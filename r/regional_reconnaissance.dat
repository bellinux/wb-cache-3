40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the potential of remote sensing data for mapping wide areas of different soil units within the arid environment. Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data were analyzed to determine how well they enable us to discriminate different soil units in Central Saudi Arabia (A 1 -Qasseem). Processing and analyzing the TM data indicated that maximum discrimination of all soil units in this study area is provided by the use of a Selective Principal Component transformation, with the use of such imagery up to 90 % of the mapped soil units can be differentiated. This study shows that there is an agreement between soil maps made by traditional soil survey at <b>regional</b> and <b>reconnaissance</b> levels for certain areas and the Landsat TM image. This agreement may be due to a number of factors which include: 1) Scale similarity. 2) The studied soil profile is homogeneous throughout or derived from unique parent material. 3) The base map in traditional soil survey is derived from photo interpretation which considers the landforms as a base in discriminating various mapping units. In general, Landsat TM data can be regarded as an effective tool to be used as a base map for <b>regional</b> and <b>reconnaissance</b> soil survey...|$|R
5000|$|Chromite is {{the source}} of {{chromium}} used commercially and as an alloying element {{plays an important role in}} metallurgy. Balochistan is endowed with huge reserves of chromite. The first discovery was made at Muslim Bagh and Khanozai in district Kila Saifullah in 1901. [...] Muslim Bagh deposits were first discovered by Vredenburg during the same period in the course of <b>regional</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> mapping of the province. Chromite mining has not been systematic but random and totally disorganised. It is mined by both open pit and underground methods. In Muslimbagh, Ras Koh Range and Wad areas, chromite is mostly mined by open pit method. However, due to podiform nature of the chromite, underground mining is also done. Use of donkeys for hauling the ore from underground is still in practice. The haulage machinery is also used. Presently, 300 to 500 tons of chromite are being produced at Muslim Bagh and Khanozai daily. It is taken in trucks to Karachi where it is crushed and packed in bags for export to foreign countries. Price depends on chrome content. China is a big market for the Balochistan chromite. Production activity in the sector directly depends upon the export market. The Provincial Inspectorate of Mines is responsible for regulating the mining operations. Presently, a few local companies are engaged at Muslim Bagh. The sources added that during the 1970s, Pakistan Chrom Mines (PCM) project was launched in Muslim Bagh area which was closed in 1989 due to financial constraints and lack of locally available technical staff.

40|$|High and low albedo lineations in {{a valley}} {{entering}} a pit in Lucaya crater are overlain by a currently immobile dune field. We propose that they are an aeolianite that formed as the overlying dunes migrated. Implicit in this is the suggestion that available water promoted early cementation of evaporitic minerals. We propose that the deposit likely resulted {{from a combination of}} locally sourced carbonate minerals and transient groundwater, both of which were made available after the formation of the pit crater. We do not exclude other aerial or subsurface sources of soluble minerals. We report on a pilot <b>regional</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> of images that finds the alternating albedo of dune sediments in Lucaya crater is found elsewhere on Mars. This suggests a regional sediment source at the time of dune activity. We examine a coastal interdune site in Namibia as an analogue for early geochemical cementation and interdune microtopography similar to the features observed on Mars. We find that the curvilinear interdune strata at the field site in Namibia are the preserved lee slope facies deposited by the dune as it migrated. Early cementation occurs in the interdune vadose zone due to precipitation of salts from groundwater. The formation of aeolianite in Lucaya crater supports suggestions by others that moisture is available for a significant period following crater formation.

The assemblage was laid down, altered and metasomatized during the hypothesized collapse of a Phillipine Sea-type back-arc basin which brought the westerly SB oceanic arc terrane into juxtaposition with the inboard, pre-existing Stuart Fork subduction complex, and more easterly KM terranes in an immature island arc setting. Supporting research has concentrated on elucidating the areal extent and structural/stratigraphic relations of these mafic/ultramafic Yellow Dog metavolcanic units, and has documented the insignificant degree of crustal contamination of the melts by associated terrigenous metasediments. The thermal structure and its evolution {{in the central}} KM evidently reflects surfaceward advective transport of magmatic energy derived from the partly fused downgoing oceanic slab, as well as hydrothermal fluid circulation. Clarification of the thermal evolution of this crust-constructional event in the immature basaltic island arc are the goals of the research now underway, emptying both field and geochemical methods.

40|$|Remote sensing, geophysics, and {{geochemistry}} {{were used}} in a cooperative program between the U. S. Geological Survey and the Consejo de Recursos Minerales of Mexico to develop exploration techniques for porphyry copper deposits in northern Sonora, Mexico. By {{the use of a}} multidisciplinary team approach, at least four northeast-trending lineament zones have been defined. These zones are interpreted to be premineral structurally defined zones that are a primary regional control of mineralization in the porphyry copper province of northern Sonora. Northwest-trending structures are also an aspect of the control of mineralization; however, our data indicates that the northwest-trending structures are pervasive, and therefore are not a useful regional prospecting uide. The northeast lineament zones postulated here are systematic and localized and therefore can be used as regional prospecting uides. The northeast-trending lineament zones are defined by concentrations of linear features oriented northeasterly, areas of limonite concentrations on the flanks of the lineament zones, subtle deflections on the regional gravity field aligned on northeast rends, anomalous geo-chemical trends oriented northeast, and the presence of known porphyry copper deposits along the lineament zones. From south to north the lineament zones are named the Cumpas, Ba-coachi, Cananea, and Nogales lineament zones. On the basis of all the data, the Nogales lineament zone appears the most promising for the location of an economic mineral deposit.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the conventional method used in surficial geochemical sampling to multimedia sampling method during reconnaissance surveys in gold exploration. The {{use of the}} conventional method in <b>regional</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> exploration surveys whereby surficial geochemical sampling is done step-wise, first by sampling stream sediments followed by rock chips then soils and other regolith materials in the search and defining of prospective targets of gold mineralization appears inefficient in geological environments characterized by complex regolith and landform modifications. However, multi-media geochemical sampling which involves the simultaneous sampling of different geochemical samples appears a better alternative and eliminates false and erratic anomalies often associated with the sampling of a single medium. Multi-media samples comprising rock chips, scree, termite mounds and lateritic lags, were collected simultaneously to support stream sediments {{in parts of the}} Ashanti belt in the Birimian of southwest Ghana, which is characterized by complex regolith and landform modifications. The most prospective targets among the three anomalous zones defined by the stream survey were better pronounced {{with the support of the}} other media, based on the consistency in significant gold contents in those samples. Gold assay values from the multi-media samples ranked the Manso East target as the most prospective and the Manso Northwest target being least prospective due to the inconsistent gold assay values in the different media. Thus the integration of the gold assay values from the various media defined real and prospective geochemical gold targets better than in the conventional method in which sampling of different media was done in stages. Unlike the conventional method, the multi-media survey provided gold results that showed regional, proximal and in-situ anomalies simultaneously. Multi-media geochemical survey therefore, appears to be a reliable method that can be used in regional surficial geochemical exploration for gold in areas characterized by hidden anomalies...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{interpretation}} of large airborne transient electromagnetic (ATEM) datasets is highly desirable for timely decision-making in exploration. Full solution 3 D inversion of entire airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys is often still not feasible on current day PCs. Therefore, two algorithms to perform rapid approximate 3 D {{interpretation of}} AEM have been developed. The loss of rigour {{may be of}} little consequence if {{the objective of the}} AEM survey is <b>regional</b> <b>reconnaissance.</b> Data coverage is often quasi- 2 D rather than truly 3 D in such cases, belying the need for 2 ̆ 7 exact 2 ̆ 7 3 D inversion. Incorporation of geological constraints reduces the non-uniqueness of 3 D AEM inversion. Integrated interpretation can be achieved most readily when inversion is applied to a geological model, attributed with lithology as well as conductivity. Geological models also offer several practical advantages over pure property models during inversion. In particular, they permit adjustment of geological boundaries. In addition, optimal conductivities can be determined for homogeneous units. Both algorithms described here can operate on geological models; however, they can also perform 2 ̆ 7 unconstrained 2 ̆ 7 inversion if the geological context is unknown. VPem 1 D performs 1 D inversion at each ATEM data location above a 3 D model. Interpretation of cover thickness is a natural application; this is illustrated via application to Spectrem data from central Australia. VPem 3 D performs 3 D inversion on time-integrated (resistive limit) data. Conversion to resistive limits delivers a massive increase in speed since the TEM inverse problem reduces to a quasi-magnetic problem. The time evolution of the decay is lost during the conversion, but the information can be largely recovered by constructing a starting model from conductivity depth images (CDIs) or 1 D inversions combined with geological constraints if available. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated on Spectrem data from Brazil. Both separately and in combination, these programs provide new options to exploration and mining companies for rapid interpretation of ATEM surveys...|$|E

Bateson and others (1983) have reported on the first phase of this work. The present report covers a further four areas. Soil geochemistry of each was examined in samples obtained from a regular grid together with ground magnetic measurements. In one area, Brown Moor, a programme of exploratory drilling (4 holes) was also undertaken. At Todridge Fell, Wheathill and Brown Moor the surface geochemical data indicate that faulting in the Whin Sill, is accompanied by mineralisation. The amount and type of such mineralisation is, however, not determinable except in the case of Brown Moor where the short drilling programme indicates alteration of the Whin accompanied by identifiable mineralisation particularly with respect to Mn, Ba and Pb. The work undertaken at Wesley resulted in the definition in soils of a linear zone enriched in Ba with associated higher than background values of Pb and En. A weak linear magnetic feature does not coincide with the surface geochemical "highs". The data cannot be used conclusively to determine the origin of these highs; mineralisation associated with a fault structure or a stratabound concentration are possible. As with the occurrences at Todridge and Wheathill, the source of the geochemical anomalies could only be determined by drilling. The work in these four areas, together with the &ta obtained at Newbrough (Bateson and others, 19831, indicates that in areas underlain by the Whin Sill magnetic methods can be used to identify fault structures affecting this basic body, with which alteration and mineralisation may be associated...|$|R

The two earthquakes, which we refer to as the South Rigan events, occurred close to one another at the northern margin of the Shahsavaran mountains: a mainly volcanic chain in which the potential for active faulting has not previously been considered in detail. Surface displacements mapped using SAR interferometry, multiple-event relocation analysis of epicentres, body-waveformmodelling and field measurements of surface rupture together reveal that the 2010 December 20 earthquake involved an average of ~ 1. 3 m right-lateral slip on a vertical fault trending ~ 210 ° whereas the 2011 January 27 resulted from ~ 0. 6 m of slip on a conjugate left-lateral fault striking ~ 310 °, parallel to the trend of the Shahsavaran mountains and confined within a zone of increased Coulomb stress from the earlier main shock. The main slip for the 2010 and 2011 main shocks failed to reach the surface though minor cracks and en-echelon fissures were mapped following both events. Some of the surface cracks may have been enhanced during a period of minor afterslip in the days following the 2010 main shock. Using the insights gained from our investigation of the two South Rigan earthquakes we perform a <b>regional</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> of the active faulting using SPOT 5 (2. 5 m) satellite imagery. We show that distributed ~N-S right-lateral faulting is widely distributed north of the Shahsavaran mountains. We also show evidence for left-lateral strike-slip faulting parallel to the Shahsavaran mountains, with a component of extension in the east and shortening in the west, which is likely to accommodate regional N-S right-lateral shearing by clockwise rotation about a vertical axis. The distributed strike-slip faulting is closely associated with the distribution of towns and villages and constitutes a continuing hazard to local populations. © The Authors 2013.

40|$|Investigations of the {{vegetation}} of the Otavi Mountainland in northern South West Africa were undertaken {{during the period}} 1970 - 1972. These had two primary objectives; firstly {{an evaluation of the}} influence of individual environmental factors on the distribution of vegetation units and secondly, an assessment of the roles of geobotany and biogeochemistry in exploration for copper, lead and zinc ores in the particular environment characteristic of this part of Africa. <b>Regional</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> studies were followed by detailed field investigations involving the collection of soil and plant samples for subsequent laboratory analysis for trace elements. The results of these investigations form the subject of this thesis. The study area is characterised by a sequence of predominantly calcareous rocks, mainly dolomites and limestones, of the Nosib Formation and Damara System, both of Proterozoic age. The more resistant rocks build striking mountain ranges which rise abruptly from broad flat floored valleys which are covered with younger depositional material. The ranges carry forms of Open Low Savanna Woodland, a low tree Savanna in which the trees are relatively closely spaced, while the valleys carry a Low Tree and Shrub Savanna in which the trees are widely to closely spaced in a fairly dense grass cover. The geobotanical investigations disclosed close distributional relationship between vegetation associations and lithological units. They revealed the considerable influence of calcrete and calcareous bedrock on the composition of {{the vegetation}} associations. Change of species distribution imparting differences of pattern within vegetation associations and the occurrence of possible indicator plants were discovered in the vicinities of known mineralised areas. The biogeochemical investigations revealed a number of areas with weak anomalies in the copper, zinc and lead contents of the leaves and twigs of the trees and shrubs which were sampled. Some of these anomalies occurred over areas with outcropping mineralised bedrock where they supported and confirmed the geochemical anomalies disclosed by soil sampling.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Rocks {{south of}} the Main Mantle Thrust (MMT) in Swat, Pakistan consist {{predominantly}} of Precambrian to Paleozoic granitic gneisses and metasedimentary rocks that represent the deformed and metamorphosed northern margin of the Indian subcontinent. In the Karakar Pass area the rocks are divisible into three lithologic units: the Swat granite gneisses, the Alpurai schists, and the Nikanai Ghar marbles. The Swat granite gneisses may represent the basement upon which the Alpurai schists were deposited. The Nikanai Ghar marbles are interpreted to form a large fault-and-fold nappe, here named the Nikanai Ghar nappe, that has been juxtaposed against the Alpurai schists. The rocks have undergone at least three deformations (D 1, D 2, and D 3) and have been metamorphosed to the green-schist to epidote-amphibolite facies (M 1). The first deformation, Dl, took place synchronously with M 1 at about 550 to 425 degrees C {{at a depth of}} approximately 20 km. It produced a pervasive regional foliation (S 1) in both the Swat granite gneisses and metasedimentary rocks, which is generally parallel to the original lithologic layering but is locally axial-planar to small, tight to isoclinal F 1 folds. D 2 is associated with retrograde metamorphism (M 2) and folded S 1 into open to tight F 2 folds that range in size from small crenulations to folds of kilometer scale. It locally caused the development of an S 2 crenulation cleavage or axial-planar mineral foliation. Associated with D 2 was the formation of the Nikanai Ghar nappe. D 3 formed large-scale regional cross-folds. Detailed mapping in the Karakar Pass area, <b>regional</b> <b>reconnaissance,</b> and interpretation of existing regional geologic maps suggest that the Swat granite gneisses and Alpurai schists may form a large recumbent fold nappe. The structural and metamorphic characteristics of rocks {{south of the}} MMT may be {{similar to those of the}} Pennine Zone of the European Alps. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age-spectrum dates from hornblende that crystallized syntectonically with D 1 -M 1 give an age of 37 - 40 Ma for this episode. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar muscovite dates may limit the youngest age for D 2 and nappe formation to about 30 Ma. Results of this study show the existence of early Himalayan-aged metamorphism in rocks south of the MMT. MMT thrusting, Barrovian-type metamorphism, and intense deformation began at least as early as late Eocene and probably continued until mid to late Oligocene...|$|E

Based in Darwin, Northern Territory, {{he was responsible}} for <b>regional</b> air defence, <b>reconnaissance,</b> protection of Allied shipping and, later, offensive operations in the New Guinea campaign. Cole found the command in [...] "good shape" [...] but considered its air defence capability inadequate, recommending augmentation by long-range fighters such as the P-38 Lightning. He nevertheless had to make do with the three squadrons of Spitfires already on his strength, and the possibility of calling on the USAAF's Fifth Air Force for reinforcements as necessary. During August and September, he reduced regular reconnaissance missions to [...] "increase bombing activity to the limit", following a request from General Douglas MacArthur to provide all available support for Allied assaults on Lae–Nadzab. North-Western Area B-24 Liberators, Hudsons, Beaufighters and Catalinas carried out raids to destroy Japanese bases and aircraft, and divert enemy forces from Allied columns. Through March and April 1944, Cole had thirteen squadrons under his control, and was supporting amphibious operations against Hollandia and Aitape. In May, he directed bombing from North-Western Area on Surabaya as part of Operation Transom.|$|R
40|$|A <b>regional</b> geochemical {{drainage}} <b>reconnaissance</b> programme {{was undertaken}} over 900 km 2 of south-west Scotland centred on the Fleet granitic complex. Rocks of Ordovician and Silurian age outcrop over the area, into {{which have been}} intruded the Fleet and Loch Doon plutons. Multi-element analysis of stream sediments and heavy mineral concentrates shows a number of patterns of trace element distribution related to different lithologies and to mineralisation. Broad scale patterns exhibited by some elements denote compositional variations within the Lower Palaeozoic sediments and within the Fleet and Loch Doon plutons. On thebasis of the drainage data the sedimentary rocks have been divided into eight distinct geochemical units each characterised by different element distribution patterns. The Fleet and Loch Doon plutons have been sub-divided on the same basis. Follow-up investigations of drainage anomalies led {{to the discovery of}} both structure-controlled and disseminated base metal mineralisation in the Penkiln drainage basin within the salthernaureole of the Loch Doon granite. The distribution of Cu, F’b and Zn to the south and south-west of the Fleet granite suggests a zonation of vein minerahsation, with Cu prominent adjacent to the granite contact and F’b and Zn having a wider dispersion away from the granite. Other anomalies delineate a mineralised lineament that follows the regional strike of the Lower Palaeozoic sediments, southeast of the Fleet granite...|$|R
40|$|Satellite constellations {{provide the}} {{infrastructure}} to implement {{some of the}} most important global services of our times both in civilian and military applications, ranging from telecommunications to global positioning, and to observation systems. Flower Constellations constitute a set of satellite constellations characterized by periodic dynamics. They have been introduced while trying to augment the existing design methodologies for satellite constellations. The dynamics of a Flower Constellation identify a set of implicit rotating reference frames on which the satellites follow the same closed-loop relative trajectory. In particular, when one of these rotating reference frames is ?Planet Centered, Planet Fixed?, then all the orbits become compatible (or resonant) with the planet; consequently, the projection of the relative path on the planet results in a repeating ground track. The satellite constellations design methodology currently most utilized is the Walker Delta Pattern or, more generally, Walker Constellations. The set of orbital planes and initial spacecraft positions are represented by a set of only three integers and two real parameters rather than by all the orbital elements; Flower Constellations provide a more general framework in which most of the former restrictions are removed, by allowing the use of resonant elliptical orbits. Flower Constellations can represent hundreds of spacecraft with a set of 6 integers and 5 real parameters only and existing constellations can be easily reproduced. How to design a Flower Constellation to satisfy specific mission requirements is an important problem for promoting the acceptance of this novel concept by the space community. Therefore one of the main goals of this work is that of proposing design techniques that can be applied to satisfy practical mission requirements. The results obtained by applying Global optimization techniques, such as Genetic Algorithms, to some relevant navigation and Earth observation space-based systems show that the Flower Constellations not only are as effective asWalker Constellations, but can also be applied to non-traditional constellation problem domains, such as <b>regional</b> coverage and <b>reconnaissance...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of geochemical {{maps of the}} world as proposed by the International Geochemical Mapping project (IGM) will require sampling of new areas at low densities and amalgamation of new data with existing geochemical data to ensure map production within reasonable time scales and budgets. Assuming compatibility in sampling and analytical techniques, two important considerations regarding sample density are: (i) how far can sample densities be reduced before meaningful geochemical patterns are lost, and (ii) how can datasets of different sample density be amalgamated? These considerations are examined in the present study by applying two methods of computational data reduction simulating low density sampling to the British Geological Survey's high precision, high resolution (1 sample per 1. 5 km 2) stream sediment datasets for Northern Britain, exemplified by Ni and B. A series of grids with grid squares of 25 km 2, 100 km 2, 500 km 2 and 160000 km 2 corresponding to sample densities recommended elsewhere for IGM (Table 1) are superimposed on the data. For each grid square the data are reduced by (i) selecting a single sample at random, and (ii) calculating the median value. Results are presented as a suite of image processed maps contoured with similar percentile levels enabling comparisons of element distributions to be made. The maps demonstrate that geochemical patterns become distorted at sample densities lower than 1 per 25 km 2 using the random selection method. Random sub-sampling of existing datasets with high sample densities is therefore unlikely to be successful. Employing the median value method, geochemical patterns are maintained with a reasonable degree of accuracy to densities as low as 1 sample per 500 km 2. The optimum reduced sample density for the Northern Britain datasets for Ni and B is 1 per 25 km 2. The size of the geological feature (s) and the magnitude of the geochemical variation are the principle factors controlling the resolution of geochemical patterns at low sample densities. Hence it is unrealistic to recommend an optimum sample density suitable for geochemical mapping throughout the world. Additional factors which influence the choice of sample density include the objectives of the survey (eg. <b>regional</b> <b>reconnaissance,</b> mineral reconnaissance, environmental monitoring), logistical controls on sampling (access, vegetation, climate etc.) and funding constraints.

40|$|The central {{question}} of this thesis is: what is {{hidden under the}} ice sheet of Antarctica? To unravel the tectonic structure and to study the geodynamic evolution of Antarctica are not only of fundamental geological interest. Knowledge of the amalgamation and break-up of supercontinents provides basic information for studying {{the evolution of the}} climate and the biosphere during Earth s history. Furthermore, knowledge about the tectonic structure of Antarctica is essential for estimating its crustal heat flow, a key parameter when modeling ice flow and future changes of ice sheets. The Antarctic ice sheet is mostly several kilometers thick, and rocks crop out of it in only a few locations to allow direct geological sampling. None of these locations is in the innermost parts of the continent. Hence, <b>regional</b> geophysical <b>reconnaissance</b> and a correlation of its data with geological findings are required for unraveling the tectonic structure of Antarctica. In recent decades, the Jurassic break-up process of Gondwana has been reconstructed based on analyses of the magnetic striping pattern of the oceanic crust, making it apparent that East Antarctica was positioned centrally in this supercontinent between Africa, India, Australia, and New Zealand throughout Paleozoic and Early Mesozoic times. However, fundamental data about the tectonic structure of East Antarctica that would be needed to better understand the assembly of Gondwana in Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic times, as well as about earlier collision and break-up processes, are still missing. This study pursues {{the question of whether the}} interior of East Antarctica is composed of one or many crustal fragments. Its method objective is to search for the courses of supraregional shear zones and the positions of crustal blocks and their boundaries. For this purpose, the Alfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholtz-Zentrum fu&# 776;r Polar- und Meeresforschung (AWI) has undertaken systematic airborne geophysical surveying in the region of Dronning Maud Land (DML) and Coats Land over the last decades. The data set includes ice-penetrating radar, aeromagnetic and areogravity measurements. Interpretation of the magnetic and gravity anomaly pattern caused by the rocks below the ice and the resulting conclusions are based on geological findings in DML and adjacent regions in East Antarctica and southern Africa. One substantial result of this thesis for understanding of the tectonic structure of East Antarctica is the discovery of a distinct aerogeophysical province in southeastern DML. It is concluded that the magnetic and gravity anomaly data of this province can be regarded as the signature of a discrete crustal fragment. This southeastern DML province is interpreted to have collided with southern Africa as part of the Pan-African amalgamation of Gondwana, during which the Grenvillian Namaqua-Natal-Maud belt was deformed within central DML. The prominent Forster Magnetic Anomaly might represent the suture zone of this collision. Aeromagnetic data of the Geodynamic Evolution of East Antarctica (GEA) project reveal an eastward extent of the southeastern DML province into the southern Sør Rondane region, while several smaller terranes, shear zones, and tectonic boundaries are mapped farther north. It is shown how the airborne geophysical data invite an interpretation of the central Sør Rondane region as a distinct tectonic unit with a presumably increased crustal thickness. Furthermore, the eastern boundary of the BLM craton in Coats Land is mapped and its prominent magnetic anomaly pattern is shown to be unique within DML and southern Africa, raising the question of the provenance of this crustal fragment, which appears not to have been high-grade reworked during the Pan-African orogeny. In contrast, the Kohnen lineament is interpreted as a Pan-African shear zone with similarities to the outcropping Heimfront shear zone. In addition, a detailed study and modeling of the Giæver Magnetic Anomaly show that it is likely to be the signal of a shallow subcrop of banded iron formation. With the multiplicity of these findings, results, and conclusions, this thesis contributes significant new knowledge and future prospects for unraveling the tectonic structure and the geodynamic evolution of East Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|No presente trabalho buscou-se compor um quadro geológico-estrutural da Faixa Paraguai meridional e compreender as relações estratigráficas entre os litotipos da Formação Puga e grupos Cuiabá e Corumbá. Foram realizados trabalhos de reconhecimento geológico e perfis geológico-estruturais de detalhe, com análise estrutural e petrográfica, em conjunto com a integração de dados e mapas existentes, análise de imagens de satélite, fotos aéreas e modelos digitais de terreno. A Faixa Paraguai meridional evoluiu como um típico fold-andthrust belt. A evolução geológica do cinturão principia por processos de rifteamento, provavelmente no final do Criogeniano, evoluindo para mar restrito e margem passiva até o final do Ediacarano. A fase rifte é caracterizada pelas formações Puga e Cerradinho. A fase margem passiva está representada pelas formações Bocaina, Tamengo e Guaicurus. Propõe-se que o Grupo Cuiabá na área estudada seja constituído por depósitos marinhos profundos, turbidíticos distais depositados comitantemente aos sedimentos do Grupo Corumbá. O processo colisional responsável pela inversão da bacia com a deformação e metamorfismo associados ocorreu durante o Cambriano, com magmatismo pós-colisional no Cambriano Superior. O estilo estrutural torna-se progressivamente mais complexo de oeste para leste. São observadas até três fases de dobramento coaxiais sobrepostas com eixos subhorizontais de direção N-S. Associam-se a sistemas de falhas de empurrão com deslocamento da capa para oeste. As lineações de estiramento e indicadores cinemáticos observados sugerem que a convergência colisional em direção ao bloco Rio Apa que deu origem à faixa móvel não foi completamente frontal, existindo algum grau de obliquidade, com vetores de convergência em torno de WNWENE. Os micaxistos do Grupo Cuiabá mostram o estilo estrutural mais complexo, com três fases de dobramentos coaxiais e foliações tectônicas mais intensas. Haveria correlação {{temporal}} entre S 3 gerada nos micaxistos, comumente referidos como Grupo Cuiabá, a leste com a foliação S 2 gerada na porção central e a clivagem S 1 gerada no limite da área cratônica a oeste, padrão que pode ser explicado pela migração do front deformacional de leste para oeste. É sugestivo que as principais falhas de empurrão coincidam com limites bacinais importantes, onde ocorrem variações de espessura e representatividades das formações basais. No processo de inversão da bacia provavelmente os empurrões reativaram as antigas falhas lístricas principais do estágio rifte. This work aims {{to characterize}} the geological and structural context of the Southern Paraguay Folded Belt, and to understand the stratigraphic relationships between the Puga Formation, Corumbá and Cuiabá groups. <b>Regional</b> geological <b>reconnaissance</b> work and detailed geological-structural field sections were carried out, with petrographic and structural analysis, together with integration of existing data and maps and analysis of satellite images, aerial photos and digital terrain models. The southern Paraguay Belt is a typical fold-andthrust belt. Its geological evolution began with rifting (Puga and Cerradinho formations), probably {{at the end of}} Criogenian, and evolved to restricted sea and passive margin (Bocaina, Tamengo and Guaicurus formations) in the late Ediacaran. It is proposed that the Cuiabá Group in the study area consists of distal marine deposits coeval with the Corumbá Group. The collisional process responsible for basin inversion and associated deformation and metamorphism occurred in the Cambrian, with post-collisional magmatism in the Upper Cambrian. The structural style becomes increasingly complex from west to east. Up to three overprinted coaxial folding phases are observed with north / south upright axial planes dipping to east and axes plunging gently to North or South. A system of thrust faults is associated with displacement of the hangwall to the west. Down-dip to oblique and strike-slip stretching lineations are also observed, with kinematic indicators showing movement varying from inverse to sinistral. This suggests that the collisional convergence toward the Rio Apa block which generated the mobile belt was not strictly frontal, but had some degree of obliquity, with convergence vectors around SSW - ENE. The Cuiabá Group mica-schists show the most complex structural style with three superimposed coaxial fold phases and more intense tectonic foliations. It is proposed that there would be time correlation between the S 3 foliation in the mica-schists in the easternmost area, with the S 2 foliation in the central area and the S 1 cleavage at the limit of the cratonic area to the west. This pattern {{can be explained by the}} westward migration of the deformational front. It is suggestive that the main thrusts coincide with major basin boundaries, where greater variations in thickness and expression of the basal formations occur. During the basin inversion the thrusts probably reactivated the former main listric faults of the rift stage...|$|R
