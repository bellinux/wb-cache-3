5000|$|This {{regulation}} {{enables a}} somewhat simplified route by establishing transmitting and receiving agencies {{in each of}} the <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> Some <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have a de-centralised system with many transmitting and receiving agencies, whereas others have a single centralised agency. The transmitting agency in one <b>member</b> <b>state</b> sends the judicial documents to the receiving agency who is then responsible for service. A Letter Rogatory is not necessary, as a standardised request form included in the annex to the regulation must be used. This aids the process by being widely recognised by the relevant authorities. In addition to service through the <b>recipient</b> <b>member</b> <b>state's</b> receiving agency or agencies, Article 14 of the regulation permits service on defendants directly by mail. Article 15 of the regulation allows for [...] "direct service" [...] through competent judicial officials in the <b>member</b> <b>state,</b> although some <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have opted out of that article.|$|R

Alongside traditional tensions, newer ones have emerged, including the effect of EU enlargement in 2004 - 7, which has increased demand on spending, and the effect of the post- 2008 economic crises, which has likewise increased demand for spending though faced by conflicting demands for austerity. Finally, the Lisbon Treaty reinforces the power to block agreement on reform to the budget. With the EU due to announce a new budget in 2013, this volume evaluates the prospects for major change to expenditure and the structure of the budget for the period starting in 2014...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{unprecedented}} scale of intergovernmental development funding {{and the importance}} of institutional quality for human wellbeing, it is imperative to precisely understand the impact of development funds on corruption. In Europe, EU Funds provide a boost to public spending in <b>recipient</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> while introducing additional corruption controls. We investigate whether EU Funds increase high-level corruption in the Czech Republic and Hungary in 2009 - 2012. We analyse newly collected data from over 100, 000 public procurement contracts to develop objective corruption risk indicators and link them to agency-level data of the public sector. Propensity score matching estimations suggest that EU funds increase corruption risks by up to 34 %. The negative effects are largely attributable to overly formalistic compliance and EU Funds overriding domestic accountability mechanisms in public organisations entirely dependent on external funds. The policy implications are profound: governments should reduce barriers to market entry by lowering red tape and they should prevent excessive concentration of funds.

40|$|The European Elections of 2014 were {{characterized}} {{by the rise of}} populist parties. Using cross-national data from the “Comparative Electoral Dynamics in the European Union in 2014 ” survey, this paper looks at what motivates voters to vote for both left and right-wing populists, and the relation between populist voting and EU integration across contributor and <b>recipient</b> EU <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> We find that supporters of populist parties on the left and right demonstrate higher levels of mistrust towards political institutions in both groups of countries, while diverging in terms of their economic and sociocultural attitudes. Left populist supporters in receiving countries tend to be more skeptical regarding EU integration than the populist left in contributing countries. In the latter, euroscepticism has a marginal effect on support for left wing populist parties while it shows a strong impact on right wing populist voting, in relation to cultural conservatism, anti-globalization and economic protectionism...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePopulist {{parties are}} a stable entity within European party systems. However, what is {{interesting}} is that the electoral support for populist parties is unevenly distributed between the North, the South, and Eastern Europe. In the North we tend to find populist radical right parties, in the South populist left parties, and in Eastern Europe it is more variegated. The question is: Are there different dynamics between the regions that explains these trends {{and what are the}} differences that account for the varying electoral fortunes of those parties? To address this question, we examine why voters support populist parties, but within different contexts. To do so, we use two successive waves of the European Election Study survey in 2009 and 2014, with macro socio-economic data and expert data on party positions from CHES surveys 2010 and 2014. We perform a multi-level analysis which combines two nested levels, namely voters and country. Looking first at voters, we anticipate similarities and a number of differences. We expect lack of political trust, similar economic attitudes, and opposition to globalization and the EU to unite left and right populist voters. However, we also expect that the radical right voters are anti-immigrant and authoritarian, while the populist radical left voters should favour equality and state intervention. However, we also expect country level variation. We expect higher levels of immigration to increase the propensity to vote for the populist radical right, while higher levels of unemployment will increase the propensity to vote for the populist left. However, we expect that Euroscepticism operates differently in northern and southern European countries, reflecting variation in levels of public support for EU integration, and the current fiscal redistribution between contributor/ <b>recipient</b> EU <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> We consider these implications for understanding populist electoral dynamics in Europe...|$|R
40|$|Cohesion policy micro-efficiency is {{determined}} by institutional or absorption capacity of <b>recipient</b> regions and <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> which, in turn, co-determines the policy’s macroeconomic impact. The analysis shows that cohesion policy is not perceived as an “EU receipts maximising instrument”, but instead that it is understood {{as a means to}} the set objectives, i. e. that it is about the genuine impact. At the same time however, the analysis also shows that proper change in the implementation systems is needed. The paper puts forward four proposals for improvements, the most radical of them, the “coordinated full decentralisation”, conceives cohesion policy as a bulk transfer of investment-conditioned financial resources, where full responsibility for the legality, regularity, efficiency and effectiveness would be entirely transferred to the Member States/regional level. The analysis reveals that subsidiarity principle is still not taken into account to a satisfactory degree, that experience and political context have significant influence on the (optimal) design of implementation systems and finally that, on average, there seems to be merit in concentration both with regards to the number of operational programmes (less so for their thematic focus) {{as well as to the}} number of institutions involved in the implementation systems, horizontally and especially vertically.

40|$|From the introduction]. My {{study will}} focus in {{particular}} on three claims {{made in the}} literature about <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. The first claim is that <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation was initially low and {{that much of the}} Court's constitutionalization of the Treaty occurred when <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were simply too inattentive to notice the magnitude of the Court's activity. The second claim is that early <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation reflected a concern to protect national laws, but that this pattern of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation is changing as <b>member</b> <b>state</b> evince more of a desire to influence the general trend of Commmunity law. The final claim tested is that, with the Single European Act's change to qualified majority voting in the Council, member states' attitudes of acceptance toward the Court will change, and criticism of the Court will increase. This hypothesis is {{based on the belief that}} the supranationalism of the ECJ was accepted because of the intergovernmentalism of the Council. The data on <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation suggests, however, that none of these claims provide an accurate picture of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. While there has been an increase in participation over time, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have shown a high degree of participation in Article 177 cases from the outset. Further, trends in <b>member</b> <b>states</b> participation do not provide adequate empirical proof of a change in <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation from self-interest to a Community interest. Finally, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> do not appear to have changed their behavior toward the Court since the passage of the Single European Act...|$|R
