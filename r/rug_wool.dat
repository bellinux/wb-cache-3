The mill processed wool from when it left the sheep's back until it was ready for the loom or knitting machine.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in order to {{investigate}} the indoor exposure to permethrin, in rooms containing wool textile floor coverings. In 80 private homes with <b>wool</b> <b>rugs</b> and <b>wool</b> wall-to-wall carpets, the concentration of permethrin was monitored in wool fibres, in house dust and on airborne particles. The concentrations of permethrin in wool fibres varied from < 1 to 245 mg permethrin/kg wool fibre. The permethrin concentrations in house dust ranged from < 1 to 659 mg/kg. Permethrin was found in very low concentrations on airborne particles. Independent on the permethrin concen trations in house dust, in most cases the concentrations varied between < 1 and 6 ng/m 3. The observed statistical correlations indicate that the indoor air permethrin level may be caused by a small fraction of wool fibres which are suspended in the air...|$|R

50|$|In most oriental rugs, {{the pile}} is of sheep's wool. Its {{characteristics}} and quality vary from each {{area to the}} next, depending on the breed of sheep, climatic conditions, pasturage, and the particular customs relating to when and how the wool is shorn and processed. In the Middle East, <b>rug</b> <b>wools</b> come mainly from the fat-tailed and fat-rumped sheep races, which are distinguished, as their names suggest, by the accumulation of fat in the respective parts of their bodies. Different areas of a sheep's fleece yield different qualities of wool, depending on the ratio between the thicker and stiffer sheep hair and the finer fibers of the wool. Usually, sheep are shorn in spring and fall. The spring shear produces wool of finer quality. The lowest grade of wool used in carpet weaving is “skin” wool, which is removed chemically from dead animal skin. Fibers from camels and goats are also used. Goat hair is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvages, of Baluchi and Turkmen rugs, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Middle Eastern rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel's wool {{turns out to be}} dyed sheep wool.|$|R

50|$|Iranians {{were some}} of the first people in history to weave carpets.
