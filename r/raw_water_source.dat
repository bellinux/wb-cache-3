40|$|Approximately 800 {{million people}} live without clean {{drinking}} water. Diarrhoea is responsible for between 1. 7 and 2 million deaths each year (primarily children) which {{are the result of}} poor drinking water quality and sanitation. The main aim {{of this study was to}} demonstrate the production of drinking water from a <b>raw</b> <b>water</b> <b>source</b> using an off-grid drinking water production system. The off-grid drinking water production system (DWPS) developed at UWE Bristol, combines an ultra-filtration (UF) system with in situ generation of electrochemically activated solutions (ECAS). ECAS has two functional roles within the system; to manage biofilms within the UF system and as a disinfectant. Integrated in-situ probes (pH, oxidation reduction potential, chlorine, conductivity and dissolved oxygen) coupled with a water quality sensing network (pH, water temperature, conductivity and dissolved oxygen) enabled real time monitoring of; the operational efficiency of the DWPS, and the physicochemical parameters of both the <b>raw</b> <b>water</b> <b>source</b> and the produced drinking water. Spot samples of both raw and treated water were sent for independent chemical and microbial analysis at an accredited laboratory which demonstrated that the DWPS produced biologically safe potable drinking water according to the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) standards. Samples from the <b>raw</b> <b>water</b> <b>source</b> were shown to be consistently unsuitable for human consumption, failing several of the DWI standards for potable water supply, including coliform bacteria.

NOM removal by UF is low, which correlates with the average MW determined by SEC with an average value of 922 g/mol (between 833 and 1031 g/mol). However, the NOM removal obtained with the NF 90 and NF 270 NF membranes for all <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> is almost complete (90 %). THMFP removal is related to hydrophobicity and permeability of membrane. The NFT 50 membrane removes almost 100 % of the THMFP of more hydrophobic waters...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this work was to analyse how water companies are affected by climate change and how they try to adapt to it. Therefore, a systematic literature review was being accomplished. The work is being divided into a theoretical and a methodological part. First of all {{an overview of the}} climatic changes that are projected to occur during the next years is being given. Then, resulting impacts on the water cycle are being pointed out. Furthermore, <b>raw</b> <b>water</b> <b>sources,</b> <b>water</b> companies obtain water from are being defined as well as the treatment process. Within the methodological part the approach of a systematic literature review is being applied, which includes the selection of references as well as their evaluation. The results of the literature review are that concerning the effects of climate change on water companies, the risks water providers might face, clearly predominate possible opportunities. Especially the deterioration of the <b>raw</b> <b>water</b> quality caused by increasing temperatures, floods as well as heavy rainfalls {{can be seen as a}} serious problem. Moreover, the most often mentioned adaptation strategies are dealing with quantitative water problems such as measures to increase storage as well as treatment capacity or leakage reductions. All in all it can be stated that there is still uncertainty about how climate change is going to effect water companies, especially concerning water quality changes and the treatment process...|$|R
