5000|$|Regional {{constraints}} {{affect the}} availability of education, most commonly in <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>Statistical</b> analysis has found a high correlation rate between parents and children’s educational attainment. Human capital gained and transferred from the educational level of parents is directly correlated with that of their children. Youth with vast human capital are able to move to larger aimag centers to continue their studies. Most higher secondary education and colleges are only available in large city’s like Mongolia’s capital Ulaanbaatar.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE We {{wanted to}} measure {{trends in the}} {{proportion}} of prenatal visits pro-vided by family physicians nationally for a 10 -year period and determine charac-teristics of prenatal visits made to family physicians compared with visits made to obstetricians. METHODS We analyzed the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to identify prenatal visits made to family physicians and obstetricians between 1995 and 2004. The primary outcome measure was the trend in proportion of prenatal visits seen by family physicians. Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined char-acteristics of a prenatal visit occurring with a family physician vs an obstetrician. RESULTS A total of 6, 203 records were included in the study, representing 244 million prenatal visits. The percentage of prenatal visits provided by family physi-cians decreased from 11. 6 % in 1995 - 1996 to 6. 1 % in 2003 - 2004 (P =. 02 for trend). In non–metropolitan <b>statistical</b> <b>areas,</b> family physicians decreased their pro-vision of prenatal visits from 38. 6 % in 1995 - 1996 to 12. 9 % in 2003 - 2004 (P =. 03 for trend). Prenatal visits made to family physicians were associated with location in a non–metropolitan <b>statistical</b> <b>area</b> (OR = 5. 56; 95 % CI, 3. 23 - 9. 62), Medicaid insurance (OR = 1. 76; 95 % CI, 1. 10 - 2. 82), and younger maternal age (aged 30 years and older vs aged less than 24 years: OR = 0. 63; 95 % CI, 0. 41 - 0. 95). CONCLUSIONS Family physicians reduced their provision of prenatal visits by nearly 50 % during a 10 -year period and at an even greater rate in <b>rural,</b> non–metropolitan <b>statistical</b> <b>areas.</b> These fi ndings should be considered as family medicine considers the role of maternity care and strives to provide accessible prenatal services for all.
