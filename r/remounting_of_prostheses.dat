40|$|This work {{describes}} {{design and}} realization of testing device for dynamic tests <b>of</b> foot <b>prosthesis,</b> made by methods of Rapid prototyping. Primary objective of design is {{to imitate the}} load on prosthesis during human gait. This task is accomplished by swing motion <b>of</b> <b>prosthesis</b> inside the frame of device during the loading of heel and tiptoe. Loading components can be removed and changed so the device {{can be used for}} different measurement like walking on an inclined plane. The result of this work is fully functional device including control program with many options to control the test. The result of test is to decide whether the foot prosthesis withstands the set of cyclic loads. The area <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> <b>prosthesis</b> by additive methods is young for the time being. It stands out especially with different materials, design, structure <b>of</b> <b>prosthesis</b> and fast process of production. Therefore this device can be used for testing of fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>prosthesis</b> made by additive methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) is {{the most}} common indication for insertion <b>of</b> a penile <b>prosthesis</b> and is a risk factor for infection <b>of</b> such <b>prostheses.</b> Case presentation Two patients presented with infected prostheses following unusual trivial penile trauma. Both patients underwent exploration and removal <b>of</b> the <b>prostheses</b> with uneventful recovery. Conclusion Appropriate sizing <b>of</b> the <b>prosthesis</b> should be taken into account to ensure good concealment and avoid easy exposure of the penis to unexpected trauma. Use of the newly designed antibiotic-coated prostheses appears preferable. As soon as signs <b>of</b> <b>prosthesis</b> infection appeared, extrusion of the device should be expedited. </p...|$|R
40|$|Lack of {{stability}} {{is known as}} one of the principal factors contributing to the loosening <b>of</b> hip <b>prosthesis.</b> Initial stability <b>of</b> the hip <b>prosthesis</b> is related to the magnitude of relative displacement at the femoral boneprosthesis interface. The present study investigated the effect <b>of</b> <b>prosthesis</b> geometry on the initial stability. In addition, the effect of hole and fin as additional features <b>of</b> <b>prosthesis</b> was also investigated. Three-dimensional (3 D) finite element model <b>of</b> femur and <b>prosthesis</b> was constructed based on Computed Tomography (CT) dataset of a Malaysian male patient. Simulations of normal walking condition were performed on the models to investigate the relative displacement between the bone and prosthesis interface. The simulation results showed that rectangular hip prosthesis contributed to the reduction of relative motion at the proximal and distal ends <b>of</b> the <b>prosthesis.</b> For the prosthesis with additional hole as a feature on the proximal region <b>of</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> the result showed that it increased the magnitude of relative displacement at the proximal region on the medial side. For the effect of fin, it was observed that the relative displacement was lower than 40 µm along the lateral and medial sides...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{footprint}} <b>of</b> most <b>prostheses</b> {{is designed}} according to Caucasian data. Total disc replacement (TDR) has been performed widely for cervical degenerative diseases in China. It {{is essential to}} analyze the match sizes <b>of</b> <b>prostheses</b> footprints and Chinese cervical anatomic dimensions in our study. Methods: The anatomic dimensions of the C 4 -C 7 segments of 138 patients (age range 16 - 77 years) in a Chinese population were measured by computed tomography scans. We compared the footprints {{of the most commonly}} used cervical disc prostheses (Bryan: Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA; Prestige LP: Medtronic, Fridley, Minnesota, USA; Discover: DePuy, Raynham, MA, USA; Prodisc-C: Synthes, West Chester, PA, USA) in China with Chinese cervical anatomic dimensions and assessed the match of their size. Results: The mismatch of available dimensions <b>of</b> <b>prostheses</b> and anatomic data of cervical endplates ranged from 17. 03 % (C 4 /C 5, Prestige LP, Prodisc-C) to 57. 61 % (C 6 /C 7, Discover) in the anterior-posterior (AP) diameter, and 35. 51 % (C 4 /C 5, Prodisc-C, Prestige LP) to 94. 93 % (C 6 /C 7, Bryan) in the center mediolateral (CML) diameter. About 21. 01 % of endplates were larger than the largest prostheses in the AP diameter and 57. 25 % in the CML diameter. All available footprints <b>of</b> <b>prostheses</b> expect the Bryan with an unfixed height, can accommodate the disc height (DH), however, 36. 23 % of the middle DH was less than the smallest height <b>of</b> the <b>prostheses.</b> The average disc sagittal angles (DSAs) of C 4 -C 7 junctions were 5. 04 °, 5. 15 °, and 4. 13 ° respectively. Only the Discover brand had a built-in 7 ° lordotic angle, roughly matching with the DSA. Conclusions: There is a large discrepancy between footprints <b>of</b> <b>prostheses</b> and Chinese cervical anatomic data. In recent years, possible complications of TDR related with mismatch sizes are increasing, such as subsidence, displacement, and heterotopic ossification. Manufacturers <b>of</b> <b>prostheses</b> should introduce or produce additional footprints <b>of</b> <b>prostheses</b> for Chinese TDR...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To gain an {{understanding}} of the embodied perceptual experience <b>of</b> successful <b>prosthesis.</b> Method: The data for this study were transcripts derived from in-depth semi-structured e-mail (n= 21) and face-to-face (n= 14) interviews, and the documentary analysis of an e-mail discussion group for prosthesis users. This qualitative data was subject to an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results: Analysis of the research data identified six themes in the perceptually embodied experiences <b>of</b> <b>prosthesis</b> users: Adjusting to a prosthetic; The Balance of the Body; Awareness of the prosthesis; The knowing body; The Phantom Becomes the Prosthesis: Extending the Body; and The Prosthesis as Tool or Corporeal Structure. Conclusion: The often-cited reasons for the rejection <b>of</b> <b>prostheses</b> are frequently part of the initial experiences <b>of</b> ‘successful’ <b>prosthesis</b> users also. This suggests the need to sufficiently motivate potential prosthesis users in the period between an experience <b>of</b> <b>prosthesis</b> use as unnatural and wieldy to one of pre-reflective, natural use. In addition, two broad forms <b>of</b> <b>prosthesis</b> experience were identified: one in which the prosthesis was experienced as a corporeal structure; and one in which it was viewed as a tool. While future work may be able to explore the psychosocial correlates of these experiences, it is nonetheless the case that persons with these differing experiences were able to enjoy the benefits imbued by prosthesis use...|$|R
