Background. Development of {{effective}} methods for evaluating solvency {{of individuals and}} risk of banks in providing consumer loans. Objective. Determining of the mechanisms for implementation of scoring models {{in the form of}} scoring cards. Analysis of the possibility of using scoring cards as a tool for credit risk management. Methods. Construction of scoring cards and preliminary analysis of input data using specialized component of the SAS Enterprise Miner. Results. The main stages of scoring cards development were considered. The scoring card was constructed that is based on actual statistical data on granting of the consumer loans. The research also presents comparative analysis of the scoring cards with other statistical methods of subjects classification. Conclusions. It was established in this study that the scoring cards have better forecasting ability than other statistical methods such as decision trees, neural networks and logistic regression. The format of development the forecasting models in the form of scoring cards is the easiest for interpreting. However, application of this method requires considerable investments as well as continuous updating and <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> histories for borrowers. ????????????. ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????? ?????????????????? ??? ? ????? ?????? ??? ?????????????? ??????????????? ????????. ???? ????????????. ??????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????? ? ???? ??????????? ?????. ?????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????? ??????????? ???? ??? ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ??????. ???????? ??????????. ?????????? ??????????? ????? ? ??????????????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ? ??????? ?????????????????? ????????? ???????

5000|$|After 1890 {{the vote}} {{share of the}} SPD rose rapidly, to reach nearly 35% in the 1912 general election, {{although}} this translated into only 110 of the 397 seats in the Reichstag, due to the distortive impact of an old-fashioned voting system and constituency boundaries that had been unchanged since 1871. The party leadership responded to the outbreak of war in 1914 with a political truce which involved voting in the Reichstag for credits to fund the war, and abstaining from criticism of the government for its duration. Support for the political truce was encouraged within the party by the spectre of life under an autocratic Russian Czar if Germany failed to win, but even in 1914 there were prominent SPD members resolutely opposed to the war, grouped around Hugo Haase: Karl Wilhelm Stolle was one of these. [...] Stolle was one of 18 SPD Reichstag members who formed themselves into the so-called Social Democratic Working Group ("Sozialdemokratische Arbeitsgemeinschaft") within the party, which on 21 December 1915 voted against the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> war <b>credits.</b> As economic destitution at home and industrial-scale slaughter on the frontline mounted, in 1917 the SPD itself broke apart and Stolle {{was one of those}} who went with the breakaway faction, forming the short-lived Independent Social Democratic Party ("Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands" [...] / USPD). [...] Three years later the USPD itself split, with a larger element of its membership joining the new Communist Party, but by that time Karl Wilhelm Stolle had died, aged 75, in March 1918.|$|R

40|$|The {{behavioural}} therapies predominantly use {{exposure to}} feared stimuli {{in the treatment}} of anxiety disorders. However, clients frequently experience a return of fear after treatment and this may increase the likelihood of relapse occurring. Return of fear via a renewal effect is the most frequently studied source of return <b>of</b> fear. <b>Renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear occurs when the previously feared object is encountered in a context that is different to the treatment context. The present chapter reviews clinical-analogue studies that have investigated the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear. Prior research has confirmed the validity <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> as a mechanism for the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear in high fearful and phobic individuals. Moreover, prior research has shown that factors such as phobic cognitions and pre-treatment fear can predict the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear occurring. The review also highlights the methodologies used to detect <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear and subsequently reduce <b>renewal.</b> Applications <b>of</b> the research to reduce the return <b>of</b> fear via <b>renewal</b> following exposure therapy are discussed.
