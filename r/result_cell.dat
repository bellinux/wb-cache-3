5000|$|Having {{social media}} in the {{classroom}} has been a controversial topic in the 2010s. Many parents and educators have been fearful of the repercussions of having social {{media in the}} classroom. There are concerns that social media tools can be misused for cyberbullying or sharing inappropriate content. As <b>result,</b> <b>cell</b> phones have been banned from some classrooms, and some schools have blocked many popular social media websites. However, despite apprehensions, students in industrialized countries are (or will be) active social media users. As a result, many schools have realized {{that they need to}} loosen restrictions, teach digital citizenship skills, and even incorporate these tools into classrooms. The Peel District School Board (PDSB) in Ontario is one of many school boards that has begun to accept the use of social media in the classroom. In 2013, the PDSB introduced a [...] "Bring Your Own Device" [...] (BYOD) policy and have unblocked many social media sites. Fewkes and McCabe (2012) have researched about the benefits of using Facebook in the classroom. Some schools permit students to use smartphones or tablet computers in class, as long as the students are using these devices for academic purposes, such as doing research.|$|E
5000|$|Feathers {{begin to}} form from feather follicles, which are invaginations {{starting}} in the epidermis down to the dermis. It is in the dermis that the follicle and the pulp cavity begin to form the feather. The pulp cavity is the space that contains the feather follicle. The feather filament soon grows out of the follicle; {{this is due to}} cell proliferation, which is an increased number of cells as a <b>result</b> <b>cell</b> growth and division, at the follicle base. These new cells form two different tissues. There is the sheath, which is the main feather tissues and pulp caps. The sheath is the supportive layer that surrounds the feather, which falls off as it grows. Similarly, the pulp caps, which protect the dermal core, also fall off as the feather grows. The main feather tissues later unfurl, which causes the disposal of the sheath and the pulp caps as it assumes its functional shape. As the feather grows, its spathe, which is where the rachis and vanes attach, continues to form. When spathe is finished developing, the calamus begins to form within the base of the spathe. The calamus is the quill of the feather, which is the bottom portion that stays mainly within the pulp cavity. From there, the feather is fully developed and will remain as such until molting occurs, causing it to fall off. Feathers fall off during molting, which occurs in the at different times through the year {{depending on the type of}} bird. Birds can molt for seasonal, reproductive and many other reasons ...|$|E

As a <b>result,</b> <b>cell</b> behaviors are critically determined by the interaction between nanoscale cellular surface components such as microvilli, filopodia, extracellular matrix (ECM), and the underlying nanostructure topography [7]. However, little is known of how the use of size and shape-matched diverse nanometer-scale topographies interact to not only the forthcoming cells but also the nanoscale cellular surface components of cells bound on the nanotopographic substrates in cell adhesion steps even at the very early stage of incubation (< 20 min).|$|E

40|$|The use of cell-laden hydrogels to {{engineer}} soft tissue has been emerging {{within the past}} years. Despite several newly developed and sophisticated techniques to encapsulate different cell types the importance of vascularization of the engineered constructs is often underestimated. As a <b>result,</b> <b>cell</b> death within a construct leads to impaired function and inclusion of the implant. Here, we discuss the fabrication of hollow channels within hydrogels as a promising strategy to facilitate vascularization. Furthermore, we present an overview on the feasible use of removable spacers, 3 D laser- and planar processing strategies to create channels within hydrogels. The implementation of these structures promotes control over cell distribution and increases oxygen transport and nutrient supply in vitro. However, many studies lack the use of endothelial cells in their approaches leaving out an important factor to enhance vessel ingrowth and anastomosis formation upon implantation. In addition, the adequate endothelial cell type needs to be considered to make these approaches bridge the gap to in vivo applications...|$|E
40|$|Lysosomal storage {{diseases}} (LSDs) are a {{group of}} more than 40 genetically inherited diseases that result from dysfunction of specific proteins, often an enzyme, located in lysosomes within cells which leads to abnormal lysosomal accumulation of specific macromolecules. As a <b>result,</b> <b>cell</b> malfunction occurs and escalates into multi-tissue and multi-organ failures, often resulting in premature death. For several early onset LSDs, {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) is also affected and manifests fatal neuropathic and/or neurodegenerative symptoms. Within the last two decades, treatment for selective LSDs has become clinically available. Specifically, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) by intravenous injection of recombinant enzymes holds relevant promise. Yet current ERT results in suboptimal enzyme biodistribution to many target organs, including the peripheral organs and also the CNS. Delivery to the CNS is particularly impeded due to the tight blood-brain barrier (BBB) that strictly regulates passage between the circulation system and the brain tissue. We explored the use of targeted drug delivery systems to address this issue. Specifically, we focused on targeting intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), a cell surfac...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{phones are}} {{ubiquitous}} today- millions of wireless consumers making billions of calls {{each year in}} the United States alone. Service providers are facing a huge growth of networks accompanied with the unfair demographic distribution that can be concentrated one day in one place and another day in a different place. A large number of callers suddenly appear during a big event in convention centers, conferences, libraries, and football stadiums. Cell phone service providers are overwhelmed with such hotspots and many calls are dropped. These calls are likely to be in close proximity and are usually short in duration. We propose a solution to relieve the infrastructure from this sudden congestion by allowing cell phone users to communicate directly using a peer-to-peer network. Cell phones handle connection establishment, routing, and maintaining the conversation with minimal infrastructure use. As a <b>result,</b> <b>cell</b> phone users can make phone calls free of any charge. Moreover, calls consume less power by using peer-to-peer communication.

40|$|Background: Peptide amphiphiles (PAs) are a {{class of}} {{amphiphilic}} molecules able to self-assemble into nanomaterials that have shown efficient in vivo targeted delivery. Understanding the interactions of PAs with cells and the mechanisms of their internalization and intracellular trafficking is critical in their further development for therapeutic delivery applications. Methodology/Principal Findings: PAs of a novel, cell- and tissue-penetrating peptide were synthesized possessing two different lipophilic tail architectures and their interactions with prostate cancer cells were studied in vitro. Cell uptake of peptides was greatly enhanced post-modification. Internalization occurred via lipid-raft mediated endocytosis and was common for the two analogs studied. On the contrary, we identified the non-peptidic part as the determining factor of differences between intracellular trafficking and retention of PAs. PAs composed of di-stearyl lipid tails linked through poly(ethylene glycol) to the peptide exhibited higher exocytosis rates and employed different recycling pathways compared to ones consisting of di-palmitic-coupled peptides. As a <b>result,</b> <b>cell</b> association of the former PAs decreased with time. Conclusions/Significance: Control over peptide intracellular localization and retention is possible by appropriate modification with synthetic hydrophobic tails. We propose this as a strategy to design improved peptide-based deliver...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cell-biomaterial {{interactions}} are strongly affected by topographical and chemical surface characteristics. We found out earlier that geometric titanium (Ti) pillar {{structures in the}} micrometer range induce the cells to rearrange their actin cytoskeleton in short fibers solely {{on the top of}} the pillars. As a <b>result,</b> <b>cell</b> physiology was hampered concerning collagen I synthesis and spreading capacity. Furthermore, the position-dependent initial cell adhesion strength was declined near the edges. We asked whether these observed cellular effects can be performed only in combination with Ti or occur independently of chemical surface features. In addition, the specific culture conditions, e. g. serum content or influence of gravity, were of interest. Human primary osteoblasts were cultured in Osteoblast Growth Medium with serum containing SupplementMix on pure silicon pillars (5 x 5 x 5 µm) or on samples additionally sputtered with Ti (as reference) or gold. To offer the cells ligands for their adhesion receptors, we coated the pillars with collagen I or alternatively with a plasma polymer layer from allylamine.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine whether chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) -induced apoptosis is prevented by ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) or tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDC) and to characterize the involvement of mitochondria in the process. Cultured human HepG 2 cells were treated in a dose- and time-dependent protocol in order to establish a sufficiently low exposure to CDCA that causes apoptosis but not necrosis. Low-dose CDCA induced an S-phase block and G 2 arrest of the cell cycle, as determined by flow cytometry. As a <b>result,</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation was inhibited. CDCA-induced apoptosis, as determined by fluorescence microscopy of Hoechst 33342 -stained nuclei, was evident upon coincubation with TUDC. Additionally, after exposure to UDCA plus CDCA, the cell membrane was permeable to fluorescent dyes. Caspase- 9 -like activity, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and extensive DNA fragmentation were detected in CDCA-exposed cells and in cells coincubated with TUDC, but not UDCA. CDCA caused a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and depletion of ATP, both of which were potentiated by UDCA but not TUDC. The results suggest that UDCA potentiates CDCA cytotoxicity, probably at the level of induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Consequently, as suggested by the lack of the main hallmarks of the apoptotic pathway, in the presence of UDCA, CDCA-induced apoptosis is not properly executed but degenerates into necrosis...|$|E
