Two major isoforms, <b>RET</b> 9 and <b>RET</b> 51, differ in the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal tail as a result of alternative splicing. To determine the roles of these isoforms in vivo, we used targeted mutagenesis to generate mice that express either <b>RET</b> 9 or <b>RET</b> 51. Monoisoformic <b>RET</b> 9 mice, which lack <b>RET</b> 51, are viable and appear normal.

25|$|Born in Gathar, Kham in 1838 {{and soon}} {{discovered}} by the official search committee {{with the help of}} Nechung Oracle, the Eleventh Dalai Lama was brought to Lhasa in 1841 and recognised, enthroned and named Khedrup Gyatso by the Panchen Lama in 1842, who also ordained him in 1846. After that he was immersed in religious studies under the Panchen Lama, amongst other great masters. Meanwhile, there were court intrigues and ongoing power struggles taking place between the various Lhasa factions, the Regent, the Kashag, the powerful nobles and the abbots and monks of the three great monasteries. The Tsemonling Regent became mistrusted and was forcibly deposed, there were machinations, plots, beatings and kidnappings of ministers and so forth, resulting at last in the Panchen Lama being appointed as interim Regent to keep the peace. Eventually the Third <b>Reting</b> Rinpoche was made Regent, and in 1855, Khedrup Gyatso, appearing to be an extremely promising prospect, was requested to take the reins of power at the age of 17. He was enthroned as ruler of Tibet in 1855 following Xianfeng Emperor's order. He died after just 11 months, no reason for his sudden and premature death being given in these accounts, Shakabpa and Mullin's histories both being based on untranslated Tibetan chronicles.

40|$|The {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} <b>Ret</b> plays {{a critical role in}} the development of the mammalian excretory and enteric nervous systems. Differential splicing of the primary <b>Ret</b> transcript results in the generation of two main isoforms, <b>Ret</b> 9 and <b>Ret</b> 51, whose C-terminal amino acid tails diverge after tyrosine (Y) 1062. Monoisoformic mice expressing only <b>Ret</b> 9 develop normally and are healthy and fertile. In contrast, animals expressing only <b>Ret</b> 51 have aganglionosis of the distal gut and hypoplastic kidneys. By generating monoisoformic mice in which Y 1062 of <b>Ret</b> 9 has been mutated to phenylalanine, we demonstrate that this amino acid has a critical role in <b>Ret</b> 9 signaling that is necessary for the development of the kidneys and the enteric nervous system. These findings argue that the distinct activities of <b>Ret</b> 9 and <b>Ret</b> 51 result from the differential regulation of Y 1062 by C-terminal flanking sequences. However, a mutation which places Y 1062 of <b>Ret</b> 51 in a <b>Ret</b> 9 context improves only marginally the ability of <b>Ret</b> 51 to support renal and enteric nervous system development. Finally, monoisoformic mice expressing a variant of <b>Ret</b> 9 in which a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif was mutated develop normally and are healthy. Our studies identify Y 1062 as a critical regulator of <b>Ret</b> 9 signaling and suggest that <b>Ret</b> 51 -specific motifs are likely to inhibit the activity of this isoform...|$|R

The mechanisms by which HOXB 5 regulate <b>RET</b> transcription are unclear. Thus, unraveling the regulatory mechanisms of HOXB 5 on <b>RET</b> transcription could lead {{to a better understanding of}} the etiology of Hirschsprung disease. In this study, we identified and confirmed HOXB 5 binding to the multi-species conserved sequence (MCS+ 9. 7) in the first intron of the <b>RET</b> gene. We developed a <b>RET</b> mini-gene reporter system, and showed that MCS+ 9. 7 enhanced HOXB 5 trans-activation from <b>RET</b> promoter in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and in chick embryos. The deletion of HOXB 5 binding site interfered with HOXB 5 trans-activation. Furthermore, transfection of HOXB 5 induced endogenous <b>RET</b> transcription, enhanced the co-precipitation of TATA-box binding protein with the transcription start site of <b>RET,</b> and induced histone H 3 K 4 trimethylation in chromatin regions upstream and downstream of <b>RET</b> transcription start site. In conclusion, (i) HOXB 5 physically interacted with MCS+ 9. 7 and enhanced <b>RET</b> transcription, (ii) HOXB 5 altered chromatin conformation and histone modification of <b>RET</b> locus, which could facilitate the formation of transcription complex, and enhance <b>RET</b> transcription, (iii) expression of <b>RET</b> was mediated by a complex regulatory network of transcription factors functioning in a synergistic, additive and/or independent manners.

40|$|The glial cell line-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) {{are critical for}} nervous system development and maintenance. GFLs promote survival and growth via activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) <b>Ret.</b> In sympathetic neurons, the duration of <b>Ret</b> signaling is governed by how rapidly <b>Ret</b> is degraded after its activation. In an effort to elucidate mechanisms that control the half-life of <b>Ret,</b> we have identified two novel <b>Ret</b> interactors, CD 2 -associated protein (CD 2 AP) and Cbl- 3. CD 2 AP, an adaptor molecule involved in the internalization of ubiquitinated RTKs, is associated with <b>Ret</b> under basal, unstimulated conditions in neurons. After <b>Ret</b> activation by GDNF, CD 2 AP dissociates. Similarly, the E 3 -ligase Cbl- 3 interacts with unphosphorylated <b>Ret</b> and dissociates from <b>Ret</b> after <b>Ret</b> activation. In contrast to their dissociation from autophosphorylated <b>Ret,</b> an interaction between CD 2 AP and Cbl- 3 is induced by GDNF stimulation of sympathetic neurons, suggesting that CD 2 AP and Cbl- 3 dissociate from <b>Ret</b> as a complex. In neurons, the overexpression of CD 2 AP enhances the degradation of <b>Ret</b> and inhibits GDNF-dependent survival, and gene silencing of CD 2 AP blocks <b>Ret</b> degradation and promotes GDNF-mediated survival. Surprisingly, Cbl- 3 overexpression dramatically stabilizes activated <b>Ret</b> and enhances neuronal survival, even though Cbl-family E 3 ligases normally function to trigger RTK downregulation. In combination with CD 2 AP, however, Cbl- 3 promotes <b>Ret</b> degradation rapidly and almost completely blocks survival promotion by GDNF, suggesting that Cbl- 3 acts as a switch that is triggered by CD 2 AP and oscillates between inhibition and promotion of <b>Ret</b> degradation. Consistent with the hypothesis, Cbl- 3 silencing in neurons only inhibited <b>Ret</b> degradation and enhanced neuronal survival in combination with CD 2 A...|$|R

We identify key sequences that are required for <b>RET</b> 249. 8 and <b>RET</b> 132. 8 E 2 responsiveness, including motifs known to be bound by ESR 1, FOXA 1 and TFAP 2 C.
