40|$|Abstract. “Castellated beam ” {{is a name}} {{commonly}} used for type of expanded beam. Castellated beams combine beauty, versatility, economy in steel design. These are fabricated from standard <b>rolled</b> <b>section</b> and are engineered to save time of construction, enabling saving in steel and reducing building costs. These are mainly designed to reduce weight {{and at the same}} time increase the efficiency in structural performance. The principal advantage of castellation is the increase in vertical bending stiffness castellated beams have proved to be efficient for moderately loaded longer spans where the Design is controlled by moment capacity or deflection. In this paper a steel beam is selected and Finite Element Analysis is done for constant loading and support condition by using ANSYS software. The deflection pattern at the center of castellated beam is studied for different parametric conditions by changing depth of hexagon to the depth of web ratio and also by changing the position of hexagon along the length of the beam. A comparison is done for various conditions...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{development}} of a new automotive bumper beam, a complete simulation of the entire forming process was carried out using LS-DYNA. The material for the beam was an ultra high strength steel presenting many challenges for the forming process. The sequence of forming operations was roll-forming (including forming a sweep in the initially straight roll-formed section), local annealing, forming of an initiator in the wall of the section and then crushing the end of the previously <b>rolled</b> <b>section.</b> The forming results (geometry, thinning and work hardening) were all transferred to the simulation of the bumper performance under various impact conditions. The paper describes {{the development}} of certain novel simulation techniques, particularly for the roll-forming for which the implicit analysis options of LS-DYNA were used, representation of the annealing process, as well as the method in which data was transferred between the various simulations. Above all, we describe how the simulations were used to guide the design of the bumper beam system up to the point of prototype manufacture and test. Keywords...|$|E

The use of partial strength or semi-rigid connections has been encouraged by codes and studies on the matter known as semi-continuous construction have proven that substantial savings in steel weight of the overall construction. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop a series of standardized partial strength connections tables of flush end-plate connections and extended end plate for unbraced steel frames with the use of trapezoidal web profiled steel (TWP) sections. The range of standard connections presented in tabulated form is limited to fourteen tables comprised of different geometrical aspects of the connections. The moment capacity, shear capacity, geometrical aspects of the connections, the size of beams, and columns that are suitable with the connections are included in the standardized tables. A method proposed by Steel Construction Institute(SCI) which take into account the requirements in Eurocode 3 and BS 5950 : 2000 Part 1 were adopted to predict the moment capacity and shear capacity in developing the tables.

This model gives a relationship between web tension output and torque input. Futhermore this relationship is expressed in transfer function form.

Composite members are widely used in structural systems to achieve additional rigidity. R. C. C. members with conventional Torsteel reinforcement may now be replaced by composite members with <b>rolled</b> steel <b>sections</b> like angle sections, galvanized iron pipe sections. Experimentally as well as analytically these members prove to be a better alternative to conventional members and are more advantageous especially at the beam-column junction and in high rise earthquake-resistant structures. The present paper aims at studying the effect of change in grade of concrete on the behavior of composite members. Beams and columns using <b>rolled</b> steel <b>sections</b> as reinforcement were cast using varying grades of concrete and tested.
