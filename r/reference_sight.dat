40|$|AIM—To {{recognise}} automatically {{the main}} components of the fundus on digital colour images.  METHODS—The main features of a fundus retinal image were defined as the optic disc, fovea, and blood vessels. Methods are described for their automatic recognition and location. 112  retinal images were preprocessed via adaptive, local, contrast enhancement. The optic discs were located by identifying the area with the highest variation in intensity of adjacent pixels. Blood vessels were identified by means of a multilayer perceptron neural net, for which the inputs were derived from a principal component analysis (PCA) of the image and edge detection of the first component of PCA. The foveas were identified using matching correlation together with characteristics typical of a fovea—for example, darkest area in the neighbourhood of the optic disc. The main components of the image were identified by an experienced ophthalmologist for comparison with computerised methods.  RESULTS—The sensitivity and specificity of the recognition of each retinal main component was as follows: 99. 1 % and 99. 1 % for the optic disc; 83. 3 % and 91. 0 % for blood vessels; 80. 4 % and 99. 1 % for the fovea.  CONCLUSIONS—In this study the optic disc, blood vessels, and fovea were accurately detected. The identification of the normal components of the retinal image will aid the future detection of diseases in these regions. In diabetic retinopathy, for example, an image could be analysed for retinopathy with <b>reference</b> to <b>sight</b> threatening complications such as disc neovascularisation, vascular changes, or foveal exudation. ...|$|R

Includes bibliographical <b>references.</b> Stopping <b>sight</b> distance (SSD) design values are a major influence in the geometric design of horizontal and vertical alignment. The current SSD equation, developed by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in 1940, incorporates two components into geometric design, a perception-response time (PRT) component and a braking distance component. Because of the importance of sight distance on highways, previous research has questioned the assumptions of these two components, specifically whether the equation accurately reflects driver and vehicle behaviors during a braking maneuver. This research evaluated the two components of the SSD equation. Four field studies were conducted that evaluated driver braking performance to an unexpected object, as well as for expected object conditions, to better quantify perception response times, braking distances, and deceleration characteristics for these two conditions. The effects of pavement conditions and different geometry sections, as well as the effects of antilock brakes, were also evaluated. Results of the research indicated that nearly all drivers can respond faster than the 2. 5 second factor in the AASHTO perception-response time component. Furthermore, the results indicated that nearly all drivers can perform a braking maneuver, on wet and dry pavements, in a shorter distance than the derived value of the AASHTO braking distance component. The results of the research also indicated that drivers do not perform locked-wheel braking maneuvers, but rather, controlledtype maneuvers by modulating the pressure applied to the brake pedal...|$|R

Includes bibliographical <b>references.</b> Stopping <b>sight</b> distance is an important parameter used in the design of a roadway's horizontal and vertical alignment. Many of the parameters used in the current stopping sight distance equation were developed in the 1950 s and may not accurately reflect the driver and vehicle population currently on the transportation network. An accident causation study was conducted to determine if roadways with limited stopping sight distance present a safety hazard for the transportation network. Rural two-lane and multilane roadways with limited sight distance crest vertical curves were identified in three states, and accident narratives for the most recent three to five years were obtained for the selected roadways. After analyzing the accident narratives, it was determined that only 18 of the 439 accident narratives evaluated had limited stopping sight distance, during the daytime or nighttime, as a possible contributing factor. Ten of the 18 accidents with limited stopping sight distance as a contributing factor were caused by a vehicle striking another vehicle. There has been a concern that roadways with limited stopping sight distance present a significant problem for the older driver as well as large trucks. The percentage of older drivers on the selected two-lane and multilane study sites with limited stopping sight distance was similar to the percentage of older drivers in all accidents, reported by the National Safety Council. Only 30 of the accident narratives evaluated were large truck accidents. In addition, only one of the large trucks was involved in an accident with stopping sight distance as a possible contributing factor. Older drivers and large trucks {{did not appear to be}} overrepresented in accidents on roadways with limited stopping sight distance. All the accidents with limited stopping sight distance as a contributing factor occurred on vertical curves with a K value less than 125, which corresponds to 400 feet of stopping sight distance.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effect of}} a random magnetic field on Zeeman line transfer, assuming that the scales of fluctuations of the random field are much smaller than photon mean free paths associated to the line formation (micro-turbulent limit). The mean absorption and anomalous dispersion coefficients are calculated for random fields with a given mean value, isotropic or anisotropic Gaussian distributions azimuthally invariant about the direction of the mean field. Following Domke & Pavlov (1979, Ap&SS, 66, 47), the averaging process is carried out in a reference frame defined by the direction of the mean field. The main steps are described in detail. They involve the writing of the Zeeman matrix in the polarization matrix representation of the radiation field and a rotation of the line of <b>sight</b> <b>reference</b> frame. Three types of fluctuations are considered : fluctuations along the direction of the mean field, fluctuations perpendicular to the mean field, and isotropic fluctuations. In each case, the averaging method is described in detail and fairly explicit expressions for the mean coefficients are established, most of which were given in Dolginov & Pavlov (1972, Soviet Ast., 16, 450) or Domke & Pavlov (1979, Ap&SS, 66, 47). They include {{the effect of a}} microturbulent velocity field with zero mean and a Gaussian distribution. A detailed numerical investigation of the mean coefficients illustrates the two effects of magnetic field fluctuations: broadening of the σ-components by fluctuations of the magnetic field intensity, leaving the π-components unchanged, and averaging over the angular dependence of the π and σ components. For longitudinal fluctuations only the first effect is at play. For isotropic and perpendicular fluctuations, angular averaging can modify the frequency profiles of the mean coefficients quite drastically with the appearance of an unpolarized central component in the diagonal absorption coefficient, even when the mean field is in direction of the line of sight. A detailed comparison {{of the effects of the}} three types of fluctuation coefficients is performed. In general the magnetic field fluctuations induce a broadening of the absorption and anomalous dispersion coefficients together with a decrease of their values. Two different regimes can be distinguished depending on whether the broadening is larger or smaller than the Zeeman shift by the mean magnetic field. For isotropic fluctuations, the mean coefficients can be expressed in terms of generalized Voigt and Faraday-Voigt functions H^(n) and F^(n) introduced by Dolginov & Pavlov (1972, Soviet Ast., 16, 450). These functions are related to the derivatives of the Voigt and Faraday-Voigt functions. A recursion relation is given in an Appendix for their calculation. A detailed analysis is carried out of the dependence of the mean coefficients on the intensity and direction of the mean magnetic field, on its root mean square fluctuations and on the Landé factor and damping parameter of the line...|$|R
40|$|The {{push for}} {{educational}} {{reform in the}} province of Quebec, Canada has brought to the foreground many ideas about {{what needs to be done}} to improve the learning experience of students. While there has been some movement in the primary grade levels, change in the secondary level is still in its infancy. There are some teachers, however, in high schools who have been on the cutting edge of educational reform. The purpose of this study is to look at participation within a secondary classroom where the philosophy of the reform is being acted upon. The study, qualitative in design, is a type of ethnographic investigation of a teacher and students in a Grade VII language arts classroom. The classroom is a part of an exclusive program, namely the Alternative Learning Program, nested in a public high school in the Montreal area. Using various means of data collection such as field notes and interviews, the researcher examines the various dimensions of participation as it unfolds in this particular classroom. The researcher identifies these dimensions as assigned and shared participation. The data suggests that dynamics beyond assigned and shared participation are also evident. The dynamics, identified as participative tone, contribute to student views of the uniqueness of this particular learning environment. To present a trustworthy description of what is observed, however, the investigator shows situations in which participation is not apparent. These situations are identified as participative resistance. The researcher deduces that participation and participative resistance need to be viewed as context-bound and are, in many respects, points on a continuum. Attempts have been made in the research to allow the study participants to express their views. Through interviews, students share in their own words what participation means to them. Their words add depth to understanding of what student participation is. The study suggests that notions of the child-centered or student-centered classroom, while commendable, are not necessarily an aspiration to strive for. The study affirms that the teacher plays a key position in the classroom environment. The study begins by showing the various roles that the teacher assumes in her daily practice. Views of the teacher are presented along with perceptions of the students and the researcher to determine the various roles played out in this site. The study concludes that the teacher conducts her practice by exceeding the boundaries of her roles so identified. The study shows that the classroom does not stand in isolation, but is subject to various influences from the school, as well as the community at large. The researcher identifies these influences as context and conditions using another site as a point of <b>reference.</b> The secondary <b>sight</b> brings clarity to what the researcher observes. The researcher concludes that in addition to communal influences, learning in the primary site takes place under the banner of what is defined as an arts-oriented curriculum.

In spite of the teacher's good intentions, tensions sometimes foster a competitive rather than collaborative spirit among the students...|$|R
