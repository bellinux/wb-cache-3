5|$|A mutant who has {{a healing}} ability like Wolverine's, and is {{controlled}} by Stryker. She wields long <b>retractable</b> adamantium fingernails. Only her first name is mentioned in dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Block 2: {{infantry}} {{block with}} one <b>retractable</b> mixed-arms turret, one AM cloche, one GFM-B cloche and one GFM-B observation cloche. Block 2 {{was the principal}} focus of the German assault.|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A320 {{family are}} narrow-body (single-aisle) {{aircraft}} with a <b>retractable</b> {{tricycle landing gear}} and are powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. The Airbus A320 family is the only narrow-body aircraft from Airbus.|$|E
5|$|The paws of the cheetah are {{narrower}} {{than those}} of other felids. The slightly curved claws lack a protective sheath and are weakly <b>retractable</b> (semi-retractable). This is a major point of difference between the cheetah and the big cats, which have fully <b>retractable</b> claws, and a similarity to canids. Additionally, the claws of the cheetah are shorter as well as straighter {{than those of}} other cats. Absence of protection makes the claws blunt; however, the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp.|$|E
5|$|The sensors of the {{starship}} U.S.S. Enterprise {{pick up a}} strange alien spacecraft following it in hot pursuit. Mr. Spock, played by Chevy Chase, identifies it as a 1968 Chrysler Imperial with a tinted windshield and <b>retractable</b> headlights.|$|E
5|$|A train may {{occasionally}} {{experience a}} rollback following a launch. A rollback {{occurs when the}} train fails to make it {{over the top of}} the tower and descends back down the side it was launched. Kingda Ka includes <b>retractable</b> magnetic brakes on its launch track to prevent a train from rolling back into the loading station.|$|E
5|$|AMiBA was {{initially}} configured as a 7-element interferometer, using 0.576m Cassegrain dishes {{mounted on a}} 6m carbon fibre hexapod mount. It is located on Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and observes at 3mm (86–102GHz) to minimize foreground emission from other, non-thermal sources. The telescope has a <b>retractable</b> shelter, made from seven steel trusses and PVC fabric.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, {{plans were}} drawn up {{to move to}} a 55,000-seat {{purpose-built}} arena {{on the site of the}} King's Dock in Liverpool. The proposed stadium would have had a <b>retractable</b> roof enabling it to be used for concerts and chairman Bill Kenwright had hoped to have it ready for the 2005–06 season.|$|E
5|$|Originally, a {{redevelopment}} of Nadderud was proposed, but in 1999 Stabæk players {{launched the}} idea of building a new stadium at Fornebu, which became subject to an urban redevelopment project after the 1998 closing of Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The initial proposal was named Blue Dream Arena, would have seating for 25,000 spectators, blue artificial turf and a <b>retractable</b> roof. Other proposed amenities were movable seating which would also allow the stadium to both host athletics and be configured as an intimate football stadium. The idea called for Bruce Springsteen to hold a concert before the first match, which would be played against Barcelona. Several of the initial concepts of the stadium were never materialized. International rules disallowed blue artificial turf; instead, the flooring in the boxes were made in a blue, artificial turf-inspired material. Also {{the idea of}} having a <b>retractable</b> roof was discarded, both because of technical difficulties and cost issues.|$|E
5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) {{launch vehicle}} was {{planned to be}} implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5. However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with <b>retractable</b> wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{companies}} which provided tie-in merchandising were 7-Eleven, Papa John's Pizza, and Schick. Hugh Jackman also posed as Wolverine for the Got Milk? campaign. In February 2009, Hasbro released a , featuring action figures and a glove with <b>retractable</b> claws. In April, Marvel debuted a new comic series, , which writer Jason Aaron {{said that while}} not directly influenced by the film, was written considering people who would get interested in Wolverine comics after watching the film.|$|E
5|$|Both Edmundston and Rimouski were {{fitted with}} about 60 light projectors: {{those on the}} hull were on <b>retractable</b> supports; those on the {{superstructure}} were on fixed supports. Each ship's diffused lighting system was tested systematically in St Margaret's Bay, and then trialled when actually escorting Atlantic convoys in 1943. Experimentally, the diffused lighting reduced the ships' visibility by up to 70%, but at sea the electrical equipment proved too delicate, and frequently malfunctioned. Worse, the system was slow to respond to changes in background lighting, and the Canadian Navy considered the lighting too green.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the test programme, Senior Prom was {{cancelled}} in 1982; reportedly one reason for the cancellation of the project was that the size and configuration of the Senior Prom aircraft rendered it incapable of being carried in internal weapons bays such as that on the B-1 bomber; the AGM-129 ACM, a competing design to Senior Prom for the cruise missile requirement, had a more slender airframe with <b>retractable</b> wings, which rendered it capable of internal carriage; it began flight testing shortly {{after the end of the}} Senior Prom programme.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, NFF {{launched}} {{plans for}} a redevelopment of Ullevaal, including artificial turf, a <b>retractable</b> roof and redevelopment of the West Stand to increase total capacity to 30,500 spectators. The combination of the three would allow Ullevaal to become a multi-purpose venue and allow more matches to be played, grant the teams more practice time on their home pitch, make room for sponsor events, allow more concerts and potentially allow non-football sports, such as sprint skiing, to be held.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012, TFC played its first-ever {{match in}} the Rogers Centre, the 49,982-capacity home of Major League Baseball's Toronto Blue Jays and former {{home of the}} Argonauts, hosting the LA Galaxy in the home leg of the 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League Championship Round. The <b>retractable</b> roof stadium was also the venue for a {{friendly}} against Liverpool of the English Premier League in July of that year.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the stadium is the head office of many sports federations, a bandy field, and commercial property including a conference center, hotel and shopping mall. The stadium is located adjacent to Ullevål Stadion Station of the Oslo Metro and the Ring 3 motorway. Plans call to replace the West Stand to increase capacity to 30,000 and perhaps add a <b>retractable</b> roof and artificial turf.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{aviation}} design teams worldwide started {{developing a}} new generation of all-metal, low-wing fighter aircraft. The French Dewoitine D.520 and Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 109, for example, were designed to take advantage of new techniques of monocoque construction and the availability of new high-powered, liquid-cooled, in-line aero engines. They also featured refinements such as <b>retractable</b> undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, low drag and all-metal wings (all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow to be adopted by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability).|$|E
5|$|Kraken Unleashed {{operates}} {{with three}} floorless trains. Each train seats 32 riders in eight rows of four. This gives the ride a theoretical hourly capacity of 1500 riders per hour. The open-air trains feature seats which leave riders' legs dangling above the track. Riders are restrained with over-the-shoulder restraints (OTSRs). As the trains are floorless, the station has a <b>retractable</b> floor for safe boarding.|$|E
5|$|Kuhnke assumed {{command of}} the 33rd U-boat Flotilla upon {{arriving}} at Flensburg. He relinquished command of U-853 back to Frömsdorf, who took the U-boat on her third and final patrol. Before departure U-853 was fitted with a Schnorchel, a <b>retractable</b> air intake and exhaust that allowed the ship to remain submerged while running her diesel engines. The Schnorchel reduced the need to spend dangerous periods on the surface recharging batteries.|$|E
5|$|Landing the {{aircraft}} required {{the extension of}} the <b>retractable</b> landing skid and the deployment of a braking drogue parachute. As pilots could access the plane only from a hatch above the cockpit, the pilot would have to enter the E.381 before it could be attached to the carrier Ar 234C and had no way to escape in case of an emergency, while attached to the carrier.|$|E
5|$|Later {{production}} Tu-144 versions {{were more}} refined and competitive. They had <b>retractable</b> canards for better low-speed control, turbojet engines providing nearly the fuel efficiency {{and range of}} Concorde and {{a top speed of}} Mach 2.35. Passenger service commenced in November 1977, but after the 1978 crash the aircraft was taken out of service. The aircraft had an inherently unsafe structural design as a consequence of an automated production method chosen to simplify and speed up manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|Murray won for {{the first}} time on grass at Queen's and became the first British winner of the tournament since 1938. In the final Murray {{defeated}} American James Blake. At Wimbledon, against Stanislas Wawrinka, Murray's fourth round match was the first match to be played entirely under Wimbledon's <b>retractable</b> roof, also enabling it to be the latest finishing match ever at Wimbledon. However Murray lost a tight semifinal to Andy Roddick.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November 2008, Chelsea Football Club were {{reported}} to be considered moving to a new purpose built stadium at the power station. The proposed stadium was to hold between 65,000 and 75,000 fans and feature a <b>retractable</b> roof. The proposals were designed by HOK Sport, the same company who designed Wembley Stadium. However, the Chelsea FC scheme was seriously in doubt due to concerns {{for the preservation of}} the site and the collapse of the REO scheme in late November 2011.|$|E
5|$|Royal New Zealand Air Force 757 Combi – the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) {{operates}} two 757s {{converted to}} 757-200M standard by ST Aerospace Services for delivering equipment, medical evacuation, troop movements, and VIP transport. A cargo door, upgraded auxiliary power unit, enhanced communications systems, and <b>retractable</b> airstairs are fitted. The two aircraft, which replaced two 727-100QCs, have carried the Prime Minister of New Zealand, {{as well as}} flown to the ice-covered Pegasus Field near New Zealand's Scott Base in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Superman: Krypton Coaster {{operates}} {{with three}} floorless trains. Each train seats 32 riders in eight rows of four. This gives the ride a theoretical hourly capacity of 1600 riders per hour. The open-air trains feature seats which leave riders' legs dangling above the track. Riders are restrainted with over-the-shoulder restraints (OTSRs). As the trains are floorless, the station has a <b>retractable</b> floor for safe boarding.|$|E
5|$|The 1965 Tiger Mark I {{gained some}} {{exposure}} on American television {{as the car}} of choice for Maxwell Smart in the spoof spy series Get Smart. The Tiger {{was used for the}} first two seasons in the opening credits, in which Smart screeched to a halt outside his headquarters, and was used through the remainder of the series in several episodes. Some of the scenes featured unusual modifications such as a <b>retractable</b> James Bond-style machine gun that could not have fit under the Tiger's bonnet, so rebadged Alpine models were used instead.|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A318 {{is a small}} commercial, narrow-body (single-aisle) {{aircraft}} with a <b>retractable</b> tricycle {{landing gear}} and is powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. Two suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A318, CFM International with the CFM56-5B engine and Pratt & Whitney with the PW6000 engine. It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 Raptor is a {{fifth-generation}} fighter that {{is considered}} fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF. It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and sensor fusion in a single weapons platform. The Raptor has clipped delta wings with a reverse sweep on the rear, four empennage surfaces, and a <b>retractable</b> tricycle landing gear. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails; these surfaces also serve as speed brakes.|$|E
5|$|The all-seater stadium has the {{capacity}} for 74,500 supporters and features a <b>retractable</b> roof, only the second stadium of its type in Europe, and the largest football stadium {{in the world with}} this feature, by capacity. Additional seating is sometimes added for special events such as a rugby Test against the New Zealand All Blacks, or for the FA Cup Final. The current record attendance is set at just over 78,000, recorded at the Anthony Joshua v Carlos Takam fight, on 28 October 2017, in which Joshua successfully retained his WBA, IBF and IBO titles.|$|E
5|$|The {{capacity}} {{has changed}} frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion. Since then, {{there have been}} a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing places went away in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which forbids standing at matches in the UEFA competition), countered to some extent by expansions. The latest capacity is 81,044 spectators. A plan to add a <b>retractable</b> roof has been announced. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest of the average attendances of European football clubs, behind only Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-production}} E-0 series {{were built}} in small numbers. Fitted with Jumo 211 A-1 engines loaded with <b>retractable</b> radiators and exhaust systems. The variant could carry 1,700kg (3,748lb) of bombs, giving it a takeoff weight of 10,300kg (22,707lbs). The development team for the Jumo 211 A-1 engines managed to increase engine power to , subsequently the He 111 E-1s bomb load capacity increased to 2,000kg (4,410lb) and {{a top speed of}} 242mph (390km/h).|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} {{displays}} numerous adaptations to its marine environment. The nostrils and small ears can close. The hind feet, which provide {{most of its}} propulsion in swimming, are long, broadly flattened, and fully webbed. The fifth digit on each hind foot is longest, facilitating swimming while on its back, but making walking difficult. The tail is fairly short, thick, slightly flattened, and muscular. The front paws are short with <b>retractable</b> claws, with tough pads on the palms that enable gripping slippery prey. The bones show osteosclerosis, increasing their density to reduce buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|The second version, with blue-green filters {{over the}} projectors, was trialled {{on board the}} {{corvette}} HMCS Chambly in May 1941. This gave better results as the filters removed the reddish bias to the lamps when at low intensity (lower colour temperature). The supports too were <b>retractable,</b> so the delicate projectors could be stowed away for protection when not in use. This second version reduced Chambly's visibility by 50% in most conditions, and sometimes {{by as much as}} 75%. This was enough to justify development of a more robust version.|$|E
5|$|The stadium was {{designed}} by {{a team led by}} Bob Sheard at Lobb Sport Architecture, who later merged with HOK Sport to become Populous. The building contractor was Laing and the structural engineers were WS Atkins. Mike Otlet of WS Atkins designed the stadium's <b>retractable</b> roof. Cimolai S.p.A. from Italy fabricated and erected the 72 steel plane frames for the stands and all the 4,500 components of the roof.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the longest}} Wimbledon men's singles final in history, {{clocking}} in at four hours and forty-eight minutes. The match also featured numerous rain delays which meant the match finished in near darkness, at 21:15 BST, almost seven hours since the match started at 14:35 BST. It {{was to be the}} last Wimbledon final to be significantly affected by rain, as a <b>retractable</b> roof was being installed at Centre Court and would be in place by the 2009 Wimbledon Championships.|$|E
