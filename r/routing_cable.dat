5000|$|The train {{system is}} {{essential}} for the airport to function at its full capacity since it provides the only passenger access to Concourses B and C. In rare instances of the train system being out of service, shuttle buses have been used. While the system is highly reliable, one major system failure took place on April 26, 1998. A <b>routing</b> <b>cable</b> in the train tunnel was damaged by a loose wheel on one of the trains, cutting the entire system's power. The system was out of service for about seven hours. United Airlines, DIA's largest airline (who operates a large hub out of Concourse B), reported that about 30 percent of their flights and about 5,000 passengers were affected by the failure. [...] The day of the failure is now referred to as [...] "Black Sunday" [...] by airport personnel.|$|E

50|$|There {{was also}} a {{junction}} box called the Korg PS-3050, which was for controlling up to three Korg PS series synthesizers from one keyboard by <b>routing</b> a PS-3001 <b>cable</b> from the keyboard to the junction box and then <b>routing</b> separate <b>cables</b> from the junction box to the PS synthesizers. The other functionality the PS-3050 junction box added was that octaves could be switched on and off selectively for the PS synthesizers, effectively enabling keyboard splits.|$|R

5000|$|Stringerless {{raised floor}}s - One non-earthquake type of raised floor {{generally}} {{consists of an}} array of pedestals that provide the necessary height for <b>routing</b> <b>cables</b> and also serve to support each corner of the floor panels. With this type of floor, there {{may or may not}} be provisioning to mechanically fasten the floor panels to the pedestals. This stringerless type of system (having no mechanical attachments between the pedestal heads) provides maximum accessibility to the space under the floor. However, stringerless floors are significantly weaker than stringered raised floors in supporting lateral loads and are not recommended.|$|R

40|$|Integrating {{appliances}} in {{the home}} through a wired network often proves to be impractical: <b>routing</b> <b>cables</b> is usually difficult, changing the network structure afterward even more so, and portable devices can only be connected at fixed connection points. Wireless networks are not the answer either: batteries have to be regularly replaced or changed, and what they add to the device's size and weight might be disproportionate for smaller appliances. In Pin&Play, we explore a design space in between typical wired and wireless networks, investigating the use of surfaces to network objects that are attached to it.

40|$|The Smooth Shifters {{is a team}} {{composed}} of Alex Powers, Brandon Roy Sadiarin, George Rodriguez, and Torey Kruisheer. We are four senior mechanical engineering students at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo, California that {{are working on a}} senior design project for Specialized Bicycle Components, Inc. located in Morgan Hill, California. We will be under the advisement of Professor Sarah T. Harding of the mechanical engineering department at Cal Poly. Specialized, one of today’s leading bicycle companies, is in need of a test setup that measures brake and shifter cable drag. High performance cyclists using time trial, triathlon, and aero bikes are constantly looking for ways to have as much aerodynamic advantage as possible, paired with a low profile look on their bicycles. To address these issues, bicycle companies have started a new trend of <b>routing</b> <b>cables</b> inside of the bicycle frames, rather than running them outside the frames. Unfortunately, <b>routing</b> a <b>cable</b> through a bicycle’s frame causes additional cable drag which ultimately decreases shifting and braking performance. Specialized has requested a test setup {{that can be used to}} determine cable drag in any cable configuration prior to the fabrication of a physical prototype. The goals of this project are: To create a physical system to accurately mimic <b>cable</b> <b>routing</b> of a Specialized Tarmac bicycle frame and a comparative tool to measure the cable drag in competing systems. To create a simulation environment which allows a user to build a cable system to check performance without a physical test apparatus. A database of different routing systems and components can then be built up over time for continuous use with different frames...|$|R
50|$|For <b>routing</b> <b>cables</b> {{which are}} already {{assembled}} with connectors, split cable entry {{systems have been}} developed. The divisibility of these systems provides two advantages. The warranty on pre-terminated cables remains since the connectors don’t have to be cut and soldered again after entering the cables. The other advantage is that assembly can be done subsequently because the split cable entries are usually built around the existing lines.Most split cable entries consist of a split hard frame, made of plastic or sometimes aluminium (e.g. utilised in food industry) and one or several split sealing grommets, usually made of elastomer. The grommet matching the cable diameter is placed around the cable and fixed inside the cable entry frame. Thus allowing strain relief for the cables (in some cases according to EN 50262) as well as ingress protection of up to IP 65/66/67.|$|R
