50|$|The {{elements}} {{are given the}} correct lengths and spacings so that the radio waves radiated by the driven element and those reradiated by the parasitic elements all arrive {{at the front of}} the antenna in phase, so they superpose and add, increasing signal strength in the forward direction. In other words, the crest of the forward wave from the <b>reflector</b> <b>element</b> reaches the driven element just as the crest of the wave is emitted from that element. These waves reach the first director element just as the crest of the wave is emitted from that element, and so on. The waves in the reverse direction interfere destructively, cancelling out, so the signal strength radiated in the reverse direction is small. Thus the antenna radiates a unidirectional beam of radio waves from the front (director end) of the antenna.|$|E

In this technique, the <b>reflector</b> <b>element</b> is loaded with mu-negative (MNG) metamaterial unit cells to excite a mu-zero resonance (MZR), which is independent {{of the size of the}} antenna. Thus, the antenna can operate at lower frequencies without the need to increase its physical size. To implement the proposed idea, the reflector, which acts as the host transmission line, is positioned at a close distance to the driven element, which is typically a dipole antenna. To validate the proposed technique, two design concepts based on coplanar and broadside-coupled strip configurations are presented, and a wideband Yagi antenna is presented.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to determine the 3 -D topography and lateral continuity of seismic interfaces using 2 -D-derived controlled-source seismic reflector data. The aim of the approach is to give the simplest possible structure consistent with all reflector data and error estimates. We define simplicity of seismic interfaces by the degree of interface continuity (i. e. shortest length of offsets) and by the degree of interface roughness (least surface roughness). The method is applied to structural information of the crust—mantle boundary (Moho) obtained from over 250 controlled-source seismic reflection and refraction profiles in the greater Alpine region. The reflected and refracted phases from the Moho interface and their interpretation regarding crustal thickness are reviewed and their reliability weighted. Weights assigned to each <b>reflector</b> <b>element</b> are transformed to depth errors considering Fresnel volumes. The 2 -D-derived reflector elements are relocated in space (3 -D migration) and interpolation is performed between the observed reflector elements to obtain continuity of model parameters. Interface offsets are introduced only where required according to the principle of simplicity. The resulting 3 -D model of the Alpine crust—mantle boundary shows two offsets that divide the interface into a European, an Adriatic and a Ligurian Moho, with the European Moho subducting below the Adriatic Moho, and with the Adriatic Moho underthrusting the Ligurian Moho. Each sub-interface depicts the smoothest possible (i. e. simplest) surface, fitting the reflector data within their assigned errors. The results are consistent with previous studies for those regions with dense and reliable controlled-source seismic data.

40|$|The {{increasing}} interest in non-fossil fuel based electricity generation {{has caused a}} prominent boost for the renewable energy sector, especially the field of Photovoltaics (PV) {{with one of the}} main reasons being the decrease in cost of PV electricity generation. However, over the last few years a saturation in the efficiency of solar cells have been reached leading into a renewed search for other means to further reduce the cost of electricity generation from photovoltaic sources. One of the technologies that has attracted a lot of attention is low concentration photovoltaics (LCPV). LCPV investigates an alternative strategy to replace costly semiconductor material with relatively cheap optical materials by developing a Low Concentration Photovoltaic (LCPV) module. A LCPV module is divided into three subsystems, namely, the optical, electrical and thermal subsystem. This study focussed on the design, construction and characterisation of an optical subsystem accompanied by a thorough investigation into the design of an electrical subsystem. A facetted parabolic concentrator using a vertical receiver was modelled and a first prototype was constructed having a geometric concentration factor of 6. 00 X. Upon electrical characterisation of this first vertical receiver LCPV prototype a concentration of only 4. 53 X (receiver 1) and 4. 71 X (receiver 2) was obtained. The first vertical receiver LCPV prototype did not reach the expected concentration factor due to optical losses and misalignment of optical elements. The illumination profile obtained from the <b>reflector</b> <b>element</b> was investigated and an undesirable non-uniform illumination profile was discovered. A second vertical receiver LCPV prototype was constructed in an attempt to improve on the first prototype, this second vertical receiver prototype had a geometrical concentration factor of 5. 80 X. The results indicated a much improved illumination profile, yet still containing a number of non-uniformities. The second vertical receiver LCPV module yielded an operational concentration factor of 5. 34 X. From the preliminary results obtained it was discovered that under concentrated illumination there was a limitation on the maximum power that could be obtained from the receiver. Upon further investigation it was discovered that this limitation was due to the higher current levels under concentrated illumination accompanied by a high series resistance of the receiver. This lead to the construction of new PV receivers, where this limitation could be minimised. 3 cell, 4 cell, 6 cell and 8 cell string configurations were constructed and used for the electrical characterisation of the prototypes. Due to non-uniformity of the illumination profile obtained from the second LCPV prototype a third vertical receiver LCPV prototype was constructed. This vertical receiver design illustrated more uniformity in the obtained illumination distribution and had a geometrical concentration factor of 4. 61 X, although under operation only 4. 26 X could be obtained. It is important to note that the geometric concentration factor does not account for reflective losses of the reflective material. One of the main reasons for the difficulty in obtaining a uniform illumination profile with the vertical receiver design is that the facetted <b>reflector</b> <b>element</b> is far away from the PV receiver. This enhances the effect of the slightest misalignment of any of the optical elements. This large distance also increases the effect of lensing from each facet. These factors lead to the consideration of a second design, which would counteract these factors. A horizontal receiver LCPV module design implementing a facetted parabolic reflector was considered to counteract these effects. From a mathematical model a horizontal receiver LCPV prototype was constructed having a geometrical concentration factor 5. 3 X. The optical characterisation of the illumination profile showed a much improved illumination profile, which was much more uniform than the previous illumination profiles obtained from the other LCPV prototypes. The uniformity of the illumination profile could be seen in results obtained from the electrical characterisation where the concentrator reached operational concentration factor of 5. 01 X. The reliability of the third vertical receiver LCPV prototype and the horizontal receiver LCPV prototype as well as the receivers were investigated by placing each receiver under stressed operational conditions for 60 sun hours. I-V characteristics were obtained after every five sun hours to investigate any signs of degradation. After 60 sun hours none of the receiver displayed any signs of degradation or reduction in electrical performanc...|$|E

The build–up of 6 Li and 3 He, that is, {{the strong}} thermal neutron {{absorbers}} or {{the so called}} "neutron poisons", in the beryllium reflector changes the physical characteristics of the reactor, such as reactivity, neutron spectra, neutron flux level, power distribution, etc.; furthermore,gaseous isotopes such as 3 H and 4 He induce swelling and embrittlement of the reflector. The SAFARI– 1 research reactor, operated by Necsa at Pelindaba in South Africa, uses a beryllium reflector on three sides of the core, consisting of 19 beryllium reflector elements in total. This MTR went critical in 1965, and the original beryllium reflectors are still used. The individual neutron irradiation history of each beryllium <b>reflector</b> <b>element,</b> {{as well as the}} impact of beryllium poisoning on reactor parameters, were never well known nor investigated before. Furthermore, in the OSCAR{ 3 code system used in predictive neutronic calculations for SAFARI– 1, beryllium reflector burn–up is not accounted for; OSCAR models the beryllium reflector as a non–burnable, 100 % pure material. As a result, the poisoning phenomenon is not accounted for. Furthermore, the criteria and hence the optimum replacement time of the reflector has never been developed. This study presents detailed calculations, using MCNP, FISPACT and the OSCAR{ 3 code system, to quantify the influence of impurities that were originally present in the fresh beryllium reflector, the beryllium reflector poisoning phenomenon, and further goes on to propose the reflector's replacement criteria based on the calculated fluence and predicted swelling. Comparisons to experimental low power flux measurements and effects of safety parameters are also established. The study concludes that, to improve the accuracy and reliability of the predictive OSCAR code calculations, beryllium re flector burn–up should undoubtedly be incorporated in the next releases of OSCAR. Based on this study, the inclusion of the beryllium reflector burn–up chains is planned for implementation in the currently tested OSCAR– 4 code system. In addition to beryllium reflector poisoning, the replacement criteria of the reflector is developed. It is however crucial that experimental measurements on the contents of 3 H and 4 He be conducted and thus swelling of the reflector be quantifed. In this way the calculated results could be verified and a sound replacement criteria be developed. In the absence of experimental measurements on the beryllium reflector, the analysis and quantifcation of the calculated results is reserved for future studies. Master...|$|E
