40|$|AbstractRationale and objectivesAlthough medical {{research}} by French <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> is encouraged, their publication productivity remains unknown. Thus, we aimed {{to assess and}} analyze the publication rate of medical theses and the overall academic productivity of <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> who graduated in 2009 and 2010. Materials and methodsThe list of <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> and imaging theses {{were obtained from the}} French internet database of university theses. The main characteristics of the theses were recorded and correlated with associated publications identified by scanning the PubMed database. All other publications by French <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> not related to the theses were also obtained, described and compared to published theses. ResultsSeventy-nine out of 224 (35. 3 %) medical theses written by French <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> in 2009 and 2010 were transformed into articles published in Medline-indexed journals. Residents were first authors in 69 % (60 / 87) of these articles. The factors associated with publication of the thesis were a prospective design (P= 0. 01) and the publication as a first author of an original study not related to the thesis (P= 0. 01). Seventy-one percent of the residents had published at least one other article, including 36. 6 % as first authors.

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} {{the awareness of}} radiation protection issues and the knowledge of dose levels of imaging procedures among medical students, <b>radiology</b> <b>residents,</b> and radiography students at an academic hospital. Material and methods A total of 159 young doctors and students (including 60 <b>radiology</b> <b>residents,</b> 56 medical students, and 43 radiography students) were issued a questionnaire consisting of 16 multiple choice questions divided into three separated sections (i. e., demographic data, awareness about radiation protection issues, and knowledge about radiation dose levels of common radiological examinations). Results Medical students claimed {{to have at least}} a good knowledge of radiation protection issues more frequently than <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> and radiography students (94. 4 % vs 55 % and 35. 7 %, respectively; P < 0. 05), with no cases of perceived excellent knowledge among radiography students. However, the actual knowledge of essential radiation protection topics such as regulations, patient and tissue susceptibility to radiation damage, professional radiation risk and dose optimisation, as well as of radiation doses delivered by common radiological procedures was significantly worse among medical students than <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> and radiography students (P < 0. 05). Those latter significantly outperformed <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> as to knowledge of radiation protection issues (P < 0. 01). Overall, less than 50 % of survey respondents correctly answered all questions of the survey. Conclusions <b>Radiology</b> <b>residents,</b> radiography students and medical students have a limited awareness about radiation protection, with a specific gap of knowledge concerning real radiation doses of daily radiological examinations. Both undergraduate and postgraduate teaching needs to be effectively implemented with radiation safety courses...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies {{have looked}} at the {{accuracy}} of radiologic inter-pretations by <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> as compared with staff radiologists with regard to emergency room plain films, emergency room body CT scans, and trauma head CT scans; however, to our knowledge, no study has evaluated on-call resident interpretations of all types of neuro-radiologic CT scans. Both as a part of our departmental quality control program and to address concerns of clinical services about misinterpretation of neuroradiologic CT scans by on-call <b>radiology</b> <b>residents,</b> we evaluated the frequency of incorrect preliminary interpretations of neuroradiologic CT scans by on-call <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> and the effect of such misinterpreta-tions on clinical management and patient outcome. METHODS: As determined by the staff neuroradiologist the next day, all potentially clini-cally significant changes to preliminary reports of emergency neuroradiologic CT scans ren-dered by on-call <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> were recorded over a 9 -month period.

40|$|Purpose: Ultrasound {{training}} for the surgical residents is not a common practice in India. This study was undertaken to prepare a working model for surgical trainees and assess its effectiveness by training a single surgical resident. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study of 238 patients with pain abdomen. Training was given in abdominal ultrasound {{for a period of}} 2 months. Ultrasound scans were performed independently by a <b>radiology</b> <b>resident</b> and surgery resident. Inter-rater agreement between both residents was assessed using Kappa coefficient. Ultrasound results were compared with clinical diagnosis and final diagnosis. Results: The kappa agreement was 0. 53, 0. 56, 0. 8 and 1 for urolithiasis, appendicitis, pancreatitis and urinary tract infection, respectively. Almost all cases of cholelithiasis were identified by the surgery resident. There was improvement of 21 %, 31 % and 100 % in patients of urolithiasis, acute appendicitis and liver abscess, respectively, in the second 10 months of the study.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging {{has limited}} spatial res-olution, {{especially}} in the z direction. We decreased the section thickness of DW imaging to 3 mm to determine if this change improves the depiction of small infarcts and if it affects stroke diagnosis. METHODS: We studied conventional (5 -mm section thickness, 1 -mm intersection gap) and thin-section (3 -mm section thickness, no intersection gap) DW imaging data in 49 patients with symptoms of acute cerebral ischemia. Two radiologists who {{were not aware of}} the clinical findings reviewed all images and diagnosed the stroke subtype according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) method. Accuracies of stroke diagnosis with an experienced neuroradiologist and with a second-year <b>radiology</b> <b>resident</b> were compared. To quantify lesion conspicuity, contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were measured.

30|$|Interruptions {{have been}} {{identified}} as a prevalent and potentially harmful occurrence in radiology reading rooms. A recent workflow analysis found that radiologists are interrupted once every 12.1 min on average during regular business hours (Ratwani, Wang, Fong, & Cooper, 2016). These interruptions are primarily in the form of medical questions during in-person or phone-call interactions. During after-hours radiology, interruptions may be even more common. At many academic institutions, after-hours phone calls are handled by a single <b>radiology</b> <b>resident</b> (Balint et al., 2014). A recent study found that on-call radiologists receive an average of 72 phone calls during a typical 12 -h overnight shift (Yu, Kansagra, & Mongan, 2014). This rate of interruption equates to a 59 % chance of being interrupted by a phone call for every 10 min spent reading a computed tomography (CT) scan. In a separate analysis of after-hours reading environments, increases in phone-call volume were associated with {{an increase in the number}} of errors made by radiology residents (Balint et al., 2014). Similarly, interruptions have been linked to medical errors in other tasks, such as dispensing medication (Westbrook, Woods, Rob, Dunsmuir, & Day, 2010).|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2 ̆ 2 disk 2 ̆ 2 (ie, target) identification study was conducted to compare planar and reconstruction methods. Projective data using a composite phantom with circular disks were acquired in both planar and tomographic modes by using a full-field, digital mammographic system. Two-dimensional projections were reconstructed with both linear (ie, backprojection) and nonlinear (ie, maximization and minimization) tuned-aperture computed tomographic (TACT) methods to produce three-dimensional data sets. Four board-certified radiologists and one 4 th-year <b>radiology</b> <b>resident</b> participated as observers. All images were compared by these observers in terms of the number of disks identified. RESULTS: Significant differences (P 3 ̆c. 05, Bonferroni adjusted) were observed between all reconstruction and planar methods.

40|$|Objective: We {{wanted to}} prospectively {{evaluate}} the interobserver agreement between <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> and expert radiologists for interpreting CT images {{for making the}} diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). Materials and Methods: We assessed 112 consecutive patients, from April 2007 to August 2007, who were referred for combined CT pulmonary angiography and indirect CT venography for clinically suspected acute PE. CT scanning was performed with a 64 × 0. 5 collimation multi-detector CT scanner. The CT studies were initially interpreted by the <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> alone and then the CT images were subsequently interpreted by a consensus of the resident plus an experienced general radiologist and an experienced chest radiologist. Results: Two of the 112 CTs were unable to be interpreted (1. 7 %). Pulmonary artery clots were seen on 36 of the thoracic CT angiographies (32 %). The interobserver agreement between the <b>radiology</b> <b>residents</b> and the consensus interpretation was good (a kappa index of 0. 73). All of the disagreements (15 cases) were instances of overcall by the resident on the initial interpretation. Deep venous thrombosis was detected in 72 % (26 of 36) of the patients who had PE seen on thoracic CT. The initial and consensus interpretations of the CT venography images disagreed for two cases (kappa statistic: 0. 96). Conclusion: It does not seem adequate to base the final long-term treatment of PE on only the resident’s reading, as false positives occurred in 13 % of such cases. Timely interpretation of the CT pulmonary angiography and CT venography images should be performed by experienced radiologists for the patients with suspected PE...|$|R
