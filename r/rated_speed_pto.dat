40|$|The {{optimization}} {{process for}} generators are often done for <b>rated</b> <b>speeds</b> and torques. This thesis will discuss and show optimization of a vertical axis {{wind turbine generator}} that has a given wind profile. Although the rated power of the turbine is at winds of about 10 m/s, the wind is mostly at 4 - 6 m/s, thus needing a generator that has high efficiencies also at lower speeds and torques. Vertical axis wind turbine does not use blade pitching as the horizontal ones do and the torque and speed characteristics are therefore a bit different. It is important that the generator has a high efficiency at lower wind speeds. Optimization with different <b>rated</b> <b>speeds</b> where therefore done to ensure that the best generator was found. The final results for the wind turbine QR 5, produced by Quiet Revolution, was a generator with <b>rated</b> <b>speed</b> of 260 rpm.

40|$|Abstract — Pitch angle {{control of}} wind turbine {{has been used}} widely to reduce torque and output power {{variation}} in high <b>rated</b> wind <b>speed</b> areas. It {{is a challenge to}} maximize available energy in the low <b>rated</b> wind <b>speed</b> areas. In this paper, a wind turbine prototype with a pitch angle control based on fuzzy logic to maximize the output power is built and demonstrated. In the varying low <b>rated</b> wind <b>speed</b> of 4 - 6 m/s, the use of fuzzy logic controller can maximize the average output power of 14. 5 watt compared to 14. 0 watt at a fixed pitch angle of the blade. Implementation of pitch angle fuzzy logic-based control to the wind turbine is suitable for the low <b>rated</b> wind <b>speed</b> areas.
