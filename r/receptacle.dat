5|$|Specifications for Mini-A and Mini-B {{plug and}} <b>receptacle.</b> Also <b>receptacle</b> that accepts both plugs for On-The-Go. These {{should not be}} {{confused}} with Micro-B plug and <b>receptacle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{connector}} {{mounted on}} the host or device is called the <b>receptacle,</b> and the connector attached to the cable is called the plug. The official USB specification documents also periodically define the term male to represent the plug, and female to represent the <b>receptacle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{the type}} species of the genus Clathrus, and {{is part of the}} group of Clathrus species known as the Laternoid series. Common {{features}} uniting this group include the vertical arms of the <b>receptacle</b> (fruit body) that are not joined together at the base, and the spongy structure of the <b>receptacle.</b> According to a molecular analysis published in 2006, out of the about 40 Phallales species used in the study, C.ruber is most closely related to Aseroe rubra, Clathrus archeri, Laternea triscapa, and Clathrus chrysomycelinus.|$|E
50|$|Cigarette <b>receptacles</b> made of molded {{materials}} are often designed {{to match their}} surroundings. Sports themes such as <b>receptacles</b> decorated with golf balls and baseballs are common; other examples include nautical <b>receptacles</b> designed to look like buoys, <b>receptacles</b> resembling trees, and <b>receptacles</b> mimicking an architectural style.|$|R
5|$|USB 3.0 {{introduced}} Type-A SuperSpeed plugs and <b>receptacles</b> {{as well as}} micro-sized Type-B SuperSpeed plugs and <b>receptacles.</b> The 3.0 <b>receptacles</b> are backward-compatible {{with the}} corresponding pre-3.0 plugs.|$|R
5|$|USB3.0 {{defines a}} new SuperSpeed {{transfer}} mode, with associated new backward compatible plugs, <b>receptacles,</b> and cables. SuperSpeed plugs and <b>receptacles</b> are {{identified with a}} distinct logo and blue inserts in standard format <b>receptacles.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Micro-AB <b>receptacle</b> {{is capable}} of {{accepting}} both Micro-A and Micro-B plugs, attached {{to any of the}} legal cables and adapters as defined in revision 1.01 of the Micro-USB specification.|$|E
5|$|When {{copulation}} takes place, {{the male}} butterfly or moth places a capsule of sperm (spermatophore) in a <b>receptacle</b> {{of the female}} (called the corpus bursae). The sperm, when released from the capsule, swims directly into or via a small tube into a special seminal <b>receptacle</b> (spermatheca), where the sperm is stored until it is released into the vagina for fertilisation during egg laying, which may occur hours, days, or months after mating. The eggs pass through the ovipore. The ovipore {{may be at the}} end of a modified ovipositor or surrounded by a pair of broad setose anal papillae.|$|E
5|$|Only {{moderate}} {{force is}} needed to insert or remove a USB cable. USB cables and small USB devices are {{held in place by}} the gripping force from the <b>receptacle</b> (without need of the screws, clips, or thumb-turns other connectors have required).|$|E
50|$|The {{connector}} pairs for barrel connectors {{are defined}} in terms of 'plugs' and 'receptacles'; <b>receptacles</b> are more commonly called 'sockets' (UK) or 'jacks' (US). <b>Receptacles</b> may be panel-mounted or circuit board-mounted. Plugs are on cables. Some 'in-line' <b>receptacles</b> are also cable-mounted.|$|R
5000|$|A {{building}} code {{example is the}} use of ungrounded ("2-prong") electrical <b>receptacles.</b> Over time, these older devices were deprecated in favor of the safer grounded ("3-prong") <b>receptacles.</b> The obsolete ungrounded <b>receptacles</b> were still permitted by [...] "grandfathering" [...] in existing electrical wiring, but became prohibited from new installations. Ungrounded <b>receptacles</b> are still available for legal purchase, but are intended solely for repairs to existing older electrical installations.|$|R
50|$|AFCI <b>receptacles</b> are an {{alternative}} solution to AFCI breakers. These <b>receptacles</b> {{are designed to}} address the dangers associated with both types of potentially hazardous arcing: parallel and series. AFCI <b>receptacles</b> offer the benefit of localized test and reset with such buttons located {{on the face of}} the device. This is very convenient and saves a journey to the breaker panel.|$|R
5|$|The type-A plug has an {{elongated}} rectangular cross-section, inserts into a type-A <b>receptacle</b> on a downstream port on a USB host or hub, and carries both power and data. Captive cables on USB devices, such as keyboards or mice, will be terminated with a type-A plug.|$|E
5|$|Type A: The plug (male) {{connector}} outside {{dimensions are}} 13.9mm × 4.45mm, and the <b>receptacle</b> (female) connector inside dimensions are 14mm × 4.55mm. There are 19 pins, with bandwidth to carry all SDTV, EDTV, HDTV, and 4K UHD modes. It is electrically compatible with single-link DVI-D.|$|E
5|$|USB On-The-Go (OTG) {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} a device performing both master and slave roles. All current OTG devices are required to have one, and only one, USB connector: a Micro-AB <b>receptacle.</b> (In the past, before the development of Micro-USB, On-The-Go devices used Mini-AB receptacles).|$|E
40|$|Judging by {{observation}} and past watershed projects, our group saw that recycling at Edgewood was not effective. We also {{noticed that the}} hallway waste <b>receptacles</b> on campus were more effective than classroom <b>receptacles.</b> Since recycling has so many benefits, we thought that making the classroom <b>receptacles</b> more similar to the hallway <b>receptacles</b> might improve the recycling on campus. Our group constructed tops for the classroom <b>receptacles</b> that reassembled the hallway <b>receptacles</b> and labeled the tops more clearly and obviously. We found that the “new/improved ” tops were effective in improving recycling on campus. We suggest some minor improvements with our experiment for further research, such as more communication with custodial staff and more extensive labeling. Recycling has both environmental benefits as well as financial benefits. Some of these environmental benefits include the conservation of energy, the reduction of pollution, decreases {{in the amount of}} global climate change, and limits the disruption to biodiversity. The retrieval of raw materials causes pollution and wastes energy, but whe...|$|R
50|$|Another common element are <b>receptacles</b> which {{receive the}} {{products}} {{as they leave}} the sorter towards a proper destination. <b>Receptacles</b> may {{be as simple as}} chutes, or gravity conveyors, or powered conveyors.|$|R
50|$|When {{there is}} only one socket in a house or apartment, the {{incoming}} line is connected to the two lower <b>receptacles</b> and the upper <b>receptacles</b> are left unused. When a subscriber has more than one telephone socket, they typically are connected so that two telephones can not be connected to the telephone exchange at the same time. This is done by connecting the two upper <b>receptacles</b> of a socket to the lower <b>receptacles</b> of the next socket. When a connected telephone's handset is lifted the two twisted pair connections are separated, thus disconnecting any telephones downward in the chain.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{other data}} buses (e.g., Ethernet, HDMI), USB {{connections}} are directed, with both {{upstream and downstream}} ports emanating from a single host. This applies to electrical power, with only downstream facing ports providing power; this topology was chosen to easily prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment. Thus, USB cables have different ends: A and B, with different physical connectors for each. Therefore, in general, each different format requires four different connectors: a plug and <b>receptacle</b> {{for each of the}} A and B ends. USB cables have the plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computers or electronic devices. In common practice, the A end is usually the standard format, and the B side varies over standard, mini, and micro. The mini and micro formats also provide for USB On-The-Go with a hermaphroditic AB <b>receptacle,</b> which accepts either an A or a B plug. On-The-Go allows USB between peers without discarding the directed topology by choosing the host at connection time; it also allows one <b>receptacle</b> to perform double duty in space-constrained applications.|$|E
5|$|A.coccinea {{closely resembles}} A.arachnoidea, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} from the latter by its bright red arms, and its larger spores (4–5 by 2.5–3μm in A.coccinea compared with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5μm in A.arachnoidea). A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra is a relatively common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its reddish <b>receptacle</b> (compared with pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.|$|E
5|$|In most species, {{the sexes}} are {{separate}} {{and there is}} little sexual dimorphism, but a few species are hermaphroditic and some parasitic forms show large differences between the sexes. Some Cymothoidans are protandrous hermaphrodites, starting life as males and later changing sex, and some Anthuroideans are the reverse, being protogynous hermaphrodites that are born female. Some Gnathiidans males are sessile and live with a group of females. Males have a pair of penises, which may be fused in some species. The sperm is transferred to the female by the modified second pleopod which receives it from the penis and which is then inserted into a female gonopore. The sperm is stored in a special <b>receptacle,</b> a swelling on the oviduct close to the gonopore. Fertilisation only takes place when the eggs are shed soon after a moult, at which time a connection is established between the semen <b>receptacle</b> and the oviduct.|$|E
40|$|Photosynthetic {{responses}} to irradiance and temperature of "leaves" and <b>receptacles</b> were compared in February (vegetative stage) and May (reproductive stage) in the seaweed, Hizikia fusiforme (Harvey) Okamura (Sargassaceae, Phaeophyta) from Nanao Island, Shantou, China. Irradiance-saturated photosynthesis (P-max) {{was significantly higher}} in <b>receptacles</b> than in "leaves" on a fresh weight basis, and that of "leaves" was greater in May than in February at ambient seawater temperatures. The optimum temperature for P-max was 30 degrees C for both "leaves" and <b>receptacles,</b> being 5 - 10 degrees C higher than the ambient seawater temperature. The apparent photosynthetic efficiencies were greater in <b>receptacles</b> than in "leaves" within the tested temperature range of 10 - 40 degrees C. The irradiance for saturating photosynthesis for both "leaves" and <b>receptacles</b> was temperature-dependent, with the highest values (about 200 mu mol photons m(- 2) s(- 1)) at 30 degrees C...|$|R
50|$|Weather-resistant (WR) <b>receptacles</b> {{are made}} of UV {{stabilized}} thermoplastic with high cold impact resistance to withstand the elements. Required by the 2008 National Electrical Code in outdoor damp or wet locations, WR <b>receptacles</b> should be installed in patio, deck, and pool areas. They are available {{in a variety of}} models including GFCI and tamper-resistant. For added protection, WR <b>receptacles</b> should be protected by Extra-Duty While In-Use or Weather-Resistant Covers. These covers are ruggedly constructed to seal out moisture (dripping or condensing), dust, debris, and insects, while providing easy access to <b>receptacles</b> to allow homeowners to use power tools, trimmers, sprinkler systems, and pumps with confidence and improved safety.|$|R
2500|$|The National Electrical Code {{has been}} updated for 2014 and it {{addresses}} {{the use of}} Outlet Branch Circuit (OBC) Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) <b>Receptacles</b> {{as an alternative to}} breakers when used for modifications/ extensions, as replacement <b>receptacles</b> or in new construction. [...] AFCI <b>Receptacles</b> work to address the dangers associated with potentially hazardous arcing conditions (parallel arcs and series arcs) by interrupting power to help prevent dangerous arc-faults that may lead to an electrical fire.|$|R
5|$|The Genesis {{represents}} Sega's {{entry into}} the 16-bit era of video game consoles. In Japan, Sega released the Mega Jet, a portable version of the Mega Drive designed for use on Japan Airlines flights. As a condensed version, the Mega Jet requires a connection to a television screen and a power source, and so outside of airline flights it is only useful in cars equipped with a television set and cigarette lighter <b>receptacle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The type-B plug has a near square {{cross-section}} {{with the}} top exterior corners beveled. As part of a removable cable, it inserts into an upstream port on a device, such as a printer. On some devices, the type-B <b>receptacle</b> has no data connections, being used solely for accepting power from the upstream device. This two-connector-type scheme (A/B) prevents a user from accidentally creating a loop.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} types of USB connector, {{including}} some that have been added while the specification progressed. The original USB specification detailed standard-A and standard-B plugs and receptacles; the B connector was necessary so that cabling could be plug ended at both ends and still prevent users from connecting one computer <b>receptacle</b> to another. The first engineering change notice to the USB2.0 specification added Mini-B plugs and receptacles.|$|E

50|$|In phycology, <b>receptacles</b> are {{structures}} at {{the ends}} of branches of algae mainly in the brown algae or Heterokontophyta in the Order Fucales. They are specialised structures which contain the reproductive organs called conceptacles. <b>Receptacles</b> also function as a structure that captures food.|$|R
40|$|Sperm {{storage is}} common in {{internally}} fertilizing animals, but is also present in several external fertilizers, such as many cephalopods. Cephalopod males attach sperm packets (spermatangia) to female conspecifics during mating. Females of eight externally fertilizing families comprising 25 % of cephalopod biodiversity have sperm-storage organs (seminal <b>receptacles)</b> in their buccal area, which are not in direct physical contact with the deposited spermatangia. The mechanism of sperm transmission between the implantation site and the storage organ has remained a major mystery in cephalopod reproductive biology. Here, jumbo squid females covering almost the entire life cycle, from immature to a laboratory spawned female, were {{used to describe the}} internal structure of the seminal <b>receptacles</b> and the process of sperm storage. Seminal fluid was present between the spermatangia and seminal <b>receptacles,</b> but absent in regions devoid of seminal <b>receptacles.</b> The sperm cellular component was formed by spermatozoa and round cells. Although spermatozoa were tracked over the buccal membrane of the females to the inner chambers of the seminal <b>receptacles,</b> round cells were not found inside the seminal <b>receptacles,</b> suggesting that spermatozoa are not sucked up by the muscular action of the seminal <b>receptacles.</b> This finding supports the hypothesis that spermatozoa are able to actively migrate over the female skin. Although further experimental support is needed to fully confirm this hypothesis, our findings shed light on the elusive process of sperm storage in many cephalopods, a process that is fundamental for understanding sexual selection in the sea...|$|R
5|$|A {{good example}} of {{convergence}} in plants is the evolution of edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the <b>receptacle</b> or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is {{the walls of the}} pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|E

Further, it is not permitted to use the flag as part of any trademark, or to produce or display any flag which bears any graphics or word superimposed on the design of the national flag. The flag or any image of it may also not be used or applied as or as part of any costume or attire.|$|E
5|$|One monk {{was thrown}} from a balcony {{down to the}} {{courtyard}} six meters below. Nhu's men vandalized the main altar and confiscated the intact charred heart of Thích Quảng Đức, which had failed to burn during his re-cremation. However, some of the Buddhists were able to flee the pagoda with a <b>receptacle</b> containing his ashes. Two monks jumped {{the back wall of}} Xá Lợi to enter the grounds of the adjoining United States Agency for International Development (USAID) mission, where they were given asylum, despite the presence of troops behind the pagoda walls who opened fire with automatic weapons on any monks who tried to flee by jumping the fence.|$|E
