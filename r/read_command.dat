25|$|A read, burst terminate, or {{precharge}} command may {{be issued}} {{at any time}} after a <b>read</b> <b>command,</b> and will interrupt the read burst after the configured CAS latency. So if a <b>read</b> <b>command</b> is issued on cycle 0, another <b>read</b> <b>command</b> is issued on cycle 2, and the CAS latency is 3, then the first <b>read</b> <b>command</b> will begin bursting data out during cycles 3 and 4, then {{the results from the}} second <b>read</b> <b>command</b> will appear beginning with cycle 5.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>read</b> <b>command</b> {{includes}} auto-precharge, the precharge {{begins the}} same cycle as the interrupting command.|$|E
25|$|M6, M5, M4: CAS latency. Generally only 010 (CL2) and 011 (CL3) are legal. Specifies {{the number}} of cycles between a <b>read</b> <b>command</b> and data output from the chip. The chip has a {{fundamental}} limit on this value in nanoseconds; during initialization, the memory controller must use its knowledge of the clock frequency to translate that limit into cycles.|$|E

25|$|Use of {{the data}} bus is {{intricate}} and thus requires a complex DRAM controller circuit. This is because data written to the DRAM must be presented in the same cycle as the write command, but reads produce output 2 or 3 cycles after the <b>read</b> <b>command.</b> The DRAM controller must ensure that the data bus is never required for a read and a write at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Pipelining {{means that}} the chip can accept a new command before it has {{finished}} processing the previous one. For a pipelined write, the write command can be immediately followed by another command without waiting for the data {{to be written into}} the memory array. For a pipelined read, the requested data appears a fixed number of clock cycles (latency) after the <b>read</b> <b>command,</b> during which additional commands can be sent.|$|E
25|$|This IPL {{concept is}} device independent. It {{is capable of}} IPL-ing from a card deck, from a {{magnetic}} tape, or from a hard disk. For this purpose, the normal X'02' command, which is simulated by the CPU, is taken to be a standard sequential <b>read</b> <b>command</b> on card and tape media (which are inherently sequential access in nature), but a special Read-IPL command on hard disks (which are inherently random access in nature; hard disks use a related, but different, read-type command, X'06', and others, for sequential, non-IPL reads).|$|E
5000|$|Deterministic Read Zero after TRIM (RZAT): All <b>read</b> <b>commands</b> to the LBA after a TRIM shall return zero.|$|R

25|$|Hard disk {{controllers}} (IBM 2844, 3830, among others, and compatibles) {{accept the}} X'02' command, but first cause a seek to cylinder X'0000', and head X'0000', and {{a search for}} record X'01', before executing the sequential <b>read</b> <b>command</b> {{as if it was}} a X'06'. Without this special hard disk controller behavior, device independent IPL would not be possible. On a hard drive, the IPL Text is contained on cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'01' (24 bytes), and cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'02' (fairly large, certainly somewhat more than 3,000 bytes). The volume label is always contained on cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'03' (80 bytes). The volume label always points to the VTOC, with a pointer of the form HHHH (that is, the VTOC must reside within the first 65,536 tracks). The VTOC's Format 4 DSCB defines the extent (size) of the VTOC, so the volume label only needs a pointer to the first track in the VTOC's extent, and as the Format 4 DSCB, which describes the VTOC, is always the very first DSCB in the VTOC, HHHH also points to the Format 4 DSCB.|$|E
2500|$|When a <b>read</b> <b>command</b> is issued, the SDRAM {{will produce}} the {{corresponding}} output {{data on the}} DQ lines {{in time for the}} rising edge of the clock a few clock cycles later, depending on the configured CAS latency. [...] Subsequent words of the burst will be produced in time for subsequent rising clock edges.|$|E
2500|$|The TIC (transfer in channel) {{will cause}} the channel program to branch to the SEARCH command until a record with a {{matching}} key (or {{the end of the}} track) is encountered. [...] When a record with a matching key is found the DASD controller will include Status Modifier in the channel status, causing the channel to skip the TIC CCW; thus the channel program will not branch and the channel will execute the <b>READ</b> <b>command.</b>|$|E
