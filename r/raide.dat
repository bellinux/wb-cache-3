5000|$|Whatever the name’s origins, it {{is clear}} that by the time of first {{documentary}} mention, the village had already existed for quite some time. In 1319, <b>Raide</b> found itself under the lordship of the Waldgraves of Kyrburg. In a 1375 partition agreement, it was named as Rode. Enfeoffment documents from 1434 referred to it as Vogtei des Hofes <b>Raide</b> (Vogtei meant a reeve’s office or responsibilities; des Hofes is genitive for der Hof, meaning “the estate”) ...|$|E

50|$|Grand Cordon of the Knights of <b>Raide.</b> Has two children; his first, named Richard {{was thought}} to be kidnapped by the Nereids. In {{actuality}} the King of <b>Raide</b> hired Lobo, the leader of Yesterwind, to kidnap Richard and give him to the Nereids as a payment for curing the Queen. Though never stated it is believed that Thorndyke became the Grand Cordon as a way to repay him. Upon discovering that Richard, now known as Penn, {{is alive and well in}} the care of the Nereids and that he enjoys living there he decides to let him stay with them. When it is brought to his attention that the King of <b>Raide</b> is in possession of a Crimson Tear, which is considered a forbidden item, he steals it from the King and presents it to the ruling council. He is then captured and killed in front of his own knights by order of the king for treason. It is his death that inspires Galahad and other knights to turn against <b>Raide</b> and rebuild the city after it is destroyed by the World Eater, Feinne. In the Demon path he attacks the Main Character along with the Nereids to save Penn and then turns himself over to ensure the safety of Penn. Kanan, who also works for the Main character in the Demon Path, finds a child that looks like Penn and forces Thorndyke to kill him. Believing he has killed his own son he goes insane and becomes a homicidal maniac for the reminder of the story.|$|E

5000|$|The name Delired Cameleon Family {{was taken}} from a humorous [...] "franglo" [...] pun, [...] "delire <b>raide</b> camé Léon". This being an English {{language}} name for a French project, it contains, perhaps unintentionally, two words that do {{not exist in the}} English language: delired as the adjective form of delirium ("delirious" [...] would have been correct), and cameleon is a misspelling of the lizard species chameleon (probably confused with the French spelling, caméléon).|$|E

5000|$|French {{writer and}} artist Benoît Morel {{was working as}} a {{designer}} at publishing house Éditions Gallimard in Paris’s Belleville quarter when he met Pierre Payan, a multi-instrumentalist who was in need of lyrics. Morel had already written lyrics for neo-realist group Les Têtes <b>Raides,</b> and discovered that he and Payan shared an interest in 'literary’ music such as the work of Georges Brassens, Léo Ferré's song interpretations of the poetry of Louis Aragon, Les Frères Jacques' performances of the poems of Jacques Prévert, and anarchist singer-songwriter Gaston Couté. The two were soon joined by Eric [...] "Fil" [...] Philippon, and began playing out in October 1990 with the release of a self-financed 10" [...] vinyl EP and as openers for Les Têtes <b>Raides.</b> By 1992 La Tordue were headlining gigs that featured a rotation of many instruments, including concertina, guitar, piano, double bass, musical saw and saucepans.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, Les animals was released. As {{with other}} Solo albums {{the sound was}} new, the lyrics {{contained}} much poetic language, and the songs were performed energetically.

Solo appeared on two tracks on the album Dans le caillou by Karpatt.|$|R

The act also provided for the appointment of a superintendent to discharge the administrative functions under the direct control and supervision of Divisional Commissioner of Chittagong. However seven years later in 1697 the post of superintendent was re-designated as that of Deputy Commissioner.|$|E
50|$|In 1263, the Waldgraviate was partitioned, {{with the}} Schmidtburg and Kyrburg going to Emich, and Dhaun and Grumbach to Gottfried. The {{so-called}} Landgraviate, however, remained undivided and in common ownership. Only nineteen years later, in 1282, came another partition {{between members of}} the house’s main line: Konrad kept Schmidtburg while Gottfried got Kyrburg and the paternal rights to Bruchweiler, Kempfeld, Breitenthal and Oberhosenbach. High jurisdiction and woodlands remained commonly held. In 1319, the communal high jurisdiction over <b>Raide</b> (Veitsrodt), Horbure (Herborn), Bruchwilre (Bruchweiler), Schuren (Schauren), Kempvelt (Kempfeld), Huisinbach (Niederhosenbach), Breidendail (Breitenthal) and three villages that have since vanished, Dudinsbach (Diedesbach), Vockinhusen (Fuckenhausen) and Dyfenbach, was documented.|$|E
5000|$|Soul Nomad is {{well known}} for its dark {{alternate}} mode, the demon path, which is accessed by choosing the [...] "evil" [...] dialogue options {{at the start of the}} game. In this route, Revya decides to use Gig's great power to essentially destroy the world, and strikes down both Layna and Danette at the game's outset. With Gig's eager assistance, the player controls Revya in his/her bloody rampage across the continent, as they become the tyrannical [...] "Devourlord" [...] and commit atrocity after atrocity against the people of <b>Raide.</b> Like the normal mode, the demon path has a number of different dialogue options and endings, as well as unique characters Revya can dominate (mostly villains) that are unplayable in the normal game.|$|E

In 2000, he played the song Né Dans les Rues with the French reggae singer Pierpoljak.|$|R
5000|$|The group {{released}} its eighth album in November 2009.
