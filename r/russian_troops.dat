5|$|Poti is {{the crucial}} port of Georgia on the Black Sea {{and serves as}} an {{essential}} entry point for Transcaucasia and the landlocked nations of Central Asia. Russian aircraft attacked the town of Poti on 8 August, causing a two-day shutdown of the port. Russia positioned ships {{in the vicinity of}} Poti and other Georgian ports on 10 August 2008. The next day, Georgian and Russian representatives said that <b>Russian</b> <b>troops</b> were in Poti, although Russia claimed it had only sent a task force for surveying the area. On 13 August, six Georgian naval vessels were sunk by <b>Russian</b> <b>troops</b> in Poti. Russian deputy chief of the General staff, Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, denied the Russian presence in Poti the following day. One day after Russia's declaration of the beginning of the withdrawal from Georgia, 70 Russian soldiers moved into the port on the morning of 19 August. Russian forces took twenty-one Georgian soldiers prisoner and grabbed five US Humvees in Poti, taking them to a military base occupied by <b>Russian</b> <b>troops</b> in Senaki. The Wall Street Journal said that Russian actions in Poti constituted an additional attack on Georgian economy. Russian military was looting and damaging properties during their presence in Poti, even ransacking toilets.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I on 3 August 1914, Józef Piłsudski formed a small cadre military unit, the First Cadre Company—the predecessor of the Polish Legions—which set out from Kraków {{to fight for the}} liberation of Poland. The city was briefly besieged by <b>Russian</b> <b>troops</b> in November 1914. Austrian rule in Kraków ended in 1918 when the Polish Liquidation Committee assumed power.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} on 8 August the Georgian 4th Brigade from Vaziani Military Base {{advanced}} on the left flank of Tskhinvali; the 3rd Brigade advanced on the right flank. The aim of the flank operations was to advance northward after capturing key positions.

5|$|Russia {{continued}} {{to maintain a}} single checkpoint in the border village of Perevi. On 12 December, Russian forces withdrew; eight hours later they re-entered the village and Georgian police withdrew after the Russians threatened to fire.

5|$|The NATO-Russia Council {{meeting was}} mostly {{noted by the}} absence of both Russian {{president}} Vladimir Putin and of any progress concerning the ratification of the adapted CFE treaty or the withdrawal of <b>Russian</b> <b>troops</b> from Georgia and Moldova.

5|$|A new {{front was}} opened in Salonika {{at the request}} of the Greek government, {{intending}} to support Serbian forces and oppose Bulgaria.

French, British and <b>Russian</b> <b>troops</b> arrived in Salonika between 1916 and 1917 and became known as the Allied Army of the Orient or Allied Army of the East, under the overall command of French General Maurice Sarrail.|$|E

5|$|After the 1917 October Revolution, {{the chaotic}} retreat of <b>Russian</b> <b>troops</b> from Western Armenia escalated. Bolshevik Russia and the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Erzincan on 5 December 1917, ending the hostilities. The Soviet Russian {{government}} formally acknowledged {{the right of}} self-determination of the Ottoman Armenians in January 1918, but on 3 March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers, ceding Western Armenia and large areas in Eastern Europe to concentrate its forces against the Whites in the Russian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|After the German Ober Ost garrisons were {{withdrawn}} from the Eastern Front following the Armistice, both Soviet Russian armies and Polish ones moved in to fill the vacuum. The newly independent Polish state and the Soviet government each sought territorial expansion in the region. Polish and <b>Russian</b> <b>troops</b> first clashed in February 1919, with the conflict developing into the Polish–Soviet War. Unlike the Soviets' previous conflicts, this had greater implications for the export of revolution {{and the future of}} Europe. Polish forces pushed into Ukraine and by May 1920 had taken Kiev from the Soviets. After forcing the Polish Army back, Lenin urged the Red Army to invade Poland itself, believing that the Polish proletariat would rise up to support the <b>Russian</b> <b>troops</b> and thus spark European revolution. Trotsky and other Bolsheviks were sceptical, but agreed to the invasion. The Polish proletariat did not rise, and the Red Army was defeated at the Battle of Warsaw. The Polish armies pushed the Red Army back into Russia, forcing Sovnarkom to sue for peace; the war culminated in the Peace of Riga, in which Russia ceded territory to Poland.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of naval attacks, {{it was decided that}} ground forces were {{necessary}} to eliminate the Turkish mobile artillery and allow minesweepers to clear the waters for larger vessels. The British Secretary of State for War, Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, appointed General Sir Ian Hamilton to command the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF) that was to carry out the mission. The MEF consisted of Birdwood's ANZAC, British 29th Division, British Royal Naval Division and the French Corps expéditionnaire d'Orient. Some 40,000 <b>Russian</b> <b>troops</b> would participate in the capture or occupation of Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|Although the Polish {{division}} was defeated, the Russian forces did not pursue. This allowed the Poles {{to mount a}} night counterattack. A single machine gun battalion attacked a position behind Radzymin. While ultimately unsuccessful, the battalion forced the <b>Russian</b> <b>troops</b> to remain stationary overnight, giving the Poles badly needed time to regroup and receive reinforcements, which {{came in the form}} of a single regiment from the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division. Instead of retreating to the third line of defences, the Poles remained outside the town, hoping to retake it the following day.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the fall}} of the Raevsky redoubt did not have much meaning. The <b>Russian</b> <b>troops</b> {{successfully}} moved to the rear without being destroyed (despite suffering heavy losses). So, in spite of losing some areas in the battlefield, the Russian formation was prevented from collapsing. On the French side, the gain of the Raevsky redoubt cost them large casualties and, after that, Napoleon himself ordered his troops to retreat to the starting line. The Russians then reoccupied their previous positions.|$|E
5|$|In the Duchy of Warsaw, Poniatowski {{defeated}} the Austrians at Raszyn on 19 April, prevented Austrian forces from crossing the Vistula river, {{and forced the}} Austrians to retreat from occupied Warsaw. Afterward, the Poles went on to invade Galicia, with some success, but the offensive quickly stalled with heavy casualties. The Austrians also won a few battles but were hampered {{by the presence of}} <b>Russian</b> <b>troops</b> whose intentions were unclear and that did not allow them to advance. Eventually, the defeat of the main Austrian army at Wagram decided of the fate of the war.|$|E
