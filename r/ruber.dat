5|$|Like most of {{the species}} of the order Phallales, Clathrus <b>ruber</b> is saprobic—a {{decomposer}} of wood and plant organic matter—and is commonly found fruiting in mulch beds. The fungus grows alone or clustered together near woody debris, in lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically in 1729, by the Italian Pier Antonio Micheli in his Nova plantarum genera iuxta Tournefortii methodum disposita, {{who gave it}} its current scientific name. The species was once referred to by American authors as Clathrus cancellatus L., as they used a system of nomenclature based on the former American Code of Botanical Nomenclature, in which {{the starting point for}} naming species was Linnaeus's 1753 Species Plantarum. The International Code for Botanical Nomenclature now uses the same starting date, but names of Gasteromycetes used by Christian Hendrik Persoon in his Synopsis Methodica Fungorum (1801) are sanctioned and automatically replace earlier names. Since Persoon used the specific epithet <b>ruber,</b> the correct name for the species is Clathrus <b>ruber.</b> Several historical names of the fungus are now synonyms: Clathrus flavescens, named by Persoon in 1801; Clathrus cancellatus by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and published by Elias Fries in 1823; Clathrus nicaeensis, published by Jean-Baptiste Barla in 1879; and Clathrus <b>ruber</b> var. flavescens, published by Livio Quadraccia and Dario Lunghini in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Clathrus <b>ruber</b> was {{originally}} described by Micheli from Italy. It is considered native to southern and central continental Europe, {{as well as}} Macaronesia (the Azores and the Canary Islands), western Turkey, North Africa (Algeria), and western Asia (Iran). The fungus is rare in central Europe, and is listed in the Red data book of Ukraine.|$|E

50|$|On Easter Day in 2000 another open-air {{service of}} worship {{was held on}} the summit of <b>Rubers</b> Law. People from Bedrule, Denholm and Minto churches met there to commemorate both the two thousandth anniversary {{of the birth of}} Jesus Christ, and earlier Christians who had worshipped in that place. The event is {{recorded}} by a metal plate fixed to the summit rocks of the hill. Bedrule church holds a service of worship on <b>Rubers</b> Law each Easter Day.|$|R
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by American mycologists Alexander H. Smith and Harry D. Thiers in their 1978 monograph on the boletes of Michigan. The type collection {{was made by}} Smith near Ann Arbor, and is stored at the University of Michigan Herbarium. The specific epithet rubroflammeus derives from the Latin words <b>ruber</b> ("red") and flammeus ("flaming").|$|E
5|$|Clathrus <b>ruber</b> is {{the type}} species of the genus Clathrus, and {{is part of the}} group of Clathrus species known as the Laternoid series. Common {{features}} uniting this group include the vertical arms of the receptacle (fruit body) that are not joined together at the base, and the spongy structure of the receptacle. According to a molecular analysis published in 2006, out of the about 40 Phallales species used in the study, C.ruber is most closely related to Aseroe rubra, Clathrus archeri, Laternea triscapa, and Clathrus chrysomycelinus.|$|E
5|$|Clathrus <b>ruber</b> was {{illustrated}} in 1560 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner in his Nomenclator Aquatilium Animantium—Gesner mistook the mushroom for a marine organism. It {{appeared in a}} woodcut in John Gerard's 1597 Great Herball, shortly thereafter in Carolus Clusius 1601 Fungorum in Pannoniis Observatorum Brevis Historia, {{and was one of}} the species featured in Cassiano dal Pozzo's museo cartaceo ("paper museum") that consisted of thousands of illustrations of the natural world.|$|E
40|$|<b>Rubers</b> Law is a {{prominent}} {{hill in the}} Scottish Borders with an extensive archaeological history. The discovery of approximately 30 Roman building stones on the summit in the early 20 th century led {{to the conclusion that}} it had been the site of a Roman signal station, despite a lack of concrete evidence for a Roman occupation. This paper uses GIS and visibility analysis to examine if <b>Rubers</b> Law fits into the known Roman communication and infrastructure network of towers, forts, camps and roadways in southern Scotland. Visibility and intervisibility from the Roman towers was analysed using four types of viewshed analysis: regular, cumulative, fuzzy, and probable. The results were analysed to determine what would be visible from <b>Rubers</b> Law from a tower between 8. 7 m and 11. 7 m high. The various viewshed methods were also compared; it was determined that regular and cumulative viewsheds over predict visibility, while fuzzy and probable methods are more robust. Based on this analysis, a tower on <b>Rubers</b> Law could have been a major relay station, passing messages from Brownhart Law and Craik Cross Hill to Eildon Hill North and Newstead Roman Fort...|$|R

50|$|Up to 1919 <b>Rubers</b> Law was {{the origin}} (meridian) of the 6 inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps of Roxburghshire. After that the maps of Roxburghshire were drawn {{according}} to the meridian of Lanark Church Spire in Lanarkshire.|$|R
5|$|Juvenile Caribbean reef {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger sharks {{such as the}} tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) and the bull shark (C. leucas). Few parasites are known for this species; one is a dark {{variegated}} leech often seen trailing from its first dorsal fin. Off northern Brazil, juveniles seek out cleaning stations occupied by yellownose gobies (Elacatinus randalli), which clean the sharks of parasites while they lie still on the bottom. Horse-eye jacks (Caranx latus) and bar jacks (Carangoides <b>ruber)</b> routinely school around Caribbean reef sharks.|$|E
5|$|Ornithologists James Hancock and Jim Kushlan also {{consider}} the two to be a single species, with the differences in plumage, size, skin coloration and degree of bill darkening during breeding season forming the diagnostic characters. They have proposed the populations recontacted in northwestern South America {{after a period of}} separation, and that the color difference is likely due to the presence of an enzyme that allows uptake of pigment in the diet. They have questioned whether white-plumaged birds of South America are in fact part of the <b>ruber</b> rather than the albus taxon, and acknowledge that more investigation is needed to determine this.|$|E
5|$|Three early {{registers}} of {{the dean}} and chapter of Wells– the Liber Albus I (White Book; R I), Liber Albus II (R III) and Liber <b>Ruber</b> (Red Book; R II, section i)– were edited by W. H. B. Bird for the Historical Manuscripts Commissioners {{and published in}} 1907. The books comprise, with some repetition, a cartulary of possessions of the cathedral, with grants of land dating back {{as early as the}} 8th century, well before the development of hereditary surnames in England; they also comprise acts of the Dean and Chapter, and surveys of their estates, mostly in Somerset.|$|E
50|$|The {{village of}} Denholm is {{situated}} in Teviotdale, about halfway between the towns of Hawick and Jedburgh. It lies in gentle rolling countryside between <b>Rubers</b> Law and the Minto Hills, volcanic outcrops which thrust up through the underlying Old Red Sandstone.|$|R

50|$|Law is {{a common}} word for a hill in the {{south-east}} of Scotland, especially in Lothian and The Borders. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word hlāw (tumulus or hill). The origin and meaning of the first element of the name, <b>Rubers,</b> is not known.|$|R
5|$|Clathrus <b>ruber</b> is {{a species}} of fungus in the stinkhorn family, and the type species of the genus Clathrus. It is {{commonly}} known as the latticed stinkhorn, the basket stinkhorn, or the red cage, alluding to the striking fruit bodies that are shaped somewhat like a round or oval hollow sphere with interlaced or latticed branches. The fungus is saprobic, feeding off decaying woody plant material, and is often found alone or in groups in leaf litter on garden soil, grassy places, or on woodchip garden mulches. Although considered primarily a European species, C.ruber has been introduced to other areas, and now has a wide distribution that includes northern Africa, Asia, Australia, and North and South America. The species was illustrated in the scientific literature during the 16th century, but was not officially described until 1729.|$|E
25|$|Not enough {{genetic and}} {{morphological}} diversity exists between C. exsul from Cedros Island and C. <b>ruber</b> {{from the mainland}} to warrant the recognition of both species. Since C. exsul Garman (1884) has priority over C. <b>ruber</b> Cope (1892), they suggested the island population {{be referred to as}} C. e. exsul and those from the mainland as C. e. <b>ruber.</b> In response, Smith et al. (1998) petitioned the ICZN to validate <b>ruber</b> over exsul in the interest of nomenclatural stability. In 2000, the ICZN published Opinion 1960 in which they ruled C. <b>ruber</b> should have precedence over C. exsul.|$|E
25|$|Crotalus <b>ruber</b> is {{very similar}} in pattern to C. atrox, but it is {{distinguished}} by its reddish color, to which the specific name, <b>ruber,</b> refers. Also, the first lower labial scale on each side is transversely divided to form a pair of anterior chin shields.|$|E
40|$|Dicranella staphylina Whitehouse, {{a species}} {{recently}} described from Great Britain, is now recorded from Belgium, Denmark and The Netherlands.

50|$|Most of <b>Rubers</b> Law {{is made of}} red {{sandstones}} {{and other}} sediments {{which used to be}} known as the Upper Old Red Sandstone. These rocks, now assigned to the Stratheden or Inverclyde groups (undifferentiated), were formed during the late Devonian or early Carboniferous Periods from the sand and gravel deposits of ancient river systems.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rubers</b> Law is a prominent, conical {{hill in the}} Scottish Borders area of {{south-east}} Scotland. It {{stands on}} the south bank of the River Teviot, between the towns of Hawick and Jedburgh, {{and south of the}} village of Denholm. The hill is on the border between the historic parishes of Cavers and Hobkirk, and until 1975 it stood within the historic county of Roxburghshire.|$|R
25|$|The {{bar jack}} was first scientifically {{described}} {{under the name}} Somber <b>ruber</b> by Marcus Bloch, in 1793 based on a specimen taken from {{the east coast of}} America, which was designated to be the holotype. Caranx is derived from the French word, carangue, or a fish from the Caribbean, while <b>ruber</b> (sometimes incorrectly spelled rubber) is Latin for red. Bloch attributed the species to the mackerels of the genus Scomber, a common practice during this period as the genus Caranx and subsequent family Carangidae were not created until 1801 by Bernard Germain de Lacépède. The species has been variably placed in either Carangoides or Caranx since 1801, with the status of the species still somewhat ambiguous. A recent study of the molecular systematics of the Carangidae using mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences strongly supported placement in the genus Caranx, with C. <b>ruber</b> being most closely related to Caranx bartholomaei, itself still often classified under Carangoides. Both C. <b>ruber</b> and C. bartholomaei were strongly related to other well known members of Caranx, and only distantly related to any other species of Carangoides.|$|E

50|$|In the 17th Century Alexander Peden {{may have}} preached to a conventicle of Covenanters from a chasm in the cliffs on <b>Rubers</b> Law {{which is known}} as Peden's Pulpit.The {{restoration}} of King Charles II of Scotland in 1660 was followed by an attempt to impose Episcopal polity upon the Church of Scotland. The Covenanters were those who vigorously sought to maintain the Kirk's Presbyterian polity. Ministers ejected from the Kirk, like Peden, preached to illegal conventicles of their followers {{in the open air}} between 1660 and 1688.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{structures}} {{have been built}} on or around the summit of <b>Rubers</b> Law. The earliest {{may have been an}} Early Iron Age hill fort or oppidum, represented by the remains of an outer wall, running at the same level around the hilltop, enclosing an area of 7 acre with a well-marked entrance to the south. No Roman masonry has been incorporated into this wall, suggesting an early date, though {{it is also possible that}} it could be the wall of a cattle compound associated with a later post-Roman fort.|$|R
50|$|This {{sedimentary}} deposition {{was followed}} by a period of volcanic eruptions which produced a series of basaltic lavas, some of which are now found near Kelso. The summit rocks of <b>Rubers</b> Law were formed within a volcanic vent. There is a small area of volcanic agglomerate, formed in the vent by an explosive eruption of magma from the volcano. The rest of the summit rocks are microgabbro (previously known as dolerite), the remains of a volcanic plug formed from magma which solidified within the vent. Another microgabbro plug is located among the trees of Denholmhill Wood, 2 km north of the summit.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rubers</b> Law is a conical hill, {{elongated}} in a north-south direction. While {{it stands}} in relative isolation, it {{is linked to}} Peel Fell by a ridge of high ground, and so forms a northern projection of the Cheviot Hills which straddle the Anglo-Scottish border. It stands on the south bank of the River Teviot and forms a conspicuous landmark from much of Teviotdale. It rises to 424 m and has a prominence of 196 m above the col to its south. This is well {{in excess of the}} 150 m prominence needed to classify it as a Marilyn.All sides of the hill drain into the Teviot. The southern and eastern slopes do so via the Rule Water, and the western slopes via the Dean Burn.|$|R
