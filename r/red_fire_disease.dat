50|$|Researchers {{from the}} Agricultural Research Service are taking {{advantage}} of protists as pathogens to control <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant (Solenopsis invicta) populations in Argentina. Spore-producing protists such as Kneallhazia solenopsae (recognized as a sister clade or the closest relative to the fungus kingdom now) can reduce <b>red</b> <b>fire</b> ant populations by 53-100%. Researchers have also been able to infect phorid fly parasitoids of the ant with the protist without harming the flies. This turns the flies into a vector that can spreads the pathogenic protist between <b>red</b> <b>fire</b> ant colonies.|$|R

5000|$|Because of its {{tropical}} climate and {{its proximity to}} Mexico and Central America, Louisiana is able to support many invasive species that cannot survive elsewhere in the U.S. One such example is the <b>red</b> <b>fire</b> ant. Native to South America, the <b>red</b> <b>fire</b> ant has flourished in many southern U.S. states since its introduction in the 1930s. Superficially similar to most other ants, the fire ant is a vicious predator, attacking birds, rodents, and larger mammals in swarms.|$|R
40|$|The Schaus swallowtail, Papilio aristodemus ponceanus, {{historically}} {{occurred in}} tropical hardwood hammocks from South Miami {{to the upper}} Florida Keys and is currently listed as federally endangered. Much of the remaining hardwood hammock habitat is fragmented by roads and human development that may alter the microhabitat within the hammocks and increase the probability of invasion by non-native predators and competitors. One non-indigenous species that has recently invaded the Florida Keys, and that may impact the Schaus swallowtail is the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren). We estimated abundance of <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ants in Schaus swallowtail habitat on Key Largo, and the decrease in <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ants resulting from the application of chemical ant baits. In addition, we conducted laboratory experiments to determine how vulnerable swallowtail life stages are to <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant predation. We found <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ants at 50 % of transects in the hardwood hammock, up to 40 m from hammock edge. Chemical treatments were only partially effective in decreasing <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant abundance, and the effect was short-lived. All immature swallowtail life stages were vulnerable to predation by <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ants. Habitat restoration that decreases <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant abundance {{may be the most}} costeffective and long-term method of decreasing impacts from <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ants...|$|R

25|$|The red {{imported}} ant can be misidentified as the similar-looking S. richteri. The {{two species}} {{can be distinguished}} from each other through morphological examinations of the head, thorax, and postpetiole. In S. richteri, {{the sides of the}} head are broadly elliptical and the cordate shape seen in the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant is absent. The region of the occipital lobes that are situated nearby the midline and occipital excision appear more crease-like in S. richteri than it does in the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant. The scapes of S. richteri are longer than they are in the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant, and the pronotum has strong angulate shoulders. Such character is almost absent in the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant. A shallow but sunken area is only known in the larger workers of S. richteri, which is located in the posterior region of the dorsum of the pronotum. This feature is completely absent in larger <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant workers. The <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant's promesonotum is strongly convex, whereas this feature is weakly convex in S. richteri. Upon examination, the base of the propodeum is elongated and straight in S. richteri, while convex and shorter in the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant. It also has a wide postpetiole with either straight or diverging sides. The postpetiole in S. richteri is narrower with converging sides. In S. richteri, the transverse impression on the posterodorsal portion of the postpetiole is strong, but weak or absent in the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant. As well as that, S. richteri workers are 15% larger than <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> ant workers, are blackish-brown, and have a yellow stripe on the dorsal side of the gaster.|$|R
