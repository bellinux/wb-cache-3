500|$|A short passing loop {{was built}} at Llangefni station in 1877 for engines to run round, but at only [...] long {{it was not}} of much use for {{allowing}} passenger trains to pass each other. A <b>refuge</b> <b>siding</b> was built for freight trains at Llanerchymedd in 1878, along with an engine shed in Amlwch. In 1882, new station buildings replaced the basic wooden sheds at Holland Arms, Llangwyllog and Rhosgoch, as well as development of the junction at Gaerwen into a full double junction, and a second signal cabin built there. An extended Amlwch station received a canopy by 1884. The staff and ticket system was supplemented with block working in 1886, and was replaced with the electric staff system in 1894.|$|E
50|$|A <b>refuge</b> <b>siding</b> is a single-ended, or dead-end, siding off {{a running}} line, {{which may be}} used to {{temporarily}} accommodate a train so that another one can pass it. For example, a <b>refuge</b> <b>siding</b> might be used by a slow goods train to allow a fast passenger train to pass. It is similar in concept to a passing loop but is connected to the main line at only one end, rather than both ends.|$|E

50|$|Lake Elmer Thomas Recreation Area (LETRA) {{which is}} on the Fort Sill {{military}} base, provides camping areas, cabins, a swim beach, water slides, picnic areas, boating ramps and boat rentals. On the <b>refuge</b> <b>side</b> of the lake, there are two fishing piers and a boating ramp.|$|R
50|$|Access is {{primarily}} by {{boat on the}} <b>refuge's</b> Louisiana <b>side</b> and road access {{is available on the}} <b>refuge's</b> Mississippi <b>side.</b> In the summer of 2002, a new 0.75 mi walking trail was unveiled on the Louisiana <b>side</b> of the <b>Refuge</b> that allows access into the interior of Bogue Chitto's habitat.|$|R
50|$|The {{pronghorn}} are North America's fastest land animal, {{capable of}} {{speeds up to}} 45 mph, run free across the upland sagebrush at the east side. Bighorn sheep prefer the rocky cliffs of the <b>refuge's</b> west <b>side.</b> Numerous shallow lakes, grassy spring fed meadows attract the greatest variety of species.|$|R
50|$|Drem {{signal box}} closed on 21 November 1977, when new {{signalling}} controlled from Edinburgh was commissioned. The track was remodelled {{such that the}} old Down <b>Refuge</b> <b>siding</b> became a refuge loop, whilst the junction of the North Berwick branch was moved further east, with the original branch track becoming an Up Refuge loop (replacing the old Up <b>Refuge</b> <b>siding</b> west of the station). One siding in the old goods yard was retained for use by engineering trains {{and the rest of}} the yard was redeveloped as the station car park.|$|E
50|$|In 1907, the {{northbound}} platform {{was converted}} {{to an island}} with a new southbound track. The former southbound track (current Platform 4) became the northbound track, with the former southbound platform (current Platform 3) becoming a <b>refuge</b> <b>siding.</b>|$|E
50|$|Electric Train Staff Working {{introduced}} 11 November 1918â€”replacing the Staff and Ticket system (26 May 1897) thereby allowing three {{trains to}} operate upon the branch. In Aug. 1924, No. 4 Mortuary Stations capacity increased. An additional <b>refuge</b> <b>siding</b> (the Dead-end Siding, 645 feet) allowed four trains {{to run on}} the Branch.|$|E

50|$|The Exeter {{crossing}} loop collision was {{a railway}} accident that occurred between the Temora Mail Train and a goods train at Exeter railway station, New South Wales, on 13 March 1914. At {{that time the}} main line was a single track, with a crossing loop and a down <b>refuge</b> <b>siding</b> at Exeter.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes refuge sidings {{were needed}} {{where there were}} steep ramps on the line. For example, at Gresford railway station in Australia, the {{gradient}} was so steep that a <b>refuge</b> <b>siding</b> was required at the station in case some of the wagons or coaches of a train had {{to be left behind}} so that it could climb the hill.|$|E
50|$|A refuge loop {{built on}} the ruling grade on Cowan bank proved to be {{unworkable}} as the refuged train could not restart. This lesson was learned at Dombarton, where the uphill trains restart from level track. A <b>refuge</b> <b>siding</b> at Razorback halfway up the 1 in 75 ruling grade climb from Fish River to Cullerin also allowed trains to restart from level track.|$|E

50|$|In 1989 the box {{was taken}} out of use, with the signal heads being removed and the token {{instrument}} from Tan-y-Bwlch, and the although trap points (from Minffordd) were installed at the Tan-y-Bwlch end of the loop, they were never commissioned. During this period, the ground frame was only usable as a <b>refuge</b> <b>siding,</b> and {{it was not possible to}} cross passenger trains.|$|E
50|$|In 1940 {{the down}} <b>refuge</b> <b>siding</b> was {{converted}} into a loop so that goods trains could run straight in without reversing, and three loop sidings were provided behind the platform. These were originally intended to help the flow of goods traffic during the Second World War, but later became a useful place to stable empty passenger trains on busy summer Saturdays.|$|E

The experiment ended, after a harsh cold-front, and it was observed that all fish in every pond were dead. However, the refuge design utilizing geothermal water was successful in maintaining temperatures in the refuges above those observed in open ponds. Water analysis indicated that chlorides may have been too low for survival of red drum at stressful low temperatures. Another study with juvenile red drum (> 7 g) was conducted in which the same diets were fed for 6 weeks, after which fish were transferred to the following three water treatments prepared from fresh well-water used in the refuge study: unamended well-water; artificial seawater (6 '/ [...] salinity); and well-water + NaCi (6 '/ [...] salinity). Fish in these water treatments were subjected to an acute cold-tolerance assay. The median lethal temperature for fish held in the artificial seawater was significantly (P< 0. 05) lower than the other treatments; well-water + NaCi did not increase cold-tolerance over well-water alone. However, fish not challenged with cold had the highest survival in artificial seawater followed by well-water + NaCl, but no survival in unamended well-water alone. These studies suggest that exposure to water inadequate in chlorides and possibly other ions can result in reduced cold tolerance of red drum. Dietary lipid effects on cold tolerance were not significant in either study...|$|R
50|$|The {{line through}} Exminster was doubled in November 1859 {{and so a}} second {{platform}} for southbound (down) trains was built; passengers used the road bridge to cross to it.

50|$|Fluvial Montana {{grayling}} {{spend their}} entire life cycle in riverine environments. They make seasonalmigrations within the river system for spawning, feeding and overwintering. Migrations {{of up to}} 50 mi have been documented. Grayling inhabit cold, freestone streams having low to intermediate gradients. Adult fluvial grayling prefer pool habitats. In Montana, they spawn from late April to mid-May by depositing adhesive eggs over sand and gravel without excavating a redd. Eggs mature and hatch within a few weeks. Juvenile grayling are weak swimmers and prefer rearing habitat along stream margins that serve as velocity <b>refuges,</b> back-waters in <b>side</b> channels, or waters adjacent to beaver dams. Grayling in Montana typically reach maturity in their third or fourth year of life, and seldom live beyond six years. grayling, including juveniles are opportunistic feeders and routinely feed on larval, pupal and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically caddisflies, stoneflies, mayflies and aquatic diptera). They also consume adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that fall into the water. Other prey include crayfish, shrimp, and other crustaceans. The aggressive feeding behavior of grayling is linked to their pattern of habitat selection whereby they often reside in deep pools with little large woody debris that allow for efficient and opportunistic feeding by this visual predator.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the days}} before he began to expend his surplus energy in playing Rugby football, the Welshman was accustomed, {{whenever}} the monotony of his everyday life began to oppress him, to collect a few friends and make raids {{across the border into}} England, to the huge discomfort of the dwellers on the other side. It was to cope with this habit that Dreever Castle, in the county of Shropshire, came into existence. It met a long-felt want. In time of trouble, it became a haven of <b>refuge.</b> From all <b>sides,</b> people poured into it, emerging cautiously when the marauders had disappeared. In the whole history of the castle, there is but one instance recorded of a bandit attempting to take the place by storm, and the attack was an emphatic failure. On receipt of a ladleful of molten lead, aimed to a nicety by one John, the Chaplain (evidently one of those sporting parsons), this warrior retired, done to a turn, to his mountain fastnesses, and was never heard of again. He would seem, however, to have passed the word around among his friends, for subsequent raiding parties studiously avoided the castle, and a peasant who had succeeded in crossing its threshold was for the future considered to be [...] "home" [...] and out of the game.|$|R
40|$|Premise of {{the study}} :New {{insights}} {{into the history of}} the African rainforest can be gathered from the phylogeographic structures of their constituent species, but few studies have been performed in this ecosystem. We studied the phylogeographic structure of Santiria trimera, a primate- and bird-dispersed, dioecious tree typical of mature African rainforests. Methods :We sequenced three chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) regions (trnL-F, rbcL, and rpl 36 -infA-rps 8) in 377 individuals from 42 populations. Results :Sequence chromatograms regularly displayed double peaks of unequal heights. Cloning of PCR products and sequencing of outgroup taxa led to assigning the taller peak in ambiguous sequence positions to cpDNA. A total of 14 polymorphic cpDNA sites and 12 haplotypes were detected. Populations from three distinct biogeographic regions, namely, Upper Guinea, Lower Guinea, and the volcanic island of Sao Tome, did not share any haplotype, indicating allopatric divergence. In Lower Guinea, Gabonese forests had high diversity mainly from the sympatry of two genetically divergent morphotypes, whereas forests of eastern Cameroon were less diversified. The two haplotypes of the morphotype without stilt roots were distributed north and south of the Ogooue River, suggesting <b>refuges</b> on both <b>sides</b> of the river bed. Conclusions :The divergence between Upper and Lower Guinean rainforests is explained by the discontinuity of forest between those regions throughout most of the Quaternary. The distribution of rare endemic haplotypes concurred with proposed Pleistocene rainforest refuges in west and southwest Cameroon. Overall, phylogeographic structure is consistent with the biogeographic hypotheses largely based on patterns of species diversity. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
