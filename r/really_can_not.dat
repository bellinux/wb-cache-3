Ten pounds of sugar? Who gets it all? I never taste sugar from one year's end to another. Waste, nothing but waste." [...] Here Mrs. Finch looked my way, and saw me at the door. [...] "Oh? Madame Pratolungo? How d'ye do? Don't go away--I've just done. A bottle of blacking? My shoes are a disgrace to the house. Five pounds of rice? If I had Indian servants, five pounds of rice would last them for a year. There! take the things away into the kitchen. Excuse my dress, Madame Pratolungo. How am I to dress, with all I have got to do? What do you say? My time must indeed be fully occupied? Ah, that's just where it is! When you have lost half an hour in the morning, and can't pick it up again--to say nothing of having the store-room on your mind, and the children's dinner late, and the baby fractious--one slips on a {{petticoat}} and a shawl, and gives it up in despair. What can I have done with my handkerchief? Would you mind looking among those bottles behind you? Oh, here it is, under the baby. Might I trouble you to hold my book for one moment? I think the baby will be quieter if I put him the other way." [...] Here Mrs. Finch turned the baby over on his stomach, and patted him briskly on the back. At this change in his circumstances, the unappeasable infant only roared louder than ever. His mother appeared to be perfectly unaffected by the noise. This resigned domestic martyr looked placidly up at me, as I stood before her, bewildered, with the novel in my hand. [...] "Ah, that's a very interesting story," [...] she went on. [...] "Plenty of love in it, you know. You have come for it, haven't you? I remember I promised to lend it to you yesterday." [...] Before I could answer the cook appeared again, in search of more household commodities. Mrs. Finch repeated the woman's demands, one by one as she made them, in tones of despair. [...] "Another bottle of vinegar? I believe you water the garden with vinegar! More starch? The Queen's washing, I'm firmly persuaded, doesn't come to so much as ours. Sandpaper? Sandpaper means wastepaper in this profligate house. I shall tell your master. I <b>really</b> <b>can</b> <b>NOT</b> make the housekeeping money last at this rate. Don't go, Madame Pratolungo! I shall have done directly. What! You must go! Oh, then, put the book back on my lap, please--and look behind that sack of flour. The first volume slipped down there this morning, and I haven't had time to pick it up since. (Sandpaper! Do you think I'm made of sandpaper!) Have you found the first volume? Ah, that's it. All over flour! there's a hole in the sack I suppose. Twelve sheets of sandpaper used in a week! What for? I defy any of you to tell me what for. Waste! waste! shameful sinful waste!" [...] At this point in Mrs. Finch's lamentations, I made my escape with the book, and left the subject of Oscar Dubourg to be introduced at a fitter opportunity. The last words I heard, through the screams of the baby, as I ascended the stairs, were words still relating to the week's prodigal consumption of sandpaper. Let us drop a tear, if you please, over the woes of Mrs. Finch, and leave the British matron apostrophizing domestic economy in the odorous seclusion of her own storeroom.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of tourism in the Adriatic region of Yugoslavia brings about, inter alia, considerable sociodemographic changes and causes {{before all the}} transfer of population from agricultural to other activities. Taking into account the economical possibilities brought about by tourism, as "well as plans {{for the development of}} shipbuilding, aluminium and other industries, the author of this article undertook an analysis of influences of such changes on agricultural production and social structure of population. At the beginning the Adriatic region was defined. It is a karst region situated between the coast line and Dinar’s mountain system. There is not much arrable land in it and the climate is rather dry. The relief and the climate of the Region caused a peculiar spatial arrangements of the population and its settlements. From old times the existence of people in this region has been depending on sea and transport between the coast and the inland. Nevertheless up to our century the population depended mostly on work in agriculture, especially on growing grape, olive, vegetable, tobacco and breeding sheep, goats and cattle. Nowdays too, peasants grow cereals quite often, but vields per hectare are very low. The annual deficit of wheat amounts up to 180, 000 tons. The author suggests to exclude cereals from agriculture in this region. Social agricultural enterprises in 1963. owned 23, 700 hectares of land or 5, 3 % of the total hectrage of arrable land in this region. The rest of land is being cultivated by private landowners. Their landestates are very small, for instance even 46, 8 % private landestates in Dalmatia and Hrvatsko Primorje are under 2 hectares. Is should be add that every landestate is divided, on the average, on 12, 6 plats each covering about 881 m 2. In such conditions socialistic agricultural enterprises and cooperatives <b>really</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> find their account in buying off such small parcels of land scattered about the stony relief. But {{they will be able to}} gain qualitative land when drainage works of many karst fields get completed. The main author’s attention is directed to the analysis of agricultural population. He explicates the following data: in 1961. 544, 000 persons were engaded in agriculture while the whole population numbered 1. 558, 000. During the period 1953. — 1961. the number of active agricultural population decreased from 315, 000 to 257, 000. In the commune Rijeka there is even only 1, 4 % of agricultural population while at the same time in the hinterland this percentage rise up to 70. On the Adriatic islands there is about 55 % of agricultural population on the average. As a matter of fact 33, 4 % of the total population in Adriatic region earns their living in agriculture, 24 % only in agriculture and 42, 6 % only in nonagricultural activities. Today 26, 9 % of labour power in agriculture is employed in industry, tourism and other nonfarm activities. In other words nonagriculturists (industrial and other workers, clarks and tradesmen) run 1 / 4 of the total number of privately owned landestates. Traditionally the Adriatic region was known as an emigratory region. At the beginning of this century quite a lot of people emigrated to both American continents and to many European countries too. Today these three migratory directions are significant: from the Adriatic region to the inland of Yugoslavia, from villages to towns within the Region itself and to foreign countries. From 1953. till 1961. population of Adriatic towns increased for 21, 4 % while population of Adriatic villages in the same period recorded the population growth of only 0, 6 %. As a matter of fact 104, 000 persons had left 3, 668 villages or 10 % of the present number of population in all Adriatic villages. Every day about 70, 000 persons travel to work from villages to towns and industrial centers. About 50 % of present rural inhabitants are not engaged in agriculture any more. Particularly interesting are the demographic processes on Adriatic islands. They had in 1961. only 8, 8 % more population then in 1857. Today on the largest Adriatic island Krk there is 24 % persons in the age over 60. As the main reason for depopulation tendencies on Adriatic islands, the author pointed out the agrarian crises which has started in 1910. At the end the author proposes some measures for the betterment and improvement of the situation on Adriatic islands...|$|E
