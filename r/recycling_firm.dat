40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the dynamic {{implications}} of recycling for resource use, {{the level of}} economic activity and the long-run development of the economy. In contrast to former approaches, we take explicit account of the circulation of matter in the economy. We consider virgin resources and recycled wastes as essential inputs to production. These material inputs either end up as waste after consumption or are bound in the capital stock [...] depending on the utilization of the produced output. As accumulating wastes can be recycled and again be employed in production, the waste stock serves {{as a source of}} valuable inputs in our model. We focus on the implications of recycling-related market failures and the integration of material balances on the dynamics of the economy. It is shown that a market for waste and subsidies to resource extractors and <b>recycling</b> <b>firms</b> can restore optimality in the decentralized economy.

40|$|We endogenise {{the extent}} of {{consumer}} participation in the recycling process, and analyse {{its effect on the}} 'recycling problem'. When recycling requires consumers to undertake costly sorting activities to separate scrap from household waste, they will participate only if the net reward from sorting is positive. Consumers' sorting cost is subject to a network effect arising due to social norms. With heterogeneous consumers differing in terms of their sorting cost, the entire output of the recyclable product may not be subsequently available as scrap to the <b>recycling</b> <b>firms.</b> This increases the virgin producer's monopoly power, and may also lead to multiple equilibria if the network effect of sorting is sufficiently large. The latter result suggests a role for the government in influencing equilibrium selection to improve social welfare. Depending on the fraction of consumers that participate in recycling, increased societal pressure on consumers to recycle may decrease consumer participation and increase the virgin producer's market power.

40|$|The State of New South Wales Government in Australia {{actively}} pursues {{a policy}} of waste minimization {{as part of an}} effort to promote ecologically sustainable development within the state. The waste minimization strategy is developed within a framework in which resource recovery including re-use, reprocessing, recycling and energy recovery are being encouraged. Construction and demolition materials, which is conservatively estimated to constitute about 16 % of total waste produced in the Sydney basin is an important target group of waste materials for which recycling is a priority. Most of the construction and demolition waste not recycled ended up in the landfills occupying valuable land not to mention the cost incurred in landfilling. This paper describes an overview of the waste minimization approach taken within NSW, the policies and programs that are put in place to bring about successful outcomes. As a result of a nurturing hand from the government, a recycling industry for construction and demolition materials has developed within the state. This paper also presents an industry perspective of construction and demolition waste recycling based on the results of a survey of the <b>recycling</b> <b>firms</b> in the Sydney area to gauge perception of the current state as well as the future of the industry.

40|$|Plastic {{materials}} have been worldwide applied in agriculture for soil mulching, greenhouse covering, irrigation and drainage pipes, bags, containers, pots, and agrochemical containers. All of these plastic materials require, {{at the end}} of their lifetime, suitable collection and treatment systems. Agricultural activities in some areas of the Apulia Region, Southern Italy, are characterized by huge quantities of plastic wastes and local authorities and farmers associations have been interested in solving this problem by applying modern land management tools such as Geographical Information System (G. I. S.). In this paper a G. I. S. methodology is applied to an area of 10, 200 ha in the Trani municipality, included in the Province of Barletta, Andria, Trani (BAT) - Apulia Region, in order to assess the agricultural plastic waste generation. The use of plastics at the agricultural farms has been investigated and related to the land use by applying statistical analysis, orthophoto analysis and remote sensing surveys. These data were introduced in a specific geo-database, and the agricultural plastic waste quantity and localization were defined. Vineyards and olive groves are scattered in this area, so the agricultural plastic waste mostly consists in irrigation pipes, after-use covering films and anti-hail nets used on vineyards. The analysis carried out showed that up to 614 kg ha- 1 of covering films waste are yearly produced in some areas while the estimation of waste from the anti-hail nets was up to 159 kg ha- 1 and the waste yearly produced from irrigation pipes was up to 83 kg ha- 1. Through the use of the G. I. S., the areas with high density of plastic wastes were pointed out thus allowing to determine the suitable location of temporary storage areas and collecting points, in order to optimize the transport of agricultural plastic waste from the farms to the collecting points and to the <b>recycling</b> <b>firms...</b>|$|R

40|$|In our paper, we analyse the {{prospects}} for sustainable growth offered by recycling promoting environmental policies where the main objective of the government is to assure for sustainability {{in the sense of}} a non deteriorating state of the environment. The environment is important for economic production in a twofold way: firstly, it supplies resources as inputs for the production process and, secondly, it serves as a sink for all kinds of waste products generated by economic activities. It is shown that in the absence of environmental policy the overexploitation of the renewable resource stock and the dumping of waste will drive nature beyond the limits of its assimilative and regenerative capacity. Therefore, we focus on these phenomena by modelling on the one hand recycling processes that decrease the flow of waste to the environment and considering on the other hand requirements for a sustainable extraction of raw materials. Hence, by including the intention to spare resources and the aim of reducing waste, we deal with an input problem - sometimes referred to as the primary problem - and an output problem - referred to as the secondary problem. Both problems can be considered to have local, regional and global impacts. For example, reduced resource requirements might decrease the dependency of resource-importing countries (local or regional effect) and will also help to maintain the supply of resources in all world regions (global effect). Alternatively consider the example of a reduction in the combustion of waste which is due to an increase in recycling. The reduction will cause the mitigation of local and regional air pollution as well as of global warming causing emissions of CO 2. Hence, one far-reaching policy additionally induces ancillary benefits on different geographical levels. We use the framework of an endogenous growth model where waste is generated as an undesired byproduct in the production of the desired output. Nature is assumed to have a certain regenerative capability which depends on the state of the environment. Furthermore, environmental quality is negatively affected by the amount of waste dumped and the amount of resources extracted. The amount of dumped waste can be reduced by <b>recycling</b> <b>firms</b> which process the waste and sell it to the intermediate sector where it serves as substitute for natural resources as an input in production. We show that balanced sustainable growth is only possible if governmental policy ensures a recycling rate of unity. By reviewing the debate on complete recycling, we finally discuss this result from an ecological economics point of view. It is shown that the feasibility of complete recycling depends critically on the nature of wastes, a sufficient storing space for wastes and the availability of sufficient energy. growth; recycling; secondary effects; sustainability. ...|$|R
40|$|Plastic {{materials}} are generally used for several agricultural applications: films for greenhouse covering, low or medium tunnel, soil mulching and solarisation, silage, nets, irrigation and drainage pipes, bags, containers, pots, and agrochemical containers. At {{the end of}} their lifetime, the agricultural plastic materials produce, consequently, high volumes of waste to be disposed of. A non suitable disposal system for agricultural plastic waste could induce economical damages, negative effects on the landscape and on the agro-ecosystem with loss of material or energy. With an optimized process of collection, transport and final disposal of, agricultural plastic wastes become "secondary raw materials" that can be re-used for other different applications. In this way the by-products obtained from agricultural plastic wastes become technically efficient and economically feasible. Unfortunately, the management of plastic waste flux coming from agricultural activities is still far to be solved in some Italian areas. Apulia Region, Southern Italy, is characterized by high densities of greenhouses, tunnels, protected vineyards and mulching films for vegetable cultivation. Due to the huge problems connected to the disposal of agricultural plastic wastes, institutions, local authorities and farmers associations of Apulia Region have been interested in solving this problem during the last decade; first attempts were carried out within the European projects “LabelAgriWaste” and “Free Field”. The Province of Barletta-Andria-Trani, an agricultural area typically suited to vineyards, olive groves, orchards, and vegetables, is interested to realize modernization actions for the growers of the area. In fact the Province of Barletta-Andria-Trani is a partner, together with the University of Bari and other institutions, in the project “Agricultural Waste valorisation for a competitive and sustainable Regional Development – AWARD”, European Territorial Cooperation Programme Greece-Italy 2007 - 2013. The aim of this project is to offer an optimized management of agricultural plastic wastes. A Geographical Information System (G. I. S) is one of the strategies to pursue at local scale, with regard to the municipal territories of the Province of Barletta-Andria-Trani. In the present paper, the G. I. S. is described at a province scale: the principal agricultural areas with large use of mulching and greenhouse plastic films were examined by means of statistical data (plastic covered surface according to the type of application, the cultivation, the type of plastic material, etc.) and remote sensing survey. These data were introduced in a specific database, based on which three different layers were created. Through the use of the GIS, the road network was evaluated, with reference to the considered agricultural areas and with the existing temporary storage areas, in order to optimize the transport of agricultural plastic waste from the farms to the collecting points and to the <b>recycling</b> <b>firms.</b> The obtained results enabled the analysis and the planning of agricultural plastic waste fluxes, together with the possibility to investigate different development scenarios and to consider new planning strategies for their management...|$|R
40|$|The paper explores {{employment}} {{effects of}} environmental product innovations {{at the firm}} level. The empirical analysis {{is based on the}} establishment panel of the Institute for Employment Research (Nuremberg). A descriptive analysis shows that more than 50 % of the firms in the environmental sector developed new products or improved existing products or services. The most dynamic environmental fields were analytics, consulting, measurement technology, waste disposal and <b>recycling.</b> A <b>firm</b> specialised in environmental research and development seems to have the best employment perspectives in the short and in the long run. Our econometric analysis had to address a simultaneity problem because the decision of a firm on the realisation of innovations and on the enlargement or reduction of employment is mutually dependant. Therefore, we apply a bivariate probit model that allows estimating the two variables simultaneously. The econometric results show that the influence of environmental innovation activities on the employment development is significantly positive. Furthermore, the quantitative importance of the new products with regard to the whole turnover of the firm is also important for employment growth. Within the bivariate probit model, the determinants of environmental innovation activities are also explored. They may be interpreted as indirect influences on the employment development of the firm. The results show that the improvement of the innovative capacities by R&D and further education measures and the existence of a high qualified human capital are significantly important for the development of new products in the environmental sector. A good strategy to improve the innovativeness of a firm seems to be a diversification of environmental product lines offered by the firm...|$|R

50|$|The {{corrosion}} {{problems could}} be structural; for instance where the subframe carrying {{the engine and}} gearbox was bolted to {{the underside of the}} car. The box section to which the rear of the subframe was mounted could corrode badly, causing the subframe to become loose. Although tales of subframes dropping out of vehicles were simply not true, a vehicle with a loose subframe would fail a technical inspection. It was not just the Series 1 cars or saloons - according to an employee of the <b>recycling</b> <b>firm</b> that disposed of the Betas, the Series 2, HPE, Coupe and Spider models were all affected and by late 1983, the scrap dealer Hallett metals in Crewkerne, Somerset had crushed the last of the affected cars. In fact, by 1983 Series 2 cars outnumbered Series 1 models by a large percentage. Deliveries to Hallett Metals were handled mainly by transport company Abbey Hill. Before being crushed (flattened), the engine and gearboxes would be removed and placed in a separate container and no parts were to be removed or resold to the public.In the UK (Lancia's largest export market at the time), the company listened to the complaints from its dealers and customers and commenced a campaign to buy back vehicles affected by the subframe problem. Some of these vehicles were 6 years old or older and belonged to 2nd or 3rd owners. Customers were invited to present their cars to a Lancia dealer for an inspection. If their vehicle was affected by the subframe problem, the customer was offered a part exchange deal to buy another Lancia or Fiat car. The cars that failed the inspection were scrapped. However, on 9 April 1980 the Daily Mirror and TV programmes reported on the issue. There were claims that the problem persisted in later cars by showing photographs of scrapped 1st Series saloons, referring to them as being newer than five and six years old. Other contemporary manufacturers whose cars also suffered from corrosion were not treated as harshly. Lancia had already introduced one year previously a 6-year anti-corrosion warranty - an automotive first in the UK. Whilst later Betas (2nd Series cars) had reinforced subframe mounting points and post-1979 cars were better protected from the elements, these issues damaged the whole marque's sales success on most export markets. The revision to the crossmember was quite simple and meant turning it through 180 degrees forming an 'n' channel rather than a 'u' channel thus preventing dirt and water collecting and causing rust.|$|E
40|$|Recycling {{is one of}} the {{important}} accomplishments of the environmental movement. In the United States, cities and counties, both big and small, have enthusiastically embraced recycling as an important step in creating a greener society. Recycling has increasingly emerged as the best measure of civic engagement in the United States, attesting to its popularity as a solution to our collective environmental troubles. Yet the success of the movement offers an incomplete and misleading story of progress. In her book titled, Recycling Reconsidered: The Present and Future Promise of Environmental Action in the United States, Samantha MacBride draws our attention to the unfulfilled prom-ises of recycling. Specifically, MacBride identifies three types of challenges to the successful adoption of recycling. The first, she argues, is the gradual co-optation and com-modification of the <b>recycling</b> movement by <b>firms</b> seeking to prevent implementa-tion of effective solid-waste management policies. Debated extensively within the Treadmill of Production school in environmental sociology, the commodifi-cation of the recycling program has led to consistent loss of jobs for communi-ties through the implementation of labor-saving techniques, robotics and exper...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} an {{analytical}} framework is developed {{to allow the}} policy makers in the recycling industry to determine the optimal set of policies to obtain a variety of objectives. The scrap iron and steel recycling industry is modeled as an oligopsonistic spatial price equilibrium. Each <b>recycling</b> <b>firm</b> within the industry is modeled as a cost minimizing follower, {{and the government is}} modeled as the policy leader. Within this framework, government 2 ̆ 7 s optimal policies under a variety of objectives is determined. ^ Elaborate procedures are used to estimate local supplies and demands for scrap. Local demands for scrap are derived using pseudodata generated from a generic process model of the iron and steel industry. The plant level capacities and outputs are used to simulate the process model, and the scrap price is varied to determine the plant level demands for scrap. Furthermore, scrap generation is assumed to be proportional to population and industrial activity distribution. An estimate of the own price elasticity of scrap is then used to derive regional supply functions for scrap. ^ In this study, the market for iron and steel scrap and the interactions by the policy maker are modeled as a bilevel programming problem. The general bilevel programming problem results when the objective function and the decision space of one agent are influenced by other agents. The bilevel programming problem is then reformulated as a single nonlinear complimentarity problem, and solved using a rapidly converging Newton type algorithm. ^ The decision made by the NUCOR corporation to locate in Crawfordsville, Indiana is considered. The results indicate that Crawfordsville is the lowest cost location to NUCOR in the East North Central region, and subsidies by the government and the local electric utility may have been unnecessary. ^ This study also shows that, in the short-run, subsidies are not a cost effective approach to increasing scrap use by the industry. It is unclear how much of this ineffectiveness is due to an inelastic demand for scrap as claimed by previous studies, and how much is due to the imperfect nature of the market, however, the imperfect market is a limiting factor to scrap usage by the industry. ...|$|E
