5|$|In 1989, Roksan {{introduced}} the Artaxerxes phono stage – a moving coil phono pre-amplifier designed to sit inside the turntable. Roksan also marketed a three-legged table {{dedicated to the}} deck. In 1987 Roksan launched the Shiraz moving coil phono cartridge. In 1989, Roksan launched the budget Radius <b>record</b> <b>player,</b> Tabriz arm and Corus moving magnet cartridge.|$|E
5|$|The Roksan Xerxes {{transcription}} turntable (often shortened to Xerxes) is a <b>record</b> <b>player</b> {{named after}} the Persian king Xerxes I and produced by London-based Roksan Audio. Designed by Roksan co-founder, Touraj Moghaddam, the Xerxes is a belt-driven turntable that has a solid plinth. Launched in 1985, the sound quality of the product positioned it as a strong competitor against the established industry leader, the Linn Sondek LP12. Many reviewers use the Xerxes as a reference turntable.|$|E
5|$|A {{new method}} to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM). Rather than using {{a beam of}} light or particles, a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a <b>record</b> <b>player</b> needle. AFM is a promising technique because {{it has the potential to}} image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.|$|E

5|$|Jean-Michel Jarre {{was born}} in Lyon on 24 August 1948, to France Pejot, a French Resistance member and {{concentration}} camp survivor, and composer Maurice Jarre. When Jarre was five, his parents split up and his father moved to America, leaving him with his mother. He did not see his father again until reaching the age of 18. For the first eight years of his life, Jarre spent six months each year at his maternal grandparents' flat on the Cours de Verdun, in the Perrache district of Lyon. Jarre's grandfather was an oboe player, engineer and inventor, designing an early audio mixer used at Radio Lyon. He also gave Jean-Michel his first <b>record</b> <b>player.</b> From his vantage point high above the pavement, the young French boy was able to watch street performers at work, an experience he later cited as proving influential on his art.|$|E
5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom 3 {{includes}} online play using Microsoft's Xbox Live and Sony's PlayStation Network services. Online multiplayer includes ranked matches, where players {{battle to}} increase their rank and ascend the game's leaderboards; player matches, which do not bestow rank and offer options for quick rematches; and player lobbies, which allow up to eight players in a single room {{to compete in a}} king of the hill-style format. When an online match begins, both players can view their opponent's License Card. License Cards keep track of players' tendencies based on fighting style, <b>record</b> <b>player</b> points and total number of wins and losses, and allow players to see the positive and negative points of their play styles. Included among the online features is Shadow Battle, a series of downloadable content packs that allow the player to fight against a team of AI-controlled opponents programmed after the techniques and preferences of Capcom's development staff and famous players from the fighting game community.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, 45rpm-only players that lacked {{speakers}} and plugged into a jack {{on the back}} of a radio were widely available. Eventually, they were replaced by the three–speed <b>record</b> <b>player.</b>|$|E

25|$|Where old disc {{recordings}} {{are considered}} to be of artistic or historic interest, from before the era of tape or where no tape master exists, archivists play back the disc on suitable equipment and record the result, typically onto a digital format, which can be copied and manipulated to remove analog flaws without any further damage to the source recording. For example, Nimbus Records uses a specially built horn <b>record</b> <b>player</b> to transfer 78s. Anyone can do this using a standard <b>record</b> <b>player</b> with a suitable pickup, a phono-preamp (pre-amplifier) and a typical personal computer. However, for accurate transfer, professional archivists carefully choose the correct stylus shape and diameter, tracking weight, equalisation curve and other playback parameters and use high-quality analogue-to-digital converters.|$|E
25|$|Vibraphones {{usually have}} an {{electric}} motor and pulley assembly mounted on {{one side or the}} other to drive the disks in the resonators. The early vibraphones used motors that were intended to power <b>record</b> <b>player</b> turntables, and had limited or no speed adjustment capabilities. Whatever speed adjustments were possible were made by moving the drive belt among a small number of pulleys (usually three) of varying diameters.|$|E
25|$|Speed traps {{are present}} in the game, and players can {{challenge}} each other for the top speed in a given area. Cameras <b>record</b> <b>player</b> times, which can then be shared among rivals. Those rivals can then attempt to beat the shared time. A photography mode is also included. In addition to races, players can search for barn find cars, have them restored, and add them to their car collection.|$|E

25|$|Another {{size and}} format {{was that of}} radio {{transcription}} discs beginning in the 1940s. These records were usually vinyl, 33rpm, and 16inches in diameter. No home <b>record</b> <b>player</b> could accommodate such large records, and they were used mainly by radio stations. They were on average 15 minutes per side and contained several songs or radio program material. These records became less common when tape recorders began being used for radio transcriptions around 1949.|$|E
25|$|The phonograph, <b>record</b> <b>player</b> or {{gramophone}} is {{an instrument}} for recording, reproducing and playing back sounds. The earliest phonographs used cylinders containing an audio recording engraved on the outside surface which could be reproduced when the cylinder was played. Later, the gramophone record with modulated spiral grooves set atop a rotating turntable. The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Alva Edison at his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. On February 8, 1878, Edison was issued the first patent (U.S. patent #200,521) for the phonograph.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{recording}} preceded electrical home reproduction {{because of}} the initial high cost of the new system. In 1925, the Victor company introduced the Orthophonic Victrola, an acoustical <b>record</b> <b>player</b> that was specifically designed to play electrically recorded discs, {{as part of a}} line that also included electrically reproducing Electrolas. The acoustical Orthophonics ranged in price from US$95 to $300, depending on cabinetry; by comparison, the cheapest Electrola cost $650, the price of a new car in an era when clerical jobs paid about $20 a week.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Magnétophone {{contributed to}} Birmingham UK/Italian artist-collaboration-compilation Binary Oppositions {{which was a}} coming {{together}} of visual and audio art produced by Birmingham-based artists. Later that year New York art-house publication Visionaire released an audio media package called Visionaire 53 which brought together many disparate artists in the producing of one-minute-only pieces of music. Magnétophone contributed to this release along with other artists including Yoko Ono, U2, Michael Stipe, Pet Shop Boys, Cindy Sherman and it consisted of five records, 2 cds, a <b>record</b> <b>player</b> and dome container.|$|E
25|$|Between {{midnight and}} 8:00a.m. on June 3, 1961, a {{burglary}} {{occurred at the}} Bay Harbor Pool Room in Panama City, Florida.

Later that day, a witness {{reported that he had}} seen Clarence Earl Gideon in the poolroom at around 5:30 that morning, leaving with a wine bottle and money in his pockets. Based on this accusation alone, the police arrested Gideon and charged him with breaking and entering with intent to commit petty larceny.|$|E

25|$|Westinghouse Electric Corporation built Televox in 1926; {{it was a}} {{cardboard}} cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off. In 1939, the humanoid robot known as Elektro was debuted at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Seven feet tall (2.1 m) and weighing 265 pounds (120.2kg), it could walk by voice command, speak about 700 words (using a 78-rpm <b>record</b> <b>player),</b> smoke cigarettes, blow up balloons, and move its head and arms. The body consisted of a steel gear, cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin. In 1928, Japan's first robot, Gakutensoku, was designed and constructed by biologist Makoto Nishimura.|$|E
25|$|In early 2016, The Temptation of St. Anthony, a small panel long {{attributed}} to the workshop of Hieronymus Bosch, was credited to the painter himself after forensic investigation of its underpainting; it {{was added to the}} ranks of only 25 authenticated Bosch paintings in the world. The Nelson-Atkins also has fine Late Gothic and Early Italian Renaissance paintings by Jacopo del Casentino (The Presentation of Christ in the Temple), Giovanni di Paolo and Workshop, Bernardo Daddi and Workshop, Lorenzo Monaco, Gherardo Starnina (The Adoration of the Magi), and Lorenzo di Credi.

25|$|The {{forensics}} reinforced this theory. On a <b>record</b> <b>player</b> {{atop the}} stack was a thumb-shaped bloodstain.

But {{the blood was}} Rasmussen's, suggesting the equipment had been stacked after the struggle and shooting. They had been left behind, the detectives realized, to make the crime look like something other than what it really was. From the four bound volumes of the case file they developed a list of five women who might be suspects. Nuttall was taken aback when Ruetten told him over the phone that Lazarus was a police officer. By then, Lazarus had been promoted {{to a higher level}} of detective, and was working art theft cases as part of the elite Robbery-Homicide Division (RHD).|$|E
