Marked increments of the luminous efficacy of the lamps were observed by optimizing the structures and the discharge conditions. The {{results showed that the}} xenon gas discharge flat <b>panel</b> <b>lamps</b> with a luminance of above 10, 000 cd/m 2, a luminous flux of above 450 lm, a size of 126 × 87 mm and an luminous efficacy of about 43 lm/W could be attained at about 450 torr xenon, 0. 71 mm gap distance and 2. 8 mm front glass layer thickness. The factors which influenced the luminous efficacy were discussed in the end. ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{accessory}} was {{the remote}} <b>lamp</b> <b>panel</b> Fernlesegerät. For machines {{equipped with the}} extra panel, the wooden case of the Enigma was wider and could store the extra <b>panel.</b> A <b>lamp</b> <b>panel</b> version could be connected afterwards, but that required, as with the Schreibmax, that the <b>lamp</b> <b>panel</b> and lightbulbs be removed. The remote panel {{made it possible for}} a person to read the decrypted plaintext without the operator seeing it.|$|R
