For this reason, in the past years alternative chrome-free tanning processes have been developed.

The crust leather obtained by the oxidative unhairing process showed good physical-mechanical and technical properties comparable with those obtained by the traditional one, and the leather was technically assessed as satisfactory and suitable according to the market request. The actual reduction of the environmental impact of the novel process, in relation with the traditional one, was evaluated performing a Life Cycle Assesment (LCA) using SimaPro 7. 3, one of the most used software for LCA analysis. The results of the life cycle impact assessment underline that damages on main impact categories are greatly reduced through the adoption or the oxidative unhairing.

40|$|Abstract. A tanning process {{based on}} a {{preliminary}} stabilization with glucose, followed by a chromium tannage, has been optimized on semi-industrial scale. A higher chromium content in the tanned leather and a better exhaustion of the floats indicate {{that the presence of}} glucose in the hide improves the penetration and fixation of chromium. The stabilization with glucose allows the production of chromium-free waste shavings that may be reutilized through more sustainable routes. The crust leather obtained is characterized by mechanical and technical properties comparable to those of the traditionally chromium tanned crust leather. As far as roundness, fullness and hand, the glucose stabilized leather display better performances. The results obtained assess the glucose stabilized leather as a good candidate for producing high quality bovine <b>upper</b> <b>leather</b> through a more environmental sound chromium tannage, in terms of lower chromium consumption and discharge in the wastewaters and of better reutilization of chromium-free wastes...|$|R
