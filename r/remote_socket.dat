40|$|Adaptation to {{changing}} environmental conditions {{is a major}} challenge for most distributed applications. The service-oriented programming paradigm leads to an in-creasing number of applications that are not only meant to provide services through standard user-interfaces hosted on desktop computers, but are to be accessible from small mobile devices as well. The integration of the different pro-gramming environments on desktop (i. e.; Windows) and mo-bile computers (i. e.; Java Micro Editions- J 2 ME) puts an extra burden on the programmer {{of this kind of}} applications. In addition, unstable conditions caused by modern infras-tructures for mobile applications and varying properties of computational devices have to be considered during run-time of the application. Dynamic reconfiguration provides a powerful mecha-nism for adaptive computing. Within this paper, we elab-orate on the extension of our previously developed Adap-tive. Net framework towards CORBA and Java. With the in-troduction of new connector types, our framework is able to provide seamless support for adaptive, heterogeneous ap-plications based on. NET, Java, and CORBA. In context of our framework, applications consist of com-ponents which interact via so-called connectors. The com-ponent/connector model allows for mediating between com-ponent frameworks (Java,. NET) as well as between com-munication protocols (CORBA,. NET <b>Remoting,</b> <b>sockets,</b> etc.). Within the paper we give an overview of our adap-tation framework Adaptive. NET, that includes a monitor-ing infrastructure, a reconfiguration platform and tools for building adaptive applications. Using a proof-of-concept application, we experimentally evaluate our connector architecture and study interoper-ability of Java, CORBA, and. NET objects...|$|R

Session types characterise such sessions in terms ofthe types of values communicated {{and the shape}} of protocols, and {{have been developed for}} the p-calculus, CORBA interfaces, and functional languages. Westudy the incorporation of session types into object-oriented languages through MOOSE, a multi-threaded language with session types, thread spawning, iterativeand higher-order sessions. Our design aims to consistently integrate the objectoriented programming style and sessions, {{and to be able to}} treat various case stud-ies from the literature. We describe the design of M OOSE, its syntax, operationalsemantics and type system, and develop a type inference system. After proving subject reduction, we establish the progress property: once a communication hasbeen established, well-typed programs will never starve at communication points. 1 Introduction Object-based communication oriented software is commonly implemented using ei-ther <b>sockets</b> or <b>remote</b> method invocation, such as Java RMI and C # <b>remoting.</b> <b>Sockets</b> provide generally untyped stream abstractions, while remote method invocation offersthe benefits of standard method invocation in a distributed setting. However, both have shortcomings: socket-based code requires a significant amount of dynamic checks andtype-casts on the values exchanged, in order to ensure type safety; remote method invocation does ensure that methods are used as mandated by their type signatures, butdoes not allow programmers to express design patterns frequently arising in distributed applications, where sequences of messages of different types are exchanged through asingle connection following fixed protocols. A natural question is the seamless integration of tractable descriptions of type-safe communication patterns with object-orientedprogramming idioms...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss interprocess {{communication}} in the context of Berkeley UNIX. Special emphasis will be given to those system calls concerned with the creation, management, and use of sockets. There will also be a discussion of signals and selected other system calls that will be useful to those working on the network project assigned for this course. More information on all the system calls mentioned below can be found in the UNIX Programmerâ€™s Manual. Periodic mention will be made of other manual page entries that might be consulted. System header files are designated by enclosing angle brackets; they reside in /usr/include and its subdirectories. 1. Socket Creation The most general mechanism for interprocess communication offered by Berkeley UNIX is the socket. A socket is an endpoint for communication. Two processes can communicate by creating sockets and sending messages between them. There are a variety of different types of sockets, differing in the way the address space of the sockets is defined and the kind of communication that is allowed between sockets. A socket type is uniquely determined by a triple. In order for a <b>remote</b> <b>socket</b> to be reached, it must be possible to assign a name to it. The form that this name assumes is determined by the communication domain or address family to which the socket belongs. There is also an abstract type or style of communication associated with each socket. This dictates the semantics of communication for that socket. Finally, there is a specific protocol that is used wit...|$|E

In this configuration, the switched lamp one live terminal for the night light socket is exposed externally on the base of the socket, to be wired to the <b>remote</b> candelabra <b>socket.</b> Hence, this type of socket has a Hot terminal, a Neutral terminal, and a switched Hot terminal. This creates a confusing situation in which a keyed 3-way socket (which has a 3-contact socket at the top of it) has only two terminal screws, while a night-light socket (which does not have a 3-contact socket at the top) has three terminal screws on the base.|$|R

The cascade control system consists of level and flow as primary and secondary variables, respectively. The web-enabled monitoring and control are realized using three techniques namely <b>remote</b> clientâ€“server, ActiveX-data <b>socket</b> and web publishing tool. Mobile network is established by interfacing the control system with a GSM modem which enables the monitoring of process parameters through mobile phones.

Information is scattered throughout organizations and must be easily accessible. A new solution is needed for effective and efficient management of data in today's distributed client/server environment. Java is destined to become a language for distributed computing. Java Development Kit (JDK) comes with {{a broad range of}} classes for network and database programming. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is one such class for providing client/server database access. There are many different approaches in using JDBC, ranging from low level socket programming, to a more abstract middleware approach. This thesis will analyze three different approaches: <b>Sockets,</b> <b>Remote</b> Method Invocation (RMI) and Commercial Middleware servers. Among the three approaches this thesis examined, database access through RMI is the most viable approach because it uses an effective distributed object model. RMI abstracts the communication interface {{to the level of a}} procedure call.

The Mobile Agent technology is emerging as an alternative to build a smart generation of highly distributed systems. In this work, we investigate the performance aspect of agent-based technologies for information retrieval. We present a comparative performance evaluation model of Mobile Agents versus.

30|$|We use {{repackaging}} {{to design}} malicious IME apps and {{the targets of}} repackaging are the popular third party IME apps. As many IME apps have their own different defenses against repackaging, the difficulty of repackaging on different IME apps is different. Some IME apps just design simple defense which are not difficult to be cracked, and some construct complex solutions which will cost much time to be repackaged. We repackaged three IME apps, one is Sogou IME {{which is the most}} popular third party IME, and the other two are QQ IME and TouchPal IME which are also very popular third party IME apps. We can get the smali code for each app after decompiling the APK file and then add some code in several critical locations in the smali file. For example, as most IME apps use the Android IMF which provides various classes and APIs, we can hook the API commitText to intercept all the user input. The added code is inserted into the location of commitText and the functionality of the added code is to upload each user keystroke to a <b>remote</b> server by <b>socket</b> connections. Finally, the modified code is recompiled, signed and installed in the terminal. After installation, the repackaged IME can be set as the default IME by modifying the system settings. Now we open an app which needs a user to type user name and password, and we find that the entered user name and password are sent to the remote server when the user is typing.|$|R
