In conjunction, a second line (type 100 line) provided quiet termination (cf. loop around). Various types of test lines were called [...] "100", [...] "102", [...] "104" [...] etc. because these numbers accessed the test line in tandem offices in lieu of an area code.|$|E
50|$|AXE10 covers {{two main}} types of digital {{telephony}} switching equipment: the <b>remote</b> <b>subscriber</b> switch (RSS) and the AXE10 local switch. RSS {{acts as a}} remote concentrator and deals with the conversion of analogue telephony signals used in the access network, which is the copper pairs between exchange buildings and customer premises, also called local loop, and the multiplexing of customer lines over cabling to the AXE10 local switching unit. The AXE10 local switch uses a processor-controlled switch to route calls and data depending on the destination of the telephony transmission.|$|E
50|$|Point to Multipoint is {{the most}} popular {{approach}} for wireless communications that have a large number of nodes, end destinations or end users. Point to Multipoint generally assumes there is a central Base Station to which <b>remote</b> <b>Subscriber</b> Units or Customer Premises Equipment, CPE (a term that was originally used in the wired telephone industry) are connected over the wireless medium. Connections between the Base Station and Subscriber Units can be either Line of Sight or for lower-frequency radio systems Non-Line-of-Sight where link budgets permit. Generally, lower frequencies can offer non-Line-of Sight connections. Various software planning tools can be used to determine feasibility of potential connections using topographic data as well as link budget simulation. Often the point to multipoint links are installed to reduce the cost of infrastructure and increase the number of CPE's and connectivity.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the factors that}} are working for and against {{the development of an}} advanced telecommunications infrastructure to serve rural areas of the USA. There is a notable difference between the costs of local network upgrades for existing rural telephone subscribers and of bringing service to new and physically <b>remote</b> <b>subscribers.</b> The latter group should be treated separately for policy purposes. The infrastructure serving the existing subscriber base could be upgraded to a digital network without necessitating large rate increases, provided there is sharing of network facilities between the energy, transportation and telecommunication sectors. The preferred medium is likely to be digital fibre. ...|$|R
40|$|Data feed {{management}} {{is a critical}} component of many data intensive applications that depend on reliable data delivery to support real-time data collection, correlation and analysis. Data is typically collected {{from a wide variety of}} sources and organizations, using a range of mechanisms- some data are streamed in real time, while other data are obtained at regular intervals or collected in an ad hoc fashion. Individual applications are forced to make separate arrangements with feed providers, learn the structure of incoming files, monitor data quality, and trigger any processing necessary. The Bistro data feed manager, designed and implemented at AT&T Labs-Research, simplifies and automates this complex task of data feed management: efficiently handling incoming raw files, identifying data feeds and distributing them to <b>remote</b> <b>subscribers.</b> Bistro supports a flexible specification language to define logical data feeds using the naming structure of physical data files, and to identify feed subscribers. Based on the specification, Bistro matches data files to feeds, performs file normalization and compression, efficiently delivers files, and notifies subscribers using a trigger mechanism. We describe our feed analyzer that discovers the naming structure of incoming data files to detect new feeds, dropped feeds, feed changes, or lost data in an existing feed. Bistro is currently deployed within AT&T Labs and is responsible for the real-time delivery of over 100 different raw feeds, distributing data to several large-scale stream warehouses...|$|R
40|$|An Operational Information System (OIS) {{supports}} a real-time {{view of an}} organization's information critical to its logistical business operations. A central component of an OIS is an engine that integrates data events captured from distributed, remote sources in order to derive meaningful real-time views of current operations. This Event Derivation Engine (EDE) continuously updates these views and also publishes them to a potentially large number of <b>remote</b> <b>subscribers.</b> The paper first describes a sample OIS and EDE {{in the context of}} an airline's operations. It then defines the performance and availability requirements to be met by this system, specifically focusing on the EDE component. One particular requirement for the EDE is that subscribers to its output events should not experience downtime due to EDE failures, crashes or increased processing loads. Toward this end, we develop and evaluate a practical technique for masking failures and for hiding the costs of recovery from EDE subscribers. This technique utilizes redundant EDEs that coordinate view replicas with a relaxed synchronous fault tolerance protocol. A combination of preand post-buffering of replicas is used to attain a solution that offers low response times (i. e., `zero' downtime) while also preventing system failures in the presence of deterministic faults like `ill-formed' messages. Parallelism realized via a cluster machine and application-specific techniques for reducing synchronization across replicas are used to scale a `zero' downtime EDE to support the large number of subscribers it must service...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of IP {{technologies}} and the tremendous growth in data traffic, the wireless industry is evolving its core networks toward IP technology. Enabling wireless Internet access {{is one of the}} upcoming challenges for mobile radio network operators. General Packet Radio Service is the packet-switched extension of GSM and was developed to facilitate access to IP-based services better than existing circuit-switched services provided by GSM. In this article we illustrate how a visited mobile subscriber on a GPRS/UMTS network can access his/her home network via the gateway GPRS support node (GGSN). We also propose some implementation ideas on wireless Internet access for a <b>remote</b> mobile <b>subscriber</b> based on a GPRS/UMTS network...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} to providing full-rate digital subscriber line (xDSL) access to residential customers in rural or remote locations {{is the use of}} existing copper infrastructure. First, copper is not particularly good for moving high frequencies over extended distances. Second, much of the existing copper in the United States is of diminished quality. Third, digital loop carriers, bridge taps, load coils, and ambient interference negatively impact data transmission. Because of these problems, the geographic reach of xDSL services is limited. To combat this limitation, providers are installing <b>remote</b> digital <b>subscriber</b> line access multiplexers (RDSLAMs). RDSLAMs seek to maximise the amount of demand covered for a peripheral neighborhood and aggregate this data traffic onto a fiber optic connection for transport back to the central office (CO) for switching. Although this is more feasible than constructing a new CO, acquiring the rights of way and installing fiber is expensive. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the complexities associated with locating RDSLAMs in a competitive telecommunications market through the use of an integer programming model—the remote access hierarchical assignment problem—and a geographic information system. Pertinent policy and technology related issues in residential broadband deployment and their impacts on high-speed services such as xDSL are highlighted. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} net-centric systems motivate the {{development}} of tactical information management capabilities that ensure the right information is delivered {{to the right place}} at the right time to satisfy quality of service (QoS) requirements in heterogeneous environments. This article presents an architectural overview of the Object Management Group (OMG) ’s Data Distribution Service (DDS), which is a standards-based QoS-enabled datacentric middleware platform that enables applications to communicate by publishing information they have and subscribing to information they need in a timely manner. DDS is an important distributed software technology for mission-critical DoD net-centric systems because it supports (1) location independence, via anonymous publish/subscribe protocols that enable communication between collocated or <b>remote</b> publishers and <b>subscribers,</b> (2) scalability, by supporting large numbers of topics, data readers, and data writers and platform portability and (3) interoperability, via standard interfaces and transport protocols. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Internet Service Providers must {{maintain}} {{the delivery of}} IPv 4 services during the forthcoming IPv 6 transition period. For this purpose, Service Providers are likely to deploy address sharing mechanisms. However, address sharing techniques raise specific {{issues such as the}} difficulty to distinguish unambiguously different hosts sharing the same public IPv 4 address. To mitigate some of the encountered issues, HOST_ID TCP Option has been proposed as a means to reveal the identity of a host when address sharing is deployed by Internet service providers. If no HOST_ID is revealed to <b>remote</b> servers, all <b>subscribers</b> sharing the same IP address will be impacted by a misbehaving user. This paper documents implementation and testing results of HOST_ID TCP Option. Linux kernel and Carrier Grade NAT have been ported to support the ability to inject HOST_ID Options while iptables module has been modified to interpret the information conveyed in HOST_ID and also to enforce dedicated policies. Keywords- address sharing; HOST_ID; TCP Option. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{broadband}} architectures and ISP service profiles to {{show that}} open access is technically feasible and economically viable, even if implementation is not always trivial. The decisive factor is planning. If broadband networks are built with interconnection in mind, {{it will be easier}} to implement open access. Hence, I argue, the FCC should encourage the deployment of open-access-ready networks. Incentives that the FCC can offer at this stage to cable operators to design open access into their networks will have two benefits [...] -they will lower the costs of implementing open access regulations should the FCC decide to act in the future. More significantly, if broadband network operators are encouraged to build open-access-ready networks, they will be better positioned to offer open access on their own, thereby eliminating the need for regulation. Broadband Access Architectures The problem of open access for broadband access networks depends in large part on where a subscriber's traffic first contends with other subscribers' traffic for network resources. There are three locations where contention can first occur: 1. at a carrier aggregation point <b>remote</b> from the <b>subscriber's</b> location (a telephone company central office or a cable company head-end,) 2. on the transmission medium, immediately upon leaving the subscriber's premises, or 3. at some point between the subscriber's location and the carrier's point of presence. The point of first contention is critical to open access because contention means that the network operator must allocate network resources. Which users get what network resources, and when? The open access controversy revolves around this question: whose service provider is making the allocation of resources? Are both users the customers of [...] ...|$|R
