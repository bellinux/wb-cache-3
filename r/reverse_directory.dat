5000|$|Early in {{the evening}} of January 15, 1989, a New York Telephone {{operator}} {{received a call from}} a woman in distress. When the call was abruptly disconnected, she alerted police, but they found nothing because the <b>reverse</b> <b>directory</b> had an incorrect address. At 11:42pm, the body of Betty Jeanne Solomon was found in the family's Greenburgh condominium by her husband. She had been pistol-whipped about the head and had nine bullet wounds in her back and legs. The investigation initially focused on Paul Solomon, whose alibi was he had stopped briefly at a local bowling alley to see friends and then spent the evening with Warmus at the Treetops Lounge in the Holiday Inn in Yonkers. When Warmus and additional witnesses confirmed his story, detectives turned their attention elsewhere, as did Solomon, who broke off his relationship with Warmus and became involved with a new girlfriend, Barbara Ballor. Police suspicions shifted to Warmus when she began to relentlessly pursue Solomon, including following him and Ballor to Puerto Rico and calling the woman's family in an effort to end the relationship. When investigators gained information that Warmus had obtained a [...]25 caliber Beretta pistol with a silencer shortly before the murder, Detective Richard Constantino checked calls made from Warmus' home phone on January 15. He discovered one made at 3:02pm was to Ray’s Sport Shop in North Plainfield, New Jersey. The store's records indicated the only female to purchase [...]25-caliber ammunition that day was Liisa Kattai from Long Island. When questioned, Kattai denied ever being in the shop or buying ammunition. Further investigation determined that Kattai's driver's license had been lost or stolen while she was employed at a summer job, where one of her co-workers was Warmus. Police now had enough evidence to make an arrest.|$|E
40|$|Names {{are common}} in most text-to-speech applications, such as {{automatic}} reading of newspapers, <b>reverse</b> <b>directory</b> services and voice communication aids. The letter-tosound rules included in these applications often cannot handle names, since the rules usually are designed for ordinary words. The structure of Swedish names differs from ordinary Swedish words- but their multi-morphemic structure makes them suitable to analyse with a morphological analyser. A study {{of the structure of}} Swedish names in the Swedish telephone directory is presented in this thesis. The thesis also presents the work done within the Swedish part of a European Linguistics Research and Engineering project, called the Onomastica project. The aim of this project was to produce a multi-lingual pronunciation dictionary for names occurring in 11 European languages, as well as developing techniques for automatic transcription of names. The speech communication group at KTH has developed a system where a morphology analyser is used together with a set of context dependent rules to transcribe ordinary Swedish words. This thesis describes the work done to extend thi...|$|E
40|$|Strategies {{involving}} 14 {{sources were}} used to locate 230 parents of {{sudden infant death syndrome}} infants who died in Southern California between 1989 and 1992 and 255 parents of healthy, living infants matched by birth hospital, birth date, race, and sex. The sample consisted of adults of reproductive age residing in Southern California. After an event of sudden infant death, many parents moved without a forwarding address; only their names, last known address, and the infant's race, birth date, and sex were available. There was no access to birth certificates, obstetric or pediatric medical records, parents ' Social Security numbers, or parents ' birth dates. The most successful tracking sources for case parents were the Department of Motor Vehicles, postal service, <b>reverse</b> <b>directory</b> and neighbors, private investigator, and California Medicaid ser-vices. For control parents, the post office, Department of Motor Vehicles, and Folks Finders proved the most helpful. Using a combination of the 14 sources achieved an adequate sample size.

50|$|A <b>reverse</b> {{telephone}} <b>directory</b> (also {{known as}} a gray pages directory, criss-cross <b>directory</b> or <b>reverse</b> phone lookup) {{is a collection of}} telephone numbers and associated customer details. However, unlike a standard telephone directory, where the user uses customer's details (such as name and address) in order to retrieve the telephone number of that person or business, a <b>reverse</b> telephone <b>directory</b> allows users to search by a telephone service number in order to retrieve the customer details for that service.|$|R
5000|$|As {{cellular}} phones become more popular, {{there has been}} debate about releasing cell phone numbers into public 411 and <b>reverse</b> number <b>directories.</b> (S. 1963, the [...] "Wireless 411 Privacy Act" [...] 9/2004). However, opposition led by leading consumer-protection organization Consumers Union presented several privacy concerns in their congressional testimony. Right now, cell phone numbers are not available in any public 411 or reverse-number directories. However, several information companies provide reverse cell phone lookups that are obtained from utility resources, and are available online. Because there is no central database of cell phone numbers, <b>reverse</b> phone <b>directories</b> that claim to be free cannot return information on those numbers.|$|R

Some forms of city directories provide this form of lookup for listed services by phone number, along with address cross-referencing.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, the <b>Directory</b> <b>reversed</b> the policy of obligatory and free education for all, largely {{because of the lack of}} money to pay teachers. The Directory began to create a system of central schools, with the goal of one in each department, which boys could attend from the age of twelve, with a full curriculum of sciences, history and literature. The state paid a part of the cost, while each student also paid the professor a fee. The new schools had libraries (mostly confiscated from the nobility), small botanical gardens, and museums of natural history. For the first time in French schools, French instead of Latin was the basis of education. Three of these schools were organized in Paris; two of them later became the famous Lycée Henri-IV and Lycée Charlemagne. But by the end of the Directory there were only 992 students in the three Paris schools.|$|R
