6000|$|The engineer-in-chief, who was Edwin Gurwood's superior, had {{charge of}} the entire railway, which was {{something}} over one thousand miles in extent. This vast line was divided into four divisions--namely, the northern, southern, western, and eastern; each division being under the superintendence of a resident engineer, who was, of course, subject to the engineer-in-chief. Each division was about 250 miles long, and was subdivided into districts varying from thirty to seventy miles. These were under the charge of inspectors, whose duty it was to travel constantly over their lengths--almost daily--partly on foot and partly by train, {{to see that the}} line was kept in perfect working order. The travelling inspectors had under them a large body of [...] "surface-men" [...] or [...] "plate-layers," [...] men whose duty it was to perform the actual work of keeping the line in order. They worked in squads of four or five--each squad having a foreman or gaffer, who was held responsible for the particular small portion of the line that he and his squad had to attend to. The average number of surface-men was about two to the mile--so that the entire staff of these men on the line numbered over two thousand. Their business was to go over the entire line twice a day, drive tight the wooden [...] "keys" [...] which held the rails in their chairs, lift and re-lay broken or worn-out rails and chairs, raise or depress sleepers wherever these required alteration, so as to make the line level, and, generally, to keep in thorough repair the [...] "permanent way." [...] Again, each of the four divisions had an inspector of signals and an inspector of buildings, the former being responsible for the perfect working order of all signals, and the latter, who had a few masons, joiners, slaters, blacksmiths, and others under him, having charge of all the stations, sheds, and other buildings on the line. Every month each division engineer sent in to the head office a statement of material used, and of work done; also a <b>requisition</b> <b>for</b> <b>material</b> required <b>for</b> future use.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA computer model which simulates {{the processing of}} <b>requisitions</b> <b>for</b> standard stock <b>material</b> at NSC San Diego is constructed. The model is designed to enable NSC San Diego to determine those work stations which are bottlenecks and to view the effects of changes in total throughput time caused by changes in manpower resources and administrative procedures. Output from the computer simulation model includes an analysis of throughput time by issue priority group, and summary data on work center utilizations and delay times. Total throughput time is compared to Uniform Material Movement and Issue Priority System time standards. The automated materials handling system seems to achieve its goals; however large delays are seen {{to occur in the}} staging area where items await local transportation. These delays are reflected most critically in the statistics for the percentage of issue priority group two material shipped on time. Variations of the basic model were analyzed. The combination of a six day workweek and an increased local delivery schedule resulted in substantial improvement. [URL] Commander, United States NavyMajor, United States Arm...|$|R

50|$|Holland {{completed}} his drama {{training at the}} Labour Stage in London. Shortly after, he was called into His Majesty's Armed Forces as a signalman {{at the onset of}} the Second World War. While training at the coastal town of South Shields, he put on a play in a local abandoned theatre. Holland continued to mount productions in his spare time throughout the course of the war. He was granted the officers' lounge for rehearsals and cast approximately 100 men in a wide variety of roles, including parts that required playing women. His plays continued through the North African Campaign, crossed the desert, and made it to Cairo where he would mount productions at the Khedivial Opera House. So successful were his plays that the military <b>requisitioned</b> stage <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> more elaborate productions. Holland was transferred into military intelligence where he served out the remainder of the war.|$|R
