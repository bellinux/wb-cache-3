25|$|Commonly held beliefs {{regarding}} {{the destruction of}} the castle were that it was bombarded by cannon fire from the hillside opposite during the Civil War, or that it was destroyed by a huge fire after being struck by lightning.

25|$|As a {{first step}} towards realizing a Two Stage To Orbit (TSTO) fully <b>re-usable</b> launch vehicle, a series of {{technology}} demonstration missions have been conceived. For this purpose, a Winged Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD) has been configured. The RLV-TD will act as a flying test bed to evaluate various technologies viz., hypersonic flight, autonomous landing, powered cruise flight and hypersonic flight using air-breathing propulsion. First in the series of demonstration trials is the hypersonic flight experiment (HEX).|$|E

King Camp Gillette, a {{traveling}} hardware salesman of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin invented the double-edged, disposable safety razor attached to a <b>re-usable</b> razor handle. Beforehand, dull razors were taken to barbers for sharpening. With Gillette's double-edged and disposable blades, a uniform shave on a man's face could be achieved with a fresh blade and disposed after it was used. Gillette applied for a patent in 1901. It was granted in 1904.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{reasons for}} using lead are its {{relatively}} low melting point and cost {{compared to other}} high density materials. It is also resistant to corrosion in fresh and salt water. Most dive weights are cast by foundries and sold by dive shops to divers {{in a range of}} sizes, but some are made by divers for their own use. Scrap lead from sources such as fishing sinkers and wheel balance weights can be easily cast by a hobbyist in relatively cheap <b>re-usable</b> moulds, though this exposes them to vaporized lead fumes.|$|E
25|$|Helical railguns are {{multi-turn}} railguns {{that reduce}} rail and brush current {{by a factor}} equal {{to the number of}} turns. Two rails are surrounded by a helical barrel and the projectile or <b>re-usable</b> carrier is also helical. The projectile is energized continuously by two brushes sliding along the rails, and two or more additional brushes on the projectile serve to energize and commute several windings of the helical barrel direction in front of and/or behind the projectile. The helical railgun is a cross between a railgun and a coilgun. They do not currently exist in a practical, usable form.|$|E
25|$|Legal writing values precedent, as {{distinct}} from authority. Precedent means the way things have been done before. For example, a lawyer who must prepare a contract and who has prepared a similar contract before will often re-use, with limited changes, the old contract for the new occasion. Or a lawyer who has filed a successful motion to dismiss a lawsuit may use the same or a very similar form of motion again in another case, and so on. Many lawyers use and re-use written documents in this way and call these <b>re-usable</b> documents templates or, less commonly, forms.|$|E

Dinky Toys pioneered the manufacture of die-cast toys with the production of toy cars, trains and ships and model train sets became popular in the 1920s. The Britain's company revolutionized the production of toy soldiers with {{the invention of the}} process of hollow casting in lead in 1893 – the company's products remained the industry standard for many years.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was an Ilyushin Il-76, a large Russian-built cargo aircraft. Registered as EW-78849, the Il-76 {{had been}} on a chartered cargo flight carrying equipment to Ugandan AMISOM peacekeepers in the Somali capital of Mogadishu. All of the crew members were Belarusian. Four of the personnel on board the accident aircraft were engineers who had worked on repairing another aircraft of the same type that had been the subject of an attempted shootdown 14 days earlier. Much of the equipment on board EW-78849 was for repairing the aircraft damaged earlier; the rest of the cargo was humanitarian aid. The first aircraft was still crippled at the departure time of EW-78849, and TransAVIAexport were considering whether to cannibalise it for <b>re-usable</b> parts.|$|E
25|$|The {{cassette}} {{was adapted}} {{into what is}} called a streamer cassette, a version dedicated solely for data storage, and used chiefly for hard disk backups and other types of data. Streamer cassettes look almost exactly the same as a standard cassette, with the exception of having a notch about one quarter-inch wide and deep situated slightly off-center at the top edge of the cassette. Streamer cassettes also have a <b>re-usable</b> write-protect tab on only one side of the top edge of the cassette, with {{the other side of the}} top edge having either only an open rectangular hole, or no hole at all. This is due to the entire one-eighth inch width of the tape loaded inside being used by a streamer cassette drive for the writing and reading of data, hence only one side of the cassette being used. Streamer cassettes can hold anywhere from 50 to 160 megabytes of data.|$|E

2500|$|However by 1083 the Song {{court was}} {{producing}} {{hundreds of thousands}} of fire arrows for their garrisons. Bombs and fire lances became prominent during the 12th century and were used by the Song during the Jin-Song Wars. The first proto-guns, known as [...] "fire lances", were first recorded to have been used at the siege of De'an in 1132 by Song forces against the Jin. In the early 13th century the Jin utilized iron casing bombs. Projectiles were added to fire lances, <b>re-usable</b> fire lance barrels were developed, first out of hardened paper, and then metal. By 1257 some fire lances were firing wads of bullets. In the late 13th century metal fire lances became 'eruptors,' proto-cannons firing co-viative projectiles, and by 1287 at the latest, had become true guns, the hand cannon.|$|E
2500|$|An {{integrated}} gasification {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) is {{a technology that}} uses a high pressure gasifier to turn coal and other carbon based fuels into pressurized gas—synthesis gas (syngas). It can then remove impurities from the syngas prior to the power generation cycle. Some of these pollutants, such as sulfur, {{can be turned into}} <b>re-usable</b> byproducts through the Claus process. This results in lower emissions of sulfur dioxide, particulates, mercury, and in some cases carbon dioxide. With additional process equipment, a water-gas shift reaction can increase gasification efficiency and reduce carbon monoxide emissions by converting it to carbon dioxide. [...] The resulting carbon dioxide from the shift reaction can be separated, compressed, and stored through sequestration. Excess heat from the primary combustion and syngas fired generation is then passed to a steam cycle, similar to a combined cycle gas turbine. This process results in improved thermodynamic efficiency compared to conventional pulverized coal combustion.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{contribution}} to smallpox vaccination {{was made in}} the 1960s by Benjamin Rubin, an American microbiologist working for Wyeth Laboratories. Based on initial tests with textile needles with the eyes cut off transversely half-way he developed the bifurcated needle. This was a sharpened two-prong fork designed to hold one dose of reconstituted freeze-dried vaccine by capillarity. Easy to use with minimum training, cheap to produce ($5 per 1000), using 4 times less vaccine than other methods, and repeatedly <b>re-usable</b> after flame sterilization, it was used globally in the WHO Smallpox Eradication Campaign from 1968. Rubin estimated that it was used to do 200 million vaccinations per year during the last years of the campaign. Those closely involved in the campaign were awarded the [...] "Order of the Bifurcated Needle". This, a personal initiative by Donald Henderson, was a lapel badge, designed and made by his daughter, formed from the needle shaped to form an [...] "O".
