25|$|The Lansing Chapman hockey rink, {{built in}} 1953 and {{originally}} uncovered, was canopied in 1963, enclosed in 1969 {{and has been}} periodically upgraded to the present (2014) with rink, <b>roof,</b> <b>locker</b> room and lighting improvements.|$|E
5000|$|Known {{simply by}} one name (although {{acknowledged}} as Greensboro Coliseum Fieldhouse), the Fieldhouse is a standalone exhibition hall {{adjacent to the}} Special Events Center. The 30,000 sq ft space opened in March 2003 as the [...] "GCC Pavilion". The project was designed by Sutton-Kennerly Associates. In 2016, the Fieldhouse became {{the home of the}} Greensboro Swarm, the NBA Development League (later called the NBA G League) affiliate of the Charlotte Hornets. To accommodate the team the Fieldhouse was renovated with a permanent <b>roof,</b> <b>locker</b> room, and seating for 2,118.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 {{the country}} club {{expanded}} and renovated the snack bar building, renovated the locker room building exterior, constructed a large array of solar panels on the <b>roof</b> of the <b>locker</b> room and dining facility building, and performed other renovations. Replacing the golf house's location, a pool facility and tennis shop was constructed in 1968.|$|R
50|$|Lockers {{are usually}} {{physically}} joined together {{side by side}} in banks, and are commonly made from steel, although wood, laminate, and plastic are other materials sometimes found. Steel lockers which are banked together share side walls, and are constructed by starting with a complete locker; further lockers may then be adding by constructing the floor, roof, rear wall, door, and just one extra side wall, the existing side wall of the previous locker serving as the other side wall of the new one. The walls, floors, and <b>roof</b> of <b>lockers</b> may be either riveted together (the more traditional method) or, more recently, welded together.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1980, Mercedes {{offered the}} NG trucks {{with a new}} range of engines from 95 kW/130 hp to 276 kW/375 hp. This {{generation}} can be recognized by wind deflectors fitted to the lower front corners of the cabs. In addition, the horizontal chrome bar on the grill was dropped. Model badges and mirror casings were now black. The chassis on semi-trailer tractors was redesigned, lowering it by 120 mm. A fourth cab variant above the L-Fahrerhaus, the GR-Fahrerhaus now was a true long-distance cabin with a raised <b>roof</b> and wardrobe <b>locker.</b> This cab was also wider than the others, noticeable by the flush wheel arches, and {{no longer had a}} rear left side window nor rear windows.|$|R
6000|$|No {{structure}} of this elaborate and expensive sort {{would have been}} set up by my father, for the miller's convenience. The boat-house had been built, many years since, by a rich retired tradesman with a mania for aquatic pursuits. Our ugly river had not answered his expectations, and our neighborhood had abstained from returning his visits. When he left us, with his wherries and canoes and outriggers, the miller took possession of the abandoned boat-house. [...] "It's the sort of fixture that don't pay nohow," [...] old Toller remarked. [...] "Suppose you remove it--there's a waste of money. Suppose you knock it to pieces--is it worth a rich gentleman's while to sell a cartload of firewood?" [...] Neither of these alternatives having been adopted, and nobody wanting an empty boat-house, the clumsy mill boat, hitherto tied to a stake, and exposed to the worst that the weather could do to injure it, was now snugly sheltered under a <b>roof,</b> with empty <b>lockers</b> (once occupied by aquatic luxuries) gaping on either side of it.|$|R
