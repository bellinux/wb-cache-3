50|$|Evidence of mercantilistic {{practices}} {{appeared in}} early modern Venice, Genoa, and Pisa regarding {{control of the}} Mediterranean trade of bullion. However, as a codified school of economic theories, mercantilism's <b>real</b> <b>birth</b> was marked by the empiricism of the Renaissance, which first began to quantify large-scale trade accurately.|$|R
50|$|Birth {{rate and}} desired birth rates {{are thought to}} have a {{different}} factors. Because of its nature of relating with psychology the factors that move desired birth rates are lifestyle, religion and culture.

50|$|It is {{commonly}} said that Solbi {{was born in}} 1983. This is because {{there had been a}} misunderstanding while filing her birth certificate, which states that she was born in 1983, while her <b>real</b> <b>birth</b> date is 1984, which she confirms on a talk show with her mother. Also, her legal name was changed to Kwon Ji-Ahn in 2008.|$|R
50|$|It {{was just}} that year when, along with six other teams, the taurinos became pioneers by {{founding}} the National Association Pro Football (ANAPROF), and play a national championship. That would {{be the basis for}} the <b>real</b> <b>birth</b> of Panamanian football, which at that time painted little in the regional panorama and which, two decades later, is one of the lighthouses of the Central American area.|$|R
50|$|She {{went to the}} United States on 28 December 1907, in {{steerage}} on the S. S. La Provence.

She was 22 on the ship's passenger list when she arrived in the United States in 1907. She went first to Reno, Nevada, where her father had reportedly settled previously.|$|R
50|$|In post {{war years}} Löhndorff joined the French Foreign Legion. Why {{he did so}} remains unclear. He may have done so due to {{financial}} problems or simply to follow his urge for adventures. On 13 November 1920 he signed in for five years in Saarbrücken, using the false name “Ernesto de Naca e Villaverde” and false birthplace Veracruz, but giving his <b>real</b> <b>birth</b> date of 13 March 1899.|$|R

50|$|William Muldoon {{died at age}} 81 in Westchester County, New York, and was interred in a grandiose private {{mausoleum}} at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.

The rest even of her own attendants only understood me to be a Scottish orphan. My true lineage should never have been known, were it not a daughter's duty to plead for her mother." ...|$|R

50|$|In 1838, the Empress of Russia {{was honored}} with a Schuhplattler by the {{residents}} of the bath town of Wildbad Kreuth, and the aristocracy, fascinated by the strange costumes and quaint pursuits of the common folk, began taking an interest in the dance. Many consider the <b>real</b> <b>birth</b> of the modern Schuhplattler, however, to be Bavarian King Maximilian's excursion through the Alps in 1858, when locals performed the dance for him, and {{he fell in love with}} it.|$|R
50|$|On March 10, 2014, he {{announced}} that his <b>real</b> <b>birth</b> name is Lee Hodong, not Howon as he had previously told the public, and that he changed it {{in order not to}} share a name with comedian Kang Hodong.

60|$|Daily--more than daily--did she and Cicely go over {{together}} that hurried {{conversation on the}} moor, and try to guess whether Langston intended to hint at Cicely's <b>real</b> <b>birth.</b> He had certainly not disclosed her secret as yet, or Paulett would never have selected her as sprung of a loyal house, but he might guess at the truth, and be waiting {{for an opportunity to}} sell it dearly to those who would regard her as possessed of dangerous pretensions.|$|R
60|$|So Aveline {{made her}} {{preparations}} accordingly, and began by arranging that the equerry should lose {{himself in the}} forest, after which she took away the king's sword and his horse while he lay asleep under a tree.

5000|$|In 1946, {{under the}} name Clementina Dinah Campbell, Laine married George Langridge, a roof tiler, {{with whom she had}} a son, Stuart. The couple {{divorced}} in 1957. It was not until 1953, when she was 26 and applying for a passport for a forthcoming tour of Germany, that Laine found out her <b>real</b> <b>birth</b> name, due to her parents not being married at the time and her mother registering her under her own name. Her early influences as a singer were Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Lena Horne ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, {{during the}} dispute {{regarding}} President Obama's birth certificate, Scott said that Obama {{was not born}} in the United States. Scott added: [...] "I was born here. If someone accuses me of not being born here, I can go - within 10 minutes - to my filing cabinet and I can pick up my <b>real</b> <b>birth</b> certificate and I can go, 'See? Look! Here it is.

40|$|<b>Real</b> <b>birth</b> {{intervals}} {{are traditionally}} examined {{only in the}} longitudinal approach and in the relation to cohorts and generations. Nevertheless it seems justified to make sometimes several queries: 1) what is the time lag between the birth in a given calendar year a of {{a child of the}} p-sequence and the previous birth p— l, 2) how much time must pass between the birth p-sequence child na given calendar year a and the p+ 1 child born later. Such an exposition of the problem seems interesting from at least one point of view: a possibility of analysing the effect of various historical events, related closely to the defined time span, on the length of <b>real</b> <b>birth</b> intervals. Such historical events are war, economic crisis, epidemic of pest, new regulation of abortion. All those events can prolong or shorten the type 1 and 2 intervals in the succeeding calendar years. Currently, frome one year to another, only the type 1 intervals can be traced, while the calculation of the type 2 intervals takes theoretically approximately 30 years, untili the youngest of generations will complete its period of fertility. In practice that period can be substantially shortened. Those problems are not encountered in relation to the deceased populations reconstructed on the grounds of parish registers.

50|$|Pixinguinha died in 1973 in the Church of Nossa Senhora da Paz in Ipanema while {{attending}} a baptism. He {{was buried in}} the Cemitério de Inhaúma. The day which was believed to be his birthday, April 23, is today commemorated as the National Day of Choro in Brazil. The day was officially established in 2000 after a campaign by bandolim player Hamilton de Holanda and his students at the Raphael Rabello School of Choro. In November 2016, however, it was discovered that Pixinguinha's <b>real</b> <b>birth</b> date was May 4, and not April 23. Despite that, Brazil's National Day of Choro remained unaltered.|$|R
50|$|Greek initiates were {{strongly}} present in Alexandria, {{in the latest}} period of Egyptian history known as the Ptolemaic period. They brought with them the Greek initiatic system of the Mysteries, which was then incorporated by the ancient Egyptian priests into their traditions, thereby giving a new, coherent structure to the same. According to Ordo Aurum Solis and its initiates, this was the <b>real</b> <b>birth</b> of the Hermetic Theurgic Tradition, later {{to be known as}} the Ogdoadic Tradition, or Ordo Aurum Solis. As Sumerian and Egyptian magic also found their place in the clear system of the ancient Greek Mysteries, the Western initiatic tradition was born.|$|R

Marx), that his press materials had long said, purposely, {{that he had been}} born in 1928, but he planned to come clean about his <b>real</b> <b>birth</b> date. As a teenager, Franklin [...] "followed around" [...] Al Jolson and Eddie Cantor, the latter of whom eventually began buying jokes from the young Franklin and whose Carnegie Hall show he later produced.|$|R
60|$|Cicely {{went away}} full of that {{undefined}} discomfort experienced by generous young spirits when their elders, more worldly-wise (or foolish), fail even {{to comprehend the}} purity or loftiness of motive which they themselves thoroughly believe. Yet, though she had infinitely more faith in Humfrey's affection than she had in that of Babington, she had {{not by any means}} the same dread of being used to bait the hook for him, partly because she knew his integrity too well to expect to shake it, and partly because he was perfectly aware of her <b>real</b> <b>birth,</b> and could not be gulled with such delusive hopes as poor Antony might once have been.|$|R
