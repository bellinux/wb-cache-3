The {{investigation}} of the stability of longitudinal motion of fixed wing aircraft in ground proximity presented here focuses on rectangular wing and tail configurations {{similar to that of}} the Piper Cherokee PA- 28 - 180. The majority of our results pertain to the height range down to one quarter of the wing span, and th main objectives of the investigation were the following: to <b>reveal</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>nature</b> and causes of the instability encountered in the close ground proximity; to assess the influence the design parameters such as the centre of the mass placement, tail length, tail height and wing aspect ration have on the stability of longitudinal motion; and to suggest a feedback control strategy that would alleviate the instability...|$|E
40|$|Brillouin {{scattering}} based {{fibre optic}} sensors have been actively researched {{over the past}} decade due to their enhanced sensitivity to environmental parameters such as temperature and strain. Applications range from dynamic health monitoring of civil structures such as bridges, pipelines, and nuclear reactors to real-time threshold applications such as fire detection. As temperature and strain changes often represent the first symptoms of structural degradation, the development of Brillouin scattering based technology will bear considerable scientific as well as economic benefit. Brillouin sensors employing the probe-pump amplification technique obtain distributed spatial information along a fibre using narrow pulses. In this study, the impact of pulse width and extinction ratio on the overall Brillouin spectrum shape is investigated. From independent theoretical and experimental investigations, a comprehensive curve fitting method is proposed to <b>reveal</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>nature</b> of Brillouin scattering in the transient regime...|$|E
40|$|The {{ground state}} {{properties}} of the high spin Heisenberg chains with alternating single site anisotropy are investigated {{by means of the}} numerical exact daigonaization and DMRG method. It is found that the ferrimagnetic state appears between the Haldane phase and period doubled Néel phase for the integer spin chains. On the other hand, the transition from the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state into the ferrimagnetic state takes place for the half-odd-integer spin chains. In the ferrimagnetic phase, the spontaneous magnetization varies continuously with the modulation amplitude of the single site anisotropy. Eventually, the magnetization is locked to fractional values of the saturated magnetization. These fractional values satisfy the Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck condition. The local spin profile is calculated to <b>reveal</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>nature</b> of each state.

40|$|Crack {{initiation}} and propagation in a nanostructured nickel film {{were studied}} by {{molecular dynamic simulation}} {{as well as an}} interatomic-potential-based continuum approach. In the molecular dynamic simulation, the interatomic potential was described by using Embedded Atom Method (EAM), and a reduced 2 D plane model was employed to simulate the mechanical behavior of nanofilms. Atomistic simulation shows that the reduced plane model in this paper can not only <b>reveal</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>nature</b> of crack initiation clearly but also give the critical time of crack initiation accurately as the continuum fracture analysis does. The normal stress and average atom energy at the crack tip which resulted from atomistic simulation at the time of crack initiation agree well with the analytical results. On the other hand, the crack propagation in nanofilms was studied by interatomic-potential-based continuum fracture mechanics analysis based on Griffith criterion. The coupled continuum-atomic analysis can predict the crack initiation and atomic stress accurately. Continuum analysis with material property parameters determined by interatomic potential is proved to be another promising way of solving failure problem on nanoscale...|$|E
40|$|The {{character}} of multi-offset reflections {{from the deep}} crust in the Mojave Desert are examined to <b>reveal</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>nature</b> of the reflecting structures. We focus on distinguishing classical abrupt discontinuities, such as traditional models of the Conrad and Moho boundaries, from more unusual structures. Finite-difference modeling and simple interference relations show that pre-critical reflections exhibiting an increase in peak frequency with offset arise from thinly-layered horizontal structures, while reflections from step discontinuities show no change in frequency with offset. In the deep crust thin layers may result from sill intrusion or fault motion. The sense of changes in Poisson's ratio and the relative strength of density changes determine whether reflection amplitudes will increase or decrease with offset. A simple linear regression on pre-critical reflection amplitudes against offset is adequate to separate reflections arising from increases in Poisson's ratio from those arising from decreases in Poisson's ratio and/or density changes. The latter condition {{may be the result}} of strong anisotropy or the presence of pore fluid. Comparisons of the properties of major deep reflectors across the Mojave Desert suggest that the effects of tectonic motion and fluid injection have penetrated all levels of the crust. ...|$|E

The main programmes of the research works were the sounding rocket experiments for auroral studies, the inland traverse for the glaciological, geological, geodesical and meteorological studies and the coastal traverse for the geomorphological and geochemical studies. Seven S- 210 JA type rockets were fired off at Syowa Station in 1973. Objects of measurements were electron and ion densities, electric and magnetic fields, infrared emissions, auroral X-rays and radiowaves in aurora. Through the successful rocket flights, significant information to <b>reveal</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>nature</b> of auroras was obtained. The inland traverse party made a 85 -day trip from 10 November 1973 to 2 February 1974 covering about 1, 500 km in the Mizuho Plateau and Yamato Mountains area. The main object was the remeasurement of the triangular strain grid band along the parallel of 72 °S set by the 10 th expedition in 1969, for investigating the movement of the ice sheet. During the trip, the geodesical and geological surveys around the Yamato Mountains were also carried out. The coastal party for the geomorphological study traversed more than 3, 000 km on the sea ice around the southeastern part of Liitzow-Holm Bay.

Among all the complexes studied, only 1 and 2 show large U-cal (computed energy barrier for magnetization reorientation) values of 256. 4 and 268. 5 cm(- 1), respectively and this is in accordance with experiment. Experimentally only frequency dependent chi" tails are observed for complex 1 a and our calculation predicts a large U(cal) of 229. 4 cm(- 1) for this molecule. Besides these, none of the complexes (3, 4, 2 a, 3 a and 4 a) computed to possess large energy barrier and this is affirmed by the experiments. These observed differences in the magnetic properties are correlated to the Ln-Ligand bonding. Our calculations transpire comparatively improved Single-Ion Magnet (SIM) behaviour for carbene analogues due to the more axially compressed trigonal prismatic ligand environment.

These eddies spread almost to the bottom (Kamenkovich et al. 1986). However, the existence of similar oceanic eddies in the Indian Ocean, and the question whether such eddies are typical for the ocean as a whole remained open. In 1959 and 1960, John Swallow the British oceanographer measured the currents in the Sargasso Sea at the depths of 2000 and 4000  m using neutral buoyancy floats that he constructed.

Doppler emissions from stable circular orbits of neutral hydrogen clouds in the halo allow the measurement of tangential velocity vtg(r) of the clouds treated as probe particles. According to Newton’s laws, centrifugal acceleration v 2 tg /r should balance the gravitational attraction GM(r) /r 2, which immediately gives v 2 tg = GM(r) /r.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} and <b>reveal</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>nature</b> of the reversed granulation pattern in the solar photosphere by means of 3 -dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations. We used the MURaM code to obtain a realistic model of the near-surface layers of the convection zone and the photosphere. The pattern of horizontal temperature fluctuations {{at the base of}} the photosphere consists of relatively hot granular cells bounded by the cooler intergranular downflow network. With increasing height in the photosphere, the amplitude of the temperature fluctuations diminishes. At a height of z= 130 - 140 km in the photosphere, the pattern of horizontal temperature fluctuations reverses so that granular regions become relatively cool compared to the intergranular network. Detailed analysis of the trajectories of fluid elements through the photosphere reveal that the motion of the fluid is non-adiabatic, owing to strong radiative cooling when approaching the surface of optical depth unity followed by reheating by the radiation field from below. The temperature structure of the photosphere results from the competition between expansion of rising fluid elements and radiative heating. The former acts to lower the temperature of the fluid whereas the latter acts to increase it towards the radiative equilibrium temperature with a net entropy gain. After the fluid overturns and descends towards the convection zone, radiative energy loss again decreases the entropy of the fluid. Radiative heating and cooling of fluid elements that penetrate into the photosphere and overturn do not occur in equal amounts. The imbalance in the cumulative heating and cooling of these fluid elements is responsible for the reversal of temperature fluctuations with respect to height in the photosphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{presented in}} this study demonstrate that there exist at least two functional epitopes on an I-A molecule that can be recognized by T cell clones. By comparing the abilities of spleen cells from C 57 BL/ 6 mice and the congenic I-A mutant line B 6. C-H- 2 bm 12 to stimulate alloreactive T cell clones specific for the I-Ab molecule, we have discriminated two sets of clones, those recognizing the I-Ab and I- Abm 12 molecule equally well and those able to recognize only the I-Ab molecule. These results imply that {{the two sets of}} clones have different receptors for I-A and that they therefore recognize separate epitopes on the I-A molecule. We have similarly been able to separate T cell clones, both alloreactive and L-glutamic acid 60 -L-alanine 30 -L- tyrosine 10 -reactive, specific for the Ab alpha Ak beta hybrid molecule into two groups based on their ability to recognize bm 12 spleen cells. Although the recognition of bm 12 spleen cells by these clones was unexpected since none of them responds to B 6 spleen cells, these data again allow us to conclude that these groups of clones have different receptors for the same I-A molecule and therefore that they recognize distinct epitopes on the molecule. Additional studies, in which monoclonal anti-I-A antibodies were used to block the stimulation of T cells by stimulator or antigen-presenting cells, have demonstrated that this blockade can be a steric effect and therefore is not necessarily indicative of direct competition between the antibody and the T cell for the same site on an I-A molecule.

40|$|Context. Historically, supergiant (sg) B[e] {{stars have}} been {{difficult}} to include in theoretical schemes for the evolution of massive OB stars. Aims. The location of Wd 1 - 9 within the coeval starburst cluster Westerlund 1 means that it may be placed into a proper evolutionary context and we therefore aim to utilise a comprehensive multiwavelength dataset to determine its physical properties and consequently its relation to other sgB[e] stars and the global population of massive evolved stars within Wd 1. Methods. Multi-epoch R- and I-band VLT/UVES and VLT/FORS 2 spectra are used to constrain the properties of the circumstellar gas, while an ISO-SWS spectrum covering 2. 45 − 45 μm is used to investigate the distribution, geometry and composition of the dust via a semi-analytic irradiated disk model. Radio emission enables a long term mass-loss history to be determined, while X-ray observations <b>reveal</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>nature</b> of high energy processes within the system. Results. Wd 1 - 9 exhibits the rich optical emission line spectrum that is characteristic of sgB[e] stars. Likewise its mid-IR spectrum resembles those of the LMC sgB[e] stars R 66 and 126, revealing the presence of equatorially concentrated silicate dust, with a mass of ~ 10 − 4 M⊙. Extreme historical and ongoing mass loss (≳ 10 − 4 M⊙yr− 1) is inferred from the radio observations. The X-ray properties of Wd 1 - 9 imply the presence of high temperature plasma within the system and are directly comparable to a number of confirmed short-period colliding wind binaries within Wd 1. Conclusions. The most complete explanation for the observational properties of Wd 1 - 9 {{is that it is a}} massive interacting binary currently undergoing, or recently exited from, rapid Roche-lobe overflow, supporting the hypothesis that binarity mediates the formation of (a subset of) sgB[e] stars. The mass loss rate of Wd 1 - 9 is consistent with such an assertion, while viable progenitor and descendent systems are present within Wd 1 and comparable sgB[e] binaries have been identified in the Galaxy. Moreover, the rarity of sgB[e] stars - only two examples are identified from a census of ~ 68 young massive Galactic clusters and associations containing ~ 600 post-Main Sequence stars - is explicable given the rapidity (~ 104 yr) expected for this phase of massive binary evolution.

An upper limit of the background quasar emission redshift at z= 2. 1 is set to prevent the Lyα forest lines from contaminating the sensitive spectral region for the 2175 -Å bump measurements. The FM 90 (Fitzpatrick & Massa 1990) parameterization is applied to model the Optical/UV extinction curve in the rest frame of Mg II absorbers of the 2175 -Å bump candidates. The simulation technique developed by Jiang et al. (2010 a, b) is used to derive the statistical significance of the candidate 2175 -Å bumps. A total of 12 absorbers are detected with 2175 -Å bumps at a 5 σ level of statistical significance, 10 are detected at a 4 σ level and 17 are detected at a 3 σ level.

In the rocket range, about 500 m south-west {{of the main}} base: of Syowa, there are three buildings, namely a propellant magazine (10. 4 × 6. Om), a radar-telemeter hut (14. 4 × 6 m) and an assembly shop (12 × 7. 6 m) connected with a turntable. A turntable (8 m in diameter) {{in the center of}} the launching platform is at the same level as the floor of the assembly shop. A rocket carriage can be moved on rails from the assembly shop onto the launching turntable. Rotation of the turntable and movement of the launcher are remote-controlled. An iron-grating box covered with a vinyl sheet is attached to the launcher for keeping the rocket warm. The box is air-conditioned. The rocket is assembled and tested in the assembly shop and transferred to the turntable. The whole launching system is capable of firing a rocket with a diameter up to 350 mm. A radar-telemeter system and the igniter and timer controlers are installed in the radar-telemeter hut. A radar-tracking system with a power of 10 kW is used to measure the azimuth angle, the elevation angle, and the direct range, as well as to record telemeter signals in two channels transmitted by PPM modulation. The receiving frequency of the telemeter system is 290 MHz and the data in 12 channels is recorded. The control system consists of an ignition controller, a timer controller, and a probe controller. These control systems were designed to be operated by a limited number of technicians. There are two types of single-stage sounding rockets, S- 160 JA and S- 210 JA. Their specifications are as follows: [table] Butadiene solid propellant is used from the viewpoint of low temperaturecharacteristics. There is another type of rocket which will be used in the future; S- 310 JA type (payload 40 kg, peak altitude 220 km). These rockets were developed by the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science, University of Tokyo. In order to fire the rockets at the moment when auroral activities begin to show a drastic increase at the onset of an auroral substorm, some considerations were needed in the procedure of the firings in the Antarctic severe natural environment. As a result of many considerations and trainings, the rocket could be fired within one minute after the receiving of the introduction in the rocket launching. The ground-based observations were consolidated at Syowa Station, assisting the direct measurements of physical quantities in auroras by means of the sounding rockets. The instruments to be used in the auroral observations are: all-sky camera (35 mm, every 10 s), auroral zenith photometer (4278 A), multicolour geomagnetic meridian scanning photometers (4278, 5577, 6300 A, H_β), high sensitive TV camera and VHP auroral radar. It was 10 th February 1970 when the first launching of the sounding rocket was carried out at Syowa. Since then, four S- 160 JA type and nineteen S- 210 JA type rockets were flown during the period of the research program in 1970 - 1973. Objects of measurements were electron and ion densities, electric and magnetic fields, infrared and ultra-violet emissions, energetic paticles, X-rays and radiowave in aurora.

40|$|The {{project is}} {{in the field of}} {{interaction}} of ultrashort laser pulses with metals. The rapid development of short-pulsed laser systems over the last years offered opportunities for high-precision material processing and structuring {{of a wide range of}} materials – metals, 1 - 3 semiconductors, 4 and organic solids. 5 Besides a variety of practical applications of ultrashort laser pulses they also reveal some new fundamental aspects of laser-beam interactions with matter. Laser ablation is a basic mechanism in a large number of applications for laser processing: cutting, drilling, surface cleaning, pulsed laser deposition of thin films, etc. Recent investigations showed that its theory and modeling are very complex. The process depends strongly on the material’s properties and the parameters of the laser source. Moreover, its theory requires the combination of several different areas of physics. This is why the fundamental physics underlying the laser ablation mechanism is still unclear. Additionally, the description is complicated in the case of ultrashort-pulse laser ablation because of the number of non-thermal processes involved. Many theoretical models have been developed recently, 6 - 8 based generally on the heat conduction equation, hydrodynamics and molecular dynamics, which try to bring to light the basic features of short-pulse laser ablation process. According to these studies, several mechanisms of the ablation process can be realized, depending on the material and laser parameters. Some authors describe the ablation as melting followed by vaporization. Others indicate that a critical pressure gradient, arising in the short time interval after the laser interaction, {{is in the}} origin of the ejection process. In this case, the energy is deposited faster than the time of acoustic wave formation in the system, and the relaxation of the pressure gradient created leads to a significant material removal. On the other hand, if the laser pulse duration is shorter than the time for thermal relaxation of the system, defined by the thermal diffusion, overheating of the system can take place. Then, the temperature in the material reaches the critical point and a fast transition to a gaseous-liquid phase (phase explosion) occurs. Experimentally, basic properties and dynamics of ultrashort laser ablation have not yet been established, and experiments that focus on the ablated species are still rare. A few studies recently published have limited themselves to establish the presence of different species in the ablated plasma plume, namely ions, neutral atoms and nanoparticles. 9 - 11 In the present context the formation of: i) nanoparticles with a diameter in the  1 - 10 nm range; ii) sub-keV to keV ions, during ultrashort laser ablation of solid targets, constitute aspects on great interest, due to their possible applications. In fact, the former (i) could open up new route to the production of nanoparticles resulting of special interest in the field of nanophysics and nanotechnology, while the latter (ii) is considered particularly promising for the current deficiency of sub-keV high-flux ion beams delivered by presently available commercial techniques. The main goals of the project are concentrated on: •	development of a reliable numerical method based on Molecular dynamics simulation technique describing interaction of the ultrashort (< 10 ps) laser radiation with metals; •	detailed investigation of the process of ultrashort laser ablation of metals, including mechanisms of ablation, processes involved in the target material – phase transitions, shock wave evolution, crater formation, structure and evolution of the ablated material; •	detailed experimental investigations of the characteristics of laser ablation driven by ultrashort laser pulses through the analysis of the ejected material, as well as on their variation as a function of the laser pulse characteristics (energy density, wavelength, e. g.). The result obtained in the frame of the project can be used in different areas of application of ultrashort lasers – precise micromachining, pulsed laser deposition of thin films, nanoparticles generation, etc., as well as they can <b>reveals</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>nature</b> of <b>the</b> processes involved.
