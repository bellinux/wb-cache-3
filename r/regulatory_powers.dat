5|$|GA is {{regulated}} by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), although <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> are being increasingly transferred to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The main focus is on standards of airworthiness and pilot licensing, and {{the objective is to}} promote high standards of safety. At the lighter end of the GA spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies, and gliding is in transition from a self-regulatory model to more formal governance by EASA. Airspace regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of CAT operations has reduced the area in which GA flights can be freely conducted. The growth in CAT is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the GA sector, and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system has no remit to consider the national significance of GA public transport operations, and generally does not favour the development of smaller aerodromes catering to the GA market. The planning process has become a mechanism for addressing local aerodrome-related environmental issues which, particularly regarding noise, are the main subjects of public criticism levelled at GA.|$|E

25|$|Reynaud, however, {{had always}} wanted the Finance ministry. He {{endorsed}} radically liberal economic policies in order to draw France's economy out of stagnation, centered on a massive program of deregulation, including {{the elimination of the}} forty-hour work week. The notion of deregulation was very popular among France's businessmen, and Reynaud believed that it was the best way for France to regain investors' confidence again and escape the stagnation its economy had fallen into. The collapse of Léon Blum's government in 1938 was a response to Blum's attempt to expand the <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> of the French government; there was therefore considerable support in the French government for an alternative approach like Reynaud's.|$|E
25|$|Following the Civil War, the Maryland {{legislature}} {{pulled the}} college out of bankruptcy, and in February 1866 assumed half {{ownership of the}} school. The college thus became in part a state institution. George Washington Custis Lee, son of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, was appointed president of the college by the Board of Trustees, but due to public outcry declined the position. By October 1867, the school reopened with 11 students. In the next six years, enrollment continued to grow, and the school's debt was finally paid off. Twenty years later, the school's reputation as a research institution began, as the federally funded Agricultural Experiment Station was established there. During the same period, a number of state laws granted the college <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> in several areas—including controlling farm disease, inspecting feed, establishing a state weather bureau and geological survey, and housing the board of forestry.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of organizational variety in regulatory governance must recognize that, {{contrary to the}} classical agency model, regulatory functions are commonly diffused {{among a number of}} public and sometimes private bodies. A regimes approach assists in understanding the ways in which diffuse <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> is exercised and in identifying central issues for analysis. In this article, six parameters for classifying organizations in regulatory regimes are addressed: ownership, legal form, funding, functions, powers, and governance level. An exploration of these parameters is suggestive of novel approaches to questions of independence and accountability. With wide diffusion of <b>regulatory</b> <b>power,</b> interdependence is as much a hallmark of the regulatory state as the application of any strong independence doctrine. Accountability may be better conceived as consisting both of formal judicial and political mechanisms and of informal day-to-day ways in which those exercising <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> have to account to others co-located within the space of a particular regulatory regime...|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, a report by the Australian Communications and Media Authority was {{compiled}} {{a few days after the}} incident. The report concluded that loopholes in broadcasting rules should be closed, and Internet content regulations tightened. It was found that Big Brother itself could not be penalised as the footage was never broadcast by Network Ten but was seen only via web streaming, and the Internet falls outside ACMA's authority. Websites running the footage would not be penalised under other regulations governing web broadcasts as they had removed the footage when requested. Rival network current affairs programs A Current Affair on the Nine Network, and the Seven Network's Today Tonight, both broadcast the footage in full. Neither show faced a reprimand from ACMA as they can argue the footage was used as part of a news story. Presenting the ACMA report, Communications Minister Helen Coonan said that legislation to broaden the authority's <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> to cover the Internet and mobile phone broadcasts, would be introduced into Parliament as soon as possible.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt {{presided over}} the {{establishment}} of several agencies and measures designed to provide relief for the unemployed and others in need. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), {{under the leadership of}} Harry Hopkins, was designed to distribute relief to state governments. The Public Works Administration (PWA), under the leadership of Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, was created to oversee the construction of large-scale public works such as dams, bridges, and schools. The most popular of all New Deal agencies– and Roosevelt's favorite– was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which hired 250,000 unemployed young men to work on rural local projects. Roosevelt also expanded a Hoover agency, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, making it a major source of financing for railroads and industry. Congress gave the Federal Trade Commission broad new <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> and provided mortgage relief to millions of farmers and homeowners. Roosevelt also made agricultural relief a high priority and set up the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA). The AAA tried to force higher prices for commodities by paying farmers to take land out of crops and to cut herds.|$|E

500|$|The {{objective}} of regulation is to [...] "promote {{high standards of}} safety {{in all aspects of}} aviation", and this is the main area of interaction between the CAA and the GA sector. Efforts focus on assuring appropriate standards of airworthiness, pilot qualification, the rules for the movement of aircraft, and equipment to be carried. The CAA was established as the primary regulatory body for all aviation in the UK in 1972. In 1991 it started working within the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) framework to implement agreed common standards, known as the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR), throughout the European Union (EU). In 2003 this was taken a step further when the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was established as the central EU regulator, taking over responsibility for legislating airworthiness and environmental regulation from the national authorities. The CAA acts as an agency of EASA on these issues, retaining its original <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> in areas not yet transferred to EASA. Proposed developments seek to establish EASA as the single authority throughout the EU, taking over from individual member states the power to regulate all aviation other than that specifically excluded from the scope of EASA.|$|E
500|$|Rewriting {{the state}} {{constitution}} became Marshall's central focus as governor, and after the General Assembly refused to call a constitutional convention he began to seek alternative means by which {{to have a new}} constitution adopted. He and Jacob Piatt Dunn, a close friend and civic leader, wrote a new constitution that increased the state's <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> considerably, set minimum wages, and gave constitutional protections to unions. [...] Many of these reforms were also in the Socialist Party platform under its leader, Terre Haute native Eugene V. Debs. Republicans believed Marshall's constitution was an attempt to win over Debs' supporters, who had a strong presence in Indiana. The constitution also allowed direct-democracy initiatives and referendums to be held. The Democratic controlled assembly agreed to the request and put the measure on the ballot. His opponents attacked the direct-democracy provisions, claiming they were a violation of the United States Constitution, which required states to operate republican forms of government. The 1910 mid-term elections gave the Democrats control of the Indiana Senate, increasing the constitution's chances of being adopted. Marshall presented it to the General Assembly in 1911 and recommended that they submit it to voters in the 1912 election.|$|E
