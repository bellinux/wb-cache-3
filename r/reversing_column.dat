40|$|Abstract — Face {{recognition}} {{refers to}} identify any individual in a digital image by just analyzing and comparing the patterns. We all must {{understand the importance of}} human face in conveying information about people’s identity as it {{is a part of the}} human body by which we can identify a person without touching his/her body. Face recognition is better than biometrics because of its non-contact process. The use of average half face is done because Average half face not only gives better accuracy but saves storage and computation time also [1]. Both 2 D and 3 D images can be recognized using average half face. The average half face can be easily constructed from the full frontal face image in two steps; first step includes to center the face with nose tip as center point and divide it into two halves and then in second step the two halves are averaged together <b>reversing</b> <b>column</b> of one half. Once the average half face creation is completed then the features in the image are detected through Viola Jones method through concatenation process. After the detection process we can use various recognition algorithms such as Elastic Bunch Graph Matching (EBGM), Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Principal component analysis (PCA) or some intelligent recognition algorithm for the face recognition...|$|E
