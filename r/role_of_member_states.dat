Women's rights groups recognized a need to legally protect the citizenship rights of women who married someone from outside their country or nationality. The League of Nations, the international organization later succeeded by the United Nations, was lobbied by women's rights groups during the early 20th century to address the lack of international laws recognizing married women's rights of national citizenship. The Conference for the Codification of International Law, held at The Hague in 1930, drew protests from international women's rights groups, yet the League declined to include legislation enforcing married women's nationality rights. The League took the position that it was not their role, but the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> to deal with equality between men and women.|$|E

40|$|As institutionalists have assumed, {{institutions}} {{are supposed to}} shape the behaviours of actors towards collective objectives and better prospects. For this purpose, the EU has established an institutionalised framework for developing security and defence integration. This institutionalised framework not only provides ‘rules of games’ for conducting common security and defence affairs, but is supposed to make member states become socialised and embedded in European integration. However, the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> cannot be ignored. In fact, the institutionalisation process from the EPC to the CSDP is affected by institutionalism and intergovernmentalism. In other words, although the CSDP has an institutionalised framework which offers rules and procedures for member states and EU institutions to implement a common security and defence policy, it also operates {{on the basis of}} intergovernmental co-operation. The different effect of institutionalism and intergovernmentalism can also be discovered through analysing the very distinct attitudes of Britain and Germany in this institutionalisation process. This thesis aims to investigate the institutional development and practice of the security and defence integration of the EU, and examine the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in the process. Britain and Germany are chosen as comparative cases because these two countries have presented quite different preferences and attitudes towards the developments of European integration. This thesis concludes that although the institutionalisation process can affect member states in structuring behaviours and national interests, their political will is nevertheless the most important key to determining whether an institutionalised CSDP can fulfil the collective end of security and defence integration in the EU. ...|$|E

The evolution of the political system in Brussels and developments within the individual member states promise new insights into the European integration process.

Who participates at which stage of the European Union's policy cycle and how do national institutions and non-state actors interact and fit into the Union's system? The contributors show how member states have adapted their institutional structures in different ways to European integration, especially since the Maastricht Treaty. The editors' introduction argues that the extent and intensity of institutional interaction between the EU and its member states have led to a 'system of institutional fusion'.

40|$|The European Union {{is facing}} a {{profound}} crisis and is confronted with multiple challenges. Over the last two decades, it has experienced a series of dramatic changes to its powers, its institutional design, its constitutional framework and its borders. At the same time, the uneasy relationship between European citizens and elites has complicated both the reform and {{the function of the}} Union. While the Lisbon treaty provided some answers to crucial questions, it did not clarify the nature of the EU, which remains at the crossroads of federal and intergovernmental logic. The current economic and financial crisis puts the EU’s legitimacy further under pressure and creates the impression of a turning point. This book provides a concise analysis of the EU and its dynamics by paying particular attention to its day to day operation. It aims to help students and scholars understand its evolution, its institutions, its decision-making and the interactions between the EU and various actors. Avoiding abstract theorizing, the authors propose an easy to read analysis of how the Union works while recognizing the complexity of the situation.

40|$|MODIFICATIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IN RELATION TO THE ACCESSION OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC TO THE EUROPEAN UNION ABSTRACT The {{accession}} of the Czech Republic to the European Union {{was certainly}} {{one of the most important}} moments in the development of Czech legal order. The impact of this step may be seen in every branch of law - including constitutional law. The large number of publications on this issue indicates that the changes of constitutional law are an important issue in the Czech academic society. Yet, the literature is mostly fragmentary and mainly oriented at only some of the problems. This thesis tries to gather all the important changes in the branch of constitutional law, which occurred in relation to the Czech Republic's accession to EU. As the constitutional law is a very broad topic, the focus is laid on its institutional part and on the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (and its institutions) within the EU. This thesis consists of an introduction, four chapters (which are further divided with respect to the single topics), and a final conclusion. In introduction, the focus of the thesis and basic questions are defined. Chapter One briefly follows the process of the Czech Republic's accession to the EU. Chapter Two deals with the position of Member States within the EU. It touches on issues such as the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Current {{international}} relations theory struggles to explain both the autonomy and transformation of international organizations (IOs). Previous theories either fail {{to account for}} any IO behavior that deviates from the interests of member states, or neglect the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in reforming IO institutions and behavior. We propose an agency theory of IOs that can fill these gaps while also addressing two persistent problems {{in the study of}} IOs: common agency and long delegation chains. Our model explains slippage between member states interests and IO behavior, but also suggests institutional mechanisms staff selection, monitoring, procedural checks, and contracts through which states can rein in errant IOs. We evaluate this argument by examining multiple institutional reforms and lending patterns at the World Bank from 1980 to 2000.

40|$|The article {{begins with}} the steps of European {{integration}} and subsequently examines the various theories concerning {{the nature of the}} European Union and the problem of democratic deficit. In particular it underlines that to resolve the democratic deficit it is necessary not only to increase the European Parliament’s powers but also to implement the powers of the national Parliaments towards their respective Governments and to strengthen relations and forms of consultation and between the European Parliament and national Parliaments and cooperation between the latter. It also describes the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> national Parliaments in scrutinising the Government (national scrutiny system) and the forms of cooperation between national Parliaments. Finally it comments upon the articles of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and on the two Protocols (the Protocol on the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>Members</b> <b>States</b> and the Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality) involving national Parliaments at European level. The attention is particularly focused on the innovations to the discipline presently in force and on the improvements in the direction of more democracy and participation.

One big chapter of this reform dealt with senior personnel policy. New procedures were implemented, merit was upgraded as the main criteria for senior appointments, and compulsory redeployment was introduced. Against this background, the research was conducted in order to assess {{the extent to which these}} new measures have changed the way senior appointments take place inside the Commission, particularly in terms of influence coming from national governments. By assessing several hundred appointments and redeployments of director generals, deputy director generals and directors - and through interviews with 37 top Commission officials - the thesis revealed what substantive and systemic changes have progressively taken place since the early years of the Prodi Commission, as compared to the pre-reform situation (i. e. Santer Commission). Principal-agent theory was used to frame the research and derive the main hypotheses on the possible development in the relation between EU member states and the Commission. Among the main overall findings of the research, the empirical assessment revealed that 1) the role played by nationality in senior Commission appointments has undoubtedly decreased with the implementation of the reform; 2) the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in senior appointments has changed little from Santer to Prodi, due to the complementary finding that this role was already rather limited prior to the reform (a finding which runs against the mainstream literature on this issue); 3) mobility was a senior management tool that certainly helped the Commission to bring forward change to the administrative culture, but did not come to represent a tool used to resist member states’ pressures; and 4) unfit candidates have no longer a chance to be promoted to the upper echelons of the Commission administration...|$|E
40|$|Article 8 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) {{sets out}} a duty for the Union {{to develop a}} special {{relationship}} with neighbouring countries based inter alia on the good neighbourliness principle, on {{the values of the}} Union and characterised by close and peaceful cooperation. This is proposed to be achieved through the conclusion of ‘specific agreements with the countries concerned’, possibly based on reciprocity of rights and obligations and/or joined activities. As evidenced by the various contributions in the present volume, many questions spring to mind when reading this new provision, regarding its raison d’être, its scope and its implications {{within the framework of the}} EU Treaties and the wider good neighbourliness principle deriving from international law. The <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> vis-à-vis the Union’s neighbours has been outlined in this volume in various contexts, and the Member States’ own commitment towards good neighbourliness within the EU. As rightly pointed out by another contributor to this volume in the context of the EU enlargement policy, ‘[d]epending upon the involvement of EU Member States and the risks for the importation of regional disputes into the EU’s internal structures, the requirement of good neighbourliness is either translated into an obligation of conduct or an obligation of result’, thereby revealing the changing or flexible nature of good neighbourliness. To determine the scope of good neighbourliness in the EU legal order, as enshrined in particular in Article 8 TEU, and delimit any underlying commitment on the part of Member States, there is arguably a need to examine the ‘micro’ or individual relations a Member State maintains with its own neighbours. Such a micro-analysis of essentially bilateral relations should also permit reflections on the question of reciprocity and ‘sharing of values’ underlying good neighbourliness in a given relationship or set of relations. In this context, Cyprus is believed to be a unique case study, arguably standing both geographically and substantively at the ‘edge’ of good neighbourliness and as such, outlining the flexible nature of good neighbourliness through its atypical or ‘outer’ application in EU law. The micro-analysis in the case of Cyprus would focus on the ‘de facto neighbouring’ relations the Republic of Cyprus maintains with the part of its own sovereign territory under Turkish military control (internal relations) and, as a result, on the rather uneasy relations Cyprus maintains with Turkey as its neighbour, at the Union’s door-step and also as a candidate country currently undergoing the accession negotiation process (external relations). This chapter therefore proposes to deepen our understanding of the good neighbourliness principle in EU law, as enshrined in Article 8 TEU and within the overall fabric of the EU Treaties, from the perspective of the Member States – more specifically of a single one, Cyprus – in an attempt to identify some of the outer limits of good neighbourliness. This will be done through a review of the scope of Article 8 TEU, including from the perspective of a single Member State (2), followed by an analysis of the outward application of good neighbourliness in the context of Cyprus ‘from within’ the EU (3) and finally ‘from outside’ the EU, also from the lens of reciprocity and shared values arguably lying at the core of good neighbourliness (4). The lessons to be learnt from Cyprus will relate to the scope of good neighbourliness in the EU legal order and to the specific forms it may take when considering the troubled relations of a single Member State with its ‘neighbours’. Good neighbourliness may be more ‘demanding’ on a specific Member State in a situation internal to the EU, but there may be counterparts in this case. This chapter will also assess the extent to which uneasy bilateral relations between a Member State and a third country can be efficiently addressed through EU external relations, the form this good neighbourliness will take and the legal and political implications it may have on other EU Member States, the third country concerned and the values of the Union...|$|E

It recognises that the Community emerged from the self-help based international system and emphasises the continuing central <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> However, conceiving <b>of</b> the Community as one international institution among many others it tends to disregard the specificities of this particular institution.

'Sustainable peace' means resolving both the structural causes and violent symptoms of conflict in ways that guarantee, rather than enforce peace. As explored throughout the chapter, the normative principle of sustainable peace should be considered the ‘prime norm' in the EU, although the EU has historically been far more focused on structural issues of human security than peacekeeping...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify sources of the challenges faced by the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of the European Union. Based on an actorness approach, the paper offers a systematic and theory-driven framework for the analysis of these challenges.

The paper identifies two main sources at a national level. First, it shows that the significance of national sovereignty in the sensitive domain of security and defence policy is an obstacle to the development of the CSDP. Second, the analysis reveals that foreign policy role conceptions are a fundamental factor: different <b>role</b> conceptions <b>of</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> result in a lack of mutual understanding, in missing trust, and finally, in the unwillingness to transfer actorness to the EU level despite a common set of basic interests and values.

This book provides a comprehensive and theoretically-informed analysis of how Cohesion policy has evolved over time and, in particular the budgetary and policy dynamics of the 2007 - 13 reform. In the context of the budgetary politics of the EU, the book examines the process by which the reform of Cohesion policy has been was shaped; it identifies the key factors that explain the allocation of funding, assesses the <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> European Commission and European Parliament, and tests whether the process and outcome are consistent with the expectations of EU decision-making and integration theories. Based on extensive, EU-wide research over a ten-year period, the book provides new insights into both the process and outcomes of EU policy reform. Presenting original research in an accessible format, this book will be of interest to scholars as well as undergraduate and postgraduate students in the fields of European integration and policy studies...|$|R

The crucial <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> herein has been recognised in that both ESDP’s weaknesses and strengths are usually explained by their considerable influence. This thesis identifies, analyses, and compares the influence of France, Britain and Germany on the development and design of ESDP. To what extent have the three countries been able to shape ESDP according to their preferences? How did they proceed? These questions are addressed through a comparative analysis of the national agendas, the effective influence, and the mechanisms of influencing in three case studies representing key steps in ESDP development: the first institutions (1999 / 2000); the European Security Strategy (2003); and the Battlegroup concept (2003 / 2004). The analysis applies the concept of Europeanisation supported by policy analysis in order to grasp both, the uploading capacity of the countries as a process and the content wise result in form of ESDP. The analysis confirms that the three countries decisively directed ESDP’s development in institutional, strategic and material terms. The preferences, which they intentionally uploaded to the EU level, informed the final outcome in form of ESDP. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
