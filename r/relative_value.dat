5|$|A {{scoring system}} to {{evaluate}} material {{is to add}} up the piece values of the material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are {{a consequence of the}} difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose <b>relative</b> <b>value,</b> due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They {{are also more likely to}} be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E
5|$|Following the California {{gold rush}} {{that began in}} 1849 and the Australian gold rush that began in 1851, a larger amount of gold was put into {{commerce}} than could be easily absorbed by the normal channels. This resulted in {{a decrease in the}} value of gold and an increase in the <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> of silver. As a result, silver coins rapidly disappeared from circulation due either to hoarding or melting. In response, Congress authorized the Mint to reduce the quantity of silver in all denominations except the three-cent piece and silver dollar. Beginning in the 1860s, silver production rose and the price decreased. During this time, silver coins largely disappeared from circulation and were replaced by copper and paper currency.|$|E

5|$|Henry Chadwick is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} invention of scorekeeping in baseball. Chadwick was also {{the inventor of the}} modern box score and the writer of the first rule book for the game of baseball. Since baseball statistics were initially a subject of interest to sportswriters, the role of the official scorer in Major League Baseball (MLB) {{in the early days of}} the sport was performed by newspaper writers. A judgment call that is required by the official scorer does not alter the outcome of a game, but these judgments impact the statistical records of the game. As the subjective scoring decisions which are used to calculate baseball statistics began to be used to determine the <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> of baseball players, MLB began to require approval from the league before a writer-scorer could be assigned to produce the scoring report for a game. By the 1970s, writers who were willing to score games for MLB were required to have attended 100 or more games per year in the prior three years and to be chosen by the local chapter chairman of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Qualified candidates for scoring were submitted to the leagues for approval.|$|E
25|$|On January 1, 1992, Medicare {{introduced}} the Medicare Fee Schedule (MFS), {{a list of}} about 7,000 services that can be billed for. Each service is priced within the Resource-Based <b>Relative</b> <b>Value</b> Scale (RBRVS) with three <b>Relative</b> <b>Value</b> Units (RVUs) values largely determining the price. The three RVUs for a procedure are each geographically weighted and the weighted RVU value is multiplied by a global Conversion Factor (CF), yielding a price in dollars.

25|$|The {{weighting}} system converts the physical units of different energy carriers into a uniform metric (site/final energy, source/primary energy renewable parts included or not, energy cost, equivalent carbon emissions and even energy or environmental credits) and allows their comparison and compensation among {{each other in}} one single balance (e.g. exported PV electricity can compensate imported biomass).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{individual}} differences in relative grip-strengthendurance (RGE) variables and relations between force, endurance time and level of subjective musclefatigue sensation (SMS) of RGE. Endurance time and SMS during grip-strength exertion using various <b>relative</b> demand <b>values</b> to the maximal grip-strength-value (MAX) were analyzed. Subjects were 23 healthy adults (male 10 and female 13). Four demand values of 25, 35, 50 and 75 % were selected as <b>relative</b> demand <b>values</b> to MAX. The grip-strength-exertion value was input into a personal computer using the system of grip-strength with a strain-gauge (Yagami : ED-D 100 R). The results are summarized as follows: 1) Muscle group related to grip-strength exertion recovered up to about 60 % of initial within 10 - 15 sec after grip-strength exertion stopped regardless of the degree of <b>relative</b> demand <b>values.</b> 2) The SMS in any <b>relative</b> demand <b>values</b> reached a peak after continuing <b>relative</b> demand <b>values</b> became impossible, and the tendency is stronger with a higher demand value. 3) With about 25 % <b>relative</b> demand <b>values,</b> physiological muscle fatigue and SMS advanced at almost the same time, and the grip-strength exertion was possible for a little while after the SMS reached a peak. 4) With the lower <b>relative</b> demand <b>values</b> under 50 %, the influence of SMS appeared stronger by extending the endurance time and the decline-delay of grip-strength-exertion. 5) With <b>relative</b> demand <b>values</b> over 50 %, continuing <b>relative</b> demand <b>values</b> became impossible within a short time, and the peak SMS appeared earlier than that of <b>relative</b> demand <b>values.</b> On the other hand, the continuing the lower <b>relative</b> demand <b>values</b> was possible to some extent, and individual differences in the continuance and peak arrival-times of SMS were large...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the dispatching {{problem in a}} size- and state-aware multi-queue system with Poisson arrivals and queue-specific job sizes. By size- and state-awareness, we mean that the dispatcher knows {{the size of an}} arriving job and the remaining service times of the jobs in each queue. By queue-specific job sizes, we mean that the time to process a job may depend on the chosen server. We focus on minimizing the mean sojourn time (i. e., response time) by an MDP approach. First we derive the so-called size-aware <b>relative</b> <b>values</b> of states with respect to the sojourn time in an M/G/ 1 queue operating under FIFO, LIFO, SPT or SRPT disciplines.
