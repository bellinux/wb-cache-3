The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> scene...

Wollheim made an offer for Jordan's first novel, Warriors of the Ataii, though he withdrew the offer when Jordan {{requested}} some {{minor changes to the}} contract. Jordan claims that Wollheim's first, 'laudatory' letter convinced him that he could write, and so he chose to <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> letter and forget about the second. The novel was never published, but Jordan went on to write the immensely successful Wheel of Time series for a different publisher.|$|E

500|$|The {{musical score}} for Girl with a Pearl Earring {{was written by}} the French {{composer}} Alexandre Desplat.

And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him." ...|$|E

He advocated moving American troops from southern and central Iraq to the north, and further commented that political reconciliation must be refocused on [...] "building local governance" [...] rather than spending [...] "all the time on the national government." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, he made a distinction between [...] "experience and judgment" [...] and emphasized the importance of the latter. Vilsack attacked Republican candidate John McCain's planned Iraq troop surge as [...] "making a big mistake bigger", and denied that the military had the resources to execute it.

The album, released under the title Tales of Silversleeve and produced by Liam Howe of Sneaker Pimps, was preceded by [...] "Reuben", its first single, on 21 September 2007. Davey explained the title choice, [...] "I had a runny nose when I was a child and let's just say I didn't wipe it with a tissue". This proved to be a successful move as it led to a Choice Music Prize nomination for 2007 Irish Album of the Year. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said it was [...] "even more imaginative" [...] than her debut and gave it four out of five stars. entertainment.ie reviewer Lauren Murphy described the record as [...] "Without doubt, one of the best albums of the year", noting [...] "there's a magic about Tales of Silversleeve that makes it an album you're almost afraid to listen to twice, in case it's not as good as you <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time".

500|$|Several reviewers {{considered}} Middlesex to {{be overly}} verbose. The Economist described the novel as [...] "ponderous" [...] {{and said that the}} main story (that of Cal) does not [...] "get off the ground until halfway through" [...] the book. Times Richard Lacayo concurred; he considered the hundreds of pages about Cal's grandparents and several historical events to be trite, making Middlesexs focus [...] "footloose" [...] in some spots. Several passages in the novel exhibit Eugenides' obsession with [...] "verbose voluptuousness". An example noted by Thea Hillman in her review is an incident in which Cal says, [...] "I sat in my seat, in a state of voluptuous agitation, of agitated voluptuousness, until my stop. Then I staggered out." [...] A contrary opinion is given by Daniel Soar in his article for the London Review of Books. According to Soar, Eugenides did [...] "both background and foreground in all the necessary detail", seamlessly shifting from past to present. Despite the implausible tone of the novel's events, the author successfully makes them [...] "elaborately justified and motivated". The quality of Middlesexs writing was uneven in the opinions of Hillman and another reviewer, Sebastian Smee. The latter pointed out that Eugenides occasionally moves from the heartfelt ("I <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time we took off our clothes in front of each other. It was like unwinding bandages") to the [...] "trashily journalistic" [...] ("You've heard of installation artists? Well, the Object [...] was an exhalation artist") on several occasions.|$|E
