2500|$|The Caudron-Fabre had an {{undercarriage}} {{composed of}} both wheels and floats, {{though it was}} possible to remove the former; photographs show the aircraft in both configurations. [...] There was no cross-axle, each wheel being mounted individually on two pairs of outwardly splayed V-struts from the feet of the inner interplane struts and another to the feet of the nearest centre-section struts. Its floats were mounted immediately ahead of the wheels, articulated at a forward point on their centreline by a strut from the outrigger, a strut from the wing leading edge over the wheels and another from the wheel axle. A <b>rear</b> <b>strut</b> had a pneumatic shock absorber. [...] A third float, similar in size and shape, was mounted on a vertical strut attached to the girder cross-member ahead of the tailplane, braced at its lower end by a pair of struts angled up {{to the ends of the}} vertical girders. [...] The floats were flat bottomed with segmental section and an almost square plan, with a width about 70% of their length. As on Fabre's original aircraft, they were mounted with a pronounced angle of attack.|$|E

50|$|On the {{front-wheel drive}} Betas, Lancia {{designed}} a particularly original {{independent rear suspension}} with MacPherson struts attached to parallel transverse links that pivoted on a centrally mounted cross member bolted to {{the underside of the}} floorpan. An anti-roll bar was fitted to the floorpan ahead of the <b>rear</b> <b>struts</b> with both ends of the bar trailing back to bolt to the <b>rear</b> <b>struts</b> on each side. This unique design went on to be used in later Lancia models. The design was never patented by Lancia, and consequently inspired similar rear suspension system layouts in other manufacturers' vehicles during the 1980s and 1990s.|$|R

5000|$|The {{design was}} largely {{conventional}} overall, {{except for the}} interplane struts. These were arranged in two sets, front and rear, with the rear sets consisting of two struts per wing, and the forward sets of only one strut per wing. When viewed {{from the front of}} the aircraft, rather than standing vertically, the <b>rear</b> <b>struts</b> formed a V-shape, converging to the point where they met the lower wings. From bottom wing to top, the single forward struts sloped inwards towards the centreline, matching the angle of the inboard <b>rear</b> <b>struts.</b> The fin was triangular and similar to the unit on earlier Lloyd designs, but featured an extension at the top of the rudder that reached over the top of the fixed part of the fin. With its curved leading edge and scalloped trailing edge, this rudder resembled the tail of a rooster, and gained the aircraft the nickname Kikeriki (German: [...] "Cock-a-doodle-doo").|$|R

50|$|This is {{the first}} showing of Mazda's SS (self-stabilizing) rear suspension. The two lower {{parallel}} links of the <b>rear</b> <b>strut</b> are designed to induce toe-in on the rear tire on the outer side of the curve (e.g. right turn - left rear tire).|$|E
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the models}} US run a {{widebody}} could be bought with a [...] "Sports Handling Package" [...] or SHP. This included adjustable front and <b>rear</b> <b>struts</b> and 1 inch wider wheels (up from 16 x 7 to 8" [...] front and 16 x 8 to 9" [...] rear). The SHP was only offered during the '88 and '89 model years. The package can be retro fitted to earlier pre-widebody cars.|$|R
50|$|The Duiker had an all-wood structure. The wing was {{slightly}} swept back, which {{gave rise to}} instability at all speeds, and even caused {{the separation of the}} wing from the <b>rear</b> <b>struts.</b> The fin was rather small and was typical of Sopwith design in shape. An Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar engine was initially used, but this was later changed to a Bristol Jupiter IV. The first flight took place in July 1923. Only one aircraft was built.|$|R

50|$|The Challenger's wing {{was built}} in two parts, both {{rectangular}} in plan out to semi-elliptical tips, which met {{on top of the}} fuselage and were mounted with 1.5° dihedral. They had wooden structures built around two box spars and were fabric covered. Parallel struts from beyond mid-span braced the spars to the lower fuselage longerons and the <b>rear</b> <b>struts</b> were also braced near their midpoints to the upper longerons; all struts were enclosed in wide, airfoil section fairings. Its inset ailerons were long and narrow.|$|R

After a crash, which kept Cody {{in bed for}} a few days in June, the Green powerplant was replaced by a [...] E.N.V. Type F engine. A fixed horizontal surface was added to the rudder and the ailerons were moved inwards and back, so that they were between the <b>rear</b> <b>struts</b> and the outer bay of each wing.|$|R
50|$|The Proton Satria R3 is {{a limited}} edition Satria sold in Malaysia. It was officially soft-launched on 4 October 2004, then made {{available}} for booking on 17 October 2004. The term R3 stands for Race, Rally, Research. R3 is a redefined version of Satria Gti by Proton's Racing development team and also Lotus. It houses the same 1800 cc Mitsubishi 4G93p engine but has undergone some minor adjustments by Lotus handling. The body shell has been improved with double stitch welded monocoque chassis with front and <b>rear</b> <b>strut</b> tower brace bars. Body weight has been lighten as well. It comes with Recaro SR4 semi-bucket seats, both Momo steering wheel and gear knob.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} has two wings {{which can}} be dismounted for transport. The leading edge box consists of a spar and fibreglass leading edge, supplemented by an alloy <b>rear</b> <b>strut.</b> The wing profile is defined by preformed aluminum ribs. The trailing edge spar is laminated fiberglass. These three elements are interconnected by compression rods, cables and ribs, and ensure the shape and tension of the fabric coating for good aerodynamic efficiency. The coating is [...] "Bainbridge" [...] Dacron, 170 gr/m². Once in place on the fuselage, cables and a kingpost stay the two wings. [...] The fuselage and vertical fin are made of a fiberglass-polyester structure consisting of 2 half shells molded and stiffened by frames and smoothed to have a lightweight structure with an aerodynamic shape. Once completed they are assembled by gluing, which ensures rigidity.|$|E
50|$|The 240SX was {{released}} {{in the spring of}} 1994 as a 1995 model. The hatchback and convertible body styles were eliminated, leaving only the coupe. The wheelbasecar grew 2 in and the track width was also increased, while the overall length of the vehicle was slightly shorter than the previous generation. The curb weight of the vehicle increased by about 80 lbs kg relative to the 1994 model. Dual air bags were added and the automatic seatbelts were replaced with common manual type. The pop-up headlights were removed in favor of fixed lamps. Though the general layout remained the same, almost all parts were redesigned to the extent that very few parts are interchangeable. The chassis was changed slightly to increase stiffness (Nissan claimed 50% torsional, 100% bending rigidity increase) and utilized higher <b>rear</b> <b>strut</b> mounts. The fuel tank, previously located at the rear end under the trunk floor, now sat in front of the rear suspension and behind the rear seats.|$|E
5000|$|Technical {{modifications}} include re-designed {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>struts</b> coupled to new steering gear, {{as well as}} adjusted dampers and new rear hydraulic axle bearings.

50|$|Several Civil Aviation Department {{aircraft}} {{were named}} after lunar related periods; Kartik (Sanskrit: कार्तिकः) is the eighth {{month of the}} Indian national calendar. The glider named after {{it was one of}} at least five designed by S. Ramamrithram at the Civil Aviation Department. It was a single seat, high performance machine, fairly conventional apart from the wing planform of the first variant, the KS-I Kartik. Rather than the usual taper, its 15 m span, high, cantilever wing had inner and outer rectangular panels of different chord, 200 mm narrower outboard. This approximated taper and was simpler to build with fewer different sized ribs. The mid-wing joins were blended with short tapered sections of the trailing edge; the leading edges were straight. Overall there was 1° of forward sweep. The wing structure was wooden, consisting of a single main spar with plywood skinning forward from it around the leading edge to form a torsion resisting box, a secondary <b>rear</b> <b>strut</b> and diagonal drag struts at the wing roots. Fabric covering was used aft of the main spar. The wing was mounted with 1.50° of dihedral. It was fitted with ply covered, wood framed ailerons and had wooden air brakes which opened above and below at mid-chord.|$|E
