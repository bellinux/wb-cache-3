500|$|Biscayne Bay is {{a shallow}} lagoon with little {{vertical}} density or salinity gradient {{due to its}} lack of depth. Instead of a vertical gradient, the bay shows a horizontal density gradient, with fresh water entering from the drainage canals {{on the west side}} and seawater entering through gaps in the keys and through the safety valve section of shoals. Bay salinity reaches a peak in June. Changes in the salinity pattern of the bay have had negative effects on formerly abundant species such as red drum. Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay are major nurseries for <b>red</b> <b>grouper</b> and gray snapper. The bottom of the lagoon hosts sponges and soft corals in places where grasses cannot not grow. Three primary species of seagrass are found in the park: turtlegrass, shoal grass and manatee grass. The endangered Johnson's seagrass is also found in small quantities in the bay, which is {{at the southern end of}} the grass's range. Roughly 75 percent of the central bay floor is covered by grasses. Scarring of seagrass beds by vessel groundings or propellers is a significant problem. About 200 such incidents are documented each year, with full re-growth requiring up to 15 years. The bay is also affected by commercial shrimp trawling, which is permitted in park waters. [...] The passage of roller-frame trawl nets does not harm grasses, but damages soft corals and sponges.|$|E

40|$|Red {{groupers}} (Epinephelus akaara Temminck & Schlegel) {{and black}} sea breams (Mylio macrocephalus Basilewsky) were transferred from 30 ‰ into 3, 7, 12, 20, and 30 ‰ salinity. Fish were sampled at 0, 6, 24, 96, 168 and 336 h after transfer. Serum osmolality, glucose, protein, Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, liver glycogen, liver protein, muscle water and haematocrit were determined. In general, transient disturbances in these variables were observed after transfer. For both species, no tissue hydration was observed upon acclimation to different salinities, whereas a progressive increase in haematocrit value was found as salinity decreased. Liver glycogen of both species, however, was higher in hypo-osmotic salinities. Serum Na+ of the <b>red</b> <b>groupers</b> declined upon acclimation to 7 ‰ salinity but the opposite {{was found for}} the black sea breams.

50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus morio) is {{a species}} of fish in the Family Serranidae. The red grouper's typical range is coastal areas in the western Atlantic, {{stretching}} from southern Brazil to North Carolina in the US and including the Gulf of Mexico. This demersal, largely sedentary species has an extended (~40 day) pelagic larval stage before it settles in shallow coastal hardbottom habitat as juveniles. They remain in inshore waters for 4-5 years before migrating to offshore hardbottom habitat—particularly {{on the edge of}} the continental self—as adults. Spawning occurs offshore between January and June, peaking in May. While primarily eating benthic invertebrates, the <b>red</b> <b>grouper</b> is an opportunistic feeder in the reef community. The diet commonly includes xanthid and portunid crabs, juvenile spiny lobster, and snapping shrimp, with the occasional fish. The <b>red</b> <b>grouper</b> is of moderate size, about 125 cm and weighs 23 kg or more. Body coloration is typically reddish-brown in color often, with many white spots. When aggravated (they are highly territorial) or involved in spawning activities, these fish can very rapidly change coloration patterns, with the head or other parts of the body turning completely white, and the white spots appearing more intense.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The grouper is {{a popular}} marine food fish of high market value in Southeast Asia. Groupers have been farmed in netcages in coastal water for a longtime. The species which have been reared in {{tropical}} countries are estuarine grouper, Epinephelus malabaricus, black spotted grouper, E. salmoides and brown spotted grouper, E. tauvina. Some countries, like Indonesia and Singapore have attempted to rear leopard grouper, Plectropomus leopardus. In southern part of China and Japan the <b>red</b> spotted <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus akaara, have been cultured in floating netcage. Induced breeding trials for E. tauvina have been conducted since 1977 in Singapore. The induced spawning by hormone injection have been reported successful in Singapore, Kuwait and Thailand. However, the nursing of fry up to fingerlings are still under experiment. Therefore, uncertain supply of fingerlings from the wild has been the main problem for fish culture through out the region...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{show how}} the <b>red</b> spotted <b>grouper</b> nervous {{necrosis}} virus (RGNNV) causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and promotes host secondary apoptotic necrosis. RGNNV viral proteins such as protein α (42 kDa) and protein A (110 kDa) were quickly expressed between 12 h and 24 h postinfection (p. i.) in GL-av cells. Annexin V staining revealed that the NNV infection of GL-av cells induced phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization and development of bulb-like vesicles (bleb formation) at 24 h p. i. NNV infection also induced DNA fragmentation detectable by TUNEL assay between 12 h (8 %) and 72 h (32 %) p. i. Bongkrekic acid (1. 6 μM; BKA) blocked permeability of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, but cyclosporine A (CsA) did not block secondary necrosis. Finally, secondary necrotic cells were not engulfed by neighboring cells. Our data suggest that RGNNV induces apoptotic death via opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore thereby triggering secondary necrosis in the mid-apoptotic phase...|$|R

Vertebral and dorsal proximal radials were recognized as the most susceptible parts to deformation. The main types of bone deformity were lordosis, scoliosis, fusion, shortening, branching, supernumerary elements, and saddleback syndrome. Development of saddleback syndrome was detected initially in preflexion stage, which was accompanied by deformity of the neural spines, dorsal proximal radials, and disposition of the distal radials and dorsal spines in later life stages.
