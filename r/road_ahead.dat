5|$|The <b>Road</b> <b>Ahead,</b> {{written with}} Microsoft {{executive}} Nathan Myhrvold and journalist Peter Rinearson, {{was published in}} November 1995. It summarized {{the implications of the}} personal computing revolution and described a future profoundly changed by the arrival of a global information superhighway.|$|E
5|$|Just east of {{the railway}} bridge, the road crosses the {{boundary}} between the London boroughs of Southwark and Lewisham, where the <b>road</b> <b>ahead</b> becomes New Cross Road. The road appears on a map to form a boundary between Walworth, and Peckham to the south and Bermondsey to the north although the Bermondsey boundary runs along Rolls Road.|$|E
5|$|The road {{starts as}} a {{continuation}} of the A501, a major road through Central London, at its junction with Marylebone Road and Great Portland Street. It meets the northern end of Tottenham Court Road at a large junction where there is an underpass, and ends at King's Cross with Gray's Inn Road. The <b>road</b> <b>ahead</b> to Islington is Pentonville Road.|$|E

5|$|The {{street is}} the main link between the two cities of Westminster and London. It runs eastward from Trafalgar Square, {{parallel}} to the River Thames, to Temple Bar which is {{the boundary between the}} two cities at this point; the <b>road</b> <b>ahead</b> being Fleet Street. Traffic travelling eastbound follows a short crescent around Aldwych, connected at both ends to the Strand. The road marks the southern boundary of the Covent Garden district and forms part of the Northbank business improvement district.|$|E
5|$|The street runs {{east from}} Temple Bar, the {{boundary}} between the Cities of London and Westminster, as a continuation of the Strand from Trafalgar Square. It crosses Chancery Lane and Fetter Lane to reach Ludgate Circus by the London Wall. The <b>road</b> <b>ahead</b> is Ludgate Hill. The street numbering runs consecutively from west to east south-side and then east to west north-side. It links the Roman and medieval boundaries of the City after the latter was extended. The section of Fleet Street between Temple Bar and Fetter Lane is part of the A4, a major road running west through London, although it once ran along the entire street and eastwards past St Paul's Churchyard towards Cannon Street.|$|E
5|$|Rane, {{in command}} of {{a section of the}} 37th Assault Field Company, {{attached}} to the 4th Dogra Battalion, was sent forward to help clear a path for the battalion. As Rane and his team started clearing a minefield, mortar fire from the Pakistanis killed two sappers and wounded five others, including Rane. Despite this, by the evening of 8 April, Rane and his surviving men cleared the minefield which enabled the supporting tanks to move forward. A safe lane still had to be prepared for the tanks as the <b>road</b> <b>ahead</b> was still dangerous; the Pakistani forces had yet to be cleared from the area. This lane was created by Rane through the night. The next day, his section worked for twelve continuous hours to clear mines and roadblocks. As the road was still too difficult to deal with, he made a diversion for the battalion to forward. Rane continued this work despite ongoing artillery and mortar fire from the Pakistanis.|$|E

25|$|Unpolarized light, after {{reflection}} at a specular (shiny) surface, generally obtains {{a degree}} of polarization. This phenomenon was observed in 1808 by the mathematician Étienne-Louis Malus after whom Malus's law is named. Polarizing sunglasses exploit this effect to reduce glare from reflections by horizontal surfaces, notably the <b>road</b> <b>ahead</b> viewed at a grazing angle.|$|E
25|$|A {{headlamp}} is a lamp {{attached to}} the front of a vehicle to light the <b>road</b> <b>ahead.</b> While it is common for the term headlight to be used interchangeably in informal discussion, headlamp is the term for the device itself, while headlight properly refers to the beam of light produced and distributed by the device.|$|E
25|$|Night {{driving is}} {{difficult}} and dangerous due to the blinding glare of headlights from oncoming traffic. Headlamps that satisfactorily illuminate the <b>road</b> <b>ahead</b> without causing glare have long been sought. The first solutions involved resistance-type dimming circuits, which decreased {{the intensity of the}} headlamps. This yielded to tilting reflectors, and later to dual-filament bulbs with a high and a low beam.|$|E

Just five minutes earlier a platelayer had walked past the spot and seen nothing amiss. The engine, a Midland compound No. 1010, ploughed into the mass of clay at a speed of 60 mph, telescoping the front two carriages and killing seven passengers.|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{interior}} uncluttered, a number of convenience functions were integrated into multifunction controls. For example, the power windows and mirrors were controlled by a single instrument. Also, the center-mounted instrument cluster was canted slightly toward the driver. The displacement of these gauges {{to the middle of the}} dash was intended to offer an unimpeded view of the hood and the <b>road</b> <b>ahead.</b>|$|E
25|$|In October 2017, General Motors {{acquired}} Strobe, a {{solid state}} LIDAR company. Strobe’s prototypes produce brief “chirps” of frequency-modulated (FM) laser light, where the frequency within each chirp varies linearly. Measuring the phase {{and frequency of}} the echoing chirp allows the system to directly measure both the distance and the velocity of objects in the <b>road</b> <b>ahead.</b> Strobe, Cruise and GM will work together to develop the technology for future self-driving cars.|$|E
25|$|In 1940 the War Department {{authorized}} {{the establishment of}} Air Corps enlisted replacement centers for the initial training of recruits. The Air Corps established {{the first of these}} centers at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, in the summer of 1940, though formal activation did not occur until 21 February 1941. Since the <b>road</b> <b>ahead</b> for most AAF enlistees led toward some specialized technical training, the replacement centers were placed {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Air Corps Technical Training Command.|$|E

In {{broadcasting}} she has appeared as a critic, commentator and presenter on several BBC programmes and is a regular speaker and chair at festivals in the UK and internationally.

The Islanders was written with Mason's ex-partner, Art Brut singer Eddie Argos and award-winning [...] folk singer-songwriter, Jim Moray. It won the 2013 Ideas Tap Edinburgh Fringe Fund, before being published as a graphic novel by Nasty Little Press. Mason's non-fiction has {{also appeared in}} The Guardian. In 2009 Mason's short story 'To the Bridge' {{was published in the}} Tindal Street Press anthology <b>Roads</b> <b>Ahead.</b>|$|R
25|$|Diversion routes {{are marked}} with black symbols on a yellow patch (square, triangle, circle, or diamond). These mark diversionary routes {{in the event}} that the <b>road</b> <b>ahead</b> is closed for any reasons. Motorists can {{navigate}} following the symbol, and can find their way back to the original road at a junction above the closure. The four symbols may be filled (solid) or outlines. They are most commonly placed on directional signs, following the route number (e.g. A 25) but may be free standing.|$|E
25|$|Roughly {{one third}} of the {{population}} are highly susceptible to motion sickness and most of the rest may get motion sickness under extreme conditions. Several factors influence susceptibility to motion sickness. Statistics indicate that {{women are more likely to}} be affected than men and that the risk decreases with advancing age. There is some evidence that people with Asian ancestry get motion sickness more frequently compared with people of European ancestry, and there are situational and behavioral factors, such as whether a passenger has a view of the <b>road</b> <b>ahead,</b> and diet and eating behavior.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{this early}} promise, from 21 July onwards GM 16 slowed its march westward on the poorly {{constructed}} Route 7 toward Sala Phou Khoun, fearing land mines. On 22 July, GM 11 from Luang Prabang departed its intermediate objective at Phou Chia {{accompanied by an}} American combat controller and a U.S. Army adviser. The Neutralists from the southern column also had forward air control help. Relaying instructions through an airborne radio link and using large bamboo arrows as target designators, they had the RLAF's Lao and Thai pilots clearing the <b>road</b> <b>ahead</b> of them with bombs. Having reached Muong Kassy south of the 7/13 junction on 25 July, they waited five days for GM 17 to arrive.|$|E
