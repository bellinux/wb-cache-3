40|$|The law of {{probation}} revocation developed rapidly over the eighteen years preceding this article’s 1989 appearance. While its development has slowed substantially since then, {{it continues to}} evolve. The overall field of Nebraska probation revocation remains essentially unchanged from {{the way it was}} in 1989 when this article first appeared. The case law has neither burgeoned dramatically nor altered the scenery in major ways, although, it has added a few refinements. But important procedural and substantive wrinkles have appeared through 2003 statutory amendments to the steps probation officers must take in responding to probationers’ violations of the conditions of their probation sentences. 2 Less important changes appear in the county attorneys’ and trial courts’ responses. Probation remains a sentence under which a person found guilty of a crime or adjudicated delinquent or in need of special supervision is released subject to court imposed conditions and subject to supervision. 3 A probation sentence remains a final order for purposes of appeal. 4 However, upon proof of a violation {{of probation}}, the sentencing court may revoke the 2 ̆ 2 final 2 ̆ 2 probation sentence and impose a new sentence within the statutory limits or may decline to revoke probation and modify the terms of the probation sentence as originally imposed. 5 Probation revocation proceedings occupy a procedural class of their own with elements of both criminal and civil procedure. Even though probation revocation cannot occur without a precedent criminal proceeding and even though a new sentencing proceeding following a probation revocation is considered a critical stage of the precedent criminal case, the probation revocation proceeding itself is not considered to be a stage of the precedent criminal case. The basic rules governing probation revocations in Nebraska were developed by the Nebraska Legislature, the United States Supreme Court, the United States Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Nebraska Supreme Court, each body acting independently, as is the nature of our system, and sometimes adopting inconsistent approaches. The roles played by the United States Supreme Court and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals have faded substantially since 1989. 6 But the Nebraska Court of Appeals, which came into existence only in 1992, now plays a major role. In 1989 there was no other single reference work for discovering the esoteric rules relating to probation revocation in the state courts of Nebraska nor is there one in 2007. Hopefully, this article filled that void over the last eighteen years and will do so again for a reasonable length of time. Probation revocation is a narrow, specialized type of proceeding. Defense counsel are frequently thrust into probation revocation defense by court appointment. The area does not generate a great deal of fee activity. The income incentive for most lawyers to devote the necessary time to finding and synthesizing the law of probation revocation is not high. Yet, most alleged probation violators face imprisonment on revocation. The stakes are high for them. Actual probation violators are people who generally have put themselves on the fast track to correctional facilities. Once there, they have nothing to lose by filing liability claims against their former defense counsel. Following the constitutional Morrissey-Gagnon rules and Nebraska statutes is not optional and the failure to do so can affect negatively both any revocation proceedings and later criminal proceedings as well, as State v. Pawling 7 demonstrates. The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide to the bench, bar and probation officers a probation revocation primer with the dual goals of improving the quality of probation revocation representation (on both sides), as well as the quality of judicial probation revocation procedures and decision making, and offering a convenient basic reference on the law of probation revocation in Nebraska courts.

40|$|Certificate {{revocation}} {{is one of}} {{the many}} challenges faced by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Certificate <b>revocation</b> is the <b>action</b> of declaring a certificate, which has not expired, is no longer valid due to various reasons ranging from change of relationship between certificate issuer and the public key owner to compromised private keys of the associated certificate to change of information contained in the certificate. All the revoked certificates by the certificate issuer must be made available to all the end-entities, which need to verify a certificate. Many schemes have been proposed for certificate revocation; each with its own strenghts and weaknesses. Some of these schemes, although straightforward and easy to implement, suffer when faced with the challenge of efficient distribution of certificate revocation information. In this paper we look into the use of Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) technology to effectively and efficiently distribute the revoked information. P 2 P is an emerging paradigm that is now viewed as a potential technology that could re-formulate well known distributed architectures (e. g., the Internet). It is a network architecture in which all participating computers (or nodes), in most cases, have equivalent capabilities and responsibilities. Certificate revocation schemes such as Certification Revocation Lists, which has the potential to distribute very large list, will definitely benefit from the P 2 P implementation...|$|R
40|$|Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is {{increasingly}} popular as the security infrastructure {{of choice in}} corporate information systems and Internet applications. In particular, certificates are used to distribute public keys associated with the identity of its owner. One of the main concerns associated with PKI is that mechanisms for revocation of certificates are required. Certificate <b>Revocation</b> is the <b>action</b> of declaring a certificate invalid before its validity period is at an end. Investigations of PKI have demonstrated that the traditional means of certificate revocation are the most expensive part of a PKI system. In response to this problem, several different schemes and protocols have been suggested to provide more efficient certificate revocation. This thesis provides a survey and an analysis of existing schemes for public key certificate revocation. The analysis includes the traditional certificate revocation lists, protocols that provide on-line certificate revocation, as well as revocation systems with reduced data structures. Some techniques for improving the existing schemes are also suggested. Based on the analysis, the different schemes are compared in order to highlight advantages and disadvantages. A guideline for using this information in selecting a revocation solution is developed and applied to different example scenarios. This thesis is intended to provide a comprehensive background in certificate revocation {{as a basis for}} further research and development in the area, as well as a guide for PKI system developers in need of a certificate revocation system. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{certificate}} revocation in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) {{where there are no}} on-line access to trusted authorities is a challenging problem. In wired network environments, when certificates are to be revoked, certificate authorities (CAs) add the information regarding the certificates in question to certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and post the CRLs on accessible repositories or distribute them to relevant entities. In purely ad hoc networks, there are typically no accesses to centralized repositories or trusted authorities; therefore the conventional method of certificate revocation is not applicable. Certificate revocation {{is one of the many}} challenges faced by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

40|$|Correct {{certificate}} revocation practices {{are essential to}} each public-key infrastructure. While there exist a number of protocols to achieve revocation in PKI systems, there has been very little work on the theory behind it: Which different types of revocation can be identified? What is the intended effect of a specific revocation type to the knowledge base of each entity? As a first step towards a methodology {{for the development of}} reliable models, we present a graph-based formalism for specification and reasoning about the distribution and revocation of public keys and certificates. The model is an abstract generalization of existing PKIs and distributed in nature; each entity can issue certificates for public keys that they have confidence in, and distribute or revoke these to and from other entities. Each entity has its own public-key base and can derive new knowledge by combining this knowledge with certificates signed with known keys. Each statement that is deduced or quoted within the system derives its support from original knowledge formed outside the system. When such original knowledge is removed, all statements that depended upon it are removed as well. Cyclic support is avoided through the use of support sets. We define different revocation reasons and show how they can be modelled as specific <b>actions.</b> <b>Revocation</b> by removal, by inactivation, and by negation are all included. By policy, negative statements are the strongest, and positive are the weakest. Collisions are avoided by removing the weaker statement and, when necessary, its support. Graph transformation rules are the chosen formalism. Rules are either interactive changes that can be applied by entities, or automatically applied deductions that keep the system sound and complete after the application of an interactive rule. We show that the proposed model is sound and complete with respect to our definition of a valid state. Report code: LIU-TEK-LIC- 2006 :...|$|R
40|$|The patent {{system in}} Europe is still incomplete. Appropriating returns from {{patented}} technology is impaired {{by the fact}} that patent-holders may have to enforce their patent rights in multiple courts. Moreover, third parties interested in showing that particular patent rights have been granted erroneously are disadvantaged by having to initiate revocation proceedings in multiple jurisdictions. Given that the successful pursuit of these two objectives can generate welfare gains for the European economy, a unified European patent litigation system has immediate appeal. The current study seeks to provide approximate cost and benefit calculations in order to inform policy-makers in Europe about the choices they face in this important field of public policy. The study groups cost and benefit effects into the following categories: (i) effects from avoiding duplication of litigation; (ii) effects from changes in the demand for litigation, induced by changes in the cost structure; (iii) effects from changed incentives for patenting. Towards performing an assessment of the first two effects, the report collects data {{from a variety of sources}} in order to support the estimates and to test the plausibility of a number of necessary assumptions. Given that no official data on the incidence, outcomes and cost of patent litigation exist, an effort is made to triangulate data and estimates in order to demonstrate that the approximations are justified. The following results are particularly important. Avoiding duplication of infringement and revocation cases is likely to generate large benefits for the European economy. The results obtained here suggest that currently, between 146 and 311 infringement cases are being duplicated annually in the EU Member States. By 2013, this number is likely to increase to between 202 and 431 duplicated cases. Total private savings from having access to a unified Patent Court in 2013 would span the interval between EUR 148 and 289 million. An assessment of the operating costs of the proposed Patent Court is obviously subject to a large number of caveats. Based on data from earlier efforts (in particular the Working Party on Litigation set up under the auspices of the European Patent Organisation), an upper-bound estimate for the operating costs of a court with a capacity of 940 cases indicates that the Court would cause operating costs of EUR 27. 5 million. Hence, the cost-benefit assessment focusing on avoided duplication leads to a highly positive evaluation of the proposal. Even if the low estimate of savings (EUR 148 million) is taken, the new system would create substantial benefits and reach a benefit-cost ratio of 5. 4. However, this view may be unduly conservative, and the benefit-cost ratio could be as high as 10. 5. Additional benefits could flow in case of additional litigation activity, be it in terms of infringement or <b>revocation</b> <b>actions.</b> The availability of a low-cost litigation path offered by a unified Patent Court is likely to lead to additional activity from parties in countries which currently do not use the European patent system extensively. Moreover, the cost level of litigation in the unified Patent Court system is likely to be below the cost levels currently observed in some Member States and parties in these Member States are also likely to engage in more litigation activity in the medium-run. These effects will also contribute to generate private and public benefits. The above estimates and considerations are based on the assumption that the unified Patent Court will offer litigation at roughly the same cost level as the three largest low-cost national systems. In a robustness check, the report explores to what extent the gains from saved duplication would be dissipated if the cost level were higher. The computations show that even with a substantial average cost increase, benefit-cost ratios remain above one, and for most scenarios considerably above one. It is more difficult to predict cost-induced changes in the demand for litigation. The relevance of such changes will depend on the level and type of costs imposed on users of the new system. These will be mostly determined by the private costs for legal support and advice, but also by the fees levied by the Court itself. Measures to contain the private costs to parties in litigation are important, and the Presidency’s proposal includes a number of such measures which are discussed in the report with respect to their impact. A particularly promising measure is to admit representation of parties by specialized European Patent Attorneys. Another measure of importance is the contribution from the Community budget and from States which are not EU Member States to the Court’s budget, in order to keep fees at low levels. The report also discusses – in a qualitative manner – effects which emerge from changes in patenting and litigation incentives. It is argued that effects will be beneficial if the unified patent litigation system puts emphasis on fast and low-cost proceedings, high quality judgement, and a fair balance between the legitimate interests of patent holders and alleged infringers. It is emphasized that particularly strong positive welfare contributions can be expected if an effective and rapid, low-cost revocation procedure is available. The latter feature should provide an effective means against strategic and (possibly) frivolous litigation activity which could be mounted in the future by “patent trolls”. The report also comments on particular design choices in the Presidency’s proposal. To summarize, this report recommends strongly that the Presidency should proceed in its efforts to establish a unified and integrated patent litigation system for European patents and future Community patents. For conservative estimates of the relevant parameters, the economic benefits from such a system are likely to exceed the costs of the establishment and operation of the new court by a large multiple of between 5. 4 and 10. 5. Moreover, with prudent design choices it should be possible to implement a litigation system that will be balanced and supportive of overall efforts to improve the quality of patents in Europe...|$|R
