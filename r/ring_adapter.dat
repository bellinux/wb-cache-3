IBM communications adapters will be used as examples throughout. We will discuss the theory behind adapter performance tuning as we go. We will then discuss some workstation and networking hardware features, capacities, etc. that will affect final observed adapter performance. Finally, we will recommend some industry standard benchmarks that may be used to measure the performance resulting from the tuning process.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to design and measure the {{performance}} of two speed-independent asynchronous adapters for a communication architecture with distributed arbitration. The protocol is defined on the principles similar to those of the Token Ring but attempts to exploit the asynchronous design approach in improving the operational scalability of the system. Its two versions considered in this paper reflect the tradeoff between the greater functional capability and low-latency requirements. We show the power of Signal Transition Graphs in specifying, verifying and synthesizing the adapter's logic. Using timing information obtained at the implementation level, we finally estimate the performance of the token-ring architecture with point-to-point interconnection. keywords: arbitration, asynchronous systems, delay-insensitive communication, signal transition graph, speed-independent circuits, token <b>ring</b> <b>adapter</b> 1 Introduction The use of asynchronous logic seems unavoidable in applica [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Today TCP/IP is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used network protocol suite in the area of research and development. Taking into account this evolution the KFA Jülich installed the IBM TCP/IP software on the IBM ES 9000 / 620 with VM and MVS operating system and connected the mainframe to the local Internet as soon as appropriate products were available. Starting with an IBM- 8232 communication controller, and followed by an IBM 3172 model 1 the communication throughput to the IBM mainframe was extended. Installing the IBM 3172 model 2 should be a further step to high bandwidth. The announcement of new features of the IBM RISC/System 6000, particularly block multiplexer channel adapter to VM systems and FDDI single <b>ring</b> <b>adapter,</b> led to the questions regarding price/performance relationship of the RISC/System 6000 solution in comparison to an IBM 3172 model 2 and later on to an IBM 3172 model 3 communication controller solution. This report presents the results of some test series regarding the RISC/System 6000 / 32 H as an FDDI station and its operation as a BMPX to FDDI gateway. It further concludes with experiences in using two IBM RISC/System 6000 / 350 as BMPX to FDDI gateways for VM and MVS in a production environment.

40|$|The SA 1358 - 10 and SA 2052 - 4 {{circular}} JT Type plug connectors {{are used}} {{on a number of}} nuclear weapons and Joint Test Assembly (JTA) systems. Prototype units were evaluated for the following specific defects associated with the 95 Sn- 5 Sb (Sn-Sb, wt. %) solder joint used to attach the beryllium-copper (BeCu) spring fingers to the aluminum (Al) connector shell: (1) extended cracking within the fillet; (2) remelting of the solder joint during the follow-on, soldering step that attached the EMR <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> to the connector shell (and/or soldering the EMR shell to the <b>adapter</b> <b>ring)</b> that used the lower melting temperature 63 Sn- 37 Pb (Sn-Pb) alloy; and (3) spalling of the Cd (Cr) layer overplating layer from the fillet surface. Several pedigrees of connectors were evaluated, which represented older fielded units as well as those assemblies that were recently constructed at Kansas City Plant. The solder joints were evaluated that were in place on connectors made with the current soldering process as well as an alternative induction soldering process for attaching the EMR <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely the EMR <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely reflected the different extents to which the connector was mated to its counterpart assembly. In all cases, the spring finger solder joints on the SA 1358 - 10 connectors were remelted {{as a result of the}} subsequent EMR <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> attachment process. Spalling of the Cd (Cr) overplating layer was also observed for these connectors, which was a consequence of the remelting activity. On the other hand, the SA 2052 - 4 connector did not exhibit evidence of remelting of the spring finger solder joint. The Cd (Cr) layer did not show signs of spalling. These results suggested that, due to the size of the SA 1358 - 10 connector, any of the former or current soldering processes used to attach the EMR <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> and/or EMR shell to the connector shell, requires a level of heat energy that will always result in the remelting of the spring finger solder joint attached with either the Sn-Ag or the Sn-Sb alloy. Lastly, it was construed that the induction soldering process, which is used to attach the EMR <b>adapter</b> <b>ring</b> onto the shell, was more likely to have caused the remelting event rather than the more localized heat source of the hand soldering iron used to attach the EMR shell to the <b>adapter</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|R

40|$|Single-loop {{networks}} tend {{to become}} unreliable and tardy {{when the number of}} nodes in the network be-comes large. Fault tolerance and performance can be improved using double-loops. Because of different hop distances and cross-connections within one network highly reliable double-loop topologies are hardly extendable and adaptable to localities like buildings and floors. Another inconvenience is the modest per-formance improvement over single-loops. This paper presents an improved network archi-tecture which incorporates high reliability, high per-formance and optimal accommodation to environmental topologies. The investigated network is tree-shaped where the leaves represent host computers or loop sub-networks and the vertices are <b>ring</b> <b>adapters</b> attaching hosts or bridges interconnecting subnetworks. For ease of modeling only balanced and homogeneous structures are considered where loop subnetworks have the same topology. Multi-level hierarchical loop networks have minimal diameter when the number of nodes in the sub-networks is proportional to the root of the number of all attached stations. In this case the diameter grows only with the logarithm of the number of stations. This implies that network reliability and performance are significantly improved using the proposed multi-level hierarchical architecture based on loop subnetworks.

Within these frequency ranges the analytically determined resonance frequencies in this mansuscript are larger than that from the simulations. This is caused by a metallic <b>adapter</b> <b>ring,</b> which serves as planar impedance matching in the pMRP design.
