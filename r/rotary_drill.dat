50|$|The {{rotary hammer}} drill (also known as a rotary hammer, roto hammer drill or masonry drill) {{combines}} a primary dedicated hammer mechanism with a separate rotation mechanism, and is used for more substantial material such as masonry or concrete. Generally, standard chucks and drills are inadequate and chucks such as SDS and carbide drills that {{have been designed to}} withstand the percussive forces are used. Some styles of this tool are intended for masonry drilling only and the hammer action cannot be disengaged. Other styles allow the drill to be used without the hammer action for normal drilling, or hammering to be used without rotation for chiselling. In 1813 Richard Trevithick designed a steam-driven <b>rotary</b> <b>drill,</b> also the first drill to be powered by steam.|$|E

The essential assets of Hughes Tool Company (as it was renamed) were August 10, 1909 patents for his dual-cone <b>rotary</b> <b>drill</b> bit. The fees for licensing this technology were the basis of Hughes Tool's revenues, and by 1914 the dual-cone roller bit was used in eleven U.S. states and in thirteen foreign countries.

50|$|The Ultrasonic/Sonic Driller/Corer (USDC) is a {{drilling}} device that uses vibrations {{in order to}} hammer its bit through materials, as opposed to traditional drilling methods. The drill uses a piezoelectric actuator as its source of power, and utilizes a variety of 'horns' to vibrate, or hammer, its bit through the material. A prototype of the drill was first released by NASA in April 2000, which weighed 1.5 lb. (.7 kg) and {{had the capacity to}} drill half-inch holes into granite using only 10 watts of power, whereas the modern household half-inch drill requires 750 watts. The USDC was originally designed to be able to drill through very rigid rock surfaces that would otherwise be damaged by a <b>rotary</b> <b>drill,</b> but has also shown potential usefulness to the field of medicine. It is the specific characteristics of the drill that make it ideal or practical for certain situations.|$|E

Returning to play a more central role in Hughes Tool in the 1940s, Hughes Jr. diversified the company's holdings by expanding into filmmaking, aviation, and the casino industry in Las Vegas, although his father's core tool manufacturing business remained by far the company's chief source of revenue. In 1972, by which time Hughes Tool had become widely diversified, Hughes Jr. sold the nucleus tool division and realized $150 million from the sale. In 1987, Hughes Tool merged with Baker International to form Baker Hughes, a large oilfield services company still based in Houston.|$|E
50|$|Exploration diamond {{drilling}} differs from other geological drilling (see Drilling rig) in that a solid core is extracted from depth, for examination on the surface. The key {{technology of the}} diamond drill is the actual diamond bit itself. It is composed of industrial diamonds set into a soft metallic matrix. As shown in the figure, the diamonds are scattered throughout the matrix, and the action relies on the matrix to slowly wear during the drilling, so as to expose more diamonds. The bit is mounted onto a drill stem, which is connected to a <b>rotary</b> <b>drill.</b> Water is injected into the drill pipe, so as to wash out the rock cuttings produced by the bit and also to reduce the heat produced due to friction which causes less wear and tear of the bits. An actual diamond bit is a complex affair, usually designed for a specific rock type, with many channels for washing.|$|E

40|$|First online: 13 January 2016 Rock {{drilling}} Penetration Rate (PR) {{is influenced}} by many parameters including rock properties, machine parameters of the chosen rig and the working process. Five datasets were utilized to quantitatively assess the effect of various rock properties on PR. The datasets consisted of two sets of diamond and percussive drilling and one set of <b>rotary</b> <b>drilling</b> data. A new rating system called Rock Drillability Characterization index (RDCi) is proposed to predict PR for different drilling methods. This drillability model incorporates {{the uniaxial compressive strength}} of intact rock, the P-wave velocity and the density of rock. The RDCi system is further applied to predict PR in the diamond <b>rotary</b> <b>drilling,</b> non-coring <b>rotary</b> <b>drilling</b> and percussive drilling. Strong correlations between PR and RDCi values were observed indicating that the developed drillability rating model is relevant and can be utilized to effectively predict the rock drillability in any operating environment.
