5|$|In mid-2001, Universal Music Group {{was criticized}} for airing {{commercials}} promoting the album during episodes of Total Request Live. Manson suspected that former Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman {{played a role in}} the criticism. Lieberman and Hillary Clinton had <b>recently</b> <b>introduced</b> the Media Marketing Accountability Act before the United States Congress. This legislation proposed to ban the entertainment-industry from marketing suspected violent or explicit material to minors.|$|E
5|$|In central Europe, {{this species}} has been <b>recently</b> <b>introduced</b> in the Austrian Danube, {{where it was}} first {{recorded}} in Tulln, Lower Austria in 2001. In the Czech Republic, it is now extinct in Bohemia; the only findings were in the Elbe river near Litoměřice in 1917, {{and the most recent}} findings of empty shells took place in 1943. Theodoxus fluviatilis also occurs in Poland, in Slovakia where it is non-indigenous since 2002, and in Hungary. Zettler (2008) provided a detailed bibliography of the distribution of T. fluviatilis in Germany. The indigenous distribution of T. fluviatilis included all of the large rivers: Rhine, Main, Moselle, Neckar, Weser, Elbe and Oder. However, this species is now highly endangered in Germany (Stark gefährdet).|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} since the Tornado's introduction, {{all of the}} Tornado {{operators}} have undertaken various upgrade and modification programmes to allow <b>recently</b> <b>introduced</b> weapons {{to be used by}} their squadrons. Amongst the new armaments that the Tornado has been adapted to deploy are the enhanced Paveway and Joint Direct Attack Munition bombs, and modern cruise missiles such as the Taurus and Storm Shadow missiles; these upgrades have increased the Tornado's capabilities and combat accuracy. Precision weapons such as cruise missiles have replaced older munitions such as cluster bombs.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the team had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, who had worked with Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had <b>recently</b> <b>introduced</b> a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E
5|$|Clyde Fenton, {{known for}} his {{exploits}} as a flying doctor in the Northern Territory before being commissioned as a pilot in the RAAF, served as an instructor at No.3 EFTS from mid-1940 to early 1942. King was posted to command No.5 EFTS at Narromine, New South Wales, in December 1940. By this time No.3 EFTS was reported as having graduated 200 pilots in the eight flying training courses it had run since its formation. One of its graduates was Nicky Barr, who become a fighter ace in the North African Campaign with twelve victories to his credit. No.3 EFTS began operating a ground-based Link Trainer on 17February 1941. The school started flying the <b>recently</b> <b>introduced</b> CAC Wackett Trainer in August 1941, but the type proved troublesome, delaying the training program. From September to November 1941, a detachment of personnel from No.11 EFTS also utilised training facilities at Essendon, after their home aerodrome at Benalla had been inundated by heavy rain. No.3 EFTS's instructors, students and Wackett Trainers were transferred to No.11 EFTS during April 1942, and the Essendon school was disbanded on 1May.|$|E

5|$|During 2013 {{took place}} {{a surge in}} sales of plug-in hybrids in the European market, {{particularly}} in the Netherlands, with 20,164 PHEVs registered during the year. Out of the 71,943 highway-capable plug-in electric passenger cars and utility vans sold in the region during 2013, plug-in hybrids totaled 31,447 units, representing 44% of the plug-in electric vehicle segment sales that year. This trend continued in 2014. Plug-in hybrids represented almost 30% of the plug-in electric drive sales {{during the first six}} months of 2014, and with the exception of the Nissan Leaf, sales of the previous European best selling models fell significantly, while <b>recently</b> <b>introduced</b> models captured a significant share of the segment sales, with the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, Tesla Model S, BMW i3, Renault Zoe, Volkswagen e-Up!, and the Volvo V60 Plug-in Hybrid ranking among the top ten best selling models.|$|E
5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had <b>recently</b> <b>introduced</b> its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{young woman}} named Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) begins a new career at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary. She is excited {{to be working in}} Manhattan, but finds herself {{overwhelmed}} by her new surroundings. The office manager, Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), a voluptuously beautiful and capable woman, proves more intimidating than helpful as she gives advice on how to be appealing to the men of the office and how that will lead to both success in the office and a good marriage. Peggy is dismayed to find a secretary in the bathroom crying. A junior account executive named Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) makes boorish comments about Peggy's appearance and clothing, causing Don to rebuke him. On her break, Peggy goes to the office of a doctor recommended by the all-knowing Joan, where she gets a prescription for the <b>recently</b> <b>introduced</b> birth control pill, which at the time was not supposed to be prescribed to unmarried women or married women without their husband's consent. Later in the day, Peggy makes a subtle, sexually inviting gesture to Don, but he definitively rejects her advances.|$|E

5|$|Morchella frustrata fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or {{in small}} groups in spring, in mountainous forests and maquis. The exact trophic status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been <b>recently</b> <b>introduced</b> from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe. Kuo suggests {{that it might be}} also widely distributed in western North America, but so far has only been confirmed to be present in Oregon and California.|$|E
5|$|Ten months later, {{she became}} editor of US Vogue. Under Mirabella, {{it had become}} more focused on lifestyles {{as a whole and}} less on fashion. Industry {{insiders}} worried that it was losing ground to the <b>recently</b> <b>introduced</b> American edition of Elle. After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn't fit).|$|E
5|$|The {{recession}} of 1969-1970 greatly affected Boeing. For {{the year and}} a half after September 1970 it only sold two 747s in the world, and did not sell any to an American carrier for almost three years. When economic problems in the United States and other countries after the 1973 oil crisis led to reduced passenger traffic, several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 economically, and they replaced them with the smaller and <b>recently</b> <b>introduced</b> McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijet wide bodies (and later the 767 and A300/A310 twinjets). Having tried replacing coach seats on its 747s with piano bars in an attempt to attract more customers, American Airlines eventually relegated its 747s to cargo service and in 1983 exchanged them with Pan Am for smaller aircraft; Delta Air Lines also removed its 747s from service after several years. Later, Delta acquired 747s again in 2008 as part of its merger with Northwest Airlines, although it intends to retire them from service by 2018.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid {{introduced}} the Rule of Saint Benedict into the monasteries he founded. It appears {{likely that he}} was the first to introduce the Benedictine Rule into England, as evidence is lacking that Augustine's monastery at Canterbury followed the Rule. He also was one of the first Anglo-Saxon bishops to record the gifts of land and property to his church, which he did at Ripon. Easter tables, used to calculate the correct date to celebrate Easter, were brought in from Rome where the Dionysiac Easter tables had been <b>recently</b> <b>introduced.</b> He set up schools and became a religious advisor to the Northumbrian queen Æthelthryth, first wife of Ecgfrith. Æthelthryth donated the land at Hexham where Wilfrid founded a monastery and built a church using some recycled stones from the Roman town of Corbridge. When Wilfrid arrived in York as bishop the cathedral's roof was on the point of collapse; he had it repaired and covered in lead, and had glass set in the windows.|$|E
