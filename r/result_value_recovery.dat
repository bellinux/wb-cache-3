40|$|When disjoining a log, {{several factors}} affect {{the value of}} the sawn timber. There are log features, such as outer shape, knots, rot, and so on. There are also sawing parameters, such as sawing pattern, log position, and so on. If full {{information}} about log features is available, sawing parameters can be adapted in order to maximize product value in sawmills. This is soon possible, since computed tomography (CT) scanners for the sawmill industry are being realized. This study aimed at investigating how CT data can be used to choose rotational position, parallel displacement, and skew of sawlogs, to maximize {{the value of the}} sawn products. The study was made by sawing simulation of 269 CT scanned logs of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies [L. ] H. Karst.). The <b>results</b> showed that <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> could be improved by 13 % in average, compared to a sawing position based on log outer shape, and 21 % compared to sawing logs centered and horns down.

40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scanning of logs {{is being}} introduced in sawmills, {{so there is}} reason to study how log positioning can be controlled using information from CT. However, positioning errors affect this positioning optimization in a negative way. To reduce this effect, a method was developed using sawing simulation, where logs were sawn in a large number of positions, varying rotation and centering. This resulted in three-dimensional surfaces, with the sawn timber value, rotation and centering on the axes. The surfaces were filtered with a Gaussian filter using a distribution corresponding to that of the positioning error. The filtered values were used for optimization, choosing the global maximum. This <b>resulted</b> in a <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> that was about two percent higher compared to a simpler optimization without filtering, for a normally distributed rotational error of 5 – 15 ° standard deviation and a ditto centering error of 3. 5 – 10. 5 mm standard deviation. This was tested using sawing simulation, using the optimal log position for the two methods, with an added positioning error. Furthermore, the robust method has been tested on a smaller number of rotational positions, starting from horns down, {{to reduce the number of}} necessary calculations. The result of this was that at least ± 60 ° in the rotational direction should be evaluated for the robust method to result in a higher recovery than the simpler optimization.

40|$|The New Zealand forest {{industry}} produces a {{diverse range of}} log grades and sorts to meet domestic and export market demands and to maximise returns to the forest grower. An implication for the supply chain {{is the number of}} log grades and sorts a harvesting operation is expected to produce from one species, radiata pine (Pinus radiata). The number of log grades and sorts can impact on landing size and layout requirements, <b>value</b> <b>recovery,</b> log-making complexity, machine utilisation and quality control requirements. A study was conducted to investigate if the number of log sorts affects mechanised log processing productivity and <b>value</b> <b>recovery.</b> This would determine if any gross value gains derived from producing a higher number of sorts are offset by losses in log processing productivity. Two landing-based mechanised log processors at cable yarder harvesting operations were studied using different cutting scenarios producing five, nine, twelve and fifteen log sorts. The study collected data from over 26 hours of mechanised processing which included the processing of 578 stems at an average piece size of approximately 1. 6 m³. Machine utilisation results showed processors spending 84 % of total time on productive tasks and that 49 % of total time was spent on the primary productive tasks of log processing. Quadratic regressions were used to model log processing productivity trends which showed piece size and cutting scenario as significant predictor variables (p-value < 0. 01). There was a significant difference between cutting scenario with five log sorts and the cutting scenarios with twelve and fifteen log sorts (p-values < 0. 05), as well as {{a significant difference between the}} nine and fifteen log sort cutting scenarios (p-value < 0. 01). There was not enough evidence to suggest productivity was different between cutting scenarios producing five and nine log sorts. Based on this analysis, it was likely that the null hypothesis that the number of log sorts does not affect log processing productivity should be rejected. At a piece size of 2 m³, the productivity model estimated processing productivity was 10 % higher producing nine log sorts compared to producing fifteen log sorts. A linear regression model showed a strong relationship between gross <b>value</b> <b>recovery,</b> piece size and cutting scenario (p-value < 0. 01). Gross <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> increased as the number of log sorts increased. A significant model suggested it is likely null hypothesis 2, that the number of log sorts does not affect gross <b>value</b> <b>recovery,</b> should be rejected. There were only some differences in variances between cutting scenarios which were statistically significant. Both the average results and regression estimates showed the five log sort cutting scenario recovering 94 % of the value of the cutting scenario with fifteen log sorts. Incremental gains in <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> as the number of log sorts increased were marginal, which appeared to be due to log prices for many major log grades trading in a close range in relation to historic price trends. Regression trends for productivity and gross <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> indicated that the most optimal cutting scenario, in terms of processing value outturn per productive machine hour, was the cutting scenario producing nine log sorts. This suggests that declines in processor productivity offset gains in gross <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> when producing twelve and fifteen log sorts. Market sensitivity analysis suggested that differentials in log prices impact on the number of log sorts which optimise the value outturn per productive machine hour from log processing...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Contract harvest {{operations}} {{have become the}} preferred approach to reducing the largest cost component of timber production through free market competition amongst logging contractors bidding or negotiating for work. The goal {{of this research was}} to investigate economic components of harvesting operations not previously studied for steep slope thinning harvests in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands. This research explored three important issues affecting Pacific Northwest costs and revenues. On the expense side, mobilization costs associated with wildlife protections restricting harvest operating seasons were modeled for nine Siuslaw National Forest timber sales. Mobilization costs resulting from seasonal restrictions imposed for nesting of northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) and marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) were 1. 48 to 2. 60 per 100 cubic feet (1 Ccf) for an array of sale volumes, cut tree sizes, and one-way mobilization distances. Total sale costs ranged from 7000 to 43000, depending on the number of mobilizations required. With respect to income, two studies were performed to evaluate revenue improvement through bucking-to-value strategies. The first evaluated a reduced set of log lengths that approach computer-generated optimal values and the potential for development of a bucking decision tool. The second sought value optimization with a log allocation constraint through the application of a combinatorial heuristic approach for the reduced set of log lengths to create the bucking pattern cutting card. A reduced set of five log lengths, two mill-length logs and three woods-lengths resulting from combinations of the mill-lengths, was evaluated for <b>value</b> <b>recovery.</b> <b>Resulting</b> <b>values</b> obtained 96 to 98 percent of full set optimal values for 45 and 65 year old stands, respectively. <b>Value</b> <b>recovery</b> exceeded current unaided bucking practices.

The SA generated bucking solutions improved <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> by 2. 61 to 2. 73 per Ccf while meeting the preferred log allocation. The resulting bucking patterns were easily incorporated into a cutting card based on length to merchantable top.

There is constant pressure to explore new resources to meet the ever increasing demand posed by growth in population and that of industry in urban cities. Introduction of unconventional resources such as wastewater and greywater reuse, allows access to a readily available valuable resource and intrinsic <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> {{for the benefit of}} society. Not only does this assist with fresh water resource conservation and optimal use thereof and mitigation of negative impacts but also closing of urban nutrient loops and extraction of chemical energy for energy generation. This research explores wastewater intrinsic <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> at wastewater treatment plant and wastewater management system levels as part of the balancing equation of natural-unconventional resource use and environmental, social and economic constraints. A methodology for assessment of wastewater intrinsic <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> was developed that derive a monetary equivalent of <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> of reuse employing an econometric production function approach. Apart from a economic level life cycle analysis, the methodology developed include a holistic multi-criteria analysis (MCA) covering sustainability criteria related to the economic, technical, social and environmental domains. The methodology can be adopted to analyse the economic effects of choices between the different pathways of wastewater intrinsic <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> or a combination thereof and performance differences between surface and ground water reclamation strategies. The methodology allows strategic level comparative analyses of wastewater management system options within the centralised-decentralised wastewater continuum and appropriate technology option choices, being demonstrated for sewered technology in the second case study of the research. It is concluded that wastewater beneficiation or intrinsic <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> consists of three different pathways of reclamation, reuse and recycle, each being location specific with different social, environmental and economic repercussions. While reuse positively impact virtual water components and water footprints, modification to allow multiple water use is needed to apply the concept in wastewater management. By quantifying the impact of reuse on water availability for urban water supply systems the link between reuse level and resource conservation benefits is established. The main recommendations made include the exploring of shadow prices and contaminant removed at treatment and management system levels over multiple time periods. In addition, sustainability of extended system scale and technology options over the centralised-decentralised wastewater continuum and returns to scale of urban sewered systems within a South African context require investigation. The adoption of the methodology is also proposed to analyse the economic impacts of wastewater beneficiation pathways or combinations thereof, additional benefits of multiple water use and ways of adjustment of the virtual water (VW) concept to be more amenable to wastewater management. Furthermore, impact of reuse on increased water availability for urban water supply systems by incorporating a network-specific and consumer-end related system losses differentiation as link to resource conservation benefits assessment is also recommended...|$|R

Comparisons were made on the basis of <b>value</b> <b>recovery,</b> harvesting productivity and costs, and land taken out of production by landings. A field trial indicated that <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> at the landing was better than at the stump but the magnitude of difference was dependent on individual log manufacturers. Better <b>value</b> <b>recovery</b> on the landing was generally due to more logs meeting specification and more accurate length measurements. Radiata pine stems are too long to be hauled to a central processing yard without some initial cuts being made at the stump. Initial cuts preempt future log manufacturing decisions. An analysis of fixed long length patterns indicated that about 5 ? of possible value would be foregone by these preemptive cuts. To analyse the effect of alternative log manufacturing locations on harvesting productivity and costs a stump-to-milldoor simulation model was constructed. Tree-length logging to large landings was the most productive and least costly alternative, the stump was the second best alternative, and the central processing yard was the most expensive and least preferred alternative. In an overall economic analysis it was concluded that where possible large landings and yarders should continue to be used.
