Each sample (40  µg) was analyzed by 15  % sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Then the membrane was blocked by 5  % bovine serum albumin for 2  h. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4  °C with 1 : 1000 dillution of PDCD 5 (Abcam, Shanghai, China) and β-actin (ZSJQB Co., Ltd. Beijing, China) antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase conjugated second antibodies (1 : 2000 dilution, ZSJQB Co., Ltd. Beijing, China) for 1  h at room temperature. After washing, the signals were visualized by an ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) western blotting detection system according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

The results obtained with E 6 and E 7 RIPA were related to clinico-pathological data from cervical carcinoma patients positive for HPV type 16 DNA in their primary tumour. The data obtained with E 6 and E 7 RIPA were then compared to the results obtained using the E 7 / 6 - 35 synthetic-peptide ELISA. The prevalence of antibodies to E 6, E 7, E 6 and/or E 7 and E 6 and E 7, as determined by RIPA, was significantly higher in cervical cancer patients than in both controls and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia patients. Odds ratios, calculated for cervical carcinoma patients versus controls, ranged from 7. 4 to 15. 4. Antibodies to E 6 and/or E 7 were largely restricted to patients with HPV DNA in their primary tumour. Analysis {{of the relation between}} prevalence of antibodies to E 6 and E 7 and clinico-pathological parameters was limited to 85 patients positive for HPV- 16 DNA.

40|$|Myasthenia gravis is an {{autoimmune}} disease {{which may be}} detected {{by the presence of}} serum antibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. <b>Immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assays</b> have been developed to measure these immunoglobulins and calculate titres. These assays require the labelling of the receptor with 125 I-alpha-bungarotoxin which binds irreversibly. However, the standard <b>immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assay</b> may significantly underestimate the titres of some myasthenic patients. We have discovered patients with antibodies specific for the alpha-bungarotoxin binding site of purified rat muscle receptor.

KCTD7 mRNA and protein are expressed in hippocampal neurons, deep layers of the cerebral cortex and Purkinje cells of the murine brain as shown by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry experiments. <b>Immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assays</b> demonstrates that KCTD7 is able to prudhommerie and directly interacts with cullin-3 (CUL3), {{a component of the}} ubiquitin ligase complex. These interactions are thought to be mediated via the BTB/POZ domain of KCTD7. However, KCTD7 does not show any interaction cullin-1 (CUL1). <b>Immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assays</b> also shows that KCTD7 does not interact with Ubiquitin-flag, suggesting a potential role of KCTD7 in the ubiquitin ligase complex without being itself subject to uiquitination.

In this study we report an <b>immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assay</b> for the detection of autoantibodies to these three enzymes using in vitro 35 S-labelled antigens. Overall, 33 out of 46 (72 %) patients with APS I had autoantibodies to {{at least one of the}} three proteins and each protein was recognized by patient sera with equal frequency. A higher rate of autoantibody positivity was observed in APS I patients with Addison's disease compared with patients without Addison's disease (85 % versus 39 %). All 11 patients with ovarian failure had anti-P 450 c 17 or anti-P 450 scc antibodies. The immunoprecipitation results with P 450 c 17, P 450 c 21 and P 450 scc correlated well with the results obtained by immunoblotting assays. In addition, the steroidogenic enzymes 11 β-hydroxylase (P 450 c 11 β), aromatase (P 450 arom), 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 βHSD) and adrenodoxin were studied by <b>immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assay,</b> but no reaction was found either with 46 APS I or with 26 healthy control sera. To study the suggested immunological cross-reactivity between P 450 c 17 and P 450 c 21 enzymes, nine APS I patient sera were preabsorbed with bacterially expressed P 450 c 17 or P 450 c 21 and subsequently used in <b>immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assay.</b> The absorption experiments clearly indicated that the preincubation inhibited only the reactivity of corresponding antigen, suggesting independent autoantibody response to the two enzymes.

40|$|The {{antibody}} response {{against an}} amastigote-specific protein (A 2) from Leishmania donovani was investigated. Sera from patients with trypanosomiasis and {{various forms of}} leishmaniasis were screened for anti-A 2 antibodies. Sera from patients infected only with L. donovani or Leishmania mexicana specifically recognized the A 2 recombinant protein. These results were consistent with karyotype analyses which revealed that the A 2 gene is conserved in L. donovani and L. mexicana strains. The potential of this antigen in diagnosis was further explored by screening a series of sera obtained from patients in regions of the Sudan and India where L. donovani is endemic. The prevalence of anti-A 2 antibodies was determined by Western blotting for all samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an <b>immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assay</b> were also performed {{on some of the}} samples.

IB assays performed under nonreducing conditions {{were compared with}} those performed under reducing conditions and with <b>immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assays.</b> Significant loss of antigenicity (greater than 90 %) of RV E 1 and E 2 proteins was observed when IB assays were performed {{in the presence of}} 2 -mercaptoethanol as compared with assays under nonreducing conditions. In contrast, the antigenicity of RV capsid protein was not influenced by reducing agents. Sensitivity of IB for RV-specific IgG antibodies was determined to be 0. 01 IU/ml under nonreducing conditions. In the determination of RV-specific IgM and IgA antibodies by IB, pretreatment of serum with protein G to remove competing high-affinity RV-specific IgG or rheumatoid factor significantly improved assay sensitivity. IB assays were observed to be superior to <b>immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assays</b> in their ability to better define the specificities of RV-specific antibodies and to detect antibodies of all immunoglobulin classes.

40|$|The {{recruitment}} of transcriptional coactivators, including histone modifying enzymes, {{is an important}} step in transcription regulation. A typical activator is thought to interact with several cofactors, presumably in a sequential manner. The common use of several cofactors raises the question of how activators achieve both cofactor selectivity and diversity. Human STAGA is a multiprotein complex with the acetyltransferase GCN 5 L as the catalytic subunit. Here, we first show, through RNA interference-mediated knock-down and chromatin <b>immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assays,</b> that GCN 5 plays a role in p 53 -dependent gene activation. We then employ p 53 mutagenesis, in vitro binding, protein-protein cross-linking, and chromatin <b>immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assays</b> to establish a novel role for the second p 53 activation subdomain (AD 2) in STAGA recruitment and, further, to demonstrate that optimal binding of STAGA to p 53 involves interactions of STAGA subunits TAF 9, GCN 5, and ADA 2 b, respectively, with AD 1, AD 2, and carboxy-terminal domains of p 53. These results provide concrete evidence for mediation of transcription factor binding to coactivator complexes through multiple interactions.

The ensuing nuclear translocation of their N-termini (i. e., ATF 6 (N) and SREBP(N)) activates the respective target genes involved in unfolded protein response and lipogenesis. Here, {{we report that}} glucose deprivation activated ATF 6 but suppressed the SREBP 2 -regulated transcription. Overexpression of ATF 6 (N) had similar inhibitory effects on SREBP 2 -targeted genes. The blockade of ATF 6 cleavage by BiP/grp 78 reversed this inhibitory effect. GST pull-down and <b>immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assays</b> revealed that ATF 6 (N) bound to SREBP 2 (N). Deletion analysis of the various functional domains of ATF 6 indicated that the interaction was through its leucine-zipper domain. Chromatin <b>immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assays</b> revealed that ATF 6 (N) formed a complex with the SRE-bound SREBP 2 (N). The attenuated transcriptional activity of SREBP 2 was due, in part, to the recruitment of HDAC 1 to the ATF 6 –SREBP 2 complex. As a functional consequence, the lipogenic effect of SREBP 2 (N) in liver cells was suppressed by ATF 6 (N).
