5|$|Metabolism {{involves}} {{a vast array}} of chemical <b>reactions,</b> but most fall under a few basic types of <b>reactions</b> that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different <b>reactions.</b> These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer <b>reactions</b> is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E
5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical <b>reactions.</b> There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic <b>reactions</b> generate ATP, and anabolic <b>reactions</b> consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation <b>reactions.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{chemical}} <b>reactions</b> of metabolism {{are organized}} into metabolic pathways, {{in which one}} chemical is transformed {{through a series of}} steps into another chemical, by a sequence of enzymes. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable <b>reactions</b> that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous <b>reactions</b> that release energy. Enzymes act as catalysts that allow the <b>reactions</b> to proceed more rapidly. Enzymes also allow the regulation of metabolic pathways in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} abundance of 14N and 15N is practically constant {{in the atmosphere}} but can vary elsewhere, due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological redox <b>reactions</b> and the evaporation of natural ammonia or nitric acid.

These <b>reactions</b> typically result in 15N enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product.|$|E
50|$|In organic chemistry, the Fujiwara-Moritani <b>reaction</b> {{is a type}} of cross {{coupling}} <b>reaction</b> where an aromatic C-H bond is directly coupled to an olefinic C-H bond, generating a new C-C bond.

An external oxidant is required to this <b>reaction</b> to be run catalytically. Thus, this <b>reaction</b> can be classified as a C-H activation <b>reaction,</b> an oxidative Heck <b>reaction,</b> and a C-H olefination.

5|$|Archaea {{exhibit a}} great variety of {{chemical}} <b>reactions</b> in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These <b>reactions</b> are classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these <b>reactions</b> one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells.|$|E

5|$|Catabolism is {{the set of}} {{metabolic}} {{processes that}} break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic <b>reactions</b> is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic <b>reactions</b> which build molecules. The exact nature of these catabolic <b>reactions</b> differ from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon (their primary nutritional groups), {{as shown in the}} table below. Organic molecules are used as a source of energy by organotrophs, while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates, and phototrophs capture sunlight as chemical energy. However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on redox <b>reactions</b> that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as organic molecules, water, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions to acceptor molecules such as oxygen, nitrate or sulfate. In animals, these <b>reactions</b> involve complex organic molecules that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water. In photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, these electron-transfer <b>reactions</b> do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.|$|E
