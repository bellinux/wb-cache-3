40|$|Four-row {{cylindrical}} roller bearings having pin-type steel cage and pronged machined solid brass cage are commonly used in the back-up <b>roll</b> <b>assembly</b> of cold rolling mills. The present article briefs about these bearings and investigates the root cause failure of such gigantic (inner ring ID = 865 mm, inner ring OD = 945 mm; outer ring ID = 1073. 0 mm, outer ring OD = 1180 mm) four-row {{cylindrical roller}} bearings. In the present study, a visual examination of failed rolling surfaces has been emphasized. An analytical approach has been utilized to determine the maximum load on the roller and the outer ring raceway interface. The maximum principal normal and shear stresses have been evaluated for coefficients of friction equal to 0. 001, 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3. A three-dimensional static finite element analysis has been performed to explain the cracking {{of the outer ring}} of the bearing. Condition monitoring based on oil analysis is adopted to validate the conclusions drawn from the finite element analysis of roller bearings...|$|E

40|$|For {{effective}} manufacturing of a doubly curved {{sheet metal}}, a novel {{sheet metal forming}} process is proposed. The suggested process uses a Line Array Roll Set (LARS) composed {{of a pair of}} upper and lower <b>roll</b> <b>assemblies</b> in a symmetric manner. The process offers flexibility as compared with the conventional manufacturing processes, because it does not require any complex-shaped die and loss of material by blank-holding is minimized. LARS allows flexibility of the incremental forming process and adopts the principle of bending deformation, resulting in a slight deformation in thickness. Rolls composed of line array roll sets are divided into a driving roll row and two idle roll rows. The arrayed rolls in the central lines of the upper and lower <b>roll</b> <b>assemblies</b> are motor-driven so that they deform and transfer the sheet metal using friction between the rolls and the sheet metal. The remaining rolls are idle rolls, generating bending deformation with driving rolls. Furthermore, all the rolls are movable in any direction so that they are adaptable to any size or shape of the desired three-dimensional configuration. In the process, the sheet is deformed incrementally as deformation proceeds simultaneously in rolling and transverse directions step by step. Consequently, it {{can be applied to the}} fabrication of doubly curved ship hull plates by undergoing several passes. In this work, FEM simulations are carried out for verification of the proposed incremental forming system using the chosen design parameters. Based on the results of the simulation, the relationship between the roll set configuration and the curvature of a sheet metal is determined. The process information such as the forming loads and torques acting on every roll is analyzed as important data for the design and development of the manufacturing system...|$|R
