40|$|Bleached wool {{is rapidly}} yellowed by {{exposure}} to the UV radiation present in sunlight. The conventional application of a water-soluble hydroxyphenyl benzotriazole UV absorber (such as UVFast W) to bleached wool reduces its rate of photoyellowing but has {{a negative impact on}} the whiteness of the bleached wool, largely cancelling out the improvements in whiteness achieved during bleaching. However, if the UV absorber is applied to peroxide-bleached wool from a <b>reductive</b> <b>bleach</b> bath, white wool with improved photostability to sunlight and UV radiation can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} process for the {{industrial}} scale bleaching of possum fur. Research was undertaken into the bleaching of possum with regard to whiteness of final fur, damage occurring to fur and prevention of matting to fur. A process was supplied consisting of kill, mordant, oxidative <b>bleach,</b> strip and <b>reductive</b> <b>bleach</b> steps. This process produced fur with a loss of around 9. 5 % and alkali solubility of around 70 %. Improvements made to this process gave a loss of around 5 % and alkali solubility of around 50 %. The main alterations made to the process were (i) Changing the reducing agent and pH of the mordant and lengthening this stage. (ii) Altering the temperature, time and pH of the oxidative bleach. (iii) Shortening the strip stage (iv) Altering the reagent system of the <b>reductive</b> <b>bleach</b> The displacement bleaching system used was found to be successful in preventing matting of the fibre provided care is taken in transferring the wet fur for drying. The main difficulty encountered in scaling up the laboratory process was a compression of the fur during oxidative bleaching resulting in a build up of pressure and flow problems through the fur. This {{is due in part to}} the hollow nature of possum fibre which gives it a large degree of buoyancy and the swelling of the fibres during oxidative bleaching. Changes in the surface chemistry of the fibres occurring during oxidative bleaching are also thought to play some part since these problems are not encountered with fibre which has undergone a successful oxidative bleach. These problems were countered by using a shallower bed of fur for bleaching, reducing the flowrate through the fur and reducing the temperature of the oxidative bleach to give a more gradual bleach. These modifications allowed the successful bleaching of a 3. 5 kg batch of fur. A larger scale pilot plant for the bleaching of 15 kg batches was constructed. An attempted run on this plant using the conditions developed in the smaller plant was unsuccessful. It was specified that the lid on the top of the plant be clamped in place however this was not undertaken as a cost and time saving measure. This then came unstuck during bleaching leading to the overflow of the vessel. Further work is required to optimise the lower temperature oxidative bleach. With this undertaken it is recommended that the lid be clamped into place on the larger plant and the design parameters determined on the smaller plant verified before further scale-up is attempted. A full scale plant could not be constructed within the time frame of the project...|$|R
40|$|The chlorine-Hercosett {{process has}} been {{dominant}} in the wool shrink-proofing industry for more than 30 years. Hypochlorite breaks the hydrophobic nature of wool surface; Hercosett (cationic polyamide epichlorhydrin resin) covers wool and prevents wool from shrinking. From today's modem point of view, however, the chlorineHercosett process shows a number of drawbacks which make the search for an ecologically clean alternative worthwhile: poor handle, yellowing of wool, difficulties in dyeing and most importantly today, environmental impact (rdlease of absorbable organic halogens- AOX to the effluents). As a result, many researches {{have been carried out}} for Non-AOX rapid oxidation of wool. Potassium peroxomonosulphate (PMS), hydrogen peroxide and some per acids have been concerned as possible alternatives, but only little commercial successes. It was well known that Hercosett will not deposit on the PMS or hydrogen peroxide treated wool. The key difference. in terms of polymer compatibility between chlorinated and PMS, hydrogen peroxide treated wool is the surface energy (wettability). Surface energy has influence on the spreading properties of Hercosett and wool/polymer interfacial adhesion. Resent researches have shown that this difference is associated with the removal of a fatty acid (lipid), namely IS-methyleicosanoic acid (IS-MEA), which is thought to be chemically bound to the surface of wool fibre by a thio-ester linkage. In common words, chlorination can remove this fatty acid but PMS and hydrogen peroxide treatments can not. The wool shrink-proofing research in this thesis is f<?cused on wool delipidisation. Total delipidisation (97 % of the IS-MEA was removed) is achieved by a cationic surfactant/nucleophile process. During the treatement, hydrophobic complexes between the cationic surfactant and nucleophile are formed which can diffuse into the wool lipid shell. The nucleophile will attack the eletrophilic thio-ester linkage of the wool lipid and liberate the free lipid as its carboxylate salt into water. The wool top after delipidisation, oxidative sulphitolysis and Hercosett 125 treatment shows some significant shrink resist properties when compared to the untreated wool fibre. The same wool top was spun, knitted and wash tested using the standard TM 31 wash test procedure. Such wool fabric has passed 3 x 5 A wash cycles. It was also worth mentioning that the same wool fabric has soft handle and bright shade when compared to the chlorine-Hercosett treated wool. Wool bleaching and photo-yellowing are also important subjects in wool research. The proportion of wool which is bleached is approximately IO% of the total world production. The photo-yellowing effect of ~unlighton bleached wool is greater than on untreated wool. The relationship ofwool bleaching and wool photo-yellowing is studied. FTIR studies shows that there are more wool disulphide bonds cleaved during the reduction bleaching than the oxidation bleaching. The photo-yellowing effect of sunlight on the <b>reductive</b> <b>bleached</b> wool is greater than on the oxidative bleached wool. The reduction in wool cystine residue content is a key effect in preventing photo-yellowing in bleached wool. The decomposition reaction of urea to isocyanic acid and the subsequent reaction of isocyanic acid with nucleophiles such as the hydroxyl groups in cotton cellulose are studied. The properties of the modified. carbamoylated cellulose have been investigated including the ease of bleaching it when tea stained and its dyeing properties with reactive dyes. The reaction of wool nucleophiles with isocyanic acid derived from sodium cyanate was studied. The properties of the modified wool were investigated. A novel method of colormetric labelling of the tyrosine residues was developed to follow the extent of modification oftyrosine in wool using isocyanic acid.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of trials to evaluate the color-stripping behaviour of offset printing colors and the effect of coating on deinking performance. Oil-based four-color inks were separately printed as base printing on coated and uncoated white poster paper, and then extensive pulping and deinking processes were carried out. Standard offset printings were conducted on paper samples using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black colors (CMYK), and the effects of deinking efficiency on the removal of each color were analysed. The pulps were made at Micro-Maelstrom Laboratory Pulper at specified conditions with and without bleaching agents. Formamidin sulfinic acid and hydrogen peroxide formulation were used as <b>reductive</b> and oxidative <b>bleaching</b> agents, respectively. Flotation deinking and thickening of pulp were practiced using Degussa flotation and thickening cell. The changes in the optical properties, such as brightness, whiteness, and color value (CIE L⃰, a⃰ b⃰) of deinked pulp were determined. It was found that optical properties of color-stripped pulps from coated papers were better than that of uncoated office papers.

An approach able {{to provide a more}} gradual release of water to the supports is needed. Using Gellan gum as gelling agent to optimise the presence of water and minimise the impact on the paper supports during cleaning treatments, this method was developed. The Gellan gum method can be used also for deacidification as well as for <b>reductive</b> <b>bleaching</b> pourposes. Different analyses were carried out to assess the suitability and the effectiveness of cleaning treatments of paper artifacts. Some of these were conducted by water immersion, some others by cellulose ethers contact or by Gellan gum rigid gels contact. In particular, colourimetric analysis was performed to quantify colour modification. Microscopy investigations (including SEM) were employed to observe the structural modification possibly occurred on the paper surface. In order to compare the effectiveness of chemical stabilisation treatments, pH and alkaline reserve measurements were performed. During the experiment, modern paper samples and original artifacts - considered "expendable" - are used. Based on the acquired experience, results on three cases of studies are also presented. Results show that the treatment by contact (Gellan gum) is a viable alternative to traditional methods of restoration in terms of effectiveness and safety. Moreover, Gellan gum gel is manageable, easy to use, inexpensive and respectful of the unique characteristics of the archival and librarian artifacts. Concerning deacification and <b>reductive</b> <b>bleaching,</b> better results were obtained using Gellan gum as carrier for aqueous solutions with calcium propionate and borane terz-butylamine complex. This method provides an increase of pH values comparable to that achieved by immersion. Furthermore, it leaves an appreciable amount of alkaline reserve on the paper support.

40|$|Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a ôancer {{treatment}} involving {{selective retention}} of a photoactive drug in tumour cells and tissue. Subsequent illumination with {{light of the}} correct wavelength can result in tumour destruction, generally assumed to be mediated by singlet oxygen (102) generated by the light-excited drug. Among such compounds, the biological stains methylene blue and toluidine blue 0, both phenothiazinium derivatives, have been widely studied {{with respect to their}} use in PDT and potential antimicrobial applications. However, studies of novel methylene blue derivatives (MBD) for PDT are scarce in the literature. We have synthesised a range of novel phenothiazinium derivatives, in particular 3, 7 -disubstituted analogues and explored the use of electrochemical methods in assessing their potential efficacy in PDT. A range of phenothiaziniums were synthesised by oxidation of the appropriate precursor phenothiazines by iodine and were characterised for synthetic purposes by infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, ultravioletvisible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and thin layer chromatographic techniques.

40|$|The acid {{hydrogen}} peroxide system {{has the potential}} to significantly reduce the specific energy consumption in the production of softwood thermomechanical pulps (TMPs). A drawback of the chemical system is discoloration of the pulp during refining. The work presented in this study evaluates the possibility to regain the lost brightness by washing, chelating and sodium dithionite or {{hydrogen peroxide}} bleaching of the treated pulps. A washing or chelating procedure can reduce the metal ion content of the chemically treated TMPs considerably, though brightness can be increased by a maximum of two ISO units. The amount of iron can be further reduced to a level similar to that of untreated pulps by performing a reducing agent-assisted chelating stage (Q(Y)) with dithionite. The discoloration cannot,, however, be completely eliminated. The brightness decrease-of the treated pulps is thus not only caused by higher iron content in the pulp, but is also dependent on the type of iron compound and/or other coloured compounds connected with the acid hydrogen peroxide treatment. Oxidative bleaching with hydrogen peroxide (P) is more effective than <b>reductive</b> <b>bleaching</b> with sodium dithionite in regaining the brightness lost during the energy reductive treatment.

40|$|Calcination, is {{the process}} of heating a substance, to a {{temperature}} below its fusing point, with a resultant loss of water. It {{is one of the most}} important techniques currently used to enhance the properties, and therefore value, of kaolin. The overall aim of this project was to provide a better understanding of the principles of the kaolin calcination reaction in order to enhance the efficiency, quality and sustainability of the Imerys calcining operations. This research has shown a strong correlation between the chemistry of kaolin and the colour of the calcined product. This is due to the influence of contaminant materials on the colour of the hydrous kaolin, which in turn affects the calcined material. The strongest colour influencing factor is the presence of iron, particularly if it is present on the surface of the kaolin. Surface iron is currently reduced using a <b>reductive</b> <b>bleaching</b> process. This has an improving influence on even the most contaminated kaolins, however there can be quite a lot of interbatch variability. Despite its effect on colour the chemistry of kaolin has little influence on post calcination reactivity. Reactivity is due to physical factors such as particle and agglomerate size and the penetration of heat into the material. Any kaolin will calcine to produce a low reactivity product; provided the heat is able to penetrate into the bed and that the material is able to remain at temperature for sufficient time for the calcination reaction to occur. Another outcome of the research was the discovery that a higher temperature and shorter time period has little on the end calcined product but has implications for lower energy usage...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of using acid hydrogen peroxide under Fenton conditions {{to lower the}} electrical energy consumed during the production of Black spruce (Picea mariana) thermomechanical pulp (TMP) was investigated. The chemical system, which consisted of ferrous sulphate, hydrogen peroxide and optionally an enhancer (3, 4 -dimethoxybenzyl alcohol, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or oxalic acid/sodium oxalate), was evaluated as an inter-stage treatment where the primary refiner {{was used as a}} mixer. The produced TMPs were thoroughly characterised in order to explain the effect of the chemical system on fibre development {{and to be able to}} propose a mechanism for the impact on refining energy reduction. The possibility to improve the optical properties by washing, chelating and sodium dithionite or hydrogen peroxide bleaching the treated pulps was evaluated.   The results obtained in a pilot plant trial show that it is possible to significantly reduce the comparative specific energy consumption by approximately 20 % and 35 % at a freeness value of 100 ml CSF or a tensile index of 45 Nm/g by using 1 % and 2 % hydrogen peroxide respectively. The energy reduction is obtained without any substantial change in the fractional composition of the pulp, though tear strength is slightly reduced, as are brightness and pulp yield. No major differences between the reference pulp and the chemically treated pulps were found with respect to fibre length, width or cross-sectional dimensions. However, the acid hydrogen peroxide-treated pulps tend to have more collapsed fibres, higher flexibility, a larger specific surface area and a lower coarseness value. The yield loss accompanying the treatment is mainly a consequence of degraded hemicelluloses. It was also found that the total charge of the chemically treated pulps is higher compared to the reference pulps, something that may have influenced the softening behaviour of the fibre wall.   A washing or chelating procedure can reduce the metal ion content of the chemically treated TMPs considerably. The amount of iron can be further reduced to a level similar to that of untreated pulps by performing a reducing agent-assisted chelating stage (QY) with dithionite. The discoloration cannot, however, be completely eliminated. The brightness decrease of the treated pulps is thus not only caused by higher iron content in the pulp, but is also dependent on the type of iron compound and/or other coloured compounds connected with the acid hydrogen peroxide treatment.

40|$|Modern {{manufacturing}} processes assume efficient utilization and recycling {{of natural resources}} whenever possible. Over the past decade paper recycling has progressed from 33. 5 % in 1990 to just above 48 % in 2002. 1 Indeed, for certain select grades, (newspaper and old corrugated containers) greater than 70 % is currently being recycled. In contrast, mixed office waste and colored directory papers are often underutilized. A major difficulty in recycling these grades of paper is {{the problems associated with}} decolorizing the dyes present in the paper. 2 Of the commonly used paper dyes, the stilbene dye Direct Yellow 113 and methine dye Basazol 46 L are notorious 4 for poor bleachability with the commonly used chemical bleaching agents including chlorine dioxide, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and sodium dithionite. The ability of white-rot fungi to decolorize colored effluents containing textile dyes is currently the subject of intensive research efforts. The secreted enzymes involved in dye decolorization include manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase and laccase. Laccase, a lignolytic enzyme, has also been studied for many years for the biobleaching of wood pulps. The ability of laccase to delignify pulp is greatly enhanced by the addition of small molecule mediators such as 2 - 2 ´ azinobis (3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonate) (ABTS) and 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT). This research project focused on applying laccase combined with a mediator to decolorize C. I. Direct Yellow 11 and Basazol 46 L. Three mediators were tested: ABTS, HBT and violuric acid. Laccase/ABTS was most effective with 60 % of the color being removed. The level of color removal was maintained at 60 % even when ABTS concentration was lowered from 5 mM to 0. 01 mM. When laccase/ 1 mM ABTS was applied to Direct Yellow 11 in solution, the majority of color loss occurred within 60 minutes. The ability of soybean (SBP) and horseradish (HRP) peroxidases and laccase to decolorize Direct Yellow 11 and Basazol 46 L in solution was also examined. The results demonstrated that these two recalcitrant dyes could be effectively decolorized by enzymatic treatments by horseradish peroxidase, soybean peroxidase, and laccase with ABTS as mediator. SBP is effective from pH 4. 5 to 8. 5. The stilbene dye Direct Yellow 11 responded to both SBP and laccase/ABTS. For the methine dye Basazol 46 L, SBP was a more effective treatment than HRP or laccase/ABTS. Basazol 46 L responded quickly to SBP treatment with 74 % reduction in signal intensity within 5 minutes. To evaluate the effectiveness of laccase/ABTS treatment, pulp dyed with Direct Yellow 11 and three commercial colored pulps were subjected to seven different bleaching treatments. These treatments consisted of 1) laccase/ABTS; 2) laccase/ABTS followed by alkaline extraction; 3) laccase/ABTS followed by bleaching with sodium dithionite; 4) oxygen bleaching; 5) oxygen bleaching followed by dithionite treatment; 6) alkaline hydrogen peroxide bleaching; and 7) alkaline peroxide bleaching followed by dithionite treatment. The best results were obtained by including <b>reductive</b> <b>bleaching</b> with sodium dithionite. For Direct Yellow 11 dyed pulp, laccase/ABTS followed by dithionite yield comparable reduction in color to oxygen or peroxide followed by dithionite. Ph. D. Dr. A. J.

The possibility to improvethe optical properties by washing, chelating and sodium dithionite or hydrogenperoxide bleaching the treated pulps was evaluated. The system of lignocellulosicmaterial, a Norway spruce (Picea abies) TMP, and Fenton chemistry was alsoevaluated in a model study to understand more about how conditions such as e. g. initial pH, dissolved organic material and reaction time affect the reactions. Ferrous and ferric ions (free and chelated) and different anions were evaluated. Moreover, it was examined whether hydroxyl radicals could be detected andmonitored. The results obtained in pilot scale showed that it is possible to significantly reducethe specific energy consumption by approximately 20 % and 35 % at a freenessvalue of 100 ml CSF or a tensile index of 45 Nm/g by using 1 % and 2 % hydrogenperoxide respectively. The energy reduction was obtained without any substantialchange to the fractional composition of the pulp, although tear strength wasslightly reduced, as were brightness and pulp yield. No major differences betweenthe reference pulp and the chemically treated pulps were found with respect tofibre length, width or cross-sectional dimensions. However, the acid hydrogenperoxide-treated pulps tended to have more collapsed fibres, higher flexibility, alarger specific surface area and a lower coarseness value. The yield lossiiiaccompanying the treatment was mainly a consequence of degradedhemicelluloses. It was also found that the total charge of the chemically treatedpulps was higher compared to the reference pulps; something that may haveinfluenced the softening behaviour of the fibre wall. A washing or chelating procedure could significantly reduce the metal ion contentof the chemically treated TMPs. The amount of iron could be further reduced to alevel similar to that of untreated pulps by performing a reducing agent-assistedchelating stage with dithionite. The discoloration could not, however, becompletely eliminated. The brightness decrease of the treated pulps was thereforenot only caused by the greater iron content in the pulp, but was also dependent onthe type of iron compound and/or other coloured compounds connected with theacid hydrogen peroxide treatment. Oxidative bleaching using hydrogen peroxidewas more effective than <b>reductive</b> <b>bleaching</b> using sodium dithionite in regainingthe brightness that was lost during the energy reductive treatment. From the model study and by using a chemiluminescence method, it could beconcluded that hydroxyl radicals were present in the system of Fenton chemicalsand lignocellulosic material (TMP). Initial pH, retention time, pulp consistency,type of catalyst (free or chelated) and dissolved organic material had an impact onthe reactions between TMP and acid hydrogen peroxide. Different anions(sulphate, nitrate and chloride) of ferric ion salt gave a similar catalytic effect. There appeared to be more reactions with the TMP when there was less dissolvedorganic material in the liquid phase from the start. A catalyst of ferrous sulphatehad a greater impact on the pulp (increased total fibre charge and carbonyl groups,more dissolved organic material in filtrate) than ferric ions chelated withethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at an initial pH of about 3 - 7. If using ferric-EDG(ethanol diglycinic acid) as catalyst, the measured effect on the pulp was similar orless compared to using ferrous sulphate. Ferric-EDG, however, gave higherhydrogen peroxide consumption and more detectable hydroxyl radicals than usingferrous sulphate (initial pH 5 - 8). It is likely that the iron catalyst must bind to theTMP, or be in close proximity to it, for the hydroxyl radicals to be able to react withthe material. A mechanism was proposed: the hydroxyl radicals generated in the Fentonreaction will probably attack and oxidise the available outer fibre surfaces,weakening these layers, and simultaneously dissolve some of the organic material. This can facilitate fibre development, give a better bonding pulp and reduce theelectrical energy required during refining...|$|E
