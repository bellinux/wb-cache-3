25|$|The {{circuit and}} Grand Prix were first {{proposed}} {{in the middle of}} 2010. The circuit was the first in the United States to be purpose-built for Formula One. The layout was conceived by promoter Tavo Hellmund and 1993 Motorcycle World Champion Kevin Schwantz with the assistance of German architect and circuit designer Hermann Tilke, who has also designed the Sepang, Shanghai, Yas Marina, Istanbul, Bahrain, Yeongam, and Buddh circuits, as well as the <b>reprofiling</b> of the Hockenheimring and Fuji Speedway. The circuit has FIA Grade 1 license.|$|E
500|$|Protective wind nets by {{the side}} of the hill were later {{installed}} in Harrachov for 1996 to minimise the effects of crosswind, along with major <b>reprofiling</b> of the slope to comply with FIS safety regulations. This <b>reprofiling</b> – particularly at the hill's highest point, known as the 'knoll' – was critical in reducing the fearsome height reached by athletes after takeoff, verified to be [...] in 1980. Thanks to these modifications, athletes no longer jumped with as much height as before and no major accidents have occurred in Harrachov since 1992.|$|E
500|$|Between the [...] and 2007 races, the Circuit de la Sarthe was upgraded, most {{obviously}} by the <b>reprofiling</b> of the Tertre Rouge corner. The new corner was moved inward, {{to create a}} long flowing curve instead of the single point apex it had been previously, shortening the lap distance by 21 meters to a revised 13.629km. A new pedestrian tunnel– below the Mulsanne Straight, immediately after Tertre Rouge– was also built. The work had been planned {{to be carried out}} before the 2006 event, but it was delayed because of budgetary concerns.|$|E

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1996, Fratton Park became an all-seater stadium. The Milton End terrace was <b>reprofiled</b> and blue plastic seats were installed.|$|R
5000|$|Spa {{underwent}} {{track changes}} as well, {{with a new}} paddock area, a <b>reprofiled</b> Bus Stop Chicane, {{an extension of the}} start-finish straight and a change to La Source hairpin.|$|R
500|$|Technical {{regulations}} for 2012 include the <b>reprofiling</b> of the car's nose. The pre-2012 regulations allowed the nose {{to be as}} high as [...] above ground, but the revisions to the sporting code lowered the maximum allowable height to [...] 150mm ahead of the front bulkhead. This resulted in cars being launched with a [...] "platypus" [...] nose, as teams designed cars with a visible change in height along the nose assembly of the car. Mercedes AMG team principal Ross Brawn explained the distinctive nose shape as having come about from [...] "several teams" [...] wanting to use their 2011 chassis as the basis for their 2012 cars.|$|E
500|$|Following the ride's {{opening it}} had several {{modifications}} and renovations, which included <b>reprofiling</b> {{parts of the}} ride, shortening the seven-car trains to six-car trains, and performing maintenance on the wooden track. Six Flags Over Texas performed over [...] of trackwork on the ride in the 2008–2009 offseason, with the ultimate aim of improving the ride's smoothness. Although the maintenance did improve the ride, park officials needed a more permanent solution. Initial speculation indicated the ride would be removed entirely from the park; however, Six Flags Over Texas denied any intention or consideration to do so. In March 2009, the park announced the closure of Texas Giant prior to a $10 million renovation. Following Fright Fest for that year, the ride closed on November 1, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] {{reduction}} in height {{from the original}} [...] height was required by the Network Rail OLE regulations, and was achieved by a redesign of the dome and safety valve mountings on the boiler, and by <b>reprofiling</b> of the cab roof and chimney.|$|E
50|$|McNish had a {{dramatic}} accident at the 130R corner while practising for the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, but escaped serious injury. This {{led to the}} corner being <b>reprofiled</b> the following year.|$|R
50|$|For the 2009 race, {{the circuit}} was <b>reprofiled</b> slightly, {{including}} modifications to turns 1, 2 and 3 to aid overtaking, and also at turn 10 where high kerbs caused many accidents in 2008.|$|R
50|$|Tires are {{reasonably}} thick, about 3 inches, giving {{plenty of room}} for wear. Worn tires or tires with flats are <b>reprofiled</b> on a wheel lathe if there is sufficient thickness of material remaining.|$|R
2500|$|While {{civilian}} drones do generally match {{humans in}} intelligence, drones built especially as Contact or Special Circumstances agents are often several times more intelligent, and imbued with extremely powerful senses, powers and armaments (usually forcefield and effector-based, though occasionally more destructive weaponry such as lasers or, exceptionally, [...] "knife-missiles" [...] are referred to) all powered by antimatter reactors. Despite being purpose built, these drones are still allowed individual personalities {{and given a}} choice in lifestyle. Indeed, some are eventually deemed psychologically unsuitable as agents (for example as Mawhrin-Skel notes about itself in The Player of Games) and must choose (or choose to choose) either mental <b>reprofiling</b> or demilitarisation and discharge from Special Circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|The {{staff was}} {{directed}} to formulate an updated policy, which was accomplished on 22 May 2014 with a report entitled [...] "The Fund's Lending Framework and Sovereign Debt: Preliminary Considerations", and {{taken up by the}} Executive Board on 13 June. The staff proposed that [...] "in circumstances where a (Sovereign) member has lost market access and debt is considered sustainable ... the IMF would be able to provide Exceptional Access {{on the basis of a}} debt operation that involves an extension of maturities", which was labelled a [...] "reprofiling operation". These <b>reprofiling</b> operations would [...] "generally be less costly to the debtor and creditors—and thus to the system overall—relative to either an upfront debt reduction operation or a bail-out that is followed by debt reduction ... (and) would be envisaged only when both (a) a member has lost market access and (b) debt is assessed to be sustainable, but not with high probability ... Creditors will only agree if they understand that such an amendment is necessary to avoid a worse outcome: namely, a default and/or an operation involving debt reduction ... Collective action clauses, which now exist in most—but not all—bonds, would be relied upon to address collective action problems." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{construction}} of a large bulk carrier Giuseppe Lembo in 1994, the shipyard <b>reprofiled</b> its activity to construct only small ships. Only after the privatisation in 2002 the shipyard restarted to construct large scale ships.|$|R
50|$|The Rhencullen {{complex of}} bends {{including}} Birkin's Bend {{was subjected to}} road widening and <b>reprofiling</b> {{during the winter of}} 1953/1954 for the 1954 TT races.|$|E
50|$|Protective wind nets by {{the side}} of the hill were later {{installed}} in Harrachov for 1996 to minimise the effects of crosswind, along with major <b>reprofiling</b> of the slope to comply with FIS safety regulations. This <b>reprofiling</b> - particularly at the hill's highest point, known as the 'knoll' - was critical in reducing the fearsome height reached by athletes after takeoff, verified to be 15 - 18 m in 1980. Thanks to these modifications, athletes no longer jumped with as much height as before and no major accidents have occurred in Harrachov since 1992.|$|E
50|$|The {{unit was}} renamed to 38 SCE on 29 April 2009 {{following}} its <b>reprofiling</b> {{as an active}} Armoured Engineer unit. The battalion's motto is Steadfast and Gallant, with the African Elephant as its mascot.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Holiday World {{initially}} {{announced plans}} to have new Timberliner trains ready and operating for the 2012 season. However, the park stated that because the new trains would not be delivered in time for pre-opening testing, {{they would not be}} ready in time for the 2012 season. The park now plans on having the Timberliner trains operating {{by the beginning of the}} 2013 season. In addition to routine track work, Holiday World, in conjunction with the Gravity Group, rebuilt and <b>reprofiled</b> portions of the ride's turn around, which is commonly referred to as the [...] "spaghetti bowl". As a result of the <b>reprofiled</b> turn, an additional 0.1 second of air-time was created, bringing the ride's new total to 24.3 seconds of air-time.|$|R
50|$|Force India {{introduced}} a revised floor and diffuser in Bahrain for the Force India VJM02, {{as well as}} an upgraded front wing and <b>reprofiled</b> sidepods. Force India driver Giancarlo Fisichella welcomed the upgrades, hoping the car's lack of downforce would be addressed by the new modifications.|$|R
5000|$|A {{special edition}} of the X25XE was worked by Motor Sports Developments (MSD); which {{includes}} <b>reprofiled</b> camshafts, giving the engine a boost of [...] This engine appeared in two special edition Vauxhall Vectras, first the Vectra ST200 (Not the normal SuperTouring), and then the Vectra 2.5 GSi V6.|$|R
50|$|This {{would be}} the last motor race on the {{original}} high-speed Silverstone circuit; the day after the race, a construction crew funded by Tom Walkinshaw immediately began work on <b>reprofiling</b> and incorporating the newly designed corners.|$|E
50|$|Bagnall 3079 was {{withdrawn}} in 1989 {{due to the}} increased shunting being beyond its capabilities. Replaced by chop-nosed DA 512, it was provisionally sold to the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway who planned to have it towed by rail to their Kawakawa depot. Unfortunately NZ Rail Ltd was concerned that the tyres needed <b>reprofiling</b> and wanted the locomotive to be road transported to Westfield depot in Auckland for this work to be carried {{before it could be}} moved by rail. Unable to meet the cost of transporting the locomotive and <b>reprofiling</b> the tyres, the BoIVR were unable to move the locomotive and it was later scrapped at Kinleith in 1990.|$|E
50|$|The Gorse Lea {{section of}} road {{including}} Ballagarraghyn and the Gorse Lea corner {{was subjected to}} road widening and <b>reprofiling</b> {{during the winter of}} 1952/1953 by the Isle of Man Highway Board for the 1953 Isle of Man TT Races.|$|E
30|$|The {{measurements}} were {{done on the}} molasse sandstone and on an adjacent block of the same stone <b>reprofiled</b> {{with a layer of}} repair material. Figure  6 shows the proximity of the measurements, with the dimensions of the repair layer (12  cm width and 26  cm height for 2  cm thickness).|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Kancil underwent two minor facelifts. In 1997, the car's grille and bumpers {{were better}} integrated to support {{to a larger}} grille and rounded indicator lights. In 2000, the car was given another slight facelift consisting of body-coloured side mouldings, a new grille and <b>reprofiled</b> front bumper with larger indicators.|$|R
50|$|The LU3 also {{received}} a quiet cam to help reduce vibration at both idle and high engine speeds. This camshaft used the same lift and duration as the older design, but the cam was <b>reprofiled</b> to keep the valve lifters in full contact with the cam lobes as the cam ramps down.|$|R
50|$|A 1 in {{reduction}} in height {{from the original}} 13 ft height was required by the Network Rail OLE regulations, and was achieved by a redesign of the dome and safety valve mountings on the boiler, and by <b>reprofiling</b> of the cab roof and chimney.|$|E
50|$|In January 2007, CAT {{licensed}} {{the drug}} {{for treatment of}} allergy disorders to iCo Therapeutics Inc. iCo Therapeutics Inc. is a Vancouver-based <b>reprofiling</b> company focused on redosing or reformulating drugs with clinical history for new or expanded indications - a so-called 'search and development company'.|$|E
50|$|The corner {{underwent}} road widening and <b>reprofiling</b> {{during the}} winter of 1953/1954 for the 1954 TT races. From the winter of 2003 to 2006, road repair work was carried-out on the primary A3 road from Barregarrow to Cronk-y-Voddy, including Handley's Corner and the 11th Milestone, by the Department of Transport.|$|E
