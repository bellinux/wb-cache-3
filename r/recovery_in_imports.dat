40|$|Uruguay’s First Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement and Request for Modification of Performance Criteria are discussed. Growth {{has slowed}} from the strong post-crisis recovery, and {{inflation}} has remained subdued. Export {{growth has been}} strong, and although a sharp <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> <b>imports</b> contributed {{to an increase in}} the external current account deficit, capital inflows have helped raise international reserves. The government is developing a broad agenda of growth-enhancing reforms, focused on attracting more private investment as the key engine of future growth and social progress in Uruguay.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Uruguay’s Request for a Stand-By Arrangement. Although {{the external}} current account shifted to a moderate deficit, mainly reflecting the <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> <b>imports,</b> export performance has been robust, and {{gross international reserves}} are now about three-fourths their pre-crisis level. The authorities’ program appropriately focuses on fiscal consolidation keeping inflation low through prudent monetary policy, promoting sound credit flows in a strengthened financial system, and other growth-oriented reforms. Key to maintaining macrostability will be achieving sufficiently large primary surpluses over the medium term to keep the public debt on a firm downward path.

André Hofman, Chief of the Economic Projections Centre (ECP), was in charge of technical coordination and for conducting the study. The assistance of the national and subregional offices and of the ECLAC Economic Development Division was much appreciated. The views expressed in this document, which have not been formally edited, are the sole responsibility of the working group and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Organization. Starting this year, the Centre for Economic Projections at ECLAC's Statistics and Economic Projections Division, publishes the Atlas of Growth in Latin America and the Caribbean (Last update: July 2006). This new product is an interactive graphical version of the main Economic Projections Document, which will provide immediate and user-friendly access to the individual growth projections for the countries in the region. Summary: The gross domestic product (GDP) of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean will grow by 4. 6 % in 2006, up slightly from 2005. This could lead to an increase of more than 3 % in per capita GDP, stemming from continuing strong domestic demand, as well as from an external sector that will continue to be driven by lively world trade, spearheaded by the Asian economies. The region's average growth rate is expected to fall slightly in 2007 by approximately half a percentage point, chiefly because Argentina and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela will have completed their recovery. The Latin American economies will grow at fairly similar rates in 2006, by between 3 % and 6 %, with the exception of Argentina and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which will grow by more than 6 %. As in previous years, the Southern Cone (Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay) and the Andean Community are projected to be the regions with the highest growth rates, with 6. 9 % and 5. 7 % respectively. Mexico and Central America are expected to experience lower growth than Latin America in 2006, following the trend of recent years. However, the gap is closing and the subregion is expected to grow by around 3. 6 %. The inflation rate for Latin America and the Caribbean in 2006 is forecast to be much the same as in 2005, in the order of 5 % to 7 %, owing to cost pressures associated with energy prices, that will feed into prices somewhat belatedly. In 2006, as in 2005, the current account is expected to remain in surplus, although not by as much, owing to a continuing <b>recovery</b> <b>in</b> <b>imports</b> associated with strong domestic demand. In the world context, in 2006 the United States' growth rate is forecast to be slightly lower than in 2005, whereas the average growth rates for Japan and Europe are expected to be higher. This will stem from slightly more restrictive macroeconomic policies in the United States, together with sustained growth in domestic demand in both China and Japan. Furthermore, the worst of the contractive effect of high oil prices on the world economy is thought to have already occurred in 2005. This year, growth in the United States and Japan is forecast to be around 3 %, whereas in the European Union it will be between 1. 5 % and 2 %. Based on these factors, there are good grounds for expecting the positive terms-of-trade trend to continue, especially for countries exporting oil or metallic minerals. In Central America and the Caribbean, where most countries are oil importers, a negative trend in trade terms is projected...|$|E

The empirical investigation finds that firms that <b>imported</b> <b>in</b> both 2009 and 2010 are much more important for the import dynamics than import starters and import stoppers. Firms that increased their imports (and that were the drivers of the import boom) imported on average more goods and from more countries of origin in 2009 than firms that decreased their imports, and they increased both extensive margins of imports on average while firms with decreased imports reduced both the number of goods exported and the number of countries of origin...|$|R

Our findings are summarized as follows.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide the {{analytical}} background of North Korea's trade expansion with Western countries in the early 1970 's and examine in depth the resulting impacts on the North Korean economy.

As a result of researching North Korea's economic trajectory during the 1970 's within this focus, this study asserts that, despite some positive aspects, North Korea's rapid increase of foreign trade in recent years possesses the immanent possibility of generating serious obstacles to the process of economic <b>recovery.</b> <b>In</b> this vein, this paper intends to explore some policy options North Korea should choose in order to create conditions conducive to economic rehabilitation and prevent the recurrence of similar situation as experienced in the 1970 's. ...|$|R
