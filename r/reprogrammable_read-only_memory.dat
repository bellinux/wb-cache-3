Given the acronym DIFMOS for dual-injector floating-gate MOS, this technology utilizes the floating-gate technique for nonvolatile storage of data. Avalanche injection of hot electrons through gate oxide from a special injector diode in each bit {{is used to}} charge the floating gates. A second injector structure included in each bit permits discharge of the floating gate by avalanche injection of holes through gate oxide. The overall design of the DIFMOS bit is dictated by the physical considerations required {{for each of the}} avalanche injector types. The end result is a circuit technology which can provide fully decoded bit-erasable EAROM-type circuits using conventional manufacturing techniques...|$|R

50|$|Typically {{micro-controller}} {{programs must}} {{fit in the}} available on-chip memory, since it would be costly to provide a system with external, expandable memory. Compilers and assemblers are used to convert both high-level and assembly language codes into a compact machine code for storage in the micro-controller's memory.

50|$|A {{programmable}} <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (PROM) or field programmable <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (FPROM) or {{one-time programmable}} non-volatile memory (OTP NVM) {{is a form}} of digital memory where the setting of each bit is locked by a fuse or antifuse. It is one type of ROM (<b>read-only</b> <b>memory).</b> The data in them is permanent and cannot be changed. PROMs are used in digital electronic devices to store permanent data, usually low level programs such as firmware (microcode). The key difference from a standard ROM is that the data is written into a ROM during manufacture, while with a PROM the data is programmed into them after manufacture. Thus, ROMs tend to be used only for large production runs with well-verified data, while PROMs are used to allow companies to test on a subset of the devices in an order before burning data into all of them.|$|R
