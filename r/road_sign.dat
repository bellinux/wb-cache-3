25|$|Though {{the systems}} based on photoresistors evolved, growing more compact and {{moving from the}} {{dashboard}} to a less conspicuous location behind the radiator grill, they were still unable to reliably discern headlamps from non-vehicular light sources such as streetlights.

American inventor Jacob Rabinow devised and refined a scanning automatic dimmer system impervious to streetlights and reflections, but no automaker purchased the rights, and the problematic photoresistor type remained on the market through the late 1980s.|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} LucasArts {{adventure}} games, Full Throttle is a single-player video {{game in which}} the player controls {{the actions of the}} player character from a third-person perspective using a computer mouse and point and click interface. By positioning the cursor and clicking the left mouse button, the player causes the player character, Ben, to move around a scene. In certain contexts the cursor will become an arrow (if Ben is on foot) or a directional <b>road</b> <b>sign</b> (if Ben is riding his motorcycle); clicking these causes Ben to travel to another scene. As with other LucasArts graphic adventure games of the era, dialogue plays a large part in the game, presenting story elements and information necessary to advance. During conversations with other characters, several choices of dialogue are presented. The currently selected choice is highlighted, and once clicked, the player character responds with the selected choice. Choosing the correct response allows the player to advance the conversation and ultimately advance the scene.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 {{the cost}} of {{converting}} road signs from miles to kilometres in the United Kingdom {{was estimated to be}} between £7½ and £8½ million (1978 prices).
