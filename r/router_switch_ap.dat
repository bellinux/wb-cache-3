30|$|Resource {{management}} in networking entails controlling the vital {{resources of the}} network, including CPU, memory, disk, <b>switches,</b> <b>routers,</b> bandwidth, <b>AP,</b> radio channels and its frequencies. These are leveraged collectively or independently to offer services. Na√Øvely, network service providers can provision a fixed amount of resources that satisfies an expected demand for a service. However, it is non-trivial to predict demand, while over and under estimation can lead to both poor utilization and loss in revenue. Therefore, a fundamental challenge in resource management is predicting demand and dynamically provisioning and reprovisioning resources, such that the network is resilient to variations in service demand. Despite the widespread application of ML for load prediction and resource {{management in}} cloud data centers [367], various challenges still prevail for different networks, including cellular networks, wireless networks and ad hoc networks. Though, there are various challenges in resource management, in this survey, we consider two broad categories, admission control and resource allocation.|$|R
