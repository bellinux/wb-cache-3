50|$|Following {{two years}} of {{production}} improvements were introduced in September 1927 for that year's motor show. The wheelbase was lengthened by 2 in but not the car's overall length. The steering was improved for a smoother and lighter action and the column rake was now adjustable. The front brake cables were replaced with rods. The engine received larger crankshaft and connecting rod bearings and an anti-detonating ("anti-knock") design adopted for the cylinder head. A Weymann fabric bodied 4-light 4-door sports saloon (as chosen for personal use by Henry Segrave) with safety glass option and a 6-light Safety saloon (fitted with Triplex safety glass) joined the range. The artillery wheel option was dropped. Dipping headlights were a new feature. Separate seats replaced the front bench seat and both back and front seats were widened. There were also changes to the mudguards and running boards. The export car was widened to 67 in inches and its track to 56 in inches. A water-impeller and a large top <b>radiator</b> <b>tank</b> were also fitted to export cars.|$|E

50|$|This {{modification}} was successful, but it {{was noted}} that the engine hoods were a potential constraint. All further DSC class locomotives equipped with the refuges had their engine hoods shortened by 500mm, necessitating the relocation of the <b>radiator</b> header <b>tanks</b> to their present 'east-west' alignment.|$|R
50|$|The 105 series Giulia {{was quite}} an {{advanced}} car, using such technologies as all-wheel disc brakes, and a plastic <b>radiator</b> header <b>tank.</b> It had also the lowest drag coefficient (Cd) in its class The same trend continued with the Alfetta 2000 and GTV, which had such things as 50:50 weight distribution, standard fit alloy wheels and transaxle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{use of a}} spare car was restricted. Each {{competing}} {{team would}} not be allowed to have more than two cars available for use at any time. In this context, a car was considered as such if it was a partially assembled survival cell, fitted with an engine, any front suspension, bodywork, <b>radiators,</b> oil <b>tanks</b> or heat exchangers.|$|R
50|$|The {{mid-engined}} configuration, {{which the}} Cooper Car Company eventually revived, was unusual at the time. From {{front to rear}} the layout comprised <b>radiator,</b> driver, fuel <b>tank,</b> and engine.|$|R
50|$|Ashley were {{manufacturer}} of body shells and chassis for specials from 1955 to 1962. They also offered {{a range of}} products for special builders: <b>radiators,</b> header <b>tanks,</b> lighting sets, steel tubing, sheet aluminium, various suspension parts, water pumps, tires, tubes and wheels. The company also made bonnets and hardtops for other mass-produced sports cars, including the Austin-Healey Sprite and Jaguar E-Type.|$|R
25|$|Today, steam, evaporator, and {{condenser}} coils {{are made}} from copper and copper alloys. These heat exchangers are used in air conditioning and refrigeration systems, industrial and central heating and cooling systems, <b>radiators,</b> hot water <b>tanks,</b> and under-floor heating systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{process was}} spread {{out from the}} late 1970s into the early 1980s. As part of this, some {{locomotives}} were repainted in the International Orange livery but with their pre-TMS numbers instead of the later TMS numbers. As a result of this, the locomotives were equipped with new <b>radiator</b> header <b>tanks</b> which were mounted behind the radiator {{on top of the}} engine hoods in a 'north-south' alignment. Later the tanks were relocated to an 'east-west' alignment.|$|R
5000|$|The 1905 model had 24-horsepower and was {{priced at}} US$2,500. It was advertised as [...] "light, strong and speedy" [...] and had 4 {{vertical}} cylinders and sliding gear transmission with 3 speeds forward and reverse. It {{also had a}} bevel gear drive, side entrance, removable tonneau and was air-cooled via a rotary supercharger which forced air through aluminum jackets surrounding the cylinders. This [...] "single handedly" [...] solved the air cooling automobile problem and the vehicle had no water pump, <b>radiator,</b> water <b>tank</b> or piping.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} GL1000 (designated K0) had {{an electric}} starter {{backed up by}} a kick start lever stored inside a dummy fuel tank, which also housed the <b>radiator</b> expansion <b>tank,</b> electrical components, {{as well as the}} air filter supplying four Keihin 32 mm CV carburetors. The real fuel tank was under the seat, {{in order to keep the}} center of mass as low as possible. The bike had a dry weight of 584 lb and a retail price of US $2,900. 13,000 Gold Wings were sold in the United States in 1975.|$|R
50|$|The {{frames of}} the {{locomotives}} are welded from 20 mm thick steel plates {{with a cover}} plate that was cut out for engine and gearbox. The ends of the frame are strengthened to carry standard buffers and chain link couplers. The frame rests on adjustable leaf springs, the axles have slide bearings. Engine, <b>radiator,</b> fuel <b>tank,</b> sandboxes and silencer are mounted under the hood, air tanks beneath the running boards. The batteries are mounted behind the front steps. Starting with class 102.0 the locomotives were also fitted with an oil-fired engine pre-heater under the cab.|$|R
50|$|Systems: Systems are the {{collection}} of components that go together to make an element or {{to carry out a}} function.

25|$|Corrosion {{resistance}} {{is essential in}} heat transfer applications where fluids are involved, such as in hot water <b>tanks,</b> <b>radiators,</b> etc. The only affordable material that has similar corrosion resistance to copper is stainless steel. However, the thermal conductivity of stainless steel is 1/30th that of copper. Aluminium tubes are not suitable for potable or untreated water applications because it corrodes at pH<7.0 and releases hydrogen gas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were prepared}} {{with a number}} of modifications from standard specification. Hulls and wingtip floats were finished with white enamel and larger engine <b>radiators,</b> oil <b>tanks</b> and top-plane fuel tanks were fitted. In addition, there were internal changes to provide more space and support facilities for the crew, who had to live on board for periods during the trip. Metal, instead of wooden, airscrews were fitted to the aircraft during the flight. [...] Specially designed collapsible rubber dinghies were also carried. No automatic pilots or blind flying aids were fitted, and only two of the four aircraft had radio sets - communication between aircraft in the air being by lamp or hand-signals.|$|R
50|$|The {{front engine}} mounts on the K75 frame are placed further back {{than in the}} K100 frame and the downtubes are at a {{different}} angle; otherwise the frames are identical. The K75 had the same wheelbase, seat height, and steering geometry as the K100. According to BMW, 80 percent of the K75's parts are interchangeable with the K100's. The K75's <b>radiator</b> and fuel <b>tank</b> were smaller than those on the K100.|$|R
25|$|The Il-2 is a single-engine, propeller-driven, low-wing {{monoplane}} {{of mixed}} construction {{with a crew}} of two (one in early versions), specially designed for assault operations. Its most notable feature was the inclusion of armor in an airframe load-bearing scheme. Armor plates replaced the frame and paneling throughout the nacelle and middle part of the fuselage, and an armored hull made of riveted homogeneous armor steel AB-1 (AB-2) secured the aircraft’s engine, cockpit, water and oil <b>radiators,</b> and fuel <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Roock Racing's Porsches {{differed}} {{greatly from}} factory GT2s {{in order to}} keep their cars competitive. The cars were developed in-house by Mike Gramke. By 1998, Roock's 911 GT2 sported a 600 HP 3.8 engine, sequential Gemini gearbox, Thielert engine management, repositioned <b>radiators</b> and fuel <b>tank,</b> tracks increased by 7 cm, a lightened and reinforced Matter tub and revised air circulation with specific floors.

50|$|The Tiger {{tank was}} too heavy for small bridges, so it was {{designed}} to ford four-metres deep in water. This required unusual mechanisms for ventilation and cooling when underwater. At least 30 minutes of set-up time was required, with the turret and gun being locked in the forward position, and a large snorkel tube raised at the rear. An inflatable doughnut-shaped ring sealed the turret ring. The two rear compartments (each containing a fuel <b>tank,</b> <b>radiator</b> and fans) were floodable. Only the first 495 units were fitted with this deep fording system; all later models were capable of fording only two metres.|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of {{latent heat storage}} solutions into modern domestic heating systems {{has the potential to}} enhance the overall system performance compared to standard hot-water systems (<b>radiators</b> and <b>tanks)</b> due to augmentation of the stored heat by the latent heat of a suitable material. This paper presents computational prediction and experimental validation of the dynamic behaviour and performance of an active thermal storage system for domestic applications, based on the use of a hydrated salt PCM. The thermal extraction and heating rates for the PCM tank are compared to a water filled tank. Flow and temperature fields are analysed in a customised storage tank design for heat transfer and performance characterisation. Experimental findings show excellent agreement with the 3 D CFD simulation results. The heat removal performance has been identified as being the limiting factor when compared to a water-based system. It is also confirmed that the PCM solution has the capability to store a large amount of heat effectively but design improvements are required to eliminate the cooling limited heat transfer process in the current apparatus...|$|R

25|$|The TM-22, {{which was}} based on Thomas's {{unsuccessful}} MB-9 fighter and MB-10 training aircraft, which had both flown in 1921 but had been quickly abandoned. It was of all-metal construction, with corrugated duralumin skinning over a duralumin structure, while its wing featured a distinct hump in the centre above the fuselage. The two prototypes had different wings, with the first prototype having a span of 29ft 0in (8.84m) and a wing area of 174sq ft (16.2m²), while the second had a span of 25ft (7.62m) and an area of 150sq dt (13.9m²).

Using the UK as an example, as electricity industry privatisation took place in the 1980s and 1990s the new electricity companies were made aware of their environmental responsibilities. Most area and national companies realised that they had several thousand transformers, many of which had been leaking into the ground below them for many years. The companies embarked on an upgrading programme involving the construction of [...] "water-tight" [...] bunds to retain any oil leakage and to prevent further pollution and contamination.|$|R

50|$|The energy survey {{needed to}} produce an EPC is {{performed}} by an assessor who visits the property, examines key items such as loft insulation, domestic boiler, hot water <b>tank,</b> <b>radiators,</b> windows for double glazing, and so on. He or she then inputs the observations into a software program which performs the calculation of energy efficiency. The program gives a single number for the rating of energy efficiency, and a recommended value {{of the potential for}} improvement. There are similar figures for environmental impact. A table of estimated energy bills per annum (and the potential for improvement) is also presented, but without any reference to householder bills. The householder will {{have to pay for the}} survey, which costs around £60 for a four bedroom house. The exercise is entirely non-invasive, so the software will make assumptions on the insulation properties of various elements of the property based on age and construction type.

40|$|This {{project was}} funded through a Pollution Prevention Grant from Minnesota Office of Waste Management. The shop survey, {{conducted}} {{as part of}} this project, indicated a number of industry trends and concerns. Through our work in this project, there is an apparent growth in concern and industry efforts to try to comply with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards. Numerous shops continue to inquire about the project's progress and any new developments in a recycling program with Gopher Smelting and Refining Company. Many shops are now properly storing their sludge in hope of a workable disJX>sal/recycling program. When reviewing the results of the chemical analysis of radiator boil-out/ultrasonic sludge, the range of lead in the radiator sludge runs from near 0 to about 20 % on a dry basis. In discussions with shop owners, most commented that they would add their solder droppings to their sludge to raise lead levels, increasing Gopher Smelting and Refining Company's interest in developing a recycling program. Although there is an apparent increasing trend in not using a boil-out or ultrasonic cleaner, owners stated their main reason for shutting off the cleaning devices was concern about sludge disJX>sal. With some type of recycling program, it can be concluded that these shops will be using their machines again. · There is a very strong interest in participating in some type of sludge disposal/recycling program. Two issues need to be addressed before any recycling program can work: 1) the program must be user friendly [...] it must not be difficult to work with; and 2) it must be cost effective for a shop owner to participate. Over the past year, interest in waste reduction/recycling and compliance with the law has increased. If some type of program can be developed and continued, the state will see a definite surge in shop participation, which of course will result in less waste being dumped illegally. In addition to the mail and interview survey, {{there were a number of}} bench-scale studies on various parts of the radiator preparation process and a full-scale factory experiment to smelt and convert a 1, 000 lb. lot of <b>radiator</b> boil-out <b>tank</b> sludge to bullion lead. Most of the benchscale experimentation did not seem adequately effective for adoption by the industry. However, the mist water wash down may be adapted to help minimize drag-out of caustic boil-out solution. There should be an additional benefit to maintain the caustic boil-out tank solution and minimize dilution of boil-out bath. The full-scale factory experiment to smelt down a 1, 000 lb. lot of radiator boil-out sludge went well. The shipment was made by a hazardous material truck and received at the smelter. The material was processed through Gopher Smelting and Refining Company without disrupting operations, and the product lead did not vary from the nonnal analysis range. Based on favorable results of the surveys, sample analyses, and full-scale factory test, the smelter is proceeding with an internal, proprietary detennination of a fee schedule to process the boil-out sludge at various levels of lead content.
