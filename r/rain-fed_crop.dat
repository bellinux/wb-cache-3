40|$|Owing to its severe {{effect on}} {{productivity}} of <b>rain-fed</b> <b>crops</b> and indirect effect on employment {{as well as}} per capita income, agricultural drought has become a prime concern worldwide. The occurrence of drought is mainly a climatic phenomenon which cannot be eliminated. However, its effects can be reduced if actual spatio-temporal information related to crop status is available to the decision makers. The present study attempts to assess the efficiency of remote sensing and GIS techniques for monitoring the spatio-temporal extent of agricultural drought. In the present study, NOAA-AVHRR NDVI data were used for monitoring agricultural drought through NDVI based Vegetation Condition Index. VCI was calculated for whole Rajasthan using the long term NDVI images which reveals the occurrence of drought related crop stress during the year 2002. The VCI values of normal (2003) and drought (2002) year were compared with meteorological based Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Rainfall Anomaly Index and Yield Anomaly Index and a good agreement was found among them.

The study was carried out during the kharif season using remote sensing, meteorology and soil information from year 1998 to 2004.

In addition, a negative rainfall shock in the third year of life affects adversely both schooling and height. The effects differ by region in ways that reflect differing constraints on families that are shaped by regional economic heterogeneity. We predict that policies that help rural families smooth income shocks will result in increases in human capital and in substantial cumulative returns in productivity over the life course.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} role that water demand {{management}} (WDM) in agriculture can play in {{the transition to the}} Green Economy in the arid and semi-arid Mediter- ranean region. In particular, it will investigate the potential for WDM strategies to {{contribute to the development of}} green economies, through the adoption of demand-regulating market mechanisms and improvements in water use efficien- cy. The study argues that, first, for the aim of achieving optimal solutions, it is paramount to ensure the alignment between individual and collective interests by means of the enhanced capacity of markets to convey signals of the relative scarcity of different resources. The extent to which water price/cost reflects relative water scarcity has a great potential to influence actual performances in agriculture and to discourage unsustainable water use. Second, the study suggests that, while there is large scope for improving overall water use efficiency in both irrigated and rain- fed agriculture, the greatest potential lies in upgrading <b>rain-fed</b> <b>crop</b> production, which supports the largest share of food production globally.

40|$|Global warming has {{resulted}} in increasingly frequent and severe drought and/or precipitation events. Severe drought limits crop water availability and impacts agricultural productivity and socioeconomic development. To quantify drought-induced yield loss during the main crop stages in Liaoning province, China, aspects of drought episodes (magnitude, duration, and frequency) were investigated during the period 1960 – 2015 using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), respectively. Then {{the relationship between the}} SPI/SPEI and the standardized yield residuals series (SYRS), and the drought-induced yield loss were analyzed for maize, rice, sorghum, soybean, and millet. Liaoning underwent a province-wide increase in temperature, reduced precipitation, and reduced reference crop evapotranspiration. As expected, Liaoning experienced province-wide meteorological drying trends during the main crop growth stages, while the drought frequency, duration, and magnitude were not as serious as revealed by using the SPI. As compared to the SPI, the SPEI considering potential evapotranspiration explained 39 %– 78 % yield variability of SYRS and evaluated the drought-induced yield loss more accurately. The increased drought frequency mainly affected the <b>rain-fed</b> <b>crops</b> (maize, sorghum, soybean, and millet), while it did not reduce irrigated rice production. No major impact was exerted on the <b>rain-fed</b> <b>crops</b> caused by mild drought.
