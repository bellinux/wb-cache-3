40|$|Review {{of some of}} the {{procedures}} and results of the double monochromator and colinear photometer Nimbus- 4 satellite experiment that measures ultraviolet terrestrial radiance, Lambert reflectivity of the lower boundary of the scattering atmosphere, and extraterrestrial solar irradiance. The experiment has produced nearly three years of almost continuous data which are being used to infer the high-level ozone distribution and total ozone on a global basis. The high-level ozone data have been verified by independent coincident <b>rocket</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>soundings,</b> and the total ozone values show good agreement with Dobson spectrophotometer determinations. An increase has been observed in equatorial radiance at 2550 A relative to 2900 A, which seems to indicate that the amount of ozone in the upper stratosphere is related to the eleven-year solar cycle...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rocket</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>soundings</b> {{have been}} {{conducted}} in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere at high latitudes during winter. The collection of soundings show {{a high degree of}} variability when compared to ozone distributions measured during summer and at lower latitudes. The concurrently observed temperature and winds also show large variations which can be qualitatively related to the ozone profiles. Two most unusual ozone profiles were observed in January 1979 over Alaska during a stratospheric warming event. Both ozone profiles were consistent in showing the measured mixing ratios to be higher at 50 km than those measured at 40 km, a feature never reported before. This feature is related to the concurrently observed wind and temperature distributions and the NMC analyses of pressure height fields. The polar night ozone observations in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere suggest some temperature dependence, but transports seem to play an important role...|$|R

Evidence is obtained that the NOx budget is not simply explained by oxidation of biospheric nitrous oxide. I 1 -D time-dependent photochemical model is used to compute the amount of NO 2 required to maintain odd oxygen in a steady state after accounting for Chapman, odd hydrogen, and odd chlorine reactions. At Wallops Island, a mid-latitude station, the inferred seasonal variation of NOx is small with {{the fall and winter}} mixing ratios about 20 percent greater than the spring and summer values. The soundings at Fort Churchill require about the same NOx amount as at Wallops Island {{in the spring and summer}} months but more than twice this amount in late fall and winter. Results indicate that the nitrous oxide source of NOx is supplemented by a polar source during the fall and winter months. This is consistent with the descent of thermospheric air with its high nitric oxide content during the period of strong cooling in the polar night...|$|R

40|$|A {{validation}} of the GOME- 2 ozone profiles has been carried out. This {{has been done by}} using <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> data, which have a vertical resolution of about 100 m and is measuring ozone from the surface up to about 34 km. GOME- 2 ozone data was made available by KNMI at pre-selected sites. The reference data which was available limited this study to the European mid-latitudes and European Nordic region. The algorithm version used for this retrieval of GOME- 2 ozone profiles is 3. 2. For this study, data from other <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> stations besides Uccle have been used (De Bilt, Hohenpeissenberg, Payerne, NY-Alesund, Sodankyla and Lerwick). GOME- 2 ozone profiles show sensibly better results at European mid-latitudes than at Nordic latitudes, especially in the tropopause region. The target accuracies for the ozone profiles are respectively 30 % in the troposphere and 15 % in the stratosphere. Data analysis over the time period March 2007 - February 2008 has shown that this accuracy is reached at least partially in the stratosphere. In the UTLS region, and especially at high latitudes, GOME- 2 ozone profiles are least accurate.

40|$|Regular balloon <b>ozone</b> <b>soundings</b> with {{electrochemical}} sondes {{have been}} performed at Uccle since 1969. More than 450 <b>ozone</b> <b>soundings</b> between 1985 and 1989 were {{used to calculate the}} altitudes Zs from the VIZ radiosonde data and the altitudes Zr deduced from the tracking of the balloon train with a primary wind-finding radar. The values of Zs at fixed times appeared to be systematically too low as compared to Zr. The differences Zr-Zs increase with altitude; at 30 km the annual mean values of Zr-Zs (plus or minus standard deviation) vary between 590 plus or minus 910 m and 1410 plus or minus 1160 m, according to the pressure calibration of different manufacturing series of radiosondes. From these results it is found that around the 30 km level the ozone concentrations calculated from soundings with VIZ sondes are too low by 7. 5 to 14 percent, depending upon the manufacturing series of radiosondes. At least part of the discrepancy which has often been found between ozone profiles from balloon soundings and from other techniques such as rocket observations or Umkehr measurements may be explained by this effect. An altitude correction would have important consequences as to the climatology of ozone in the middle stratosphere as adopted at the moment. About half of the day-to-day variability of <b>ozone</b> observed from <b>soundings</b> with VIZ radiosondes above the 30 km level, is induced by the variability of Zr-Zs.

40|$|A global {{three-dimensional}} (i. e. latitude, longitude, altitude) climatology of {{tropospheric ozone}} {{is derived from}} the <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> record by trajectory mapping. Approximately 52 000 ozonesonde profiles from more than 100 stations worldwide since 1962 are used. The small number of stations causes the set of <b>ozone</b> <b>soundings</b> to be sparse in geographical spacing. Here, forward and backward trajectory calculations are performed for each <b>sounding</b> to map <b>ozone</b> measurements to a number of other locations, and so to fill in the spatial domain. This is possible because the lifetime of ozone in the troposphere is of the order of weeks. This physically-based interpolation method offers obvious advantages over typical statistical interpolation methods. The trajectory-mapped ozone values show reasonable agreement, where they overlap, to the actual soundings, and the patterns produced separately by forward and backward trajectory calculations are similar. Major regional features of the tropospheric ozone distribution are clearly evident in the global maps. An interpolation algorithm based on spherical functions is further used for smoothing and to fill in remaining data gaps. The resulting three-dimensional global tropospheric ozone climatology facilitates visualization and comparison of different years, decades, and seasons, and offers some intriguing insights into the global variation of tropospheric ozone. It will be useful for climate and air quality model initialization and validation, and as an a priori climatology for satellite data retrievals. Further division of the climatology into decadal averages provides a global view of tropospheric ozone trends, which appear to be surprisingly modest over the last four decades...|$|R

40|$|This study explores a domain-filling {{trajectory}} {{approach to}} generate a global ozone climatology from relatively sparse ozonesonde data. Global <b>ozone</b> <b>soundings</b> comprising 51 898 profiles at 116 stations over 44 yr (1965 – 2008) are used, from which forward and backward trajectories are calculated from meteorological reanalysis data to map ozone measurements to other locations and so fill in the spatial domain. The resulting global ozone climatology is archived monthly for five decades from the 1960 s to the 2000 s on a grid of 5 ° × 5 ° × 1 km (latitude, longitude, and altitude), from the surface to 26 km altitude. It is also archived yearly for the same period. The climatology is validated at 20 selected ozonesonde stations by comparing the actual <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> profile with that derived through trajectory mapping of <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> data from all stations except the one being compared. The two sets of profiles are in good agreement, both overall with correlation coefficient r = 0. 991 and root mean square (RMS) of 224 ppbv and individually with r from 0. 975 to 0. 998 and RMS from 87 to 482 ppbv. The ozone climatology is also compared with two sets of satellite data from the Satellite Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) and the Optical Spectrography and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS). The ozone climatology compares well with SAGE and OSIRIS data in both seasonal and zonal means. The mean differences are generally quite small, with maximum differences of 20 % above 15 km. The agreement is better in the Northern Hemisphere, where there are more ozonesonde stations, than in the Southern Hemisphere; it is also better {{in the middle and}} high latitudes than in the tropics where reanalysis winds are less accurate. This ozone climatology captures known features in the stratosphere as well as seasonal and decadal variations of these features. The climatology clearly shows the depletion of ozone from the 1970 s to the mid 1990 s and ozone increases in the 2000 s in the lower stratosphere. When this climatology is used as the upper boundary condition in an Environment Canada operational chemical forecast model, the forecast is improved {{in the vicinity of the}} upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) region. This ozone climatology is latitudinally, longitudinally, and vertically resolved and it offers more complete high latitude coverage as well as a much longer record than current satellite data. As the climatology depends on neither a priori data nor photochemical modeling, it provides independent information and insight that can supplement satellite data and model simulations of stratospheric ozone...|$|R

This is currently {{one of only three}} <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> stations in the northern hemisphere (NH) tropics, and {{the only one in the}} equatorial Atlantic region. Paramaribo is part of the Southern Hemisphere ADditional Ozone Sounding program (SHADOZ). Due to its position close to the equator, the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) passes over Paramaribo twice per year, which results in a semi-annual seasonality of many parameters including relative humidity and ozone. The dataset from Paramaribo is used to: (1) evaluate ozone variability relative to precipitation, atmospheric circulation patterns and biomass burning; (2) contrast ozone at the NH equatorial Atlantic with that at nearby southern hemisphere (SH) stations Natal (6 deg S, 35 deg W) and Ascension (8 deg S, 14 deg W); (3) compare the seasonality of tropospheric ozone with a satellite-derived ozone product: Tropical Tropospheric Ozone Columns from the Modified Residual method (MR-TTOC). We find that Paramaribo is a distinctly Atlantic station. Despite its position north of the equator, it resembles nearby SH stations during most of the year. Transport patterns in the lower and middle troposphere during February and March differ from SH stations, which leads to a seasonality of ozone with two maxima. MR-TTOC over Paramaribo does not match the observed seasonality of ozone due to the use of a SH ozone sonde climatology in the MR method. The Paramaribo ozone record is used to suggest an improvement for northern hemisphere MR-TTOC retrievals.
