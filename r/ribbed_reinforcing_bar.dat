40|$|The thesis {{researches}} {{the impact}} of cement types on the bond between concrete and reinforcing steel. The experimental part of the thesis includes laboratory research. Within the lab research we prepared concrete mixtures for which we used three different types of cement. From each type of concrete we created three test pieces. All the other components of concrete were the same and added in the same proportion. We have produced specimens {{in the form of}} cubes with a side of 20 cm. The cube was inserted with a <b>ribbed</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> with a diameter of 20 mm which was piercing the center of the cube. The pull- out test was conducted in accordance with standard SIST EN 10080 : 2005. We burdened the reinforcing bar with tensile until the contact between concrete and the reinforcing steel was broken. Used types of cement differed in the amount of cement clinker and additives in the cement. Based on the research results we found that concretes using cement with a higher proportion of cement clinker achieve higher bond stresses between concrete and reinforcing steel. Increasing bond stresses are almost proportional to the increase of the cement clinker in cement...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects in R/C structures is bond between steel and concrete. It allows the formation of the resistant mechanisms that characterizes the structural behavior of a reinforced concrete element. In the recent years, code specifications reduced the lower limits for the relative rib area (bond index). The previous values were based on a wide experimental campaign. In general the latter should guarantee a good level of bond in all the common situations. Moreover building industry increased the use of rebar straightening by means of bending machines used to straighten and shape straightened rebar in coils for use on construction sites. The straightening produces a damage on the ribs that modifies their geometrical properties, essentially due to the action of the cold rolling line for coils in which the rollers induce a permanent deformation to the bar in order to obtain the final straightening. In the present work, the experimental results of pull-out tests, carried out according with the RILEM testing method, on <b>ribbed</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> produced in coils and subsequently mechanically straightened are shown.

40|$|Bond between {{steel and}} {{concrete}} is surely {{one of the}} most important aspects in reinforced concrete (r. c.) structures. The structural behavior in general and the formation of the resistant mechanisms in particular, for r. c. structures depends on bond. Normally bond performance has always been related to the relative rib area; in the recent years, a continuous discussion on code specifications regarding the lowering of the limits for the relative rib area (bond index) is under way. The previous values were based on a wide experimental campaign. In general the latter should guarantee a good level of bond in all the common situations. Moreover building industry increased the use of rebar straightening by means of machines used to straighten and shape rebar in coils for use on construction sites.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{pull-out}} {{bond test}} with short bond length for {{estimation of the}} splitting tendency of different <b>rib</b> shapes for <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> is proposed and investigated. In the test the bond force component along the bar is separated from the radial one. The radial component is determined by measuring circumferential strain in a steel ring surrounding the concrete of the pull-out specimen. The force component, which is longitudinal to the bar, is obtained by supporting the pull-out specimen with a teflon covered circular support close to the bar. Bars with specially turned ribs are studied concerning rib height and rib distance. Swedish standard high bond bars are also studied. The splitting tendency is stated {{as a function of}} the slip of the free bar end and also of the related rib area of the bars...|$|R

40|$|Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) {{has been}} criticised {{for a long}} time for its high energy {{consumption}} during the production process that releases quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. For decades, researchers have been searching for substitutive binders for manufacturing concrete. Of all the proposed alternative binders, geopolymers stand out because of their total environmental friendliness, good mechanical capabilities and inexpensive processing costs. A geopolymer is an inorganic polymer with an internal chemical composition very similar to that of natural zeolite. A commonly used raw material for producing geopolymers is low-calcium (class F) fly ash, which is a major by-product of power generation industries. Class F fly ash-based geopolymers are usually synthesized by activating the fly ash with alkaline activators. The reaction happening in synthesis is geopolymerisation which transforms fly ash into cement-like binder material. Previous research on class F fly ash-based geopolymer concrete (GPC) has proved its great potential as an alternative to OPC concrete in terms of outstanding chemical and comparable engineering characteristics. However, the structural performance of the reinforced concrete (RC) components relies on there being a sufficient bond between the concrete and the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars.</b> Before being utilised in any concrete structures, GPC must demonstrate that it possesses adequate bond strength and predictable bond behaviour with commercial steel reinforcements. Although the importance of investigating the bond characteristics of GPC has been recently acknowledged, nevertheless the bond performance between the reinforcement sand GPC matrices has not been sufficiently studied. The definitions about the bond mechanism and bond-slip rules for GPC were still not clear, which was an inevitable obstacle to its application. As part of the research committed to investigate the suitability of GPC in RC structures, this study aims to not only qualitatively but also quantitatively define the bond behaviour of GPC and, determine whether it could qualify as an alternative to traditional concrete in RC structures. This study used experimental tests, statistical analyses and finite element (FE) modelling to investigate the bond behaviour of GPC. The experimental program included manufacturing and testing plain and <b>ribbed</b> <b>bar</b> <b>reinforced</b> GPC cylinders in direct pull-out tests and beams in beam pull-out tests. Meanwhile, corresponding tests were conducted on equivalent reinforced OPC concrete cylinders and beams, in order to be used as control groups in comparison of bond quality. The experimental data were planned and obtained so as to be suitable for statistical regression and hypothesis testing. The empirical equations obtained from regression well predicted the bond-slip behaviour of GPC and were used in FE modelling. In the bond tests, the types of reinforcements were 16 mm plain and ribbed bars. The samples used for direct pull-out tests were cylinders 100 mm in diameter, and for beam pull-out tests were beams 220 mm wide, 450 mm deep and 600 mm long. In addition, standard 100 mm × 200 mm cylinders were cast together with the bond test specimens for mechanical testing on characteristics related to bond, including compressive strength, indirect tensile strength and elastic modulus. The mechanical test results illustrated that GPC possessed comparable compressive and indirect tensile strength but significantly lower elastic modulus than OPC concrete. Data obtained from mechanical tests were used in regression. The statistical correlations among these three crucial mechanical characteristics of GPC were examined and described by statistical predictions. Equations for predicting GPC’s indirect tensile strength and elastic modulus from its compressive strength were presented. The bond tests results illustrated that the failure modes observed in both the reinforced GPC and OPC concrete specimens were similar. All the <b>ribbed</b> <b>bar</b> <b>reinforced</b> samples failed in splitting while all the plain <b>bar</b> <b>reinforced</b> ones failed in pull-out. However, statistical significant differences had been shown in the bond strength and the bond-slip curves between GPC and OPC concrete samples. Specifically, test results demonstrated that the plain <b>bar</b> <b>reinforced</b> GPC samples had considerably higher bond strengths than those of OPC concrete. This was attributed to the relatively homogenous steel-GPC interface observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was observed that, unlike OPC, no particularly weak layer existed in the contact area between the steel and geopolymer. Meanwhile, the <b>ribbed</b> <b>bar</b> <b>reinforced</b> GPC samples had significantly better energy absorption capabilities than the ribbed OPC concrete ones. This was also attributed to the homogeneity of steel-GPC interface, as well as the low elastic modulus of GPC. Strain gauges were installed along the bars to obtain changes in the steel strain during pull-out procedure. The distribution of bond stress within the bond length was calculated from the recorded values of steel strain. The bond stress distribution curves illustrated that the bond stress distributed non-uniformly along the bond length of plain and <b>ribbed</b> <b>bar</b> <b>reinforced</b> GPC, with the maximum stress occurring near the loaded-end. The uniform stress distribution assumption is not true for either OPC concrete or GPC. The bond-slip behaviour of GPC was successfully modelled using ANSYS with empirical equations and material properties obtained from the experiments. The modelling results successfully reflected the bond-slip and bond distribution curves obtained from experiments. With the bond-slip effects, the FE analysis on flexural behaviour of GPC beams obtained more realistic results than the perfect bonding model reported in the literature. To sum up, GPC possesses eligible engineering properties, remarkable bond strength and predictable bond-slip behaviour. Therefore, it could qualify as an appropriate replacement for OPC concrete in steel bar RC structures...|$|R

The adoption of a reasonable structure of the springing joint is of important significance in the design of an arch bridge. In this paper, with regard to the structure of Xinshiji Bridge, two types of arch springing were put forward. In Scheme- 1, the lower chords of steel truss arch ribs are connected to the concrete piers with shear studs on the ribs and cap plates welded on the ribs at the top of concrete piers., while Scheme- 2 is a integrated spring joint with a base plate {{on the bottom of the}} steel arch <b>ribs</b> and with <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> through the holes on the joints steel arch ribs. 3 D finite element models of the two types of springing joint were established and the relative slips between the concrete and steel were taken into account in the analyses.

40|$|The {{development}} of an accurate local bond stress–slip (τ–δ) relationship for steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> has been hindered for two reasons: because steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> are internally encased, {{it is difficult to}} strain gauge the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> to quantify the change in strain over a given length and, therefore, to directly measure the local τ–δ relationship; and {{because of the presence of}} yielding, which generally occurs before debonding and significantly influences the behaviour of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar.</b> To overcome these difficulties associated with quantifying the local τ–δ relationship of steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars,</b> theory developed to obtain the local τ–δ relationship from the global load slip (P–Δ) response of FRP plated reinforced concrete structures has been modified in this research to account for short embedment lengths.
