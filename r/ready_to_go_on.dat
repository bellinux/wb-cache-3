5|$|Mortar and {{artillery}} exchange between the South Ossetian and Georgian forces {{erupted in the}} afternoon of 6 August along almost the entire line of contact, which lasted until the dawn of 7 August. Exchanges resumed following a brief gap in the morning. South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity announced that {{the armed forces of}} South Ossetia were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the offensive in the next few hours. At 14:00 on 7 August, two Georgian peacekeepers were killed in Avnevi as a result of Ossetian shelling. At about 14:30, Georgian tanks, 122mm howitzers and 203mm self-propelled artillery began heading towards South Ossetia to dissuade separatists from additional attacks. During the afternoon, OSCE monitors recorded Georgian military traffic, including artillery, on roads near Gori. In the afternoon, Georgian personnel left the Joint Peacekeeping Force headquarters in Tskhinvali.|$|E
25|$|The Lilac Time {{have gone}} through various line-up changes with the Duffy {{brothers}} as mainstays. The group originally consisted of Stephen Duffy, his elder brother Nick Duffy, and friend Michael Weston, who recorded the first album together; Michael Giri and Fraser Kent joined when the band was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> tour. The Lilac Time put out the albums Paradise Circus in 1989 and & Love For All in 1990 for Fontana before being dropped.|$|E
500|$|The actual {{date was}} chosen by General Kenney based {{on the advice of}} his two weather-forecasting teams, one Australian and one American. Ideally, Z-Day would be clear from Port Moresby to Nadzab but foggy over New Britain, thereby {{preventing}} the Japanese air forces at Rabaul from intervening. Forecasting the weather days in advance with such precision was difficult enough in peacetime, but more so in wartime, when many of the areas from which the weather patterns developed were occupied by the enemy and data from them was consequently denied to the forecasters. When the two teams differed over the best possible date, Kenney [...] "split {{the difference between the two}} forecasts and told General MacArthur we would be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the morning of the 4th for the amphibious movement of the 9th Division to Hopoi Beach and about nine o’clock on the morning of the 5th we would be ready to fly the 503rd Parachute Regiment to Nadzab." ...|$|E

500|$|Wilkinson, by then Leeds United manager, {{returned}} to his former club in July 1991 to sign two young centre-backs, Jon Newsome first and Wetherall a few days later, for a combined fee of £275,000. The 20-year-old Wetherall's first season at Leeds was {{the final year of}} his degree course, so he played for the reserves while training part-time. He made a brief debut in the First Division, on 3 September 1991 at Elland Road as a late substitute against Arsenal; Leeds {{went on to win the}} 1991–92 league title. He remembers it as [...] "With 20 minutes to go, we were 2–1 down and I was on the touchline <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on,</b> then Lee Chapman scored and the gaffer (Howard Wilkinson) told me to sit down again. But he threw me on for the last two minutes. I always tell people that made the difference in winning the title!" [...] As his teammates took the league trophy on a celebratory open top bus tour, Wetherall chose to revise for his examinations, a decision he came to regret, because [...] "those experiences don't come around that often". Though the revision bore fruit: he graduated with first-class honours.|$|E
500|$|In Willow's dream {{she struggles}} {{to find her}} place in the school theater {{production}} of Death of a Salesman, while her friends and classmates are apparently fully costumed, prepared, and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> stage. Her confusion represents her lack of self-confidence, her fear that she still does not fit in or have a place in the world, unlike those around her, who are competent and know what is going on. She wears ordinary clothes, but the others repeatedly comment on the excellence of her [...] "costume", a reference to her fear that her friends do not see what she has grown into, but rather what she was when younger: nerdy and awkward. This fear is confirmed when Buffy strips off her shirt and jeans, revealing the same unfashionable turtleneck and corduroy jumper she wore in episode one of the series, four years earlier, before her demon-fighting experiences and study of magic increased her confidence and competence. Willow stands anxiously {{at the front of the}} class, trying to read a paper, while her classmates express their boredom with listening to her and Oz whispers into Tara's ear, until she is attacked by the First Slayer and her breath is sucked out of her body.|$|E
500|$|Scenes are {{intercut with}} Rihanna heading to her show within a metro, {{together}} with her audience. As she gets into the arena, scenes are intercut and show the singer and her crew how they are preparing {{for the start of}} the show and shouting the name of the cities in which they performed. The scenes are intercut with Rihanna talking about her love towards Miami, and how she moved first in the city when she got signed to the label. Scenes of her and friends taking shots and having fun are further shown. Then, Rihanna explains how the second section of the Loud Tour is called [...] "Le Sex Shoppe"; the director of the tour Jamie King was inspired for creating the section, after he saw online the pictures of the singer visiting a sex shop in Australia. A scene of an early rehearsal for the tour is also shown, before seeing Rihanna performing [...] "S" [...] live on the concert. After the song, she performs [...] "Skin"; during the performance the singer takes two girls from the audience and performs lap dance as the set finishes with Nuno Bettencourt having a guitar solo. The scenes are intercut with Rihanna getting ready for the shoot of her We Found Love music video. Several scenes of the singer several scenes of Rihanna including getting off plane, choosing clothes, getting ready for a shoot and greeting her fans are shown.

Rihanna is shown at an Armani design meeting in London. She is talking about the commercial which they are preparing to shoot for the design company. Black-and-white scenes of Rihanna getting <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> stage again are shown before she starts performing [...] "Raining Men". The performance of the song features her performing the song on a top of a pink tank. Then, she gets off the tank and performs [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Breakin' Dishes".|$|E

During the day around 1000 warriors set off for the Pawnee to make a joint, quick attack and prevent the enemy from striking first.|$|E

2500|$|In mid-2004, Singer was in {{negotiations}} to direct [...] for Fox. Fox and Singer {{could not come}} to agreement and, after an extended détente, Singer was offered the chance to direct the new Superman film, which was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>On</b> July 19, 2004, Variety reported that Singer had signed on to direct Superman Returns for Warner Bros. In retaliation, Fox terminated their production deal with Bad Hat Harry Productions, Singer's production company. Superman Returns was filmed in Australia in 2005, and was released on June 28, 2006. Singer claims that though he had not read the comics, he had always admired and identified with the character, citing {{the fact that he}} and Superman are both orphans. He instead based Returns on his love of the 1978 film made by Richard Donner.|$|E

50|$|In August 2011, Bøge {{suffered}} a groin injury {{and was out}} for three months. He was back in October, but got injured again in January 2012. Bøge didn't play a single game in this season, and revealed after the season, that he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out <b>on</b> a loan. He was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> leave FCM because he wanted more playing time than being the third choice in the club.|$|R
2500|$|F. L. ("Peter") Lucas {{grew up in}} Blackheath and {{was educated}} at Colfe's, where his father F. W. Lucas (1860–1931) was headmaster, and from 1910 at Rugby, where he was tutored by the Sophocles scholar Robert Whitelaw (1843–1917) in his last year before retirement. He won a {{scholarship}} to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1913 to read for the Classical Tripos, adding the Pitt Scholarship and the Porson Prize in 1914. In January 1914 he was elected Apostle – the last Apostle elected before the War – coming {{under the influence of}} G. E. Moore. Believing Cambridge threatened with the fate of Louvain, he volunteered, aged 19, in October 1914 and was commissioned in November, serving from 1915 as second lieutenant in the 7th Battalion The Royal West Kent Regiment in France. From August 1915 he was in the Somme trenches opposite Fricourt and Mametz; he was wounded by shrapnel in May 1916. He returned to the front as lieutenant in January 1917, went into battle near Grandcourt on 17 February in the Ancre Offensive, was mentioned in despatches on 22 February, and was gassed on 4 March. In all he spent seventeen months in war-hospitals. By September 1917 he felt that the cause of honour and justice had been lost in the lust of Victory [...] ("We were too <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> fighting without offering terms" [...] ). Passed fit for garrison duty at Chatham, he sought the help of fellow-Apostle John Maynard Keynes to return to France, and from August 1918 to the Armistice he was Staff lieutenant in the Intelligence Corps (Third Army HQ), examining German prisoners near Bapaume and Le Quesnoy. His life hung in the balance in November 1918 shortly after the Armistice, when his lung wounds reopened in the influenza pandemic. He returned to Cambridge in January 1919. Fell-walking in the Lake District [...] "on Easter morning [...] on Kidsty Pike, between Hawes Water and Hayes Water, a blinding spring sun on snowy ridge beyond ridge, from Fairfield to Blucathra, brought a moment of such ecstatic intoxication that, were I a mystic, I should have called it a mystical experience." ...|$|E

His eponymous women’s label {{was picked up by}} Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and Barney’s among others. In April 2003, Robinson became the Creative Director of Perry Ellis Women’s Sportswear and then in 2005, was named Artistic Director for Paco Rabanne.|$|R
