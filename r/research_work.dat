5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} scientific research to emerge from Morgan's laboratory concerned the biochemistry of vitamins and the nutritional value of foods. She became best known for her work examining the effects of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) on adrenal gland function. In her early <b>research</b> <b>work,</b> Morgan analyzed processed foods and characterized their vitamin composition. She was the first to establish that a preservative, sulfur dioxide, protected vitamin C but damaged thiamine.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Mackinnon {{worked in}} {{military}} hospitals in Britain, researching {{and helping to}} diagnose amoebic dysentery. Her work in the military hospitals fuelled her interest in the topic, which she focussed on during the following years. In 1919, Mackinnon joined King's College, London as a lecturer and became Chair of Zoology in 1927, the first female Chair at the college. She remained in the role as Chair and professor for 22 years. Her <b>research</b> <b>work</b> focussed on parasitic protozoa, and she gave many lectures on the subject over the period of 30 years. She also gave broadcast lectures for schools.|$|E

Three classifications were produced that classify the <b>research</b> <b>works</b> into critical success factors, experiences and practices in a tailoring reference model and supporting tool. The issues discussed in this study are related to the framework and model, value-based tailored process, experienceware and quality of tailored process.

5|$|Morgan's {{department}} always faced financial {{struggles in}} an era before much federal research funding was available. To raise funds, Morgan provided food service educational courses to teachers, nurses and other participants. These classes ultimately weakened the department's reputation at the university, as school officials viewed the training as vocational and considered it to be beneath {{the standards of the}} university. Because of this, Morgan was prohibited from accepting industry funding for research and the university provided her with very little space to conduct her <b>research</b> <b>work.</b> Adding to the difficulty of the situation was the fact that university officials had previously criticized Morgan for maintaining academic standards that were too high for a home economics program.|$|E
5|$|<b>Research</b> <b>work</b> on the Book of the Dead {{has always}} posed {{technical}} difficulties {{thanks to the}} need to copy very long hieroglyphic texts. Initially, these were copied out by hand, with the assistance either of tracing paper or a camera lucida. In the mid-19th century, hieroglyphic fonts became available and made lithographic reproduction of manuscripts more feasible. In the present day, hieroglyphics can be rendered in desktop publishing software and this, combined with digital print technology, means that the costs of publishing a Book of the Dead may be considerably reduced. However, a very large amount of the source material in museums around the world remains unpublished.|$|E
5|$|The Dogon {{people are}} {{an ethnic group}} in Mali, West Africa, {{reported}} by some researchers to have traditional astronomical knowledge about Sirius that would normally be considered impossible {{without the use of}} telescopes. In 1938 Marcel Griaule produced his dissertation and received his doctorate degree from the École pratique des hautes études (EPHE) based on his <b>research</b> <b>work</b> with the Dogon. According to Griaule's books Conversations with Ogotemmêli 1965 and The Pale Fox 1972 they knew about the fifty-year orbital period of Sirius and its companion prior to western astronomers. They also refer to a third star accompanying Sirius A and B. Robert Temple's 1976 book The Sirius Mystery, credits them with knowledge of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn. This {{has been the subject of}} controversy and speculation.|$|E
