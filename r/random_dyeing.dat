40|$|We {{demonstrate}} improved {{characteristics in}} Rhodamine <b>dye</b> <b>random</b> lasers {{with the addition}} of gold nanoparticles. As a result of the strong plasmonic enhancement induced by gold nanoparticles, Rhodamine 640 /gold random lasers have less than half the lasing threshold compared with Rhodamine 640 /alumina random lasers in the weakly scattering regime for 10 ⁻³ M dye concentration. The optimum concentration of gold nanoparticles occurs at ∼ 8 × 10 ¹⁰ cm⁻³, close to the transition between the weakly scattering and diffusive regimes. Rhodamine 640 has a better performance compared with Rhodamine 6 G which is attributed to the greater spectral overlap of the Rhodamine 6 G fluorescence spectrum with the plasmon resonance of gold, leading to an increased energy transfer and fluorescence quenching for Rhodamine 6 G by gold. We also observe the contrasting trends of lasing threshold between <b>random</b> <b>dye</b> lasers incorporating dielectric and metal nanoparticles in the diffusive scattering regime. The effects of gold nanoparticles in <b>random</b> <b>dye</b> lasers are discussed {{in the context of the}} tradeoff between local field enhancement and fluorescence quenching. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} long-wavelength operation (> 700  nm) of <b>random</b> <b>dye</b> lasers (using a {{methylene blue}} dye) {{with the addition}} of rhodamine 6 G and titania, enabled by radiative and non-radiative energy transfer. The pump energy is efficiently absorbed and transferred to the acceptors, to support lasing in <b>random</b> <b>dye</b> lasers in the near infrared. The optimum random laser performance with the highest emission intensity and the lowest lasing threshold was achieved for a concentration of methylene blue as the acceptor equal to 6 × the concentration of rhodamine 6 G (donor). Excessive levels of methylene blue increased the lasing threshold and broadened the methylene blue emission linewidth due to dye quenching from re-absorption. This is due to competition between the donor emission and energy transfer and between absorption loss and fluorescence quenching. The radiative and non-radiative energy transfer is analyzed {{as a function of the}} acceptor concentration and pump energy density, with consideration of the spectral overlap. The dependence of the radiative and non-radiative transfer efficiency on the acceptor concentration is obtained, and the energy transfer parameters, including the radiative and non-radiative energy transfer rate constants (KR and KNR), are investigated using Stern–Volmer analysis. The analysis indicates that radiative energy transfer is the dominant energy transfer mechanism in this system. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A {{regularity}} of {{the predicted}} sensitivities to <b>random</b> and proportional <b>dye</b> concentration errors {{in regard to}} the position of target colour has been observed for the case of dyeing acrylic with basic dyes. The sensitivity of the recipe colour to <b>random</b> <b>dye</b> concentration errors is highest for light neutral target colours and is almost negligible for dark-shade recipes. Recipes for less saturated targets are slightly more sensitive than recipes for more saturated targets of equal lightness. The span of the sensitivities to weighing error of the recipes matching a given target varies with the position of the target in colour space. By contrast, the sensitivity of recipes to dye strength error is the highest at medium to low lightness for neutral and near neutral target shades. The span of sensitivities of the recipes for any such particular target is broad, with some having low sensitivity to strength errors. Recipes for the target colours at the "lighter" part of the gamut border were the least sensitive to strength errors...|$|R

40|$|The {{essential}} {{question of}} the paper "Can the predicted sensitivity to <b>random</b> and/or proportional <b>dye</b> concentration errors assist in selecting the most repeatable recipes?" was investigated using the laboratory dyeing of acrylic fabric with basic dyes. When the dye strength errors were not involved, the biggest scattering of the recipe colour in repeated dyeings was observed {{in the cases of}} light neutral target colours, where the predicted sensitivity to random concentration errors was the highest. For a few low-saturated targets, eight recipes with different predicted sensitivities to random errors were treated. In six cases out of the seven treated, those recipes less sensitive to random concentration errors generally performed better than the more sensitive ones, but the correlation was rather weak. For those cases whenthe dye strength errors were included, experiments were also carried out with several different recipes for a neutral medium-lightness target colour...|$|R
30|$|As NC isotherms {{followed}} the Langmuir model, dye species adsorbed on like sites of sorbent particles without interactions. Saturation happened as a monolayer of adsorbate formed. Likely {{because of the}} small thickness of the layer and the <b>random</b> distribution of <b>dye</b> species, the XRD pattern of the NC-Dye residue (Fig.  2) did not exhibit any peak associable to the dye, characterized by a well-crystallized structure (Fig.  2). However, {{in the case of the}} EMC-D residue, some X-reflections of the dye were identified (Fig.  2). In this respect, it could be mentioned that because of bands overlapping, the IR bands of the eventual tied species of the dye could not be distinguished (Fig.  3). It was believed that thicken layers of dye molecules were built around EMC particles. These results concurred with the isotherms modeling since it was shown that EMC isotherms {{followed the}} Freundlich equation, that is, adsorption happened on heterogeneous sites and dye layers built around solid particles. It seemed that, in the later case, active sites located on amorphous silica were involved in the adsorption process.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{model is}} {{presented}} as an aid in understanding, first, the relative noise performance and, second, the noise reduction achievable by referencing, in different experimental approaches to single shot broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS). Qualitative agreement is obtained with previous experimental investigations of CARS noise. The broadband dye laser radiation is described as the sum of independent modes with <b>random</b> phases. The <b>dye</b> laser contribution to the CARS noise is then approximately inversely proportional to the square root {{of the number of}} dye laser modes generating the detected signal. A fundamental idea is that in Raman resonant spectra only the number of Stokes modes actually participating in driving the Raman resonance should be counted. This means, e. g., that for narrow Raman resonances, as in an atmospheric flame, the noise generated by the dye laser will be higher for a single-mode pump laser than for a multimode pump laser with the experimental CARS configuration normally employed. The implications of the model for the dual broadband type CARS techniques are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{real-time}} PCR systems {{make it easy}} {{to monitor}} fluorescence while temperature is varied for hundreds of samples in parallel, permitting high-throughput studies. We employed such system to investigate melting transitions of ordered nucleic acid structures into disordered <b>random</b> coils. Fluorescent <b>dye</b> and quencher were attached to oligonucleotides {{in such a way that}} changes of fluorescence intensity with temperature indicated progression of denaturation. When fluorescence melting data were compared with traditional ultraviolet optical experiments, commonly used dye/quencher combinations, like fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine, showed substantial discrepancies. We have therefore screened 22 commercially available fluorophores and quenchers for their ability to reliably report annealing and melting transitions. Dependence of fluorescence on temperature and pH was also investigated. The optimal performance was observed using Texas Red or ROX dyes with Iowa Black RQ or Black Hole quenchers. These labels did not alter two-state nature of duplex melting process and provided accurate melting temperatures, free energies, enthalpies, and entropies. We also suggest a new strategy for determination of DNA duplex thermodynamics where concentration of a dye-labeled Re-use of this article is permitted in accordance with the Terms and Conditions set out a...|$|R

40|$|A full-genome {{microarray}} of the (oxy) photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 {{was used}} to identify genes that were transcriptionally regulated by growth in iron (Fe) -deficient versus Fe-sufficient media. Transcript accumulation for 3, 165 genes in the genome was analyzed using {{an analysis of variance}} model that accounted for slide and replicate (<b>random)</b> effects and <b>dye</b> (a fixed) effect in testing for differences in the four time periods. We determined that 85 genes showed statistically significant changes in the level of transcription (P ≤ 0. 05 / 3, 165 = 0. 0000158) across the four time points examined, whereas 781 genes were characterized as interesting (P ≤ 0. 05 but greater than 0. 0000158; 731 of these had a fold change > 1. 25 ×). The genes identified included those known previously to be Fe regulated, such as isiA that encodes a novel chlorophyll-binding protein responsible for the pigment characteristics of low-Fe (LoFe) cells. ATP synthetase and phycobilisome genes were down-regulated in LoFe, and there were interesting changes in the transcription of genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, in photosystem I and II assembly, and in energy metabolism. Hierarchical clustering demonstrated that photosynthesis genes, as a class, were repressed in LoFe and induced upon the re-addition of Fe. Specific regulatory genes were transcriptionally active in LoFe, including two genes that show homology to plant phytochromes (cph 1 and cph 2). These observations established the existence of a complex network of regulatory interactions and coordination in response to Fe availability...|$|R
50|$|These {{plate and}} film {{products}} differed substantially {{only in the}} means used to manufacture the colour mosaic layer and its resulting pattern and fineness. Autochrome's mosaic was a <b>random</b> array of <b>dyed</b> potato starch grains, {{too small to be}} individually visible without a microscope. Most competing products employed a coarser geometric pattern created by one of the many methods devised and patented during that era. Dufaycolor's filter layer was of the geometric type, but its proprietary manufacturing process produced an unusually fine-patterned mosaic. A very thin coating of collodion {{on one side of the}} film base was dyed blue, printed with closely spaced fine lines using a water-repelling greasy ink, and bleached. The clear spaces created were then dyed green. The ink was removed and new ink lines were printed at a 90 degree angle to the blue and green lines. The new gaps were bleached and dyed red, resulting in a colour filter mosaic, known as a réseau, consisting of alternating green and blue squares between red lines, and having roughly one million colour filter elements per square inch.In very early years, different arrangements of the same colours were used, the lines being green or blue instead of red and sometimes intersecting the other colours diagonally. After a final ink removal and the application of an isolating varnish, the same side of the film base was coated with a panchromatic black-and-white photographic emulsion. When exposed to light through the base and its réseau, the bit of emulsion behind each colour element recorded only the amount of light of that primary colour striking the film at that point.|$|R
30|$|Planning and {{inventory}} control {{is one of}} the major issues in industrial engineering; it is also one of the inevitable activities in each organization. Therefore, there exist several studies in this research area. Here, we investigate two general groups of papers. The first group considers inventory models with pricing. The integration of inventory and pricing policies leads to the joint optimization of the whole system and maximization of the total profit. Selling price consumer selection can gravitate to the customers. Lee (2011) considered two pricing policies based on two service levels. The author concluded that increasing the price leads some customers towards low service levels with lower prices. Whitin (1955) was the first researcher to formulate a newsboy model with price effect. In that model, the probability distribution of demand depended on the unit selling price where price was a decision variable. Abad (20032008), Dye (2007), and Dye and Hsieh (2010) assumed deteriorating items and allowable shortage. They presented models that considered the price as a decision variable. Abad (20032008) and Dye (2007) considered demand as a general function of price. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2004) and Esmaeili (2009) studied infinite planning horizon where shortage was not allowed. Mukhopadhyay considered demand to be a nonlinear function of price, while in the model of Esmaeili, demand was a general function. The annual profit of the manufacturer is maximized to determine the selling price, marketing expenditure, and lot size. Sana (2011) presented a stochastic inventory in which demand was considered to be dependent on the <b>random</b> selling price. <b>Dye</b> and Hsieh (2013) studied an advanced sales system with deteriorating items where prices were dependent on demand. They showed that advanced sales price is lower than the spot sales price. Sadjadi et al. (2012) used geometric programming (GP) to obtain optimal lot sizing, pricing, and marketing decisions such that the profit is maximized. However, using a single objective function is the major shortcoming of the models.|$|R
