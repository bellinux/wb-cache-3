40|$|International audienceThe ISO 26262 safety {{standard}} for <b>road</b> <b>vehicles,</b> among <b>other</b> engineer standards, {{was established to}} provide guidance {{for the development of}} safety-critical systems. Providing evidence of consistent, correct, and complete system specification covering different work-products is crucial in this context. One of these required work-products is the hardware-software interface (HSI) definition. The HSI definition is especially important since it defines the interfaces between different engineering domains (such as system development, HW development, and SW development). Model-based development (MBD) is the most promising approach to support consistent description of the system under development in a structured way. This paper thus presents an ISO 26262 aligned hardware-software interface definition tool approach which bidirectionally combines the versatility and in-tuitiveness of spreadsheet tools (such as Excel) and the properties of MDB tools (e. g. different views, levels of abstraction, central source of information, and information reuse). The approach presented is capable of defining an ISO 26262 compliant HSI and enables automatic derivation of basic software configurations according to these interface definitions.

40|$|A new {{lightweight}} smart wheel {{has been}} designed and manufactured. The smart wheel is able to measure the three forces and the three moments acting at the wheel. The wheel {{is based on an}} original structural concept and it appears to be rather simple to be implemented in future automobiles. The paper presents the concept and the testing of such a device. The structural part is composed basically by three spokes whose deformations (depending on the forces applied to the wheel) are sensed by means of strain gauges. The strain gauges signals are filtered, amplified and digitally converted and finally wireless transmitted to a remote receiver which can be connected to the vehicle control unit. A particular joint structure, which do realize the physical link between the three spoke structure (wheel hub) and the wheel rim, is designed. The smart-wheel calibration phase is described in the paper. A comprehensive indoor and outdoor experimental phase has been completed, useful to compare the performance of the new sensor with respect to commercial measuring wheels. The performance of the smart wheel fits well the need of improving the active safety of <b>road</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In <b>other</b> terms, the information given by the wheel, allowing to sense the three forces and the three moments, should lead to considerable improvement of the ABS and ESP/VDC performance with respect to today control logics...|$|R

This paper presents an evaluation of ride comfort of <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> running on a long span cable-stayed bridge under crosswind.
