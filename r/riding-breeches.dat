2500|$|In {{the spring}} {{the land in}} the Jordan Valley {{supports}} a little thin grass, but the fierce sun of early summer quickly scorches this leaving only a layer of white chalky marl impregnated with salt, several feet deep. This surface was soon broken up by the movement of mounted troops into a fine white powder resembling flour, and covering everything with a thick blanket of dust. Roads and tracks were often covered with as much as [...] of white powder and traffic stirred this up into a dense, limey cloud which penetrated everywhere, and stuck grittily to sweat-soaked clothes. A white coating of dust would enshroud men returning from watering their horses; their clothes, wet with perspiration which sometimes dripped from the knees of their <b>riding-breeches,</b> and their faces only revealed by sweaty rivulets.|$|E
60|$|The butler {{turned toward}} an elderly gentleman {{in a pink}} coat and <b>riding-breeches,</b> who had just descended into the hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should hope not--at dinner! The creepy jack-ass, I don't believe he's {{ever been}} on a horse in his life! He thinks <b>riding-breeches</b> are the----" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} more to be said. Lord Rufton sat moodily in the corner with his brows drawn down and his hands thrust deep {{into the pockets of}} his <b>riding-breeches.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Through all her tirade {{they had}} stood close together, her face visibly eager {{in the glow}} from the hotel; and Milt had grown taller. But he responded, [...] "I'm afraid I might {{have been just as}} bad. I haven't even reached the <b>riding-breeches</b> stage in evolution. Maybe never will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Study of our Special Correspondent {{repairing}} his wardrobe,' said Dick, gravely, as {{the other}} man kicked off a pair of sorely worn <b>riding-breeches</b> and began to fit a square of coarse canvas over the most obvious open space. He grunted disconsolately as {{the vastness of the}} void developed itself.|$|E
6000|$|This same meditative {{young man}} {{might have been}} {{discovered}} walking past {{the porch of the}} hotel, his hands in his pockets, his eyes presumably on the stars--certainly he gave no signs of watching Claire and the man in <b>riding-breeches</b> as they leaned over the rail, looked at mountain-tops filmy in starlight, while in the cologne-atomized mode, Breeches quoted: ...|$|E
60|$|She {{heard voices}} in the hall, and among them one with a very English accent--one that sounded {{precisely}} like those she had heard on the stage. It {{was the voice of}} a man, big, hearty, with that thick, throaty gurgle which is so suggestive of London that one is certain to find a tweed suit and <b>riding-breeches</b> associated with it.|$|E
6000|$|Milt sat {{farthest}} from the fire, by the dining-table. He was agonizing, [...] "This Jeff person {{is the real}} thing. He's no Percy in <b>riding-breeches.</b> He's used to society and nastiness. If {{he looks at me}} once more--young garage man found froze stiff, near Flathead Lake, scared look in eyes, believed to have met a grizzly, no signs of vi'lence. And I thought I could learn to mingle with Claire's own crowd! I wish I was out in the bug. I wonder if I can't escape?" ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{the terrace}} waited {{a woman of}} thirty-five, of clever face a bit worn at the edges, {{carefully}} coiffed hair, and careless white blouse with a tweed walking-skirt. She was gracefully holding out her hand, greeting Carl, [...] "It's terribly {{good of you to}} come clear out into our wilderness." [...] She was interrupted by the bouncing appearance of a stocky, handsome, red-faced, full-chinned, curly-black-haired man of forty, in <b>riding-breeches</b> and boots and a silk shirt; with him an excited small boy in rompers--Patton Kerr, Sr. and Jr.|$|E
60|$|His mate {{was a bit}} of a bounder, {{with one}} of those rakish {{military}} caps whose soft tops cock sideways or backwards. He was in Italian khaki, <b>riding-breeches</b> and puttees. He smoked his cigarette bounderishly: but at the same time, with peculiar gentleness, he handed one to the ginger Hamlet. Hamlet accepted it, and his mate held him a light as the bus swung on. They were like man and wife. The mate was the alert and wide-eyed Jane Eyre whom the ginger Mr. Rochester was not going to spoil in a hurry.|$|E
6000|$|Presently {{coming up}} this Road towards us I saw a man dressed in a green coat, <b>riding-breeches</b> and boots and a peaked cap, who held in his hand a hunting-whip. He was a fine-looking person of middle age, with a pleasant, open countenance, bright blue eyes, and very red cheeks, on which he wore light-coloured whiskers. In short a jovial-looking individual, with whom things had evidently always gone well, one to whom sorrow and {{disappointment}} and mental struggle were utter strangers. He, at least, had never known {{what it is to}} [...] "endure hardness" [...] in all his life.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was at a}} {{table for}} six. She was {{listening}} to a man of thirty in <b>riding-breeches,</b> a stock, and a pointed nose, who bowed to her every time he spoke, which was so frequently that his dining {{gave the impression of}} a man eating grape-fruit on a merry-go-round. Back in Schoenstrom, fortified by Mac and the bunch at the Old Home Lunch, Milt would have called the man a [...] "dude," [...] and--though less noisily than the others--would have yelped, [...] "Get onto Percy's beer-bottle pants. What's he got his neck bandaged for? Bet he's got a boil." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was Lieutenant Forrest Haviland, {{detailed}} by the army--Haviland {{the perfect}} gentle knight, the well-beloved, the nearest {{approach to the}} gracious fiction aviator of them all, yet never drawling in affected modesty, never afraid of grease; smiling and industrious and reticent; smooth of hair and cameo of face; wearing khaki <b>riding-breeches</b> and tan puttees instead of overalls; always a gentleman, even {{when he tried to}} appear a workman. He pretended to be enthusiastic about the lunch-wagon, and never referred to his three generations of army officers. But most of the others were shy of him, and Jack Ryan, the [...] "school grouch," [...] was always trying to get him into a fight.|$|E
60|$|The big ax {{flashed in}} the {{sunshine}} and bit deep into a poplar trunk; but when a few more logs had been laid beside the rest the men stopped again, for they heard a beat of hoofs coming toward them across the prairie. The trees cut off {{their view of the}} rider, but when he rounded a corner of the bluff and pulled up his horse, they saw a young lad, picturesquely dressed in a deerskin jacket of Indian make, decorated with fringed hide and embroidery, cord <b>riding-breeches,</b> and polished leggings. His slouch hat was pushed back on his head, showing a handsome face that had in it a touch of imperiousness.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, he {{felt very}} weak {{and very much}} {{depressed}} as he rode up the street of the little town and dismounted at the hotel. The sidewalks were littered with loafing cowboys and lumber-jacks, {{and some of them}} quite openly ridiculed his <b>riding-breeches</b> and his thin legs. Others merely grinned, but in their grins lay something more insulting than words. [...] "To them I am a poor thing," [...] he admitted; but as he lifted his eyes to the mighty semicircular wall of the Bear Tooth Range, over which the daily storm was playing, he forgot his small worries. What gorgeous pageantry! What life-giving air! [...] "If only civilized men and women possessed this glorious valley, what a place it would be!" [...] he exclaimed, and in the heat of his indignant contempt he would have swept the valley clean.|$|E
60|$|Afterwards we {{went out}} in the town, Reynolds and I, and began our shopping. I was {{measured}} at the principal tailor's for more clothes than it seemed possible for me to wear out in a lifetime, from <b>riding-breeches</b> to a dress-coat; and the quantity and variety of hats, boots, shirts, and ties which Reynolds put down as indispensable filled me with half-amused astonishment, although I had made up my mind to be surprised at nothing. But our shopping was not finished even when Reynolds, to my inexpressible relief, declared my wardrobe to be as complete as could be furnished by a provincial town. The gunsmith's, the sporting emporium, and the horse-repository were all visited in turn. And when we returned to the hotel about six o'clock I was the possessor of two guns, which were a perfect revelation to me, a cricket-bat, a tennis racquet, a small gymnasium, a set of foils, and, besides other things, a stylish, well-built dogcart and a sound, useful cob.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the right}} spirit, and I wish I could go with you; but my troop will wear a sort of uniform, Norfolk jackets and <b>riding-breeches,</b> and the outfitters are so {{overwhelmed}} with orders {{that it will be}} another couple of days at least before they are ready. Then the men must have two or three days' drill before they start; I am still short of horses, so I will ride on and see Duncan. I want thirty-five more, and as yet, although subscriptions are coming in well, we are still a good deal short of our requirements. However, I dare say I shall be able to make some arrangement with Duncan, as I shall probably have enough to pay him in full {{by the end of the}} week. Altogether, I don't suppose I shall be ready to start for another ten days, and unless the Boers delay their advance I am afraid that I shall not get to Dundee." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{laugh at}} her, {{but are we}} so very much better? Come, my {{superior}} male friend, have you never stood, amid your wardrobe, undecided whether, in her eyes, you would appear more imposing, clad in the rough tweed suit that so admirably displays your broad shoulders; or in the orthodox black frock, that, after all, is perhaps more suitable to {{the figure of a}} man approaching--let us say, the nine-and-twenties? Or, better still, why not riding costume? Did we not hear her say how well Jones looked in his top-boots and breeches, and, [...] "hang it all," [...] we have a better leg than Jones. What a pity <b>riding-breeches</b> are made so baggy nowadays. Why is it that male fashions tend more and more to hide the male leg? As women have become less and less ashamed of theirs, we have become more and more reticent of ours. Why are the silken hose, the tight-fitting pantaloons, the neat kneebreeches of our forefathers impossible to-day? Are we grown more modest--or has there come about a falling off, rendering concealment advisable? ...|$|E
6000|$|Though {{she was the}} {{daughter}} of Howard Littlefield, that wrought-iron fact-mill, that horse-faced priest of private ownership, Eunice was a midge in the sun. She danced into the house, she flung herself into Babbitt's lap when he was reading, she crumpled his paper, and laughed at him when he adequately explained that he hated a crumpled newspaper as he hated a broken sales-contract. She was seventeen now. Her ambition was to be a cinema actress. She did not merely attend the showing of every [...] "feature film;" [...] she also read the motion-picture magazines, those extraordinary symptoms of the Age of Pep-monthlies and weeklies gorgeously illustrated with portraits of young women who had recently been manicure girls, not very skilful manicure girls, and who, unless their every grimace had been arranged by a director, could not have acted in the Easter cantata of the Central Methodist Church; magazines reporting, quite seriously, in [...] "interviews" [...] plastered with pictures of <b>riding-breeches</b> and California bungalows, the views on sculpture and international politics of blankly beautiful, suspiciously beautiful young men; outlining the plots of films about pure prostitutes and kind-hearted train-robbers; and giving directions for making bootblacks into Celebrated Scenario Authors overnight.|$|E
6000|$|The street-cars, {{which in}} Valladolid are poetically {{propelled}} through lyre-shaped trolleys instead of our prosaic broomstick appliances, groaned unheeded if not unheard under our windows through the night, and we woke {{to find the}} sun on duty in our glazed balcony and the promenade below already astir with life: not the exuberant young life of the night before, but still sufficiently awake to be recognizable as life. A crippled newsboy seated {{under one of the}} arcades was crying his papers; an Englishman was looking at a plan of Valladolid in a shop window; a splendid cavalry officer went by in braided uniform, and did not stare so hard as they might have expected at some ladies passing in mantillas to mass or market. In the late afternoon as well as the early morning we saw {{a good deal of the}} military in Valladolid, where an army corps is stationed. From time to time a company of infantry marched through the streets to gay music, and toward evening slim young officers began to frequent the arcades and glass themselves in the windows of the shops, their spurs clinking on the pavement as they lounged by or stopped and took distinguished attitudes. We speculated in vain as to their social quality, and to this day I do not know whether [...] "the career is open to the talents" [...] in the Spanish army, or whether military rank is merely the just reward of civil rank. Those beautiful young swells in <b>riding-breeches</b> and tight gray jackets approached an Italian type of cavalry officer; they did not look very vigorous, and the common soldiers we saw marching through the streets, largely followed by the populace, were not of formidable stature or figure, though neat and agreeable enough to the eye.|$|E
6000|$|This first one, who {{had just}} {{dismounted}} from his bay polo-pony, was Mortimer, of the Intelligence--tall, straight, and hawk-faced, with khaki tunic and <b>riding-breeches,</b> drab putties, a scarlet cummerbund, and a skin tanned to the red of a Scotch fir by sun and wind, and mottled by the mosquito and the sand-fly. The other--small, quick, mercurial, with blue-black, curling beard and hair, a fly-switch for ever flicking in his left hand--was Scott, of the Courier, who had come through more dangers and brought off more brilliant coups than any man in the profession, save the eminent Chandler, now no longer in a condition to take the field. They were a singular contrast, Mortimer and Scott, {{and it was in}} their differences that the secret of their close friendship lay. Each dovetailed into the other. The strength of each was in the other's weakness. [...] Together they formed a perfect unit. Mortimer was Saxon--slow, conscientious, and deliberate; Scott was Celtic--quick, happy-go-lucky, and brilliant. Mortimer was the more solid, Scott the more attractive. Mortimer was the deeper thinker, Scott the brighter talker. By a curious coincidence, though each had seen much of warfare, their campaigns had never coincided. Together they covered all recent military history. Scott had done Plevna, the Shipka, the Zulus, Egypt, Suakim; Mortimer had seen the Boer War, the Chilian, the Bulgaria and Servian, the Gordon relief, the Indian frontier, Brazilian rebellion, and Madagascar. This intimate personal knowledge gave a peculiar flavour to their talk. There was none of the second-hand surmise and conjecture which form so much of our conversation; it was all concrete and final. The speaker had been there, had seen it, and there was an end of it.|$|E
60|$|I {{sat down}} on a rush chair by the long window that looked out into the yard. As he was reading, and as it took all his mother's powers to watch the {{potatoes}} boil and the meat roast, I was left to my thoughts. George, indifferent to all claims, continued to read. It was very annoying to watch him pulling his brown moustache, and reading indolently while the dog rubbed against his leggings and against the knee of his old <b>riding-breeches.</b> He would not even be at the trouble to play with Trip's ears, he was so content with his novel and his moustache. Round and round twirled his thick fingers, and the muscles of his bare arm moved slightly under the red-brown skin. The little square window above him filtered a green light from the foliage of the great horse-chestnut outside and the glimmer fell on his dark hair, and trembled across the plates which Annie was reaching down from the rack, and across the face of the tall clock. The kitchen was very big; the table looked lonely, and the chairs mourned darkly for the lost companionship of the sofa; the chimney was a black cavern away at the back, and the inglenook seats shut in another little compartment ruddy with fire-light, where the mother hovered. It was rather a desolate kitchen, such a bare expanse of uneven grey flagstones, such far-away dark corners and sober furniture. The only gay things were the chintz coverings of the sofa and the arm-chair cushions, bright red in the bare sombre room; some might smile at the old clock, adorned as it was with remarkable and vivid poultry; in me it only provoked wonder and contemplation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Name, Ruth Winslow. Age, between {{twenty and}} thirty. Father, Mason Winslow, {{manufacturing}} contractor for concrete. Brothers, Mason Winslow, Jr., whose poor dear head is getting somewhat bald, as you observe, and Bobby Winslow, ne'er-do-weel, who {{is engaged in}} subverting discipline at medical school, and who dances divinely. My mother died three years ago. I do nothing useful, but I play a good game of bridge and possess a voice that those as know pronounce passable. I have a speaking knowledge of French, a reading knowledge of German, and a singing knowledge of Italian. I am wearing an imported gown, for which the House of Winslow will probably never pay. I live in this house, and am Episcopalian--not so much High Church as highly infrequent church. I regard the drawing-room down-stairs as the worst example of late-Victorian abominations in my knowledge, but I shall probably never persuade father to change it because Mason thinks it is sacred to the past. My ambition {{in life is to}} be catty to the Newport set after I've married an English diplomat with a divine mustache. Never having met such a personage outside of Tatler and Vogue, I can't give you very many details regarding him. Oh yes, of course, he'll have to play a marvelous game of polo and have a château in Provençe and also a ranch in Texas, where I shall wear <b>riding-breeches</b> and live next to Nature and have a Chinese cook in blue silk. I think that's my whole history. Oh, I forgot. I play at the piano and am very ignorant, and completely immersed in the worst traditions of the wealthy Micks of the Upper West Side, and I always pretend that I live here instead of on the Upper East Side because 'the air is better.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|That isn't {{where the}} indelicacy comes in. She went out riding with me, which was entirely her own suggestion, {{and as we}} were coming home through some meadows she made a quite {{unnecessary}} attempt to see if her pony would jump a rather messy sort of brook that was there. It wouldn't. It went with her {{as far as the}} water's edge, and from that point Mrs. Nicorax went on alone. Of course I had to fish her out from the bank, and my <b>riding-breeches</b> are not cut with a view to salmon-fishing--it's rather an art even to ride in them. Her habit-skirt was one of those open questions that need not be adhered to in emergencies, and on this occasion it remained behind in some water-weeds. She wanted me to fish about for that too, but I felt I had done enough Pharaoh's daughter business for an October afternoon, and I was beginning to want my tea. So I bundled her up on to her pony, and gave her a lead towards home as fast as I cared to go. What with the wet and the unusual responsibility, her abridged costume did not stand the pace particularly well, and she got quite querulous when I shouted back that I had no pins with me--and no string. Some women expect so much from a fellow. When we got into the drive she wanted to go up the back way to the stables, but the ponies know they always get sugar at the front door, and I never attempt to hold a pulling pony; as for Mrs. Nicorax, it took her all she knew to keep a firm hand on her seceding garments, which, as her maid remarked afterwards, were more tout than ensemble. Of course nearly the whole house-party were out on the lawn watching the sunset--the only day this month that it's occurred to the sun to show itself, as Mrs. Nic. viciously observed--and I shall never forget the expression on her husband's face as we pulled up. [...] "My darling, this is too much!" [...] was his first spoken comment; taking into consideration the state of her toilet, it was the most brilliant thing I had ever heard him say, and I went into the library to be alone and scream. Mrs. Nicorax says I have no delicacy.|$|E

Note plumed, engraved helmet, bronze muscle cuirass, red mantle, red sash tied over cuirass indicating equestrian rank, pteruges.

The imperial tribune's equipment was virtually unchanged since Republican times (see above) ...|$|E
50|$|Schwaller de Lubicz was {{the founder}} in 1919, {{with other members}} of the Theosophical Society, of the esoteric right-wing French group called Affranchis, that {{published}} a journal L'Affranchi-Hiérarchie, Fraternité, Liberté, a monthly journal of art and philosophy, dealing with a spiritual and social renewal within the framework of a mystical political philosophy. Its president was René Bruyez. On 23 July 1919 the group dissolved and another group was formed in its place: Les Veilleurs ("the Vigilants"), to which allegedly the young Rudolf Hess belonged (according to the historian Pierre Mariel). Its uniform consisted of a dark shirt, high-boots and <b>riding-breeches,</b> akin to the Sturmabteilung.|$|E
