50|$|The {{requirements}} for an ideal paper machine online sensor include the following: the sensor is calibrated {{to a natural}} constant during the measurement; the sensor and the related electronics include fault diagnostics; digital processing of the signal is possible from the start without destroying the possibility of analyzing large frequency components; the sensor system does not disturb the production; the measurements are performed real-time and can be adjusted without delays; the measurement concerns the entire production, not just small sample values. It must be possible {{to distinguish between the}} machine-directional and cross-directional deviation and the <b>residual</b> <b>deviation</b> as the control system handles these three deviations separately and in different ways. The earlier systems calculated a long-term average profile to filter the profile. As several quality profiles can be adjusted automatically it is important to get the right profile data with high resolution quickly to the control system. This is especially important during changes, after breaks and during grade changes. In advanced systems, algorithms are used to calculate the profile data.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Helical tomotherapy is a {{modality}} {{of radiation}} treatment delivery which {{is equipped with}} an on-board imaging device (MVCT) allowing for daily patient set-up verification and correction in the medial-lateral (m-l), cranial-caudal (c-c), anterior-posterior (a-p) and transversal angular (roll) directions. In this study, we measured set-up deviations and evaluated different MVCT protocols for brain and head and neck (H&N) cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The daily set-up errors of 75 H&N cancer patients immobilized with 5 -point fixation thermoplastic masks and 30 brain cancer patients immobilized with 3 -point fixation thermoplastic masks were detected by matching the MVCT with the treatment planning CT images. This co-registration procedure was accomplished automatically by the system's software (automatic deviations), then corrected manually by the radiation therapists (total deviations). Systematic and random errors were analyzed on a patient and a population basis. Moreover, 2 MVCT protocols were retrospectively evaluated; MVCTs were either acquired during the first five fractions (FFFs) or on alternate week (ALT). Systematic deviations were calculated based upon prior "MVCT" fractions and applied during the "non-MVCT" fractions. The resulting <b>residual</b> <b>deviations</b> were then analyzed. RESULTS: The total systematic (and random) deviations reached 1. 7 mm (1. 4 mm), 1. 6 mm (1. 5 mm), 1. 5 mm (1. 5 mm) and 0. 6 degrees (0. 6 degrees) for H&N cancer patients and reached 1. 6 mm (0. 9 mm), 1. 7 mm (1. 1 mm), 1. 1 mm (0. 8 mm) and 0. 9 degrees (0. 6 degrees) for brain cancer patients in the m-l, c-c, a-p and roll directions, respectively. A t-test detected small but {{statistically significant differences between}} the automatic and total deviations. Both MVCT protocols gave rise to similar <b>residual</b> <b>deviations.</b> However, for H&N cancer patients the ALT protocol resulted in smaller <b>residual</b> <b>deviations</b> and CTV-PTV margins, particularly in the a-p direction. CONCLUSION: The total systematic and random deviations were comparable to the previously published data. No clinical difference exists between the automatic and total deviations.

INTRODUCTION: Monocular surgery may preserve some muscles if a repeat operation is required, may help to avoid the exposure of the dominant eye to the inherent risks of a surgical procedure and may reduce surgical time. METHODS: We evaluated ninety-two consecutive patients who underwent monocular surgery under peribulbar anesthesia for large-angle horizontal strabismus (angle of 40 prism diopters or greater). Patients were divided into group 1 - esotropia and group 2 -exotropia. The postoperative follow-up was at 6 months, when the <b>residual</b> <b>deviation</b> was evaluated. In cases of residual deviations of over 15 PD (prism diopter), a second procedure was indicated. RESULTS: In all patients with preoperative deviations up to 60 PD, residual deviations were under 15 PD.

The monthly records {{of the weight of}} 10 captive female collared peccaries over a period of two years in the Brazilian Amazon Region were used. The growth models used were the Von Bertalanffy, Brody, Gompertz and Logistic. The parameters were estimated by using the NLIN procedure from the SAS application. The criteria used to verify the adjustment of the models were: asymptotic standard deviation (ASD); coefficient of determination (R²); average absolute <b>residual</b> <b>deviation</b> (ARD) and the asymptotic rate (AR). The Brody model and the Logistic model estimated the highest (19. 44 kg) and the lowest (19. 18 kg) asymptotic weight (A), indicating the lowest (0. 0070 kg/day) and the highest (0. 0121 kg/day) maturation rate (K). These results and the coefficients of phenotypic correlation that varied from - 0. 75 and - 0. 47 confirmed the antagonistic nature between these parameters. The Brody model estimated the lower value for ARD, a limiting factor for describing the lowest value for AR through this model. The Brody model showed the best adjustment for AR, although the other models also showed a suitable adjustment to the weight data of said species/gender. Based on the AR obtained in this work, the Brody model is recommended for adjusting the growth curve of the female collared peccaries.

Within the types of renewable energies, wind energy could be considered asone with large potential. In this paper I present the study of a Swedish wind farm placed in Rockneby. Once the wind turbines were installed and working correctly, a discrepancy between the realenergy obtained and the theoretical energy indicated by the manufacturer was detected. Thestored data in the SCADA system were compared with the values provided by the manufacturerand several analyses were performed. Initially an anomaly in the power <b>residual</b> <b>deviation</b> wasdetected. It was showing an unusual behaviour at high wind speeds. The variation of the airdensity in the wind farm at hub height was considered as a possible reason of the disagreementobserved in the power parameters since the reference density used by the manufacturer was aconstant value calculated in laboratory environment. However, this idea was rejected becausethe power generated in both conditions is similar. The pitch angle was analysed after detectinga significant variations in wind speed measurements made by the anemometer in the turbinenumber three. As a result, it was found a pitch variation in the turbine which seems due to afailure in the anemometer.

40|$|PURPOSE: This paper reports {{an outcome}} study of 52 {{consecutive}} children treated by bilateral lateral rectus recession for intermittent exotropia over a 9 year period (1981 - 90) {{with a minimum}} follow up of 6 months. METHODS: Successful alignment {{was defined as the}} absence of any postoperative intermittent or constant tropia in any position of gaze. The study examined the variables that might be predictive of successful alignment. The charts were abstracted for age at initial surgery, quantity of initial deviation, initial refraction, motor alignment at 1 week and 6 months, final alignment, secondary surgery results and the incidence of a monofixation syndrome result. RESULTS: Motor tests demonstrated that 32 (62 %) of the patients were successfully aligned by the initial procedure performed for a mean of 25 prism diopters of preoperative deviation while viewing distant targets at a mean age of 4 years 8 months, followed for a mean of 4 years, 4 months. The incidence of undercorrections and overcorrections were approximately equal in quantity suggesting that the current surgical dosage was adequate, but the age at initial surgery, initial deviation, initial refraction and 1 week postoperative alignment results were not predictive of success. Alignment at 6 months, however, was highly correlated with successful alignment {{by the end of the}} study (p = 0. 002). Secondary surgery was performed for 11 patients and 5 patients were found to have a monofixation syndrome result.
