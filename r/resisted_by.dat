5|$|U.S. Marines, {{under the}} overall command of U.S. Major General Alexander Vandegrift, {{captured}} {{the islands of}} Tulagi, Gavutu, and Tanambogo among which the Japanese Navy had constructed a naval and seaplane base. The landings were fiercely <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> the Japanese Navy troops who, outnumbered and outgunned by the Allied forces, fought and died almost to the last man.|$|E
5|$|During construction, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill {{attempted}} {{to arrange for}} Australia to remain in British waters on completion. Although the claim was made on strategic grounds, the reasoning behind it was so the Australian-funded ship could replace one to be purchased with British defence funds. This plan was successfully <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> Admiral George King-Hall, then Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's Australia Squadron.|$|E
5|$|San Martín began {{immediately}} {{to organize the}} Army of the Andes. He drafted all the citizens who could bear arms and all the slaves from ages 16 to 30, requested reinforcements to Buenos Aires, and reorganized the economy for war production. He took another leave to restore his health four months after taking power, so Alvear appointed Gregorio Perdriel. This appointment was <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> the Mendoza Cabildo, which ratified San Martín.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{official}} Belgian {{withdrawal from the}} Western Alliance, the Belgians refused to engage in any official staff meetings with the French or British military staff for fear of compromising its neutrality. The Belgians did not regard a German invasion as inevitable and were determined that if an invasion did take place it would be effectively <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> new fortifications such as Eben Emael.|$|E
5|$|Assimilation efforts {{began as}} early as the 17th century with the arrival of French colonists in New France. They were <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> Indigenous {{communities}} who were unwilling to leave their children for extended periods and who came to associate missionaries with the diseases devastating Indigenous populations. The establishment of day and boarding schools by groups including the Récollets, Jesuits and Ursulines was largely abandoned by the 1690s. The political instability and realities of colonial life also {{played a role in the}} decision to halt the education programs. An increase in orphaned and foundling colonial children limited church resources, and colonists benefited from favourable relations with Indigenous peoples in both the fur trade and military pursuits.|$|E
5|$|Brown began {{researching and}} writing Bodyguard of Lies in 1961. Most of the {{material}} is based on oral testimony from Second World War intelligence personnel, as well as records from the National Archives and declassified American records (although Brown says {{that most of the}} book was written before he was able to access the latter, in 1974). Brown wrote Bodyguard of Lies at a time when details of both cryptography and deception during the war were still classified. His attempts at research was <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> the British and American governments; he was denied access to British war records and had to undertake considerable work to obtain US records via Freedom of Information requests.|$|E

5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed into public {{ownership}} with the Transport Act 1947. Despite concerted efforts, the Conservators could not make any progress with {{the removal of the}} fixed low-level bridges, which prevented maintenance from being carried out. The Inland Waterways Association started to take an active interest in the restoration {{of the canal}} from 1952, but this was <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> the British Transport Commission, who padlocked the lock gates to prevent them being used. Despite this, a team of seven men was employed to maintain the infrastructure through this period. The maintenance of the channel enabled the canal {{to become one of the}} first to be used for the commercial transport of water, which was pumped from the canal to Durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, the National Association of Colored Women {{was formed}} to promote the needs of black women. Bethune served as the Florida chapter {{president}} of the NACW from 1917 to 1925. She worked to register black voters, which was <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> white society and had been made almost impossible {{by a variety of}} obstacles in Florida law and practices controlled by white administrators. She was threatened by members of the resurgent Ku Klux Klan in those years. Bethune also served {{as the president of the}} Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs from 1920 to 1925, which worked to improve opportunities for black women.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{to merge}} the grammar {{school with the}} two {{secondary}} modern establishments to form a comprehensive school were <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> the Grammar School's governors; in a voluntary-aided school, the local education authority was responsible for its finances, but the governors and headmaster had autonomy over all other school policy. As {{a result of the}} governors' refusal, the LEA ceased to maintain the school, which became legally independent on 1 September 1983. The separate Queen's Schools, meanwhile, were merged to become a co-educational comprehensive school, now named Thomas Clarkson Academy.|$|E
5000|$|The vis insita, or innate {{force of}} matter, {{is a power}} of <b>resisting</b> <b>by</b> which every body, {{as much as in}} it lies, {{endeavours}} to preserve its present state, whether it be of rest or of moving uniformly forward in a straight line.|$|R
60|$|Yet must I confess, {{continued}} the parrot, that, as a rule, the beautiful woman is more virtuous than the ugly. The former is often tempted, but her vanity and conceit enable her to <b>resist,</b> <b>by</b> the self-promise that she shall be tempted again and again. On the other hand, the ugly woman must tempt {{instead of being}} tempted, and she must yield, because her vanity and conceit are gratified by yielding, not <b>by</b> <b>resisting.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{evolutionary}} foundations of altruism among siblings and extends biologists' kin-selection theory to a richer class of games between relatives. It {{shows that a}} population will <b>resist</b> invasion <b>by</b> dominant mutant genes if individuals maximize a "semi-Kantian" utility function in games with their siblings. It is shown that a population that <b>resists</b> invasion <b>by</b> dominant mutants may be invaded by recessive mutants. Conditions are found under which a population <b>resists</b> invasion <b>by</b> dominant and also by recessive mutants. (JEL C 70, D 10, D 63...|$|R
5|$|The II SS-Panzer Corps {{continued}} its attack toward Prokhorovka on 11 July. The advance of Leibstandarte was checked by the 2nd Tank Corps, {{which had been}} reinforced by the 9th Guards Airborne Division and 301st Anti-tank Artillery Regiment, both from the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps. Totenkopf was <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> the 31st Tank Corps, the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps' 95th Guards Rifle Division, and the 11th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 10th Tank Corps. To the south of Leibstandarte, the 2nd Guards Tank Corps and the 48th Rifle Corps' 183rd Rifle Division opposed the advance of Das Reich.|$|E
5|$|The {{customs law}} set trade {{barriers}} to products {{produced in the}} country, and imposed high import tariffs on luxury goods, together with export quotas and tariffs on gold and silver. However, the law was not completely effective because of {{the control of the}} port, which did not allow the provinces a steady financial income. The exclusive control of the port was long <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> federals from other provinces, and led to the conflict of Rosas and Justo José de Urquiza at the battle of Caseros. Despite the financial obstacles, the economy of Entre Ríos has grew to a size near that of Buenos Aires, with the decline of saladeros and the growth of wool production.|$|E
5|$|Although {{beyond their}} jurisdiction, the Navigation commissioners {{attempted}} {{to extend their}} powers, to improve the river below the junction with Aike Beck. They particularly wanted to replace the stone Hull Bridge, near Beverley, with a swing bridge, {{which would make it}} easier for keels to reach Frodingham bridge. The Corporation of Beverley objected, because the bridge was the main route of communication between Beverley and Holderness, and the commissioners instead dredged parts of the river to improve access. Plans to improve Hull Bridge were again <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> Beverley Corporation in 1799, but an agreement was finally reached in 1801, and an Act of Parliament was obtained in July of that year. William Chapman acted as engineer, as the act authorised the construction of towpaths, a new cut between Bethels Bridge and the lock at Struncheon Hill, to avoid a long loop in the river, and rebuilding of the bridge. The bridge cost £500, half of which was met by Richard Bethell, the owner of the Leven Canal, on condition that the tolls for passing through it were reduced significantly.|$|E

25|$|An {{entire region}} can become debilitated because some {{critical}} {{elements in the}} infrastructure become disabled through natural disaster. While potentially in contravention of the Geneva Conventions, military forces have also recognized that it can cripple an enemy's ability to <b>resist</b> <b>by</b> attacking key elements of its civilian and military infrastructure.|$|R
6000|$|A buoyant {{temperament}} is of all moral qualities {{the most}} precious, in this respect; {{it is the}} one force in us--when virtuous resolution proves insufficient--which <b>resists</b> <b>by</b> instinct the stealthy approaches of despair.

5|$|Rix Nicholas {{continued}} to experience success in her exhibitions and with regular favourable reviews in the press, such {{as for her}} show in the Queen Victoria Markets in September 1920. Nevertheless, Pigot has argued that {{her place in the}} Australian art world at the time was complex, and her style was affected by vigorous debate around the emergence of modernism, which was being <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> local critics. Her experience of this more conservative Australia, and the effects of the deaths of all those close to her, contributed to Rix Nicholas abandoning her more experimental art, and returning to more academic and figurative subjects. This ultimately had a detrimental effect on the long-term trajectory of her career. Pigot also argues that her refusal to conform to the gendered expectations of the Australian artistic establishment led to her rejection.|$|E
5|$|The Peninsular War in Spain, {{along with}} the capture of the king Ferdinand VII and {{the fall of the}} Junta of Seville, {{escalated}} political disputes in Buenos Aires that led to the May Revolution. Several criollos thought that the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, appointed by the fallen Junta, did not have legitimacy, and requested an open cabildo to discuss it. Azcuénaga attended it, and voted {{for the creation of a}} Junta with deputies from all the provinces, with the Cabildo ruling in the interregnum. However, the majority agreed with the creation of a junta, but with another junta of people from Buenos ruling during in the meantime. The viceroy tried to stay in government as president of the Junta, which was <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> the criollos. Azcuénaga lend his house to their secret meetings. Azcuénaga was appointed as a member of the new Primera Junta, and promoted to brigadier. The reasons of Azcuénaga's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists, Alzaguists, the military and the clergy; besides being from the armed forces, Azcuénaga had close ties with the rich people of the city.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from London, the Demerara Court of Policy eventually passed an 'Ordinance for the religious instruction of slaves and for meliorating their condition' in 1825 which institutionalised working hours and some civil rights for slaves. The weekend {{was to be}} from sunset on Saturday to sunrise on Monday; field work was also defined to be from 6 am to 6 pm, with a mandatory two-hour break. A Protector of Slaves was appointed; whipping was abolished for women as was its use in the field. The rights to marriage and own property was legalised, as was the right to acquire manumission. Amendments and new ordinances continued to flow from London, each progressively establishing more civil rights for the slaves, but they were strongly <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> the colonial legislature.|$|E
50|$|At {{first the}} guilds of dyers in Venice {{and other cities}} banned {{cochineal}} to protect their local products, but the superior quality of cochineal dye {{made it impossible to}} <b>resist.</b> <b>By</b> the beginning of the 17th century it was the preferred luxury red for the clothing of cardinals, bankers, courtesans and aristocrats.|$|R
50|$|Receiving no {{help from}} the Field Cornet of the ward, he {{proceeded}} to the nearest military post, commanded by Captain Andrews armed with a letter asked for military assistance. While Bezuidenhout was preparing to <b>resist,</b> <b>by</b> force, his arrest, Lieutenant F Rousseau accompanied the Deputy-Messenger with a patrol of twelve Khoikhoi soldiers.|$|R
50|$|Military {{resistance}} {{was limited to}} occasional sabotage to both key civil and military installations, with most <b>resisting</b> <b>by</b> avoiding postings to the active war fronts. Most armed {{resistance was}} undertaken in Carinthia. Carinthian Slovenes formed a nucleus to the resistance after targeted deportations and forced Germanisation by the Nazi regime in 1942 led {{to the establishment of}} forest bands.|$|R
5|$|While Governor Shirley was at Louisbourg trouble {{had been}} brewing between the Royal Navy {{and the people}} of Boston. The Navy had long sought to press Americans into service on its ships. Impressment was a long-standing {{practice}} in Britain, but its application in America was <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> the colonists. In 1702 Fort William on Castle Island had fired on HMS Swift as it tried to leave Boston Harbour with six recently impressed men aboard. As a result of American complaints (reinforced by British merchants), Parliament in 1708 banned impressment in the American colonies. Navy leaders argued that the American exemption from impressment had been in force only during Queen Anne's War, which ended in 1713. In practice, Royal Navy captains had to apply to colonial governors for a license to press men. In late November 1745 a fight between a press gang and some sailors staying in a boarding house in Boston left two of the sailors with fatal injuries. Two members of the press gang were charged with murder and convicted, but were released when the indictment was found invalid.|$|E
5|$|Cornelio Saavedra {{was aware}} that the Junta would be <b>{{resisted}}</b> <b>by</b> factions still loyal to the old authorities. It was resisted locally by the Cabildo and the Royal Audiencia; the nearby plazas of Montevideo and Paraguay did not recognize it; and Santiago de Liniers organized a counter-revolution at Córdoba. During this early period, the Junta worked united against the royalist threats. Mariano Moreno, the secretary of war, drafted the decrees and regulations to deal with royalists. First, a decree ordered punishment for anyone attempting to generate disputes, and for those concealing conspiracies against the Junta or other people. The Royal Audiencia swore loyalty to the Regency Council, in defiance to the Junta, so they were summoned, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled to Spain with the pretext {{that there was a}} threat to their lives. The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno organized as well the Paraguay campaign and the First Upper Peru campaign, to the plazas that resisted the Junta. The second one, headed by Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo, would move to Córdoba and attack the counter-revolution; before marching to Upper Peru. Ocampo's initial orders were to capture the counter-revolutionary leaders and send them to Buenos Aires, so that they could be judged. When the counter-revolution became stronger Moreno called the Junta and proposed that the enemy leaders should be shot {{as soon as they were}} captured instead of brought to trial. The new orders were carried out by Juan José Castelli. Cornelio Saavedra supported all these measures.|$|E
5|$|In the Ogulin {{area of the}} HV Karlovac Corps AOR, the 99th Brigade, {{reinforced}} by the 143rd Home Guard Regiment's Saborsko Company, moved towards Plaški at 5a.m., but the force was stopped and turned back in disarray by 6p.m. The 143rd Home Guard Regiment advanced from Josipdol towards Plaški, encountering minefields and strong ARSK resistance. Its elements connected with the 14th Home Guard Regiment, advancing through Barilović towards Slunj. Near the city of Karlovac, the 137th Home Guard Regiment deployed four reconnaissance groups around midnight of 34 August, followed by artillery preparation and crossing of the Korana River at 5a.m. The advance was fiercely <b>resisted</b> <b>by</b> the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade, but the bridgehead was stable {{by the end of}} the day. The 110th Home Guard Regiment, {{reinforced by}} a company of the 137th Home Guard Regiment, advanced east to the road leading south from Karlovac to Vojnić and Slunj, where it met heavy resistance and suffered more casualties to landmines, demoralizing the unit and preventing its further advance. In addition, the attached company of the 137th Home Guard Regiment and the 104th Brigade failed to secure the regiment's flanks. The 104th Brigade tried to cross the Kupa River at 5a.m., but failed and fell back to its starting position by 8a.m., at which time it was shifted to the bridgehead established by the 110th Home Guard Regiment. A company of the 99th Brigade was attached to the 143rd Home Guard Regiment for operations the next day, and a 250-strong battlegroup was removed from the brigade and subordinated to the Karlovac Corps directly.|$|E
50|$|The Anglo-Thai Non-Aggression Pact was {{concluded}} in Bangkok on 12 June 1940 between {{the governments of}} the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Thailand. It {{was concluded}} as part of the British policy at that time of refraining from <b>resisting</b> <b>by</b> force the actions of the Japanese Empire in East Asia, as Thailand was about to become Japan's ally.|$|R
5000|$|The {{documentary}} Do Not <b>Resist</b> <b>by</b> Craig Atkinson is {{also critical}} of the phenomenon of police militarization, as exemplified by law enforcement training courses taught by retired military officer Dave Grossman, who tells police officers, [...] "You are {{men and women of}} violence.” The film won the award for [...] "Best Documentary Feature" [...] at the Tribeca Film Festival.|$|R
