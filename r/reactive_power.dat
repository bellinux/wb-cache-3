5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E
25|$|Electrical loads {{consuming}} {{alternating current}} power consume both real power and <b>reactive</b> <b>power.</b> The vector sum of real and <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> is the apparent power. The presence of <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> causes {{the real power}} {{to be less than}} the apparent power, and so, the electric load has a power factor of less than 1.|$|E
25|$|Power factor {{correction}} brings the power factor of an AC power circuit closer to 1 by supplying or absorbing <b>reactive</b> <b>power,</b> adding capacitors or inductors that act {{to cancel the}} inductive or capacitive effects of the load, respectively. In the case of offsetting the inductive effect of motor loads, capacitors can be locally connected. These capacitors help to generate <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> {{to meet the demand}} of the inductive loads. This will keep that <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> from having to flow {{all the way from the}} utility generator to the load. In the electricity industry, inductors are said to consume <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> and capacitors are said to supply it, even though <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> is just energy moving back and forth on each AC cycle.|$|E
30|$|Loads: The {{active and}} <b>reactive</b> <b>powers</b> of load 1 are 400  MW and 100 MVAr, respectively. The active and <b>reactive</b> <b>powers</b> of load 2 are 100  MW and 50 MVAr, respectively.|$|R

30|$|PΣQΣ: {{traditional}} three-phase AC machines {{as well as}} IBDERs and DFIMs can {{be represented}} with this bus type. In accordance with [89], the control strategy of the DER connected to this bus type consists of specifying the injected three-phase real and <b>reactive</b> <b>powers</b> control. Due to the unsymmetrical system state, the real and <b>reactive</b> <b>powers</b> at the PCC of DER are not equally distributed per phase. Therefore, representing this control strategy with the traditional single-phase PQ bus type, per each phase, would introduce calculation errors. The shortcoming could be omitted by using the PΣQΣ bus type. For the three-phase real and <b>reactive</b> <b>powers</b> are known variables, while the three sequence components of phase voltages are unknown state variables.|$|R
25|$|Energy {{stored in}} {{capacitive}} or inductive {{elements of the}} network give rise to <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> flow. <b>Reactive</b> <b>power</b> flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network. Voltage levels and <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within acceptable limits. A technique known as reactive compensation is used to reduce apparent power flow to a load by reducing <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally. For example, to compensate an inductive load a shunt capacitor is installed close to the load itself. This allows all <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor {{and not have to}} be transferred over the transmission lines. This practice alone does not save energy in a direct way, because <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> does no work. But because the reactive component of the current is now only flowing locally, it is producing heat only in the local conductors and thus saving total energy.|$|E
25|$|Conventionally, {{capacitors}} {{are treated}} as if they generate <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> and inductors as if they consume it. If a capacitor and an inductor are placed in parallel, then the currents flowing through the capacitor and the inductor tend to cancel rather than add. This is the fundamental mechanism for controlling the power factor in electric power transmission; capacitors (or inductors) are inserted in a circuit to partially compensate for <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> 'consumed' by the load. Purely capacitive circuits supply <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> with the current waveform leading the voltage waveform by 90degrees, while purely inductive circuits absorb <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> with the current waveform lagging the voltage waveform by 90degrees. The result {{of this is that}} capacitive and inductive circuit elements tend to cancel each other out.|$|E
25|$|In the diagram, P is {{the active}} power, Q is the <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> (in this case positive), S is the complex {{power and the}} length of S is the {{apparent}} power. <b>Reactive</b> <b>power</b> does not do any work, so it is represented as the imaginary axis of the vector diagram. Active power does do work, so it is the real axis.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{the actual}} active and <b>reactive</b> <b>powers</b> of the {{improved}} VSynC-based VSC with Target 2 and 3 are shown as Fig.  12 c, d and e, f, respectively. Both the averaged active and <b>reactive</b> <b>powers</b> {{can follow the}} change of the power references. As {{can be seen in}} Fig.  12, the dynamic state power responses of the improved VSynC-based VSC with different control targets are almost the same and is similar with the conventional VSynC.|$|R

25|$|As {{the power}} factor decreases, {{the ratio of}} real power to {{apparent}} power also decreases, as the angle θ increases and <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> increases.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of using}} a set of {{switched}} capacitors, an unloaded synchronous motor can supply <b>reactive</b> <b>power.</b> The <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> drawn by the synchronous motor {{is a function of}} its field excitation. This is referred to as a synchronous condenser. It is started and connected to the electrical network. It operates at a leading power factor and puts vars onto the network as required to support a system's voltage or to maintain the system power factor at a specified level.|$|E
25|$|The ‘system gain’ is an {{important}} source of <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> in the above power balance equation, which is generated by the capacitative nature of the transmission network itself. By making decisive switching actions in the early morning before the demand increases, the system gain can be maximized early on, helping to secure the system for the whole day. To balance the equation some pre-fault reactive generator use will be required. Other sources of <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> that will also be used include shunt capacitors, shunt reactors, static VAR compensators and voltage control circuits.|$|E

25|$|When {{households}} are not charged for the <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> they consume {{there is almost}} no monetary incentive for them to install power factor correction equipment. This is generally the case today, as household electric meters do not measure apparent power but only real power. Adding power factor correction merely affects the <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> supplied or drawn and not real power, so utility costs are unaffected. However if there are high-resistance lines connected between the utility meter and a relatively high load then the power as measured by the meter can be reduced by a small amount with power factor correction. Any such savings are usually insignificant.|$|E
25|$|If {{a purely}} {{resistive}} load {{is connected to}} a power supply, current and voltage will change polarity in step, the power factor will be 1, and the electrical energy flows in a single direction across the network in each cycle. Inductive loads such as induction motors (any type of wound coil) consume <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> with current waveform lagging the voltage. Capacitive loads such as capacitor banks or buried cable generate <b>reactive</b> <b>power</b> with current phase leading the voltage. Both types of loads will absorb energy during part of the AC cycle, which is stored in the device's magnetic or electric field, only to return this energy back to the source {{during the rest of}} the cycle.|$|E
