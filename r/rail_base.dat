40|$|Measuring system Abstract. The {{precision}} machining of the <b>rail</b> <b>base</b> for high-speed Magnetically Levitated Trains (MAGLEV) is the precondition for laying the high-quality whole rail and accomplishing the integrative performance {{test of the}} train. A new method is advanced to improving the machining precision in this paper. The X and Y coordinates of the cross centers on the <b>rail</b> <b>base</b> for MAGLEV will be obtained through two raster displacement sensors which are perpendicular to each other. So the machining datum position of the rail will be determined. According to the spatial position relationship between the straight movement error of the guideway on the numerical control machine tools and the central line of the <b>rail</b> <b>base</b> for MAGLEV, error compensation {{will be made to}} improve the machining precision in the process of the numerical control machining. The mechanism design theory of the measuring system is presented in this paper. On basis of both the design theory and the software platform of LabWindows/CVI, the virtual measurement system for measuring straight movement error of the rail on the numerical control machine tool, which is used to machining the <b>rail</b> <b>base</b> for MAGLEV will be established...|$|E

A noncontact and remote hybrid ultrasonic technique has been developed by combining laser generation with air coupled detection of ultrasonic signals in rails.

The device greatly minimizes some particle sizing errors inherent in current analyzers.

An existing five lens optical train was modified to allow each lens to be adjusted in three planes and then mounted on a rigid twin <b>rail</b> <b>base</b> to alleviate alignment problems. A precision linear positioning motor was installed to drive a zoom lens that adjusts the system focal length from 1850 mm to 5550 mm.

An analog computer interface has been built into the system to provide the device with automatic and manual control. During normal automatic operation the computer drives the zoom lens until an optimum intensity ratio is sensed. The system focal length is then determined which yields the corresponding particle size. Successful operation during initial testing has been achieved. Future refinements are suggested.

The current governments of Bogotá and Colombia have promised to begin the construction of the first line of the metro in the following years. Bogotá and London are two cities with similar characteristics such as population, area, density and type of soil; furthermore both cities are in the process of building a new mass transport system; in Bogotá the first line of the metro and in London Crossrail. London is a pioneer city in railways and metro systems in the world and has experience on the economic appraisal of this type of projects. In this dissertation we will use this experience to elaborate a Cost and Benefit Analysis model for the Bogotá metro. Cost and Benefit Analysis models are a common tool for the appraisal of transport and infrastructure project around the world and particularly in the UK. We have elaborated an appraisal tool for the decision makers of Colombia that involves the more important technical, social and economical aspects of the Bogotá metro project.
