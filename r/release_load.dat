40|$|Ten {{subjects}} {{performed a}} horizontal pulling task with sudden release for three randomly allocated loads of 20, 40, and 60 N {{to examine the}} effect of sudden <b>release</b> <b>load</b> on centre of pressure (COP) motion and the response strategy with respect to load, and also to determine critical loads at which the response strategy must involve stepping to prevent a fall. Sudden release produces COP deflection directed posteriorly and laterally towards the anteroposterior midline. The magnitude of these deflections increase with <b>release</b> <b>load</b> (P< 0. 001), as does the time taken to re-establish normal stance following release (P< 0. 001). Interaction between lateral and anteroposterior shifts in the COP are seen following release, and establishing COP over a favoured limb may be an important factor in the response strategy. This may be so, because if the perturbation is large enough to provoke a protective step, then the COP will have to be located towards one limb before the step can take place. Linear regression of the anteroposterior limit of the COP indicates a wide range of critical loads that will result in a necessary preventive step backwards being taken (80 - 257 N, mean 153 N), although these values are likely to be overestimated somewhat.

40|$|Work {{flows in}} a job-shop are {{determined}} {{not only by}} the <b>release</b> <b>load</b> and the time between release factors, but also by the number of accepted orders. There has been extensive research on workload and input-output control aiming at improving the performance of manufacturing operations in job-shops. This paper explores the idea of controlling the workload since the acceptance/rejection of orders stage. A new acceptance/rejection rule is proposed, and tests are conducted to study the sensitivity of job-shop performance to different order acceptance parameters, like the tolerance of the workload limit and the due date extension acceptance. It also evaluates the effect of the negotiation phase of the proposed acceptance rule on the job-shop performance using a simulation model of a generic random job-shop. The extensive simulation experiments allow us to conclude that having a negotiation phase prior to rejection improves almost all workload performance measures. We also conclude that different tolerances of the workload limit affect slightly the performance of the job-shop. job shop, order negotiation, workload control...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: Sudden {{release of}} load during lifting threatens {{postural}} stability and is countered by trunk muscle response, which can generate high loads on the spine, {{and may be}} a cause of tissue injury. The postural threat following sudden release and the consequent muscular response are likely {{to depend on the}} posture at the time of release. This study investigates the effects of sudden release of load at two release heights of one- and three-quarters of the knee to shoulder distance during stoop lifting. Methods: Ten normal southern Chinese male volunteers were subject to sudden release of 20, 40, 60 and 80 N loads during stoop lifting trials. The release was randomly selected to be on the third, fourth or fifth cycle of a trial and was triggered at heights of one- and three-quarters of the total knee to shoulder lifting distance. The subjects stood on a force platform to allow the postural disturbance to be recorded by monitoring the center of pressure (COP), and electromyographic (EMG) data were collected from the rectus abdominus, internal oblique, external oblique, erector spinae and latissimus dorsi muscle groups. Results: The COP excursion moved closer to the posterior limit of stability with increasing <b>release</b> <b>load,</b> and this effect was significantly more marked for release from the lower of the two heights. The minimum posterior COP separation from the posterior limit of stability was significantly less for the lower release height at all loads (p< 0. 001 in all cases). EMG data showed that the agonist–antagonist co-contraction durations were higher for the lower release height, and unlike sudden release from the higher level, showed a significant increase with increasing load. Conclusions: Sudden release at lower release height during stoop lifting results in significantly greater postural disturbance and spinal loading. The mean load predicted to result in fall or stumble at the lower release height (133 N) is significantly less than that predicted at the higher of the two release heights (245 N). A more marked effect of <b>release</b> <b>load</b> is also seen in the postural disturbance and trunk muscle co-contraction time for the lower release height, and particular care should therefore be taken when handling potentially unstable loads under these conditions. If the security of the load cannot be guaranteed, storage at a higher level may reduce the risk of injury due to sudden release of the load. Department of Health Technology and Informatic...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to reevaluate and improve the existing cable-to-post attachment hardware that is utilized in the non-proprietary cable barrier being developed at MwRSF. The study focused on redesigning the bolted, tabbed bracket (V 10) to eliminate the bolt, reduce the number of components per bracket, eliminate the need for tools during installation, and reduce the number of small parts. Three attachment concepts were selected for evaluation through dynamic testing: (1) the key plate attachment; (2) the wire lock pin attachment; and (3) the pinned back attachment. Each attachment prototype was subjected to two vertical and two lateral dynamic component tests to evaluate the <b>release</b> <b>loads</b> and fracture mechanisms of the brackets. Test results were compared to previous tests on the bolted tabbed bracket (V 10). None of the three bracket attachment designs were found to satisfy all of the design criteria for an alternative bracket. The lack of fixity in the connection between the brackets and the post led to a variable position of the tabs within the keyway which frequently caused unsatisfactory <b>release</b> <b>loads.</b> Therefore, none of the three alternative attachment brackets were recommended for use within the prototype non-proprietary cable barrier...|$|R

40|$|Gantry Cranes {{are common}} {{industrial}} structures {{that are used}} in building construction, factories, and harbors. These cranes are usually operated manually. With the size of these cranes becoming larger and the motion expected to be faster, the process of controlling them became difficult without using automatic control methods. In general, the movement of cranes has no prescribed path. Cranes have to be run under different operating conditions, which makes closed-loop control preferable. The aim of this project is to develop a controller to reduce the sway angle of the rope for a two dimensional gantry crane system. The 2 D-gantry crane system consists of a cart, rope, payload, actuator as well as controller. In this project, the control technique to be implemented to control the sway angle of the rope is Delayed Feedback Signal (DFS). In DFS, the control signal is calculated based on delayed position feedback. The performance on system in 2 D-gantry crane focused on the sway angle of the hoisting rope and its corresponding Power Spectral Density (PSD) on the sway angle response. Finally, the comparative assessment {{of the effects of the}} system using DFS controller is tested by using different values of the parameters such as mass of the load, length of the rode and the initial point of <b>release</b> <b>load...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{proposal}} {{is for the}} development of an automated clutch release measurement device for Tilton Engineering, Inc. Tilton has expressed its desire for a piece of test equipment to supplement their existing CT 2000 clutch clamp load testing machine. This device will acquire r el e as e load and travel data for the pressure plate of a clutch immediately after it is tested for clamp load on the CT 2000 machine, and will serve as a quality control check for Tilton’s clutches before they are sent out to the customer. Tilton wants a clutch release test machine to ensure that their assembly and manufacturing processes are meeting their engineering specifications. They will also be able to gather more data during R 2 ̆ 6 D which will help with the creation of better quality products. Currently Tilton does not have an accurate method of measuring c l u t c h <b>release</b> <b>load</b> and travel for their rebuilt clutches. This would be a useful verification to ensure that the clutch has been rebuilt to specification. Being able to pass this information on to the customer would also provide an extra level of verification and data. This machine will do the following for Tilton: 1. Help the customer select the best Tilton clutch for their requirements and their needs. 2. Verify that their clutch has been rebuilt to their satisfaction as well as Tilton’s specifications. 3. Verify that the release force of the rebuilt clutch is the same (or similar) to a brand new unit. 4. Allow Tilton Engineering to accurately measure and document the release loads for all clutches in the product line. This will allow Tilton to publish this data for customers that may need it and to establish upper and lower levels of what will be acceptable for quality control. 5. Provide <b>release</b> <b>load</b> data to the customer for their specific new and/or rebuilt clutch assemblies. 6. Support new research and development of new components and assemblies to augment the product line. 7. Provide a new tool for returned goods evaluation and failure analysis.

40|$|The {{research}} objectives reported herein {{were based}} on further development of cable-to-post attachment hardware {{for use in the}} non-proprietary high-tension cable barrier system. Specifically, this project aimed to develop and evaluate alternative attachment designs for the bolted, tabbed bracket and evaluate the use of a larger diameter, keeper rod for use in the top cable attachment. From a group of over 25 alternative attachment concepts, two tabbed bracket designs were selected for evaluation through dynamic component testing: 1) the lateral shear plate attachment and 2) the drop-in shear plate attachment. The drop-in shear plate concept did not perform as intended, as the vertical <b>release</b> <b>load</b> was too high and the lateral release loads were too low. Alternatively, the lateral shear plate design provided vertical and lateral release loads very similar to the original bolted, tabbed bracket V 10. However, concerns were raised over the lack of rigidity in the attachment and the ease of installations of the shear plate. Thus, it was recommended that the lateral shear plate design be modified and reevaluated prior to use in the full-scale system. Dynamic bogie or component testing of the 3 / 16 -in. (4. 8 -mm) diameter brass keeper rod provided a quick cable release similar to the previous design. The increased strength of the rod also showed promise in distributing impact loads more uniformly to adjacent posts and helping reduce system deflections. Thus, the 3 / 16 -in. (4. 8 -mm) diameter brass rod was recommended for use in the new high-tension cable barrier system...|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} properties of calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) {{are very similar}} to the mineral phase of bone. CPCs are, consequently, very effective substrates (scaffolds) for tissue engineering; bone and stem cells attach readily, and can proliferate and differentiate to form new bone tissue. Unlike other CPCs that may remain largely unchanged in the body for years, such as hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphates are remodelled by the body and rapidly converted to new bone. Unfortunately, the dicalcium phosphates are also typically too weak to support load bearing in the human body. Our laboratory has recently developed a novel, high strength brushite CPC, (hsCPC), which can reach 10 - 50 fold higher failure strength than many commercially available CPCs. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the physical, chemical and biological performance of hsCPCs in physiologically relevant model of drug <b>release,</b> <b>load</b> bearing, osteoconductivity, and as a scaffold for bone tissue engineering. Multiple CPCs were compared in a model of screw augmentation to determine whether the physical properties of the cement, such as bulk strength and porosity, affected orthopedic screw holding strength. In an in vitro model of bone regeneration stem cells were grown on macroporous scaffolds that were fabricated from hsCPC. Drug releasing scaffolds were fabricated to examine whether the low porosity of hsCPC impeded drug release during a 4 week incubation period. The biological activity of an incorporated drug, Rebamipide, was examined after acute and chronic incubation periods. In the drug release study it was noted that the biological response to hsCPC was significantly better than tissue culture grade polystyrene, even in groups without drug. The mechanism underlying this biological response was further investigated by testing the effect of pyrophosphate, a common cement additive, on bone cell proliferation and differentiation. This thesis concludes that a high strength cement can produce significant improvement in screw augmentation strength, if there is sufficient cortical bone near the augmentation site. The hsCPC is also cytocompatible, and can support bone and stem cell proliferation and differentiation. hsCPC scaffolds stimulated osteogenic gene expression comparable to native bone scaffolds. hsCPC scaffolds are also capable of delivering drug for up to 4 weeks, in vitro. Finally, a cement additive, pyrophosphate, stimulated differentiation, but not proliferation of bone cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} fatigue on the muscular and {{postural}} response to sudden release of different stoop lifting loads was studied. Ten male volunteers performed {{a series of}} stoop lifting trials before and after fatigue of the erector spinae. Trials were performed using loads of 20, 40, 60, and 80 N, and sudden release of load was triggered randomly {{on one of the}} repetitions using an electromagnetic release. The onset of release was registered by an accelerometer, centre of pressure (COP) motion was recorded via a forceplate, and EMG activities of the latissimus dorsi (LD), erector spinae (ES), rectus abdominus (RA), external oblique (EO) and internal oblique (IO) muscles were recorded. A slightly reduced lifting speed was seen after fatigue, particularly at the higher loads, but this had little effect on the perturbing force at release, which was dominated by the <b>release</b> <b>load.</b> A significant effect of fatigue was seen on the antero-posterior COP motion, with the postural disturbance being decreased after fatigue. Fatigue resulted in a significant increase in ES (p = 0. 029) and LD (p = 0. 015) relaxation times and, while the response patterns (relaxation, contraction or no response) of the anterior trunk muscles (RA, EO, IO) were not always consistent, the proportion of response by relaxation was greater after fatigue. This resulted in a lower incidence but longer duration of co-contraction of the ES-RA, ES-EO and ES-EO muscle groups following fatigue, such that the mean co-contraction duration of these groups showed no significant differences before and after fatigue. The response to sudden release is a balance between maintaining postural stability {{and at the same time}} preventing the trunk musculature from overloading the spine and risking tissue injury. While fatigue of the trunk extensors does not appear to increase either the risk of fall or stumble or the incidence of co-contraction following sudden release of stoop lifting tasks, the duration of co-contraction appears to increase following fatigue. Further study is required to quantify the loading on the spine during sudden release of different lifting tasks before and after more realistic fatigue conditions.

40|$|Power {{constraints}} {{led to the}} end of {{exponential growth}} in single–processor performance, which characterized the semiconductor industry for many years. Single–chip multiprocessors allowed the performance growth to continue so far. Yet, Amdahl’s law asserts that the overall performance of future single–chip multiprocessors will depend crucially on single–processor performance. In a multiprocessor a small growth in single–processor performance can justify the use of significant resources. Partitioning the layout of critical components can improve the energy–efficiency and ultimately the performance of a single processor. In a clustered microarchitecture parts of these components form clusters. Instructions are processed locally in the clusters and benefit from the smaller size and complexity of the clusters components. Because the clusters together process a single instruction stream communications between clusters are necessary and introduce an additional cost. This thesis proposes the design of a distributed memory unit and first level cache {{in the context of a}} clustered microarchitecture. While the partitioning of other parts of the microarchitecture has been well studied the distribution of the memory unit and the cache has received comparatively little attention. The first proposal consists of a set of cache bank predictors. Eight different predictor designs are compared based on cost and accuracy. The second proposal is the distributed memory unit. The load and store queues are split into smaller queues for distributed disambiguation. The mapping of memory instructions to cache banks is delayed until addresses have been calculated. We show how disambiguation can be implemented efficiently with unordered queues. A bank predictor is used to map instructions that consume memory data near the data origin. We show that this organization significantly reduces both energy usage and latency. The third proposal introduces Dispatch Throttling and Pre-Access Queues. These mechanisms avoid load/store queue overflows that are a result of the late allocation of entries. The fourth proposal introduces Memory Issue Queues, which add functionality to select instructions for execution and re-execution to the memory unit. The fifth proposal introduces Conservative Deadlock Aware Entry Allocation. This mechanism is a deadlock safe issue policy for the Memory Issue Queues. Deadlocks can result from certain queue allocations because entries are allocated out-of-order instead of in-order like in traditional architectures. The sixth proposal is the Early Release of Load Queue Entries. Architectures with weak memory ordering such as Alpha, PowerPC or ARMv 7 can take advantage of this mechanism to <b>release</b> <b>load</b> queue entries before the commit stage. Together, these proposals allow significantly smaller and more energy efficient load queues without the need of energy hungry recovery mechanisms and without performance penalties. Finally, we present a detailed study that compares the proposed distributed memory unit to a centralized memory unit and confirms its advantages of reduced energy usage and of improved performance.
