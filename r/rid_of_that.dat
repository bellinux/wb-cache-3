I wanted to dispel that and get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E

2500|$|Charlie Bachman, in {{his first}} game as Michigan State's head coach, used a passing game to attempt a comeback. [...] The Spartans {{completed}} five of 18 passes for 74 yards. [...] The Wolverines completed one of four passes. [...] After the game, Bachman told reporters: [...] "I am pleased with the outcome of the game, despite the loss, because we got <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> inferiority complex with Michigan. [...] My two sophomore backs [...] [...] [...] played as if they never heard of Michigan. [...] To them, Michigan was just another football team." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Butler, Ward's drum solo [...] "Rat Salad" [...] {{resulted}} from the band having to play eight and three quarter hour spots a night in Europe early in their career. [...] "Bill used {{to fill out a}} whole 45 minutes doing a drum solo just to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> 45 minutes," [...] he revealed to Classic Albums. [...] "I have no idea where the title came from, though." [...] In 2013, Sabbath biographer Mick Wall described the closing track on the album, [...] "Fairies Wear Boots", as a [...] "hard-driving riff sweetened by a beautifully baleful melody" [...] with a lyric written by Osbourne about a nasty encounter with a group of skinheads.|$|E
2500|$|According to O'Brien {{a network}} {{executive}} told him, {{in regards to}} Andy Richter, he'd [...] "never succeed until I ‘got <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> big fat dildo.’ That was {{the tone of the}} conversations between us and the network." [...] It was widely expected that the host of Talk Soup, Greg Kinnear would take over the role, but Kinnear turned down the opportunity and decided to pursue a career in acting. Stars like Tom Hanks agreed to appear on Late Night, which boosted audience awareness. Even Letterman, who admired O’Brien’s comic sensibility, appeared as a guest to register his support. O'Brien's performance style improved through experience and he began to receive more favorable reviews and ratings the following year. With the ratings gradually improving over the course of two years, Late Night reached a new level of critical and commercial success in 1996. Tom Shales officially recanted his previous critical review with the headline [...] "I was wrong", and O'Brien received his first Emmy writing nomination, which he has gone on to receive every year since.|$|E

2500|$|Johnson became {{president}} upon {{the assassination of}} President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, and the goodwill generated by the incident gave him tremendous popularity. He enjoyed strong support against the bitterly divided Republicans; polls in January 1964 showed him leading Republican challengers Barry Goldwater 75% to 20% and Nelson Rockefeller 74% to 17%. However, Wallace had received over 100,000 letters and telegrams of support, nearly half from non-southerners, following his 1963 Stand in the Schoolhouse Door in defiance of {{a court order to}} integrate the University of Alabama, and he subsequently became [...] "Tennyson's Mordred, exposing the dark side of Camelot". He began a national speaking tour with a well-received lecture at Harvard on November 7, 1963, bringing him additional notoriety as he flirted {{with the idea of a}} national campaign. Wallace's charm and candor won over many of his critics; during a question and answer session at Harvard, a black man asserted his intention to run for president, to which Wallace smiled and responded, [...] "Between you and me both, we might get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> crowd in Washington. We might even run on the same ticket." [...] Meanwhile, Johnson forbade discussion of politics in the White House and refused to comment on whether he would run in the 1964 election, instead pursuing the late Kennedy's legislative agenda (most notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964), managing the Vietnam War, and declaring his own [...] "War on Poverty".|$|E
2500|$|Gerda and Henrietta enter. [...] Henrietta asks Gerda {{what she}} has done with the holster of the murder weapon, stating that {{if they can get}} <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> there will be no evidence, and no one will be convicted of the murder. [...] Gerda feigns ignorance, but Henrietta is persistent. [...] Gerda tells Henrietta that the cut up scraps are in her leatherworking bag, and confides that she {{witnessed}} John's infidelity with Veronica, and therefore had to kill him. [...] Henrietta goes offstage to get some tea to calm Gerda's frazzled nerves. [...] Gerda, thinking she is unobserved, takes a vial of poison from her purse, and pours some into Henrietta's drink. [...] Henrietta returned more quickly than Gerda expected, and witnesses this silently from just outside the room. [...] She enters, more noisily this time. [...] Vocalizing her decision to have tea with Gerda, rather than the sherry she had poured for herself, she leaves to get another teacup. [...] Gerda picks up a revolver, but Inspector Coulquouhoun enters and takes it from her. [...] Upon hearing that Veronica Craye will not be convicted of the murder (she somehow knows about the gun in Veronica's handbag), Gerda begins to go into a hysterical fit, calling for her deceased husband. [...] Inspector Colqouhoun unknowingly offers the poisoned drink to Gerda, who drinks it before she realises {{what she has}} done. [...] Henrietta returns, and explains the poisoned drink to Colquohoun, who reveals that he had deduced Gerda's guilt from her character. [...] Lucy enters, and the lights go down as the inspector calls the police station.|$|E
