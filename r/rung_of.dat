5|$|The present civil {{services}} of India is mainly {{based on the}} pattern of the former Indian Civil Service of British India. The civil services were divided into two categories - covenanted and uncovenanted. The covenanted civil service consisted of only Europeans (i.e., English personnel) occupying the higher posts in the government. The uncovenanted civil service was solely introduced to facilitate the entry of Indians at the lower <b>rung</b> <b>of</b> the administration.|$|E

On 14 April 1768, the imperial court announced the death of Ming Rui and the appointment of Fuheng as the new chief commander of the Burma campaign. Manchu generals, Agui, Aligun and Suhede were appointed as his deputies. Now, the top <b>rung</b> <b>of</b> the Qing military establishment prepared for a final showdown with the Burmese.|$|E

25|$|During the {{occupation}} of East India Company, Civil Service was divided into three categories - Covenanted, Uncovenanted and Special Civil Services. The covenanted civil service, or the Honourable East India Company's Civil Service (HEICCS), as it was called, largely consisted of British civil servants occupying the higher posts in the government. The uncovenanted civil service was solely introduced to facilitate the entry of Indians at the lower <b>rung</b> <b>of</b> the administration. The Special Service consisted of special departments of Indian Administration like Indian Forest Service, Indian Police, Indian Political Service etc. the ranks of these services were filled {{in a variety of}} ways, Indian Political Service officers generally came from the HEICCS/ICS and the British Indian Army, Indian Police had many British Indian Army officers in its ranks, but from 1893 onwards, a separate annual exam was conducted to fill its cadre.|$|E
25|$|Cattle {{ranching}} rapidly expanded, {{becoming the}} predominant land use; horsemanship and cattle ownership became {{the symbols of}} status, and the society developed quasi-feudal characteristics, in which the largest ranches were almost entirely self-sufficient. The Chumash who previously had served the padres in the Mission system became laborers on the ranches, occupying the lowest <b>rung</b> <b>of</b> the social ladder, with the oldest established families – the Ortegas, De la Guerras, and others – at the top. During this period the town of Santa Barbara grew into a modest, and informally organized collection of structures around the central Presidio. A few of these buildings – such as the Covarrubias adobe, {{on the grounds of}} the Santa Barbara Historical Society on Santa Barbara Street, which was briefly the location of the capitol of California during the Mexican War – survive to the present day. By the mid-1840s the Mexican period, the population of Santa Barbara had reached approximately 2,500.|$|E
500|$|In general, Mycenaean society {{appears to}} have been divided into two groups of free men: the king's entourage, who {{conducted}} administrative duties at the palace, and the people, [...] These last were watched over by royal agents and were obliged to perform duties for and pay taxes to the palace. Among those who could be found in the palace were well-to-do high officials, who probably lived in the vast residences found in proximity to Mycenaean palaces, but also others, tied by their work to the palace and not necessarily better off than the members of the da-mo, such as craftsmen, farmers, and perhaps merchants. Occupying a lower <b>rung</b> <b>of</b> the social ladder were the slaves, do-e-ro, (cf. , doúlos). These are recorded in the texts as working either for the palace or for specific deities.|$|E

500|$|Much {{is known}} about the {{subsequent}} career of the team's ex-manager. In 1909, Marty Hogan moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he signed future Hall of Fame pitcher Stan Coveleski to his first professional contract. In 1909, the Lancaster Red Roses worked up a 75-39 record, seizing the championship of the Tri-State League. As Spalding's Baseball Guide (1910) reported: [...] "Lancaster, under manager Marty Hogan, won its first pennant in the league, and the top <b>rung</b> <b>of</b> the ladder was only gained by the hardest kind of fighting". Hogan went on to manage clubs in Zanesville and Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. In 1913, during a stint in Zanesville, the manager signed pitcher Sam Jones to his first professional contract. In the mid-1910s, Hogan permanently resettled in Youngstown, where he died in 1923, several months after being injured in an automobile accident.|$|E
500|$|Physical {{effects were}} {{not an issue}} for the series regulars. Allison Mack {{performed}} her own stunts for the scene in [...] "Hothead" [...] where her character's office is set on fire, and again in [...] "Kinetic", when she was cabled off and dangled [...] above the ground. For [...] "Nicodemus", the stunt coordinator received twice the help. Kristin Kreuk was expected {{to go to the}} tenth <b>rung</b> <b>of</b> a water tower, in a scene which involved her character climbing to the top and falling off. As filming progressed, Kreuk climbed to the top, so the crew cabled her off and dropped her [...] to the bottom. John Schneider's experience from The Dukes of Hazzard led to him performing the stunt driving for his character. The scene required Schneider to slide his truck around a corner, while yelling at some pedestrians on the sidewalk. The previous scene had established the driver side window as closed, so Schneider improvised and opened the driver's door as he slid 90° around a corner.|$|E
500|$|... 2001: A Space Odyssey is now {{considered}} one of the major artistic works of the 20th century, with many critics and filmmakers considering it Kubrick's masterpiece. Director Martin Scorsese has listed it as one of his favourite films of all time. In the 1980s, critic David Denby compared Kubrick to the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey, calling him [...] "a force of supernatural intelligence, appearing at great intervals amid high-pitched shrieks, who gives the world a violent kick up the next <b>rung</b> <b>of</b> the evolutionary ladder". Poet and critic Dan Schneider wrote that 2001: A Space Odyssey [...] "has one of the greatest screenplays ever penned", countering accusations of the film's coldness by saying, [...] "I recall the HAL ‘death scene’ {{as one of the few}} filmic moments to ever cause me to tear up in sadness. [...] And, in the intervening years, I have, in film talks, found that the same scene caused the same emotional reaction in many other viewers. I was not alone. Any film that can both enhance one’s consciousness and touch one’s emotions, simultaneously, evinces greatness." ...|$|E

500|$|Relatively {{little is}} known of The Lady's Realms {{publishing}} history, as many records of its publisher, Hutchinson, were destroyed during the London Blitz. The first issue was published in November 1896. Its first editor was William Henry Wilkins, a mildly successful novelist who oversaw the publication's editing from 1896 to 1902. Though inexperienced, Wilkins was acquainted with society, being a friend of such figures as the explorer Richard Francis Burton and his wife Isabel Burton. After Wilkins' death in 1905, The Lady's Realm wrote of how [...] "the general public are little aware how much of [...] early success" [...] was due to him, and that [...] "not a few [...] have since made their names {{in the world of}} letters have to thank him for placing their foot on the first <b>rung</b> <b>of</b> the ladder". Wilkins' successor as editor is unknown, though Margaret Versteeg and colleagues, who produced an index of the fiction published in The Lady's Realm, detect no changes in editorial judgement in the magazine's tenure after 1902. While the publication mainly featured women writers and feminine topics, all of its editors, most likely, were men.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky began {{piano lessons}} at age five. Precocious, {{within three years}} he had become as adept at reading sheet music as his teacher. His parents, {{initially}} supportive, hired a tutor, bought an orchestrion (a form of barrel organ that could imitate elaborate orchestral effects), and encouraged his piano study for both aesthetic and practical reasons. However, they decided in 1850 to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. They had both graduated from institutes in Saint Petersburg and the School of Jurisprudence, which mainly served the lesser nobility, would prepare Tchaikovsky for {{a career as a}} civil servant. Regardless of talent, the only musical careers available in Russia at that time—except for the affluent aristocracy—were as a teacher in an academy or as an instrumentalist in one of the Imperial Theaters. Both were considered on the lowest <b>rung</b> <b>of</b> the social ladder, with individuals in them enjoying no more rights than peasants. His father's income was also growing increasingly uncertain, so both parents may have wanted Tchaikovsky to become independent as soon as possible. [...] As the minimum age for acceptance was 12 and Tchaikovsky was only 10 at the time, he was required to spend two years boarding at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school, [...] from his family. Once those two years had passed, Tchaikovsky transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, in 1909, Hogan {{relocated to}} Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he replaced local ball club manager Clarence [...] "Pop" [...] Foster, who had managed the Red Roses since 1907. [...] Once Hogan signed a contract, Foster {{moved on to}} lead another club in Trenton, New Jersey. [...] The Lancaster team's momentum escalated during the 1909 season, and in July of that year, Sporting Life reported that the Red Roses club was drawing positive attention. [...] "The fast pace at which the Lancaster bunch has been going lately has been {{the talk of the}} league", the paper stated. [...] "Marty Hogan was not given much consideration as a pennant aspirant when the season opened, but the plucky Red Roses manager has been 'sawing wood' and not talking". [...] Indeed, by the close of the 1909 season, the Lancaster Red Roses had worked up a 7539 record, seizing the championship of the Tri-State League. [...] As Spalding's Baseball Guide (1910) reported: [...] "Lancaster, under manager Marty Hogan, won its first pennant in the league, and the top <b>rung</b> <b>of</b> the ladder was only gained by the hardest kind of fighting". [...] Sporting Life indicated that Hogan was confident of the outcome early in the season. [...] "After his return from the first trip around the circuit", wrote reporter G. H. Hartley, [...] "Marty said to your correspondent that he saw nothing in the league that was better than his team". [...] Hartley noted that, on the closing day of the season, Hogan accepted the Farnsworth Cup, [...] "the Tri-State trophy", on behalf of his team. [...] "Between the first and second innings the [...] players presented Manager Marty Hogan with a beautiful silver set and a silver loving cup", he added. [...] The inscribed silver cup reportedly left Hogan [...] "so surprised that he was unable to respond". [...] On September 7, 1909, one day after the contest, the Reading Eagle stated, [...] "A great crowd witnessed the final game, in which Hogan's gallant band trimmed the Trenton wanderers". [...] The newspaper added, [...] "The real enthusiasm was awakened, however, by the floating of the championship pennant, awarded by a Phila. [...] paper". [...] A key participant in the team's successful performance was a young pitcher named Stan Coveleski, who went on to post a record of 53 wins and 38 losses during his three seasons with Lancaster. He made his professional debut with the Philadelphia Athletics three seasons later. [...] Indeed, the Ogden Standard had praised Hogan as a [...] "live wire" [...] back in February 1909, when he [...] "grabbed up the three brothers of Harry Coveleski of the Phillies, and had them all sign contracts". [...] Highlights of the season may have included an exhibition game with the Philadelphia Phillies, which was scheduled to be held in Lancaster on April 2, 1909.|$|E
