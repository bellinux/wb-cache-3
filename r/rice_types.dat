5000|$|For most of {{the period}} of Portuguese involvement, the people of Portuguese Guinea were {{subsistence}} farmers. In the 19th century, the coastal Balanta people, who were outside Portuguese control, had developed a sophisticated agricultural system, growing paddy-rice in reclaimed coastal swamps.

The Balanta also participated in the slave trade in this period. [...] Another crop developed in this period was peanuts, and exports from Portuguese Guinea began in the mid 19th century.

30|$|Based on {{the results}} of {{descriptive}} statistics and multivariate analyses, it can be concluded that the As content in rice does not significantly differ among climatic zones and <b>rice</b> <b>types</b> while Se differs among <b>rice</b> <b>types.</b> However Cd content in rice differs drastically according to rice type and climate zone. The elevated levels of toxic elements, Cd and As in rice suggests that paddy soils have been subject to a high input of anthropogenic contaminants that are most likely related to the agrogenic activities such as application of fertilizer used to improve production and quality since the geogenic input is not considerable in Sri Lanka. Interestingly, native rice varieties contained significantly higher content of Se which is an essential trace element that is considered as being deficient among Sri Lankan population. Since the Se intake among Sri Lankans seems to be low and critical while the main staple food does not supply adequate amounts, assessing the Glutathione peroxidase in blood in the population is highly warranted. It is also important to adopt regulations to control the agrogenic trace metal inputs.|$|E

There was an increase in temporal CO 2 production with wetter and warmer conditions in naturally contaminated rice.

From both <b>rice</b> <b>types,</b> 15 (83. 3 %) of 18 A. flavus isolates produced detectable levels of AFB 1 in a range 2. 5 – 1979. 6 μg/kg. There was an increase in DML in both <b>rice</b> <b>types</b> inoculated with A. flavus as temperature and aw were increased. Interestingly very little AFB 1 was detected in paddy rice, but significant contamination occurred in the brown rice. The %DML in the control and A. flavus inoculated rice increased with temperature and aw at both 25 and 30 °C from 1 - 2 % to 15 – 20 % DML at 30 °C and 0. 95 aw. All the inoculated rice samples had AFB 1 levels above the EU legislative limits for contamination in other temperate cereals and products derived from cereals (= 2 μg/kg). Even samples with % DML as low as 0. 2 % had AFB 1 contamination levels twice the limits for other cereals. These results suggest that the mycotoxin contamination risk in staple commodities like rice, is influenced by whether the rice is processed or not, and that measurement of R rates can be used to predict the relative risk of AFB 1 contamination in such staple commodities...|$|E

40|$|A novel way {{of cooking}} rice to {{maximize}} {{the removal of the}} carcinogen inorganic arsenic (Asi) is presented here. In conventional rice cooking water and grain are in continuous contact, and it is known that the larger the water:rice cooking ratio, the more Asi removed by cooking, suggesting that the Asi in the grain is mobile in water. Experiments were designed where rice is cooked in a continual stream of percolating near boiling water, either low in Asi, or Asi free. This has the advantage of not only exposing grain to large volumes of cooking water, but also physically removes any Asi leached from the grain into the water receiving vessel. The relationship between cooking water volume and Asi removal in conventional rice cooking was demonstrated for the <b>rice</b> <b>types</b> under study. At a water-to-rice cooking ratio of 12 : 1, 57 ± 5 % of Asi could be removed, average of 6 wholegrain and 6 polished rice samples. Two types of percolating technology were tested, one where the cooking water was recycled through condensing boiling water steam and passing the freshly distilled hot water through the grain in a laboratory setting, and one where tap water was used to cook the rice held in an off-the-shelf coffee percolator in a domestic setting. Both approaches proved highly effective in removing Asi from the cooking rice, with up to 85 % of Asi removed from individual <b>rice</b> <b>types.</b> For the recycled water experiment 59 ± 8 % and 69 ± 10 % of Asi was removed, on average, compared to uncooked rice for polished (n= 27) and wholegrain (n= 13) rice, respectively.
