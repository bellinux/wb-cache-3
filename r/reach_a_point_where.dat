It launched a story arc about bullying, which Glee co-creator Ryan Murphy had been building to for a season and a half. He explained that he wanted Kurt to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> he would not accept the abusive treatment he received any more, and planned to follow the developments {{through the rest of}} the year, as all of the other characters were affected. The revelation that Karofsky's antagonism stemmed from his own homosexual feelings was based on a personal acquaintance of Murphy's. After the episode had been written, a spate of suicides occurred around the nation among teenage victims of bullying, which Murphy said added extra significance to [...] "Never Been Kissed" [...] and [...] "ignite the cast and the crew to do their best and push themselves with the story." ...|$|E

Olivier Van Doorne, worldwide creative director at Select Communications, said: [...] "Whenever you take a celebrity into a commercial venture, which {{more and more people are}} doing, there's enormous risk [...] It doesn't take much to turn the public around overnight." [...] Mark Malinowski, director for entertainment marketing at Ketchum, part of the Omnicom, said the situation [...] "will <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where,</b> like anything else, there may be overexposure". Lancaster's marketing vice president Catherine Walsh remarked in a statement: [...] "The worst thing in the world would be to unplug Glow to introduce Still". Still Jennifer Lopez was released in October 2003. While Glow by JLo was aimed at the female market at girls between the age of 15 and 25, Still Jennifer Lopez was aimed to appeal to an older demographic of females 25 and above, according to Rebecca Murray of About.com.|$|E

500|$|Since Quinn and Basehart did {{not speak}} Italian, both were dubbed in the {{original}} release. [...] Unhappy with the actor who initially dubbed Zampanò, Fellini remembered being impressed by the work done by Arnoldo Foà in dubbing the Toshiro Mifune character in the Italian version of Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, {{and was able to}} secure Foà's services at the very last moment. [...] Composer Michel Chion has observed that Fellini particularly exploited the tendency of Italian films of the post-war period to allow considerable freedom in the synching of voices to lip movements, especially in contrast to Hollywood's perceived [...] "obsessive fixation" [...] with the matching of voices to mouths: [...] "In Fellinian extremes, when all those post-synched voices float around bodies, we <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> voices--even if we continue to attribute them to the bodies they're assigned--begin to acquire a sort of autonomy, in a baroque and decentered fashion."

I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Until you <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the pornography only goes so far ... where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it." [...] Violence in the media, he said, [...] "particularly sexualized violence", sent boys [...] "down the road to being Ted Bundys." [...] The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave. [...] "You are going to kill me," [...] he said, [...] "and that will protect society from me. But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that." ...|$|E

In Population Bomb, Ehrlich suggests that [...] "there is no rational choice except to adopt some form of the Paddocks' strategy as far as food distribution is concerned." [...] Had this strategy been implemented for countries such as India and Egypt, which were reliant on food aid at that time, they would almost certainly have suffered famines. Instead, both Egypt and India have greatly increased their food production and now feed much larger populations without reliance on food aid.|$|E
2500|$|Voldemort {{appears at}} {{the climax of the}} fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, having again plotted against Harry. In this book, Harry goes through extreme {{emotional}} stress, and according to Rowling, it was necessary to prove that Harry is emotionally vulnerable and thus human, in contrast to his nemesis Voldemort, who is emotionally invulnerable and thus inhuman: [...] " [...] a very human hero, and this is, obviously, there’s a contrast, between him, as a very human hero, and Voldemort, who has deliberately dehumanised himself. [...] and Harry, therefore, did have to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> he did almost break down." [...] In this book, Voldemort makes liberal use of the Ministry of Magic's refusal to believe that he has returned. Voldemort engineers a plot to free Bellatrix Lestrange and other Death Eaters from Azkaban and then embarks on a scheme to retrieve the full record of a prophecy stored in the Department of Mysteries regarding Harry and himself. He sends a group of Death Eaters to retrieve the prophecy, where the Order of the Phoenix meets them. All but Bellatrix are captured, and Voldemort engages in a ferocious duel with Dumbledore. When Dumbledore gets the upper hand, Voldemort attempts to possess Harry but finds that he cannot; Harry is too full of that which Voldemort finds incomprehensible, and which he detests as weakness: love. Sensing that Dumbledore could win, Voldemort disapparates, but not before the Minister for Magic sees him in person, making his return to life public knowledge in the next book.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{an offer}} is made, {{the general rule}} is the offeree must {{communicate}} her acceptance {{in order to have}} a binding agreement. Notification of acceptance must actually <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the offeror could reasonably be expected to know, although if the recipient is at fault, for instance, by not putting enough ink in their fax machine for a message arriving in office hours to be printed, the recipient will still be bound. This goes for all methods of communication, whether oral, by phone, through telex, fax or email, except for the post. Acceptance by letter takes place when the letter is put in the postbox. The postal exception is a product of history, and does not exist in most countries. It only exists in English law so long as it is reasonable to use the post for a reply (e.g. not in response to an email), and its operation would not create manifest inconvenience and absurdity (e.g. the letter goes missing). In all cases it is possible for the negotiating parties to stipulate a prescribed mode of acceptance. It is not possible for an offeror to impose an obligation on the offeree to reject the offer without her consent. However, it is clear that people can accept through silence, firstly, by demonstrating through their conduct that they accept. In Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Company, although the Metropolitan Railway Company had never returned a letter from Mr Brogden formalising a long term supply arrangement for Mr Brogden's coal, they had conducted themselves for two years as if it were in effect, and Mr Brogden was bound. Secondly, the offeror may waive the need for communication of acceptance, either expressly, or implicitly, as in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company. Here a quack medicine company advertised its [...] "smoke ball", stating that if a customer found it did not cure them of the flu after using it thrice daily for two weeks, they would get £100. After noting the advertisement was serious enough to be an offer, not mere puff or an invitation to treat, the Court of Appeal held the accepting party only needed to use the smokeball as prescribed to get the £100. Although the general rule was to require communication of acceptance, the advertisement had tacitly waived the need for Mrs Carlill, or anyone else, to report her acceptance first. In other cases, such as where a reward is advertised for information, the only requirement of the English courts appears to be knowledge of the offer. Where someone makes such a unilateral offer, they fall under a duty to not revoke it once someone has begun to act on the offer. Otherwise an offer may always be revoked before it is accepted. The general rule is that revocation must be communicated, even if by post, although if the offerree hears about the withdrawal from a third party, this is as good as a withdrawal from the offeror himself. Finally, an offer can be [...] "killed off" [...] if, rather than a mere inquiry for information, someone makes a counter offer. So in Hyde v Wrench, when Wrench offered to sell his farm for £1000, and Hyde replied that he would buy it for £950 and Wrench refused, Hyde could not then change his mind and accept the original £1000 offer.|$|E
