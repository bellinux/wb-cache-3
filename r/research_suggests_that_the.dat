5|$|The new <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rocky centres of super-Earths are {{unlikely}} to evolve into terrestrial rocky planets like the inner planets of our Solar System because they appear {{to hold on to}} their large atmospheres. Rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of rock with a thin atmosphere, the small rocky core remains engulfed by its large hydrogen-rich envelope.|$|E

5000|$|In criticisms {{published}} in the British Medical Journal, both Jane Cassidy and David Colquhoun criticise Lewith, claiming that he prescribes homoeopathy despite having written papers that conclude it doesn’t work. Lewith has conducted <b>research</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> homeopathic remedy has no effect, [...] and other <b>research</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that,</b> while <b>the</b> homeopathic medicine itself {{does not appear to}} have an effect, the homeopathic consultation has a clinically relevant non-specific effect.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} North Korean forces {{committed}} to the region is not known, however later <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> North Korean 6th Division committed at least a battalion to the fight, {{and it is likely}} that an entire regiment was ordered to advance on the Notch and Masan. This would put the range of North Korean forces involved in the battle between 500 and 2,000.|$|E
5|$|However, later <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> initial {{stability}} of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than {{a certain period of}} healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Some <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> specific {{variant of the virus}} had an unusually aggressive nature. One group of researchers recovered the original virus from the bodies of frozen victims, and found that transfection in animals caused a rapid progressive respiratory failure and death through a cytokine storm (overreaction of the body's immune system). It was then postulated that the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{there has}} been <b>research</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> common raven is {{involved}} in seed dispersal. In the wild, the common raven chooses the best habitat and disperses seeds in locations best suited for its survival.|$|R

5000|$|Tai Mei Tuk means [...] "the very end" [...] in the Cantonese {{language}} which {{depicts the}} landscape. The homonym character [...] (tuk) is borrowed for the name. Recent Cantonese <b>research</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> correct character is [...]|$|R
5|$|Current <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{rates of}} self-harm {{are much higher}} among young people with {{the average age of}} onset between 14 and 24. The {{earliest}} reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm in young people could be as high as 33%. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching oneself, and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E
5|$|Europa orbits Jupiter in {{just over}} {{three and a half}} days, with an orbital radius of about 670,900km. With an {{eccentricity}} of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the orbital inclination relative to Jupiter's equatorial plane is small, at 0.470°. Like its fellow Galilean satellites, Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one hemisphere of Europa constantly facing Jupiter. Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Europa's surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead. Europa's prime meridian is the line intersecting this point. <b>Research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tidal locking may not be full, as a non-synchronous rotation has been proposed: Europa spins faster than it orbits, or at least did so in the past. This suggests an asymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates the icy crust from the rocky interior.|$|E

50|$|<b>Research</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{fundamental}} mechanism at {{the basis}} of the experiential understanding of others’ actions is the activation of the mirror neuron system.
