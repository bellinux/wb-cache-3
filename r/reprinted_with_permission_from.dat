40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} electronic transport through single-molecule junctions incorporating a Pt 6 metal cluster bound within an organic framework. We show that the insertion of this molecule between a pair of electrodes leads to a fully atomically engineered nano-metallic device with high conductance at the Fermi level and two sequential high on/off switching states. The origin of this property {{can be traced back}} to the existence of a HOMO which consists of two degenerate and asymmetric orbitals, lying close in energy to the Fermi level of the metallic leads. Their degeneracy is broken when the molecule is contacted to the leads, giving rise to two resonances which become pinned close to the Fermi level and display destructive interference.

40|$|The forming and melting of {{complementary}} base pairs in RNA duplexes are conformational transitions {{required to}} accomplish a plethora of biological functions. Yet the dynamic steps of these transitions have not been quantitatively characterized at the molecular level. In this work, the base opening process was first enforced by atomistic pulling simulations and then analyzed with a novel reweighting scheme which allowed the free-energy profile along any suitable reaction coordinate, e. g. solvation, to be reconstructed. The systematic application of such approach to different base-pair combinations provides a molecular motion picture of helix opening which is validated by comparison with an extensive set of experimental observations and links them to the enzyme-dependent unwinding mechanism. The RNA intrinsic dynamics disclosed in this work could rationalize the directionality observed in RNA-processing molecular machineries.

40|$|Hemoglobin {{exhibits}} allosteric {{structural changes}} upon ligand binding {{due to the}} dynamic interactions between the ligand binding sites, the amino acids residues and some other solutes present under physiological conditions. In the present study, the dynamical and quaternary structural changes occurring in two unligated (deoxy-) T structures, and two fully ligated (oxy-) R, R 2 structures of adult human hemoglobin were investigated with molecular dynamics. It is shown that, in the sub-microsecond time scale, there is no marked difference in the global dynamics of the amino acids residues in both the oxy- and the deoxy- forms of the individual structures. In addition, the R, R 2 are relatively stable and do not present quaternary conformational changes within the time scale of our simulations while the T structure is dynamically more flexible and exhibited the T→ R quaternary conformational transition, which is propagated by the relative rotation of the residues at the α 1 β 2 and α 2 β 1 interface.

40|$|RNA/protein {{interactions}} play crucial {{roles in}} controlling gene expression. They are becoming important targets for pharmaceutical applications. Due to RNA flexibility {{and to the}} strength of electrostatic interactions, standard docking methods are insufficient. We here present a computational method which allows studying the binding of RNA molecules and charged peptides with atomistic, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics. In our method, a suitable estimate of the electrostatic interaction is used as an order parameter (collective variable) which is then accelerated using bi-directional pulling simulations. Since the electrostatic interaction is only used to enhance the sampling, the approximations used to compute it do not affect the final accuracy. The method is employed to characterize the binding of TAR RNA from HIV- 1 and a small cyclic peptide. Our simulation protocol allows blindly predicting the binding pocket and pose as well as the binding affinity. The method is general and could be applied to study other electrostatics-driven binding events. Comment: <b>Reprinted</b> (adapted) <b>with</b> <b>permission</b> <b>from</b> J. Chem.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the high-speed mechanical micromilling process is described in this chapter. The present work not only compares computational approaches to the solution of shear plane and tool face temperatures, but also explains why {{there is a difference}} when calculating temperatures generated during the micromachining process. The analysis shows that the computed temperature of the shear plane never exceeds 35 Â°C when micromilling at spindle speeds approximately 310, 000 rpm. Machining AISI 1040 steel at significantly high speeds presents significant challenges to prevent the accelerated wear of the cutting tool that is caused by the frictional interactions between chip and tool {{and the nature of the}} intermittent contact. The analysis also shows the effect of coating at reducing the interface temperatures between chip and tool, and concludes that each coating has very little effect at reducing temperature at the tool face and at the primary shear zone. The results shown here are reported in Ref. 11. <b>Reprinted</b> <b>with</b> kind <b>permission</b> <b>from</b> Springer Science + Business Media B. V. Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|This thesis {{included}} five essays {{studying the}} performance of local governments in Norway. Four of the essays address variation in resource allocation and efficiency between the local governments, the fifth analyses variation in service level. The thesis has mainly an empirical orientation. One essay, presented in Chapter 4, provides a theoretical contribution {{to the study of}} efficiency variation in public sector service production. The empirical analyses concentrate on two spending components local government administration and long-term care. Chapter 2 and 3 study variation in the size of local government administration. Administration is a necessary input in both service provision and in the political decision-making process, and administrative spending competes with the welfare services for resources. The size of the administrative component determines the amount of resources available for the production of welfare services. Cost efficiency and service level within long-term care are the topics of Chapter 5 and 6 respectively. Long-tem care for elderly and disabled persons is, besides primary education, the major expenditure component of the municipalities.

40|$|Recent {{computational}} {{efforts have}} shown that the current potential energy models used in molecular dynamics are not accurate enough to describe the conformational ensemble of RNA oligomers and suggest that molecular dynamics should be complemented with experimental data. We here propose a scheme based on the maximum entropy principle to combine simulations with bulk experiments. In the proposed scheme the noise arising from both the measurements and the forward models used to back calculate the experimental observables is explicitly taken into account. The method is tested on RNA nucleosides and is then used to construct chemically consistent corrections to the Amber RNA force field that allow a large set of experimental data on nucleosides and dinucleosides to be correctly reproduced. The transferability of these corrections is assessed against independent data on tetranucleotides and displays a previously unreported agreement with experiments. This procedure can be applied to enforce multiple experimental data on multiple systems in a self-consistent framework thus suggesting a new paradigm for force field refinement.

The protonated species are stored in a cryogenically cooled Paul trap, maintained at ~ 10 K, and the parent and all the photo-fragment ions are mass-analyzed in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, which allows detecting the ionic species with an improved mass resolution compared to what is routinely achieved with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. These new results emphasize the competition around the band origin between two proton transfer reactions from the ammonium group toward either the aromatic chromophore or the carboxylic acid group. These reactions are initiated by the coupling of the locally excited ππ* state with higher charge transfer states, the positions and coupling of which depend on the conformation of the protonated molecules. Each of these reaction processes gives rise to specific fragmentation channels that supports the conformer selectivity observed in the photofragmentation spectra of protonated Tyrosine and Phenylalanine...|$|R
40|$|Can ritual form be {{predicted}} from knowledge of religious beliefs? E. Thomas Lawson and Robert N. McCauley (Lawson & McCauley 1990; McCauley & Lawson 2002) {{have proposed a}} cognitive theory of religious ritual according to which {{the way in which}} superhuman agents are implicated in the ritual's action structure has consequences for the repeatability, reversibility, and relative sensory pageantry of the ritual in a religious system. We tested their predictions by systematic interviews of participants in the Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic traditions as represented {{on the campus of the}} University of Michigan. The Lawson-McCauley predictions were strongly supported by our findings, but our research also raised questions about the causal mechanism they propose, as few of our informants seemed to have clear ideas about the way in which superhuman agents were connected to their rituals.

40|$|Metadynamics is an {{established}} sampling method aimed at reconstructing the free-energy surface {{relative to a}} set of appropriately chosen collective variables. In standard metadynamics the free-energy surface is filled by the addition of Gaussian potentials of pre-assigned and typically diagonal covariance. Asymptotically the free-energy surface is proportional to the bias deposited. Here we consider the possibility of using Gaussians whose variance is adjusted on the fly to the local properties of the free-energy surface. We suggest two different prescriptions: one is based on the local diffusivity and the other on the local geometrical properties. We further examine the problem of extracting the free-energy surface when using adaptive Gaussians. We show that the standard relation between the bias and the free energy does not hold. In the limit of narrow Gaussians an explicit correction can be evaluated. In the general case we propose to use instead a relation between bias and free energy borrowed from umbrella sampling. This relation holds for all kinds of incrementally deposited bias. We illustrate on the case of alanine dipeptide the advantage of using adaptive Gaussians in conjunction with the new free-energy estimator both in terms of accuracy and speed of convergence.

40|$|The precise {{theoretical}} {{determination of}} the geometrical parameters of molecules at the minima of their potential energy surface and of the corresponding vibrational properties are of fundamental importance for the interpretation of vibrational spectroscopy experiments. Quantum Monte Carlo techniques are correlated electronic structure methods promising for large molecules, which are intrinsically affected by stochastic errors on both energy and force calculations, making the mentioned calculations more challenging with respect to other more traditional quantum chemistry tools. To circumvent this drawback in the present work we formulate the general problem of evaluating the molecular equilibrium structures, the harmonic frequencies and the anharmonic coefficients of an error affected potential energy surface. The proposed approach, based on a multidimensional fitting procedure, is illustrated together with a critical evaluation of systematic and statistical errors. We observe {{that the use of}} forces instead of energies in the fitting procedure reduces the the statistical uncertainty of the vibrational parameters by one order of magnitude. Preliminary results based on Variational Monte Carlo calculations on the water molecule demonstrate the possibility to evaluate geometrical parameters, harmonic and anharmonic coefficients at this level of theory with an affordable computational cost and a small stochastic uncertainty (< 0. 07 % for geometries and < 0. 7 % for vibrational properties).

40|$|We {{critically}} review {{present knowledge}} {{of the life cycle}} environmental impacts of wind power. We find that the current body of life cycle assessments (LCA) of wind power provides a fairly good overall understanding of fossil energy use and associated pollution: our survey of results that appear in existing literature give mean values (+/- standard deviation) of, e. g., 0. 060 (+/- 0. 058) kW h energy used and 19 (+/- 13) g CO(2) e emitted per kW h electricity, suggesting good environmental performance vis-a-vis fossil-based power. Total emissions of onshore and offshore wind farms are comparable. The bulk of emissions generally occur in the production of components: onshore, the wind turbine dominates, while offshore, the substructure becomes relatively more important. Strong positive effects of scale are present in {{the lower end of the}} turbine size spectrum, but there is no clear evidence for such effects for MW-sized units. We identify weaknesses and gaps in knowledge that future research may address. This includes poorly understood impacts in categories of toxicity and resource depletion, lack of empirical basis for assumptions about replacement of parts, and apparent lack of detailed considerations of offshore operations for wind farms in ocean waters. We argue that applications of the avoided burden method to model recycling benefits generally lack transparency and may be inconsistent. Assumed capacity factor values are generally higher than current mean realized values. Finally, we discuss the need for LCA research to move beyond unit-based assessments in order to address temporal aspects and the scale of impacts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The {{composition}} of the injecting brine has {{a profound effect on}} the efficiency of water-based enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods. Recently, we observed that not only is the concentration of the active ions Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and SO 4 2 important for wettability alteration in carbonates but also the amount of non-active salt, NaCl, has an impact on the oil recovery process. Removing NaCl from the synthetic seawater improved the oil recovery by about 10 % of original oil in place (OOIP) compared to ordinary seawater. The results were discussed in terms of electrical double-layer effects. In this work, we have modified the seawater depleted in NaCl by adjusting the concentration of active ions, Ca 2 + and SO 4 2. Oil displacement studies in outcrop chalk samples by spontaneous imbibition were performed at temperature ranges of 70 120 C using different oils and imbibing fluids. When the concentration of SO 4 2 in the seawater depleted in NaCl was increased 4 times, the ultimate oil recovery increased by about 5 18 % ofOOIP compared to the seawater depleted in NaCl. The amount of Ca 2 + in the seawater depleted in NaCl had no significant effect on the oil recovery at 100 C, but significant improvements were observed at 120 C.

In this paper, we have extracted water-soluble acids from a crude oil with a high acid number (AN) to study {{the effect of}} these acidic materials on the wetting condition. The AN for the original oil was 1. 8 mg of KOH/g, while the AN for the oil depleted in water-soluble acids was 1. 5 mg of KOH/g. Two crude oils have been studied by a chromatographic wettability test and spontaneous imbibition using seawater as imbibing fluid to determine the differences in the wetting condition and oil recovery. In a spontaneous imbibition process at 110 °C, both the imbibition rate and ultimate recovery were higher in the cores saturated with the oil depleted in water-soluble acids. The difference in the imbibition rate and also ultimate recovery indicates that the carboxylic material from the oil depleted in water-soluble acids can be displaced easily compared to the original oil. The difference in wetting properties was also confirmed by chromatographic wettability tests. The water wetness appeared to be lower for the original oil compared to that for the treated oil. These crude oils were also investigated with respect to interfacial intension.

The article forms part of Jafar Fathi's PhD thesis: Water-based enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in carbonate reservoirs : initial wetting condition and wettability alteration by "Smart Water", Stavanger : University of StavangerSeawater {{can improve the}} water wetness of chalk at high temperatures, which improves the oil displacement by spontaneous imbibition of water. It is experimentally verified that the interaction between Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and SO 42 − at the chalk surface will displace adsorbed carboxylic acids and increase the water wetness. In this work, the effect of salinity and ionic composition of smart water on oil recovery was studied at different temperatures, 100, 110, and 120 °C. The ultimate oil recovery was compared using seawater as the base fluid. When NaCl was removed from seawater, both the imbibition rate and oil recovery increased in comparison to seawater at the temperatures tested. At 110 and 120 °C, the oil recovery from seawater depleted in NaCl increased by about 10 % of original oil in place (OOIP) compared to seawater. A decrease in oil recovery of about 5 % of OOIP was observed when {{increasing the amount of}} NaCl in seawater 4 times.
