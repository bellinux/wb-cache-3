[...] The title of Nebure ed was also granted to the administrator of the Church of St. Mary at Addis Alem, founded by Menelik II west of Addis Ababa.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the unique alliterative pattern of Beowulf 2717 b seah on enta geweorc follows from several factors {{associated}} with phrasal prosody, i. e. the tendency for lexical verbs to receive stronger stress than auxiliaries, the tendency for clause-initial verbs to receive stronger stress than verbs elsewhere in the clause, and the stressability of verbs relative {{to that of other}} elements in the same prosodic phrase or verse. Part I has shown, first, that verbs tend to be weaker in stress than nouns in Present-day English: Sievers 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Precedence</b> thus most likely follows from natural prosody of Old English. On the other hand, the alliterative patterns of finite lexical verbs in Beowulf indicate that verbs receive certain amount of stress. In Part II, section 5 discusses verses in Beowulf where weakly stressable words such as pronouns and demonstratives take precedence over nominals in alliteration, which implies that verbs should have chance to alliterate in violation of Sievers 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Precedence.</b> Section 6 argues that alliteration on enta geweorc as a formulaic expression is not necessary although the context in which 2717 b occurs does not unequivocally show strong stress on the verb. It also shows that the rare alliterative pattern and other problems associated with verse 2717 b are not solved by Donoghue 2 ̆ 7 s (1987) emendation. Finally, section 7 gives conclusions and the Appendix gives a list of verses in Beowulf that violate Sievers 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Precedence...</b>|$|R

40|$|In Old English Beowulf, {{the finite}} verb in verse 2717 b seah on enta geweorc takes {{precedence}} over two nouns in alliteration. This verse has been considered a serious violation of the so-called Sieverss <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Precedence,</b> according to which finite verbs do not take precedence over nominals in alliteration (e. g. Bliss 1967; Stanley 1975; Donoghue 1987). However, the effect <b>of</b> Sieverss <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Precedence,</b> namely, the tendency for verbs to receive weaker stress than nominals, is not something peculiar to Germanic alliterative verse but is also observed in Present-day English (Cruttenden 1997; Ladd 2008; Calhoun 2010). The rule, therefore, reflects natural prosody {{and there is no}} evidence that it is obeyed without exception in verse composition. Further, although the verb to see generally does not bear a high semantic load (Bolinger 1986, 1989), finite lexical verbs in contrast to auxiliaries show a certain amount of stress in their metrical behavior. Moreover, the alliterating verb in 2717 b occurs in clause-initial position where finite verbs show a higher ratio of alliteration than in other positions in the clause (Orton 1985; Y. Suzuki 2008). Lastly, enta geweorc, which cooccurs with the alliterating verb in 2717 b, as a formulaic expression rephrased elsewhere may not be strongly stressed. The unusual alliterative pattern in Beowulf 2717 b, therefore, can be attributed to natural prosody and does not provide motivation for emendation as Donoghue (1987) proposes...|$|R

(2010) and the “Amsterdam Declaration” (AD) demand {{more or less}} drastic and not necessarily efficient changes into this direction. Three groups of arguments in the AD are refuted: 1. The identification of organisms exclusively based on gene sequences is prone to errors and {{only a minority of}} the named fungi has been thoroughly studied so far with molecular methods. 2. There is no need for a mycological Code separate from the botanical one. Where taxonomy demands, special rules for Fungi have already been defined. The registration of taxonomic novelties required for valid publication is supported, but without MycoBank being entitled to make taxonomic statements. 3. Deletion of Article 59 is not possible without chaotic consequences. The mechanism of teleotypification alone does not lead to phylogenetically supported genera. Even after introducing a ‘one fungus – one name’ rule, mycologists will need to understand the so far prevailing system of dual nomenclature when screening the taxonomic literature. Objections to the recommendations of the AD include: A selection of generic names among either teleomorph-typified or anamorph-typified genera according to priority contravenes the time-honored <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> <b>of</b> teleomorph-typified names and would make many crucial teleomorph genera unavailable. – A rule that mycologists, who first choose the generic name to be adopted, would have to be followed and this choice has to be registered will be a serious source of conflicts among mycologists. – More weight will be given to the ICTF, an organization dealing mainly with economically important fungi.

40|$|We study {{a simple}} traffic {{model with a}} non-signalized road intersection. In this model the car {{arriving}} from the right has precedence. The vehicle dynamics far from the crossing are governed by the rules introduced by Nagel and Paczuski, which define how drivers behave when braking or accelerating. We measure the average velocity of the ensemble of cars and its flow {{as a function of}} the density of cars on the roadway. An additional set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> is defined to describe the dynamics at the intersection assuming a fraction of drivers that do not obey the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence.</b> This problem is treated within a gametheory framework, where the drivers that obey the rule are cooperators and those who ignore it are defectors. We study the consequences of these behaviors {{as a function of the}} fraction of cooperators and defectors. The results show that cooperation is the best strategy because it maximizes the flow of vehicles and minimizes the number of accidents. A rather paradoxical effect is observed: for any percentage of defectors the number of accidents is larger when the density of cars is low because of the higher average velocity.
