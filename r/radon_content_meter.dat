The results and conclusions are as follocvs : A close correlation was observed between the <b>radon</b> <b>contents</b> in the spring-waters {{and that in the}} ground-waters near the springs, so it seems possible to prospect the existence of radioactive springs by determination of the <b>radon</b> <b>content</b> in groundwaters in the place where no radioactive spring was found as yet.

Though the temperature of its well-water was 24. 0 °C in the afternrnoon of November 25 th, 1952, the hot-springs of Yamadaku-kyodoYu, Gunzeshinsenryo, Koyoen, and so on, issue neare by the well.

In our country, the decrease of <b>Radon</b> <b>content</b> was observed several days before the largeearthquake which occurred near Izu Peninsula on January, 14, 1978.

40|$|Abstract: For various {{engineering}} slopes, due to unloading {{relaxation of}} the rock mass or sliding disintegration of the slope, the cracks inside the slope will open by different extent, thus when measuring <b>radon</b> <b>content,</b> {{different parts of the}} slope will have different <b>radon</b> <b>content</b> anomaly. Through analyzing <b>radon</b> <b>content</b> anomaly, information as the landslide boundary and structure zoning of the slope rock mass, etc can be obtained. Landslide boundaries and rock mass structure zoning and other information can be identified because of radon anomalies analysis. Through radon anomalies analysis on two projects, landslide boundary identification and zoning on bank-slope adit rock mass structure, it has proved that radon anomalies analysis could be well used as a complementary method to provide more analysis data and thus provide objective scientific basis for slope stability study. The analysis method used is simple, easy to operate, and low in cost. In the analysis, it shall be noted that removing interference from groundwater, desiccant humidity should be excluded...|$|R

40|$|Determining the radon hazard {{potential}} posed by large rock units {{can be done}} using large-scale soil gas and groundwater surveys. However, an easier approach or some independent demonstration that all radon is being inventoried is often desired. One method is to use existing geologic mapping, rock and soil uranium contents, and {{to rely on the}} observed positive correlation between uranium and <b>radon</b> <b>contents.</b> However, heat flow measurements can also be used. The most important modification of Earth heat flow from the mantle in the southern Appalachian Piedmont is the heat contributed by the average radioactive element content in the rocks within a few kilometers of a beat flow measurement site. Thus the added heat flow is a crustal-scale measure of uranium, which is both an important contributor to crustal beat production and the parent of ^~n. Soil gas and groundwater <b>radon</b> <b>contents</b> for 10 heat flow sites in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia show an increase of groundwater and soil gas radon with increasing heat flow.

Since radioactive measurements are concerned with extremely small quantities of the order of 10 ^(- 12) grams of radium per gram of rock, a study of the methods of standardization for radon apparatus is presented in an attempt to indicate the requirements for accurate and precise measurements. The use of a standard radium solution, uranium minerals, and the Duane and Laborde formula are considered. An analysis of the theory underlying the geophysical applications suggested above indicates that soil formations are not expected to have a more or less characteristic <b>radon</b> <b>content,</b> that a high radon concentration in the overlying soil of an oil bearing region cannot be correlated genetically with the oil, and {{that it is possible to}} have a high radon concentration at a fault.

40|$|We {{present a}} very {{detailed}} {{study focused on}} the CO 2 and <b>radon</b> <b>content</b> in the groundwater circulating in the Colli Albani volcano and surroundings. A total of 650 water sites (wells and springs) were visited, with a more detailed sampling in the calderic and extra-calderic sectors of the volcano, acquiring new and more complete data {{with respect to the}} past. This study was aimed at highlighting the areas characterised by high CO 2 and <b>radon</b> <b>contents</b> in groundwater in order to: i) deepen their relationships with the tectonic features of the area; ii) evaluate the present level of Natural Gas Hazard (NGH) and iii) start a continuous radon indoor survey and pursue discrete measurements. In particular, new radon detectors have been built and tested in the frame of an agreement between INGV and DINCE (Department of Nuclear Engineering and Conversions of Energy) of the “La Sapienza” University of Rome. Large areas with CO 2 and radon-rich groundwater were recognised. They correspond to the well known main tectonic and volcanic structures affecting the area (horsts, regional faults, caldera rim). Existing faults and associated fracture networks allow deep gases to upraise and dissolve in shallow aquifers, generally over-saturated in CO 2, allowing a free gas phase to reach the surface, thus affecting soils and causing a widespread degassing (Figg. 1, 2, 3). Moreover, CO 2 can act as carrier for radon, also produced by quaternary volcanic rocks rich in U and Th-bearing minerals. As a consequence, the detailed mapping of both CO 2 and <b>radon</b> <b>contents</b> in groundwater can be a powerful tool in order to assess and evaluate the NGH-prone areas (Figg. 4, 5).
