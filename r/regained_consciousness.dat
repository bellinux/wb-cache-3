5|$|Hannah Beswick {{was born}} in 1688, the {{daughter}} of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed {{that he was still}} alive. John <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness</b> a few days later, and lived for many more years.|$|E
5|$|In December 1923, {{while visiting}} the Winchester {{residence}} of W. A. Baker, a fellow {{director of the}} Winchester and Western Railroad, Cornwell was rendered unconscious after a large longcase clock in a hallway toppled over, striking him on the head, and knocking him down. The longcase clock inflicted a severe wound {{to the back of}} Cornwell's head. He received first aid treatment from a physician present at the residence and was taken to his Winchester home where he <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness.</b>|$|E

5|$|On a clear, {{sunny day}} in July 1964, {{a group of}} six boys went {{swimming}} in the Roundout Creek at a park in Rosendale Village. After {{getting out of the}} creek, the boys were struck by lightning. One boy was knocked back into the creek, and <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness</b> as he was being pulled out. Two of the boys, Gary Schmitt and Ronald Morelli, died. Ronald Morelli was the son of Albert Morelli, who served as Rosendale's fire chief. Albert Morelli was part of the team that put out the fire at Reid's Village Inn.|$|E
5|$|The King's sudden {{onset of}} {{insanity}} {{was seen by}} some as a sign of divine anger and punishment, and by others as the result of magic. Modern historians speculate that he may have suffered from the onset of paranoid schizophrenia. The comatose king was returned to Le Mans, where Guillaume de Harsigny—a venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physician—was summoned to treat him. Charles <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness</b> and his fever subsided; he was gradually returned to Paris in September.|$|E

5|$|At the motel, Lila and Sam meet Norman. Sam distracts him by {{striking}} up {{a conversation}} while Lila sneaks up to the house. When Sam tells Norman they've come to question his mother, he knocks Sam out and rushes to the house. Lila sees Norman approaching and hides by going down steps {{that lead to the}} fruit cellar. There she finds Mrs. Bates sitting in a chair. Lila turns her around and discovers that she is in fact a mummified corpse. Lila screams as Norman runs into the cellar, holding a chef's knife and wearing his mother's clothes and a wig. Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam, having <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness,</b> subdues him.|$|E
5|$|However, Osborn had {{no control}} over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would {{automatically}} absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him going into a coma. After he <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness,</b> these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.|$|E
5|$|While {{attempting}} to rally fleeing French forces during a cavalry charge, Pulaski was mortally wounded by grapeshot. The reported grapeshot {{is on display}} today at the Georgia Historical Society in Savannah; The Charleston Museum also has a grapeshot reported to be from Pulaski's wound. A wounded Pulaski was carried {{from the field of}} battle and taken aboard the South Carolina merchant brig privateer Wasp, under the command of Captain Samuel Bulfinch, where he died two days later, having never <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness.</b> His death, perceived by American Patriot supporters as heroic, further boosted his reputation in America.|$|E

5|$|Crush {{attacked}} Doink the Clown {{outside the}} ring {{prior to the}} next match. After getting Doink inside the ring, Crush used his strength advantage to overpower Doink. Doink gained the advantage but missed two attacks from the top rope. Crush used more power moves to wear down Doink, and Doink tried to crawl under the ring. Crush forced Doink back into the ring and performed the Cranium Crunch, a head vice submission hold, on Doink. Doink pulled himself to the ropes and broke the hold. Doink hit the referee and knocked him unconscious; {{as a result of}} this staged ref bump, a second Doink the Clown (portrayed by Steve Keirn) was able to interfere. He hit Crush with a prosthetic arm, which enabled the first Doink to win by pinfall when the referee <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Midazolam {{acts as a}} {{sedative}} {{to render}} the condemned prisoner unconscious, at which time the vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride are administered, stopping the prisoner's breathing and heart, respectively. Florida used midazolam to execute William Happ in October 2013. The usage of midazolam in executions has become controversial after condemned inmate Clayton Lockett apparently <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness</b> and started speaking midway through his execution when the state of Oklahoma attempted to execute him with an untested three-drug lethal injection cocktail using 100mg of midazolam. Prison officials reportedly discussed taking him to a hospital before he was pronounced dead {{of a heart attack}} 40 minutes after the execution began. An observing doctor stated that Lockett's vein had ruptured. It is not clear which drug or drugs caused his death or what quantities of vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride were released before the execution was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer never <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness</b> and {{succumbed to}} his {{injuries}} {{at the hospital}} two days later on 15 July 1950. The investigation into the accident concluded that though {{the impact of the}} two vehicles was severe, it seemed unlikely that the collision itself was the cause of his injuries. It was speculated {{that at least one of}} the truck's cargo of 30 empty gas cylinders, which were thrown off by the collision, had struck Schnaufer on the head. Subsequently, the truck driver was charged with manslaughter and breach of traffic regulations before a court at Jauge, Cestas. The hearing began on 29 July 1950 and concluded with his conviction on 16 November 1950. Gasc was found guilty of not yielding the right of way, and his speed was considered too high. It was ruled that as a consequence of not observing the law, he involuntarily caused the death of Schnaufer.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a tag team match pitting {{the team of}} Christian Cage and Sting against the team of Jeff Jarrett and Monty Brown. The {{duration}} of the encounter was 15 minutes and 35 seconds. Jarrett was accompanied by Gail Kim. Cage and Brown started the match before they both quickly tagged in their partners. Kim interfered by distracting the referee, allowing Jarrett to hit Cage in the groin and throw him to the ringside mat. Kim then assaulted Cage in the ringside area. After several minutes of Jarrett and Brown having the advantage over a beaten Cage, Sting was tagged into the match and placed Jarrett in his signature Scorpion Deathlock submission maneuver. Jarrett submitted to the maneuver, but the referee was unconscious. Team Canada then interfered in the bout, attacking Cage and Sting. Jarrett bashed Sting {{in the face with}} the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt and covered for a near-fall once the referee <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Afterwards, Sting forced Jarrett's head into the ring mat with his trademark Scorpion Death Drop maneuver and covered for the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|In June 1968, Plante {{was drafted}} by the St. Louis Blues and signed for $35,000 for the 1968–69 season. In his first season with the Blues, Plante split the goaltending duties with Glenn Hall. He won the Vezina Trophy that season for the seventh time, surpassing Bill Durnan's record. While playing for the Blues in the 1969–70 playoffs against the Boston Bruins, a shot fired by Fred Stanfield and {{redirected}} by Phil Esposito hit Plante in the forehead, knocking him out and breaking his fibreglass mask. The first thing Plante said after he <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness</b> at the hospital was that the mask saved his life. That game proved to be his last for the Blues, and he was traded {{in the summer of}} 1970 to the Toronto Maple Leafs. He led the NHL with the lowest goals against average (GAA) during his first season with the Maple Leafs. At season's end, he was named to the NHL's second All-Star team, his seventh such honour. He continued to play for the Leafs until he was traded to the Boston Bruins late in the 1972–73 season, recording a shutout against the Black Hawks in his debut for the Bruins. He played eight regular season and two playoff games for the Bruins to finish that season, his last in the NHL.|$|E
5|$|Only D Company—which {{had been}} holding the summit and had {{withdrawn}} last—was heavily engaged {{and was unable to}} move at the scheduled time. The Chinese launched a determined assault, preceding it with heavy machine-gun and mortar fire, before attempting to overrun the forward pits. Once again the Australians repelled the Chinese assault and Gravener decided to begin to thin out his position before the situation deteriorated further. With one platoon covering their movement, D Company subsequently withdrew, closely pursued by the Chinese. During the rapid withdrawal after the final Chinese attack, Private Keith Gwyther was accidentally left behind after being knocked unconscious and buried in a forward pit by a mortar round. He <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness</b> some hours later and was subsequently captured by the Chinese who had by then occupied Hill 504 and were digging-in. Finally, the Australians succeeded in achieving a clean break after dark, and D Company was able to safely withdraw. By 23:30 the battalion was clear, completing its withdrawal in good order and intact, and suffering only minimal casualties. Regardless, the previous 24 hours of fighting had been costly for the Australians, resulting in 32 killed, 59 wounded and three captured; the bulk of them in A Company and Battalion Headquarters. Yet their stout defence had halted the assault on the brigade's right flank, and had inflicted far heavier casualties on the Chinese before being withdrawn. Significantly for the Australians 25 April was Anzac Day; however, following their successful withdrawal the Chinese turned their attention to the Canadians on the left flank.|$|E

5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although {{he did not get}} a good look at the creature, he describes it to the rest of the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously <b>regained</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because it is different.|$|E
