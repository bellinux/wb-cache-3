40|$|The eggs of Lygus hesperus (Knight) {{were labeled}} with the element {{rubidium}} (Rb) by rearing the nymphs {{and maintaining the}} adults on diet with 100, 500, or 1, 000 ppm rubidium chloride (RbCl). Anaphes ovijentatus (Crosby and Leonard), a parasite of Lygus spp. eggs, was marked with Rb concentrations above laboratory and field endogenous levels when <b>reared</b> from <b>labeled</b> eggs of Lygus adults fed diets with 500 and 1, 000 ppm RbCI. Rb concentrations remained sufficiently high to distinguish labeled parasites from those collected in alfalfa fields for 4 d. The parasites that developed in eggs of L. hesperus reared on diet with 1, 000 ppm RbCI tended to be shorter-lived and to produce fewer progeny than those from eggs of Lygus fed diets with lower concentrations, but only differences in longevity of males were statistically significant...|$|R

5000|$|Fort Manhassett's siting and {{construction}} was built with a keen {{eye to the}} tactical terrain of the marshy plains west of Sabine City. The area consists of flat salt grass prairie with numerous marshes and several large shallow lakes inland of the beach. These large lakes are generally 6 - 8 ft at their deepest, and the marshes support a huge variety of wildlife. The mile of open ground between Knight's Lake and the beach {{was selected as the}} site for the fort, with the road on Sabine Ridge providing a route of resupply and communication with the town. Colonel Valery Sulakowski, chief engineer of the Confederate engineering department in Texas, ordered his subordinate, Major Julius G. Kellersberger, to begin the construction of a series of redoubts, redans, and lunettes on the mile of open saltgrass prairie between Knight's Lake and the Gulf of Mexico. Sulakowski also ordered that a small slough, known as Redfish Bayou, just inland and paralleling the beach, be connected to the waters of Knight's Lake. This ditch would create a further obstacle for any attacking Union forces attempting to march on Sabine City from the west. [...] Fort Manhassett consisted of two redoubts, two redans, and one lunette. Redoubt A, Redoubt B, and Redoubt C were built on a straight line between the beach road and the southern prong of the lake. The three redoubts were built to contain a possible enemy advance from the west, and mounted several heavy cannon for that purpose. The two redans in the <b>rear,</b> <b>labelled</b> Flank Defenses I and II on Kellersberg's 1863 map of the Sabine defenses, were intended to serve as temporary defenses in the event of the forts being turned. The shell road from Galveston to Sabine City ran between Redoubts A and B. Redoubt C, which was actually a lunette, was sited in the marsh, making it inaccessible for artillery when first built; however, it is possible that corduroy roads were later built to allow heavy weapons to be mounted in the work, much in the same manner that machinery and pipe fittings are transported to modern LNG terminals in the salt marshes of the Texas coast.|$|R

40|$|In Africa and {{surrounding}} Indian Ocean islands, {{several species of}} scarabaeids cause damage to sugarcane. Although many factors affect the number of ratoon crops obtained from sugarcane planting, scarabaeid infestations can drastically reduce {{the ability of the}} crop to ratoon. This factor is often neglected in assessments of scarabaeid damage. Despite the importance of white grubs as pests in sugarcane production, it is not known for certain how many species of white grub attack sugarcane in this region. White grub taxonomy is important for developing effective control tactics. This study seeks to identify and classify Scarabaeidae life forms collected from sugarcane fields. Pits were dug in sugarcane fields, across cane lines, uprooting sugarcane stools. Searches for all developmental stages of white grubs were done in soils around cane roots and soils removed from the pit. Larvae and pupae were transferred, singly, into <b>labelled</b> <b>rearing</b> vials containing moistened peat. The vials were incubated in the laboratory at ambient temperature and checked periodically to monitor development. Adults collected from pits and peat were kept in a freezer, in labelled transportation vials. Beetles were also collected from ultraviolet (UV) light traps at ZSAES, Triangle Ltd and Mwenezana estates. Four hundred and six samples were dispatched to Stellenbosch University for identification and classification. Some larvae collected from the field and reared in peat completed their life cycle under laboratory conditions. The scarabs included in the collection comprised chafer beetles, rose beetles, rhinoceros beetles and black maize beetles...|$|R
