500|$|The episode {{received}} favorable reviews. Brad Trechak of the TV Squad said of {{the episode}}: [...] "In the end, the episode was <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> {{the beginning and the}} ending, but the middle kind of dragged." [...] Eric Hochburger of TV Fanatic criticized the Mike Scioscia cameo, although he said that [...] "hile this week's installment will never replace our favorite Simpsons baseball episode, [...] "Homer at the Bat," [...] there [...] certainly plenty of great jokes and a strong enough story with heart to keep us entertained." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club compared the episode favorably to [...] "Lisa on Ice" [...] although he also criticized the Scioscia cameo, calling it [...] "awkward". In conclusion he gave the episode an A-, the best grade of the night.|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as showing that Mitsuda was [...] "well ahead of the curve" [...] when he composed the Chrono Trigger soundtrack. [...] IGN described [...] "Chrono Trigger ~Orchestra Version~" [...] as having a heavy 1970's influence and as being [...] "a testament to Mitsuda's compositional skills", while calling [...] "Chrono Trigger Medley ~Orchestra Version~" [...] "playfully romantic" [...] with [...] "a fairy tale element" [...] {{in the beginning of the}} song that later transforms into [...] "an entirely more grandiose arena". Patrick Gann described the soundtrack as [...] "awesome" [...] and said that [...] "Kameoka is <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> orchestral arrangement". His primary complaint was the length of the album, as he wished it had been a full album instead of a [...] "mini-album" [...] of only two tracks.|$|E
500|$|According to Kahn, Spears pitched him her {{original}} concept, which included all the main elements {{used in the}} final version. Spears thought of the video as a sequel to [...] "Toxic", as seen in her documentary , whereas Kahn approached it as [...] "a 2008 answer" [...] to the previous clip. He added that, [...] "'Toxic' was a crystallization of her career at that time, [...] There are elements and moments of that I felt could [...] improved. [...] {{is a bit more}} fashion-forward". About how the concept of the video related to their previous work, Kahn commented that [...] "It's just a great girl fantasy. There are things she's <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>at,</b> like having a really natural knack for knowing what girls want. [...] It's a much more mature sound and much more mature lyrics, and she always has the greatest ideas. She's hyper-aware of pop culture".|$|E

500|$|After {{appearing}} as a recurring guest {{actor in the}} fifth season, actor Jonathan Pryce was promoted to regular cast member for the sixth season. Prior to being cast as the High Sparrow, Pryce was approached to play another role {{in one of the}} previous seasons and refused the part. After being approached with the role of the High Sparrow, Pryce stated that he accepted the role because [...] "If the role hadn't been what {{it turned out to be}} for High Sparrow, I probably would not have been involved. I remember starting out and my agent said 'does the character change the situation or is he just a functionary' and this character changes the situation." [...] Pryce added, [...] "Once I started work on Games of Thrones I was incredibly impressed with the organization, the crew and they're <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> their job and story telling so I have become a fan of the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> it. I have to look like I’ve been doing it a long time".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. It was the second script Daniels wrote for the show. He thought the staff had previously done many episodes where Homer [...] "wasn't good at anything", so he {{tried to figure out}} something Homer was <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>at,</b> and he {{came up with the idea}} of Homer being a good husband. While Bart had been the star of the show during the early years, by Season 5, the focus had clearly shifted to Homer. Writer/showrunner Al Jean stated that because Homer is an adult character, he has more depth to him and thus storyline possibilities. Showrunner David Mirkin commented: [...] "Bart, to write him accurately as a child, he can only have so much depth at a certain age. With Homer, we try to explore all levels of adulthood. There are just more places to go. Writing Homer properly is the trick, he's our main rock of the whole series. Homer's IQ is fairly flexible, he won't necessarily understand how to open a door at some point, but he can name the Supreme Court justices. Finding that balance is key to making the show work and making it surprising and making it believable and emotionally grounded." [...] Mirkin was very fond of the fact that Homer and Marge have the biggest fight they have ever had on the show in the episode, and he thought it was a [...] "really great" [...] exploration of their marriage. He noticed that because Homer is thrown out of the house, the audience really worry about their relationship. Mirkin had been asked many times why Marge and Homer are still together, to which he replied that all people stay together even if they argue, [...] "there's some sort of connection".|$|E

Gossard {{described the}} recording process as a [...] "non-pressure filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Gossard later said it was [...] "the easiest and most beautiful record, that we've ever been involved with".|$|R
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 13 laps to go. Logano dove underneath Kyle Larson {{going into}} turn 1 and Larson {{ended up in}} the wall with three laps to go. Larson said afterwards that he [...] "was able to clear them and I thought I would pull away pretty easily because I was <b>really</b> <b>good</b> on short runs. Joey and their team must have done a <b>really</b> <b>good</b> job <b>at</b> making the right adjustments. We made the car a little bit better, but I guess we really didn't take a big enough swing to tighten up." [...] Logano drove on to score the victory.|$|R

Dan came in with an idea that was some kind of concession, more 'can't we all just get along?' and I said, nope, I can't say that, can't do it. And we talked about it, and he said, what about [...] "I'm not ready to make nice?" [...] From the outside, normal people really weren't aware of how bizarre and absurd it got. Dan was <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> cluing in to that, saying something that didn't back down, but still had a vulnerability to it. This album was therapy. To write these songs allowed me to find peace with everything and move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Soulcalibur II, Taki {{was given}} more distance-closing moves to help {{compensate}} for her limited range. Nevertheless, the Soulcalibur II guide by GamePro verdicted Taki is an [...] "excellent short range fighter {{with plenty of}} height variation in attack," [...] yet still [...] "weak against good long range opponents" [...] and with [...] "poor offensive capabilities outside short range." [...] The game's review by Marlon Ramos of Philippine Daily Inquirer [...] "of course" [...] highly recommended Taki for the players who are [...] "after speed". In GameSpot's guide to Soulcalibur II, Stephen Kleckner wrote that Taki has [...] "a lot of options and variety which allow her to really mix up her attack heights" [...] and very quick moves making her highly capable at close range, but might [...] "essentially become a moving target" [...] if her player [...] "can't rush down someone who is <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> sustaining a range game, such as Kilik." [...] Andrew Alfonso wrote in GameSpy's guide that [...] "what makes Taki so fearsome is her speed. She's still the fastest character in the game, and despite this her damage potential is still very good at times. However, unlike the big power hitters like Cervantes and Astaroth, she needs to work for her wins." [...] Alfonso added that Taki can be [...] "somewhat hard to learn and execute with" [...] and the key strategy [...] "is to maintain her flow of attack." [...] Taki and Talim, who are both the most acrobatic and fastest characters in Soulcalibur II, were noted to be particularly dangerous in the original version of the HD Online edition due to the Internet multiplayer lag problems.|$|E

I think we do a <b>really</b> <b>good</b> job <b>at</b> just chasing the feeling, {{the core of the}} song, and allowing the song the ability or right to go where it leads us, where it wants to go. The song dictates that, and we've been working on this collection of songs for 12 months, so we know them pretty well." ...|$|R
5000|$|Boorman {{was unhappy}} with Goodhart's script, and asked Goodhart to do a rewrite, {{incorporating}} ideas from Rospo Pallenberg. Goodhart refused, and so the script was subsequently rewritten by Pallenberg and Boorman. Goodhart's script was being constantly rewritten as the film was shooting, with the filmmakers uncertain {{as to how the}} story should end. Linda Blair recalled that [...] "It was a <b>really</b> <b>good</b> script <b>at</b> first. Then after everybody signed on they rewrote it five times and it ended up nothing like the same movie." ...|$|R

60|$|Lastly, Dickens is even astonishingly {{right about}} Eugene Wrayburne. So far from {{reproaching}} him with not understanding a gentleman, the critic will be astonished at the accuracy {{with which he}} has really observed the worth and {{the weakness of the}} aristocrat. He is quite right when he suggests that such a man has intelligence enough to despise the invitations which he has not the energy to refuse. He is quite right when he makes Eugene (like Mr. Balfour) constantly right in argument even when he is obviously wrong in fact. Dickens is quite right when he describes Eugene as capable of cultivating a sort of secondary and false industry about anything that is not profitable; or pursuing with passion anything that is not his business. He is quite right in making Eugene honestly appreciative of essential goodness--in other people. He is quite right in making him <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> the graceful combination of satire and sentiment, both perfectly sincere. He is also right in indicating that the only cure for this intellectual condition is a violent blow on the head.|$|E
