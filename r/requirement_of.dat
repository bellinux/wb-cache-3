40|$|John Broome {{has argued}} that there are {{distinct}} <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> rationality and reason. Niko Kolodny has defended an error theory about <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> rationality, arguing that <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> rationality fall out <b>of</b> the <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> reason, not in the straightforward sense that one has {{a reason to be}} rational as such, but in the sense that <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> rationality are a byproduct <b>of</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> reason. Recent work in the theory of group agency and the problem of judgment aggregation raises a difficulty for applying Kolodny's error theory to the case <b>of</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> group rationality and group reason. This chapter explores ways in which the conflict between the proposed error theory in the group case and the results concerning judgment aggregation might be resolved. The chapter also considers what bearing the group case has on the success of the error theory in the individual case...|$|R
