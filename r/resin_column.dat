5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum. This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined.

40|$|A {{sampling}} protocol for the retention, extraction, {{and analysis of}} sulfoxyanions in hydrothermal waters has been developed in the laboratory and tested at Yellowstone National Park and Green Lake, NY. Initial laboratory testing of the anion-exchange resin Bio-Rad™ AG 1 -X 8 indicated that the resin was well suited for the sampling, preservation, and extraction of sulfate and thiosulfate. Synthetic solutions containing sulfate and thiosulfate were passed through AG 1 -X 8 <b>resin</b> <b>columns</b> and eluted with 1 and 3 M KCl, respectively. Recovery ranged from 89 to 100 %. Comparison of results for water samples collected from five pools in Yellowstone National Park between on-site 1 C analysis (U. S.

Attempts to extract polythionates from the AG 1 -X 8 resin were made using HCl solutions, but were unsuccessful. Bio-Rad™ AG 2 -X 8, an anion-exchange resin with weaker binding sites than the AG 1 -X 8 resin, is better suited for polythionate extraction. Sulfate and thiosulfate extraction with this resin has been accomplished with KCl solutions of 0. 1 and 0. 5 M, respectively. Trithionate and tetrathionate can be extracted with 4 M KCl.

The main aim {{of this study was to}} produce 89 Zr using various types of 89 Y solid targets through irradiation in a 12 MeV medical cyclotron at low currents using 89 Y(p, n) 89 Zr reaction for PET imaging in a preclinical condition. Five techniques of 89 Y solid targets were prepared for the production of 89 Zr. Gamma spectrum analyses determined energy peaks of 511 keV and 909 keV indicating that 89 Zr radionuclide had been successfully produced. 89 Zr was purified through a hydroxamate <b>resin</b> <b>column</b> and radiolabelled to a monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab). Experiments on biodistribution together with PET imaging of female balb/c nude mice having the HER 2 positive LS 174 T colorectal tumour were undertaken to validate the successful radiolabelling procedure between 89 Zr and trastuzumab. PET images at 24 hours showed a selective accumulation of 89 Zr-Df-Trastuzumab in tumour-bearing mice with good tumour tracer uptake in the right flank, as well as cardiac uptake, a significant presence of HER 2 receptor expression on the heart, demonstrated that the conjugated Df-Trastuzumab was successfully labelled with 89 Zr.

The first series of experiments on different quantities of hydroxamate <b>resin</b> <b>column</b> indicated that 50 mg of the resin was suitable for the optimum extraction of 68 Ga radionuclide. Series elution tests of 68 Ga from the hydroxamate <b>resin</b> <b>column</b> using various buffers including acetate, citrate and citrate in hydrochloric acid (HCl) with different concentrations were performed. The results indicated that 0. 1 M citrate buffer was suitable for 68 Ga elution and comparable to 0. 5 M HCl which is currently being used as 68 Ga extraction agent from 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator. Experiments on 68 Ga radiopharmaceutical radiolabelling reported that 68 Ga-Df-Trastuzumab radiolabelling was successful according to TLC and HPLC analysis results; however, weak radiolabelling efficiency was found for 68 Ga-Pentetreotide radiolabelling. In conclusion, 89 Zr was produced through irradiation at 10 µA using 89 Y(p, n) 89 Zr reaction in a 12 MeV medical cyclotron and was successfully radiolabelled to trastuzumab for PET imaging in a preclinical condition.
