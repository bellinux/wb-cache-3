500|$|Before Frémont, two generals had {{previously}} served {{as head of}} the Department of the West during the first four months of the war. [...] Brigadier General William S. Harney had taken a diplomatic approach in Missouri, attempting to respect Missouri's neutrality through the Price-Harney Truce, negotiated with Sterling Price, commander of the Missouri State Militia. [...] The truce was unacceptable to many Unionists and particularly to President Lincoln, as continued neutrality in Missouri would result in the state's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> men for the Union army. [...] Harney was removed on May 30 and replaced with the hard-line Radical Republican Brig. Gen. Nathaniel Lyon. [...] Earlier, while still a subordinate of Harney's, Lyon had raised tensions in Missouri to a fever-pitch by acting independently and capturing a portion of the Missouri State Militia during the Camp Jackson Affair on May 10, 1861. [...] Although the maneuver eliminated a threat to the St. Louis Arsenal, it also caused a riot in St. Louis. [...] As commander of the Department of the West, Lyon met with Gov. Jackson and informed him that, [...] "rather than concede to the State of Missouri for one single instant the right to dictate to my government in any matter...I would see you...and every man and woman and child in the State dead and buried." [...] After this, [...] open warfare commenced between pro-Confederate militia and Union forces in Missouri. [...] Gov. Jackson fled St. Louis, and the Missouri State Militia was re-organized to become the Missouri State Guarda pro-secession force under the command of Sterling Price and Governor-in-Exile Jackson.|$|E

Prior to 20 October, the United States and its coalition partners fighting against ISIL in Syria, had not provided any <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> Kurdish forces in their fight against ISIL. Much of the reason for US having <b>to</b> airdrop <b>supplies</b> was due <b>to</b> the Turkish government's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> allow <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> pass through their border into Kobanî. The U.S. specifically airdropped weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies supplied by Iraqi Kurdistan specifically <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> the Kurdish forces in Syria. On 21 October, a video was released by ISIL showing what it claimed was a bundle of airdropped small arms, ammunition, and other supplies from the United States. The Pentagon said it was analyzing the video and could not at the time confirm whether the video was authentic but that the materials were similar and video would be analyzed by the Department of Defense to analyze its authenticity. On 22 October, the Pentagon confirmed that one of the airdrops had been intercepted by ISIL but that it most likely would not give ISIL any real advantage in their operations.|$|R

25|$|The {{first book}} of the series Marching Through Georgia is a war story set during the Eurasian War, the Domination timeline's {{equivalent}} of World War II. In this war, the Nazis utterly crushed the Soviet Union, with only a Siberian rump state beyond the Urals surviving under a junta led by Marshal Timoshenko. The Nazi success derives from the Soviets suffering two recent, devastating civil wars, and needing to defend a long southern border with the Domination. Additionally, the Lend-Lease between the United States and the Soviets was rendered ineffective by Nazi U-boats effecting a powerful blockade in the Atlantic, Japanese naval hegemony in the Pacific, and the Domination's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> allow lend-lease <b>supplies</b> through its territory.|$|R
2500|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1944, a {{reinforced}} German Army Centre Group did prevent the Soviets from advancing in around Warsaw for nearly half a year. Some historians claim that the Soviets' failure to advance was a purposeful Soviet stall to allow the Wehrmacht to slaughter members of a Warsaw Uprising by the Polish home army in August 1944 that occurred as the Red Army approached, though others dispute the claim and cite sizable unsuccessful Red Army efforts to attempt to defeat the Wehrmacht in that region. Earlier in 1944, Stalin had insisted that the Soviets would annex the portions of Poland it divided with Germany in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, while the Polish government in exile, which the British insisted must be involved in postwar Poland, demanded that the Polish border be restored to prewar locations. The rift further highlighted Stalin's blatant hostility toward the anti-communist Polish government in exile and their Polish home army, which Stalin felt threatened his plans to create a post-war Poland friendly to the Soviet Union. Further exacerbating the rift was Stalin's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> resupply the Polish home army, and his <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> allow American <b>supply</b> planes <b>to</b> use the necessary Soviet air bases <b>to</b> ferry <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> the Polish home army, which Stalin referred to in a letter to Roosevelt and Churchill as [...] "power-seeking criminals". Worried about the possible repercussions of those actions, Stalin later began a Soviet <b>supply</b> airdrop <b>to</b> Polish rebels, though most of the supplies ended {{up in the hands of}} the Germans. The uprising ended in disaster with 20,000 Polish rebels and up to 200,000 civilians killed by German forces, with Soviet forces entering the city in January 1945.|$|R
50|$|Burgoyne {{returned}} to Quebec on May 6, 1777, bearing {{a letter from}} Lord Germain which introduced the plan but lacked some details. This produced another of the conflicts of command that plagued the British throughout the war. Lieutenant General Burgoyne technically outranked Major General Carleton, but Carleton was still the governor of Quebec. Germain's instructions to Burgoyne and Carleton had specifically limited Carleton's role to operations in Quebec. This slight against Carleton, combined with Carleton's failure to get command of the expedition, led to his resignation later in 1777, and to his <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> troops from the Quebec regiments to garrison the forts at Crown Point and Ticonderoga after they were captured.|$|E

50|$|Large-scale Soviet aid in modernizing the PLA, {{which began}} in the fall of 1951, took the form of weapons and equipment, {{assistance}} in building China's defense industry, and the loan of advisers, primarily technical ones. Mostly during the Korean War years, the Soviet Union supplied infantry weapons, artillery, armor, trucks, fighter aircraft, bombers, submarines, destroyers, and gunboats. Soviet advisers assisted primarily in developing a defense industry set up along Soviet organizational lines. Aircraft and ordnance factories and shipbuilding facilities were constructed and by the late 1950s were producing a wide variety of Soviet-design military equipment. Because the Soviet Union would not provide China with its most modern equipment, most of the weapons were outdated and lacked an offensive capability. Both Chinese dissatisfaction with this defensive aid and the Soviet <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> China with nuclear bomb blueprints partly contributed to the withdrawal of Soviet advisers in 1960 (see Sino-Soviet Split).|$|E

Iran's first attempt to procure aircraft from the United States in the 1920s failed due to Washington's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> equipment because of a World War I treaty. Until World War II, the IIAF's aircraft inventory consisted entirely of European aircraft, mainly British and German. However, following a co-ordinated British and Soviet invasion of Iran during World War II in retaliation for Reza Shah's declaration of neutrality, the IIAF's bases were occupied by the Allies and all existing IIAF aircraft were either destroyed or dismantled by the invading Soviets and British.

50|$|Due to U.S. <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> the Republic of China (Taiwan) {{with either}} the F-16/79 or F-20, the Republic of China {{government}} tasked its Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) to develop an indigenous fighter. Preliminary design studies began in 1980, and the Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) program was launched two years later. Since Taiwanese industry had not developed a sophisticated fighter before, AIDC sought design and development assistance from General Dynamics and other major American aerospace companies. With such assistance, a design was finalized in 1985. The IDF design {{is by no means}} a copy of the F-16, but it was clearly influenced by the F-16, such as the layout of control surfaces, yet it also features design elements from the F-5, like its twin-engine configuration. In December 1988 the IDF aircraft was designated F-CK-1 and named after the late President Chiang Ching-Kuo. The first of four prototypes (3 single-seat and 1 twin-seat) flew on 28 May 1989. A total of 130 Ching Kuo fighters (102 F-CK-1A single-seaters and 28 F-CK-1B two-seaters) were delivered from 1994-2000.|$|E
5000|$|At the Munich Security Conference in 2015, von der Leyen {{publicly}} {{defended the}} German <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> Ukraine with weapons. Stressing {{that it was}} important to remain united in Europe over Ukraine, she argued that negotiations with Russia, unlike with Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant jihadists, were possible. Germany sees Ukraine and Russia as a chance to prove that in the 21st century, developed nations should solve disputes at the negotiating table, not with weapons, she said. In addition, she noted, Russia has an almost infinite supply of weapons it could send into Ukraine. She questioned whether any effort by the West could match that or, more important, achieve the outcome sought by Ukraine and its supporters. On the contrary, von der Leyen said giving the Ukrainians arms to help them defend themselves could have unintended and fateful consequences. [...] "Weapons deliveries would be a fire accelerant," [...] von der Leyen was quoted as telling the Süddeutsche Zeitung daily. [...] "And it could give the Kremlin the excuse to openly intervene in this conflict." ...|$|E
5000|$|Under Article 102(d) [...] "tying" [...] {{is defined}} as [...] "making the {{conclusion}} of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts." [...] Tying one product into the sale of another can be considered abuse too, being restrictive of consumer choice and depriving competitors of outlets. This was the alleged case in Microsoft v. Commission leading to an eventual fine of €497 million for including its Windows Media Player with the Microsoft Windows platform. A <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> a facility which is essential for all businesses attempting to compete to use can constitute an abuse. One example was in a case involving a medical company named Commercial Solvents. When it set up its own rival in the tuberculosis drugs market, Commercial Solvents was forced to continue supplying a company named Zoja with the raw materials for the drug. Zoja was the only market competitor, so without the court forcing supply, all competition would have been eliminated.|$|E
