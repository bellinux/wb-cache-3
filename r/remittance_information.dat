40|$|Previous theory {{suggests}} that international migrants in the contemporary global economy follow an increasingly complex path to their ideal destination. One such theory is Paul 2 ̆ 7 s Stepwise Migration Theory. This theory posits that international migrants have a hierarchy of various destination countries, each ranked by personal preference.

Therefore, they make various migrations, developing their skillset and economic capital along the way, until they are suitable for their desired destination.

40|$|By {{assuming}} {{an economy}} that consists of labour sending and labour receiving countries, we investigate whether immigrants can actually improve their welfare by strategic <b>remittances</b> under asymmetric <b>information,</b> when wages are determined according to the efficiency wage hypothesis. For this purpose, we assume two types of workers in the labour sending country: workers with high effort and high productivity, and workers with low effort and low productivity. We also assume that information on effort and productivity of individual immigrants is symmetric between immigrants and firms in the labour receiving country if only one type of worker in the labour sending country migrates, whereas such information is asymmetric if both types of workers migrate simultaneously. We show that there are cases in which both types of workers have incentives for migration and strategic remittances at the same time, and thereby, neither of them can obtain higher wages. Therefore, strategic remittances can prevent both types of immigrants from improving their welfare. This result is in marked contrast with that by Stark (1995), which showed that only skilled immigrants have incentives for migration and strategic remittances and thereby both types of workers can realize higher wages.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{material}} and non-material transfers from and to two rural settings in Andean Ecuador. Within the broad realm {{of the research on}} remittances, it explores in depth the type, nature, composition, uses, meanings, re-workings and negotiations of the transfers between migrant and non-migrant villagers. Two villages in the Ecuadorian highland provinces of Azuay and Loja are the main research locations. These two provinces receive high remittance transfers, albeit from different origins: remittances to Azuay mainly originate in the US, whereas remittances to Loja are very likely to come from Spain and Italy. Due to very different socio-cultural features and different forms of migrants' integration in the two destination areas, these two highland Ecuadorian provinces provide an excellent comparative context to research material and social remittances. Fieldwork was carried out in migrants' villages of origin as well as in their new places of residence. This multi-sited ethnography was supported by a mixed-method approach involving a questionnaire (to gather <b>information</b> about material <b>remittances),</b> interviews (to shed light on social remittances) and participant observation (to provide the broader context for comprehending nuances in the data). This research incorporates socio-demographic variables, such as gender, family structure and generation, in the analysis of material remittances. The relationship between remittance senders and receivers, that is usually overlooked, is regarded as a very important locus of power and negotiations. A refined typology of material remittances, taking into account remittance senders, receivers and non-receivers, is also provided. Finally, there is a microethnographic account of material remittances' uses which problematizes over-simplistic pictures of remittance expenditure by embedding remittances into broader socio-cultural contexts. Surprisingly, given the large amount of academic work on remittances, there are still unexplored areas. Social remittances are one such area. By systematically researching social remittances, this thesis adds to the limited existing theoretical knowledge on social <b>remittances,</b> providing new <b>information</b> on their creation and content.

40|$|In any act of {{household}} migration, there are movers (the migrant) and stayers (those left behind), {{and both of}} these two groups have expectations. The movers expect to make some benefits at the destination while the stayers expect the migrant to send or do something at home of origin. Some work, though limited, {{has been done to}} improve our understanding of how potential migrants form their expectations of what they can get from the destination country in studies involving determinants of individual migration. But for those left behind very little is known about how they form their expectations of what they can get from the migrant. The few studies that have been done on this have only used observed flow of remittances to estimate what people left behind expect from migration. Hence these studies equate observed flow of remittances to expected flows. And by this equation, these studies also assume perfect information flow between migrants and relations left behind as well as perfect knowledge to help those left behind to form realistic expectations: expectations that reflects exactly what can be sent to them. Obviously these assumptions are not tenable. These untenable assumptions also leave a hole in our ability to explain why a household will choose to either continue supporting members for migration or not. This is because we cannot tell from observed data alone whether or not the desire to continue to support migration of a household or a family member is as a result of well-informed subjective expectations or not. The crust of the problem here is therefore that by relying on observed data alone we fail to account for the important role subjective expectations or beliefs of those left behind play in decisions for further migration movements, especially within the family. To be able to unravel this problem we need elicitation of subjective expectations of remittance flows from those left behind. Using data from a specially designed survey in two districts in Ghana, I construct time-adjusted subjective remittance expectations of migrant families at home of origin and analyse the factors that determine the formation of these expectations and how formation of these expectations can help us explain perpetuation of migration within a household. The key analytical models employed in these investigations are summarised below In order to understand the exogenous determinants of remittance expectations of migrant households, I first of all estimate factors that influence performance of migrant at home of origin and general flow of information between the migrants and the household members left behind. In order to see the effect of remittances on formation of subjective expectations, remittance flow was measured in terms of migrant performance by adjusting the flows to the time period during which the migrant could do what he or she has done. The items were limited to the popular ones people receive: money for living expenses, establishment of a house and business investment. The theoretical explanation for this adjustment is that if the observed trend in remittance flow has any effect on expectations it would be through individual household’s evaluation of what migrants have achieved within a certain number of years. In other words, all things being equal, families whose migrants took much longer period to achieve certain things would have lower levels of expectations than a comparable family whose migrant took relatively shorter period. This is because taking a long time to achieve something at home of origin would breed some kind of skepticism and uncertainty among those left behind as to what they can get from migration. And this skepticism can lead to low levels of expectations. This is also in line with the reference people left behind often make when talking about achievements of migrants at home of origin as they always point to what XYZ has done. Ordinary least squared regression is then used to estimate factors determining level of migrant performance at home of origin after the transformation of the dependent variable: migrant performance. Heckman selection model is also applied to control for possible effect of bias since some households have migrants who have done nothing at home. Kinship ties are the major factors under this investigation. To determine the main factors influencing information flow, ordinary least squared estimates are used while a generalised ordered logit model, with maximum likelihood method, is used to estimate the factors influencing the likelihood of a household getting higher categories of private/dedicated information from the migrant. Major factors for this investigation are kinship ties and performance of migrant at home of origin. Since <b>information</b> flow and <b>remittance</b> flows are suspected to have endogenous relationship, instrumental variables (IV) technique is employed to estimated impact of remittance flow on both private and public information flows. This is important for us to understand how information flow act as exogenous determinant of subjective remittance expectations, and resultant effect on perpetuation of migration. Once current information flow and performance of migrants have been examined and effects of their exogenous factors estimated, the next stage of the analysis is the examination of effects of these past performance and information flow on household subjective remittance expectations while controlling for other major exogenous factors such as kinship ties, level of education and household wealth. Ordinary least square regression technique is used to estimate major determinants of these levels of expectations. However, to control for possible bias resulting from the fact that a select group {{of household}}s may not expect anything, Heckman selection model is applied. The final analysis is the estimation of impact household subjective remittance expectations on migration-support intentions. Due to the problem of endogenous relationship between expectations and migration decisions, ordinary maximum likelihood estimates would not be very effective in identifying the real impact expectations have on migration decisions. Hence I use maximum likelihood with endogenous repressors to estimate or identify the influence of expectation on potential migration decisions, applying the probit model with selection model (heckprob) technique. Ordered probit analysis is also used to investigate what determines household’s desire to support more than one person for migration. The results are summarised below. Summary of Findings Economics and sociology literature makes us aware that in order to understand formation of expectations of any kind we first have to investigate two important factors: past events and current information flow, because these are the two factors that hugely influence expectations. Hence, for us to understand remittance expectations, we first have to understand two issues: observed past flows of remittances and current flow of information between the migrant and relations left behind at home of origin. If remittance flows should influence household or family’s (including the extended family members) subjective expectations and the support to move abroad, it should largely do so in terms of what has been observed in the past. In Chapter Six, I investigated the influence of kinship ties on receipts of remittances. As expected, closer migrant relations such as spouse and head of family stand a much better chance of having better performance from migrant than distant kinship ties such as friendship. However when it comes to performance in individual items such as house or business investment, a household cannot rely only on kinship ties with migrant. It should also have some wealth. Specifically, among the kinship ties only spousal relationship was found to have positive effect on migrant performance in areas such as housing and business investment. Thus the influence of kinship ties on observed flow of remittances is mostly limited to money for living expenses, unless the family left behind is wealthy enough to enable allocation of what is sent into other things such as investment in housing and business. With kinship ties being very influential in the determination of past performance of migrants one would expect that these ties would also influence information flow if the assumption of <b>remittance</b> and <b>information</b> flow being together holds. It has always been assumed by cumulative causation theories of migration that together with the flow of remittances from migrant to relations back at home is the flow of information that connects migrant, potential migrants and those left behind (Massey et al, 1993). If this is the case then relationship should be a key factor in determining information flow from the migrants, because these ties influence flow of remittances. Results from the 2 SLS model show that remittance flow has impact only at the lower levels of private information flow, reinforcing the point that information that comes with remittance flow may just be social issues such as size of family, marital status, and not economic ones. In spite of their strong effect on remittance flow or migrant performance, all the types of kinship ties generally have negative effects on private information flow. Thus kinship ties are not enough for those left behind to get more private information from the migrant relations residing abroad. It should not be surprising that remittance flows do not lead to higher levels of information flow from the migrants to those left behind. This is because remittances are mostly made up of monetary transfers for living expenses which may not carry much information with it as, in most cases, migrants do not require monitoring. And with electronic transfers of these days, it becomes more implausible to assume that remittance flows, which are mostly limited to monetary transfers, would generate private information as the interpersonal|$|R
