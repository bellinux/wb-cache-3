50|$|In France, {{notarial}} instruments, {{whether in}} public (en minute) or private form (en brevet), {{have a high}} degree of authority and are considered probative instruments (acte authentique), received as firsthand and primary evidence in court, and thereby accorded high evidentiary value and executory force, and deemed to be proof of their contents. A notarial instrument also fixes the date at which its parties are bound without prior delivery and acceptance (as opposed to a deed or contract under common law) and the data certa (date certaine) of the act's execution so as to safeguard against third party claims. To be rebutted or challenged, a notarial act must be subjected to a <b>rescissory</b> <b>action</b> called an improbation action (inscription de faux) to prove the act contains errors or has been maliciously altered, interlineated, edited, or falsified.|$|E

In the same way verify a Law omission matter nº 10. 259 of July 12, 2001 one which then carries to the subsidiary application of the Law nº 9. 099, of September 26, 1995 none that tolls to the prohibition your article 59 for preposition of rescissory. For so much it accomplished an analysis that should prevail input constitutional admonition and infraconstitucional law. It aimed to realize read again the laws one leave of the constitutional supremacy an end of providing the possibility of the interposition of the rescissory. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{emphasis}} on binding legal precedents imposes {{the creation of}} efficient ways to review decisions that are res iudicata before the pacification of the jurisprudence by the Superior Courts. Being elapsed the term of two years for the rescinding action, there are doubts about the revision of those contrary to the jurisprudence decisions on the terms of article 505, I of the new Code of Civil Procedure (BCCP). Alternatively, the New Code of Civil Procedure aimed to solve the problem, with a new term to fill the <b>Rescissory</b> <b>Action,</b> {{in the case of}} res iudicata were contrary {{to the understanding of the}} Supreme Court. This problem is very current on the taxation realm with the edition of the Normative Opinion n. 492 / 2011 of the General Attorneys Office for Fiscal Affairs, which foresees the automatic set aside of the res iudicata that were contrary to the understanding of the Supreme Court. The revision of this res iudicata maybe also important to the maintenance of the competition of a free market, as if only a company possesses a decision that exempts it of the payment of a specific tax, this company will have a great advantage in face of its competitors and this would create disequilibrium in the market...|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the initial}} scope of {{revision}} being ‘technical reform’, the 1992 BW enacted substantive modifications {{to both the}} prior Code and established case-law. The technical focus of the revised code is borrowed from the German BGB. The distinction between civil law and commercial law was done away with and brought under the broader ambit of private law. The Code now covers all aspects of commercial regulation—company, insurance, transport, consumer, and labour laws. For example, the 1992 Code now specifically regulates commercial contracts (Book 6, art. 119(a)). An unjust enrichment action is available (Book 6, art. 212), as are <b>rescissory</b> <b>actions</b> for vitiated consent or an ‘abuse of circumstances’ (Book 6, art. 44(4)). More generally, requirements of good faith now {{appear to be a}} constant theme throughout the Code: Book 6, art. 1 provides that both parties in a relationship are to behave equitably and reasonably towards each other. This appears to extend beyond contracts into other areas of law. The 1992 Code is more technical, systematic, and abstract than its predecessor. It is also more conceptual, providing for many well-defined principles at differing levels of abstraction. Throughout, the Code lays out a strict pattern of general rules upon which are built detailed ones. For example, tortious liability is founded on a general concept of an unlawful civil wrong. The concept will have differing applications in different circumstances. The Code is also more nuanced, providing for degree and qualification where an ‘all or nothing’ approach may have prevailed under the prior Code. The Code also loosens the legal positivism of the French system in favour of granting courts wider discretion in adjudicating cases. This discretion permits ‘intermediate solutions’ (i.e., not slavishly statutory) to complex problems.|$|R
