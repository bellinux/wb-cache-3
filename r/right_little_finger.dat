40|$|Abstract: Our {{non-invasive}} brain computer interface uses EEG {{signals and}} beta frequency bands over sensorimotor cortex to control cursor movement horizontally (i. e., one-dimension). The main {{goal of this}} study is to help people with sever motor disabilities (i. e., Spinal cord injuries) and provide them a new way of communication and control options by which they can move the cursor in one dimension. In this study, offline analysis of the data collected was used to make the user able of controlling the movement of the cursor horizontally (i. e., one dimension). The data was collected during a session in which the user selected among two targets by thinking and moving either the <b>right</b> hand <b>little</b> <b>finger</b> or the left hand <b>little</b> <b>finger.</b> The Adaptive-Network based fuzzy inference system algorithm was examined for the classification method with some parameters. In the offline analysis, the method used showed a significant performance in the classification accuracy level and it gave an accuracy level of more than 80 %. This result suggests that using the adaptive-network based fuzzy inference system algorithm will improve online operation of the current BCI system.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Kienböck's {{disease is}} a {{condition}} of osteonecrosis of the lunate bone in the hand, and most patients present with a painful and sometimes swollen wrist with a limited range of motion in the affected wrist. Vaughan-Jackson syndrome {{is characterized by the}} disruption of the digital extensor tendons, beginning on the ulnar side with the extensor digiti minimi and extensor digitorum communis tendon of the small finger. It is most commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. We describe a case of a patient with an unusual presentation of Kienböck's disease with symptoms similar to those of Vaughan-Jackson syndrome. Case presentation A 40 -year-old man of Indian ethnic origin with no known history of trauma presented to our clinic with a ten-day history of an inability to extend his <b>right</b> <b>little</b> and ring <b>fingers</b> with associated pain in his right wrist. He was being treated with long-term steroids but had no other significant medical history. His examination revealed an inability to extend the metacarpal and phalangeal joints of the <b>right</b> ring and <b>little</b> <b>fingers</b> with localized tenderness over the lunate bone. Spontaneous disruption of the extensor tendons was diagnosed clinically and, after radiological investigation, was confirmed to be secondary to dorsal extrusion of the fragmented lunate bone. The patient underwent surgical repair of the tendons and had a full recovery afterward. Conclusion Kienböck's disease, though rare, is an important cause of spontaneous extensor tendon rupture. The original description of Vaughan-Jackson syndrome was of rupture of the extensor tendons of the <b>little</b> and ring <b>fingers</b> caused by attrition at an arthritic inferior radioulnar joint. We describe a case of a patient with Kienböck's disease that first appeared to be a Vaughan-Jackson-like syndrome. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The biggest {{difference}} between the xindi and the traditional Chinese di {{is that there are}} an additional five finger-holes compared to the six found on the di. Additionally, it has three more finger-holes than the Xiāo (...) - an eight-hole flute which, itself, has extra finger-holes compared to the di, for the <b>right</b> <b>little</b> <b>finger</b> and left thumb. The additional finger-holes on the xindi are for the right-hand thumb, the little finger of the left hand, and the left index finger, which has to alternate between two finger-holes. The traditional flute exhibits imperfections during modulation due to difficulties in controlling the intonation of the semitone. Thus, the purpose of the additional holes is to help correct these imperfections. Through its 11-hole design, the xindi can play every semitone in the octave perfectly, and modulation is made easier and smoother due to its ability to be played in different keys. The player only needs to use their fingers to move down the holes to change key easily, whereas with the traditional Chinese flute the instrument itself must be changed.The {{biggest difference}} between the xindi and the traditional dizi is the xindi’s lack of a dimo (笛膜, lit. [...] "di membrane"), which creates the characteristic timbre. This is why the xindi is unlike the qudi (曲笛) or bangdi (梆笛), which have a brighter and crisper timbre. Its tone is between that of a traditional Chinese flute and that of a Western concert flute, giving it a much mellower sound.Contrary to the two differences to the traditional dizi, the length and range of the xindi {{is similar to that of}} a G key Dà dí (大笛). Its range is also similar to the G range, which is common with the flute. The common range is from a lower tone D to a higher tone E, a total of 15 notes. Occasionally it can play in the treble range, however the sound is not desirable.|$|E

Distal glomus tumors are relatively uncommon, and account for approximately 1 % of all hand tumors. Most of them are located in the subungual area because of its high concentration of glomus bodies.

40|$|Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS) studies {{report that}} viewing a given action {{performed by a}} model activates the neural representation of the onlooker's muscles that are activated during the actual execution of the observed action. Here we sought to determine whether this mirror observation-execution facilitation reflects only muscular specificity {{or whether it is}} also influenced by postural congruency between onlooker/model body parts. We recorded motor potentials evoked by single-pulse TMS from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles during observation of the <b>right</b> index and <b>little</b> <b>finger</b> abduction/adduction movements of models who kept their hands in a palm-down or palm-up position. Moreover, in different experiments observers kept their right hand palm down or palm up. Selective motor facilitation was observed during observation of movements that map the motor function of the targeted muscles, regardless of the posture of the observed hand. Modulation of FDI, however, was obtained only when participants kept their hand palm down; by contrast, modulation of ADM was obtained only when participants kept their hand palm up. Interestingly, electromyographic recordings showed that FDI is mostly active when index abduction/adduction movements are performed in the palm-down position, whereas ADM is mostly active when <b>little</b> <b>finger</b> abduction/adduction movements are performed in the palm-up position. Results show that the influence of the onlooker's hand posture is comparable in action execution and observation, thus indicating a fine-grain functional correspondence between these two processes...|$|R

In the second game against Australia controversy occurred. Australia led 16–12 with one minute left on the clock. England player Liam Farrell put a grubber-kick in the in-goal area which forced Australian fullback Greg Inglis to force the ball dead however the video referees decided to have a look and see whether or not Inglis or the incoming Ryan Hall got the last touch on the ball. On the slow-motion replays it showed that Ryan Hall's <b>right</b> hand's <b>little</b> <b>finger</b> had put some downward pressure on the ball however in normal speed it was deemed 'inconclusive' by Australian officiating rules.
