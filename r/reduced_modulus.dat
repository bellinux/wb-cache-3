40|$|Although the Hertz {{theory is}} not {{applicable}} {{in the analysis}} of the indentation of elastic-plastic materials, it is common practice to incorporate the concept of indenter/specimen combined modulus to consider indenter deformation. The appropriateness was assessed of the use of <b>reduced</b> <b>modulus</b> to incorporate the effect of indenter deformation {{in the analysis of}} the indentation with spherical indenters. The analysis based on finite element simulations considered four values of the ratio of the indented material elastic modulus to that of the diamond indenter, E/E(i) (0, 0. 04, 0. 19, 0. 39), four values of the ratio of the elastic <b>reduced</b> <b>modulus</b> to the initial yield strength, E(r) /Y (0, 10, 20, 100), and two values of the ratio of the indenter radius to maximum total displacement, R/delta(max) (3, 10). Indenter deformation effects are better accounted for by the <b>reduced</b> <b>modulus</b> if the indented material behaves entirely elastically. In this case, identical load-displacement (P - delta) curves are obtained with rigid and elastic spherical indenters for the same elastic <b>reduced</b> <b>modulus.</b> Changes in the ratio E/E(i), from 0 to 0. 39, resulted in variations lower than 5 % for the load dimensionless functions, lower than 3 % in the contact area, A(c), and lower than 5 % in the ratio H/E(r). However, deformations of the elastic indenter made the actual radius of contact change, even in the indentation of elastic materials. Even though the load dimensionless functions showed only a little increase with the ratio E/E(i), the hardening coefficient and the yield strength could be slightly overestimated when algorithms based on rigid indenters are used. For the unloading curves, the ratio delta(e) /delta(max), where delta(e) is the point corresponding to zero load of a straight line with slope S from the point (P(max), delta(max)), varied less than 5 % with the ratio E/E(i). Similarly, the relationship between <b>reduced</b> <b>modulus</b> and the unloading indentation curve, expressed by Sneddon`s equation, did not reveal the necessity of correction with the ratio E/E(i). The most affected parameter in the indentation curve, {{as a consequence of the}} indentation deformation, was the ratio between the residual indentation depth after complete unloading and the maximum indenter displacement, delta(r) /delta(max) (up to 26 %), but this variation did not significantly decrease the capability to estimate hardness and elastic modulus based on the ratio of the residual indentation depth to maximum indentation depth, h(r) /h(max). In general, the results confirm the convenience of the use of the <b>reduced</b> <b>modulus</b> in the spherical instrumented indentation tests.

An analytical {{determination of the}} <b>reduced</b> <b>modulus</b> profile of the coating/substrate system was developed, and the delamination behaviour of the coatings was investigated. Reduced moduli profiles showed an unexpected drop which was attributed to delamination and which has not previously been reported. The <b>reduced</b> <b>modulus</b> profiles of the coating/substrate systems were extracted and sigmoidal equations were fitted to them. It {{was found that the}} best fitting equation was a sigmoid with 2 adjustable parameters that control the slope of the sigmoid and its offset point. The variety of equations proposed in the literature was found to give less good fits. Those two parameters were found to be proportional to the coating thickness. Thus based on these results for a given coating thickness the <b>reduced</b> <b>modulus</b> profile of further PS & PMMA coatings of any thickness can be predicted without any testing, and the thickness of PS & PMMA coatings can be determined with just a few nanoindents. A novel way to determine when delamination of coatings occurred was found by plotting the variation of the final depth of indent against the contact depth. The delamination load, the depth at which it occurs and the radius of delamination can all be deduced. Delamination was found to reduce the measured coating/substrate modulus under static nanoindentation, this drop in modulus also indicated the indentation depth and load at which the delamination of coatings occurs. This drop in modulus was not present in dynamic nanoindentation. Nanoindentation tests were made with both Berkovich tip and a cube corner tip; {{it was found that the}} <b>reduced</b> <b>modulus</b> profile and delamination behaviour of the coating/substrate system was independent of the tip geometry.

The reduced moduli for Cu single crystals change from an average value to the uni-directional values, as the penetration depths decrease from several- 10 nm to sub- 10 nm.

The experimental results were compared to the finite element model. It was possible to match the data curves of the experimental tests with the analytical tests by adjusting the model parameters. Unfortunatly, this resulted in divergent results(plastic yield stress of ~ 600 MPa and <b>reduced</b> Young's <b>modulus</b> of nearly 60 % of the experimental data(32, 45 GPa and 20 GPa). As an effort to reduce the divergence between the experimental and analytical testing, multiple suggestions were made. </p...|$|R
