40|$|Purpose – Equal {{treatment}} in the workplace {{is considered one of}} the most fundamental <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> employees. This <b>right</b> also implies that employees must be able to address any form of unequal treatment freely and effectively, without fear <b>of</b> <b>retaliation.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this paper is to investigate the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>retaliation</b> against complaints <b>of</b> unequal {{treatment in}} The Netherlands and its underlying factors. Design/methodology/approach – This article is based on a telephone survey among employees who filed a formal complaint about unequal treatment at work to the Dutch Equal Treatment Commission. Findings – The main finding is that retaliation against equal treatment reports is commonplace in The Netherlands and in many cases takes on serious forms. Furthermore it is found that the nature and extent <b>of</b> <b>retaliation</b> are primarily explained by the circumstances in which unequal treatment develops and that the extent <b>of</b> <b>retaliation</b> is neither explained by the manner in which unequal treatment is addressed nor by the level of institutionalized protection that is available. Originality/value – The need for a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>retaliation</b> is high, because <b>retaliation</b> and fear <b>of</b> <b>retaliation</b> have broad consequences for the psychological and physical well-being of individual employees and for employment relationships. Yet, studies on retaliation in the context of employment discrimination are rare, especially outside the USA. This article contributes to a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>retaliation,</b> which may be used by policy makers, employees and employers to address it more effectivel...|$|R
40|$|A {{prominent}} {{problem with}} the WTO dispute settlement procedures is the practical difficulty faced by small and developing countries in finding the capacity to effectively retaliate against trading partners that are in violation of their WTO commitments. In light of this problem, Mexico has proposed that retaliation rights be made tradeable. ' We offer a first formal analysis {{of the possibility that}} retaliation rights within the WTO system be allocated through auctions. We show that the auctions exhibit externalities among bidders, and we characterize equilibrium bidder behavior under alternative auction formats. A key feature of auction format is whether the country in violation of its WTO commitments is prevented from bidding to retire the right of retaliation: if so, then the possibility of auction failure' arises, in which no bids are made despite positive valuation by the bidders; if not, then auction failure is precluded, and indeed the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>retaliation</b> is always retired. We also evaluate these different auction formats from normative (revenue, efficiency) standpoints. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ownership}} {{that involves}} transactions and barters {{is subject to}} the validity of the intellectuals and the lawmaker, which is created by hypothetical (i‘tibārī) existence and can somehow be called a hypothetical relation for whose validity the existence of local convention is sufficient; therefore, ownership is neither among the categorical accidents, the existence of whose subjects is necessary in the outer world, nor like the mental conventions that resembles the concepts whose accidents and qualification are mental. Right (ḥaqq) is a specific capability that sometimes applies to physical goods (‘ayn), sometimes to the contract, and sometimes to the person; such as the right of delimitation (taḥjīr), the right of option (khiyār), and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>retaliation</b> (qiṣāṣ). The object of right is in all cases an action that involves the physical goods, or person, or contract; whereas, property is a possession or domination that in reality involves the very physical good, or benefit, or action. Therefore, since the property is essential for absolute domination and the right is regarded as a special credit in some specific appropriations, the right cannot be considered as the property itself; and, furthermore, since property is by nature a simple issue and non-gradational, the right cannot be considered as a degree of the property. Besides, in some rights, including the right of delimitation and the right of specification (ikhtiṣāṣ), ownership is essentially out of question. Given its specifications, right is principally conveyable, relinquishable, transferable to inheritance except in cases in which a specific reason prohibits all or a part of appropriations and everything that is in nature characterized by right is apt to relinquish, otherwise it is regarded as a decree, in which case it is not relinquished except by compliance with decree or denial of the subject. Since evidences for transactions stand as enforcement of legal means, if in cases of doubt, there is certainty about transferability and doubt in deterrence or conditionality is the specific cause, the generality of the evidence of condition or amicable settlement (ṣulḥ) would be executed; and if doubt is in the transferability itself, the principle is the non-acceptance of transference. ملکیتی که مدار معاملات و معاوضات است، تابعی از اعتبار عقلاء و شارع می باشد که به وجود اعتباری ایجاد می‌شود و می‌توان به نوعی، آن را اضافه ی اعتباری خواند که وجود موضوع اعتباری و بلکه صرف وجود محلی برای آن، به لحاظ توقع آن محل، در اعتبار آن کافی است؛ بنابر این، ملکیت، نه در زمره ی أعراض مقولی است که وجود موضوع آن ها در خارج لازم می باشد؛ و نه مانند اعتبارات ذهنی، از سنخ مفاهیمی است که عروض و اتصاف آن ها ذهنی است. حقّ، توانایی خاصی است که گاهی به عین، گاهی به عقد و گاهی به شخص تعلق می‌گیرد؛ مانند:حقّ تحجیر، حقّ خیار و حقّ قصاص. متعلق حقّ، در تمام موارد، عملی است که به عین، یا شخص و یا عقد تعلق دارد، در حالی که ملک، احاطه و سلطنتی است که حقیقتاً به خود عین، یا منفعت و یا عمل، تعلق می‌گیرد؛ بنابر این، از آنجا که ملک، ملزوم سلطنت مطلق است و حق اعتباری ویژه در برخی تصرفات خاص به شمار می‌رود، حق، نمی‌تواند عین ملک تلقی گردد و افزون بر این، از آنجا که ملک، ماهیتاً، امری بسیط و غیر مقول به تشکیک است، حق نمی‌تواند مرتبه‌ای از ملک به شمار رود. مضافاً اینکه در برخی از حقوق، از جمله:حقّ تحجیر و حقّ اختصاص، اساساً، ملکیت فرض ندارد. حقّ، با اوضافی که دارد، جز در مواردی که دلیلی خاص، مانع تمام یا برخی از تصرفات می شود، علی‌الاصول، قابل نقل، اسقاط و انتقال به ارث است و هر آن چیزی که در ماهیت، به وصف حقّ، متصف می باشد، قابل اسقاط است و إلّا حُکم به شمار می‌رود که در این صورت، جز با امتثال حُکم، یا انتفای موضوع، ساقط نمی‌شود. از آنجا که ادله ی معاملات، در مقام انفاذ اسباب شرعی است، در موارد شک، اگر یقین به قابلیت نقل و شک در مانعیت، یا شرطیت سبب خاص باشد، عموم دلیل شرط، یا صلح، جاری می‌شود؛ و اگر شک، در اصل قابلیت نقل باشد، اصل، عدم قبول نقل است...|$|E
40|$|Although the GATT is emblematic among {{multilateral}} agreements in pursuing {{the removal of}} trade restrictions, it includes {{a considerable number of}} exceptions that allow the WTO Members to impose new ones. Art. XXVIII permits the WTO Members, upon negotiations with specified categories of other Members, to withdraw or increase the binding tariff rates on certain products listed in their Schedules of concessions. As these new arrangements are conducted outside a Round of multilateral negotiations, which is the traditional context for reciprocation of tariff concessions, they are called “renegotiations”. Art. XXVIII is thus prominent among the GATT exceptions, since it is designed to counteract what is considered as the core of the GATT obligations, notably the commitment under Art. II not to increase tariffs listed in the Schedules of concessions. GATS Art. XXI is analogous to Art. XXVIII, though it differs from the GATT provision in some procedural respects. Clearly enough, the rationale underlying Art. XXVIII is to provide the WTO Members with some flexibility in their liberalisation commitments. Tariff concessions made in the course of multilateral Rounds might become unexpectedly burdensome after consolidation. Some mechanisms for the adjustment of tariff commitments were thus introduced in the GATT to relieve the WTO Members from import surpluses. The renegotiation procedure envisaged in Art. XXVIII is perhaps the principal of these mechanisms but not the exclusive one. The “emergency action on imports of particular products” provided for in Art. XIX and the additional tariff flexibilities to be granted to developing countries in order to protect infant industries according to Art. XVIII are other relevant examples of adjustments of tariff commitments in the interval between two Rounds of multilateral negotiations. Unlike Articles XVIII and XIX, Art. XXVIII does not require the WTO Member willing to withdraw or increase its tariff rates to produce evidence of the negative effects of the existent rates on its domestic market. Art. XXVIII was conceived as a tool to be used by the WTO Members in the ordinary run of multilateral trade and not under the pressure of special or emergency domestic circumstances, such as a crisis of production or the establishment of an infant industry. In order to discourage WTO Members from recurring to renegotiations routinely – an occurrence which would seriously undermine the GATT predictability –, the drafters of Art. XXVIII assigned to the major trading partners of the Member seeking modification or withdrawal with respect to the product concerned a right to compensation or, as a last resort, a right to counter-retaliate. Most of Art. XXVIII provisions are procedural. According to Art. XXIV: 6, these same procedures are to be followed by those WTO Members which raise their binding tariffs {{as a result of their}} entrance into, or implementation of, a regional trade agreement creating a customs union. The establishment of a common external tariff on certain products, which is intrinsic to the economic pattern of a customs union, is indeed likely to lead one or more of the separate customs territories forming a customs union to raise their tariffs with a view to make them uniform to the common external tariff. Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) usually do not have a provision similar to GATT Art. XXVIII, while, for example, all of them contain a safeguard clause such as the one provided in GATT Art. XIX. In general, instances of recourse to Art. XXVIII have considerably decreased in number over the years. As from 1958, renegotiations started to be predominantly conducted under Art. XXVIII: 5. The gradual shift to this modality of renegotiations is easy to understand: under this provision, the WTO Members can act with a relative freedom, since they have neither to respect the time-limit of Art. XXVIII: 1 neither to obtain the authorization prescribed by Art. XXVIII: 4. As in practice the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>retaliation</b> has been exercised very rarely, it is to be presumed that the negotiations on compensation have been successful on average. However, there could have been other reasons which might have deterred the WTO Members from resorting to retaliations. Principally, they might have feared that third WTO Members, i. e. Members other than the Member having originally withdrawn or modified its concessions, could at their turn counter-counter-retaliate, withdrawing or modifying concessions of exporting interest for the Members having taken retaliatory actions first. Since, as illustrated above, a concession must be withdrawn or modified on a MFN basis, there is, as a result, an inherent difficulty in effectively implementing the retaliation provision of Art. XXVIII: 3...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{non-compliance}} with the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) recommendations and rulings emerges when the violator state fails to bring its inconsistent measures into conformity with its WTO obligations {{within a reasonable}} period of time. Compensation and suspension of concessions or other obligations (retaliation) are the only remedies provided under WTO law for cases of non-compliance. Many academic writings, as well as statements from WTO Members, have demonstrated pessimism concerning {{the effectiveness of these}} remedies, particularly retaliation. The central point of this thesis concerns three main issues: the problems <b>of</b> WTO <b>retaliation,</b> the question <b>of</b> the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>retaliation,</b> and the purposes <b>of</b> <b>retaliation.</b> This thesis aims to provide another perspective, besides the common “harm-resulted” perspective, for assessing the effectiveness <b>of</b> WTO <b>retaliation.</b> Accordingly, it provides several approaches: (1) identification of the purpose <b>of</b> <b>retaliation</b> in order to assess its effectiveness; (2) analysis of the enquiry whether there are in fact several purposes of WTO retaliation; (3) examination of the question whether the presence <b>of</b> <b>retaliation</b> purposes other than that inducing compliance is within the ambit of WTO law; (4) consideration <b>of</b> <b>retaliation</b> as a way of inducing a mutually agreeable solution; and (5) consideration of the question whether any deviation from strict compliance would undermine the WTO dispute settlement system. On the basis of extensive research on the purposes <b>of</b> WTO <b>retaliation,</b> namely through interpreting Article 22 of the DSU, examining the design of WTO treaty, assessing the academic writings/debates as well as the statements of arbitrators; several conclusions are made, of which the main one is that inducing compliance is not the sole purpose that WTO retaliation can pursue.
