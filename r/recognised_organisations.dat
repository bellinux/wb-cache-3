In recent years, massive land requisitions in the Pearl River Delta region have led many villages {{to experience a}} rapid expansion in their collective assets, highlighting the indispensable role of SCs in reshaping the landscape of local governance. Based upon an in-depth case study of the Guangzhou Luogang District, this study shows that the local state has engaged with shareholding reforms to achieve two main objectives: inducing compliance amongst villagers and promoting the accountability of village cadres {{in the management of}} collective assets. These empirical findings suggest that shareholding reforms were not simply a process of market building or property rights reforms driven by local initiatives. Rather, they should also be interpreted as a process of state power reconsolidation, whereby the local government sought to regain its control over the urbanising villages.

In that respect and with the scope to enhance safety onboard ships, Regulation No 391 / 2009 and in particular Article 10. 1 on certification of ships, suggested that European Union <b>Recognised</b> <b>Organisations</b> (EU ROs) should harmonise their rules and procedures related to certification of materials, equipment and components based on equivalent standards issued by them. As a result the EU ROs Mutual Recognition (MR) scheme was initiated. This paper investigates the current implementation of the requirements of Article 10 through a developed questionnaire and case studies. The results have shown that the current level of implementation is regarded as acceptable and safety is adhered to the highest standard. Moreover, the current implementation needs further improvement and harmonisation of individual rules may be required. EU RO requirements can be further developed in the future as the overall process matures. Additional information and dissemination of the overall MR process is also required engaging additional stakeholders in the marine industry. However, the expansion of the scheme presents challenging issues to overcome including the global acceptance of the MR certification...|$|E

This study reviews the current implementation of the requirements of Article 10. 1 through the analysis of available information from various sources and presents a critical overview of information available. The current implementation regime is also examined through questionnaires, interviews and case studies performed. Overall, significant progress has been made and momentum has been developed thus far. While safety is considered at the highest level for all products included in the MR scheme, the current implementation needs further improvement and harmonisation of individual rules which can be delivered as the process matures over the next years. Additional information and dissemination of the overall MR process is also required engaging all marine industry.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Technological Forecasting and Social Change and the definitive published version is available at [URL] synthetic composite indicators have been developed with the aim to measure micro- and macro-knowledge competitiveness, however, without any unified, easy to visualise and assessable forecasting capability, their benefits to decision makers remain limited. In this article, a new framework for forecasting knowledge based economy (KBE) competitiveness is proposed. Existing KBE indicators from internationally <b>recognised</b> <b>organisations</b> are used to forecast and unify the KBE performance indices. Three different forecasting methods including time-series cross sectional (TSCS) (also known as panel data), linear multiple regression (LMREG), and artificial neural network (ANN) are employed. The ANN forecasting model outperformed the TSCS and LMREG. The proposed KBE hybrid forecasting model utilises a 2 -stage ANN model which is fed with a panel data set structure. The first stage of the model consists of a feed-forward neural network that feeds to a Kohonen's self-organising map (SOM) in {{the second stage of}} the model. A feed-forward neural network is used to learn and predict the scores of nations using past observed data. Then, a SOM is used to aggregate the forecasted scores and to place nations in homogeneous clusters. The proposed framework can be applied in the context of forecasting and producing a unified meaningful map that places any KBE in its homogeneous league, even when considering a limited data set...|$|E

40|$|Original title: Verenigd in verandering The {{importance}} of citizens who unite {{in civil society}} organisations is broadly <b>recognised.</b> <b>Organisations</b> bind people to each other, {{to the community and}} to the political system. How are civil-society organisations in the Netherlands faring? Is there any truth in the sombre predictions that large organisations are in difficult times and are losing more and more members and donors? Or is the picture more optimistic and is there still a vital and broad-based civil society in the Netherlands? This study addresses this question for large civil-society organisations (more than 50, 000 members). It examines a wide array of organisations, from charitable organisations to sports federations, and from consumer organisations to political parties. Questions addressed include how member and donor numbers have developed over the longer term (since 1980) and in the shorter term (since 2009, following the onset of the economic crisis); and how organisations themselves perceive the changes with which they are confronted. Special attention is devoted to three organisation types that have seen their memberships shrink over recent decades: political parties, trade unions and churches. How do representatives of these organisations view this development? Do they still see a future for themselves and for the membership model? Hanneke Posthumus is a sociologist and social geographer. Until September 2014 she was employed as a scientific researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Social Research¦SCP, carrying out research on liveability issues, civil society and public opinion.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} of extremely {{high levels of}} engine efficiency combined {{with the use of}} cheap, low-quality fuels has resulted in significantly increased emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx) and particulate matter. Consequently the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and various national and local administrations have reacted by establishing policies to prevent and control air pollution from ships leading to a challenging task in understanding all legal and administrative requests. In the Revision of MARPOL Annex VI dated 2008 the International Maritime Organisation agreed to further tighten the limits on the emissions of nitrogen oxides. In the second stage (Tier II) a reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions by about 20 % compared to the previous values is required. The third stage of emission limits for nitrogen oxides (Tier III) shall apply to new buildings with keel laying from 1 January 2016 when navigating Emission Control Areas (ECAs). In particular, this third stage imposes a strong challenge for engine manufacturers, ship operators and certifiers (<b>Recognised</b> <b>Organisations</b> / classification societies) from a technical and operational point of view. As without specific treatment of the exhaust gases the third level of emission limits for nitrogen oxides is unlikely to be met. For this reason the International Maritime Organization recently published guidelines for the use of after-treatment systems. The correct executions of the guidelines have to be proven and guaranteed {{from the perspective of a}} classification society. Moreover the installation and operation of such systems must be both: in compliance with these guidelines and in conformity with a safe ship operation. To this end, Germanischer Lloyd has extended its rules to a section on exhaust gas aftertreatment systems. In this work latest updates and future emission standards for marine applications are introduced. The purpose of this work is to show technical solutions for exhaust gas aftertreatment systems from the perspective of a classification society with a strong focus on its technical, operational, organizational and administrative challenges...|$|E

We are especially appreciative of the encouragement for the Vision’s capacity to support radiation oncology as {{a key player in}} the multidisciplinary field, with the possibility to lead the patient relationship. The portfolio of our European Society has many different fields to support the positioning of its discipline. Internally, ESTRO has to provide a clear profile of its identity and an appropriate and easily understood language to describe its characteristic. This is what the Vision document and the continuous process of Core Curricula are doing, furthermore based on these ESTRO invites other disciplines to participate in our scientific and educational activities and supports its members’ training in multidisciplinary and leadership. It {{will be interesting to see}} member participation in a live tumour board simulation for different tumour sites that will be offered at ESTRO 33, to support daily practice. With other discipline or organ oriented European and extra European societies, ESTRO finalised reciprocal collaboration and fields of common areas like guidelines, education programmes and oncopolicy lobbying. In the last years ESTRO has been invited in growing numbers to meetings of other European societies to share our expertise, as well as to manage courses and master classes. Significant is the next publication of joint guidelines between ESMO/ESSO/ESTRO on gastric cancer, which opens an era of closer collaboration amongst these three societies in oncology. With national societies, ESTRO’s services have become more and more relevant for them being related to educational topics by UEMS, cost-benefit aspects of new technology and specific requests of individual countries. ESTRO has established the HERO programme to provide online services to evaluate cost-benefits of new technologies across different European health systems and a new National Societies Committee to optimise the liaison between ESTRO and its services, and the needs of individual countries. With the EU and other international agencies ESTRO is collaborating through ECCO as an allied partner lobbying to politicians, and not governmental organisations, the profile of our discipline and its contribution to multidisciplinarity. ESTRO is an established partner in influencing world <b>recognised</b> <b>organisations</b> like IAEA, UICC, WHO and is strongly committed to support the ongoing renewal of the main goals and characteristics of ECCO to be more effective in oncopolicy and in multidisciplinarity. With patients and their organisations, ESTRO is trying to better understand their needs and to support a patient’s journey across our treatment services, organisational procedures and ethical perspectives, namely in collaboration with ECCO. The ESTRO Clinical Committee is opening a new window to this direction with a sensible and effective hub of the different patient needs and expectation across Europe. On top of what the ESTRO can do through its programmes there is a need for dedicated people to serve our patients in a time of limited sources without losing the value of our activity, the trust in the cost-effectiveness of our treatments, and the reliability of our expertise. We are happy to receive a letter like this one that testifies to the individual and Society commitment open to larger collaboration, recognising in ESTRO a definitive partner...|$|E
