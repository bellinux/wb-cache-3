Since open quantum dynamics are stochastic, and not, in general, deterministic, the time reversal is not, in general, <b>an</b> inversion <b>of</b> the dynamics. Rather, the system relaxes towards equilibrium in both the forward and reverse time directions. The probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quantum trajectory and the conjugate, time reversed trajectory are related by the heat exchanged with the environment. Comment: 4 page...|$|R

In a control group the LED display produced responses of lower amplitude and shorter latency compared to responses to checkerboard stimulation. In patients with a definite or probable diagnosis of multiple sclerosis the stimulators were equally effective in evoking pathological responses; in patients with a possible but less certain diagnosis abnormal responses were found in a higher percentage when the LED stimulus was used. Differences in stimulus field size and in stimulus colour are discussed as possible reasons for this result...|$|R
40|$|The <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{positive}} integer A is {{the number}} obtained by reading A backwards in its decimal representation. <b>A</b> pair (A,B) <b>of</b> positive integers {{is said to be}} palindromic if the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the product <b>A</b> × B is equal to the product <b>of</b> the <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> and <b>of</b> B. <b>A</b> pair (A,B) <b>of</b> positive integers is said to be polynomial if the product A × B can be performed without carry. In this paper, we use polynomial pairs in constructing and in studying the properties of palindromic pairs. It is shown that polynomial pairs are always palindromic. It is further conjectured that, provided that neither A nor B is itself a palindrome, all palindromic pairs are polynomial. A connection is made with classical topics in recreational mathematics such as reversal multiplication, palindromic squares, and repunits.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Background: Surgical <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{small bowel}} segment has been {{proposed}} {{as a means to}} improve nutri-tional status in individuals with extensive bowel resection. However, clinical experience remains controversial. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects <b>of</b> bowel segment <b>reversal</b> on intestinal adaptation and whole-body anabolism. Methods: Male Wistar rats underwent a 70 % small bowel resection with (REV) or without (CON) <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 5 -cm small bowel segment (5 cm distal to resected segment), or sham-operation (SHAM). After surgery (day 0), rats were fed with powdered diet from day 2 to day 12. Body weight, nitrogen balance, carcass compositions, and serum concen-trations of albumin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) - 1 were determined to assess whole-body anabolism. The com-position and architecture of the small intestine were mea...|$|R
