40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a theoretical analysis model and a design procedure to synthesize aperture coupled microstrip patch arrays using a <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> feed. As a first topic, a lossy <b>radial</b> transmission <b>line</b> model is developed to predict slot coupling. With the reciprocity technique and a moment method analysis, key design parameters for realizing a <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> slot array are modeled to formulate the slot coupling problem. By applying the sequential array technique for circular polarization to <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> slot array design, good performance is found for both axial ratio and return loss bandwidth. The aperture efficiency degradation of a sequential array having elliptically polarized elements is investigated by evaluating the gain versus element spacing and polarization ellipticity. A sample design for a 18 cm aperture diameter <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> slot array with 42 % aperture efficiency validates these theoretical approaches. Next, an aperture coupled microstrip patch array with a <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> feed is analyzed by modifying the analysis model of the <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> slot array. By using linearly polarized aperture coupled patches as radiating elements, sampled designs of aperture coupled microstrip patch arrays using <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> feeds are used to demonstrate the feasibility of this new structure. ...|$|R

50|$|New rail {{transportation}} networks {{were built in}} Toronto, including an extensive streetcar network in the city (still operational), plus long-distance railways and <b>radial</b> <b>lines.</b> One <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> ran mostly along Yonge Street for about 80 km to Lake Simcoe, and allowed day trips to its beaches.

Thus, the Toronto streetcar system replaced the <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> between Queen Street and Victoria Park Avenue, making the latter street the western terminal of the <b>radial</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Under visual {{guidance}} normal subjects usually misbisect <b>radial</b> <b>lines</b> {{farther than}} the true midpoint (distal bias). We investigated whether this distal bias is constant across the peripersonal space or it varies by varying {{the distance of the}} stimulus from the subject. Subjects were asked to bisect <b>radial</b> <b>lines</b> presented below eye level either in the near or far peripersonal space. The results showed an increase of distal bias in the far-space. This Wnding suggests that the inXuence of spatial factors on bisection of <b>radial</b> <b>lines</b> is not constant across the peripersonal space. Distal bias increases {{as a function of the}} distance of the stimulus from the subject, according to a spatiotopic processing scheme...|$|R

The analysis was based on a circuit approach where the circuit parameters have been estimated using the first propagation mode in the <b>radial</b> <b>line</b> and the far field theory. The Archimedes spiral design, obtained with only one probe, has an efficiency problem due to the reflected field, that can be solved with this multiprobe design.

40|$|A new visual {{phenomenon}} {{that we call}} flashing anomalous color contrast is described. This phenomenon arises from the interaction between a gray central disk and a chromatic annulus surrounded by black <b>radial</b> <b>lines.</b> In an array of such figures, the central gray disk no longer appears gray, but assumes a color complementary {{to that of the}} surrounding annulus. The induced color appears: (1) vivid and saturated; (2) self-luminous, not a surface property; (3) flashing with eye or stimulus movement; (4) floating out of its confines; and (5) stronger in extrafoveal than in foveal vision. The strength of the effect depends on the number, length, width, and luminance contrast of the <b>radial</b> <b>lines.</b> The results suggest that the chromatic ring bounding the inner tips of the black <b>radial</b> <b>lines</b> induces simultaneous color contrast, whereas the <b>radial</b> <b>lines</b> elicit, in conjunction with the gray disk and the ring, the flashing, vividness, and high saturation of the effect. The stimulus properties inducing the illusion suggest that flashing anomalous color contrast may be based on asynchronous interactions among multiple visual pathways...|$|R
