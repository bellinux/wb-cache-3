5|$|The {{late onset}} of Huntington's disease means {{it does not}} usually affect reproduction. The {{worldwide}} prevalence of HD is 5–10 cases per 100,000 persons, but varies greatly geographically {{as a result of}} ethnicity, local migration and past immigration patterns. Prevalence is similar for men and women. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> is highest in peoples of Western European descent, averaging around 7 per 100,000 people, and is lower {{in the rest of the}} world; e.g., one per million people of Asian and African descent. A 2013 epidemiological study of the prevalence of Huntington's disease in the UK between 1990 and 2010 found that the average prevalence for the UK was 12.3 per 100,000. Additionally, some localized areas have a much higher prevalence than their regional average. One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons. Other areas of high localization have been found in Tasmania and specific regions of Scotland, Wales and Sweden. Increased prevalence in some cases occurs due to a local founder effect, a historical migration of carriers into an area of geographic isolation. Some of these carriers have been traced back hundreds of years using genealogical studies. Genetic haplotypes can also give clues for the geographic variations of prevalence. Iceland, on the contrary, has a rather low prevalence of 1 per 100,000, despite the fact that Icelanders as a people are descended of the early Germanic tribes of Scandinavia which also gave rise to the Swedes; all cases with the exception of one going back nearly two centuries having derived from the offspring of a couple living early in the 19th century. Finland, as well, has a low incidence of only 2.2 per 100,000 people.|$|E

40|$|Empirical Bayes {{offers a}} means of obtaining robust {{inference}} by pooling data on processes that have similar, although not identical, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> and then adjusting the pooled estimate through Bayes Theorem to adjust the estimate {{to the experience of}} each individual process. The accuracy of Empirical Bayes estimates depends on the degree of homogeneity of the processes within the pool.

In this paper we develop an approach to estimate the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> events assuming correlations exist between the rates. The approach developed uses the Method of Moments to find Empirical Bayes estimates of the model parameters. These estimates are adjusted to give individual estimates for each event using Bayes linear methods, a linear fitting procedure which uses a similar subjective basis for inference as a full Bayesian analysis. We compare the accuracy of the estimates obtained with our proposed methods relative to exact inference for a full Bayesian model based on a Homogeneous Poisson Process (HPP) with a multivariate gamma prior distribution...|$|R

2500|$|Earthquake {{prediction}} is {{a branch of}} the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits, But warning of an earthquake that does not occur also incurs a cost: [...] not only the cost of the emergency measures themselves, but of civil and economic disruption. False alarms, including alarms that are canceled, also undermine the credibility, and thereby the effectiveness, of future warnings. In [...] 1999 it was reported [...] that China was introducing [...] "tough regulations intended to stamp out ‘false’ earthquake warnings, in order to prevent panic and mass evacuation of cities triggered by forecasts of major tremors."

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} in-feed chlortetracycline (CTC) during lactation on health status and reproductive performance of gilts or sows in a herd {{with a history of}} porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome; to evaluate health status and performance of the piglets born to these females; and to investigate health status and reproductive performance of the same sows during the subsequent lactation period, when no in-feed CTC was administered. Methods: Two groups of 200 gilts or sows were monitored for two consecutive breeding cycles (phases). During Phase 1, the CTC+ group received CTC in the feed (10 g per animal daily) from 5 days before farrowing until the first service after weaning. The CTC- group received non-medicated feed. During Phase 2, both groups received non-medicated feed. Results: <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> poor appetite and vaginal discharges were lower for the CTC+ group during both phases, and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> clinical mastitis, anestrus, and returns-to-estrus were lower for CTC+ sows in Phase 1. The CTC+ sows lost less body weight during lactation, had a shorter wean-to-first estrus interval in Phase 1, and had a shorter interval between Phases 1 and Phase 2 farrowing dates. More piglets were weaned from CTC+ sows, and the piglets had lower mean throughout-lactation diarrhea scores in both phases and heavier weaning weights in Phase 1. Implications: In-feed administration of CTC during lactation improved health and performance of sows and their piglets. The beneficial effects continued during the subsequent lactation, when no CTC was administered...|$|R
