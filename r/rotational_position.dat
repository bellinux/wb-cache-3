40|$|MMTV-LTR {{sequences}} - 190 /- 45 {{position a}} histone octamer both in vivo and in vitro. Experimental evidence suggested that nucleosome <b>rotational</b> <b>positioning</b> {{is determined by}} the DNA sequence itself. We developed an algorithm that is able to predict the most favorable path of a given DNA sequence over a histone octamer, based on rotational preferences of different dinucleotides. Our analysis shows that these preferences are sufficient for explaining the observed <b>rotational</b> <b>positioning</b> of the MMTV-LTR nucleosome, at one base pair accuracy level. Computer-generated 3 -D models of the experimentally calculated and predicted MMTV-LTR nucleosome show that the predicted orientation is fully compatible with the currently available data in terms of accessibility of relevant sequences to regulatory proteins...|$|R

50|$|A Swivel is a {{mechanical}} device {{used on a}} drilling rig that hangs directly under the traveling block and directly above the kelly drive, that provides the ability for the kelly (and subsequently the drill string) to rotate while allowing the traveling block to remain in a stationary <b>rotational</b> <b>position</b> (yet allow vertical movement {{up and down the}} derrick) while simultaneously allowing the introduction of drilling fluid into the drill string.|$|E

40|$|We {{assess the}} role of {{intrinsic}} histone-DNA interactions by mapping nucleosomes assembled in vitro on genomic DNA. Nucleosomes strongly prefer yeast DNA over Escherichia coli DNA, indicating that the yeast genome evolved to favor nucleosome formation. Many yeast promoter and terminator regions intrinsically disfavor nucleosome formation, and nucleosomes assembled in vitro show strong <b>rotational</b> <b>positioning.</b> Nucleosome arrays generated by the ACF assembly factor have fewer nucleosome-free regions, reduced <b>rotational</b> <b>positioning</b> and less translational positioning than obtained by intrinsic histone-DNA interactions. Notably, nucleosomes assembled in vitro have only a limited preference for specific translational positions and do not show the pattern observed in vivo. Our results argue against a genomic code for nucleosome positioning, and they suggest that the nucleosomal pattern in coding regions arises primarily from statistical positioning from a barrier near the promoter that involves some aspect of transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase II. © 2009 Nature America, Inc.

5000|$|Important process {{variables}} in gravure coating & printing are the <b>rotational</b> <b>position</b> {{at which the}} blade wipes the cylinder; the angle that the blade makes with the tangent to the cylinder at the contact point; and the pressure applied to the blade.

40|$|Gene {{expression}} requires binding of transcription {{factors to}} their cognate DNA response elements, {{the latter being}} often integrated into sequence-specifically positioned nucleosomes. To investigate the constraints imposed on factor-DNA recognition by the nucleosomal organization, we studied the binding of glucocorticoid receptor to a single glucocorticoid response element (GRE) displaying four different rotational frames in three different translational positions in reconstituted nucleosomes. We demonstrate that rotational setting of the GRE per se is important for its accessibility. Furthermore, the effects of <b>rotational</b> <b>positioning</b> of the GRE are different for different translational positions of the GRE in the nucleosome. A GRE placed near the nucleosomal dyad is totally blocked by rotating it 180 degrees so that the major groove of the GRE faces the histone octamer. If, on the other hand, the GRE is placed about 40 bp from the nucleosome dyad, then the 180 degrees rotation of the GRE still allows glucocorticoid receptor binding, albeit with a sixfold lower affinity than the peripherally oriented GRE. This suggests that both the <b>rotational</b> <b>positioning</b> and the translational positioning function {{as a framework for}} transcription factor response elements in gene regulation...|$|R

2500|$|A {{fundamental}} solution {{usually has}} eight variants (including its original form) obtained by rotating 90, 180, or 270° and then reflecting {{each of the}} four rotational variants in a mirror in a fixed position. However, should a solution be equivalent to its own 90° rotation (as happens to one solution with five queens on a 5×5 board), that fundamental solution will have only two variants (itself and its reflection). Should a solution be equivalent to its own 180° rotation (but not to its 90° rotation), it will have four variants (itself and its reflection, its 90° rotation and the reflection of that). If n > 1, it is not possible for a solution to be equivalent to its own reflection because that would require two queens to be facing each other. [...] Of the 12 fundamental solutions to the problem with eight queens on an 8×8 board, exactly one (solution 12 below) is equal to its own 180° rotation, and none is equal to its 90° rotation; thus, the number of distinct solutions is 11×8 + 1×4 = 92 (where the 8 is derived from four 90° <b>rotational</b> <b>positions</b> and their reflections, and the 4 is derived from two 180° <b>rotational</b> <b>positions</b> and their reflections).|$|R
50|$|The {{center of}} every LightScribe disc {{has a unique}} code that allows the drive to know the precise <b>rotational</b> <b>position</b> of the disc. This, in {{combination}} with the drive hardware, allows it to know the precise position from the center outwards, and the disc can be labeled while spinning at high speed using these references. It also serves a secondary purpose: the same disc can be labeled with the same image multiple times. Each successive labeling will darken the blacks and increase image contrast (see drawbacks). Successive burns are perfectly aligned.|$|E

For example, with a {{magnetic}} Hall effect sensor, the EFM32 can convert <b>rotational</b> <b>position</b> to quantified speed or flow rate. This is a common situation in water or heat flow metering. The EFM32 can be used in Stop Mode (EM3) to count pulses and then calculate flow. Operating power consumption in this state could be as low as 650 nA (3Vdc), which has significant (positive) implications for battery-operated meters.|$|E
50|$|NCQ {{differs from}} TCQ in that, with NCQ, each command is of equal importance, but NCQ's host bus adapter also {{programs}} its own first party DMA engine with CPU-given DMA parameters during its command sequence whereas TCQ interrupts the CPU during command queries and requires it to modulate the ATA host bus adapter's third party DMA engine. NCQ's implementation is preferable because the drive has more accurate knowledge of its performance characteristics {{and is able}} to account for its <b>rotational</b> <b>position.</b> Both NCQ and TCQ have a maximum queue length of 32 outstanding commands (31 in practice).|$|E
40|$|Proper femoral and tibial {{component}} <b>rotational</b> <b>positioning</b> in TKA {{is critical}} for outcomes. Several rotational landmarks are frequently used with different advantages and limitations. We wondered whether coronal axes in the tibia and femur based on the transepicondylar axis in the femur would correlate with anteroposterior deformity. We obtained computed tomography scans of 100 patients with arthritis before they underwent TKA. We measured the posterior condylar angle on the femoral side and the angle between Akagi’s line and perpendicular to the projection of the femoral transepicondylar axis on the tibial side. On the femoral side, we found a linear relationship between the posterior condylar angle and coronal deformity with valgus knees having a larger angle than varus knees, ie, gradual external rotation increased with increased coronal deformity from varus to valgus. On the tibial side, the angle between Akagi’s line and the perpendicular line to the femoral transepicondylar axis was on average approximately 0 °, but we observed substantial interindividual variability without any relationship to gender or deformity. A preoperative computed tomography scan was a useful, simple, and relatively inexpensive tool to identify relevant anatomy and to adjust <b>rotational</b> <b>positioning.</b> We do not, however, recommend routine use because on the femoral side, we found a relationship between rotational landmarks and coronal deformity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA new Stratified Approach For Enhanced Reliability (SAFER) pre-clinical {{simulation}} {{testing of}} joint prostheses {{has been described}} in a preceding paper in this volume. The application of SAFER in vitro simulation and testing to metal-on-metal bearings is described in this review paper. The review aims to provide further understanding of the reasons for, and causes of, increased wear in metal-on-metal hips in a proportion of patients. Variation in positioning (mal-positioning) {{of the head and}} cup in hip prostheses results in the head contacting the rim of the cup and producing increased wear. Variation in both translational and <b>rotational</b> <b>positioning</b> has been investigated. Variation in translational positioning of the centres of the head and cup, which is not detected on radiographs, is a frequent occurrence clinically and can result in a substantial increase in wear rate. The variation in translational positioning acts synergistically with variation in <b>rotational</b> <b>positioning</b> to produce substantial increases in wear. These recent findings are consistent with the wear mechanisms and formation of stripe wear reported for ceramic-on-ceramic bearings over a decade ago, and provide insight into the reasons for the variation and increases in the wear rate found clinically in metal-on-metal hips in specific patients, which may cause premature failure...|$|R
