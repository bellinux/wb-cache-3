5000|$|First {{time the}} Moravian Mission in 1860 {{has talked about}} the {{possibility}} of a tunnel through Rohtang Pass to reach Lahaul and later Pandit Nehru talked about a <b>rope</b> <b>way</b> to Rohtang Pass which again made a point of discussion among the local tribes. After almost 139 years of the first instance, when a childhood friend of a Lahaul resident Mr. Arjun Gopal became Prime Minister of India as Shri Atal Bihari Bajpai, the locals insisted Arjun Gopal to meet the Prime Minister and talk about Rohtang Tunnel. Then he moves with two of his companions Chhering Dorje and Abhay Chand to Delhi and after continuous discussions of about one year, finally Prime Minister Atal Bihari Bajpai agreed and visited headquarter of Lahaul in year 2000 June and declared the construction of Rohtang Tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Palani {{is home to}} one of {{the most}} sacred shrines of the Lord Muruga, as worshiped in the Hindu sect of Kaumaram.

50|$|Construction {{lasted from}} 1913 to 1934, slowed by World War I, {{economic}} and political crises and {{the complexity of the}} work. The work also often had to be carried out on unstable land and the tunnels had to be built largely through clay and sand schists, which are poor soils for tunnelling due to the instability of the schist and the tendency of clay to swell. Before 18.5 km-long Apennine Tunnel construction could be commenced two temporary 950 mm-gauge construction railways had to be built from Sasso Marconi up the Setta Valley to the northern tunnel entrance and from Parato up the Bisenzio Valley to the southern tunnel entrance. An aerial <b>rope</b> <b>way</b> was also built from the northern entrance to carry construction material to a work site built at Cà di Landino above the centre of the tunnel in the town of Castiglione dei Pepoli; Cà di Landino was connected to work sites in the Apennine Tunnel by two additional tunnels (both over 500 metres long) built at an angle of 27 degree. These preliminary works were completed in 1920 and construction of Apennine Tunnel then commenced, taking another 11 years to be completed. These works were affected by methane gas leaks, which were generally dealt with by controlled explosions, with only four causing serious interruption to the work. On the other hand, a fire set off by blasting led to a serious fire in the wooden timbering used to shore up the tunnel temporarily, which burnt {{for two and a half}} months, before it was flooded with water. It took another four and a half months to repair the tunnel, during which the work continued beyond the burnt section, accessed by a by-pass tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Vitosha (Витоша), {{the ancient}} Scomius or Scombrus, is a {{volcanic}} mountain massif, {{on the outskirts}} of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Vitosha is one of the symbols of Sofia and the closest site for hiking, alpinism and skiing. Convenient bus lines and <b>rope</b> <b>ways</b> render the mountain easily accessible. Vitosha has the outlines of an enormous dome. The territory of the mountain includes Vitosha nature park that encompasses the best known and most frequently visited parts. The foothills of Vitosha shelter resort quarters of Sofia; Knyazhevo quarter has mineral springs. Vitosha is the oldest nature park in the Balkans.The mountain emerged as a result of volcanic activity and has been subsequently shaped by the slow folding of the granite rock layers and a series of gradual uplifts of the area. It appears dome shaped at first sight, but the mountain, 19 km long by 17 km wide, actually consists of concentric denudational plateaus rising in tiers one above the other. Vitosha is separated into four main parts whose main ridges gather at a crown known as Cherni Vrah ("Black Peak"). This is the highest point of the mountain at 2290 m and is one of 10 peaks of Vitosha over 2000 m in height.|$|R
