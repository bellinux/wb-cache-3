The following aspects are considered (1) on the hand of foreign literature the average severity of collisions <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> or <b>with</b> concrete barriers is indicated (2) on the hand of Dutch accident data the severity of collisions <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> crash barriers is mentioned (3) on the hand of mathematical simulations th vehicle dynamics at collisions <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> and concrete crash barriers are given, and (4) on the hand of data found in 1 - 3, the average difference in severity is estimated...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental data}} generated for calibrating {{finite element models}} to predict the performance of reinforced concrete panels {{with a wide range}} of construction details under blast loading. The specimens were 1. 2 m square panels constructed using Normal Weight Concrete (NWC) or Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC). FRC consisted of macro-synthetic fibers dispersed in NWC. Five types of panels were tested: NWC panels <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> bars; FRC panels without additional reinforcement; FRC panels <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> bars; NWC panels with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars; and NWC panels reinforced <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> bars and external GFRP laminates on both faces. Each panel type was constructed with three thicknesses: 152 mm, 254 mm, and 356 mm. FRC panels <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> bars had the best performance for new construction. NWC panels reinforced <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> bars and external GFRP laminates on both faces had the best performance for strengthening or rehabilitation of existing structures. The performance of NWC panels with GFRP bars was strongly influenced by the bar spacing. The behavior of the panels is classified in terms of damage using immediate occupancy, life safety, and near collapse performance levels. Preliminary dynamic simulations are compared to the experimental results...|$|R
