40|$|Das Prinzip der Freizügigkeit. Eine Idee für alle". Presentation (in German) by Charlotte Sieber-Gasser at the 2 d Doctoral Seminar of the Center for Migration Law held in Oberdorf (Switzerland) on 30 November and 1 December 2012. In the {{presentation}} (in German), Charlotte Sieber-Gasser argues {{that there is}} a direct link between regional labour market integration, economic development and migration pressure. The link consists of the impact of labour market integration on added-value production: Through more added-value production in the global South, economic development in the region is more sustainable, jobs are created and brain drain is to a certain extent reversed. As this is acknowledged also by developing countries, more and more regional labour market integration measures emerge in the global South. These newer forms of regulation of the movement of labour is in some cases relatively unique and innovative. Charlotte Sieber-Gasser presents five examples of such newer regulation. The different models range from liberalisation restricted to high skilled labour and indirect liberalisation through the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> to relatively far reaching liberalisation for particular groups of professionals and their families, also covering low skilled labour...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} some significant {{issues on the}} recognition of electronic signatures with regard to foreign certificates {{from the perspective of}} German, French and Polish law. The European Union legislation applies to Germany and France, and has served as a guide for Polish legislation in the course of preparations of the accession of Poland to the European Union. There are therefore strong similarities between the legislation of these countries, but as the French example shows, the results may also differ with regard to the material law applicable to a contract. The difference between simple and advanced electronic signature is discussed within the context of French law. This article elaborates on conditions of recognition of electronic signatures and the relevance of such recognition for the legal systems of the Germany, France and Poland. It seems that the Electronic Signature Directive has been successfully implemented, and provides for clear recognition criteria within the European Union. The <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> from third countries depends on the fulfillment of the criteria set out in the Directive. The Polish law provides for a special position of European Union based suppliers of certificates in terms of their recognition...|$|E

40|$|While PKI {{has had its}} {{difficulties}} (like {{most new}} technologies) the unique value of public key authentication in paperless transactions is now widely acknowledged. The naïve early vision of a single all-purpose identity system {{has given way to}} a more sophisticated landscape of multiple PKIs, used not for managing identity per se, but rather more subtle memberships, credentials and so on. It is well known that PKI’s successes have mostly been in closed schemes. Until now, this fact was often regarded as a compromise; many held out hope that a bigger general purpose PKI would still eventuate. But I argue that the dominance of closed PKI over open is better understood as reflecting the reality of identity plurality, which independently is becoming the norm through the Laws of Identity and related frameworks. This paper introduces the term “Public Key Superstructure ” to describe a new approach to knitting together existing mature PKI components to improve the utility and strategic appeal of digital certificates. The “superstructure ” draws on useful precedents in the security printing industry for manufacturing specialized security goods without complicated or un-natural liabilities, and international accreditation arrangements for achieving cross-border <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates.</b> The model rests on a crucial reimagining of certificates as standing for relationships rather than identities. This elegant re-interpretation of otherwise standard elements could truly be a paradigm shift for PKI, for it normalizes digital certificates, grounding them in familiar, even mundane management processes. It will bring profound yet easily realized benefits for liability, cost, interoperability, scalability, accreditation, and governance...|$|E

50|$|This {{became an}} issue in the 1929 provincial election, {{ultimately}} resulting in a coalition government led by James Thomas Milton Anderson of the Conservatives after the Liberals failed to form a minority government. The Ku Klux Klan would appear at many election rallies for James Garfield Gardiner, burning crosses. Gardiner accused Anderson and the Conservatives of being associated with the Ku Klux Klan or seeking its support, but never provided proof. Klan membership included Conservatives, Liberals, and Progressives, and the provincial treasurer ("Klabee") was Walter Davy Cowan, Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament for Long Lake during the 17th Canadian Parliament from 1930 to 1935. Once they formed the government, the Conservatives condemned the Ku Klux Klan, but their opponents persisted in linking them to the organization until the 1934 provincial election. The Conservative government amended the School Act to ban the display of religious insignia in educational settings, and also amended the provincial immigration policy. The government also terminated <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> teaching <b>certificates</b> granted by Quebec, effectively halting the recruitment of teachers from that province.|$|R
