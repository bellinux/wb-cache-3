The filtration effect of <b>runoff</b> <b>waters</b> by the reservoir structure can decrease the pollutant concentrations of about 64 % for suspended solids and 79 % for lead.

25|$|Not {{only did}} the weather {{frustrate}} efforts to reach the scene, but also it hampered the ability to fight the fire.

25|$|Rust {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of bridge accidents. As rust has a much higher volume than the {{originating}} mass of iron, its build-up can also cause failure by forcing apart adjacent parts. It was the cause of the collapse of the Mianus river bridge in 1983, when the bearings rusted internally and pushed one corner of the road slab off its support. Three drivers on the roadway at the time died as the slab fell into the river below. The following NTSB investigation showed that a drain in the road had been blocked for road re-surfacing, and had not been unblocked; as a result, <b>runoff</b> <b>water</b> penetrated the support hangers. Rust was also an important factor in the Silver Bridge disaster of 1967 in West Virginia, when a steel suspension bridge collapsed within a minute, killing 46 drivers and passengers on the bridge at the time.|$|E
25|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} {{are designed}} to remove stormwater pollutants associated with fine to colloidal particles and dissolved contaminants. These shallow, extensively vegetated water bodies use enhanced sedimentation, fine filtration and biological uptake to remove these pollutants. They usually comprise three zones: an inlet zone (sedimentation basin) to remove coarse sediments; a macrophyte zone, a heavily vegetated area to remove fine particulates and uptake of soluble pollutants; and a high flow bypass channel to protect the macrophyte zone. The macrophyte zone generally includes a marsh zone {{as well as an}} open water zone and has an extended depth of 0.25 to 0.5m with specialist plant species and a retention time of 48 to 72 hours. Constructed Wetlands can also provide a flow control function by rising during rainfall and then slowly releasing the stored flows. Constructed wetlands will improve the <b>runoff</b> <b>water</b> quality depending on the wetland processes. The key treatment mechanism of wetlands are physical (trapping suspended solids and adsorbed pollutants), biological and chemical uptake (trapping dissolved pollutants, chemical adsorption of pollutants), and pollutant transformation (more stable sediment fixation, microbial processes, UV disinfection).|$|E

40|$|International audienceGeotextiles {{are thin}} {{polymeric}} materials {{widely used in}} geotechnical, environmental and hydraulic applications. They are employed in infiltration basins designed to collect and {{improve the quality of}} storm and <b>runoff</b> <b>waters</b> before their infiltration into the surrounding soil. The introduction of geotextiles in the subsoil of infiltration basins may significantly influence the flow and transfer of pollutants present in storm and <b>runoff</b> <b>waters</b> in solute form or associated with colloidal and particulate phases. The objective of this work was to study the influence of a nonwoven geotextile on conservative solute and colloidal transport through sandy and gravel porous media under both saturated and unsaturated conditions. Solute and colloid transport through columns containing soil amended with a geotextile were characterized by injecting a tracer solution and a suspension of colloidal particles at a constant flow rate under saturated and unsaturated conditions. The flow pattern was described using a MIM model implemented with the HYDRUS 1 D code. The results showed that nonwoven geotextiles can increase flow homogeneity. Their effect on flow homogenization depended on soil heterogeneity and the degree of water saturation. Colloidal retention efficiency at column scale was also modified by the presence of geotextiles. By homogenizing flow they increased the filter capacity of the soil, thereby decreasing the pollutant transfer in colloidal form...|$|R
25|$|Porous paving (or {{pervious}} paving) is {{an alternative}} to conventional impermeable pavement and allows infiltration of <b>runoff</b> <b>water</b> to the soil or to a dedicated water storage reservoir below it In reasonably flat areas such as car parks, driveways and lightly used roads, it decreases the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff and can improve water quality by removing contaminants through filtering, interception and biological treatment. Porous pavements can have several forms and are either monolithic or modular. Monolithic structures consist of a single continuous porous medium such as porous concrete or porous pavement (asphalt) while modular structures include porous pavers individual paving blocks that are constructed {{so that there is}} a gap in between each paver. Commercial products that are available are for example, pavements made from special asphalt or concrete containing minimal materials, concrete grid pavements, and concrete ceramic or plastic modular pavements. Porous pavements are usually laid on a very porous material (sand or gravel), underlain by a layer of geotextile material. Maintenance activities vary {{depending on the type of}} porous pavement. Generally, inspections and removal of sediment and debris should be undertaken. Modulate pavers can also be lifted, backwashed and replaced when blockages occurs. Generally porous pavement is not suited for areas with heavy traffic loads. Particulates in stormwater can clog pores in the material.|$|E
500|$|A {{combination}} of the rainfall and geology leads to an estimated average daily runoff from springs and boreholes of some 330,000m3 (72million imperial gallons). Bristol Waterworks Company (now Bristol Water) recognised {{the value of this}} resource and between 1846 and 1853 created a series of underground tunnels, pipes, and aqueducts called the [...] "Line of Works", which still carry approximately 18,200m3 (4million imperial gallons) of water a day to Barrow Gurney Reservoirs for filtration and then on to Bristol and the surrounding areas. This collection and conveyance of water from the Chewton Mendip and East and West Harptree areas is accomplished by the effect of gravity on the <b>runoff.</b> <b>Water</b> from the Mendips is also collected in Cheddar Reservoir, which was constructed in the 1930s and takes water from the springs in Cheddar Gorge.|$|E
500|$|Once, profuse runs of {{anadromous}} fish—salmon, steelhead, and others—migrated up the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers {{to spawn}} in great numbers.

From north to south, the Sacramento upriver of Shasta Dam, the American upriver of Folsom Dam, the Stanislaus upriver of New Melones Dam, and the San Joaquin upriver of Mendota—have become inaccessible to migrating salmon. In three of these cases, it is because the dams are too high and their reservoirs too large for fish to bypass via fish ladders. The San Joaquin River, however, had a different fate.

Even downstream of Mendota, where the Delta-Mendota Canal gives the river a new surge of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, irrigation <b>runoff</b> <b>water,</b> contaminated with pesticides and fertilizer, has caused the river to become heavily polluted.
