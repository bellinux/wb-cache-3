5|$|Initial {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in September 1954. No alpha decay was seen from mendelevium atoms; thus, Ghiorso suggested that the mendelevium had all decayed by electron capture to fermium and that the experiment should be repeated to search instead for spontaneous fission events. The <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiment happened in February 1955.|$|E
5|$|Note that {{original}} North American Reprise Records pressings of Aqualung contained a slightly edited {{version of the}} title song, with its first three seconds (i.e., the first <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song's signature riff) removed. These pressings correspondingly list the song's length at 6:31.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the investigation, lines of {{communication}} were set up between the Navy and the Air Force. The Air Force knew nothing of Operation Market Time and did not routinely communicate with Naval Forces, Vietnam. To avoid a <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident, aircraft patrolling near the DMZ were instructed not to attack vessels without first contacting CSC Da Nang for clearance.|$|E

30|$|All {{values were}} {{expressed}} as means ± standard deviations and statistical significance was accepted at p <  0.05 using a two tailed, unpaired, t-test for independent samples. Correlations were assessed through the Pearson’s coefficient. Subsequently, a pull–push ratio was calculated dividing <b>the</b> number or <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LPD test with <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CP test (LPD/CP). Statistical {{analyses were performed}} through “Statistica 10.0 for Windows (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA)”.|$|R
5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{the monastic}} traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions {{resulted}} in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East. Hesychasm involves the <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages {{at different times}} and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} {{operator}} chose the message setting KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} setting, which might be GBL on that particular day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{as he did}} {{incidents}} {{in the order of}} their occurrence without any of the historian's pretensions to a thematic organization of his material, he could not feed back the lessons of a changing present into a reinterpreted past.

50|$|Alternatively {{the chain}} method {{can be used}} with the NPV method under the {{assumption}} that the projects will be replaced with the same cash flows each time. To compare projects of unequal length, say 3 years and 4 years, the projects are chained together, i.e. four <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3-year project are compare to three <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4-year project. The chain method and the EAC method give mathematically equivalent answers.|$|R

5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} {{relies on the}} memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the memory of a bad experience attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E
5|$|Language {{assessment}} {{will allow}} the recognition of medical conditions presenting with aphonia or dysarthria, neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with aphasia, and specific language disorders such as stuttering, cluttering or mutism. People with autism or Asperger syndrome may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of their speech. Echolalia (repetition of another person's words) and palilalia (<b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject's own words) can be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms, which are made-up words which have a specific meaning to the person using them.|$|E
5|$|One {{contentious}} {{point in}} Denholm-Young's article was his assertion {{that there was}} no mention of the Provisions of Oxford in the Mise of Lewes. This was an idea that John Maddicott strongly contested in an 1983 article. According to Maddicott, the provisions had been at the centre of Montfort's opposition over the last six years, and it was unlikely that he would give them up so easily. Nevertheless, Montfort showed willingness to negotiate the terms of the provisions. As such, the Mise of Lewes was a moderate document; Montfort wanted to avoid a <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation after the Mise of Amiens. Rather it was external circumstances outside of Montfort's control that led to the eventual failure of the negotiations between the royalists and the barons.|$|E

5|$|Tiku {{eventually}} {{formed an}} alliance with nearby Buginese leaders, which reduced tensions and improved trade; he also learned the group's writing system and language, allowing him to easily correspond with Buginese leaders. By this time Tiku had captured numerous lands. To avoid a <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raze of Tondon, Tiku began construction of seven fortresses in his lands, {{as well as several}} surveillance outposts and storeholds. The Torajan fortresses were designed to prevent entry to the valleys leading to population centres, and Tiku's were divided between the eastern and western parts of his land. He instituted a tax system to fund these defensive measures: owners of rice fields were obligated to tax two thirds of their produce, while other farmers were taxed ten per cent.|$|E
5|$|Unprecedented {{security}} measures {{were made by}} the Turkish government to safeguard the NATO summit from terrorist attacks. They especially feared a <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Istanbul bombings of 2003 that killed more than 60 people. Their fear was proven by the arrest of 16 people in Bursa in early May on suspicion of planning to bomb the summit. Police seized guns, explosives, bomb-making booklets and 4,000 compact discs with training advice from Osama Bin Laden, and believed that the suspects were members of the radical Islamic group Ansar al-Islam, thought to be linked with al-Qaeda. On June 24 two bombs also exploded. One bomb went off in a bus in Istanbul killing 4 people (including the bomber), the other outside a hotel in Ankara where US president George W. Bush would be staying. Additionally, on June 25, explosives were found in a parked car at Istanbul's main airport.|$|E
5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new word back to the adult. When a child begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E

5|$|At the Tour de Corse, Audi debuted the Quattro A2, {{which was}} 70kg (155lb) lighter {{and had an}} engine {{producing}} 30 more horsepower. Mouton's rally ended when her engine caught on fire. On the first stage in Greece, she rolled her car on a hairpin turn 18km (11mi) from the start. Rally New Zealand was for Mouton a <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous year; she took the lead on the seventh stage and held on to it until her A2's engine failed, with only six of the 33 stages to go. The three retirements in a row dropped Mouton to fifth place in the championship. She then finished third behind Mikkola and Blomqvist at the Rally Argentina, but this would remain her last podium finish of the season. At the 1000 Lakes in Finland, Mouton finished the first day in seventh place after setting two top-five stage times. Her car later caught on fire, but {{she was able to}} continue in the event by following Mikkola's advice and driving into a lake. With a string of top-ten times, she eventually finished 16th. In the Rallye Sanremo, the tarmac stages were dominated by the Lancia 037 and Mouton finished seventh after suffering from fuel injection problems. In the season-ending RAC Rally, she started well and held second place after the first twelve stages. An Audi mechanic later accidentally refilled Mouton's fuel tank with pure water which resulted in time-consuming repairs. She eventually retired after crashing out, and placed fifth overall in the drivers' championship. Although Mikkola beat Lancia's Röhrl and Alén to the drivers' title, Audi had lost the manufacturers' title to Lancia after the latter's triple win in Sanremo.|$|E
5|$|Bagramyan's 11th Guards Army (the renamed 16th Army) was tasked to {{take part}} in the {{offensive}} and was given an additional three infantry divisions and two tank corps, a force composed of fifteen divisions. Bagramyan, however, argued to STAVKA that its planning was too audacious in the hopes of repeating a successful encirclement like that in Uranus. He claimed that his forces would be overstretched and would have difficulty in attacking the entrenched German positions in Bolkhov. To avoid a <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failure in Kharkov the previous year, he instead asked that the 61st Army from the Bryansk Front aid his 11th Guards in destroying the German forces in Bolkhov, thus eliminating the Ninth Army's protection from the north. He appealed to his front commander Vasily Sokolovsky as well the Bryansk's M. A. Reyter, both of whom rejected his proposal. In April, STAVKA recalled the main commanders of the Fronts and Armies to Moscow on a briefing of the preparations for the battle. Against the protestations of Sokolovsky and Reyter, Bagramyan proposed his alternative plan to Stalin, who agreed that it would be the more correct course to follow. Bagramyan was given twenty days to prepare the 11th Guards Army and on 24 May reported that his forces were ready. The 11th Guards now was composed of 135,000 men, 280 armored fighting vehicles, 2,700 artillery pieces and several hundred planes to lend air support for the ground forces. Stalin, however, felt it necessary to further wear thin the fighting abilities of the German forces and delayed the offensive.|$|E
