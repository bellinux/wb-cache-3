5000|$|Giving {{evidence}} to the inquiry on 29 January 2010 Blair addressed the interview, saying {{that it had been}} recorded in July 2009, some months before the inquiry convened, and he admitted that it had been a mistake to say he would have got <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> {{regardless of whether or not}} he had WMD. He told the inquiry he [...] "did not use the words regime change in that interview", and that what he had meant was that he [...] "couldn't describe the nature of the threat in the same way if you knew then what you know now". Blair's performance was later condemned by families of military personnel killed in Iraq as disrespectful.|$|E

He responded to such criticism on 21 February 2007 by saying [...] "The whole cabinet believed the intelligence we were presented with and we made our case to the British people based on it in good faith. As we all now know, that intelligence was wholly wrong. We will be judged historically as to whether getting <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> despite all the consequences, was a positive thing or that the consequences outweigh the positives {{of getting rid of}} a brutal tyrant." ...|$|E
