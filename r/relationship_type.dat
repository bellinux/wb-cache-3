Pedagogical <b>relationship</b> <b>types</b> are used to define adaptation strategies {{which can be used}} by an adaptation engine to create an adaptive course based on user model information. Based on domain models consisting of concepts and relationships between concepts, pedagogical relationships can be used to connect concepts of domain models in a pedagogical meaningful way. Each <b>type</b> of these <b>relationships</b> contains adaptation code which formally specifies the meaning of relationships on a technical and a pedagogical level. To support authors in creating these <b>relationship</b> <b>types</b> a tool is being developed which easily allows the authoring process...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWith the {{increasing}} popularity of information sharing {{and the growing}} number of social network users, relationship management {{is one of the key}} challenges which arise in the context of social networks. One particular relationship management task aims at identifying <b>relationship</b> <b>types</b> that are relevant between social network users and their contacts. Manually identifying <b>relationship</b> <b>types</b> is one possible solution, however it is a time-consuming and tedious task that requires constant maintenance. In this paper, we present a rule-based approach that sets the focus on published photos as a valuable source to identify <b>relationship</b> <b>types.</b> Our approach automatically generates relevant relationship discovery rules based on a crowdsourcing methodology that constructs useful photo datasets. Knowledge is first retrieved from these datasets and then used to create relationship discovery rules. The obtained set of rules is extended using a number of predefined common sense rules and then personalized using a rule mining algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the correctness and the efficiency of the generated sets of rules to identify <b>relationship</b> <b>types.</b> (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The <b>relationship</b> <b>type</b> infants {{establish}} {{with their}} primary caregiver can predict {{the course of}} their relationships and connections throughout their lives. Those who are securely attached have high self-esteem, seek out social connection and support and are able to share their feelings with other people.They also tend to have long-term, trusting relationships. Secure attachment has been shown to act as a buffer to determinants of health among preschoolers, including stress and poverty. One study supports that women with a secure attachment style had more positive feelings with regard to their adult relationships than women with insecure attachment styles. Within an adult romantic relationship, secure attachment can mean both people engage in close, bodily contact, disclose information with one another, share discoveries with each other and feel safe when the other is nearby.|$|E
50|$|An individual's mood {{has been}} known to distort {{cognitive}} abilities. Emotions cloud rational quick thoughts. The three most influential studies were conducted in 2002 by Nalini Ambady and Heather M. Gray. In the first study, induced sadness led to reduced accuracy in judgments of teacher effectiveness from brief samples of nonverbal behavior. In the second study, sad participants showed reduced accuracy in judging <b>relationship</b> <b>type</b> from thin-slices as well as diminished judgmental efficiency. The third study showed the possibility that sadness impairs accuracy by promoting a more deliberative information-processing style. All of these studies have the basic principle that emotions do in fact affect judgement as seen through effects on thin-slicing. They disprove conclusions from some previous studies that sadness would lead to more cautious processing strategy or would not have a strong effect in social perception, and argue that short-term induced sadness would hinder individual's social interpretation skills.|$|E

40|$|Background : This special {{collection}} {{is the result}} of a collaboration between a group of family scholars from Europe and the United States. It initially developed from the observation that in many Western countries new <b>types</b> of couple <b>relationships</b> have emerged alongside marriage (i. e., cohabitation and living-apart-together [LAT] relationships). Although the trend seems universal, it is likely that the prevalence of different <b>relationship</b> <b>types,</b> and their outcomes in particular, vary across countries. Countries differ in how they institutionalize and confer meaning on new <b>relationship</b> <b>types.</b> Such differences may have important implications for how couples behave and organize their daily lives, in turn affecting the well-being of family members. The articles in this special collection aim to understand the organization and relationship outcomes ofcohabitation, marriage, and LAT relationships across countries. Contribution : Although there has been an upsurge in cross-national research on new <b>relationship</b> <b>types,</b> most studies focus on cohabitation and less so on LAT relationships. In addition, most studies examine how new <b>relationship</b> <b>types</b> differ from marriage in demographic aspects (e. g., childbearing, union stability) or in terms of family members' well-being. Little cross-national evidence exists about differences with regard to how couples negotiate and give form to their relationship in their daily lives, or about dimensions that go beyond the relationship itself, such as people's relationships with their larger family. This special collection contributes to the existing body of knowledge by studying new relationships from a comparative perspective, looking at LAT relationships as well as cohabitation, and examining how couples differ from each other on relationship dimensions that have been relatively understudied...|$|R
