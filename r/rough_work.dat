5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Lindow Man was a healthy male in his mid-20s, {{and he may have}} been someone of high status, as his body shows little {{evidence}} of heavy or <b>rough</b> <b>work.</b> There has been debate over the reason for Lindow Man's death, for the nature of his demise was violent, perhaps ritualistic; after a last meal of charred bread, Lindow Man was strangled, hit on the head, and his throat cut. Dating the body has proven problematic, but it is thought that Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss, face down, some time between 2 BC and 119AD, in either the Iron Age or Romano-British period. The body has been preserved by freeze-drying and is on permanent display at the British Museum, although it occasionally travels to other venues such as the Manchester Museum.|$|E
25|$|The {{examination}} is of 3 hours duration, {{and contains}} {{a total of}} 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onward, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of both multiple choice questions (four answer options out of which the correct {{one has to be}} chosen) and numerical answer type questions (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse). Candidates are provided with scribble pads for <b>rough</b> <b>work</b> and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.|$|E
25|$|Polishing wheels {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of types to fulfil a wide range of needs. The most common {{materials}} used for polishing wheels are wood, leather, canvas, cotton cloth, plastic, felt, paper, sheepskin, impregnated rubber, canvas composition, and wool; leather and canvas are the most common. Wooden wheels have emery or other abrasives glued onto them and are used to polish flat surfaces and maintained good edges. There are many types of cloth wheels. Cloth wheels that are cemented together are very hard and used for <b>rough</b> <b>work,</b> whereas other cloth wheels that are sewn and glued together are not as aggressive. There are cloth wheels that are not glued or cemented, instead these are sewed and have metal side plates for support. Solid felt wheels are popular for fine finishes. Hard roughing wheels can be made by cementing together strawboard paper disks. Softer paper wheels are made from felt paper. Most wheels are run at approximately 7500 surface feet per minute (SFM), however muslin, felt and leather wheels are usually run at 4000 SFM.|$|E

Hanna organized, built coalitions, performed the <b>rougher</b> <b>work</b> for which McKinley had neither taste nor energy.

500|$|In life, Lindow Man {{would have}} {{measured}} between 5'6" [...] and 5'8" [...] (1.68 and 1.73m) tall and weighed about [...] It {{was possible to}} ascertain that his age at death was around the mid-20s. The body retains a trimmed beard, moustache, and sideburns of brown hair, as well as healthy teeth with no visible cavities, and manicured fingernails, indicating he did little heavy or <b>rough</b> <b>work.</b> Apart from a fox-fur armband, Lindow Man was discovered completely naked. When he died, Lindow Man was suffering from slight osteoarthritis and an infestation of whipworm and maw worm. As a result of decalcification of the bones and pressure from the peat under which Lindow Man was buried, his skull was distorted. While some preserved human remains may contain DNA, peat bogs such as Lindow Moss are generally poor for such a purpose, and {{it is unlikely that}} DNA could be recovered from Lindow Man.|$|E
500|$|Between February and April 1890 Van Gogh {{suffered}} a severe relapse. Depressed {{and unable to}} bring himself to write, he {{was still able to}} paint and draw a little during this time, and he later wrote to Theo that he had made a few small canvases [...] "from memory... reminisces of the North". Among these was Two Peasant Women Digging in a Snow-Covered Field at Sunset. Hulsker believes that this small group of paintings formed the nucleus of many drawings and study sheets depicting landscapes and figures that Van Gogh worked on during this time. He comments that this short period was the only time that Van Gogh's illness had a significant effect on his work. Van Gogh asked his mother and his brother to send him drawings and <b>rough</b> <b>work</b> he had done in the early 1880s so he could work on new paintings from his old sketches. Belonging to this period is Sorrowing Old Man ("At Eternity's Gate"), a colour study Hulsker describes as [...] "another unmistakable remembrance of times long past". [...] His late paintings show an artist {{at the height of his}} abilities, according to the art critic Robert Hughes, [...] "longing for concision and grace".|$|E

Mrs. Hollis did not much like having her about, but, as Grace said, one or other of them always had an eye upon her, and she was only there for a couple of hours in the morning.|$|R
2500|$|Joseph Luster of Otaku USA {{noted that}} the story is typical for its time, but said that this [...] "is overshadowed by its bold, filmic execution" [...] {{as well as its}} insight into Tatsumi's early career. Katherine Dacey of Manga Bookshelf found the art's anatomy lacking, but complimented its {{characterization}} and composition, concluding that the manga has [...] "a vital, improvisatory energy missing from Tatsumi's later period". Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics liked the manga's tense situations, but felt that the second half was slow with a weak ending, and said that Tatsumi's art is [...] "blocky and crude in places, but there's an energy about it that helps propel those early pages forward." [...] Connie C. of Comic Book Resources described it as a [...] "very straightforward crime story, [...] is well told, but doesn't get much more elaborate", but called it a [...] "beautiful example" [...] of a pulp short story. Tom Spurgeon called the manga [...] "a fun but <b>rough</b> <b>work,</b> full of character types and situations entirely too on the nose to reflect the nuances of certain moral questions brought to bear", especially disliking the ending and saying of the art: [...] "the best scenes in Black Blizzard have a physical immediacy that only arises from fundamentally solid cartooning with a corresponding attention to movement". Publishers Weekly called the story and layouts simple, and the art sometimes crude, but [...] "with a cinematic use of perspective, intensified via the characters and their circumstances, Tatsumi constructs a thrilling narrative with emotional depth." [...] Michelle Smith of Comic Book Resources said that the manga is [...] "a quick and fun hard-boiled adventure yarn", feeling that the story was [...] "silly" [...] and Shinpei's connection [...] "too convenient", but complimenting the [...] "fast-paced narrative" [...] and finding the rough art to suit the characters. The A.V. Club described the manga as a [...] "head-spinning blur of hardboiled suspense", likening the climax to Mickey Spillane's work, and calling Tatsumi's early art [...] "necessarily loose and frantic". Shawn O'Rourke of PopMatters compared the story's nervous tension to EC Comics stories and said that the art [...] "while simplistic, conveys a depth and nuance that engages the reader", adding that [...] "unwieldy exposition or narrative declarations" [...] are avoided, and that the manga [...] "is still eminently enjoyable in a way that so many of dated classics of that era are not." [...] ICv2 said that [...] "Tatsumi skillfully uses the conventions of the crime story to examine his characters who come from very different social backgrounds", calling Black Blizzard [...] "one of the first examples of the realistic, socially conscious, and adult (in the best sense of the term) gekiga genre of manga." [...] Deb Aoki of About.com said of the manga: [...] "while not as polished as his later works, this one-shot crackles with youthful energy, cinematic style, and Tatsumi's burning desire to push the boundaries of manga beyond kids stuff." ...|$|E

50|$|Carpentry {{is one of}} the {{traditional}} trades but is not always clearly distinguished from the work of the joiner and cabinetmaker, in general a carpenter historically did the heavier, <b>rougher</b> <b>work</b> of framing a building including installing the sheathing and sub-flooring and installing pre-made doors and windows. Joiners did the finer work of installing trim and paneling. Plank and board are not consistently defined in history. Sometimes these terms are used synonymously. Board means a piece of lumber (timber) 1/2 in to 1.5 in thick and more than 4 in wide. Plank generally means a piece of lumber (timber) rectangular in shape and thicker than a board.|$|R

60|$|Kenwyne felt pleasantly languid as he lounged in a basket-chair {{after his}} evening meal. He had been back-setting land since daybreak. Holding the plow was an {{occupation}} almost {{unknown to the}} Allenwood settlers, who left all the <b>rougher</b> <b>work</b> to their hired men. Kenwyne, however, was of a practical turn of mind; and, having invested all his money in his farm, he meant to get some return. He occasionally enjoyed a run with the coyote hounds, or a day's shooting when the migrating geese and ducks rested among the sloos; {{but for the most}} part he stuck steadily to his work and, as he bought the latest implements, he was considered richer than he really was. Though thirty, he was unmarried; an elderly Scottish housekeeper looked after him.|$|R
50|$|The wide {{selection}} of brick styles and types generally available in industrialized nations allow much variety in {{the appearance of the}} final product. In buildings built during the 1950s-1970s, a high degree of uniformity of brick and accuracy in masonry was typical. In the period since then this style was thought to be too sterile, so attempts were made to emulate older, <b>rougher</b> <b>work.</b> Some brick surfaces are made to look particularly rustic by including burnt bricks, which have a darker color or an irregular shape. Others may use antique salvage bricks, or new bricks may be artificially aged by applying various surface treatments, such as tumbling. The attempts at rusticity of the late 20th century have been carried forward by masons specializing in a free, artistic style, where the courses are intentionally not straight, instead weaving to form more organic impressions.|$|R

60|$|Pittsburg and Alleghany--which {{latter is}} a town similar in its nature to Pittsburg, {{on the other side}} of the river of the same name--regard {{themselves}} as places apart; but they are in effect one and the same city. They live under the same blanket of soot, which is woven by the joint efforts of the two places. Their united population is 135,000, of which Alleghany owns about 50,000. The industry of the towns is of that sort which arises from a union of coal and iron in the vicinity. The Pennsylvanian coal fields are the most prolific in the Union; and Pittsburg is therefore great, exactly as Merthyr-Tydvil and Birmingham are great. But the foundery work at Pittsburg is more nearly allied to the heavy, <b>rough</b> <b>works</b> of the Welsh coal metropolis than to the finish and polish of Birmingham.|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} day two of Zikali's servants who did the <b>rougher</b> <b>work</b> of my sick room, if I may so call it, arrived {{and said that they}} were going to carry me out of the cave for a while, if that were my will. I who longed to breathe the fresh air again, said that it was very much my will, whereon they grasped the rough bedstead which I have described by either end and very carefully bore me down the cave and through its narrow entrance, where they set the bedstead in the shadow of the overhanging rock without. When I had recovered a little, for even that short journey tired me, I looked about me and perceived that as I had expected, I was in the Black Kloof, for there in front of me were the very huts which we had occupied on our arrival from Swazi-Land.|$|R

All the time he had been at Mr. Dutton's he had been {{depressed}} and anxious, but now, with his boy on his knee, he was merrier than Nuttie had ever known him. As to exercise, there were delightful evening walks, sometimes early marketings in the long summer mornings before business began--and altogether it seemed, as Nuttie told her father afterwards, as if she had had a glimpse into a little City Arcadia.|$|R
