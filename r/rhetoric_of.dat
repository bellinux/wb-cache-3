5|$|The {{concept of}} Żydokomuna was widely {{illustrated}} in Polish interwar politics, including publications by the National Democrats and the Catholic Church that expressed anti-Jewish views.

Daniel quickly tires of the radical Puritan <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> his father, Drake Waterhouse, and decides to join Reverend John Wilkins and Robert Hooke at John Comstock's Epsom estate.|$|E

40|$|Empathy {{has been}} {{commonly}} evoked within rhetoric and composition {{as a way}} to understand audiences and as a classroom ethic. This dissertation goes further in defining <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy, analyzing the uses <b>of</b> <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy in political and social discourse, and proposing how <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy might inform the ways we teach reading and writing. The first chapter defines <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy through a survey of empathy 2 ̆ 7 s place in the rhetorical tradition, including Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s theories of emotion, ideas of compassion in the Scottish Enlightenment, and Kenneth Burke 2 ̆ 7 s concept of identification. This rhetorical history is combined with contemporary understandings of empathy from developmental psychology and moral philosophy. The resulting definition is <b>of</b> <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy as means of persuasion notable for combining the cognitive and the affective within our perspective-taking faculties, social relations, and moral judgments. The importance <b>of</b> <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy in political discourse is shown in an analysis of Barack Obama 2 ̆ 7 s speeches, which both promote and perform positions of empathy. Obama 2 ̆ 7 s speeches are further shown to employ empathy through allegory, particularly in the telling of Obama 2 ̆ 7 s own story as an occasion for empathizing with multiple American identities. A series of first-person accounts of the nearly and newly homeless from the Las Vegas Sun are used to illustrate the contested conditions <b>of</b> <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy based upon readings of suffering, victimhood, and the overlap between self and other. An argument then is made for composition pedagogies that work with empathy as rhetorical appeal and as a disposition that can be cultivated through habits of reading and writing. The proposed pedagogies include an attention to perspective-taking and the perceived human reality of issues. They also require an awareness that empathy is always at best an approximation, one inherently tied to differences in experiences and social relations. This dissertation maintains at the end that <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy are valuable precisely because of the paradoxical questions they foreground, those of the cognitive and the affective, our relationships and responsibilities to one another, and the critical necessity of recognizing our always present differences alongside a shared humanity...|$|R
5|$|Wollstonecraft did not {{employ the}} formal argumentation or logical prose style common to 18th-century {{philosophical}} writing when composing her own works. The Rights of Woman {{is a long}} essay that introduces all of its major topics in the opening chapters and then repeatedly returns to them, each time from {{a different point of}} view. It also adopts a hybrid tone that combines rational argument with the fervent <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> sensibility.|$|E
5|$|During Modi's {{second term}} the <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> the {{government}} shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development. Modi curtailed {{the influence of}} Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP. Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a forward to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.|$|E
5|$|In many districts Taiwanese aborigines tend to {{vote for}} the Kuomintang, {{to the point that the}} {{legislative}} seats allocated to the aborigines are popularly described as iron votes for the pan-blue coalition. This may seem surprising in light of the focus of the pan-green coalition on promoting aboriginal culture as part of the Taiwanese nationalist discourse against the KMT. However, this voting pattern can be explained on economic grounds, and as part of an inter-ethnic power struggle waged in the electorate. Some aborigines see the <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> Taiwan nationalism as favoring the majority Hoklo speakers rather than themselves. Aboriginal areas also tend to be poor and their economic vitality tied to the entrenched patronage networks established by the Kuomintang over the course of its fifty-five year reign.|$|E

5|$|The <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> the French Revolution {{inspired}} many Irishmen {{to fight}} for similar principles of liberty, equality, and brotherhood in their own nation; liberty in this context largely meant independence from Great Britain. With these goals in mind, in 1791 Dublin lawyer Wolfe Tone founded the Society of United Irishmen. Allying itself with the French Republic, the society was suppressed by the British authorities and forced to go underground when war broke out between France and Great Britain in 1793. Tone and other members secretly travelled to France to convince the French National Convention to invade Ireland. Such an invasion, they argued, could rely on support from large numbers of Irish irregulars, and if successful would strike a severe blow to the British war effort—perhaps even severe enough to force Britain to seek peace.|$|E
5|$|Writing in {{the journal}} Social Problems, Jessica Fields {{characterized}} Not in Front of the Children as a significant monograph which effectively criticized the <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> protection of the sexual purity of youths {{as a form of}} ideology. Cynthia A. McDaniel wrote in a piece for the journal Counterpoints assessing that Heins had put forth a thesis that attempting to shield youths from events led to negative unintended consequences. McDaniel emphasized that rationale debate is key to a functional society which values freedom of choice. She wrote that debate and introspection were critical to growth in this area, {{in order to determine the}} need to modify behavior patterns.|$|E
