40|$|First, we analyze how regular {{days off}} from {{competition}} and a time-dependent price pattern affect firm performance. Second, {{we examine the}} effects on firms' profitability from consumers’ changing search- and timing behavior. We use microdata from gasoline retailing in Norway. Since 2004, firms have practiced an industry-wide day off from competition, starting on Mondays at noon, by increasing prices to a common level given by the <b>recommended</b> <b>prices</b> (decided and published in advance). Hence, firms know when and to what level to raise their price. In areas without local competition, retail prices are always equal to the <b>recommended</b> <b>prices.</b> Hinged on this, we regard <b>recommended</b> <b>prices</b> as the monopoly price level. In turn, a foreseeable low-price window is open before every restoration. During the data period, we observe an additional weekly restoration on Thursdays at noon. We show that an additional day off from competition increases firm performance. As expected, a conventional price search of where to buy reduces firms’ profitability. In contrast, consumers who {{are aware of the}} cycle and spend effort on when to buy {{have a positive impact on}} firms’ profitability. If consumers spend effort on when to buy rather than where to buy, price competition might be softened even in the low-price windows...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} in the economics literature that before-tax prices are not independent of sales-tax rates. This paper shows that a sales-tax imposed in a high tax region can decrease the tax-included price for a buyer in a low tax region who purchases from a seller in the high tax region. Therefore, {{it may be more}} profitable for Internet retailers to be located in high tax regions. An empirical analysis shows that automobile manufacturers in the European Union (EU) set higher before-tax <b>recommended</b> <b>prices</b> for countries with low indirect taxes. This may contribute to the explanation of the flow of Internet automobile sales from high tax countries to low tax countries in the EU...|$|R
