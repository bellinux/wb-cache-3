This means that instead of using a single <b>Radiosonde</b> <b>ascent</b> capturing local data over a short time period, and circulating that information using older formats, such as the Standard Computer Meteorological message (METCM) under STANAG 4082, it provides a grid of data in four dimensions - vertical, two horizontal and time.

The basic premise of the present method is that the oscillations in the ascent rate of the balloon will have the signature of Brunt-Väisälä frequency, which can be retrieved by using sophisticated spectral tools. We employ wavelet transforms {{to arrive at the}} Brunt-Väisälä period profile. Comparison of retrieved Brunt-Väisälä periods with the values derived from the temperature data available from the same <b>radiosonde</b> <b>ascent</b> shows good agreement.

Data from the radiosondes released from Gadanki (13. 5 ° N, 79. 2 ° E), a tropical station in India, have been collected during the ascent and during the descent as well without attaching any parachute or its equivalent since the year 2008. In the present study an attempt {{has been made to}} characterize the radiosonde descent data with the main objective of exploring its usefulness and reliability for scientific purposes. We compared the data obtained during ascent and descent phases of the same sounding. The mean differences in T, RH and horizontal winds between ascent and descent data are found to be small and are sometimes even within the uncertainty of the measurements and/or expected diurnal variation itself. The very good consistency observed between the ascent and the descent data shows that one more profile of the meteorological parameters can be constructed within 3 h of time of balloon launch practically at no additional cost. Further checks are done by utilizing the 3 -hourly radiosonde observations collected during the Tropical Tropopause Dynamics campaigns conducted at Gadanki. In the process of checking the consistency between the <b>radiosonde</b> <b>ascent</b> and descent data, several new findings are arrived at and are reported in this study. In general, it has taken more than half an hour for the balloon to reach the ground from the burst altitude. It is also observed that the fall velocity is close to 10 m s − 1 near the surface.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 110 - 115). The {{propagation of}} the Global Positioning System (GPS) {{signal from the}} satellite to the receiver is affected by, among other factors, the atmosphere through which it passes and, whereas the affects of the ionosphere can be eliminated by the differencing of two transmitted frequencies, the affects of the troposphere remain {{one of the major}} sources of noise in traditional geodetic and positioning applications of GPS. This noise can, however, be turned into a signal for the meteorologist and, by applying suitable constraints and processing strategies, it is possible to estimate the amount of precipitable water vapour (PWV) in the atmosphere. The application of the GPS data for the estimation of PWV in the atmosphere is not a new concept and has been described in numerous publications and reports since the early 1990 's (Bevis et al., 1992, Rocken et al., 1993). This project is, however, an attempt to test the technique using the South African network of permanent GPS base stations. This thesis sets out to answer four fundamental questions: i. In theory, can GPS observations be used to estimate the amount of precipitable water vapour (PWV) in the atmosphere? ii. What permanent GPS networks are being used in other countries around the world for similar applications and how successful are these applications? iii. Can data derived from the South African network of permanent GPS base stations, TrigNet, be used to estimate PWV with sufficient accuracy to be able to supplement the radiosonde upper air measurements of the South African Weather Service (SAWS) ? iv. Is the estimation of PWV as derived from the GPS observations a true reflection of reality using the <b>radiosonde</b> <b>ascent</b> measurements and numerical weather model (NWM) data as a method of independent verification? The primary data sets used to estimate atmospheric PWV at hourly intervals for March 2004 were; i. GPS data derived from the South African network of permanent GPS base stations provided by the Chief Directorate of Surveys and Mapping (CDSM); and ii. Surface meteorological measurements supplied by the South African Weather Service (SAWS). The two independent data sets used to verify and test the technique were; i. Upper air measurements derived from radiosonde ascents provided by the SAWS. These measurements were used to compute Integrated Water Vapour (IWV) and then converted to PWV; and ii. PWV estimates derived from a Numerical Weather Model provided by the Department of Environmental and Geographical Sciences of UCT. By the comparing the estimates of PWV from the three techniques, viz. GPS, radiosonde and NWM, it was found that GPS will meet the accuracy requirements of the meteorologist and could be used to supplement radiosonde measurements for use in numerical weather models...|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{radiosonde}} data, a new method is proposed for predicting tropospheric scintillation effects on slant paths.

First, statistical features of tropospheric turbulence responsible for scintillation are extracted from the analysis of {{a large amount of}} <b>radiosonde</b> <b>ascents.</b> Second, longterm scintillation statistics are inferred from these turbulence characteristics, using the theory of propagation through a turbulent medium. The method is applied to a complete year of radiosonde data measured in Belgium and the predicted scintillation results are compared with measurements carried out on the same year near to the meteorological station. An agreement better than with any other usual prediction method is found. The method yields very accurate predictions of scintillation annual statistics and also adequately represents the seasonal and monthly variability of scintillation.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to infer cloud liquid water path (LWP in kg/m 2) over the ocean from passive microwave measurements of SSM/I. The algorithm to retrieve LWP is based on simulated satellite observations. They are calculated with a radiative transfer model applied to about 3000 <b>radiosonde</b> <b>ascents</b> over the Atlantic Ocean. Since radiosonde observations do not contain direct information about cloud water and ice, these parameters are parameterized based on relative humidity and temperature using modified adiabatic liquid water density profiles. A multiple linear regression {{is applied to the}} simulated radiances and the calculated LWP to derive the algorithm. The retrieval accuracy based on the regression analysis including instrumental noise is 0. 03 kg/m 2. Validation of the LWP-algorithm was pursued through a comparison with measurements of a ground-based 33 GHzmicrowave radiometer on board of R. V. "Poseidon" during the International Cirrus Experiment 1989 at the North Sea (ICE' 89). The LWP values agree within the range of uncertainty caused by the different sampling characteristics of the observing systems. The retrieval accuracy for clear-sky cases determined using colocated METEOSAT data over the North Sea is 0. 037 kg/m 2 and confirms the accuracy estimated from regression analysis for the low liquid water cases. The algorithm was used to derive maps of monthly mean LWP over the Atlantic Ocean. As an example the Octobers of the 5 years 1987 - 1991 were selected to demonstrate the interannual variability of LWP. The results were compared with the cloud water content produced by the climate model ECHAM-T 2 from the Max-Planck-Institut Hamburg. Observations during ICE' 89 were used to check the accuracy of the applied radiative transfer model. Brightness temperatures were calculated from <b>radiosonde</b> <b>ascents</b> launched during the overpass of DMSP-F 8 in cloud-free situations. The channel-dependent differences range from about - 2 to 3 K. The possibility to identify different cloud types using microwave and infrared observations was examined. The main conclusion is that simultaneous microwave and infrared measurements enable the separation of dense cirrus and cirrus with underlying water clouds.

The weather covered by the data sample was predominantly that of clear skies and calm-to-light surface winds associated with well established high-pressure systems. Under these restrictive weather conditions, the study shows that the largest variabilities in temperature and humidity occur during the early morning hours resulting from the effects of direct solar heating of the surface. These rapid changes apparently do not penetrate above approximately 1000 ft. In the late morning hours, the atmosphere appears to become stabilized so that net changes in temperatures and relative humidities at all levels are insignificant even in time periods exceeding three hours.

The most reasonable filtering specifications are determined experimentally; clear-sky filtered observations of SDL are compared with corresponding simulated values.

Simulated clear-sky SDL is about 8 W m 22 more than the measured tropical values. In the subarctic, the simulated clear-sky SDL is less than observed values in the winter and greater than observed values in the summer.

As part of a wider attempt to identify possible causes of climatic change, attention has recently been directed to the absorption and scattering of solar radiation by aerosol, processes which modify the heat balance of the atmosphere and the radiation budget at the earth’s surface.

Within a closure study six different experiments have been defined to find the optimal set of measurements to calculate downward shortwave radiation (DSR) and the SWCRE from the model, and their results have been evaluated under seven different synoptic situations. Four of these experiments are defined to investigate the advantage of including the satellite-based cloud droplet effective radius as additional cloud property. The modeled SWCRE based on satellite retrieved cloud properties has a comparable accuracy to the modeled SWCRE based on ship data. For several cases, an improvement through introducing the satellite-based estimate of effective radius as additional information to the ship based data was found. Due to their different measuring characteristics, however, each dataset shows best results for different atmospheric conditions...|$|R

40|$|Realizing the {{importance}} of aerosol characterization and addressing its spatio-temporal heterogeneities over Bay of Bengal (BoB), campaign mode observations of aerosol parameters were carried out using simultaneous cruise, aircraft and land-based measurements during the Winter Integrated Campaign for Aerosols gases and Radiation Budget (W_ICARB). Under this, airborne measurements of total and hemispheric backscatter coefficients were made over several regions of coastal India and eastern BoB using a three wavelength integrating nephelometer. The measurements include high resolution multi-level (ML) sorties for altitude profiles and bi-level (BL) sorties for spatial gradients within and above the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) over BoB. The vertical profiles of the scattering coefficients are investigated {{in light of the}} information on the vertical structure of the atmospheric stability, which was derived from the collocated GPS (Global Positioning System) aided <b>radiosonde</b> <b>ascents.</b> In general, the altitude profiles revealed that the scattering coefficient remained steady in the convectively well-mixed regions and dropped off above the MABL. This decrease was quite rapid off the Indian mainland, while it was more gradual in the eastern BoB. Investigation on horizontal gradients revealed that the scattering coefficients over northern BoB are 3 to 4 times higher compared to that of central BoB within and above the MABL. A north-south gradient in scattering coefficients is observed over Port Blair in the eastern BoB, with values decreasing from south to north, which is attributed to the similar gradient in the surface wind speed, which can be replicated in the sea salt abundance. The gradients are parameterized using best-fit analytical functions...|$|R
