This imaging application simulates a real-world hull inspection problem for Royal Canadian Navy Victoria-class submarines. The tile samples represent a challenging imaging application due to their large refractive index and absorption coefficient. With a rubber transmission window at approximately 80 [*]GHz, terahertz (THz) sensing methods have shown promise for probing these structures in the laboratory. Operating at Brewster’s angle allows for the typically strong front surface reflection to be minimized while also conveniently making the method insensitive to air-filled voids. Using a broadband THz time-domain waveform imaging system (THz-TDS), we demonstrate satisfactory imaging and detection of water-filled voids without complicated signal processing. Optical properties of the tile samples at low THz frequencies are also reported...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis were (i) {{to investigate the}} main sources and paths of noise on modern utility size wind turbines; (ii) to explore methods of reducing the noise; (iii) to assess our current ability to accurately predict and measure wind turbine noise. The accomplishment of these objectives would enable quieter wind turbines to be developed {{and allow them to}} be located near residential dwellings with greater confidence that the noise would not be a nuisance. A comprehensive review of the current literature was carried out and the findings were used as a basis for the investigative work conducted. It was found that wind turbine noise could be classed as either aerodynamically produced noise or mechanically produced noise. Aerodynamically produced noise on wind turbines arises mainly from the interaction of the flow over the blade with the surrounding air. Mechanically produced noise arises from a number of sources such as the gearbox, generator and hydraulic pumps. The noise can be radiated directly from the noisy component (airborne) and / or transferred through the structure of the turbine and radiated elsewhere (structure-borne) such as the tower. The prototype Windflow 500 wind turbine near to Christchurch was used {{for the majority of the}} investigative work carried out, and to assess the predictions made. The main radiators of noise from the turbine were identified as the blades (86 – 90 % of the total sound power), the tower (initially 8 – 12 % but later reduced to ~ 4 % of the total sound power), and the nacelle cladding (1 % of the total sound power). A prominent tone in the sound power spectrum from the turbine was observed in the 315 Hz 1 / 3 octave band. This was shown to be predominantly caused by gear meshing in the second stage of the gearbox at 311 Hz. The presence of the tone was significant because under commonly used standards a tonal penalty would be applied to the measured sound pressure level from the turbine to account for the extra annoyance caused by the tone. This in turn would mean that any potential wind farms would need to be sited further from residential dwellings than would otherwise be necessary in order to comply with noise regulations. Investigations were carried out that addressed the noise radiated from each of the main contributors outlined above. The sound power level radiated from the tower was found to be effectively reduced by attaching <b>rubber</b> <b>tiles</b> at strategic locations inside the tower. Noise radiated from the nacelle was reduced with a combination of acoustic insulation and acoustic absorption inside the nacelle. An investigation into the gearbox noise was also carried out. Attempts to reduce the tonal noise caused by gear meshing were made with little success but the investigation provided a good basis upon which to conduct further work. Preliminary investigations into both structure-borne and aerodynamically generated blade noise were carried out. The structure-borne blade noise investigation showed that the blades readily vibrated at a range of frequencies, the result being that structurally transmitted noise radiated from the blades was likely to be present at high levels. Research showed that the structure-borne noise radiated from the blades could be significantly reduced by partially filling the internal cavity of the blades with foam. The investigation of aerodynamically produced noise was carried out on a section of Windflow 500 blade in the low noise wind tunnel at the University of Canterbury. The tests showed that the blade generated noise at a range of frequencies including those in the 315 Hz 1 / 3 octave band. This suggested that the tonal noise measured from the blades was not only due to structurally transmitted noise from the gearbox but was also contributed to by aerodynamically produced noise. It was found that the noise from the blade section could be reduced by up to 4. 5 dB at certain frequencies by attaching serrated strips to the trailing edge of the aerofoil. Empirical equations for prediction of wind turbine sound power levels were evaluated and found to be in good agreement with measured data. It was found that accurate spectral predictions of the sound power level were much more difficult. However given spectral data for a turbine, it was found that accurate predictions of the noise propagation from the turbine could be made, taking into account meteorological effects and the effect of complex topography. It was found that the CONCAWE propagation model was well suited to the prediction of noise propagation from wind turbines because of its superior handling of meteorological effects. In an investigation carried out which modelled the Gebbies Pass site of the Windflow 500 it was found that the CONCAWE model could predict sound pressure levels from the turbine to within 2 dB at distances of up to 1400 m. Further work in the area of wind turbine noise should be focused on the reduction of blade noise. This is especially relevant to the Windflow 500 since blade noise was found to be by far the largest contributor to total noise radiated from the turbine. Acoustic treatments elsewhere would therefore produce only small reductions in the total sound power emitted by the turbine...|$|E
40|$|The {{flame-retardant}} chemicals, which commercially find {{applications in}} rubbers, {{are considered to}} be toxic chemicals, because of the liberation of their harmful volatile by products, when rubbers are on fire.

500|$|A boom in new {{construction}} after 1926 created stiff competition for older buildings like the Monadnock. Occupancy declined from 87percent in 1929 to 55percent in 1937 {{and the building}} began to lose money. In 1938, building manager Graham Aldis (Owen's nephew) announced what the Chicago Daily Tribune called [...] "the city's largest and most novel modernization job" [...] in a move toward halting the destruction of Chicago's aging skyscrapers. Rejecting the term [...] "modernization", Aldis called his plan [...] "progressive styling", which he believed would revolutionize the way building maintenance was done to preserve {{millions of dollars worth}} of buildings that would otherwise be destroyed. [...] "There is no reason why", he said, [...] "any well-designed office building need be torn down because of obsolescence."

40|$|Long-term {{standing}} {{is associated}} with multiple health problems affecting the lower extremity including musculoskeletal discomfort and fatigue. Unfortunately, many occupations require workers to endure prolonged periods of time spent standing. This research study investigated the effect of anti-fatigue flooring on subjective measures of discomfort and behavioral responses during long-term standing and walking. In addition to other measures of fatigue, near infrared spectroscopy {{was used to measure}} tissue oxygenation in the soleus and erector spinae muscles. Changes in muscle SO 2 can provide insight to the physiological processes that occur within muscles throughout long-term standing and walking. The goal was to determine the association between muscle SO 2 and subjective discomfort measures. Three flooring surfaces were examined in this study: a hard tile, a standard ergonomic soft mat, and a <b>rubber</b> <b>tile.</b> Subjects stood for 6 hours and walked for 2 hours on each of the 3 flooring surfaces. During this time, subjects rated levels of perceived discomfort while objective measures of fatigue were monitored. Flooring surface had a minimal impact on subjective discomfort during long-term standing. Additionally, erector spinae and soleus SO 2 were poorly related to subjective discomfort ratings. No significant changes in muscle SO 2 were found over time standing however, a positive relationship was revealed between soleus SO 2 and postural movements. Flooring effects were found after just 1 hour in subjective measures during long-term walking. Walking on the soft mat reduced overall leg tiredness, upper back discomfort, ankle discomfort, and feet discomfort compared to walking on the hard tile. Muscle SO 2 significantly increased from resting values but similar to the standing protocol, no flooring effects were found during long-term walking. The results from this research suggest the development of subjective discomfort during long-term standing is not easily related to changes in muscle SO 2 likely due to the increase in postural movements. The effect of flooring on muscle SO 2 is inconclusive due to the similarities in subjective discomfort found across flooring conditions examined in this study...|$|R

Bill Valentine, a designer at HOK, said [...] "Someone at Levi's said they wanted it to feel like a well-worn pair of blue jeans. And that's what we tried to do -- it's off the cuff, never symmetrical, it's easy-going and relaxed." [...] Levi Strauss wanted the new complex to promote mixing of all classes of employees. At its previous Embarcadero facility, the building forced upper level and lower level employees to be located on different floors, so the groups could not meet each other in common areas. A large atrium in one of the buildings is placed so that employees of all ranks receive the same view, and not just the higher up employees. Decks providing views of the surrounding city were used to integrate the inside and outside areas.Keiko Yamagami of Gensler and Associates said that the designs, which she said were buildings within larger buildings, gives the corridor the atmosphere of [...] "small street in a little town." [...] Each campus building houses a [...] "mini plaza." [...] Yamagami said that each one is [...] "sort of like the den in a home." [...] Contrasting materials, such as <b>rubber</b> <b>tile</b> flooring, set off major circulation areas within the campus. Yamagami says that the flooring, which has a pattern, uses colors that [...] "were almost like an impressionist painting." [...] She emphasized that it had [...] "West Coast sunset colors" [...] The campus also houses an exercise room and various kitchenettes with different themes. Yamagami said in 1989 that the [...] "garden den," [...] with furniture styled like those used in outdoor settings, was among the most popular. The Levi Strauss cafeteria has 30 ft by 40 ft pavilion spaces, each of which have distinct colors and identities. Yamagami said that the company [...] "didn't want to have an institutionalized cafeteria, they wanted to have a cafeteria that felt like a restaurant."Levi's Plaza incorporated the Italian Swiss Colony Building into its design, and the complex was designed to fit into the surrounding neighborhood. In 1991 David Armstrong of The Toronto Star said that at Levi's Plaza, the then-new red brick buildings [...] "blend in with historic warehouses." [...] The building was designed to respect the residents of Telegraph Hill, which provided a backdrop to Levi's Plaza.|$|R
