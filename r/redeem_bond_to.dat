40|$|Callable bond {{is a type}} of bond {{which allows}} an issuer <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> its <b>bonds</b> prior <b>to</b> {{maturity}} for specified price. Such a type of bond is very rare in Czech Republic. This scarcity is caused by undeveloped domestic bond market and also by domestic investors being conservative, preferring guaranteed income. Callable bond does not offer such certainty in cash flow. Therefore the aim of this diploma thesis is to provide a complex view on callable bonds, which is hitherto absent in Czech literature. This thesis starts with introduction of the general terms related <b>to</b> callable <b>bonds.</b> In the subsequent chapter, various uses of callable bonds follow. The third part analyses the biggest callable bond market in the world [...] the US callable bond market [...] and characterizes every particular sector of the market. The last part of the thesis deals with callable bonds' valuation and its advanced analytical measures that are constructed in connection with valuation models...|$|R

50|$|A {{callable}} bond (also called redeemable bond) {{is a type}} of bond (debt security) that allows the issuer of the <b>bond</b> <b>to</b> retain the privilege of <b>redeeming</b> the <b>bond</b> at some point before the bond reaches its date of maturity. In other words, on the call date(s), the issuer has the right, but not the obligation, to buy back the bonds from the bond holders at a defined call price. Technically speaking, the bonds are not really bought and held by the issuer but are instead cancelled immediately.|$|R

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{a bond with}} call {{features}} - i.e. where the issuer can <b>redeem</b> the <b>bond</b> early - is deemed to have negative convexity as rates approach the option strike, {{which is to say}} its duration will fall as rates fall, and hence its price will rise less quickly. This is because the issuer can <b>redeem</b> the old <b>bond</b> at a high coupon and re-issue a new bond at a lower rate, thus providing the issuer with valuable optionality.|$|R
50|$|In August 1818, {{with credit}} dangerously overextended, BUS branch offices began to reject all state-chartered bank notes under the {{direction}} of William Jones. Exceptions were made for notes used as revenue payments to the US Treasury. In October 1818, The US Treasury demanded a transfer of $2 million in specie from the BUS <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>bonds</b> on the Louisiana Purchase. State banks in the West and South, unable to provide the required specie, began to call in their loans on the heavily mortgaged lands they had financed. Cash poor farmers and speculators found their land values dropping 50% to 75%. Banks began foreclosing on the properties and transferring them to their creditor: the Second Bank of the United States.|$|R
50|$|Note that {{convexity}} can {{be positive}} or negative. A bond with positive convexity {{will not have}} any call features - i.e. the issuer must <b>redeem</b> the <b>bond</b> at maturity - which means that as rates fall, both its duration and price will rise.|$|R

50|$|A {{government}} bond is a bond issued {{by a national}} government. Such bonds are most often denominated in the country's domestic currency. Sovereigns can also issue debt in foreign currencies: almost 70% of all debt in 2000 was denominated in US dollars. Government bonds are sometimes regarded as risk-free bonds, because national governments can if necessary create money de novo <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> the <b>bond</b> in their own currency at maturity. Although many governments are prohibited by law from creating money directly (that function having been delegated to their central banks), central banks may provide finance by buying government <b>bonds,</b> sometimes referred <b>to</b> as monetizing the debt.|$|R

5000|$|A Government bond in a country's own {{currency}} is strictly speaking a risk-free bond, {{because the government}} can if necessary create additional currency in order <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> the <b>bond</b> at maturity.

40|$|Workers who delay {{retirement}} {{can save}} more and con-tribute {{more to the}} economy. Urban Institute simula-tions show that someone who works an extra five years could increase retirement spending by more than half. Also, work-inducing reforms—rather than reforms that simply reduce benefits—help close the Social Security funding gap. Delayed Retirement Could Ease Logjam An aging population and the approaching retirement of the largest birth cohort in U. S. history could mean a shortfall in promised Social Security benefits in 2017. After that, with baby boomers retiring in hoards, Social Security would be required <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>bonds</b> held by its Trust Funds. According to current projections, all Trust Fund assets will be depleted by 2041. This brief examines how changes in retirement behavior and reforms that encourage workers {{to stay on the}} job longer could ease the long-term funding logjam. The effectiveness of these changes is gauged using pro-jections of retirement age, Social Security take-up age, pensions, Social Security benefits, taxes, and other sig-nificant sources of income in retirement from the Urba...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} three aspects of {{convertible}} bonds financing using a Western European sample between 1994 and 2016. The first {{study of this}} thesis {{is related to the}} shareholder wealth effects at the announcement of the convertible bonds issuance during financial crises. We find that the market reaction is more negative during crises’ periods compared to that in normal periods. Analysis of the determinant of this reaction indicates that the market recognizes the potential of convertible <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> reduce agency and adverse selection costs. However, we also find that the signal of overvaluation sent by the issuance mitigates the investors’ optimism about the ability of the convertible <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> alleviate external financing costs and this bad signal is exacerbated during the financial crises. Furthermore, we find that firms that are short-sale constrained incur less negative market reaction. The second study tests the sequential financing theory of Mayers (1998) which supports that firms issue callable convertible <b>bonds</b> in order <b>to</b> implement optimal sequential financing strategy. We point out in this study the importance of the call provision by comparing the investment and financing activities of Western European firms that early called their convertible <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> those in the same industry that <b>redeemed</b> their <b>bonds</b> at maturity. We find that the inclusion of such provision allows firms (callable convertible <b>bonds</b> issuers) <b>to</b> better control issuance costs and signals a “strong” sequential financing strategy. We also find that the calling firms invest more than the non-calling firms at the call date and the difference-in-differences model shows that this difference is due to the call decision, after controlling for time fixed effects and other control variables. The last chapter of this thesis addresses the issue of convertible bonds call delay. As previous studies, we find that the companies do not call their bond at the optimum point identified by Ingersoll (1977). Unlike previous researches in the same area, our study considers the main theoretical rationales for convertible bonds call delay. We find strong evidence for the financial distress hypothesis, little evidence for cash flow advantage and signaling theories but no evidence for the notice period justification...|$|R

40|$|The {{structural}} {{diversity of}} arsenic sulfide molecules in compositions between As 4 S 6 and As 4 was investigated using ab initio quantum chemical calculations. The As 4 S 6 molecule {{consists of four}} trigonal pyramid coordinations of As atoms <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three S atoms. In the As 4 S 5 composition, only one type of molecular configuration corresponds to an uzonite-type molecule. In the As 4 S 4 composition, two molecular configurations exist with realgar-type and pararealgar-type molecules. Three molecular configurations are in the As 4 S 3 composition. The first configuration comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> two S atoms and one As atom, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one S atom and two As atoms. The second is the molecular configuration of dimorphite. The third comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three As atoms, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one As atom and two S atoms. The As 4 S 2 composition allows molecular configurations of two types. One is comprised of trigonal pyramidal As atom configurations of one type <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> two As atoms and one S atom. The other comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of three types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> two S atoms and one As atoms, <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one S atom and two As atoms, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three As atoms. The As 4 S molecule has trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one S atom and two As atoms, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three As atoms.
