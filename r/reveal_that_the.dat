5|$|Archaeological {{findings}} in the fields between West and East Worldham <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> area has been visited and inhabited {{since at least the}} Palaeolithic era. An Iron Age Hillfort, dated to around 100 BC, lay on the summit of King John's Hill, to the east of East Worldham. The Romans built a road from Chichester to Silchester which passed below the hill over what is now Green Street and Pookles Lane.|$|E

The U.S. State Department and British Government believed the tape to be propaganda produced by the KGB (as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and The Sunday Times). Although the tape was produced anonymously, The Observer linked the tape with the band. Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prime minister was personally aware of the tape and had discussed it with her cabinet.|$|E
5|$|If the Annals of Inisfallen {{is to be}} believed, Toirdelbach {{acquired}} {{possession of}} Dublin when the Dubliners themselves offered him its kingship. Although this record may be mere Uí Briain propaganda, it could instead <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Dubliners preferred a distant overlord from Munster rather than one from neighbouring Leinster. Within the year, the kingship was held by Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill (died 1075). The latter {{appears to have been}} a kinsman of Echmarcach, and may well have been handed the kinship by Toirdelbach, perhaps on account of the considerable distance between the kingdoms.|$|E

5|$|A {{designer}} named Tateaki Koshiki steps forward, {{claiming he}} developed the Solid State system before committing suicide. Kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into Koshiki's trap, allowing him to hack her cyberbrain. The Puppeteer reveals that he was spread across several egos until a collective consciousness emerged and developed into a Solid State, allowing him {{to move into the}} society beyond as the vanishing mediator. Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a cybernetic body and built the Solid State after he was hired by Munei. Kusanagi does not <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Puppeteer was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive. Batou concludes that the ultimate identity of the Puppeteer will remain unknown and that incident will be written off as a scandal.|$|E
5|$|An Iron Man 2 {{video game}} was {{released}} by Sega on May 4, 2010 in North America, written by The Invincible Iron Man scribe Matt Fraction. The Wii version was developed by High Voltage Software and all console versions were published by Sega, while Gameloft published the mobile game. The game's Comic-Con trailer showed that the Crimson Dynamo was set to appear as a villain. Cheadle and Jackson voice their respective characters in the games. The trailer revealed that A.I.M, Roxxon Energy Corporation, and Ultimo (depicted as a man named Kearson DeWitt in a large armor) are enemies in the game as well as <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wearer of the Crimson Dynamo armor is General Valentin Shatalov.

After giving their final goodbyes, Brody sees Kristin's limousine off while it drives off her street. As Kristin looks out of the window, a montage of archived footage from the series' earlier seasons is shown. In the final scene of the series, with the camera on Brody, the Hollywood Hills backdrop is pulled away, while the camera pans back to <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> entire scene was filmed on a backlot. In reality, the vehicle had not driven off and Kristin stepped out of the vehicle to hug Jenner.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E
5|$|However, Psittacosaurus may {{not have}} been entirely bipedal for its entire lifespan. Taking {{sections}} from the limb bones of 16 specimens of Psittacosaurus, ranging in age from less than a year old to ten-year old adults, Qi Zhao from the University of Bristol found that Psittacosaurus was probably secondarily bipedal. The infants' front limbs grew at faster rates than the hind limbs at between birth and three years of age. At the age of between four and six years, arm growth slowed and leg growth accelerated as the animal became mature. At this stage, Psittacosaurs would switch to a bipedal stance. These findings further <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ancestor of Psittacosaurus was likely quadrupedal and eventually gained the ability to become bipedal as it evolved, with the young retaining the quadrupedal gait of the ancestor in question. These findings also lead to the hypothesis that many such dinosaur families may have evolved along this path {{at some point in their}} evolution.|$|E

However, it also <b>reveals</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> M16's lighter, higher-velocity 5.56mm bullet {{has a tendency}} to fragment on impact causing larger wounds than the AK-47's heavier 7.62mm bullet, which does not fragment on impact.|$|R

5|$|Initially {{presented}} {{as the primary}} antagonist who he must capture, Nero’s encounters with Dante {{over the course of}} the game <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Order of the Sword is in fact responsible for a number of atrocities. Chief among them, is the Order's High-Ranking Scientist Agnus, who has succeeded in transforming himself, Credo, and a very-much-alive Sanctus into Demons with incredible power by siphoning demonic energy from Yamato, the long lost Devil Arm of Dante's twin brother Vergil. Furthermore, Sanctus has used Agnus' research to summon an army of demons to attack Fortuna, while simultaneously awakening a long dormant weapon called The Savior (a giant colossus made in Sparda's image) to destroy the threat; posing as the second coming of Sparda in order to eliminate non-believers, and strengthen his congregation’s worship.|$|E
5|$|Once {{candidates}} for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds {{according to the}} lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for {{four to six weeks}} or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{diagnosis}} and treatment are important {{in the care of}} TBI; if the injury is not diagnosed shortly after the injury, the risk of complications is higher. Bronchoscopy is the most effective method to diagnose, locate, and determine the severity of TBI, and it is usually the only method that allows a definitive diagnosis. Diagnosis with a flexible bronchoscope, which allows the injury to be visualized directly, is the fastest and most reliable technique. In people with TBI, bronchoscopy may <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> airway is torn, or that the airways are blocked by blood, or that a bronchus has collapsed, obscuring more distal (lower) bronchi from view.|$|E

5|$|Several {{elliptical}} {{rings of}} material {{have been observed}} in the outer regions of the debris disk between 500 and 800 AU: these may have formed {{as a result of}} the system being disrupted by a passing star. Astrometric data from the Hipparcos mission <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> red giant star Beta Columbae passed within 2 light years of Beta Pictoris about 110,000 years ago, but a larger perturbation would have been caused by Zeta Doradus, which passed at a distance of 3 light years about 350,000 years ago. However computer simulations favor a lower encounter velocity than either of these two candidates, which suggest that the star responsible for the rings may have been a companion star of Beta Pictoris on an unstable orbit. The simulations suggest a perturbing star with a mass of 0.5 solar masses is likely to blame for the structures. Such a star would be a red dwarf of spectral type M0V.|$|E

Visibly angered, V'Las lunges for the Kir'Shara, but is stunned by High-Minister Kuvak, who orders the fleet to stand down. Enterprise returns to Vulcan, and Koss visits to release T'Pol from their marriage. Meanwhile, the Vulcan High Command is dissolved, granting Earth greater autonomy, and the katra of Surak is transferred to a Vulcan high priest. V'Las, relieved of his post, meets secretly with Talok, revealed as a Romulan agent, who states that the reunification of their worlds {{is only a matter}} of time.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Elton (7th Bt) began {{updating}} {{the house before}} 1850 (and the lodge at the gate dates from 1851) {{but it was in}} 1860s that he made major changes. The west wing was extended and remodelled, this time with an Elizabethan style façade. Less obvious alterations to the east end (where the servants lived and worked) probably also date to this period. The fire of 1882 destroyed much of the western end of the house. In the rebuilding that followed, an even larger west end was constructed but Sir Arthur took pains to ensure that its Elizabethan south front was conserved and retained. Postcards of Clevedon <b>reveal</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> last change to the great hall window was made in about 1912, when it was given a square head again, in Elizabethan style.|$|E
