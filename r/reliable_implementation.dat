40|$|This paper surveys how formal {{verification}} {{can be used}} to prove the correctness of ad hoc routing protocols, which are fundamental infrastructure of wireless sensor networks. The existing techniques fall into two classes: verification on small-scale networks and verification on unbounded networks. The former one is always fully automatic and easy to use, thanks to the limited state space generated in verification. However, it cannot prove the correctness over all cases. The latter one can provide a complete proof based on abstractions of unbounded network. However, it usually needs user intervention and expertise in verification. The two kinds of technique are illustrated by verifications against some key properties such as stability, loop-freedom and deadlock-freedom. To conclude, they {{can be used to}} find faults and prove correctness, respectively.
