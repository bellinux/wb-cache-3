40|$|Abstract Traditional {{industrial}} luminaires possess {{little if}} any uplight component. As a result, ceiling surface luminances {{and in some cases}} wall luminances in industrial settings tend to be low, giving the overall environment a cave-like appearance. Although this type of lighting can provide the required quantity of light on the work surface, it does little to address other design issues including the psycho-logical needs of the industrial worker. Can <b>room</b> <b>surface</b> brightnesses in an industrial environment affect an industrial worker’s visual perception and sense of satisfaction with that environment? This study compared four commercially available industrial lighting systems, each with a different percent-age of uplight. Actual industrial workers from various companies evaluated the systems in an industrial-like setting. Both a semantic differential scaling technique and a lighting-specific evaluation technique were used in the study. The results indicate a preference on the part of industrial workers for an environment with higher average <b>room</b> <b>surface</b> luminances. Impressions of spaciousness, brightness and stimulation correlated with an overall preference for higher surface luminances. The implication is that the psychological impact of lighting in the industrial environment should be an important consid-eration during the design process for industrial spaces. ...|$|E

40|$|Sound {{reproduction}} systems using omnidirectional loudspeakers produce reflections from <b>room</b> <b>surfaces</b> which {{interfere with}} the desired sound field within the array. While active compensation systems can reduce the reverberant level, they require calibration in each room and are processor-intensive.

40|$|<b>Room</b> <b>surface</b> {{estimation}} is {{the process}} of estimating and characterizing the surfaces of a room from the measurement provided by an array of microphones. In any normal room, wavefront radiated by the source reaches the microphones after reflecting from the surfaces of the room. On performing the post processing on this recorded signal, {{depending on the type of}} source signal used; we obtain the unique signature of the room called the room impulse response (RIR). Historically room impulse responses have been used to calculate the acoustical parameters. These are generally used for objective evaluation of the rooms. Here is an effort to extract more information out of the RIR by understanding the physics of it. In this thesis the reflection from the surfaces is employed as useful information and methods to use this information are presented. The reflective information can be used in the determination of the reflection coefficient of the surface. The reflection coefficients of four common room materials are obtained from their respective impulse response at oblique incidence. The obtained reflection coefficients are studied for the classification of materials. The problem of estimating the <b>room</b> <b>surface</b> using the reflection coefficients has been approached in a systematic way, accounting for parasitic reflections and background noise. The room impulse response is obtained using the sine sweep signal transmitted through the speaker attached to one microphone array, and recorded by another microphone array. The recorded signal was used to identify possible surfaces using clustering on the obtained reflection coefficients. The classification so obtained is compared with the ground truth to calculate the performance and practicability. /Kir 1...|$|E

They could help in reducing patient stress, fatigue and length of stay, while increasing patient and staff safety and satisfaction. However, in desert locations that are typically characterized by year-long clear skies, control of solar penetration is essential. Window blinds were used to decrease patients’ visual discomfort and improve illuminance levels. The shape of blind slats influences daylighting performance and exposure to external view. The objective {{of this paper was}} to identify the shapes of horizontal blind slats that best suit a common hospital patient room layout design under the predominantly clear-sky of Cairo, Egypt. The paper utilized parametric tools and simulation software to systematically test possible slat shapes. A total of 77 slat shapes were examined. The objective was to fulfill year-round daylighting adequacy on the bed surface and the room area, and to maximize patient’s access to external view. The shading system examined in this paper was an internal horizontal blind that looks similar to Venetian blinds, but fixed with no movement. The shape of all slats of the tested blinds was simultaneously adjusted for examination. The effect of changing slat shapes was examined by evaluating daylighting performance in terms of Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA) and Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE) on both the bed surface and the <b>room</b> <b>surface</b> planes. Exposure to external view, expressed as External View Factor (EVF) was also addressed. The two tips of each slat were kept fixed in position. The position of an intermediate point on the slat surface was systematically adjusted in the horizontal and vertical directions creating curved blind slat shapes. Results revealed that the sDA on the <b>room</b> <b>surface</b> plane was the limiting factor in determining acceptable slat shapes. The range of acceptable slat shapes according to the sDA on the bed surface criterion was larger than that of the whole room area. In addition, all tested slat shapes provided acceptable ASE performance. Blinds with flat or gently curved slat shapes scored better results in both daylighting and external view exposure. Position of the intermediate point of the slat – in most of the accepted cases – fell in a narrow vertical range around the horizontal base line. Changing the position of the intermediate point horizontally in either direction resulted in a marginal effect on the performance of the accepted cases. It was observed that the closer the intermediate point {{to the center of the}} slat, the better was the performance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid ray-tracing and radiosity method for processing luminous flux in spaces equipped with venetian blinds. The method considers both diffuse and specular characteristics of blinds and aims {{to establish a}} balance between computational speed and accuracy. Specular components are treated using ray-tracing techniques using a shining factor for the blinds to split between directly and diffusely reflected components. The direct components are traced inside the blind cavity and inside the room while the direct-diffuse components inside the blind cavity are processed in a two-dimensional radiosity calculation until the final diffuse flux departing the cavity is determined. Diffuse-to-diffuse transmission is considered using a traditional radiosity method. Each <b>room</b> <b>surface</b> is divided into sub-surfaces and given an initial luminous exitance, after accounting for directly traced portions. Then a 3 -D radiosity method is employed for the entire room to compute illuminance distributions on each subsurface and on the work plane. The developed model will help in the estimation of daylight distributions in spaces with venetian blinds and potential lighting energy savings calculations if combined with electric lighting controls. It will also lead to development of new control algorithms for shading and lighting systems for perimeter spaces with controllable shading devices...|$|E
40|$|The {{waning effect}} of neuromuscular {{blocking}} agents {{towards the end}} of surgery often necessi-tates the addition of a further increment of blocker. When a longer acting agent (e. g. tubo-curarine or pancuronium) is used, this additional increment may delay recovery [1]. Atracurium and vecuronium, the two intermediate acting agents, may be used for longer surgical pro-cedures, although repeated bolus administration or continous infusion is required [2, 3]. It would seem logical to use a longer acting agent to produce initial neuromuscular block and to use atracurium or vecuronium if extension of the block is needed. This technique is satisfactory with pancuronium and vecuronium [4], but no data are available for the other agents. We have therefore examined the effect of atracurium and vecuronium when given to supplement an existing neuromuscular block produced by tubocurarine.
