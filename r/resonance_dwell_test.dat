The variation of the modal parameters with different levels of impact energy and density of damage is studied. Vibration tests have been carried out with both burst random and sine <b>dwell</b> <b>testing</b> in order to evaluate the damping estimation efficiency of these methods in the presence of damage. Sine <b>dwell</b> <b>testing</b> is done in both up and down frequency directions in order to detect structural non-linearities. Results show that damping ratio is a more sensitive parameter for damage detection than the natural frequency. Design of experiments (DOE) highlighted density of damage as the factor having a more significant effect on the modal parameters and also proved that sine <b>dwell</b> <b>testing</b> is more suitable for damping estimation in the presence of damage as compared to burst random testing...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the processes which govern dwell notch low cycle fatigue (NLCF) behavior of a powder metallurgy (P/M) ME 3 disk superalloy. The emphasis was placed on the environmentally driven mechanisms which may embrittle the highly stressed notch surface regions and reduce NLCF life. In conjunction with the environmentally driven notch surface degradation processes, the visco-plastic driven mechanisms which can significantly change the notch root stresses were also considered. Dwell notch low cycle fatigue testing was performed in air and vacuum on a ME 3 P/M disk alloy specimens heat treated using either a fast or a slow cooling rate from the solutioning treatment. It was shown that dwells at the minimum stress typically produced a greater life debit than the dwells applied at the maximum stress, especially for the slow cooled heat treatment. Two different environmentally driven failure mechanisms were identified as the root cause of early crack initiation in the min <b>dwell</b> <b>tests.</b> Both of these failure mechanisms produced mostly a transgranular crack initiation failure mode and yet still resulted in low NLCF fatigue lives. The lack of stress relaxation during the min <b>dwell</b> <b>tests</b> produced higher notch root stresses which caused early crack initiation and premature failure when combined with the environmentally driven surface degradation mechanisms. The importance of environmental degradation mechanisms was further highlighted by vacuum <b>dwell</b> NLCF <b>tests</b> which resulted in considerably longer NLCF lives, especially for the min <b>dwell</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

Static (tensile and creep rupture) and cyclic properties of both alloys were characterized. The cntrolled strain LCF {{tests were conducted}} at 760 C (1400 F) and 649 C (1200 F) for AF 2 - 1 DA and INCO 718, respectively. Hold times were varied for tensile, compressive and tensile/compressive strain <b>dwell</b> (relaxation) <b>tests.</b> Stress (creep) hold behavior of AF 2 - 1 DA was also evaluated. Generally, INCO 718 exhibited more pronounced reduction in cyclic life due to hold than AF 2 - 1 DA. The percent reduction in life for both alloys for strain <b>dwell</b> <b>tests</b> was greater at low strain ranges (longer life regime). Changing hold time from 0 to 0. 5, 2. 0 and 15. 0 min. resulted in corresponding reductions in life.

Powder metallurgy processed, supersolvus heat treated Udimet (trademark) 720 and ME 3 fatigue specimens were exposed in air at temperatures of 650 to 704 C, for times of 100 h to over 1000 h. They were then tested using conventional fatigue tests at 650 and 704 C, {{to determine the}} effects of exposure on fatigue resistance. Cyclic <b>dwell</b> verification <b>tests</b> were also performed to contrast the effects of intermixed exposures and fatigue cycles. The prior exposures reduced life by up to 70 % and increased the scatter in life, compared to unexposed levels. Cyclic <b>dwell</b> <b>tests</b> reduced lives even more. Fractographic evaluations indicated the failure mode was shifted by the exposures and cyclic dwells from predominantly internal to often surface crack initiations. The increased scatter in life was related to the competition between internal crack initiations at inclusions or large grains producing longer lives, and surface crack initiations at an environmentally affected surface layer producing shorter lives...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{the multivariate}} mode {{indicator}} function (MMIF) method {{has been applied}} to simulated flutter test data in order to evaluate the potential application of normal mode force appropriation to flight flutter testing where there are many close modes and noise levels are severe. It is seen that the approach is capable of estimating accurate modal frequencies and force patterns from corrupted test data, for use in the appropriation of particular modes. Damping ratios are accurately estimated from a decay response following a <b>resonance</b> <b>dwell.</b> The complex mode indicator function (CMIF) has also been considered. The practical limitations of in-flight force appropriation are discussed, and the effects of the limited excitation possibilities are demonstrated by simulation. The number and position of exciters used are arguably the most important factors in determining the success of this technique. The application of force appropriation to flight flutter testing may well depend on the availability of small detachable vanes which allow direct excitation of all areas of the aircraft structure...|$|R
40|$|Disclosed are a {{nondestructive}} {{method and}} apparatus {{for determining the}} structural integrity of materials by combining laser vibrometry with damping analysis to determine the damping loss factor. The method comprises the steps of vibrating the area being tested over a known frequency range and measuring vibrational force and velocity vs time over the known frequency range. Vibrational velocity is preferably measured by a laser vibrometer. Measurement of the vibrational force depends on the vibration method: if an electromagnetic coil is used to vibrate a magnet secured to the area being tested, then the vibrational force {{is determined by the}} coil current. If a reciprocating transducer is used, the vibrational force is determined by a force gauge in the transducer. Using vibrational analysis, a plot of the drive point mobility of the material over the preselected frequency range is generated from the vibrational force and velocity data.

40|$|The Liquid Motion Experiment (LME), which flew on STS 84 in May 1997, was an {{investigation}} of liquid motions in spinning, nutating tanks. LME was designed to quantify the effects of such liquid motions on the stability of spinning spacecraft, which {{are known to be}} adversely affected by the energy dissipated by the liquid motions. The LME hardware was essentially a spin table which could be forced to nutate at specified frequencies at a constant cone angle, independently of the spin rate. Cylindrical and spherical test tanks, partially filled with liquids of different viscosities, were located at the periphery of the spin table to simulate a spacecraft with off-axis propellant tanks; one set of tanks contained generic propellant management devices (PMDs). The primary quantitative data from the flight tests were the liquid-induced torques exerted on the tanks about radial and tangential axes {{through the center of the}} tank. Visual recordings of the liquid oscillations also provided qualitative information. The flight program incorporated two types of tests: sine sweep tests, in which the spin rate was held constant and the nutation frequency varied over a wide range; and sine <b>dwell</b> <b>test,</b> in which both the spin rate and the nutation frequency were held constant. The sine sweep tests were meant to investigate all the prominent liquid resonant oscillations and the damping of the resonances, and the sine <b>dwell</b> <b>tests</b> were meant to quantify the viscous energy dissipation rate of the liquid oscillations for steady state conditions. The LME flight data were compared to analytical results obtained from two companion IR&D programs at Southwest Research Institute. The comparisons indicated that the models predicted the observed liquid resonances, damping, and energy dissipation rates for many test conditions but not for all. It was concluded that improved models and CFD simulations are needed to resolve the differences. This work is ongoing under a current IR&D program...|$|R

Servo press {{facilities}} {{are becoming increasingly}} used in industry and many attempts are being made to bring out their characteristic features for enhancing the formability of high-strength steel sheets. One {{of the most remarkable}} features of the servo press lies in its flexibility in slide motion control. It is thus effective to investigate the relevance of the strain rate sensitivity of a material to the mechanism of improvement in formability enabled by the flexible slide motion of the servo press. In this study, the Norton creep law was introduced in the FEM solver to take into account visco-elasto-plastic deformation including stress relaxation behavior. Parameters for the visco-elasto-plastic material model were identified through physical measurements and FEM simulations of uniaxial tension and crosshead displacement <b>dwell</b> <b>tests.</b> The identified material model was applied to sheet forming simulations of an automotive body part, and the validity of the model was examined by comparison with stamping experiments using a servo press with different slide motions.

40|$|The {{influences}} of heat treatment and cyclic dwells on the notch fatigue resistance of powder metallurgy disk superalloys were investigated for low solvus high refractory (LSHR) and ME 3 disk alloys. Disks were processed to produce material conditions with varied microstructures and associated mechanical properties. Notched specimens were first subjected to baseline dwell fatigue cycles having a dwell at maximum load, {{as well as}} tensile, stress relaxation, creep rupture, and dwell fatigue crack growth tests at 704 C. Several material heat treatments displayed a bimodal distribution of fatigue life with the lives varying by two orders-of-magnitude, while others had more consistent fatigue lives. This response was compared to other mechanical properties, in search of correlations. The wide scatter in baseline dwell fatigue life was observed only for material conditions resistant to stress relaxation. For selected materials and conditions, additional tests were then performed with the dwells shifted in part or in total to minimum tensile load. The <b>tests</b> performed with <b>dwells</b> at minimum load exhibited lower fatigue lives than max <b>dwell</b> <b>tests,</b> and also exhibited early crack initiation and {{a substantial increase in}} the number of initiation sites.

40|$|Dwell {{sensitivity}} in {{titanium alloys}} is generally {{attributed to the}} phenomenon of load shedding, which is a time dependent redistribution of stress from weak grains, with their c-axis perpendicular to the loading direction, to strong grains, with their c-axis approximately parallel to the loading direction. This leads {{to the formation of}} internal quasi-cleavage facets on the basal planes of strong grains. In this paper, the effect of load holds on the fatigue behaviour of drawn Ti- 6 Al- 4 V wires is investigated, because these wires do not contain strong α grains. It has been found that this leads to a different dwell fatigue behaviour compared to what has been described in literature. In the case of drawn wires, introducing load holds promoted crack initiation at the surface, through the formation of a facet on a prismatic plane of a surface grain that was oriented for very easy prismatic slip. This was confirmed by sectioning facets, using focused ion beam milling, and electron backscatter diffraction measurements. Because of the specific crystallographic texture of drawn wires, the phenomenon of load shedding is less pronounced, and there is no formation of internal facets. The amount of cycles to failure was reduced by two to three orders of magnitude compared to fatigue tests without load holds. The time to failure remained similar, and was even higher for some <b>dwell</b> fatigue <b>tests.</b> There was a significant amount of strain accumulation during <b>dwell</b> fatigue <b>tests.</b> The maximum strain increased more rapidly in tests with 30 s load holds compared to tests with 120 s load holds, due to creep recovery during the periods in between load holds.

40|$|The Liquid Motion Experiment (LME), {{designed}} {{to study the}} effects of liquid motion in rotating tanks, was flown on STS 84. LME was essentially a spin table that created a realistic nutation motion of scale-model tanks containing liquid. TWo spherical and two cylindrical transparent tanks were tested simultaneously, and three sets of such tanks were employed to vary liquid viscosity, fill level, and propellant management device (PMD) design. All the tanks were approximately 4. 5 inches diameter. The primary test measurements were the radial and tangential torques exerted on the tanks by the liquid. Resonant frequencies and damping of the liquid oscillations were determined by sine sweep tests. For a given tank shape, the resonant frequency depended on fill level. For the cylindrical tanks, the resonances had somewhat different frequencies for the tangential axis (0. 55 to 0. 75 times spin rate) and the radial axis (0. 73 to 0. 78 times spin rate), and the tangential axis resonance agreed more closely with available analytical models. For the spherical tanks, the resonant frequencies were between 0. 74 to 0. 77 times the spin rate and were the same for the tangential and radial axes. The damping coefficients varied from about I% to 3 % of critical, depending on tank shape, fill level, and liquid viscosity. 'Me viscous energy dissipation rates of the liquid oscillations were determined from sine <b>dwell</b> <b>tests.</b> The LME energy dissipation rates varied from 0. 3 to 0. 5 times the estimates obtained from scaling previous ground tests and spacecraft flight data.

30|$|Numerical {{calculation}} {{is carried}} out to study optical properties and sensing performance of MIM structure sensor with patterned triangle unit. The enhanced local electric field and high absorption simultaneously is attributed to the strong lighting rod effect of Au triangle disks, plasmonic resonance coupling of electric resonance among Au triangle disks and magnetic <b>resonance</b> which <b>dwelled</b> in the SiO 2 layer, and high-density arranged triangle MIM arrays. The interaction among adjacent triangle disks of our structure and parameter effect on absorption peak is negligible. The thicknesses of the SiO 2 layer and top Au layer influence the position and amplitude of peaks, which are caused by adjusting electric dipoles and magnetic dipoles of MIM structure to match impedance, and the increasing of geometric dimensions of triangles when the thickness of SiO 2 /Au triangle layer increases. When the suggested structure matches its effective impedance well, the absorption is extremely high (>[*] 90 %). Due to the long tips of triangle Au arrays, the FWHM of peaks is very narrow, about 5  nm.

The principal technical issues are outlined which are related to system reliability, including key technology issues such as failure mode synergism, sequential failure mechanisms, and fault tree definition...|$|R
40|$|Strain controlled, {{continuous}} cycling and 2 minute compressive <b>dwell</b> LCF <b>tests</b> {{were performed}} on simulated LPMTM wide-gap repair joints in the nickel-base superalloy Inconel 738 at 850 °C over a total strain range (A+) of 0. 4 to 0. 9 percent, 0. 33 Hz, A = 03, R =- 1. The test specimens were uncoated hybrid bars fabricated with a gauge section consisting of a cast inner core and an equal cross-sectional area overlayer of Inconel 738 LPMTM repair material. For samples with near-surface porosity of 0. 25 mm and under, the fatigue lives of the LPMTM samples were about equal to those of cast Inconel 738 when AET < 0. 5 %, and approximately one-half to three-fourths for strains above this level. A two minute compressive hold reduced the fatigue lives of both the hybrid samples and cast Inconel 738 {{by a factor of}} 5 to 10 as compared to the continuous cycling tests, due to the increased creep, oxidation and mean-stress effects. In all cases, the dominant fatigue cracks initiated at near-surface pores. At strains below AE ~ = 0. 5 % crack propagation was transgranular, but shifted to an intergranular mode at higher strains. For specimens with near-surface porosity of approximately 0. 5 mm, the fatigue lives were much shorter and initiation of the dominant cracks took place at these features. The results of these and other mechanical property tests indicate that, using the appropriate non-destructive inspection procedures and defect size restrictions, the LPMTM repair limits can potentially be extended into the more fatigue-sensitive areas of components such as airfoil leading edges...|$|R
40|$|Four {{microstructural}} {{variants of}} ATI 718 Plus Alloy (718 Plus) are produced via modified heat treatments to elucidate {{the effects of}} grain size, precipitate size, morphology, and phase fraction (3 ̆b 4 and 3 ̆b 32 ̆ 032), on the mechanical properties of low cycle fatigue (LCF) life, fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) properties, and Dwell FCGR behaviour at both 649 (1200) and 704 (1300) under 100 s dwell and non <b>dwell</b> conditions. Similar <b>tests</b> are also performed on Waspaloy in two comparative microstructural conditions. FCGR results show that at both test temperatures, all microstructural conditions of 718 Plus and Waspaloy exhibit identical behavior in the steady state regime, except that 718 Plus exhibits a much higher threshold stress intensity (2 ̆ 206 KTH). However, the Dwell FCGR results show that Waspaloy displays better steady state crack growth resistance under dwell conditions; with an optimized precipitate microstructure of 718 Plus showing considerable improvement. LCF test results demonstrate that all four microstructural conditions of 718 Plus have superior life compared to Waspaloy under all test conditions. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|The {{entire nation}} paid {{a high price}} militarily, politically, {{economically}} and socially during the twenty-six-year-old conflict in Sri Lanka. However, May 18, 2009, marked a significant milestone in the written history of Sri Lanka. The three-year-long Humanitarian Operation conducted by the Sri Lankan Security Forces to liberate civilians from the cruel clutches of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) terrorists ended, assigning a total military defeat to the LTTE. As a nation, Sri Lanka is now facing {{the daunting task of}} a range of challenges in the post-war era. Above all, much effort is needed to heel the scars of the conflict and to build the Sri Lankan identity. Though the war is over, the remnants of the LTTE may pose a considerable security challenge. Amongst them are many surrendered combatants of the LTTE who are being rehabilitated and absorbed into the society. Sacred responsibility lies with the government in rehabilitating ex-combatants is to ensure a long-term, results-oriented process. Considering the highly sensitive status quo of the issue at the aftermath of its conflict, the Sri Lankan government needs to contribute its share to rebuild the nation. Therefore, this thesis <b>dwells</b> on <b>testing</b> the benchmarks expected by the Sri Lankan government in carrying out this process and the outcome so far, in meeting the said contesting national requirement in comparison to other cases in the world. In this sense, the question arises as to how the programs of reintegration can be successful, and what potential problems could arise in the process of reintegration. Therefore, this thesis attempts to identify the questions of the Sri Lankan case in comparison to other cases, in understanding how de-radicalization and re-integration evolved in these countries, and how they reached the benchmarks by overcoming weaknesses and lapses.

40|$|Objective: In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the biocompatibility profile of a newly designed peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF), we evaluated peritoneal leukocyte (PMΦ) cytokine release following overnight in vivo dwells using standard, lactatebuffered, single-chamber bag PDF (Lac-PDF) and purely bicarbonate-buffered, double-chamber bag PDF containing 34 (Bic-PDF) or 39 (Bic Hi-PDF) mmol/L bicarbonate. ♦ Design: A randomized, open, crossover clinical trial with single weekly <b>test</b> <b>dwells</b> was performed in stable, long-term continuous ambulatory PD patients (n = 8). During 8 -hour overnight dwells, PMΦ were exposed to different PDF containing 1. 5 % glucose. After drainage, peritoneal cells were isolated and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium for 2 or 3 hours, with and without stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Ex vivo release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and interleukin (IL) - 6 was measured by specific ELISA technique. ♦ Results: After pre-exposure to Lac-PDF, PMΦ generated 242 ± 279 pg TNFα/ 10 6 cells and 157 ± 105 pg IL- 6 / 10 6 cells. When pre-exposed to Bic-PDF and Bic Hi-PDF, TNFα and IL- 6 production of PMΦ was {{not significantly different from}} Lac-PDF. After LPS stimulation (100 ng/mL), PMΦ secretion of TNFα and IL- 6 pre-exposed to three PDF revealed no significant differences between groups: TNF...|$|R
