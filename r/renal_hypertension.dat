The target of our work was to study {{the structural}} and functional features of the left ventricle of the heart in patients with <b>renal</b> <b>hypertension</b> without signs of kidney failure.   Echodopplercardiography of structural and functional parameters of left ventricular heart disease was applied in 136 patients with hypertensive form of chronic glomerulonephritis. The study showed that patients with <b>renal</b> <b>hypertension</b> without signs of kidney failure, ranging from grade 2 hypertensive syndrome, LV hypertrophy develops.

40|$|OBJECTIVEThis study {{investigated}} the effectiveness of unilateral nephrectomy {{in the treatment of}} <b>renal</b> <b>hypertension</b> in adults with an atrophic kidney, and set out to establish whether this is an appropriate mode of treatment for <b>renal</b> <b>hypertension</b> not otherwise controlled by antihypertensive drugs or other surgical procedures. METHODSWe conducted a retrospective review of 600 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic renal surgery from 1998 to 2006 by a single surgeon. Seventeen underwent unilateral nephrectomy for the management of uncontrolled <b>renal</b> <b>hypertension</b> to remove a non-functioning, scarred, and contracted kidney. All patients had normal contralateral kidneys and normal renal functions preoperatively. Results were analysed by Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Statistically significant results (p < 0. 0001) with a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 27 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 17. 5 mmHg, more than 6 months after unilateral nephrectomy for treatment of <b>renal</b> <b>hypertension</b> were consistently maintained. RESULTSOf the potential modifying factors related to reduction in blood pressure, only age was found to modify the reduction in systolic blood pressure, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of − 0. 538 (p = 0. 026). At 6 months, the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was 27 mmHg and that for diastolic blood pressure was 17. 5 mmHg (p < 0. 0001, Wilcoxon's signed rank test).

40|$|PERCUTANEOUS transluminal {{dilatation}} of the renal artery using a balloon-tipped catheter may be {{the most}} important advance in the management of <b>renal</b> vascular <b>hypertension</b> since the advent of renin measurement. A report in this issue, by the developers of percutaneous transluminal dilatation (1) documents in seven of eight patients the technical feasibility of treating <b>renal</b> vascular <b>hypertension</b> using this technique. Although the number of patients is small and the duration of follow-up short, the study is nonetheless important and its results encour-aging. The authors are careful, however, to acknowledge that long-term follow-up data from a randomized com-parison with reconstructive vascular surgery are needed to define the proper role of their new method in the ther-apy of <b>renal</b> vascular <b>hypertension.</b> The latter proviso seems both timely and circumspect. The use of transluminal dilatation is spreading like wild-fire among physicians. For example, one manufacturer sold 2300 balloon-tipped dilatation catheters during the first 3 months of 1979, although certainly these catheters may have been used to dilate arteries other than the renal artery. We are personally aware of 200 cases in which percutaneous transluminal dilatation has been employed for treatment of renal vascular disease. Such a rapid and extensive proliferation of this new method is both excit-ing and frightening. It is exciting because it offers poten-tial as a relatively simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, and readily available alternative to renal artery reconstructive surgery. It is unnerving to those experienced in managing <b>renal</b> vascular <b>hypertension</b> for several reasons: Criteri...|$|R

The blood pressure was markedly high when he visited our hospital and peripheral plasma renin activity was also elevated. Urinalysis was normal except for slight proteinuria. The excretory urogram demonstrated cortical scarring in the lower portion of the left kidney. The renal scintigram demonstrated low uptake in this area, suggesting renal infarction. Renal arteriogram showed decreased vascularity in this area. Plasma renin activity was measured on the blood drawn from the renal vein of both sides and the ratio was about 2. 4, and renin activity of the segmental renal vein from the left lower portion was elevated.

Importance of factors other than renin content of renal venous plasma has not been investigated.

40|$|There is {{a direct}} {{proportionality}} between the degree of adrenal and that of cardiac enlargement in experimental <b>renal</b> <b>hypertension.</b> This is evidence for {{the participation of the}} adrenal to an extent dependent on the severity of the hypertension as reflected in the degree of cardiac hypertrophy. The greater part of the weight increase of the adrenal is due to growth of the cortex. However, the relative degree of medullary growth exceeds that of cortical growth. There is evidence of medullary hyperplasia, but the cortical growth may be due to cell hypertrophy alone. In view of the known relationship between prolonged skeletal muscle work {{and the size of the}} adrenals, in which there is likewise a relatively greater growth of the medulla, the possibility that adrenal growth in experimental <b>renal</b> <b>hypertension</b> is a consequence of the metabolic demand of increased heart muscle work must be considered. The hyperplastic, hypertrophic medulla of the renal hypertensive rat is presumed to be producing increased amounts of a hormone whose action is not known. The adrenal medulla is not necessary for the development of moderate <b>renal</b> <b>hypertension</b> though this does not exclude the possibility that it may be involved somehow in the maintainance of the hypertensive state. Large, periodic-Schiff-positive, hyaline droplets are found in the cytoplasm of adrenal cortical cells with nuclear evidence of active function. There is some evidence that these indicate hypophyseal stimulation. Similar particles are found in the medulla, suggesting an interrelationship between the two parts of the adrenal. The close resemblance of changes in adrenal weight, nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and nuclear and cytoplasmic structure, indicates that similar physiological and morphological controlling mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis and maintainance of experimental <b>renal</b> <b>hypertension</b> and clinical essential hypertension...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Male Sprague-Dawley rats with {{unilateral}} renal artery stenosis and a contralateral untouched kidney {{develop a}} malignant hypertension (MH) which {{is characterized by}} high blood pressures, sodium and water depletion, and subsequent activation of the renin-angiotensin system. In the present studies we found plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations 3 -fold higher than those in rats with benign <b>renal</b> <b>hypertension,</b> and 4 - to 5 -fold higher than those in normotensive control rats. Analysis of individual values showed considerable scatter; about 50 % of the values fell {{in the range of}} benign hypertensive or control rats. When a specific AVP antiserum was injected, iv, into eight conscious unrestrained MH rats, BP transiently fell toward control values in four; in one, BP fell by only 10 mm Hg, and three other MH rats showed no response. In the same rats, injection of a specific angiotensin II antiserum always induced a transient fall in BP. On the basis of these and previously reported observations, we conclude that, subsequent to sodium and water loss and activation of the renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin release is stimulated in a significant number of MH rats and that, in these rats, vasopressin may cause significant systemic vasoconstriction. Thereby vasopressin may {{contribute to the development of}} malignant <b>renal</b> <b>hypertension</b> in rats.
