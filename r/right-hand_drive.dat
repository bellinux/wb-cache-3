5|$|In May 2011, all 24,091 C3 Picassos in the UK were {{recalled}} for {{a safety}} modification, following complaints and {{an investigation by}} BBC consumer affairs programme Watchdog into brakes that could be activated {{on the passenger side}} of the <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Production reached 7128 cars {{over three}} {{distinct}} series. The factory only ever designated two, the Mark I and Mark II, {{but as the}} official Mark I production spanned the change in body style from the Series IV Alpine panels to the Series V panels, the later Mark I cars are generally designated Mark IA by Sunbeam Tiger enthusiasts. The Mark II Tiger, fitted with the larger Ford , was intended exclusively for export to America and was never marketed in the UK, although six <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> models were sold to the Metropolitan Police for use in traffic patrols and high-speed pursuits; four more went to the owners of important Rootes dealerships.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Usher {{sitting on a}} sofa with a {{backdrop}} of his girlfriend. When the verse starts, Usher goes to a wide glass window pane, looking at his girlfriend swimming in the pool. The surface is aflame after she is immersed in the water. In the next scene, Usher and his mistress are having sex. While {{sitting on the edge}} of the bed, Usher reminisces about the moments he and his girlfriend had have in the same bed. The bedsheets burn, the scene then cutting to Usher riding a silver <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> Aston Martin DB5 with a British registration - EGF 158B (the car was featured in the TV series Fastlane). The video cuts with the backdrop also burning. Continuing to the car scene, Usher stops as he sees his imaginary girl again. He and dances, executing various hand routines. Video intercuts follow and the video ends with Usher standing. Right before the last chorus, the screen changes from a small screen to a full one with no framework.|$|E
50|$|Released between 1994-1998, the South Africa {{version of}} the 316i {{featured}} an 1796cc engine, although it had a 316i badge.Apart from being a <b>right-hand</b> <b>driven</b> vehicle, all {{other aspects of the}} vehicle was identical to its international 316i equivalent/counterpart.|$|R
50|$|Most Amphicars {{were sold}} in the United States. Cars {{were sold in}} the United Kingdom from 1964. Total {{production}} was 3,878 vehicles before the company folded. 99 <b>right-hand</b> <b>drives</b> were converted from left-hand drives. Some {{were used in the}} Berlin police department and others were fitted for rescue operations. The Boathouse at Disney Springs at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida currently offers Amphicar rides to visiting patrons.|$|R
50|$|The Saurer 2 CM is a 4x4 truck model {{established}} by the Adolph Saurer AG in 1949 with a payload of 2.5 tons. There were 222 build most of them with a loading bridge, while some were made with a fixed structure as a van. The vehicles are <b>right-hand</b> <b>driven.</b> A winch was optional. The Saurer CM2 was also built by Berna and FBW (Franz Brozincevic Wetzikon) under their own names (FBW AX / Berna 2). The Saurer CM 2 {{formed the basis for}} other vehicles with more powerful engine and a larger payload capacity like Saurer 4CM 5t, Saurer 4CM driving school cars, Saurer Woodcarrier 4CM, 5CM 6t Saurer trucks and a mobile command center of the flab.One is on display at the Schweizerisches Militärmuseum Full.|$|R
25|$|The FJ cruiser was {{primarily}} {{developed for the}} North American market but has been sold in small numbers globally since its launch. On 25 November 2010, Toyota announced sales would begin in <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> form for the Japanese market. Sales began on December 4, replacing the outgoing Hilux Surf and selling alongside the Land Cruiser. Japanese-produced <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> models have a different rear bumper to North American models with the license plate located on the bumper as opposed to under the tailgate door handle. In addition, <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> versions have the side indicator markers located on the fender panels, rather than located on the side-view mirrors used for left-hand drive production FJ Cruisers. Sales of <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> model began in Australia and New Zealand in 2011 available in four-wheel drive automatics only.|$|E
25|$|The company {{faced the}} choice of {{building}} <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> models from scratch, or performing a post-production conversion exercise. Given the cost of new body molds, tooling, {{and a host of}} specific parts that a factory-built <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> configuration would require, the company opted to investigate the idea of a post-production conversion using a company based in Hampshire called Wooler-Hodec Ltd.|$|E
25|$|General Motors {{revived the}} Chevrolet Caprice {{nameplate}} in the Middle East markets on imported Holden Statesman/Caprice built by its Australian subsidiary Holden. The WH series Statesman/Caprice {{was the first}} series to be engineered to support both left- and <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> (Middle Eastern market being LHD while Australia <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive)</b> {{in order to allow}} for manufacturing of export versions. Same was true for the related short-wheelbase Holden VT Commodore, whose left-hand drive version became the Chevrolet Lumina in the Middle East.|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{developed}} by chief engineer George W. Dunham. It was a light (1000 lb) two-passenger runabout with a water-cooled, [...] single-cylinder engine fitted under the seat, a planetary transmission and a single chain to the rear axle. The wheel base was 72 in. The most outstanding item of the vehicle was its wheel-steering device. A 7-gallon fuel tank was fitted, which would give a driving range of about 150 mi. As usual at the time, the car was <b>right-hand</b> <b>driven.</b> Minimalistic coachwork included a small compartment in front. The car came painted in [...] "French carmine", with the running gear in [...] "Valentine red", and the seat bench trimmed in black leather. The car's initial price was $1000, and the company came never close to the targeted capacity of 200 cars per year.|$|R
5000|$|English {{threaded}} bicycle bottom brackets are left-threaded on the <b>right-hand</b> (usually <b>drive)</b> side {{into the}} bottom bracket shell. This {{is the opposite of}} pedals into cranks because the sense of the relative motion between the parts is opposite. (Italian and French threaded bottom brackets have right-hand threading on both sides.) ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is also a}} convention, if the hub has a maker's {{label on}} its barrel, for the label to face (and be {{readable}} through) the valve hole. See Gerd Schraner for methodology. The rim labels should be readable from the <b>right-hand</b> side (<b>drive</b> side) of the bicycle. The hub labels should face {{in the same direction}} front and rear (generally so they are readable from the seat), this means that even an undished, symmetrical front wheel has to be laced to the rim the [...] "proper" [...] way round, if perfection is the aim.|$|R
25|$|While as a {{lecturer}} in the University of Lagos, Awojobi successfully converted his own family car, an Opel Olympia Rekord, from <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> to a left-hand drive.|$|E
25|$|GM of Canada also {{executed}} <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> {{versions of}} Pontiac for export. These cars were popular in Australia, where GM faced {{competition from the}} big Ford Galaxie and Dodge Phoenix.|$|E
25|$|Shelby American has for {{the first}} time {{provided}} <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> version Super Snakes to the UK and Europe through official distributor Bill Shepherd Mustang, and also to Australia, introduced by Mustang Motorsport.|$|E
5000|$|On 3 September 1967, Frida won the Swedish {{national}} talent competition, [...] "New Faces", {{arranged by}} record company EMI, and held at Skansen, Stockholm. The song {{she chose to}} sing was [...] "En Ledig Dag" [...] ("A Day Off", original title: [...] "Week-End in Portofino"). The first prize in this contest was a recording contract with EMI Sweden. Unbeknownst to Lyngstad, {{the winner of the}} contest was also expected to appear the same evening in the country's most popular TV show at that time, Hylands Hörna. This happened on the same day Sweden switched from driving on the left-hand side of the road to the <b>right-hand</b> side. <b>Driving</b> on that day was discouraged, so most of the nation was watching TV that night. Frida performed her winning song live. The performance can be seen on Frida - The DVD.|$|R
5000|$|By October 1950 {{the further}} {{improved}} 4AB Roadster appeared. While superficially similar, this has an {{independent front suspension}} by coil springs and a hybrid, [...] "hydro-mechanical" [...] brake system by Girling. Externally, there is a shortened bonnet and disc wheels, as well as fixed sides to the bonnet. The fenders were also redesigned, becoming curvier and deeper. The steering box also received alterations, mainly aimed at centering it in the chassis so as to simplify manufacturing alternately <b>right-hand</b> or left-hand <b>driven</b> examples. The 4AB continued in production alongside the larger 4AD until January 1953.|$|R
2500|$|The Mark III, {{introduced}} in March 1967, {{was the first}} major facelift to the Spitfire. The front bumper was raised in response to new crash regulations, as well as the front coil springs being slightly raised, which made the car sometimes look a little out of proportion. Although much of the bonnet pressing was carried over, the front end looked quite different. The rear lost the overriders from the bumper but gained reversing lights as standard (initially as two separate lights {{on either side of the}} number plate, latterly as a single light in a new unit above the number plate); the interior was improved again with a wood-veneer instrument surround and a smaller 15-inch wire spoked steering wheel. A folding hood replaced the earlier [...] "build it yourself" [...] arrangement. For most of the Mark III range, the instrument cluster was still centre-mounted (as in the Mark I and Mark II) so as to reduce parts bin counts (and thereby production costs) for <b>right-hand</b> and left-hand <b>drive</b> versions.|$|R
25|$|This {{generation}} is export-only, not sold in Japan {{where it is}} manufactured, but has been offered in <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> since late 2013, being sold in Australia, Brunei, South Africa, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia.|$|E
25|$|A white 2108 {{would become}} the nine millionth Lada built, on 24 May 1985, with the ten millionth, on 9 October 1986, also a 2108. The twelve millionth, a <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> 2109, was {{produced}} 6 July 1989.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Lancia {{moved in}} a new {{direction}} and added new models manufactured by Chrysler and sold under the Lancia badge in many European markets. Conversely, Lancia built models began to be sold in <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> markets under the Chrysler badge.|$|E
25|$|Between 2004 and 2007, AC Motor Holdings {{produced}} the AC Mk V in their Malta factory. However, only 3 <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> carbon-fibre AC Mk Vs powered by 340bhp 5-litre Ford V8 engines were built before the Maltese operation closed.|$|E
25|$|Models have {{typically}} been released into Japan and selected World markets such as New Zealand and Chile {{in advance of}} the Continental European and North American markets, with the first two being <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> and traditional strong markets for Subaru.|$|E
25|$|The 1955-1957s {{were made}} in <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> and shipped from Oshawa, Canada, for local {{assembly}} in Australia (CKD), New Zealand (SKD), and South Africa. All three model years had a reversed version of the '55 LHD dashboard and {{did not get the}} LHD models' 1957 redesign.|$|E
25|$|Proton began {{importing}} cars to the <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> UK market from March 1989, {{and reached}} its 12-month sales target of 5,000 cars after just six months.The Proton brand was initially {{a huge success}} in the UK, but sales were declining sharply by 2010 and the brand was withdrawn in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Over {{half of the}} 16 <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> {{cars had}} these {{modifications}} carried out. In recent years several owners of these cars have replaced the Rubbolite lights with original federal style tail lights {{in an effort to}} return the cars to their original specification. Some owners have also fitted federal style license plate bezels on their cars.|$|E
25|$|Proton first {{ventured into}} export markets in December 1986, {{a year and}} a half after the launch of the company's first car, the Saga. It was only sold in <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> markets like New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Singapore because {{left-hand}} drive variants were not produced. Proton attempted to enter the American market in November 1988, but failed to meet strict US automotive regulations. However, the Proton Wira, which launched in 1993 became the company's first car to be produced in both left and <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> configurations, paving the way for Proton's entry into Continental Europe in October 1994 and other markets in the Middle East and Latin America. The company's global sales network peaked between 1994 and the early 2000s, but has since dwindled to around 25 countries as of the 2010s. Proton has commissioned CKD plants in Iran, Indonesia, The Philippines, Vietnam, and China.|$|E
25|$|By 2006, the Hummer {{began to}} be {{exported}} and sold through importers and distributors in 33 countries. On October 10, 2006, GM began producing the Hummer H3 at its Port Elizabeth plant in South Africa for international markets. The Hummers built there at first were only left-hand drive, but <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> versions were added and exported to Australia and other markets.|$|E
25|$|DMC-12s were {{primarily}} {{intended for the}} American market. All production models were therefore left-hand drive. Evidence survives from as early as April 1981, however, which indicates that the DeLorean Motor Company {{was aware of the}} need to produce a <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> version to supply to world markets such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.|$|E
25|$|All of the 13 Wooler-Hodec {{cars were}} {{modified}} to the OEM front turn signal lens fixing method {{in order to}} make them fit flush with the front fascia. The cars' headlights were also changed for <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> spec lights that incorporate a UK sidelight feature. The rest of the lights appear to have been left untouched by Wooler-Hodec during the conversion process.|$|E
25|$|The first Falcon sold in Australia was the XK series, {{introduced}} in September 1960. It was initially offered {{only as a}} four-door sedan, in both Falcon and Falcon Deluxe trim levels. The XK was essentially a <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> version of the North American model, although local country dealers often included modifications such as heavy-duty rear suspension (five leaves) and larger 6.50 x 13-inch tyres.|$|E
25|$|The {{fourth-generation}} Mondeo from Europe and the sixth-generation Mustang from North America both indirectly {{replaced the}} Falcon. Beginning from 2015, {{the new model}} of the <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> Mustang returned to the Australian market after a 13-year absence, as part of Ford's efforts to boost sales of the Mustang brand worldwide and still give Ford Australia a flagship car to replace the Falcon XR and FPV GT V8 range.|$|E
25|$|In the UK {{there are}} {{a high level of}} Japanese imports used within the {{drifting}} scene, {{due in part to the}} UK sharing a <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> layout with Japan. However, these cars often cost more than UK-market cars, partly due to import costs. There are plenty of UK and European models used as drift cars as well, older BMW's are particularly prominent due to cost and availability, with Volvo 300 series and Ford Sierras also proving popular.|$|E
25|$|About 9,200 DMC-12s were {{produced}} between January 1981 and December 1982. Almost {{a fifth of}} these {{were produced}} in October 1981. About a thousand 1982 models were produced between February and May 1982, {{and all of these}} cars had the VINs changed after purchase by Consolidated to make them appear as 1983 models. There are the 15XXX, 16XXX, and 17XXX VINs which were originally 10XXX, 11XXX, and 12XXX VINs. Only a dozen 12XXXX VIN cars still exist. These are the Wooler-Hodec <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> cars (see below).|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the GT {{received}} a restyling. Outside there were new one-piece tail lights, grey plastic bumpers, C-pillar vents and side skirts; all bright stainless steel {{save for the}} Alfa Romeo triangular grille was changed to matte-black trim. The 1.6-litre version was discontinued and the Alfetta GTV became known simply as Alfa Romeo GTV2.0; the Alfetta name was dropped, but the two-litre coupé retained its type designation of 11636 for left-hand drive and 11637 for <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive.</b> 15-inch disc-shaped alloy wheels were now standard, {{as opposed to the}} earlier cars' 14-inch pressed steel or optional 14-inch alloy.|$|E
25|$|After the {{development}} of the HQ series and the delays to the facelifted HJ which saw the revised HQ released in 1973, Holden intended to replace the second generations cars with a heavily revised WA series. Several design sketches in various forms have surfaced since the early-1990s, including a liftback body style. The 1973 fuel crisis along with a worsening financial situation, partly cause by the decision to build the HQ in <b>right-hand</b> <b>drive</b> only, thus limiting the previously highly profitable left-hand drive exports, meant that the project was eventually abandoned. GM instead utilised the then forthcoming 1977 Opel Rekord, which was significantly re-engineered and released as the Commodore in 1978 with Holden's own powertrains.|$|E
