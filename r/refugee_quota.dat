The Party took part in organizing the massive anti-immigration rally in Rīga, August 2015. This anti-immigration position was accented in the annual foreign affair debates in Saeima, also turning against liberal immigration policy and political correctness in EU.|$|E

40|$|Building on Moravcsik’s Liberal Intergovernmentalism, I {{offer an}} {{explanation}} of the non-decision on permanent EU <b>refugee</b> <b>quotas.</b> Some traditionally influential Member States in EU asylum politics, e. g. Germany, Austria and Sweden, received large numbers of refugees and faced strong domestic pressures to engage other Member States in responsibility-sharing. Yet, governments of Member States with small application numbers (among whom several Eastern European governments were particularly vocal) had incentives to undercut responsibility-sharing to avoid similar pressures. Having a better alternative to the potentially negotiated agreement, these governments successfully blocked the introduction of permanent <b>refugee</b> <b>quotas.</b> Besides explaining the absence of an effective response to one of the root causes of the asylum crisis (i. e. unequal strains) through asymmetrical interdependence, the article further develops Liberal Intergovernmentalist arguments and shows how national electorates influence positions taken by governments at the EU level when they are mobilised by right-wing populist parties...|$|R

50|$|Islam in New Zealand {{began with}} the arrival of Muslim Chinese gold prospectors in the 1870s. The first Islamic {{organisation}} in New Zealand, the New Zealand Muslim Association, was established in Auckland in 1950. 1960 saw the arrival of the first imam, Maulana Said Musa Patel, from Gujarat, India. Large-scale Muslim immigration began in the 1970s {{with the arrival of}} Fiji Indians, followed in the 1990s by refugees from various war-torn countries. In April 1979 the three regional Muslim organisations of Canterbury, Wellington and Auckland, joined together to create the only national Islamic body - the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand. Early in the 1990s many migrants were admitted under New Zealand's <b>refugee</b> <b>quota,</b> from war zones in Somalia, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Kosovo and Iraq. Since the 11 September attacks there was a spike in conversions to Islam among Maori prisoners in jail.|$|E
40|$|In 1997 Peter Schuck {{proposed}} a ‘refugee quota trading ’ mechanism, whereby countries voluntarily form a union, each country accepting a quota of refugees {{and able to}} buy and sell the quota to other states within and even outside of the union. Today, the EU arguably has a de facto cash transfer mechanism both within the EU and between the EU and European Neighbourhood Policy countries. This article explores the question of <b>refugee</b> <b>quota</b> trading, explaining why current EU policy fails to increase refugee protection. Throughout the critique, states are treated either as rational actors or actors with present-preference bias, the latter largely ignored in current discussions on international refugee ‘burden sharing’. In addition, the ethics of <b>refugee</b> <b>quota</b> trading is presented using arguments distinct from that of Anker et al. (1998) who argue that <b>refugee</b> <b>quota</b> trading creates a ‘commodification ’ of refugees. One could argue that refugees ’ protection is being commodified, not refugees themselves. However, when states are provided funds not to deport refugees, this can be a type of reward for not taking an action that states ought to follow regardless of the reward. Just as there are non-utilitarian reasons not to rely on rewards alone for lowering the crime rates for heinous crimes within states, there may be non-utilitarian arguments against <b>refugee</b> <b>quota</b> trading...|$|E

40|$|EU states {{agreed on}} 23 September to {{implement}} a <b>refugee</b> <b>quota</b> system which will distribute 120, 000 refugees across the EU, despite four member states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia – voting against the proposal. Luc Bovens and Anna Bartsch write that regardless of the wider debate over whether a quota system is justified or not, {{it is vital that}} the ‘distribution key’ determining how many refugees are assigned to each state is fair. They argue that the distribution key proposed by the European Commission is ill-conceived and regressive, and that a fairer system with recalculated quotas may go some way toward convincing the dissenting states to support the system...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand {{is one of}} the 26 {{nations of}} the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) who {{participate}} in a regular refugee resettlement program (“New Zealand <b>Refugee</b> <b>Quota</b> Programme”). It {{is also one of the}} few countries to have a refugee orientation program upon arrival and dedicates a centre especially to host the incoming refugees. The current <b>refugee</b> <b>quota</b> system in New Zealand provides a 6 week orientation and assessment period followed by dispersal into 6 different cities across New Zealand for permanent resettlement. Refugees develop friendships and a sense of comfort over the 6 weeks program with all the facilities available at the Resettlement centre. The transition from the centre into the independent housing in suburban locations therefore becomes more challenging due to the lack of induction of refugees into their host communities. Refugees are alienated in their new communities with the locals equally as oblivious to the new settlers. As a result, post settlement engagement with the host society becomes difficult for refugees. The community relations between the refugees and host society is neglected with refugees generally connecting with the same ethnic group (ii, Gray); limiting cross-cultural connections. This research investigates the role of architecture as a facilitator of social interaction between the refugees and local community to create a strong sense of belonging in the host society. The aim is to explore architectural solutions which can ease the process of resettlement for refugees into the different regions around New Zealand. It seeks to develop a design which offers social engagement that can extend into the society and cross-cultural interaction can be encouraged...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission has {{proposed}} a quota system for distributing the responsibility for asylum seekers across EU member states.

She notes that although there would remain reservations about such a system, it would ensure that states who accept disproportionately more asylum seekers are compensated for doing so, while those who accept fewer pay for the privilege...|$|R
