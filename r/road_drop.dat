50|$|Greater Sudbury Road 13, {{also known}} as Vermilion Lake Road, is a {{municipal}} road {{in the city of}} Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. It was voted as the worst road in Ontario in the Canadian Automobile Association's annual Ontario's Worst Roads survey in 2007. In the 2008 survey, Vermilion Lake <b>Road</b> <b>dropped</b> to third place behind Steeles Avenue in Toronto and Brock Street in Kingston, while in 2009 the <b>road</b> <b>dropped</b> to ninth place. In 2010, however, the road rose to second place again, behind only Pelican Falls Road in Sioux Lookout.|$|R
50|$|At Slaughterbridge the B3314 <b>road</b> <b>drops</b> {{dramatically}} {{into the}} valley of the River Camel, describing a steeply graded 'S' bend and narrowing over the eponymous single-track bridge over the river.|$|R

50|$|Standard <b>road</b> <b>drop</b> {{handlebars}} (including track, cyclocross and touring bars) use a 23.8 mm grip/lever diameter, {{which is}} matched only to road bike type shifters or brake levers. This diameter {{is usually not}} important for grips since these bars most often are wrapped in tape. An exception are one-piece track grips, which are sized to fit the 23.8 mm bar diameter (and, therefore, would not fit a mountain bike handlebar). Cyclocross brake levers are sized to fit drop style bars, and would also not fit a mountain bike handlebar.|$|E
50|$|The North Woods Hiawatha {{began in}} June 1936, {{branching}} {{off from the}} main Hiawatha route in New Lisbon, Wisconsin to serve Minocqua, Wisconsin. The Milwaukee <b>Road</b> <b>dropped</b> the Hiawatha moniker in 1956 and discontinued the service altogether in 1970.|$|R
50|$|The road passes Villers-Bocage passing though open countryside. After Beauval the <b>road</b> <b>drops</b> {{into the}} Authie valley {{and the town}} of Doullens. The road turns east {{thereafter}} and passes several British War Cemeteries. The road passes Beaumetz-lès-Loges before reaching the outskirts of Arras.|$|R
5000|$|After the summit, the <b>road</b> <b>drops</b> steeply by Bwlch Gwynt {{to another}} cattle grid and the {{intersection}} with the B4313 at Greenway, {{also known as}} New Inn, which in the 19th century sustained northbound travellers before [...] "the arduous task of winding up the painful ascent of Bwlch Gwynt".|$|R
50|$|South of Interstate 435, Wornall Road {{once again}} assumes a mostly {{residential}} nature, passing numerous apartment complexes and suburban housing developments. Between I-435 and Red Bridge Road (the equivalent of 111th Street), Wornall deviates somewhat to the east; south of Red Bridge <b>Road,</b> Wornall <b>Road</b> <b>drops</b> to two lanes.|$|R
50|$|Pflanzgarten 1 {{is made up}} of a {{slightly}} banked, downhill left hander which then suddenly switches back left, then right. Then immediately, giving the driver nearly no time to react (knowledge of this section is key) the <b>road</b> <b>drops</b> away twice: the first jump is only slight, then right after (somewhat like a staircase) the <b>road</b> <b>drops</b> away very sharply which usually causes almost all cars to go airborne at this jump; the drop is so sudden. Then, immediately after the road levels out very shortly after the jump and the car touches the ground again, the road immediately and suddenly goes right very quickly and then right again; this is what makes up {{the end of the first}} Pflanzgarten- a very fast multiple apex sequence of right hand corners.|$|R
50|$|The road {{then ran}} from Wolstanton along the valley ridge to drop {{down into the}} often-flooded Fowlea Valley. Local historians suspect that the <b>road</b> <b>dropped</b> into the valley at Basford to meet a raised {{causeway}} across the valley bottom at Etruria. From there it reached {{the site of the}} modern Stoke-on-Trent railway station.|$|R

6000|$|As {{they turned}} {{the corner of a}} street, the folding-doors of a large gateway rolled open; a long line of {{glittering}} figures poured across the <b>road,</b> <b>dropped</b> their spear-butts on the pavement with a single rattle, and remained motionless. The front rank of the mob recoiled; and an awe-struck whisper ran through them.... 'The Stationaries!' ...|$|R
5000|$|The race {{begins in}} the centre of Princetown (Ordnance Survey mapping six-figure grid {{reference}} [...] {{at an altitude of}} 420 metres) and goes along the B3212 to Two Bridges ( [...] 340m). The race then turns east along the B3357. This section is relatively flat until the <b>road</b> <b>drops</b> down into Dartmeet ( [...] 225m) at about 9.5km.|$|R

50|$|There {{the road}} heads east over the Col de la Savine (984 m) in the Crête de la Joux Devant(1,094 m). The <b>road</b> <b>drops</b> {{into the next}} valley and the towns of Morbier and Morez. The road rises over the Crête des Sauges into Les Rousses {{alongside}} the Swiss border with a road heading over the Col de la Givrine (1228 m).|$|R
5000|$|Today Nyalam is {{a fast-growing}} little town made of {{concrete}} buildings {{located on the}} Friendship Highway between Lhasa and the Nepal border. South of Nyalam the <b>road</b> <b>drops</b> abruptly through the gorge of the Matsang Tsangpo or Sun Kosi {{as it is known}} in Nepal. [...] The town is about 40 km from the Nepalese border and 150 km from Kathmandu.|$|R

50|$|The N19 heads south east out of {{the town}} past the A26 and round {{the bottom of the}} Parc Naturale Regional de la Foret d'Orient. The <b>road</b> <b>drops</b> into the River Aube valley at Bar sur Aube. The {{countryside}} is now hilly with dense woodland with the Foret de Clairvaux to the south. The road passes Colombey-les-Deux-Églises and its monument to Charles de Gaulle.|$|R
50|$|Branching {{from the}} A487 {{half a mile}} {{south-west}} of Eglwyswrw, the <b>road</b> <b>drops</b> down to cross the River Nevern by a single-lane stone bridge {{just north of the}} hamlet of Crosswell. The road enters the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, then climbs steadily through farmland, over a 400-year-old bridge crossing the Afon Brynberian, and past the hamlet of Brynberian with views of the mountains to the south and east.|$|R
50|$|FM 78 {{provides}} a connection (in conjunction with IH 35) between central San Antonio and Randolph Air Force Base. It also {{provides a}}n alternate route (versus IH 10 and Loop 1604) between Seguin and {{portions of the}} northeastern San Antonio metropolitan area. Between San Antonio and Cibolo, FM 78 is a four-lane <b>road,</b> <b>dropping</b> to a two-lane road until McQueeney, before becoming a four-lane divided route to IH 10/SH 46.|$|R
50|$|The Cat and Fiddle again {{topped the}} list in the 2010 report, which claimed that {{fatalities}} on the road rose from 15 {{in the three years}} to 2005 to 34 between 2006 and 2008. However, following the introduction of further safety measures including improved road barriers, a 50mph speed limit and the installation of average speed cameras, the <b>road</b> <b>dropped</b> out of the Foundation's top ten list in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Upstream {{from the}} valley lies the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne, while the smaller Poopenaut Valley is {{directly}} downstream from O'Shaughnessy Dam. The Hetch Hetchy <b>Road</b> <b>drops</b> into the valley at the dam, but all points east of there are roadless, and accessible only to hikers and equestrians. The O'Shaughnessy Dam is near Yosemite's western boundary, but the long, narrow, fingerlike reservoir stretches eastward for about 8 mi.|$|R
5000|$|Just {{north of}} Washington Irving's Sunnyside is the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow {{featured}} in his [...] "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" [...] (1820). Running concurrent with U.S. Route 9, the Albany Post <b>Road</b> <b>drops</b> the name [...] "Broadway" [...] as it approaches {{the village of}} Ossining.

50|$|Established in 1932 as a {{renumbering}} of NC 29; {{which itself}} was created two years prior when US 74/NC 20 was realigned between Lowell, McAdenville, and Belmont. In 1935, NC 7 was extended west, on new road, to Kings Mountain; however, in 1938, it was reverted {{to its original}} western terminus when US 29/US 74 was realigned onto the new <b>road,</b> <b>dropping</b> the route through Bessemer City. The route has changed little since its inception.|$|R
50|$|The {{team had}} mixed {{results in the}} regular season, {{compiling}} a 7-9 record, but placed second in the PASL's Southwest Division. The Toros fared better at home than on the <b>road,</b> <b>dropping</b> six of their eight away matches. The team advanced to the postseason and {{earned the right to}} play for the Ron Newman Cup in the PASL National Championship. The Toros lost two straight games to the Las Vegas Legends in the Divisional Finals, ending their playoff run.|$|R
50|$|The final {{trips for}} the Midwest Hiawatha were on October 29, 1955. The {{next day the}} Milwaukee Road assumed {{operation}} of Union Pacific Railroad's City of San Francisco, City of Los Angeles, City of Denver, City of Portland and Challenger trains. The Midwest Hiawatha became two Sioux Falls-Chicago coaches which combined with the Challenger in Manilla. The Milwaukee <b>Road</b> <b>dropped</b> the name altogether in April 1956, when the eastward was rescheduled to leave Omaha at 2:45 AM CST.|$|R
60|$|They gained on that upslope, {{but as the}} <b>road</b> <b>dropped,</b> the bug started forward desperately. Another car {{was headed}} toward them; {{was drawn to the}} side of the road, in one of the {{occasional}} widenings. Pinky passed it so carelessly that, with crawling spine, Claire saw the outer wheels of the bug on the very edge of the road--the edge of a fifty-foot drop. Milt went easily past the halted car--even waved his hand to the waiting driver.|$|R
25|$|The road widens {{through a}} wooded area and then narrows past another service area just before Todd Hill <b>Road.</b> The <b>road</b> <b>drops</b> to cross a creek, then rises again to the NY55 exit, one of two roads serving the city of Poughkeepsie to the west, near Freedom Plains. Its slow {{undulation}} with the landscape continues past the now closed Skidmore Road grade crossing as it heads due north into the town of Pleasant Valley and the less developed half of Dutchess County.|$|R
50|$|Just {{south of}} Berriedale, {{on the way}} to the north, the A9 passes the Berriedale Braes, a steep drop in the {{landscape}} (brae is a Scots word for hillside, a borrowing of the Scottish Gaelic bràighe). The <b>road</b> <b>drops</b> down steeply (13% over 1,3 km) to bridge a river, before rising again (13% over 1,3 km), with a number of sharp bends in the road - although some of the hairpin bends and other nearby gradients have been eased in recent years.|$|R
50|$|The {{drop off}} from the Plains to the Piedmont is {{noticeable}} to motorists driving southward from Cheyenne, Wyoming on Interstate 25. At approximately Mile 293 northeast of Wellington, Colorado, near the Larimer-Weld county line, the <b>road</b> <b>drops</b> noticeably from the Upper Cretaceous sandstone of the Plains to the lower shale of the Piedmont. The transition from High Plains to Piedmont is likewise accompanied by a change in agriculture, from pasture lands on the Plains to cultivated fields in the Piedmont.|$|R
