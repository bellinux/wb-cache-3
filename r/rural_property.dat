In 1739, local gardener Thomas Huddle began to build property on the north side.

5|$|Born in New South Wales but {{raised in}} Western Australia, Phillipps joined the Australian Imperial Force as an infantryman in April 1915, seeing action at Gallipoli {{and on the}} Western Front.

25|$|During this period, {{the town}} was mostly owned by three families: the Mallocks who owned the Cockington region, the Carys who owned Babbacombe, St Marychurch and the old monastery at Torre Abbey, and the Palk family which owned central Torquay or Tormohun. Tor Mohun {{takes its name from}} the tor or {{conspicuous}} hill known as Tor Hill today, and its suffix from the Mohuns who acquired the manor from the Brewers in the 13th century. The Mallocks resisted the changes convulsing Torquay for a long time because they did not want a town on their <b>rural</b> <b>property,</b> and they threw away a fortune rather than have it. It was not until 1865 that one of them consented to grant a building lease, and that only to a family connection.|$|E

25|$|Rodezno and {{his wife}} held land estates {{scattered}} across Spain: in Navarre, Extremadura and Andalusia. Some authors refer to him as “grande terrateniente” “cacique terrateniente”, “grandee proprietor” or “prominent landowner”, an exemplary case of link between landownership and power, though exact size of his holdings is unclear and probably did not exceed 500 ha combined. He was head of Federacion Catolico Agraria de Navarra, co-founder of Asociación de Terratenientes de Navarra and member of Asociacion de Propietarios de Alcornocales. On behalf {{of some of these}} pressure groups he held talks with various ministers, publishing also analytical studies on agricultural credit and land ownership. In his opinion in terms of <b>rural</b> <b>property</b> the Navarrese structure was close to ideal, almost reaching the objective “que todos los agricultores fueran propietarios”.|$|E
25|$|On May 22, 2015, {{a three-hour}} shootout broke {{out between the}} Mexican Federal Police and alleged members of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) in Tanhuato and Ecuandureo, Michoacán, leaving 43 dead.

The confrontation started when the Federal Police spotted a suspicious vehicle on a highway. The authorities had received information {{that one of the}} properties in the area had been overrun by criminals. Unconfirmed reports suggested that the CJNG leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes was in the area. When they tried to pull over the vehicle, however, the men onboard opened fire at the police units.

25|$|Secondly, {{they argued}} that the offered {{compensation}} was insufficient for the amount and value of the land taken. However, the valuations of United Fruit Company's <b>rural</b> <b>property</b> {{were based on the}} values declared by the company in its own tax filings. In 1945 Arevalo's administration ordered new assessments, to be complete by 1948. UFCo had submitted the assessment by the due date; but, when the Agrarian Reform was implemented, the company declared that they wanted the value of its property changed from the values the company had previously used to dodge taxes. The government had investigated in 1951, but a new assessment was never completed. UFCo said that the 1948 assessment was outdated, and claimed its land value was much greater. They had estimated just compensation would be as high as Q 15,854,849, nearly twenty times more than what the Guatemalan government had offered.|$|E

25|$|Extremely unequal land {{ownership}} {{is both a}} cause and {{a consequence of the}} Colombian armed conflict. In 1960, 0.4% of landowners held 30% of all farmland. By 1997, the concentration of {{land ownership}} was further accentuated, with 0.35% of landowners holding 45% of all farmland with 86% owning just 13%. In 2012, 1% of landowners (those owning large properties over 200 hectares) held 43% of the land, and an additional 13% of landowners (those owning medium-sized properties over 20 hectares) held 39% of the land. 79% of landowners had properties of less than 10 hectares (considered microfundio and minifundio), which accounted for just 11% of private rural land. The 2014 Agricultural Census reported that 0.4% of agricultural production units (over 500 hectares) occupy 77.6% of the country's rural area, while 71% of agricultural production units (less than 5 hectares) occupy just 2% of rural land area. On the largest landholdings (over 1,000 hectares), an average of only 28% of the land is used for agricultural purposes with the remainder of the land covered by natural vegetation, confirming common accusations that the land is underutilized. The 2014 census also showed that, since 1960, the fragmentation of smallholdings had increased - production units of less than 5 hectares increased from 63% of 71% {{of the total number of}} such units - while the weight of large landholdings (over 500 hectares) in the total rural land area had increased significantly from 40% to 77.6%. The inequitable land distribution has increased since 2000, as measured by the Gini coefficient for land ownership - 0.885 in 2009, compared to 0.877 in 2000. Colombia is one of the countries with the highest inequality in <b>rural</b> <b>property</b> in Latin America and the world.|$|E

40|$|Fasciolosis is {{a disease}} that affects the liver {{parenchyma}} and bile ducts of numerous animals, including humans, which causes economic losses and threatens public health. The present work aimed at reporting the distribution and factors connected with Fasciola hepatica infection in cattle in ten municipalities in southern Espírito Santo, Brazil, between 2008 and 2009. During this period, 50 <b>rural</b> <b>properties</b> in ten cities were analyzed and fecal samples from 10 % of the cattle on each farm were collected. Of the 717 samples analyzed, 154 (21. 33 %) presented Fasciola hepatica eggs. As for the 50 <b>rural</b> <b>properties</b> studied, 32 (64 %) had animals positive for fasciolosis. Throughout the evaluation, {{it was observed that}} 42 (84 %) <b>rural</b> <b>properties</b> had flooded areas, 33 (66 %) were located at altitudes less than 226 meters, in 36 (72 %) mollusks were found, 47 (94 %) had other definitive hosts (horses, sheep, goats) and 25 (50 %) had previous cases of bovine fasciolosis. The present results showed a high rate of bovine fasciolosis in the analyzed region whereas infected animals are present in all the municipalities. Based on statistical analysis, it was concluded that there was an association between the presence of flooded areas and other definitive hosts in <b>rural</b> <b>properties</b> where bovine fasciolosis was detected...|$|R
