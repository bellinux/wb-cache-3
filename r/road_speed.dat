5|$|The T19 Howitzer Gun Motor Carriage {{was similar}} to the M3 Half-track, as it shared the same chassis, engine, {{suspension}}, armor, and fuel tank. It was 20ft 2 in long, 6ft 5 in wide, 7ft 8 in high, with a weight of 9.54short tons. The suspension consisted of semi-elliptical longitudinal leaf springs for the wheels and vertical volute springs for the tracks. It was powered by a White 160AX, 147hp, 386 in3, six-cylinder gasoline engine with a compression ratio of 6.3:1. It was capable of a maximum <b>road</b> <b>speed</b> of 45mph. The power-to-weight ratio was 14.7hp/ton.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 1937, Captain Félix Verdeja, {{commanding}} the maintenance {{company of the}} Nationalist Batallón de Carros de Combate ("Tank Battalion"), began to privately develop a new light tank. His position, with direct access to Panzer Is and T-26s, gave Verdeja direct evidence of the shortcomings of current tank models in terms of combat ability and maintenance issues. Verdeja established a future tank requiring the 45millimetre (1.77in) gun fitted in the T-26; two coaxial light machine guns; a low profile, all-around armor greater than 15millimetres (0.6in), with a turret mantlet plate of at least 30millimetres (1.2in); <b>road</b> <b>speed</b> of , combat range of , and a capable suspension and new track system. This latter requirement was based on experiences with existing light tanks, which frequently lost their tracks in combat. These requirements and solutions were presented in October 1938 to Colonel Díaz de la Lastra, commanding officer of the Agrupación de Carros de Combate. Although the project was approved, the program had to use scrap to build the first prototype {{due to a lack}} of resources and money. Despite early obstacles, including criticism from von Thoma, the program continued and Verdeja was awarded a warehouse in Zaragoza to continue with the construction of the prototype.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{established}} pit <b>road</b> <b>speed</b> limit for each race. Since NASCAR cars {{do not have}} speedometers, the first pace lap of each race is run at pit <b>road</b> <b>speed</b> so drivers can get a tachometer reading for pit speed. There {{are a variety of}} other safety rules (see penalties above) that must be followed.|$|E

50|$|An {{electronically}} controlled {{rear muffler}} {{is used to}} keep the B4 quiet at low <b>road</b> <b>speeds.</b> The pipe that leads into the rear muffler is divided in two, with one pipe equipped with a flapper valve. The ECU - working with an actuator and cable - opens this valve when travelling at medium-to-high <b>road</b> <b>speeds.</b> This increases exhaust gas flow.|$|R
25|$|Dimensions, <b>road</b> <b>speed</b> {{and engine}} {{horsepower}} {{of the various}} models did not vary significantly, except for the T-43, which was slower than the T-34.|$|E
25|$|<b>Road</b> <b>speed</b> {{limits are}} used in most {{countries}} to set the maximum (or minimum in some cases) speed at which road vehicles may legally travel on particular stretches of <b>road.</b> <b>Speed</b> limits may be variable and in some places speed is unlimited (e.g. on some Autobahn sections in Germany). Speed limits are normally indicated on a traffic sign. Speed limits are commonly set by the legislative bodies of nations or provincial governments and enforced by national or regional police or judicial bodies.|$|E
25|$|PT-76B {{fitted with}} a new V-6M diesel engine {{developing}} 300hp (224kW) which increased the maximum <b>road</b> <b>speed</b> from 44km/h to 45km/h and the maximum swimming speed from 10,2km/h to 11,2km/h. This increased the power-to-weight ratio from 17.1hp/tonne (12.3kW/tonne) to 19.5hp/tonne (14.5kW/tonne).|$|E

50|$|At the lap 20 restart, McMurray led Keselowski, Hamlin, and Logano {{into the}} first turn. On the {{following}} lap, Leicht made a pit stop, as Hamlin took the first position. Hamlin, who had won four previous times at Pocono Raceway, continued to extend his lead to 1.1 seconds by the 25th lap. Six laps later on lap 31, Joe Nemechek pitted, only two laps before Hamlin and Keselowski, and three before McMurray. On the 34th lap, Keselowski received a pit <b>road</b> <b>speeding</b> penalty, as Earnhardt, Jr. became the leader. Four laps later, Casey Mears drove to the garage, while Michael McDowell pitted. At lap 42, Gordon and Ambrose started {{the second set of}} green flag pit stops. On the following lap, Johnson pitted, as Gordon had to return to pit road after receiving a pit <b>road</b> <b>speeding</b> penalty. On the 44th lap, Kyle Busch, Logano and Ambrose pitted, as Johnson received a pit <b>road</b> <b>speeding</b> penalty. Johnson received a second penalty for <b>speeding</b> on pit <b>road</b> on the next lap. Kyle Busch, Harvick, David Reutimann and Newman were also given a pit <b>road</b> <b>speeding</b> penalty. Following pit stops, Hamlin was the leader ahead of Earnhardt, Jr.|$|R

25|$|<b>Road</b> <b>speed</b> limits {{through the}} park have been reduced twice, from 30mph to 20mph in the 1980s, and to 5mph in 2004. Also, on the pedestrianised areas (areas {{that used to be}} roads for cars, but are now closed to vehicles, except for emergency/ranger traffic), many speed bumps have been removed.|$|E
25|$|The charge {{operates}} {{for under}} {{one third of}} the hours in a year and covers around two-thirds of the central London traffic. In total 8% of traffic kilometres are affected by the scheme. TfL have extrapolated the trends in <b>road</b> <b>speed</b> in the congestion zone; they have suggested that speeds would have dropped from 17km/h in 2003 to 11.5km/h by 2006, had the scheme not been put in place.|$|E

50|$|The <b>road's</b> <b>speed</b> {{limit is}} 70 km/h from Bannister Road {{to the edge}} of Southern River's {{metropolitan}} limit at Balfour St. At that point, it increases to 80 km/h.|$|R
50|$|In August 2010, Cambridgeshire County Council {{announced}} {{the reduction of}} the <b>road's</b> <b>speed</b> limit from NSL (60 mph) to 50 mph in areas where concern was raised over the safety of traffic.|$|R
25|$|A diesel–electric locomotive's {{power output}} is {{independent}} of <b>road</b> <b>speed,</b> {{as long as the}} unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop tractive effort (also referred to as drawbar pull or tractive force, which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel–electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.|$|E
25|$|The N2 commences at {{junction}} 5 of the M50 motorway. It then runs as a dual-carriageway for 17km (10.5 miles) {{from the}} M50 to north of Ashbourne, County Meath. This project was opened on 25 May 2006, and includes 3.5km (2.2 miles) of three lane dual carriageway built to motorway standard. The route {{is the first}} to have a 120km/h (75mph) special speed limit (this was previously reserved for motorways, see <b>Road</b> <b>speed</b> limits in the Republic of Ireland for particulars). 13km (8.1 miles) of this dual carriageway stretch became motorway on 28 August 2009. (see M2 motorway).|$|E
25|$|Rudd joined King Racing {{beginning}} in 1988 in the No. 26 Buick Regal owned by drag racing legend Kenny Bernstein. He struggled with engine failures all season long and finished 11th in the point standings, his worst points finish in eight years. After his only win of 1989, which {{came at the}} inaugural Sears Point event, Rudd departed the operation, and in 1990 he signed with Hendrick Motorsports to drive the No. 5 Chevrolet Lumina. He was able to win The Bud at the Glen and finished seventh in the point standings. However, {{he was involved in}} a fatal pit road accident in the season-finale Atlanta Journal 500, in which he spun into Bill Elliott's pit and crushed one of Elliott's tire changer Mike Rich, killing him almost instantly. That fatal incident caused NASCAR to implement pit <b>road</b> <b>speed</b> limits at every NASCAR track, for all of the series.|$|E
50|$|The LTA {{reported}} that road traffic decreased by nearly 25,000 vehicles during peak hours, with average <b>road</b> <b>speeds</b> increasing by about 20%. Within the restricted zone itself, traffic {{has gone down}} by about 13% during ERP operational hours, with vehicle numbers dropping from 270,000 to 235,000. It has been observed that car-pooling has increased, while the hours of peak vehicular traffic has also gradually eased and spread into off-peak hours, suggesting a more productive use of road space. In addition, it has been noted that average <b>road</b> <b>speeds</b> for expressways and major roads remained the same, despite rising traffic volumes over the years.|$|R

50|$|Before {{national}} road 2 {{continued to}} Mäntyluoto, the road between Pori and Mäntyluoto was regional road 265. That part from national road 2 is very straight but slightly narrow and the <b>roads</b> <b>speed</b> limit in that line is 80 km/h.|$|R
25|$|The European Union {{used the}} Units of Measure Directive {{to attempt to}} achieve a common system of weights and {{measures}} and to facilitate the European Single Market. Throughout the 1990s, the European Commission helped accelerate the process for member countries to complete their metric conversion processes. Among them is the United Kingdom where laws in some or all contexts mandate or permit many imperial measures, such as miles and yards for road-sign distances, <b>road</b> <b>speed</b> limits in miles per hour, pints of beer, and inches for clothes. The United Kingdom secured permanent exemptions for the mile and yard in road markings, and (with Ireland) for the pint (Imperial) of draught beer sold in pubs (see Metrication in the United Kingdom). In 2007, the European Commission also announced that (to appease British public opinion and to facilitate trade with the United States) it was to abandon the requirement for metric-only labelling on packaged goods, and to allow dual metric–imperial marking to continue indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|The Type 62 light tank {{uses the}} torsion bar {{suspension}} {{which consists of}} five road wheels on each side with a prominent gap {{between the first and}} second road wheel and an even space between second, third, fourth and fifth road wheel. The road wheels are smaller and lighter than those from the Type 59 main battle tank. The track is driven by a drive sprocket at the rear, with an idler at the front. There are no return rollers. In effort to reduce the overall weight of the tank the original 12150L 12-cylinder liquid-cooled diesel engine from Type 59 main battle tank was powered down from 523hp (390kW) to 430hp (321kW). This modified version of the 12150L engine weights considerably less and was designated 12150L-3. This new engine gave the Type 62 a maximum <b>road</b> <b>speed</b> of 60km/h, maximum cross country speed of 35km/h, maximum road operational range of 500km and power-to-weight ratio of 20.5hp/tonne (15.3kW/tonne). The tank can cross 0.8 m high vertical obstacles, 2.85 m trenches, 30° side slopes and ford 1.4 m deep water obstacles (5 m when equipped with a snorkel).|$|E
25|$|The engine {{compartment}} {{is located in}} the rear of the vehicle and consists of: a 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine developing 450hp, a main clutch, a gearbox, a final drives, and brakes. The suspension of the vehicle consists of five rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear, an idler at the front, and four track-return rollers. The BMD-3 is fitted with a new hydromechanical transmission with hydrostatic steering mechanism. This adjustable suspension gives a ground clearance between 130 and 530mm with 450mm being the default. This hydropneumatic suspension allows the BMD-3 to decrease its height to be able to board transport aircraft like the Il-76M. The ground clearance is adjusted by the driver and it takes 10 seconds to lower or raise the suspension. The maximum <b>road</b> <b>speed</b> is 70km/h and the maximum off-road speed is 45km/h. The vehicle can achieve an operational range of up to 500km on paved roads and can climb up to 60% gradient and move on a 30% side slope. The ground pressure exerted by the BMD-3 is 0.48 kg/cm2 with standard tracks and 0.32kg/cm2 with broader tracks.|$|E
