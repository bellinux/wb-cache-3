This method of reporting can correct for under <b>reported</b> <b>cycles</b> started, adjust for differences in embryo transfer policies and pro-vides an objective and reproducible international benchmark. Combining live birth outcomes from fresh and frozen cycles in the same report-ing period per oocyte collection is also recommended.

The authors used data collected in 1990 from 352 women born in Chicago, Illinois, aged 37 – 39 years. Women <b>reported</b> their usual <b>cycle</b> length and behavioral and reproductive characteristics at study enrollment and then completed daily menstrual diaries for up to 6 months.

Agreement between observed and <b>reported</b> <b>cycle</b> length was moderate. The crude overall kappa coefficient was 0. 33; the kappa adjusted for within-woman sampling variability was 0. 45 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 36, 0. 55). On average, women overestimated their cycle length by 0. 7 days (95 % confidence interval: 0. 3, 1. 0). Reporting by sexually active women and women with a history of infertility was more accurate.

40|$|This paper explores {{how large}} UK {{financial}} institutions (FIs) pursued a private corporate governance agenda with their portfolio companies. It also investigates {{the role of}} financial reporting in private and public corporate governance. The case financial institutions argued that the limited quality of public information, especially in financial reports, was a major constraint {{on their ability to}} act in fund management and corporate governance roles. However, the financial <b>reporting</b> <b>cycle</b> determined a private institutional and company meeting cycle and this created opportunities for private information collection and for governance influence by FIs. In addition, the perceived limitations of public governance mechanisms such as voting encouraged private governance approaches. As a result, the case financial institutions had the incentive and the means {{to improve the quality of}} their sources of corporate information and to obtain a competitive edge over other financial institutions and the market through their direct contact with companies. Despite the limitations of public information, the paper reveals how public disclosure in financial statements and the financial <b>reporting</b> <b>cycle</b> played a central role in corporate governance. Public sources of information were combined with private sources to create a financial institutional knowledge advantage. The institutions used this knowledge to diagnose problem areas in strategy, management quality, and the effectiveness of the board, and their impact on financial performance. The financial <b>reporting</b> <b>cycle</b> meant that the quasi insider financial institution had the access opportunity and the joint public/private insight to influence companies across a wide corporate governance agenda and in a range of corporate circumstances. The case institutions exploited these private access and knowledge advantages for investment purposes and for Cadbury style corporate governance purposes. Thus, the private governance process was critically dependent on the FI knowledge advantage, which in turn relied on both financial reports and private disclosure. This wide ranging governance behaviour by institutions corresponds to recommendations subsequently made by the Hampel report in 1998 concerning UK corporate governance. The paper ends by exploring how the private institutional and company meeting agenda can suggest new directions for financial reporting and public disclosure and how this can further improve public and private corporate governance...|$|E

Numerous earlier studies have analyzed the various patterns seen in the epidemiological data regarding menstrual cycle of adolescent girls. But there is dearth of data from Rohilkhand region of central UP state. Aims: To find out the abnormal menstrual patterns among adolescent girls in Bareilly city. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional study conducted by presenting a pre-designed and pre-tested self administered questionnaire, containing questions pertaining to menstrual practices and knowledge to 994 adolescent girls of urban schools in Bareilly city. Results: Mean age of menarche was 13. 11 ± 0. 95 years. 6. 07 % girls in the study <b>reported</b> <b>cycles</b> of abnormal lengths. This subset also had significantly higher prevalence of irregularity. Presence of irregular menses beyond 3 gynaecological years diminished the possibility of their regularization in near future. Among the girls with excessive dysmenorrhea, nearly 1 / 3 rd had associated menstrual disturbances also. Conclusion: Incidence of irregular menstrual cycle was 20. 75 % and it was significantly more in oligomennorheic cycles. Among normal menstrual cycles also, presence of IMC was significantly more in adolescents having mild oligomennorhea. 6. 07 % of girls <b>reported</b> abnormal <b>cycle</b> lengths. 77. 70 % reported dysmennorhea. Chances of menstrual cycles getting regularized after 5 years of menarchy are minimal.

The Public Finance Act provides a framework for pursuing these goals. It represents the foundation of accountability systems for the resources provided by taxpayers to the New Zealand Government, and which the Government administers on our behalf.
