40|$|International audienceMountain ranges are {{frequently}} subjected to mass wasting events triggered by storms or earthquakes and supply {{large volumes of}} sediment into river networks. Besides altering river dynamics, large sediment deliveries to alluvial fans are known to cause hydro-sedimentary hazards such as flooding and river avulsion. Here we explore how the sediment supply history affects hydro-sedimentary river and fan hazards, and how well can it be predicted given the uncertainties on boundary conditions. We use the 2 D morphodynamic model Eros with a new 2 D hydrodynamic model driven by a sequence of flood, a sediment entrainment/transport/deposition model and a bank erosion law. We first evaluate the model against a natural case: the 1999 Mount Adams rock avalanche and subsequent avulsion on the Poerua river fan (West Coast, New Zealand). By adjusting for the unknown sediment supply history, Eros predicts {{the evolution of the}} alluvial riverbed during the first post-landslide stages within 30 [*]cm. The model is subsequently used to infer how the sediment supply volume and rate control the fan aggradation patterns and associated hazards. Our results show that the total injected volume controls the overall levels of aggradation, but supply rates have a major control on the location of preferential deposition, avulsion and increased flooding <b>risk.</b> <b>Fan</b> re-incision following exhaustion of the landslide-derived sediment supply leads to sediment transfer and deposition downstream and poses similar, but delayed, hydro-sedimentary hazards. Our results demonstrate that 2 D morphodynamics models are able to capture the full range of hazards occurring in alluvial fans including river avulsion aggradation and floods. However, only ensemble simulations accounting for uncertainties in boundary conditions (e. g., discharge history, initial topography, grain size) as well as model realization (e. g., non-linearities in hydro-sedimentary processes) can be used to produce probabilistic hazards maps relevant for decision making...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Many {{communities}} in British Columbia are situated on alluvial fans fed by steep mountain creeks, which {{are subject to}} debris flow or flooding hazards. Development on most of these fans has taken place without planning for debris flow hazard. Several severe wildfires in 2003 were followed by incidents of debris flows and flooding, that affected inhabited private property and infrastructure. In the past, the increased hazard of flooding, erosion, and mass movement caused by wildfire has not been fully appreciated in British Columbia. A process is now underway to develop a systematic procedure for risk analysis following wildfires in British Columbia, and recently {{there have been some}} government initiatives to address the risk associated with natural hazards. Some semi-quantitative examples illustrating <b>risk</b> assessment on <b>fans</b> are presented. Some related aspects of planning for <b>risks</b> on alluvial <b>fans,</b> and the challenges of conducting risk analyses over large areas with low population density, are discussed...|$|R

(ii) In short term, the stock market in China has been impacted directly or indirectly by the international main stock markets, which varies under different regimes.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that individual animals show consistent differences in behavior. For example, individual threespined stickleback fish differ {{in how they}} react to predators and how aggressive they are during social interactions with conspecifics. A relatively unexplored but potentially important axis of variation is parental behavior. In sticklebacks, fathers provide all of the parental care that is necessary for offspring survival; therefore paternal care is directly tied to fitness. In this study, we assessed whether individual male sticklebacks differ consistently {{from each other in}} parental behavior. We recorded visits to nest, total time fanning, and activity levels of 11 individual males every day throughout one clutch, and then allowed the males to breed again. Half of the males were exposed to predation risk while parenting during the first clutch, and {{the other half of the}} males experienced predation risk during the second clutch. We detected dramatic temporal changes in parental behaviors over the course of the clutch: for example, total time fanning increased six-fold prior to eggs hatching, then decreased to approximately zero. Despite these temporal changes, males retained their individually-distinctive parenting styles within a clutch that could not be explained by differences in body size or egg mass. Moreover, individual differences in parenting were maintained when males reproduced for a second time. Males that were exposed to simulated predation <b>risk</b> briefly decreased <b>fanning</b> and increased activity levels.

40|$|Introduction: Fan {{violence}} is a frequent occurrence in Swiss football (Bundesamt für Polizei, 2015) leading to high costs for prevention and control (Mensch & Maurer, 2014). Various theories put forward an explanation of fan violence, such as the Elaborated Social Identity Model (Drury & Reicher, 2000) and the Aggravation Mitigation Model (Hylander & Guvå, 2010). Important observations from these theories are the multi-dimensional understanding of fan violence and the Dynamics occurring in the fan group. Nevertheless, none of them deal with critical incidents (CIs) which involve a tense atmosphere combined with a higher <b>risk</b> of <b>fan</b> violence. Schumacher Dimech, Brechbühl and Seiler (2015) tackled this gap in research and explored CIs where 43 defining criteria were identified and compiled in an integrated model of CIs. The defining criteria were categorised in four higher-order themes “antecedents” (e. g. a documented history of fan rivalry), “triggers” (e. g. the arrest of a fan), “reactions” (e. g. fans masking themselves) and “consequences” (e. g. fans avoiding communication with fan social workers). Methods: An inventory based on this model is being developed including these 43 criteria. In an exploratory phase, this inventory was presented as an online questionnaire and was completed by 143 individuals. Three main questions are examined: Firstly, the individual items are tested using descriptive analyses. An item analysis is conducted to test reliability, item difficulty and discriminatory power. Secondly, the model’s four higher-order themes are tested using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Thirdly, differences between sub -groups are explored, such as gender and age-related differences. Results: Respondents rated the items’ importance as high and the quota of incomplete responses was not systematic. Two items {{were removed from the}} inventory because of low mean or a high rate of “don’t know”-responses. EFA produced a six-factor solution grouping items into match-related factors, repressive measures, fans’ delinquent behaviour, intra-group behaviour, communication and control and inter-group factors. The item “fans consume alcohol” could not be ordered into any category but was retained since literature accentuates this factor’s influence on fan violence. Analyses examining possible differences between groups are underway. Discussion: Results exploring the adequacy of this inventory assessing defining criteria of CIs in football are promising and thus further evaluative investigation is recommended. This inventory can be used in two ways: as a standardised instrument of assessment for experts evaluating specific CIs and as an instrument for exploring differences in perception and assessment of a CI e. g. gender and age differences, differences between interest groups and stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Aim of the Thesis: To {{investigate}} {{the practice of}} using a CRM strategy in football clubs by comparing earlier successful and unsuccessful CRM implementations by football clubs and study fan relationship theories in a large Swedish football club, thereby presenting guidelines on how to further develop a CRM strategy in a Swedish football club.   Methodology: A quantitative approach and a qualitative approach have been used, first collecting empirical data on supporter views through a questionnaire further strengthened by gathering empirical data through an interview. The quantitative data has been presented with descriptive statistics and the qualitative data has been analyzed using a realist approach.   Theoretical Perspectives: A literature review has been conducted and resulted in a theoretical framework illustrating the concepts of benefits and <b>risks</b> with CRM, <b>fan</b> relationship marketing, CRM implementation process, CRM systems in football clubs, and supporter loyalty. A research model, “FRM implementation process” has been developed from the theoretical findings.     Empirical Data: The quantitative empirical data has been collected by distributing a questionnaire to supporters of AIK Fotboll. The qualitative empirical data has been collected through interviews {{with the head of}} sales and marketing within AIK Fotboll AB.   Conclusion: A CRM strategy can benefit Swedish football clubs in areas such as to better capture customer data, better communication between the club and its supporters and provide customized offers as long as the supporters are informed about the changes in strategy. In order for Swedish football clubs to successfully implement a CRM strategy they need to ensure adequate financing and management commitment since an unsuccessful implementation can be devastating to a Swedish football club’s finances...|$|R
40|$|Alluvial {{fans are}} depositional systems that develop {{because of a}} {{disparity}} between the upstream and downstream sediment transport capacity of a system, usually {{at the base of}} mountain fronts as rivers emerge from the constrained mountain area onto the plain. They are dynamic landforms that are prone to abrupt changes on a geomorphological (decades to centuries) time scale, while also being long-term deposition features that preserve sedimentary strata and are sensitive indictors of environmental change. The complexity of interactions between catchment characteristics, climate, tectonics, internal system feedbacks, and environmental processes on field alluvial fans means {{that it is difficult to}} isolate individual variables in a field setting; therefore, the controlled conditions afforded by experimental models has provided a novel technique to overcome some of these complexities. The use of experimental models of alluvial fans has a long history and these have been implemented over a range of different research areas utilising various experimental designs. Using this technique, important advances have been made in determining the primary factors influencing fan slope, understanding of avulsion dynamics, identifying autogenic processes driving change on fan systems independent of any change in external conditions, and the mechanics of flow and flood <b>risk</b> on alluvial <b>fans,</b> to name a few. However, experiments cannot be carried out in isolation. Thus, combining the findings from experimental alluvial fans with field research and numerical modelling is important and, likewise, using these techniques to inform experimental design. If this can be achieved, there is potential for future experimental developments to explore key alluvial fan issues such as stratigraphic preservation potential and simulating extra terrestrial fan systems...|$|R
