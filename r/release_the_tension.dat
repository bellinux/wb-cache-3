50|$|Because of {{the crime}} he is convicted for, he is unpopular among the other prisoners. To <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> his {{presence}} builds up in the correctional facility, Frankie is put on gardening duty in the warden living quarters.|$|E
50|$|Progressive muscle {{relaxation}} helps relax your muscles by tensing {{certain parts of}} the body (such as the neck), and then <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> in order to feel the muscles relaxing. This technique helps for people with anxiety because they are always tense throughout the day.|$|R
50|$|The roper {{returns to}} his horse, mounts, and moves <b>the</b> horse forward, <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> on <b>the</b> rope. An {{official}} will then time six seconds. If the steer is still tied {{at the end of}} the six seconds, an official time for the event is awarded.|$|R
500|$|Allmusic says [...] "the music {{takes the}} concept of a power ballad to epic heights: the verses build from somber {{softness}} to piercing heights of drama before giving way to a chorus that <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> with a meditative melodic figure that underlines the hypnotically-repeated title in a soothing fashion." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{ligament}} {{causes the}} wrist to deform even more. The {{purpose of this}} release is to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> and leave the wrist straight in further growth. In both physiolysis and dome osteonomy {{there should be a}} clear view of the abnormal.|$|E
50|$|Day {{continues}} to play bass in many genres of music and has recently played on The Sons recent <b>release</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tension</b> Of Dream Clouds which was released May 2015. He also plays double bass alongside drummer Spike T Smith, also an ex-Morrissey band member in Reza Uhdins band Black Volition.|$|E
50|$|Take {{the ends}} of the loop at both sides with the fingers, rotate the disk a bit, and draw the rope taut, fast, and <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> a bit. The disk will spin in one direction, reach its maximum, and then, helped by another yank, start {{spinning}} in the opposite direction.|$|E
50|$|Eventually Di Xin, fearing King Wen's growing power, imprisoned him. Although Wen {{was later}} <b>released,</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> between Shang and Zhou grew. Wen {{prepared}} his army, and conquered a few smaller states which were loyal to Shang, slowly weakening Shang's allies. However, King Wen died in 1050 before Zhou's actual offensive against Shang.|$|R
50|$|Leisure is {{intrinsically}} sought after by all {{as a way}} to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tensions</b> and stresses of work-life. It is often used to indulge in play - as is witnessed by how constantly obsessed nowadays people are with surfing the Internet, movies and games through their smartphones. There is no doubt that these are enjoyable activities.|$|R
50|$|Many {{purpose-built}} booby-trap firing devices exist such as {{the highly}} versatile M142 universal firing device (identical to the British L5A1 or Australian F1A1), or Yugoslavian UMNOP-1 which allow {{a variety of different}} ways of triggering explosives e.g. via trip wire (either pulling it or <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> on it), direct pressure on an object (e.g. standing on it), or pressure release (lift/shift something) etc.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tracks on}} Mwandishi are [...] "Ostinato," [...] the time {{signature}} {{of which is}} 15/8, [...] "You'll Know When You Get There", and [...] "Wandering Spirit Song". [...] "Wandering Spirit Song" [...] features Hancock's extensive use of tension and release, whereby he builds the tension of the song by {{increasing the amount of}} musical voices and increasing crescendos, only to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> with long held out chords on his synthesizer.|$|E
50|$|Carol Clover {{states that}} the monster in horror films {{possesses}} emasculated rage that portrays the male idea of the monstrous female identity. Wester {{states that the}} hero and the monster have blurred lines making their characteristics very similar. Both the hero and the monster are dependent on the female body whilst taking part of the patriarchal world and degrading women. The monsters in horror films try to hide their sexual frustration by masking their identity and human self. The mask allows the monster to kill and <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> from his sexual repression.|$|E
50|$|Heat therapy can be {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of headaches and migraines. Many people who suffer from chronic headaches also suffer from tight muscles in their neck and upper back. The application of constant heat to the back/upper back area can help to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> associated with headache pain. In order to achieve heat therapy for headaches, many use microwaveable pads which can often overheat, potentially leading to injury, and lose their heat after a few minutes. Some new products use heated water, running through pads, to maintain a constant temperature, allowing headache sufferers to use hands-free heat therapy in the treatment of their headache pain.|$|E
2500|$|This was due also to an {{intentional}} mistake {{made by the}} newly elected Pope during this speech, given in Italian language, a mistake that won immediately the applause of <b>the</b> crowd, <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> of <b>the</b> event. John Paul II said (in Italian): [...] "...se mi sbaglio mi corigerete!" [...] (something like: [...] "if I make a mistake, you will corict me!" [...] The correct form would be: [...] "mi correggerete.").|$|R
50|$|A buzzer (buzz, bullroarer, button-on-a-string), is {{an ancient}} {{mechanical}} device used for ceremonial purposes and as a toy. It is constructed by centering an object at the midpoint of a cord or thong and winding the cord while holding the ends stationary. The object is whirled by alternately pulling and <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> on <b>the</b> cord. The whirling object makes a buzzing or humming sound, giving the device its common name.|$|R
50|$|Ratchet {{fasteners}} are {{the most}} complex of the three fasteners to thread, but offer advantages in taking up the slack in <b>the</b> webbing and <b>tensioning</b> <b>the</b> assembly. Once the webbing is threaded through the fastener, the ratcheting mechanism is employed to take up <b>the</b> slack and <b>tension</b> <b>the</b> assembly to the necessary level. The ratcheting mechanism functions similarly to a socket wrench; you open and close the fastener repeatedly to pull the webbing through <b>the</b> fastener. <b>Releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> is {{a simple matter of}} depressing <b>the</b> <b>release</b> lever and pulling the webbing back through the fastener.|$|R
50|$|Drops may be hung {{by various}} means. Often made of muslin {{which has been}} sized and painted, the top may be pressed between two pieces of lumber (a batten) and clamped to a pipe, with a pipe or chain through a hem pocket at the bottom giving it weight to prevent flapping. Some may be grommeted along the top and tied to the pipe with {{tie-line}} (usually drapery cord nowadays). A time-honored method of hanging a drop is the roll-drop, in which {{the bottom of the}} drop is attached to a round batten. The drop is rolled onto it from the back, and is deployed by rope rigged through blocks (pulleys) to be pulled from offstage to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> holding the batten up, thus unrolling it slowly until completely unfurled.|$|E
50|$|A 16-year-old {{second year}} {{high school student}} from Nagaoka in Niigata Prefecture. She joins the G-Crew in the second season and becomes Hajime's new partner. She has an {{impulsive}} personality and slips into her home city's dialect when angry. Her dream {{is to become a}} pyrotechnician like her great-grandfather. She hates conflict, {{and as a result of}} meeting Gelsadra, who shares her ideals, she becomes his best friend and supporter, helping him become and even after he becomes prime minister. However, realizing how her influence caused Gelsadra to produce the Kuu-samas which are doing more harm than good, she seeks advice from her great-grandfather, who points out her greatest flaw was always taking in too much of atmosphere that she does not breathe properly to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> and think things through. This flaw was also the cause her being unable to transform into a Gatchaman at will, only subconsciously transforming when she gets angry. After clearing the issue up, she finally manages to properly transform to aid the other Gatchaman in defeating the Kuu-samas.|$|E
5000|$|By mid 1932 the New Guard {{was largely}} a spent force, though it drifted into the mid 1930s. It contested the state 1935 {{election}} (under {{the name of the}} Centre Party) and even enjoyed an after life as a bogey in the early 1970s. The rapid fall away of New Guard membership with Lang’s dismissal does seem indirect evidence of a lack of support for a fascist agenda. Yet {{there is no way of}} knowing what events might have been sparked if a coup had been attempted in so tense a context. Fortunately, it was not. Characteristically, the Old Guard waited, preferring first a heavy-handed attempt to influence Governor Game to dismiss the Lang Government. Eventually, after cautious and open consideration, Game’s timely intervention did <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension.</b> Although his polarising style had been a major cause of the crisis, Lang also contributed to the resolution. He apparently considered pre-emptive action to prevent his dismissal, but refrained. [...] Nor did he have any desire for armed struggle in the streets. Instead he fought on through traditional parliamentary methods. Perhaps he believed he would at least keep control within NSW Labor, to return triumphant as he had after defeat in 1927.|$|E
30|$|Two {{adjacent}} units triangular prism mast {{are closed}} {{to each other}} by locating pins and fastened to a work holder by a rope when it is folded. At this time, the longitudinal links are stowed into the prism frames and tension ropes are located to grooves. After <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> ropes, <b>the</b> triangular prism mast is deploying by the driving of the TSH hinges. Spherical wheels support the mast to reduce the influence of gravity.|$|R
5000|$|Interludes of the divertimento kind can {{be found}} in Leoš Janáček's last, sombre opera From the House of <b>the</b> Dead (1928): <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> after Skuratov's disheartening tale at the centre of the second act, two an [...] "opera" [...] and a [...] "pantomime" [...] within the larger opera are {{executed}} consecutively by a cast of prisoners, both presentations farcical variations on the Don Juan theme, and mirroring the religious ceremony divertimento before the Skuratov tale.|$|R
2500|$|Anand {{played the}} Sicilian Defence, but with 3.Bb5+ Carlsen avoided the sharpest main lines. Anand's 28...Qg5 was a mistake, {{allowing}} Carlsen to play 29.e5 with strong pressure on Black's d6-pawn. Maintaining <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> with 30.Nc3, 30.Ng3, or 30.b4 {{should have given}} White a winning game, but Carlsen erred with 30.exd6, <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> and allowing Anand to recoup the pawn soon after. The players traded down to a knight endgame where White had some advantage, and Carlsen may have missed a win by playing 43.Nd6 instead of 43.Nd2. The game ended in a draw due to insufficient mating material.|$|R
5000|$|The Hindu {{called the}} film [...] "a {{surprisingly}} well-made ‘horror-comedy’ that succeeds in continuously exploiting our irrational {{fear of the}} unknown even while nudging us to laugh at it...this is a fun summer film and should work regardless of whether one believes in the supernatural or not". Sify wrote, [...] "Yaamirukka Bayamey is something different within the commercial format and provides potent dose of laughs to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> built up by the scares". Indiaglitz.com wrote, [...] "The film, no doubt, is a compelling entertainer...with Yaamirukka Bayamey, debutante Deekay has secured a place for himself in the competitive industry". The Times of India gave it 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, [...] "The horror genre's mandatory elements are all here...but Deekay nicely subverts some of these cliches...Also, he doesn't try to spoof the genre's tropes to elicit laughs but chooses to bring out the humour in other ways. It is this confidence that makes the film work". Rediff gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, [...] "A clever script, good all round performances along with excellent support from the technical team make Deekay’s Yaamirukka Bayamey definitely worth a watch". Deccan Chronicle wrote, [...] "Some cheap thrills, enough screams, a whole lot of clichés with some laughs thrown in for good measure. With all the right elements in place, Yaamirukka Bayamey delivers what is expected of it".|$|E
5000|$|Elred Kumar then {{produced}} Yaamirukka Bayamey (2014), {{a horror}} comedy directed by newcomer Deekay, with an ensemble cast featuring Kreshna, Karunakaran, Rupa Manjari, Oviya and Anaswara Kumar. The film opened to positive reviews {{and became a}} commercial success, prompting remakes in several other languages. The Hindu called the film [...] "a surprisingly well-made ‘horror-comedy’ that succeeds in continuously exploiting our irrational {{fear of the unknown}} even while nudging us to laugh at it...this is a fun summer film and should work regardless of whether one believes in the supernatural or not". Likewise Sify wrote, [...] "Yaamirukka Bayamey is something different within the commercial format and provides potent dose of laughs to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> built up by the scares", and praised Elred's introduction of director Deekay. However, Elred Kumar's next film, Yaan (2014) starring Jiiva and Thulasi Nair, which marked the debut of cinematographer Ravi K. Chandran as a director, became a large commercial failure at the box office. The film, which was made on a lavish budget over a period of two years, was heavily criticised upon release. Baradwaj Rangan from The Hindu wrote, [...] "Yaan, is a major disappointment", while The Times Of India gave 2 out of 5 for the film and wrote, [...] "despite all the colours on screen, this is such a dull, flavourless film, let down by the writing, which is preposterous and uninspiring". After release, Elred Kumar heavily criticised Chandran and threatened to file legal action after it was reported that the film was plagiarised from Midnight Express (1978).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{theoretically}} clean channel B+→τ+ν shows a {{close to}} 3 σ {{discrepancy between the}} Standard Model prediction and the data. This in turn puts a strong constraint on the parameter space of a two-Higgs doublet model, including R-parity conserving supersymmetry. The constraint {{is so strong that}} it almost smells of fine-tuning. We show how the parameter space opens up with the introduction of suitable R-parity violating interactions, and <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> between data and theory...|$|E
5000|$|Theridiosoma gemmosum {{constructs}} a small orb web. The radii do not run {{directly to}} a central hub as with other orb webs, but are first joined into groups {{of two or three}} before combining to meet in the middle. A single thread runs from the centre to a nearby support, and is held by the spider. While the spider is holding this thread <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> pulls <b>the</b> web into a conical shape, described as [...] "like an umbrella turned inside out". When a prey item hits the web, <b>the</b> spider <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension,</b> causing <b>the</b> prey to become more enmeshed.|$|R
50|$|A devil's claw {{cannot be}} {{released}} {{while it is}} under <b>tension.</b> To <b>release</b> it, <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> must first be {{taken up by the}} windlass brake. Then the turnbuckle can be loosened and removed.|$|R
5000|$|They {{continued}} to record, <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tension</b> album in 1997, and the covers album Psychedelic Souls in 1998, which was recorded {{with members of}} Sublime and the Long Beach Dub Allstars, and brought the group a second Grammy nomination. The self-produced Equality followed in 2000, which featured reworkings of old songs recorded with Sly and Robbie, and saw the band receive their third Grammy nomination. They also contributed the song [...] "Renegade Survivor" [...] to the soundtrack of the animated motion picture Titan A.E. in 2000.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper will discussed {{the effectiveness of}} cricket on both nations as cricket is very popular sport in this region particularly in India and Pakistan. The history of Cricket series between India and Pakistan from 1987 to 2007 cricket world cup will also be analyzed that how cricket was effective during these periods to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> of both countries. This study conveyed {{that the power of}} Cricket proved a peaceful solution of every circumstance between India and Pakistan can be resolved as compare to the gun diplomacy...|$|E

40|$|The article {{primarily}} {{proposes a}} discussion on a clinical and psychopathological level concerning the bond between the child victim and the sexual attacker. We wonder about the influence which the adult of pedophilic structure establishes on his victim like the becoming of the latter. We will note that the repercussions in the deferred action of the traumatism plural and are differed in time. It is starting from a simple and paradigmatic clinical situation {{at the same time}} that we will <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> fields of our reflexion. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|People {{socially}} maladjusted often drink alcohol-containing {{drinks in}} a problematic manner (risky, harmful or addictive). Thus there is continuous need for appropriate selective and dedicated prevention. One of such procedures, {{developed for the}} military, is the „Korekta” program. It is a therapeutic treatment here {{referred to as a}} „short preventive intervention within a group”, and its structure enables to circumvent the typical obstacles encountered during preventive work, such as the effects of cognitive dissonance and the resulting resistance from the ones being treated. The specific structure of the program is the reason why the participants have got a limited possibility to use unconstructive strategies aiming at <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> (resulting from <b>the</b> cognitive dissonance) caused by the confrontation between their lifestyle and their knowledge of potential losses caused by drinking alcohol. It brings them closer to changing their lifestyle (contemplation phase according to Prochaski model) as a result of using constructive strategies of <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> caused by <b>the</b> cognitive dissonance. Thanks to such solutions the program is highly accepted by the participants, what is shown in formative evaluation scores and what is a sort of a paradox of prevention. It is recommended to apply this tool systematically in the resocialization system...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of syndiotactic propylene-butene copolymers (sPPBu), prepared with a metallocene catalyst, {{have been studied}} in {{the whole range of}} comonomer composition. Meltcrystallized unoriented films and oriented fibers of sPPBu copolymers show good elastic properties even though the samples present non-negligible level of crystallinity at any comonomer composition. These materials behave as thermoplastic elastomers with remarkable rigidity and mechanical strength that can be tuned by changing the comonomer composition. In samples with low butene concentration the elastic properties are associated with the reversible transformation between the trans-planar form III of syndiotactic polypropylene, obtained by stretching, and the helical form II, formed by <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension.</b> <b>The</b> occurrence of reversible phase transitions assists the elasticity of these materials through a non-negligible free energy contribution that is added to the conventional entropic contribution...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the preliminary {{development of a}} high force thermal latch (HFTL). The HFTL has one moving part which is restrained in the latched position by a low melting temperature or fusible metal alloy. When heated the fusible alloy flows to a receiving chamber {{and in so doing}} at first <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> load in <b>the</b> latch bolt and later <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> bolt itself. The HFTL can be used in place of pyrotechnically activated spacecraft release devices in those instances where the elimination of both pyrotechnic shock-loading and rapid strain-energy release take precedence over <b>the</b> near instantaneous <b>release</b> offered by ordnance initiated devices...|$|R
