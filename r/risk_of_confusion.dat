Although the mushrooms are considered edible, they are generally not recommended for consumption because of the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> with other poisonous red-pored, blue-bruising boletes. E.frostii may be distinguished from other superficially similar red-capped boletes by differences in distribution, associated tree species, bluing reaction, or morphology.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMother–pup vocal {{recognition}} {{abilities in}} pinnipeds reflect maternal reproductive strategies. In otariids, mother–pup pairs are frequently separated during lactation, pups are highly mobile {{at an early}} stage, and the high densities of colonies increase the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> between individuals. Accordingly, vocal recognition between mothers and pups is well developed in this group. In contrast, among phocids, the young are less mobile and mothers normally stay with their pups throughout lactation. Hence, the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> between individuals are relatively low and mother–young vocal recognition abilities are less developed in this family. Harbour seals, Phoca vitulina, are unique among phocids as females forage during lactation and pups are highly mobile throughout the 21 – 42 -day nursing period. We performed playback experiments on 18 breeding female harbour seals to assess their abilities to recognize the calls of their pup and to evaluate the effect of maternal protectiveness and pup vocal stereotypy on the recognition process. In addition, we performed propagation tests to assess pup call propagation efficiency in the environment. As early as 3 days after birth, females were more responsive to calls of their own pup than to calls of nonfilial pups. Female responses also varied depending on their protective behaviour displayed towards their pup. Vocal discrimination abilities were positively correlated {{with the level of}} individuality conveyed in pup calls. Considerable differences in the propagation efficiency of pup calls were measured among sites used for mother–pup reunions. This study provides experimental evidence that wild harbour seal females recognize the calls of their pup among others, and that they memorize previous versions of their pup's calls, taking into account age- and size-related effects on vocalizations. Propagation tests further suggest that some mother–pup reunion sites are better suited for vocal recognition than others...|$|R
