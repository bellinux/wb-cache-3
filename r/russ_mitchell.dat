25|$|Schieffer led the CBS Evening News {{to become}} the #2 evening news broadcast, ahead of ABC's World News Tonight.

When Charles Gibson was appointed as anchor of World News Tonight, ABC regained stability and momentum to regain the #2 spot. Bob Schieffer's final broadcast of the CBS Evening News occurred on August 31, 2006. <b>Russ</b> <b>Mitchell</b> filled in for the following two nights (September 1 and 4), after which he was succeeded on September 5 by Katie Couric.|$|E
2500|$|From 2011 to 2014 the CBS Evening News was {{the only}} {{remaining}} network evening newscast that used separate anchors for its Saturday and Sunday editions (NBC Nightly News previously used separate anchors for both weekend broadcasts until John Seigenthaler was appointed anchor of both the Saturday and Sunday editions in 1999, while ABC's World News Tonight maintained separate anchors for its weekend editions until then Saturday anchor David Muir also assumed anchor duties on the program's Sunday edition in 2011). John Roberts did anchor both Saturday and Sunday editions of the CBS Evening News for several months in 1999. [...] More recently, <b>Russ</b> <b>Mitchell</b> served as the weekend anchor for the CBS Evening News until December 2011, when he announced his resignation from CBS News to take a lead anchor position with NBC affiliate WKYC-TV in Cleveland, Ohio.

2500|$|The Dodgers {{lost their}} sixth {{straight}} game when Chris Johnson hit a three-run home run off Ted Lilly {{in the sixth}} inning for a 3–2 victory for the Houston Astros, in the opener of a four-game series. The Dodgers snapped the losing streak the following night when Jay Gibbons hit a two-run homer in the 11th inning to give the Dodgers a 4–2 victory. The Dodgers won again the next day, 6–3, the winning runs scoring on a throwing error by Brandon Lyon. Carlos Monasterios made an emergency start in {{the final game of}} the series after [...] Vicente Padilla was unable to go because of a recurring injury. However, Monasterios was unable {{to get out of the}} second inning as the Dodgers fell behind early. Jay Gibbons hit a three-run homer in the fourth to help bring the team close, but they lost 7–4. The Dodgers managed only one hit in the opening game of a three-game series at San Francisco, but still beat the Giants 1–0 thanks to Clayton Kershaw's first career complete game shutout. The next night, Chad Billingsley almost matched Kershaw, allowing only a broken-bat RBI single in seven innings, but the team lost 2–1 as Matt Cain pitched seven scoreless innings and the Dodgers were unable to score until Andre Ethier's two-out home run in the ninth. In the finale, Ted Lilly gave up two homers in 3 innings as the Dodgers were blown out 10–2. The only positive for the Dodgers in the game was that September callup <b>Russ</b> <b>Mitchell</b> recorded his first career hit, a home run to left field off of Giants starter Jonathan Sánchez in the 5th inning.|$|E
