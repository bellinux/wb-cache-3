500|$|In Chekhov's lifetime, British and Irish critics {{generally}} did {{not find}} his work pleasing; E. J. Dillon thought [...] "the effect on the reader of Chekhov's tales was repulsion at the gallery of human waste represented by his fickle, spineless, drifting people" [...] and R. E. C. Long said [...] "Chekhov's characters were repugnant, and that Chekhov <b>reveled</b> <b>in</b> stripping <b>the</b> last rags of dignity from the human soul". After his death, Chekhov was reappraised. Constance Garnett's translations won him an English-language readership and the admiration of writers such as James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Katherine Mansfield, whose story [...] "The Child Who Was Tired" [...] is similar to Chekhov's [...] "Sleepy". The Russian critic D. S. Mirsky, who lived in England, explained Chekhov's popularity in that country by his [...] "unusually complete rejection of what we may call the heroic values." [...] In Russia itself, Chekhov's drama fell out of fashion after the revolution, but it was later incorporated into the Soviet canon. The character of Lopakhin, for example, was reinvented as a hero of the new order, rising from a modest background so as eventually to possess the gentry's estates.|$|R

According to Donlan, the story {{is as simple as}} it can get. McShea said that although it does not pick up until near the end, it [...] "becomes powerful and moving in unexpected ways, peaking in a thrilling conclusion that successfully touches on many different emotions and provides closure for this epic tale." [...] Juba, on the other hand, considered that the plot [...] "doesn't have any standout revelations or developments".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} the recurring villain Ricardio, played by George Takei, a character that Tom Kenny later called [...] "the valentine from Hell". Takei later previously {{played the role}} in the season one episode [...] "Ricardio the Heart Guy". Sugar felt that Bubblegum, in the episode, {{was the victim of}} sexual harassment by Ricardio, and that the only way for her to solve the problem was for her to turn the situation around and somehow over come Ricardio. In the episode, this was metaphorically depicted by having Bubblegum best him in combat. Sugar <b>reveled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fact that she got to draw Bubblegum ripping off Ricardio's leg and beating him with; she noted that she had been wanting to featuring such a scene in her art since she was in high school. The climactic scene with Ricardio was also supposed to have featured more body imagery. Ricardio was originally slated to have been seated on a giant hand-throne, and the hole in the Ice King's chest was to have been more graphic.|$|E
500|$|The {{series has}} also {{received}} criticism because {{of problems with}} puzzles, weapons, and technical issues. Chains of Olympus was criticized by G4, who stated that the game [...] "occasionally suffers from screen tearing and framerate drops", {{and that some of}} the puzzles [...] "are so maddeningly difficult to solve". The game was also criticized for its lack of variety in enemies, its continued use of puzzles that require players to move boxes, and its relatively short story. God of War III also received some criticism. GameFront's Phil Hornshaw said it had an overly cruel antagonist, and the game assumed that the players <b>reveled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> misery and violence as much as Kratos did. IGN complained about the game's weapons, and said [...] "that two of the three additional weapons that you'll earn are extremely similar to your blades. They have unique powers and slightly different moves, but by and large, they're more of the same." [...] Ghost of Sparta received criticism from Eurogamer, which said that the [...] "game's primary problem...is in its in-built focus" [...] and [...] that [...] "there is a sense that Ghost of Sparta is a step back for the series if you've played [...]" [...] Some reviewers stated that Ascensionss story was not as compelling as previous installments, with IGN stating that in comparison to Zeus and Ares, [...] "the Furies don’t quite cut it". The multiplayer received a mixed response. Although reviewers claimed gameplay translated well into the multiplayer, they were critical of the balance and depth of combat. Edge magazine approved of the multiplayer, stating it is an [...] "evolutionary step" [...] with [...] "some fine ideas ... that will form part of this genre's future template." ...|$|E

40|$|Objective. Relationship, vitality, and {{conscientiousness}} {{are three}} fundamental virtues {{that have been}} recently identified as important individual differences to health, well being, and positive development. This cross-sectional study attempted to explore {{the relationship between the}} three constructs and post-traumatic growth (PTG) in three directions, including indirect trauma samples without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), direct trauma samples without PTSD, and direct trauma samples with PTSD. Methods. A total of 340 community participants from Sichuan Province, Mainland China involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study, most of which experienced Wenchuan and Lushan Earthquake. Participants were required to complete the self-reported questionnaire packages at one time point for obtaining their scores on virtues (Chinese Virtues Questionnaire), PTSD (PTSD Checklist-Specific), and PTG (Post-traumatic Growth Inventory-Chinese). Results. Significant and positive correlations between the three virtues and PTG were identified (r =. 39 –. 56; p <. 01). Further regression analysis by stepwise method <b>reveled</b> that: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> indirect trauma samples, vitality explained 32 % variance of PTG. <b>In</b> reference to <b>the</b> direct trauma sample without PTSD, both relationship and conscientiousness explained 32 % variance of PTG, whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direct trauma sample with PTSD, only conscientiousness accounted for 31 % <b>the</b> variance <b>in</b> PTG.

GamesRadar gave the game a score of 4.5/5, praising improved multiplayer and some moments so brilliant {{that they can make}} some other levels seem dull by comparison. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku called the game [...] "a terrific Mario game... just not a very good Wii U game", praising the game itself, but lamenting that it doesn't do much to show off the Wii U's capabilities.

2500|$|Although Sheridan {{assumed that}} Jubal Early was {{effectively}} {{out of action}} and he considered withdrawing his army to rejoin Grant at Petersburg, Early received reinforcements and, on October 19 at Cedar Creek, launched a well-executed surprise attack while Sheridan was absent from his army, ten miles away at Winchester. Hearing the distant sounds of artillery, he rode aggressively to his command. He reached the battlefield about 10:30a.m. and began to rally his men. Fortunately for Sheridan, Early's men were too occupied to take notice; they were hungry and exhausted and fell out to pillage the Union camps. Sheridan's actions are generally credited with saving the day (although Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright, commanding Sheridan's VI Corps, had already rallied his men and stopped their retreat). Early had been dealt his most significant defeat, rendering his army almost incapable of future offensive action. Sheridan received a personal letter of thanks from Abraham Lincoln and a promotion to major general in the regular army as of November 8, 1864, making him the fourth ranking general in the Army, after Grant, Sherman, and Meade. Grant wrote to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton after he ordered a 100-gun salute to celebrate Sheridan's victory at Cedar Creek, [...] "Turning what bid fair to be a disaster into glorious victory stamps Sheridan, what I have always thought him, one of the ablest of generals." [...] A famous poem, Sheridan's Ride, was written by Thomas Buchanan Read to commemorate the general's return to the battle. Sheridan <b>reveled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fame that Read's poem brought him, renaming his horse Rienzi to [...] "Winchester," [...] based on the poem's refrain, [...] "Winchester, twenty miles away." [...] The poem was widely used in Republican campaign efforts and some have credited Abraham Lincoln's margin of victory to it. As for Lincoln himself, the President, pleased at Sheridan's performance as a commander, wrote to Sheridan and playfully confessed his reassessment of the relatively short officer, [...] "When this peculiar war began, I thought a cavalryman should be six feet four inches, but I have changed my mind. Five foot four will do in a pinch." ...|$|E
