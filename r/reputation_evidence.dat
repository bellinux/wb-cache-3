50|$|The most {{relevant}} {{sources of information}} considered by the trust and reputation models presented before, are direct experiences and witness information.

The aggregation of more trust and <b>reputation</b> <b>evidence</b> is useful in a computational model but it can increase its complexity making a general solution difficult. Several models are dependent on the characteristics of the environment and a possible solution could be the use of adaptive mechanisms that can modify how to combine different sources of information in a given environment.

40|$|Reputation is an {{intangible}} asset that directly affects {{the market value}} of the firm. Although <b>reputation</b> <b>evidences</b> belief that the firm is on a sustainable course, it is built on the trust established with all stakeholders through past proper behaviour. It proves more resilient than one might think at first but even menial misconducts, if repeated, can lead to a downfall. The demise of a few can engulf a whole industry when the transactions are based on trust in the fulfilment of future promises. This is why reputation has become an object of research for several branches of management sciences. The key drivers are still in need of refinement.

40|$|Delay/Disruption {{tolerant}} networks (DTNs) are self-organized wireless ad-hoc networks, where end-to-end connectivity can not {{be guaranteed}} and communications rely {{on the assumption that}} the nodes are willing to store-carry-and-forward bundles in an opportunistic way. However, this assumption would be easily violated due to the selfish nodes which are unwilling to consume precious wireless resources by serving as bundle relays. To apply conventional reputation based incentive schemes in DTNs is extraordinarily challenging due to the unique network characteristics. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose SUC-CESS, a secure user-centric and social-aware reputation based incentive scheme for DTNs. Different from conventional reputation schemes which rely on neighboring nodes to monitor the traffic and keep tracks of each other’s reputation, SUCCESS allows a node to manage its <b>reputation</b> <b>evidence</b> and demonstrate its reputation whenever necessary. Two concepts, self-check and community-check, are defined for reputation evaluation according to the candidate’s forwarding competency and the sufficiency of the evidence shown by the node itself, and for speeding up reputation establishment and forming consensus views towards targets in the same community, respectively. Extensive performance analysis and simulations are given to demonstrate the se...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that the American rules for impeaching witnesses developed against a cultural background that equated a woman 2 ̆ 7 s honor, and thus her credibility, with her sexual virtue. The idea that a woman 2 ̆ 7 s chastity informs her credibility did not originate in rape trials and the confusing interplay between questions of consent and sexual history. Rather, gendered notions of honor so permeated American legal culture that attorneys routinely attempted to impeach female witnesses by invoking their sexual histories in cases involving such diverse claims as title to land, assault, arson, and wrongful death. But while many courts initially accepted the notion that an unchaste woman might be a lying witness, most jurisdictions ultimately rejected unchastity impeachment as illogical or irrelevant. In the process, the gendered notion of honor may have influenced judicial preference for <b>reputation</b> <b>evidence</b> over evidence regarding specific acts {{as a form of}} impeachment. The unchaste/incredible equation remained viable in the law of rape as courts continued to insist that the victim 2 ̆ 7 s sexual history was relevant to credibility, consent, or both. Although legal reforms have narrowed the use of sexual history evidence in rape trials, the concept that a woman 2 ̆ 7 s sexual virtue signifies her credibility survives today in moral turpitude law and in the treatment of prostitution as a crime that bears on credibility...|$|E

40|$|In business, {{agents are}} exposed to both hidden {{information}} and hidden action. Occasionally, reputation for credibility is valuable in solving or mitigating the economic consequences of these problems. A ‘good’ firm can distinguish itself from a ‘bad’ firm by sending a signal about its quality to the market or by attracting scrutiny. In three related essays, I examine topics revolving around this strategy. The first essay builds {{on the notion that}} management makes a trade-off between the expected costs and benefits of selecting a large audit firm. Given the geography of the audit market, the costs of selecting a large audit firm (that is typically located further away than a small audit firm) are increasing in client-auditor distance. I study how geographical distance influences the auditor selection process and the economic benefits of auditor <b>reputation.</b> <b>Evidence</b> documented in this study is consistent with a differentiated market for audit services where management of private firms selects the type of auditor minimizing the sum of expected benefits and costs. The second essay examines systematic differences in audit quality across audit firm size. Previous studies examine the effect of audit firm size on audit quality with the client-firm as the unit of analysis. I show that drawing inferences at the audit firm level from client-firm level analysis can be inaccurate. The third essay examines the consequences of commitment to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) disclosure standards on former NASDAQ firms’ information environments. I find that former NASDAQ firms change the level of disclosure within a relatively short event window around the decision to list on the prestigious NYSE. ...|$|E
