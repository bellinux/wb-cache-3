25|$|Calls {{between two}} panel offices, or calls {{within a single}} office, used <b>revertive</b> <b>pulsing</b> for signaling. The {{originating}} office inserted a compensating resistance during pulsing so its loop relay encountered the same resistance for all trunks.|$|E
25|$|Later systems {{maintained}} {{compatibility with}} <b>revertive</b> <b>pulsing,</b> even as more advanced signaling methods were developed. The Number One Crossbar, {{which was the}} first successor to the Panel system also used this method of signaling exclusively, until later upgrades introduced newer signaling such as Multi-frequency signaling.|$|E
25|$|In <b>revertive</b> <b>pulsing,</b> the pulses {{were sent}} in the reverse {{direction}} to the sender, a complex and sophisticated piece of hardware. If a selector failed to advance, it stopped sending pulses to the sender. A timer in the sender detected the failure, returned a trouble tone to the caller, held the switch train out of service with a grounded sleeve lead so no other caller could use the faulty circuit. An automated alarm alerted maintenance staff.|$|E
50|$|Loop start, ground start, reverse {{battery and}} <b>revertive</b> <b>pulse</b> systems are all DC, thus out of band, {{and all are}} channel-associated, since the DC {{currents}} are on the talking wires.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Revertive</b> <b>Pulse</b> {{system as}} used in 1XB had a [...] "High Five" [...] feature by which the Incoming Brush {{parameter}} could be incremented by five. Thus, the new IB numbers 6 through 10 designated a second ten thousand telephone numbers, known as a [...] "B" [...] office. This allowed each 1XB incoming section to handle twenty thousand lines.|$|R
25|$|<b>Revertive</b> <b>pulsing</b> (RP) worked {{faster than}} {{standard}} dial pulses, {{but the main}} advantage was in problem detection. In earlier systems, when a worn pawl or other problem in a Strowger selector caused it to fail to advance, only the calling party could detect the error as no connection was achieved. The caller eventually lost patience and redialed the call. The same user or another might get connected to the faulty selector again. Therefore, one bad Strowger selector could block many calls until subscriber complaints alerted staff to the problem.|$|E
25|$|The Panel switch {{was named}} for its tall panels covered with 500 rows of terminals. Each panel had an {{electric}} motor to drive usually sixty selectors by electromagnetically controlled clutches. The selector was similar in effect to a stepping switch though it moved continuously over the contacts. Each selector had five brushes, each of which could select from 100 terminals arranged in groups. Pulses were sent {{in the opposite direction}} than in the preexisting Strowger switches, i.e. from the selector to the register which had received the dialed digits from the caller, a signaling method that became known as <b>revertive</b> <b>pulsing.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Revertive</b> <b>pulsing</b> is {{a method}} of {{signaling}} in which the terminating equipment sends pulses backwards to the originating equipment as it hunts for the appropriate terminal. This {{is in contrast to}} more modern forms of forward pulsing where the originating equipment will directly outpulse to the terminating side the information it needs to connect the call. In Panel offices, as the selectors were driven upwards by the motors, brushes attached to the vertical selector rods [...] wiped over commutators {{at the top of the}} frame. These commutators contained alternating segments which serve either as insulators or conductors. When the brush passed over a conductive segment, it was grounded, thereby generating a pulse which was sent back to the sender in the originating office for counting. When the sender counted the appropriate number of pulses, it cut the power to the solenoid in the terminating office, and caused the brush to stop at its current position.|$|E
5000|$|In special cases, calls {{through a}} tandem office also used PCI signaling. This {{originated}} with manual operator tandems, {{and was later}} carried on to machine-based tandems as well. For this special tandem class, all seven dialed digits {{were sent to the}} distant office. In the case of a manual tandem, operators had a special seven segment display which displayed the entire telephone number. In later mechanical tandems, PCI was used because it was a faster than <b>revertive</b> <b>pulse</b> signaling, and would thus allow for quicker call completion times.|$|R
50|$|At the {{terminating}} office, a Terminating Sender Link circuit connected a terminating sender to the trunk, {{in order}} to receive the phone number, typically using <b>Revertive</b> <b>Pulse</b> as in the panel switch to receive only the last four digits. Multi-frequency Terminating Senders were introduced in the 1950s as part of Direct Distance Dialing, and also used for incoming traffic from some local crossbar exchanges. The Terminating Sender activated an Incoming Marker, which then used a Number Group Circuit to find the line, marked an idle path, and operated the crossbar switches to use the links to connect the incoming trunk to the line.|$|R
50|$|A tandem {{version of}} the 1XB omitted the {{incoming}} section and Line Link Frames and replaced the junctor circuits with incoming trunks, leaving only the ability to connect those incoming trunks to outgoing trunks. In many cases the resulting Crossbar tandem switch (XBT) replaced a Panel Sender Tandem, because its multi-frequency senders were able to receive seven digits and some were modified to accept ten. Sometimes it replaced an Office Select Tandem as well, since its <b>Revertive</b> <b>Pulse</b> senders were able to accept Office Brush and Group parameters. In big cities, some XBT were strictly incoming Class 4 telephone switches, some outgoing, a few both-way, and some only for tandem traffic within the metropolitan area. Specialization was less marked in less dense areas. XBT served local telephone companies until the late 20th Century when they were replaced by 4ESS switches or other digital switches.|$|R

5000|$|The Rotary and Panel {{systems were}} very {{different}} systems, but both used the same newly developed component technology, such as Western Electric's latest relays, and {{the principles of the}} Lorimer system of <b>revertive</b> <b>pulsing</b> and preselection. [...] The Rotary switches were smaller than the Panel system, and served only 200 rather than 500 stations. The initial version was the model 7A. It was succeeded by 7A1 and 7A2 and a rural system had the designation 7D.|$|E
