25|$|Yield {{management}} {{spread to}} other travel and transportation companies in the early 1990s. Notable was implementation of yield management at National Car Rental. In 1993, General Motors was forced to take a $744 million charge against earnings related to its ownership of National Car Rental. In response, National's program expanded the definition of yield management to include capacity management, pricing and reservations control. As {{a result of this}} program, General Motors was able to sell National Car Rental for an estimated $1.2 billion. Yield management gave way to the more general practice of <b>revenue</b> <b>management.</b> Whereas <b>revenue</b> <b>management</b> involves predicting consumer behavior by segmenting markets, forecasting demand, and optimizing prices for several different types of products, yield management refers specifically to maximizing revenue through inventory control. Some notable <b>revenue</b> <b>management</b> implementations include the NBC which credits its system with $200 million in improved ad sales from 1996 to 2000, the target pricing initiative at UPS, and <b>revenue</b> <b>management</b> at Texas Children's Hospital. Since 2000, much of the dynamic pricing, promotions management and dynamic packaging that underlie ecommerce sites leverage <b>revenue</b> <b>management</b> techniques. In 2002 GMAC launched an early implementation of web based <b>revenue</b> <b>management</b> in the financial services industry.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been {{high-profile}} failures and faux pas. Amazon.com was criticized for irrational price changes that resulted from a <b>revenue</b> <b>management</b> software bug. The Coca-Cola Company's plans for a dynamic pricing vending machine were put on hold {{as a result of}} negative consumer reactions. <b>Revenue</b> <b>management</b> is also blamed for much of the financial difficulty currently experienced by legacy carriers. The reliance of the major carriers on high fares in captive markets arguably created the conditions for low cost carriers to thrive.|$|E
25|$|Route rationalising {{was one of}} {{the major}} {{contributors}} to the airline's return to profitability.MAS pared its domestic routes from 114 to 23, and also cancelled virtually all unprofitable international routes. Apart from that, Malaysia Airlines also rescheduled all of its flight timings and changed its operations model from point-to-point services to hub and spoke services. Additionally, the airline started Project Omega and Project Alpha to improve the company's network and <b>revenue</b> <b>management.</b> Emphasis has been placed on six areas: pricing, <b>revenue</b> <b>management,</b> network scheduling, opening storefronts, low season strategy and distribution management. MAS then pushed for new aircraft purchases, using its cash surplus of RM5.3 billion to eventually purchase new narrow-body aircraft and wide-body aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Medical billing {{is getting}} {{increasingly}} more complicated, especially as medical code guidelines {{are making the}} switch from ICD-9 to ICD-10. Proper <b>Revenue</b> Cycle <b>Management</b> ensures that billing errors are reduced so that reimbursements from the insurance companies are maximized. <b>Revenue</b> Cycle <b>Management</b> teams are responsible for maintaining compliance with coding regulations, such as the ICD-10 code update. Using the right coding for services rendered by a practice ensures that insurance claims can be processed and that the practitioner is compensated for all of their services rendered. A <b>revenue</b> cycle <b>management</b> team is able to handle this, rather than having the doctor take care of patients and learn new medical coding protocols.|$|R

40|$|<b>Revenue</b> cycle <b>management</b> — all {{clinical}} and administrative {{activities related to}} generating and collecting patient revenue — has gained in importance in today’s business environment, in which hospitals are confronted with stricter regulations and billing requirements, underpayments, and greater delays in payments. Despite the continued interest of practitioners, <b>revenue</b> cycle <b>management</b> has not received much attention in health care finance research. The three studies that comprise this dissertation seek to complement anecdotal evidence and fill some of the gaps in the literature by defining and exploring the financial benefits hospitals derive from effectively managing the revenue cycle. The first study describes current <b>revenue</b> cycle <b>management</b> practices and develops measures of their financial benefits in terms of increases in the amount and the speed of patient revenue collection. Using financial statement information for California hospitals for 2004 – 2007, correlation analysis shows that hospitals that collect their revenues faster tend to record higher revenues indicating {{that there is no}} trade-off but that these financial benefits of effective <b>revenue</b> cycle <b>management</b> often go hand in hand. The second study explores the determinants of <b>revenue</b> cycle <b>management</b> performance with a particular focus on hospitals’ payer mix. Using data from Medicare cost reports and financial statements for bond-issuing, not-for-profit hospitals for 2000 – 2007, fixed effects regression analysis finds that hospitals serving more Medicare patients collect somewhat more revenue while also collecting their revenue faster. Higher Medicaid payer mix, on the other hand, is associated with neither the amount nor the speed of revenue collection. Unlike frequently claimed by hospital managers, government payers therefore do not appear to undermine hospitals’ ability to generate and collect patient revenue. The third study analyzes the link between <b>revenue</b> cycle <b>management</b> and hospitals’ long-term financial performance. Fixed effects regression analysis of audited financial statement information for bond-issuing, not-for-profit hospitals for 2000 – 2007 finds that effective <b>revenue</b> cycle <b>management</b> has the potential to boost not-for-profit hospitals’ profitability and strengthen their ability to grow equity. This link is particularly strong for measures of operating performance indicating that the pathway through which <b>revenue</b> cycle <b>management</b> improves financial viability focuses on operations...|$|R
25|$|Resource-rich {{countries}} tend {{to collect}} more revenue {{as a share}} of GDP, but this is more volatile. Sub-Saharan African countries that are resource rich have performed better tax collecting than non-resource-rich countries, but revenues are more volatile from year to year. By strengthening <b>revenue</b> <b>management,</b> there are huge opportunities for investment for development and growth.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor for}} the losses was poor <b>revenue</b> <b>management.</b> MAS {{substantially}} lagged its peers on yield. Some of this gap was {{due to differences in}} traffic mix, with less business traffic to and from Malaysia than to and from Singapore, but much of it was due to weaknesses in pricing and <b>revenue</b> <b>management,</b> sales and distribution, brand presence in foreign markets, and alliance base. Morever, MAS had one of the lowest labour costs per available seat kilometres (ASK) at USD0.41, compared to other airlines such as Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines at USD0.59 and USD0.60 respectively. Despite low labour costs, however, the ratio of ASK revenue to this cost was, at 2.8, much lower than Singapore Airlines, where the ratio is 5.0, and slightly higher than Thai Airways There are other factors listed in the later-revealed Business Turnaround Plan of Malaysia Airlines, all leading to the net loss of RM1.3 billion in the year 2005.|$|E

30|$|Since {{the amount}} of losses due to {{depredation}} is not fixed and follows a Poisson distribution, and is characterized as the distribution of rare events, {{it is possible that}} the model underestimates losses from management without sheepdogs. This would outweigh revenues obtained by the other strategy. It might also overestimate losses, leading to revenue levels below the break-even point. We derived the probability, obtained by the Poisson distribution, that the <b>revenue</b> from <b>management</b> without sheepdogs which will exceed the <b>revenue</b> from <b>management</b> with sheepdogs is 2.04 [*]×[*] 10 − 6.

25|$|New {{regulations}} and {{a process of}} legislative reforms aim to improve the harmonization and stability of the mining sector in mineral-rich countries. New legislation for mining industry in African countries still {{appears to be an}} issue, but {{has the potential to be}} solved, when a consensus is reached on the best approach. By the beginning of the 21st century the booming and increasingly complex mining sector in mineral-rich countries was providing only slight benefits to local communities, especially in given the sustainability issues. Increasing debate and influence by NGOs and local communities called for a new approahes which would also include disadvantaged communities, and work towards sustainable development even after mine closure (including transparency and <b>revenue</b> <b>management).</b> By the early 2000s, community development issues and resettlements became mainstream concerns in World Bank mining projects. Mining-industry expansion after mineral prices increased in 2003 and also potential fiscal revenues in those countries created an omission in the other economic sectors in terms of finances and development. Furthermore, this highlighted regional and local demand for mining revenues and an inability of sub-national governments to effectively use the revenues. The Fraser Institute (a Canadian think tank) has highlighted the environmental protection laws in developing countries, as well as voluntary efforts by mining companies to improve their environmental impact.|$|E

2500|$|Yield {{management}} is a variable pricing strategy, based on understanding, anticipating and influencing consumer behavior {{in order to}} maximize revenue or profits from a fixed, time-limited resource (such as airline seats or hotel room reservations or advertising inventory). As a specific, inventory-focused branch of <b>revenue</b> <b>management,</b> yield management involves strategic control of inventory to sell the right product to the right customer at the right time for the right price. This process can result in price discrimination, in which customers consuming identical goods or services are charged different prices. Yield {{management is}} a large revenue generator for several major industries; Robert Crandall, former Chairman and CEO of American Airlines, gave yield management its name and has called it [...] "the single most important technical development in transportation management since we entered deregulation." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{important}} difference is service recovery. [...] When an error occurs in service delivery, the recovery must be delivered {{on the spot}} by the service provider. [...] If a waiter in a restaurant spills soup on the customer's lap, then the recovery could include a free meal and a promise of free dry cleaning. [...] Another difference is in planning capacity. [...] Since the product cannot be stored, the service facility must be managed to peak demand which requires more flexibility than manufacturing. Location of facilities must be near the customers and scale economics can be lacking. Scheduling must consider the customer can be waiting in line. [...] Queuing theory has been devised to assist in design of service facilities waiting lines. [...] <b>Revenue</b> <b>management</b> is important for service operations, since empty seats on an airplane are lost revenue when the plane departs and cannot be stored for future use.|$|E
