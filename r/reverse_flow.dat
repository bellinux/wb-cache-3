40|$|Hemodynamic forces play an {{important}} role in the non-uniform distribution of atherosclerotic lesions. Endothelial cells are exposed simultaneously to fluid wall shear stress (WSS) and solid circumferential stress (CS). Due to variations in impedance (global factors) and geometric complexities (local factors) in the arterial circulation a time lag arises between these two forces that can be characterized by the temporal phase angle between CS and WSS (stress phase angle-SPA). Asynchronous flows (SPA close to - 180 °) that are most prominent in coronary arteries have been associated with localization of atherosclerosis. <b>Reversing</b> oscillatory <b>flows</b> characterized by an oscillatory shear index (OSI) that is great than zero are also associated with atherosclerosis localization. In this study we examined the relationship between asynchronous <b>flows</b> and <b>reversing</b> <b>flows</b> in altering the expression of 37 genes relevant to atherosclerosis development. In the case of <b>reversing</b> oscillatory <b>flow,</b> we observed that the asynchronous condition upregulated 8 genes compared to synchronous hemodynamics, most of them proatherogenic. Upregulation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NFκB p 65 was confirmed by western blot, and nuclear translocation of NFκB p 65 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. A comparative study between non-reversing <b>flow</b> and <b>reversing</b> <b>flow</b> found that in the case of synchronous hemodynamics, <b>reversing</b> <b>flow</b> altered the expression of 11 genes, while in the case of asynchronous hemodynamics, <b>reversing</b> <b>flow</b> altered the expression of 17 genes. <b>Reversing</b> <b>flow</b> significantly upregulated protein expression of NFκB p 65 for both synchronous and asynchronous conditions. Nuclear translocation of NFκB p 65 was confirmed for synchronous and asynchronous conditions in the presence of flow reversal. These data suggest that asynchronous hemodynamics and <b>reversing</b> <b>flow</b> can elicit proatherogenic responses in endothelial cells compared to synchronous hemodynamics without shear stress reversal, indicating that SPA as well as reversal flow (OSI) are important parameters characterizing arterial susceptibility to disease...|$|R

Our discussion highlights the fact that service supply chains can be quite diverse in the type of exchanges of inputs and outputs that take place between customers and providers, showing that often there can be substantial flows of items to return. In particular, and differently from manufacturing contexts, we highlight that in service supply chains providers might need to handle bi-directional <b>reverse</b> <b>flows.</b> Research limitations/implications - The lack of research on reverse service supply chains is to a great extent a consequence of dominant paradigms which often identify the absence of physical product flows as a key distinguishing feature of service supply chains, and therefore lead to the misbelief that in services there is nothing to return. This special issue therefore aims to clarify this misunderstanding through the limited selection of eight papers that address various issues around reverse exchanges in service supply chains.

METHODS: A total of 145 singleton growth-restricted fetuses with abnormal umbilical artery pulsatility indexes were studied. Cesarean delivery was performed because of abnormal biophysical profile or nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern. RESULTS: There were 4 fetal and 50 neonatal deaths. Two growth-restricted groups were identified: Group A (n = 44) included fetuses in whom all measures became abnormal preceding an abnormal biophysical profile or nonreassuring nonstress test. Group B (n = 101) included fetuses in whom 1 or more measures were normal {{at the time of}} cesarean delivery. There was no statistically significant difference in perinatal morbidity and mortality between the 2 groups. Neonatal death was increased in fetuses with umbilical artery <b>reversed</b> <b>flow</b> (odds ratio 2. 34, 95 % confidence interval 1. 16 - 4. 73; P <. 05) and ductus venosus <b>reversed</b> <b>flow</b> (odds ratio 4. 18, 95 % confidence interval 2. 01 - 8. 69; P <. 05).
