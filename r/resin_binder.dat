The pigments were {{selected on the basis}} of a hypothesis relating the heat of formation of a compound to the compound's resistance to ultraviolet-radiation-induced degradation. Reflectance measurements were made in situ to determine degradatiorna tes due to ultraviolet radiation. The tested polydimethylsiloxane resins were not significantly affected by long exposures to ultraviolet radiation. All the pigments, which were dispersed in a polydimethylsiloxane resin, were degraded by ultraviolet radiation as determined by an increase of solar absorptance. For the materials evaluated in this study, no evidence was found to indicate that pigments with high heats of formation were resistant to ultraviolet degradation.

40|$|This {{program was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} concentration of the major gaseous decomposition products of foundry sand binds, and to relate the nature and amounts of the gases formed at the silica sand/metal interface to the surface integrity of the iron or steel castings produced.

The mold was of a gear design sensitive to casting defects.

50|$|Micaceous {{iron oxide}} (MIO) is another {{alternative}} to lead for protection of steel, giving more protection against water and light damage than most paints. When MIO pigments are ground into fine particles, most cleave into shiny layers, which reflect light, thus minimising UV degradation {{and protecting the}} <b>resin</b> <b>binder.</b> Most pigments used in paint tend to be spherical, but lamellar pigments, such as glass flake and MIO have overlapping plates, which impede the path of water molecules. For optimum performance MIO should have a high content of thin flake-like particles resembling mica. ISO 10601 sets two levels of MIO content. MIO is often derived from a form of hematite.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to study the casting characteristics of various Al-Li alloys, which include fluidity and strengths of the alloys and their interaction with cast molds. Materials investigated are Al-Li-Mg and Al-Li-Cu-Mg alloys with Li content of 2. 5 wt%. The results show that sand molds with <b>resin</b> <b>binders</b> are good for Al-Li casting. Ceramic coatings can further reduce the metal-mold interactions. However, the permeability is also reduced by coating. The fluidity of Li-bearing aluminum alloys is inferior to that of A 356. Compared with copper, magnesium gives a better combination of fluidity and strength to Al-Li alloys. Al-Li-Cu, together with Al-Li-Mg, are capable of providing {{a wide range of}} strength-ductility combination to casting designs.

50|$|Paint {{consists}} of three main components: pigments, <b>resins</b> or <b>binders,</b> and water or solvents. Pigments are finely grounded materials that give out colors or block out the surface beneath it. They may contain other materials such as UV stabilizer, and fillers which bring out the color pigments to the required level. <b>Resins</b> or <b>binders</b> are the glue of the paint to bind pigment and glass beads together to the road surface. The resins for the water-based paints are polyvinyl acetate latex, methyl methacrylate or acrylic resin. The resins for solvent-based paints are linseed or soya oils and alkyd resins. The pigments and resins are mixed with water for water-based paints and solvents for solvent-based paints {{so that they can}} be applied onto the road surface. Solvents that are use can be naphtha, toluene, methanol, methylene chloride, and acetone. Due to environmental concerns, some jurisdictions has some restriction on the solvent-based paints.|$|R
50|$|Engineered {{stone is}} less porous, more flexible, and harder than {{many types of}} natural stone. Less porous {{varieties}} are more resistant to mould and mildew than most natural stone types. Since it has a uniform internal structure, {{it does not have}} hidden cracks or flaws that may exist in natural stone. Its polyester resin binding agents allow some flexibility, preventing cracking under flexural pressure. But, the binding agents often continue to harden, leading to a loss of flexural strength over time. The polyester resins are not completely UV stable and engineered stone should not be used in outdoor applications. Continuous exposure to UV can cause discoloration of the stone, and breakdown of the <b>resin</b> <b>binder.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{system is}} mixed on site and cold applied, using a {{high-quality}} clear <b>resin</b> <b>binder</b> {{to coat the}} aggregate particles prior to laying. Unlike resin-bonded surfacing, where {{a thin layer of}} resin is applied to the surface and then the aggregate scattered on top (which can then become loose over time and is impermeable), resin and aggregates are thoroughly mixed together prior to laying, ensuring that the aggregate is completely coated and so providing a totally bound surface. As a result, a resin-bound surface is more durable and requires less maintenance - it needs to be swept or power washed at least twice a year, to avoid the buildup of detritus and prevent the growth of moss or algae.|$|E

40|$|Contemporarily designed, new polymer concrete-like {{composites}} {{are increasingly}} {{often used in}} construction, particularly where high chemical resistance of the material is important. However, their widespread use is limited, mainly due {{to the cost of}} <b>resin</b> <b>binders</b> used. This is a significant problem, especially in a situation where it is necessary to obtain elements of a substantial volume. One solution to this inconvenience is to develop lighter concrete. The article presents a lightweight resin mortar obtained by substitution of sand with expanded perlite. Thanks to its properties, this aggregate allows for the production of a material with a more porous structure, which is highlighted by the received SEM photos. The binder in the mortars was epoxy resin, hardened with triethylenetetramine. The results of the tests carried out allow us to conclude that despite the significant reduction of strength parameters of mortar, we can obtain a material with lower weight, good chemical resistance and low water absorption, and characterized by significant thermal insulation. This type of composites can be used, among others, as cores in sandwich panels...|$|R
