5|$|After the war, Theodore Synadenos {{was rewarded}} by being made {{governor}} of Constantinople, Apokaukos became {{head of the}} imperial secretariat, Kantakouzenos remained Andronikos III's principal advisor as megas domestikos, and Syrgiannes was named governor of Thessalonica. Around 1330, Synadenos was sent as governor to Mesembria, while in 1336, after Andronikos III and John Kantakouzenos annexed Epirus, he became its governor. In late 1338, however, a revolt broke out in Epirus in favour of Nikephoros II Orsini, the last descendant of the Epirote ruling dynasty. Synadenos was taken captive in the capital, Arta by the <b>rebels,</b> <b>and</b> remained a prisoner until 1340, when Andronikos III and Kantakouzenos campaigned against the <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> recovered the region. John Angelos, a relative of Kantakouzenos, was installed as the new governor, while Synadenos {{was moved to the}} governorship of Thessalonica.|$|E
5|$|For decades, {{rebels in}} Cuba had waged an {{intermittent}} campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule. By 1895, the conflict had expanded {{to a war}} for Cuban independence. As war engulfed the island, Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher. American public opinion favored the <b>rebels,</b> <b>and</b> McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies. However while public opinion called for war to liberate Cuba, McKinley favored a peaceful approach, hoping that through negotiation, Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence, {{or at least to}} allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the <b>rebels</b> (<b>and</b> their American supporters) would never settle for anything less.|$|E
5|$|In Jerusalem meanwhile, Rashad Bey and his {{garrison}} (numbering 1,500 men) were {{assaulted by}} rebel forces. Rashad Bey and 800 Egyptian soldiers were killed, while hundreds more were captured by <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> taken to Hebron. Ibrahim Pasha had since returned to Mount Zion and the rebels attempted to lay siege {{against him and}} his troops.|$|E

5|$|In the Revolt of 1173–74 by Henry II's sons {{against their}} father, the king gave de Broc custody of Haughley Castle. On 13 October 1173, Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, {{captured}} the castle for the <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> burned {{it to the}} ground.|$|E
5|$|In the {{earliest}} {{stage of the}} revolt, in the early summer, al-Hajj Muhammad's fighters primarily operated in the Wadi al-Sha'ir area between Nablus and the coastal plain. Most of their actions consisted of attacks against British Army and police patrols between Tulkarm and Nablus. On 21 June in the Battle of Anabta, al-Hajj Muhammad and his fasa'il ambushed a British Army force protecting a Jewish convoy passing near the village. Three British bomber planes were dispatched to aid the ambushed convoy. The ensuing battle lasted about seven hours and ended with the deaths of ~10 <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> 2 British soldiers. A further 21 <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> two British soldiers were wounded. The authorities consequently issued an arrest warrant for al-Hajj Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|The victory, {{achieved}} at relatively little cost, cleared the Lado Enclave of Mahdist <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> secured Rejaf as a Belgian base for future {{operations in the}} surrounding territories and along the Nile. Rejaf became the seat of government within the Lado Enclave, and remained thus when the British eventually reclaimed the territory in 1910.|$|E

5|$|When {{the talks}} between the <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> the papacy led to nothing and no foreign support arrived, the rebels were forced to capitulate to the Ottomans.

5|$|As the Golden Path secures Kyrat's {{southern}} provinces, Ajay is {{contacted by}} Willis Huntley (Alain Goulem), a CIA agent who offers intelligence for the <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> pages from his father's diary {{in exchange for}} killing Yuma's lieutenants. After Ajay kills several of them, Huntley admits they were in fact CIA assets, {{and that he was}} sent to clean up after the CIA as the agency did not see Pagan as a threat anymore. Huntley betrays Ajay to Pagan just as the Golden Path prepare to push into Northern Kyrat.|$|E
5|$|By 1927, all {{street and}} square names in Istanbul {{which were not}} of Turkish origin were changed.

During the heightened tension between Kurdish <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> the Turkish government, the focus of geographical name changing in the 1980s was on Kurdish villages, towns, rivers, etc.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the month, the Serb <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> the JNA {{controlled}} {{nearly all}} of the southern bank of the river, and the lines of control in the region largely stabilised. Before the ceasefire of 3 January 1992, which implemented the Vance plan, the Serb <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> the JNA made two more unsuccessful attempts to push back the Croatian forces in the region. These attacks comprised the autumn campaign undertaken by the JNA—in the area of Slana and Novi Farkašić on 17–18 October and in the area of Sunja on 2 November. In the same period, the ZNG launched an unsuccessful offensive codenamed Operation Whirlwind to recapture Glina on 11–13 December. The 120 Croats who remained in the area of Dubica faced persecution, culminating in the Baćin massacre of more than 50 Croats on 21 October, and the rounding up and expulsion of the remainder on 20 November.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 12th century Palmyra was ruled by Toghtekin, the Burid atabeg of Damascus, who {{appointed}} his nephew governor. Toghtekin's nephew {{was killed by}} <b>rebels,</b> <b>and</b> the atabeg retook the city in 1126. Palmyra was given to Toghtekin's grandson, Shihab-ud-din Mahmud, who was replaced by governor Yusuf ibn Firuz when Shihab-ud-din Mahmud returned to Damascus after his father Taj al-Muluk Buri succeeded Toghtekin. The Burids transformed the Temple of Bel into a citadel in 1132, fortifying the city, and transferring it to the Bin Qaraja family three years later in exchange for Homs.|$|E
5|$|Déby faces armed {{opposition}} from {{groups who are}} deeply divided by leadership clashes but united in their intention to overthrow him. These forces stormed the capital on 13 April 2006, but were ultimately repelled. Chad's greatest foreign influence is France, which maintains 1,000 soldiers in the country. Déby relies on the French to help repel the <b>rebels,</b> <b>and</b> France gives the Chadian army logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability. Nevertheless, Franco-Chadian relations were soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American Exxon company in 1999.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, São Paulo and Minas Geraes {{helped to}} put down the first of the Tenente revolts. Soldiers seized Fort Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro on 5 July, but no other men joined them. As a result, some men deserted the <b>rebels,</b> <b>and</b> by the next morning only 200 people {{remained}} in the fort. São Paulo bombarded the fort, firing five salvos and obtaining at least two hits; the fort surrendered half an hour later. The Brazilian Navy's official history reports that one of the hits opened a hole ten meters deep.|$|E
5|$|In 756, Emperor Xuanzong {{was forced}} to flee the capital and abdicate. Du Fu, who had been away from the city, took his family {{to a place of}} safety and {{attempted}} to join the court of the new emperor (Suzong), but he was captured by the <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> taken to Chang'an. In the autumn, his youngest son, Du Zongwu (Baby Bear), was born. Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted malaria.|$|E
5|$|In October 1899, he saw {{his first}} combat action when he led 300 Marines to take the town of Noveleta, from Filipino rebels known as Insurrectos.

By noon the Marines had dispersed the <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> taken the town. One Marine had been killed and ten were wounded. Another 50 Marines had been incapacitated by the humid tropical heat.|$|E

5|$|In defence of his nation, the Drapier {{turns around}} claims of treason and papal loyalty against Wood and his {{defenders}} (especially Walpole), calling them as treasonous as the Jacobite <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> the Parliamentary rebels.

5|$|In {{response}} to the revolt, the Aćimović administration encouraged 545 or 546 prominent and influential Serbs to sign the Appeal to the Serbian Nation, {{which was published in}} the German-authorised Belgrade daily newspaper Novo vreme on 13 and 14 August. Those that signed included three Serbian Orthodox bishops, four archpriests, and at least 81 professors from the University of Belgrade, although according to the historian Stevan K. Pavlowitch, many of the signatories were placed under pressure to sign, and Professor Jozo Tomasevich notes that many of those who signed it were known for their leftist views. The appeal called upon the Serbian population to help the authorities in every way in their struggle against the communist <b>rebels,</b> <b>and</b> called for loyalty to the Nazis, condemning the Partisan-led resistance as unpatriotic. The Serbian Bar Association unanimously supported the Appeal. The Aćimović administration also appealed for rebels {{to return to their homes}} and announced bounties for the killing of <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> their leaders. Aćimović also gave orders that the wives of communists and their sons older than 16 years of age be arrested and held, and the Germans burned their houses and imposed curfews.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} fighting between the <b>rebels</b> <b>and</b> the Byzantines continued. Although the Bulgarian forces were cut in two following the Byzantine landing at Varna, heavy clashes {{erupted in the}} eastern Balkan mountains with new vigour, especially around the Kotel Pass and the Varbitsa Pass. The Bulgarian positions there were surrounded both {{from the north and}} the south. The Byzantines had to besiege and take the fortresses one by one which cost time and casualties. Many strongholds remained unconquered and permanently engaged large Byzantine forces.|$|E
