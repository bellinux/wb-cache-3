40|$|Throughout history, {{farmers have}} engaged in the {{practice}} of saving seed from each harvest to use in planting the following year 2 ̆ 7 s crap. This practice, however; has been a significant concern for those developing new varieties of seed. The 2 ̆ 2 terminator 2 ̆ 2 technology was developed to prevent the saving and replanting of genetically engineered seeds by blocking the germination of these seeds after one growing season. The terminator technology, however; caused worldwide controversy over the scope of intellectual property protections for genetically engineered seeds used in agriculture because farmers believed that seeds incorporating the terminator technology would interfere with the traditional and historical <b>right</b> <b>to</b> save and <b>replant</b> seed. This Note argues that use of the terminator technology in genetically engineered seeds would be an effective way to enforce existing intellectual property protections and that public property doctrines would fail to recognize a common law <b>right</b> <b>to</b> save and <b>replant</b> seed...|$|R
5000|$|Canadian {{law does}} not mention any such [...] "farmer's rights"; {{the court held that}} the farmer's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> save and <b>replant</b> seeds is simply the right of a {{property}} owner to use his or her property as he or she wishes, and hence the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> use the seeds is subject to the same legal restrictions on use rights that apply in any case of ownership of property, including restrictions arising from patents in particular. The court wrote: [...] "Thus a farmer whose field contains seed or plants originating from seed spilled into them, or blown as seed, in swaths from a neighbour's land or even growing from germination by pollen carried into his field from elsewhere by insects, birds, or by the wind, may own the seed or plants on his land even if he did not set about to plant them. He does not, however, own the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the use of the patented gene, or of the seed or plant containing the patented gene or cell." ...|$|R
40|$|Hail {{is one of}} {{the many}} hazards that can damage a growing crop. Early in the growing season a {{producer}} has the option <b>to</b> <b>replant</b> a field seriously damaged by hail. The question is, how do you decide if it is worthwhile <b>to</b> <b>replant,</b> and what information do you need to make an informed decision? Factors to consider when deciding <b>to</b> <b>replant</b> are the expected yield reduction due to hail, the cost of replanting, and the yield potential of the replanted crop.

This paper analyzes the household decision <b>to</b> <b>replant</b> mangroves in four case study villages in Thailand in line with existing studies on the voluntary contribution to step-level public goods and the decision by adult members of a household to devote some labor to an outside activity. The null hypothesis that dependency on mangrove-based income has no influence on participation in replanting is rejected. Awareness of community conservation efforts and of {{the environmental impacts of}} shrimp farms also motivates participation. Allocation of male and female labors <b>to</b> <b>replanting</b> is also found to be jointly determined. ...|$|R
