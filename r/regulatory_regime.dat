5|$|The {{development}} of wind power capacity in South Australia has been encouraged {{by a number}} of factors. These include the Australian Government's Renewable Energy Target, which require electricity retailers to source a proportion of energy from renewable sources, incentives from the South Australian Government including a supportive <b>regulatory</b> <b>regime</b> and a payroll tax rebate scheme for large scale renewable energy developments. Also the state's proximity to the Roaring forties means there are high quality wind resources for wind farms to exploit. In mid-2009, RenewablesSA was established by the South Australian Government to encourage further investment in renewable energy in the state.|$|E

40|$|The {{liberalisation}} and privatisation {{of network}} utilities {{lead to the}} establishment of <b>regulatory</b> <b>regimes.</b> On the national level, <b>regulatory</b> <b>regimes</b> not only include a highly visible single regulatory body, they also combine three institutions: a sector-specific regulatory agency, a ministry and a competition authority. These three organisations are the central institutions within the regime. They share competencies and interact with each other to steer national utility sectors. From a comparative administrative research perspective, this article explores developments in utility <b>regulatory</b> <b>regimes</b> in Britain and Germany, especially focussing on telecommunications, energy (electricity and gas) and rail. The goal is to show that <b>regulatory</b> <b>regimes</b> are not stable entities, but that there are 'post-reform changes' which result in redesigning regimes over time. To create and correct markets, there are ongoing modifications of regimes aimed at coping with the sector-specific changes. With respect to economic regulatory competencies of <b>regulatory</b> <b>regimes,</b> cross-country and cross-sectoral institutional dynamics are explored. This article reveals that there are general converging trends in Britain's <b>regulatory</b> <b>regimes</b> and partial convergence in Germany's regimes. An Anglo-German cross-country comparison shows some similarities; for example, on the role of ministries within the regimes. However, the developments in the regimes do not result in overall cross-sectoral convergence. There is continuing divergence in the <b>regulatory</b> <b>regimes...</b>|$|R

By revisiting several historical models of regulatory development, including Bernstein 2 ̆ 7 s classic life-cycle model, and then by analyzing six case studies from the US and UK, for example, we explore the possibility that <b>regulatory</b> <b>regimes</b> vary more prominently along the temporal dimension rather than along spatial ones.

50|$|There are, of course, great {{differences}} among the various different types of <b>regulatory</b> <b>regimes.</b> Some merely {{provide a framework for}} State action, whereas others establish guidelines addressed to domestic administrative agencies, and others still impact directly upon national civil society actors. Some <b>regulatory</b> <b>regimes</b> create their own implementation mechanisms, while others rely on national or regional authorities for this task. To settle disputes, some <b>regulatory</b> <b>regimes</b> have established judicial (or quasi-judicial) bodies, or refer to those of different regimes; while others resort to “softer” forms, such as negotiation. Within this framework, the traditional mechanisms based on State consent as expressed through treaties or custom are simply no longer capable of accounting for all global activities.|$|R

Facilities that operate primarily to take advantage of commodity arbitrage opportunities are expected to have different cash flow benefits than ones primarily used to ensure seasonal supply reliability.

25|$|Gene {{regulatory}} {{networks are}} generally {{thought to be}} made up of a few highly connected nodes (hubs) and many poorly connected nodes nested within a hierarchical <b>regulatory</b> <b>regime.</b> Thus gene regulatory networks approximate a hierarchical scale free network topology. This is consistent with the view that most genes have limited pleiotropy and operate within regulatory modules. This structure is thought to evolve due to the preferential attachment of duplicated genes to more highly connected genes. Recent work has also shown that natural selection tends to favor networks with sparse connectivity.|$|E
25|$|To {{address the}} excesses {{in the banking}} sector that precipitated the crisis, Obama signed the 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This law limited bank {{risk-taking}} and overhauled the outdated <b>regulatory</b> <b>regime</b> that was ineffective in monitoring the non-depository or shadow banking sector {{at the core of}} the crisis, which had outgrown the traditional depository banking sector. It also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. However, it did not breakup the largest banks (which had grown even larger due to forced mergers during the crisis) or separate investment and depository banking, as the Glass-Steagal Act had done. Only a few Republicans in Congress voted for the law.|$|E

25|$|Abrams (2006) {{argues that}} the eclipse of {{liberalism}} {{was caused by a}} grass-roots populist revolt, often with a Fundamentalist and anti-modern theme, abetted by corporations eager to weaken labor unions and the <b>regulatory</b> <b>regime</b> of the New Deal. The success of liberalism in the first place, he argues, came from efforts of a liberal elite that had entrenched itself in key social, political, and especially judicial positions. These elites, Abrams contends, imposed their brand of liberalism from within some of the least democratic and most insulated institutions, especially the universities, foundations, independent regulatory agencies, and the Supreme Court. With only a weak popular base, liberalism was vulnerable to a populist counterrevolution by the nation's democratic or majoritarian forces.|$|E
25|$|The Broadcasting Act of 1990 instigated the 1991 {{franchise}} auction round, {{in which}} companies had {{to bid for}} the regions. Mersey Television, a company producing the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside, bid £35m compared to Granada's £9m but Granada won as Mersey's package {{did not meet the}} 'quality threshold' applied by the Independent Television Commission. This requirement disadvantaged companies with no previous franchise experience. Granada owned popular television series such as Coronation Street, which it threatened to sell to satellite TV if the franchise was lost. The government responded by relaxing the <b>regulatory</b> <b>regime,</b> so that ITV contractors could take over other companies, and Granada bought several companies. Some at the company considered ITV could survive only as a single merged entity to have sufficient resources to produce big-budget programmes, a concern that increased when BSkyB began to take ITV's viewing share, leading to less advertising revenue, the source of ITV's income.|$|E

40|$|The mass demonstrations {{that led}} to the Jasmine Revolution in late 2010 and early 2011 have radically changed the media and {{communications}} landscape in Tunisia. All forms of information technology were until recently either heavily regulated by the Tunisian state or were owned by individuals with close links to then-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. This analysis looks at <b>regulatory</b> <b>regimes</b> across three media and communications technologies during the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia—Internet, television and mobile phones—and shows that the <b>regulatory</b> <b>regimes</b> of media and communications technologies co-evolved with the protests. As expression about public protests became increasingly pervasive within these media, efforts to control them became increasingly restrictive.

2500|$|The {{spectrum}} {{property rights}} model is often critiqued for potentially leading to artificial scarcity and the hold-up problem. The hold-up problem {{refers to the}} difficulty in aggregation of the spectrum [...] resources (which would be required for high bandwidth applications), as the individual spectrum owners could ask for very high compensation in return of their contribution. Since spectrum is a scarce finite good, there is a perverse incentive to not use it at all. Participants and existing spectrum owners in the spectrum market can preemptively buy spectrum, then warehouse it to prevent existing or newcomer competitors from utilizing it. The existing spectrum owner's official plans for this warehoused spectrum would be save it for an unknown future use, and therefore not utilize it at all for the foreseeable future. [...] In a partial or incomplete [...] "spectrum as property" [...] <b>regulatory</b> <b>regime,</b> incumbent and grandfathered owners who obtained spectrum under the old cause and merit policy, can obtain windfalls in selling the spectrum they obtained for no cost under the earlier <b>regulatory</b> <b>regime.</b> When a <b>regulatory</b> <b>regime</b> changed to the property model, the original merit and cause guidelines for incumbent and grandfathered users are often removed, and no regulatory review mechanism exists to check if the merit guidelines are still being followed, and if not, revoke the spectrum license from the incumbent spectrum owner and reissue the spectrum to a new user under old merit guidelines or sell the spectrum inline with the new [...] "spectrum as property" [...] policy.|$|E
