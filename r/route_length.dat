5|$|Rieber has {{suggested}} a {{package for the}} politicians, where he would create a company that would borrow money to build both the Ulriken Tunnel, a shortening of the line from Hønefoss to Sandvika (the Ringerike Line) and electrify the railway. Since NSB based their fares on the <b>route</b> <b>length</b> traveled, financing would be covered by a surcharge equal to the distance saved; ticket price would remain the same and within twenty years the debt would be covered. The government opposed the suggestion—Trygve Bratteli commenting {{that even though the}} financing was private, it would still have to use the same funding as government debt, and would jeopardize other projects, like the Nordland Line.|$|E
25|$|Maximum <b>route</b> <b>length</b> {{is closely}} related to diameter: the maximum number of hops in any {{shortest}} path between nodes. Clearly, the network's worst case <b>route</b> <b>length</b> is at least as large as its diameter, so DHTs are limited by the degree/diameter tradeoff that is fundamental in graph theory. <b>Route</b> <b>length</b> can be greater than diameter, since the greedy routing algorithm may not find shortest paths.|$|E

25|$|Railway {{tracks are}} laid upon land owned or leased by the railway company. Owing to the {{desirability}} of maintaining modest grades, rails will often be laid in circuitous routes in hilly or mountainous terrain. <b>Route</b> <b>length</b> and grade requirements can be reduced {{by the use of}} alternating cuttings, bridges and tunnels – all of which can greatly increase the capital expenditures required to develop a right of way, while significantly reducing operating costs and allowing higher speeds on longer radius curves. In densely urbanized areas, railways are sometimes laid in tunnels to minimize the effects on existing properties.|$|E

25|$|The GWR was {{the only}} one of the big four to take its name from a predecessor. Its total <b>route</b> <b>length</b> was 3800 miles (6116km), much of which had been built to handle the coal traffic from south Wales. Though this {{appeared}} to be a great coup for the GWR, the coal traffic declined significantly as the use of coal as a naval fuel declined, and within a decade the GWR was itself the largest single user of Welsh coal. The 1920s also saw the introduction of the GWR's most famous locomotives – the Castle and King classes developed by C. B. Collett. The 1930s brought hard times, and the records set by the Castles and Kings were surpassed by other companies, but the company remained in relatively good financial health despite the Depression.|$|E

40|$|Blocking {{probability}} {{has been}} one of the key performance indexes in the design of wavelength-routed all-optical WDM networks. Existing research has demonstrated that an effective Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) algorithm and wavelength conversion are two primary vehicles for improving the blocking performance. However, these two issues have largely been investigated separately; in particular the existing RWA algorithms have seldom considered the presence of wavelength conversion. In this paper, we firstly demonstrate that the existing dynamic RWA algorithms do not work well in the presence of wavelength conversion as they usually only take into account the current traffic, and do not explicitly consider the <b>route</b> <b>lengths.</b> We then propose a weighted least-congestion routing and first-fit wavelength assignment (WLCR-FF) algorithm that considers both the current traffic load and the <b>route</b> <b>lengths</b> jointly. We further introduce an analytical model that can evaluate the blocking performance for WLCR algorithm. We carry out extensive numerical studies over typical topologies including ring, mesh-torus, and the 14 -node NSFNET; and compare the performance of WLCR-FF with a wide variety of existing routing algorithms including static routing, fixed-alternate routing and least-loaded routing. The results conclusively demonstrate that the proposed WLCR-FF algorithm can achieve much better blocking performance in the presence of sparse or/and full wavelength conversion...|$|R

40|$|An ad hoc {{network is}} a {{collection}} of wireless mobile hosts forming a temporary network without the aid of any established infrastructure or centralized administration. In such an environment, it may be necessary for one mobile host to enlist the aid of other hosts in forwarding a packet to its destination, due to the limited range of each mobile host’s wireless transmissions. This paper presents a protocol for routing in ad hoc networks that uses dynamic source routing. The protocol adapts quickly to routing changes when host movement is frequent, yet requires little or no overhead during periods in which hosts move less frequently. Based on results from a packet-level simulation of mobile hosts operating in an ad hoc network, the protocol performs well over a variety of environmental conditions such as host density and movement rates. For all but the highest rates of host movement simulated, the overhead of the protocol is quite low, falling to just 1 % of total data packets transmitted for moderate movement rates in a network of 24 mobile hosts. In all cases, the difference in <b>length</b> between the <b>routes</b> used and the optimal <b>route</b> <b>lengths</b> is negligible, and in most cases, <b>route</b> <b>lengths</b> are on average within a factor of 1. 01 of optimal. 1...|$|R
