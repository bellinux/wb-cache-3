5000|$|Rack Rail {{comes in}} two {{different}} commonly used forms. Tapped/threaded rack rail has round holes tapped for 10/32 UNF screws. The other common form of rack rail is square hole <b>rack</b> <b>strip</b> which has square holes for M6 captive nuts that are clipped into the holes as needed to mount equipment.|$|E
50|$|A Rack rail, or <b>rack</b> <b>strip,</b> is used {{to mount}} rackable {{electronic}} hardware and 19-inch rack mount accessories within a 19-inch rack. Within a rack {{a minimum of two}} rack rails are required to mount equipment. The height of rack rail is determined by the number of rack units required for mounting the equipment.|$|E
25|$|The first green Routemasters, {{apart from}} {{prototype}} CRL4, now RMC4, were 69 RMCs (Routemaster Coach) for Green Line work. These {{were the same}} length as the RMs but had luxury seating, luggage <b>racks,</b> <b>strip</b> lights and platform doors. The later 43 RCLs (Routemaster Coach Lengthened) were the same length as the RMLs but again with coach seating and platform doors.|$|R

50|$|In some countries, strips {{have been}} {{replaced}} by electronic equivalents. These generally use touch-screens to show the flight information, while still trying to keep some of the physical aspects of paper <b>strips</b> and <b>strip</b> <b>racks.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{microtexture}} of the near-surface Martian {{soil was}} sensed with three diagnostic parameters: (1) the albedo A {{at normal incidence}} and phase angle 5 degrees, which relates to {{the composition of the}} top surface exposed layer; (2) the polarization parameter b characterizes the texture of the top surface layer in terms of grain size; and (3) the thermal inertia parameter I which refers to the soil compaction through the first few decimeters below the top surface sensed by polarimetry, in terms of size for the pieces making a granular regolith. Parameter b was derived from instrument VPM on board the Soviet spacecraft MARS- 5, inertial I is from IRTM on the American Viking, and albedo A from both. The polarimetric scans <b>racked</b> <b>strips</b> covering two contrasted regions, the dark hued Mare Erythraeum, and the adjacent bright orange Thaumasia. Erythraem is characterized everywhere by a same type of terrain, despite the large geomorphological diversity of the surface. There is an ubiquitous coating or mantling with small dark grains, of both albedo 12. 7 percent and particle size 10 to 20 microns, above a subsurface dislocation in pieces around 300 to 600 microns. A simple model is with sand-size particles completely coated with 15 micron dark grains...|$|R
5000|$|These models use a <b>rack</b> (toothed metal <b>strip)</b> that meshes with a {{gear that}} turns a rotary encoder. Claimed {{accuracy}} of [...]002 inches per foot, though users frequently report it Is much more accurate, with no measurable deviation over several feet of travel. Debris getting between the gear and rack is a concern.|$|R
5000|$|Significant in its retail [...] "firsts" [...] was the {{over-the-counter}} sale of {{pure gold}} in 1974 when bullion sale was legalized, {{as well as}} the introduction of the Rudi Gernreich topless bathing suit (Hess's was {{one of only a handful}} of stores in the entire country to carry the suits, notably failing to sell a single one). Biannual sales events at Hess's were often semi-disastrous as shoppers who waited outside for the store to open in the morning would proceed to trample each other and store employees to get to discounted merchandise, leaving the shelves and <b>racks</b> completely <b>stripped</b> bare afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, the fix posting area {{method was}} the main {{technique}} used in U.S. en route system prior to the 1960s, for example, when en route radar became more widespread. This method evolved from similar techniques used in railroad dispatch. It simplifies conflict detection because aircraft on different routes can only possibly conflict at intersection points with other routes, or with aircraft on the same route. Each intersection point ("fix posting area") in the sector is made into a separate bay on the <b>strip</b> <b>rack,</b> and multiple <b>strips</b> are printed for each aircraft, one per bay. The controller then sorts strips within each bay by the estimated time the aircraft is expected over that point. Only aircraft estimated to cross within 10 minutes of each other are considered possible conflicts, at which point altitudes are then compared {{to determine if there}} actually is a conflict. Aircraft on the same route however (in either direction) must be checked for conflict regardless of time over the intersection.|$|R
40|$|Construction {{continued}} {{during the}} monthly reporting compliance period focusing {{primarily on the}} generator step-up transformer (GSU), steam turbine generator (STG) foundation, and {{heat recovery steam generators}} (HRSG); key components of the Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility’s infrastructure. There were no significant delays or changes to the project schedule. The project is approximately 41. 9 % complete (cumulative through July 22, 2012) and construction is at 25. 80 %. Work continues to proceed with engineering, procurement, permitting and compliance (i. e., environmental monitors) as well as scheduling and construction planning. In addition, submittals to the Chief Building Official (CBO) continue as the site undergoes transformation. Harder Mechanical continues work on the new HRSG duct sections and installing pipe rack foundation.

5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{techniques}} controllers use to organize flight progress strips in order to best detect conflicts: grouped together by altitude, or grouped together by route intersection points (fix posting area). Altitude grouping is the easiest and most common method when most aircraft in the sector tend to be level at a cruising altitude, such as in trans-oceanic sectors. Each aircraft's strip is placed in a [...] "bay" [...] (labeled section of the <b>strip</b> <b>rack)</b> depending on its altitude. Because aircraft cruising at different altitudes will never conflict regardless of route of flight or estimated times, they don't need to be checked against each other. Only aircraft at the same altitude (i.e. in the same bay) need to be further evaluated. If an aircraft needs to transition to a new altitude (whether changing cruising level, or descending to or climbing from an airport), it only needs to be checked against others in the bays between the current altitude and destination altitude.|$|R
