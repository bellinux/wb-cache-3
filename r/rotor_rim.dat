The predominant failure mode involved blade fragments, 84 percent of which were contained. No uncontained disk failures occurred and although fewer <b>rotor</b> <b>rim</b> and seal failures occurred, 100 percent and 50 percent, respectively, were uncontained.

40|$|In 2013, cracks {{were found}} in the radius of the {{dovetail}} slots of the <b>rotor</b> <b>rim</b> sheets in generator 1 of Juktan hydro power plant in Västerbotten, Sweden. The cracks were estimated to be too deep to be able to repair and Alstom conducted an investigation on the cause of fracture. The investigation {{came to the conclusion that}} the radius was too small and that the new <b>rotor</b> <b>rim</b> sheets should have a six times greater fillet radius. However, it has not been investigated whether the material structure or the manufacturing process may have an impact on the crack initiation and following propagation that is the focus of this report. Parts of the dovetail slots were cut out and characterized with XRF, SEM and LOM. Further mechanical characterizations were done according to Vickers. From the SEM and LOM micrographs a high amount of large (10 μm) and cubic particles {{were found in}} the microstructure. The micrographs also showed a deformation of the microstructure and the hardness test showed a deformation hardening near the edge where the sheet had been punched. The edge surface of the sheet also had notches. The large and hard particles in the microstructure impair the mechanical properties of the steel. Furthermore, the hardening effect combined with the notches will make a good crack initiation point. Therefore, there is a higher possibility that a crack will initiate in the radius of the dovetail slots where large stresses occur...|$|E
40|$|In 2011 Lubna Nasrin {{designed}} an optimized in-wheel axial flux motor for {{the competition}} Shell Eco-Marathon. A motor {{was built for}} the 2012 competition by Fredrik V. Endresen. Testing of this motor showed however that the performance was nothing like the one anticipated by Nasrin?s. The conclusion was that the production methods were not good enough {{and this was the}} main reason for the poor result. A new motor was built for use in the 2013 competition. Several design improvements over the old motor which was built in 2010 has been made. Litz wire is used in the stator and Halbach array permanent arrangement in the <b>rotors.</b> <b>Rims,</b> axle and other mechanical parts have also been made brand new this year {{to try to make the}} best possible design. The assembly didn?t go without problems, but in the end the motor was fit to the car and tested. It was used in the competition where the team ended up with a third place in the battery electric class. Several tests were performed on the motor to identify how well it performed compared to the FEM results. Question marks have however been raised when it comes to the results of the test due to problems aligning the motor in the test bench. The results indicate rather high rotational losses, but also an induced voltage 35 % lower than anticipated. This should not be critical though as the theoretical efficiency, rotational losses discarded, still is 99 % with this value. The high eddy current and friction losses measured do however ruin the real efficiency of the machine. </p...|$|R
40|$|Gas Turbine <b>rotor</b> stator <b>rim</b> seal {{problem was}} studied by using {{experimental}} and CFD method {{based on a}} one stage turbine model. Part one focused on the mechanism of ingestion and distribution of ingested flow in rotor stator cavity. The {{results showed that the}} non-uniform pressure distribution of annulus flow is the main factor cause hot gas ingestion. The cavity can be well sealed when the pressure in it is higher than that of annulus flow, otherwise the ingestion happens. The tangential velocity of main flow will enhance the ingestion process. The mixing process between sealing flow and ingestion flow happens near the seal clearance and then goes into the lower location of the cavity by the entrainment effect induced by rotor disc. All these factors should be considered and well organized when new and highly efficient rim seal structure is designed...|$|R

40|$|The rotor bracket {{is a key}} {{component}} of the generator rotor with cracks in the rotor bracket leading to rubbing between the rotor and stator, which threatens safe operation of the unit. The <b>rotor</b> <b>rim</b> is so complicated that the equivalent radial stiffness of rim was determined by numerical simulation other than engineering experience. A comprehensive numerical method including finite element analyses and the contact method for multibody dynamics has been used to design the split rotor bracket. The com-putational results showed that cracks would occur in the initial design of the bracket when the turbine operated at the runaway speed, and the bracket design should be improved. The improved design of the bracket was strong enough to avoid cracks and rub between the rotor and stator. This design experience will help improve the design of split rotor brackets for bulb turbine generators...|$|E
40|$|In {{almost all}} {{production}} of electricity the rotating machines serves as {{an important part of}} the energy transformation system. In hydropower units, a hydraulic turbine connected to a generator converts the potential energy stored in the water reservoir into electrical energy in the generator. An essential part of this energy conversion is the rotating system of which the turbine and the generator are part. During the last century the machines for electricity production have been developed from a few mega watts per unit up to several hundreds mega watts per unit. The development and increasing of size of the hydropower machines have also brought a need for new techniques. The most important developments are the increased efficiency of the turbines and generators, new types of bearings and the introduction of new materials. Vibration measurements are still the most reliable and commonly used method to avoid failure during commissioning, for periodic maintenance, and as protection of the systems. Knowledge of the bearing forces in different operational modes is essential in order to estimate the degeneration of components and to avoid failures. In the appended Paper A, a method has been described for measurement of bearing load by use of strain gauges installed on the guide bearing bracket. This technique can determine the magnitude and direction of both static and dynamic loads acting on the bearing. This method also makes it possible to find the cause of the radial bearing force among the various eccentricities and disturbances in the system. A principal cause of many failures in large electrical machines is the occurrence of high radial forces due to misalignment between rotor and stator, rotor imbalance or disturbance from the turbine. In this thesis, two rotor models are suggested for calculation of forces and moments acting on the generator shaft depending on misalignment between stator and rotor. These two methods are described in appended papers B and C. In Paper B, a linear model is proposed for an eccentric generator rotor subjected to a radial magnetic force. Both the radial force and the bending moment affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the rotor spider hub deviates from the centre of the <b>rotor</b> <b>rim.</b> The magnetic pull force acting on the rotor is assumed to be proportional to the rotor displacement. In Paper C, a non-linear model is proposed for analysis of an eccentric rotor subjected to radial magnetic force. Both the radial and bending moments affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the generator spider hub deviates from the centre of the generator rim. The magnetic forces acting on the rotor are assumed to be a non-linear function of the air-gap between the rotor and stator. The stability analysis shows that the rotor can become unstable for small initial eccentricities if the <b>rotor</b> <b>rim</b> position relative to the rotor hub is included in the analysis. The analysis also shows that the natural frequencies can decrease and the rotor response can increase if the <b>rotor</b> <b>rim</b> position in relation to the rotor spider is considered. The endurance of hydropower rotor components is often associated with the dynamic loads acting on the rotating system and the number of start-stop cycles of the unit. Measurements together with analysis of the rotordynamics are often the most powerful methods available to improve understanding of the cause of the dynamic load. The method for measurement of bearing load presented in this thesis makes it possible to investigate the dynamic as well as the static loads as acting on the bearing brackets. This can be done using the suggested method with high accuracy and without redesign of the bearings. During commissioning of hydropower unit, measurements of shaft vibrations and forces are the most reliable method to investigate the status of the rotating system. Generator rotor models suggested in this work will increase the precision of the calculated behavior of the rotor. Calculation of the rotor behavior is important before the generator is put in operation, after rehabilitation or when new machines will be installed. Godkänd; 2005; 20061214 (haneit...|$|E

In Paper E, the effect of damping rods was included in the analysis of the magnetic pull force. The resulting force was found to be reduced significantly when the damper rods were taken into account. An interesting effect of the rotor damper rods was that they reduced the eccentricity forces and introduced a force component perpendicular to the direction of eccentricity. The results from the finite-element simulations were used to determine how the forces affect the stability of the generator rotor. Damped natural eigenfrequencies and the damping ratio for load and no-load conditions were investigated. When applying the forces computed in the time- dependent model, the damped natural eigenfrequencies were found to increase and the stability of the generator rotor was found to be reduced, compared with when the forces were computed in a stationary model. Damage due to contact between the runner and the discharge ring have been observed in several hydroelectric power units. The damage can cause high repair costs to the runner and the discharge ring as well as considerable production losses. In Paper F a rotor model of a 45 MW hydropower unit is used for the analysis of the rotor dynamical phenomena occurring due to contact between the runner and the discharge ring for different grades of lateral force on the turbine and bearing damping. The rotor model consists of a generator rotor and a turbine, which are connected to an elastic shaft supported by three isotropic bearings. The discrete representation of the rotor model consist of 32 degrees of freedom. To increase the speed of the analysis, the size of the model has been reduced with the IRS method to a system with 8 degrees of freedom. The results show that a small gap between the turbine and discharge ring can be dangerous, due to the risk of contact with high contact forces as a consequence. It has also been observed that backward whirl can occur and in some cases the turbine motion becomes quasi-periodic or chaotic. The endurance of hydropower rotor components is often associated with the dynamic loads acting on the rotating system and the number of start-stop cycles of the unit. Measurements, together with analysis of the rotor dynamics, are often the most powerful methods available to improve understanding of the cause of the dynamic load. The method for measurement of the bearing load presented in this thesis makes it possible to investigate the dynamic as well as the static loads acting on the bearing brackets.

Calculation of the rotor behaviour is important before a generator is put in operation, after overhaul or when a new machine is to be installed. Godkänd; 2008; 20081111 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|The rim-rotor rotary-ramjet engine (R 4 E) {{is a new}} propulsion-system {{design with}} the {{potential}} to significantly improve power density and reduce complexity of conventional gas turbines, thus making it an interesting alternative for future transportation and stationary power systems. This paper presents the structural design and an experiment validation of a proof-of-concept prototype that can sustain 560 m=s (200 krpm) and transient combustion, which is initiated by an integrated-ignition system. Ahigh-strength carbon-polyetheretherketone (PEEK) composite winding is used around the ramjet blades to support the high g load and includes the flame holder. A 6. 5 -cm prototype is spun up to 188 krpm at rim temperature, reaching 473 -K for short periods without failure or rotordynamics issues. Several ignitions and high-temperature combustion of 1 s were achieved at 80, 000 rpm. High-combustion temperature for 1 s led to the failure of turbine blades. Total and partial failures of the <b>rim</b> <b>rotor</b> demonstrated the concept safety, as all projections were contained without important damage. Copyright 9 2012 by the authors.
