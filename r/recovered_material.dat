500|$|After the new {{specimens}} were announced, it was rumoured that a looted skull {{had found}} its way to a European museum through the black market. The poached elements were spotted in a private European collection by the French fossil trader François Escuillé, who notified Belgian palaeontologist Pascal Godefroit about them in 2011. They suspected the remains belonged to Deinocheirus, and contacted the Korean-Mongolian team. Escuillé subsequently acquired the fossils and donated them to the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. The <b>recovered</b> <b>material</b> consisted of a skull, a left hand, and feet, which had been collected in Mongolia, sold to a Japanese buyer, and resold to a German party. The team concluded that these elements belonged to specimen MPC-D 100/127, as the single leftover toe bone fit perfectly into the unprepared matrix of a poached foot, the bone and matrix matched in colour, and because the elements belonged to an individual of the same size, with no overlap in skeletal elements. On May 1, 2014, the fossils were repatriated to Mongolia by a delegation from the Belgian Museum, during a ceremony held at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. The reunited skeleton was deposited at the Central Museum of Mongolian Dinosaurs in Ulaanbaatar, along with a Tarbosaurus skeleton which had also been brought back after being stolen. American palaeontologist Thomas R. Holtz stated in an interview that the new Deinocheirus remains looked like the [...] "product of a secret love affair between a hadrosaur and Gallimimus".|$|E

5000|$|Fokker Standard Universal G-CAJD is {{also known}} as [...] "The Ghost of Charron Lake". It was lost in a snow storm on 10 December 1931. After a 30-year search for the rare bush plane, it was {{discovered}} in 2005. A Western Canada Aviation Museum search team (the Fokker Aircraft Recovery Team, F.A.R.T.), using sophisticated side scan sonar technology, finally located the aircraft literally [...] "parked" [...] on the lake bottom. In July 2006, the Ghost's engine was returned to Winnipeg, along with several artifacts. In October, the underwater archaeology team returned to the recovery site and towed the tail section to shallower waters. A further expedition was undertaken in 2007 to recover more of the Fokker for future display at the museum.

5000|$|To {{retrieve}} the treasure of the Egypt, Commendatore Quaglia quickly outfitted a second ship, originally given the name Maurétanie, and renaming it Artiglio II; it was, however, soon generally called [...] "Artiglio".

The recovery occurred at a depth deemed impossible to reach at the time by divers, who used the famous [...] "torretta butoscopica" [...] invented by Gianni, dropped to -130 meters, to direct the work of buckets operated aboard the Artiglio. This event brought great prestige to Italy, the achievement being acclaimed worldwide by heads of state and government of the time. [...] Congratulations were sent from all over the world, including from George V (King of the United Kingdom), Benito Mussolini, and then-communications minister Costanzo Ciano.|$|E
50|$|All Kundurosaurus {{specimens}} {{were collected}} in the Kundur locality. The site belongs to the Wodehouseia spinata - Aquilapollenites subtilis palynozone, dating to the Maastrichtian stage, probably the Late Maastrichtian, of the Late Cretaceous period, about 67-66 million years ago. The Kundur site was discovered by Vladimir A. Nagorny in 1990. He collected fossil bones in a road section along the Chita - Khabarovsk highway {{near the village of}} Kundur and sent them to Yuri L. Bolotsky. Large-scale excavations started at Kundur in 1999. Besides the abundant Olorotitan arharensis material, it has yielded many disarticulated saurolophine specimens. All these specimens were assigned to Kundurosaurus because the describers considered the <b>recovered</b> <b>material</b> to be homogeneous, and suggested that {{there is no reason to}} believe that more than one single saurolophine taxon lived in the Kundur area by latest Cretaceous period. Kundur is one of four rich dinosaur localities that have been discovered in the southeastern part ("Lower Zeya depression") of Zeya-Bureya sedimentary basin, eastern Asia: Jiayin and Wulaga localities are located in the Yuliangze Formation of northern Heilongjiang Province, China and Blagoveschensk and Kundur localities are located in the Udurchukan Formation of southern Amur Region, Russia. In each locality, the dinosaur fauna is largely dominated by lambeosaurine hadrosaurids (Charonosaurus jiayinensis and some non-diagnostic material of Mandschurosaurus amurensis from Jiayin, Sahaliyania from Wulaga, Amurosaurus from Blagoveschensk, and Olorotitan from Kundur), but the indeterminate hadrosaurid Arkharavia, from Kundur, and saurolophine (non-crested or solid-crested) hadrosaurids are also represented (Saurolophus kryschtofovici and other non-diagnostic material of M. amurensis from Jiayin, Wulagasaurus from Wulaga, Kerberosaurus from Blagoveschensk and Kundurosaurus from Kundur).|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, the {{discovery}} of two new Deinocheirus specimens was announced before the annual Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP) conference by Lee, Barsbold, Currie, and colleagues. Housed at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, these two headless individuals were given the specimen numbers MPC-D 100/127 and MPC-D 100/128. MPC-D 100/128, a subadult specimen, was found by scientists in the Altan Ula IV locality (coordinates: [...] ) of the Nemegt Formation during the Korea-Mongolia International Dinosaur Expedition in 2006, but had already been damaged by fossil poachers. The second specimen, MPC-D 100/127, was found by scientists in the Bugiin Tsav locality (coordinates: [...] ) in 2009. It is slightly larger than the holotype, {{and it could be}} clearly identified as Deinocheirus by its left forelimb, and therefore helped identify the earlier collected specimen as Deinocheirus. The specimen had also been excavated by poachers, who had removed the skull, hands and feet, but left behind a single toe bone. It had probably been looted after 2002, based on money left in the quarry. Currie stated in an interview that it was a policy of their team to investigate quarries after they had been looted and recover anything of significance, and that finding any new Deinocheirus fossils was cause for celebration, even without the poached parts. A virtual model of Deinocheirus revealed at the SVP presentation brought applause from the crowd of attending palaeontologists, and Scottish palaeontologist Stephen L. Brusatte stated he had never been as surprised by a SVP talk, though new fossils are routinely presented at the conference.After the new specimens were announced, it was rumoured that a looted skull had found its way to a European museum through the black market. The poached elements were spotted in a private European collection by the French fossil trader François Escuillé, who notified Belgian palaeontologist Pascal Godefroit about them in 2011.
