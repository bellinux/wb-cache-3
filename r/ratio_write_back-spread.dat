40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the factors that}} shape Malaysian learners' academic self-concept in a specific subject, academic writing (in L 2). Data were generated through a mixed methods approach, with an initial survey of 170 students, followed by two semi-structured interviews with each of eight student participants. The quantitative {{phase of the study}} identified that there were different self-concepts involved in the formulation of self-concept in academic writing (e. g., self-concept in English and self-concept as a writer). The qualitative findings from four student participants (selected from the eight) further expanded on these and identified interrelated internal and external factors that shape the L 2 learners' self-concept and engagement in academic writing. The study proposed that that there is a complementary relationship between multiple internal and/or external factors that are available to students, and that this may influence the nature of their actions in the academic writing class. Overall, this study demonstrated that an L 2 learner's self-concept in academic writing is complex and multifaceted and that Malaysia's socio-historical setting tended to have a direct impact in the formulation of this academic self-concept. In light of these findings from the study, it is recommended that institutions provide a supportive educational environment (i. e., appropriate student-teacher <b>ratio,</b> <b>writing</b> support) in order to develop a positive foundation for self-concept enhancement and student engagement in academic writing...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a linearly elastic body {{consisting of two}} equal symmetrically arranged layers (or half-planes) connected by a structured interface as a prospective crack path. The interface is comprised by periodic discrete system of bonds. In the initial state with no external forces, the bonds {{are assumed to be}} stressed {{in such a way that}} tensile and compressive forces of the same value alternate. In the general considerations, the layers are assumed to be of a general, unspecified periodic structure, where such self-equilibrated residual stresses can also exist. A two-line chain and an anisotropic lattice are examined as illustrative examples. We consider the states of the body-with-a-crack under the residual stresses and under a combined action of the remote forces and residual stresses. Analytical solutions to the considered problems are presented. The solutions are based on a selective discrete transform introduced. In particular, it is found that a formula for local-to-global energy release <b>ratio,</b> <b>written</b> in terms of the Wiener-Hopf equation kernel, is very general. We show that the residual stresses can manifest themselves in a number of phenomena such as the crack bridging, `porous' in front of the crack and crack growth irregularities. We also demonstrate analytically and graphically that the residual stresses can result in increase as well as in decrease of the crack resistance depending on the internal energy level. The quasi-static considerations suggest different scenarios of the crack growth depending on the internal energy level. Comment: 30 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{view of a}} {{possible}} application in optical data storage devices, diffraction grating efficiency of an organic dye, Acid Fuchsin doped in PMMA matrix was studied under excitation with CW diode pumped Nd: YAG laser at 532 nm. The open aperture Z-scan of dye doped polymer displayed saturable absorption and the closed aperture Z-scan of the samples exhibited negative nonlinearity. The diffraction efficiency of the grating is {{the ratio of the}} intensity of the first order diffracted power to the incident read beam power. The dye doped polymer films were found to be good media for recording. It is observed that the formation of gratings strongly depend on the concentration of dye in the polymer film, the intensity <b>ratios</b> of the <b>writing</b> beams and the angle between the writing beams. It has been found that efficient writing can be made at an angle of 20 and when the intensity <b>ratio</b> of the <b>writing</b> beams is unity.
