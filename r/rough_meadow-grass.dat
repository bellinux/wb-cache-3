25|$|Twenty {{acres of}} fields around {{the centre of}} the hamlet of Little Langdale were {{designated}} a SSSI in 1989 as one of the only four remaining meadows of SSSI quality in South Cumbria. The habitat varies from floodplain near the Brathay to higher, dryer haymeadow with both being home {{to a wide variety of}} herb, grass and flower species. Grasses found in these meadows include sweet vernal-grass, wood-crane's-bill, common bent, crested dog's tail, red fescue, meadow fescue, Yorkshire-fog, smooth meadow-grass, <b>rough</b> <b>meadow-grass,</b> cock's-foot, soft brome and perennial rye-grass. Perhaps the rarest species found there is the globe-flower.|$|E

50|$|Poa trivialis (rough bluegrass; UK: rough-stalked meadow-grass or <b>rough</b> <b>meadow-grass),</b> is a {{perennial}} plant, but regarded in the US as an ornamental plant. It {{is part of}} the grass family.|$|E
50|$|These woods {{are one of}} {{the largest}} {{remnants}} of the ancient Royal Forest of Rockingham. They are mainly ash and pedunculate oak on wet calcareous clay soils. The ground flora is diverse, and there are grasses such as tufted hair-grass, <b>rough</b> <b>meadow-grass</b> and wood melick.|$|E
50|$|The {{wild fauna}} {{of the valley}} is similar to other nearby valleys and {{includes}} the badger, grey squirrel, hare, hedgehog, rabbit, roe deer, red deer, red fox, stoat, weasel, buzzard, cuckoo, house martin, peregrine, raven, ring ouzel, swallow, swift, and slowworm. Rarely the adder, otter and red squirrel are seen. Pine marten, previously rare, are no longer seen in the valley. The tarn shore supports a population of great crested grebe and the dark green fritillary butterfly.Twenty acres of fields around {{the centre of the}} hamlet of Little Langdale were designated a SSSI in 1989 as one of the only four remaining meadows of SSSI quality in South Cumbria.

30|$|As {{regards the}} taxa {{with the highest}} pollen concentrations, Ambrosia genus has only one species, namely Ambrosia artemisiifolia (Common Ragweed) in Szeged region that appears both in the urban {{environment}} and in the countryside. Ragweed occurs especially frequently west of the city. The ruling north-western winds can easily transport pollen into the city. Several species of Poaceae family, namely Agropyron repens (Common Couch), Poa trivialis (<b>Rough</b> <b>Meadow-grass),</b> as well as Poa bulbosa (Bulbous Meadow-grass) over untouched areas, furthermore Poa angustifolia (Narrow-leaved Meadow-grass) and Alopecurus pratensis (Meadow Foxtail) in floodplain and along the dyke surrounding Szeged region represent a substantial proportion in the city. Along the urban lakesides Phragmites australis (Common Reed) is the most frequent Poaceae. For Populus genus, natural species of Populus alba (White Poplar) and Populus canescens (Grey Poplar) are the most frequent {{in the city and}} are characteristic in floodplain forests along the Tisza and Maros Rivers. In addition, cultivated poplars such as I- 273 Poplar and Populus x euroamericana (Canadian Poplar) and its variants are frequently planted in urban parklands, public places, as well as along roads in peripheries. Urtica genus with its only species of Urtica dioica (Common Nettle) in Szeged region is prevailing in the floodplain forest underwood of the Tisza and Maros Rivers, road- and channel-sides and in locust-tree plantations around the city. Urtica also occurs in neglected grassy lands of the city area (De√°k 2010).|$|E
