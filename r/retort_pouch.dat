5000|$|A <b>retort</b> <b>pouch</b> is {{constructed}} from a flexible metal-plastic laminate that {{is able to}} withstand the thermal processing used for sterilization. The food is first prepared, either raw or cooked, and then sealed into the <b>retort</b> <b>pouch.</b> The pouch is then heated to 240-250°F (116-121°C) for several minutes under high pressure inside a retort or autoclave machine. The food inside is cooked {{in a similar way}} to pressure cooking. This process reliably kills all commonly occurring microorganisms (particularly Clostridium botulinum), preventing it from spoiling. The packaging process is very similar to canning, except that the package itself is flexible. The lamination structure does not allow permeation of gases from outside into the pouch. The <b>retort</b> <b>pouch</b> construction varies from one application to another, as a liquid product needs different barrier properties than a dry product, and similarly an acidic product needs different chemical resistance than a basic product. Some different plastic layers used in retort pouches include: ...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 41 - 44) The {{ascorbic acid}} content of green beans processed in <b>retort</b> <b>pouches</b> was {{compared with that}} of green beans processed in metal cans. Measurements were taken before and after processing to study the effects of processing on ascorbic acid retention. Measurements were taken also at intervals following processing to observe the effects of storage on ascorbic acid retention. Green beans processed in metal cans retained a higher percentage of ascorbic acid during processing than green beans processed in <b>retort</b> <b>pouches.</b> During storage the percentage retention of ascorbic acid was at so higher for canned green beans than pouched green beans.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of different types of packaging on antioxidant activity of heat processed tomato salsa with herbs. Tomato salsa was standardized, filled hot in glass jars, cans and <b>retort</b> <b>pouches</b> then heat processed. Samples were analyzed for Lycopene, β-carotene, Total phenolics, flavonoids, Ascorbic acid and antioxidant activity, for four months of storage at both ambient (28 - 35 ˚C) and refrigerated (4 - 10 ˚C) temperatures. Antioxidant activity of the packed samples was analyzed using DPPH (di phenyl picryl hydrazyl) method. Effect of packaging and storage on antioxidant activity found to be significant (P≤ 0. 05) on % radical scavenging activity of the product at both temperatures. Canned product showed 86 - 79 % radical scavenging activity, where glass jars (refrigeration temperatures) showed 90 - 79 % activity during four months of storage. Product in <b>retort</b> <b>pouches</b> found to have less antioxidant activity (82 - 71 %). Sample in glass jars (refrigeration temperature) showed maximum antioxidant activity among all the samples initially and also during storage...|$|R
50|$|The EPa ration of the Bundeswehr is {{supplied}} in two types, rations 1 to 5 are packaged in a grey cardboard {{box with the}} meals packaged in sealed heavy duty foil trays which may be heated by immersing in hot water. The trays are opened using a knife or other sharp implement. Rations 6 to 19 are packaged in a resealable carry pouch, which is NATO Olive, desert brown or transparent.

5000|$|The IMPs {{appeared}} in the Canadian Forces in the 1980s, replacing early canned rations (Individual Ration Pack (IRP), Canadian Army Mess Tin Ration, Compo rations). The main menu items of the IMP are [...] "boil in a bag" [...] (known as a [...] "retort pouch") and require less preparation time and equipment than the previous canned rations. Another stated advantage is that preparation using <b>retort</b> <b>pouches</b> can be done using less heat, reducing {{the impact on the}} taste of the food.|$|R
5000|$|Utilising {{the plastic}} <b>retort</b> <b>pouch</b> over these other forms, {{particularly}} for delicate {{foods such as}} smoked salmon. T.D. Durance and L.S. Collins found that [...] "processing of late-run chum salmon in retortable pouches resulted in 48% reduction in processing time" [...] for a given level of lethality to microorganisms, a clear advantage over traditional canning techniques.|$|E
50|$|This {{multi-layer}} structure {{prevents the}} <b>retort</b> <b>pouch</b> from being recycled into other retort pouches or food packaging. However, the material can be recycled into an aluminized resin or up-cycled into textile materials. The {{weight of a}} pouch is less than regular cans or bottles, and the energy required to produce each pouch is less than competing packaging from metals, paper, and glass.|$|E
5000|$|Pouched {{food can}} be eaten without heating, {{or it can}} be heated quickly by placing the pouch in boiling water for a few minutes. Frozen foods, in contrast, require heating for about half an hour. Thus, less energy is {{required}} for heating a <b>retort</b> <b>pouch.</b> Pouched food can also be heated in a microwave oven simply by removing it from the pouch before heating.|$|E
5000|$|The Chinese People's Liberation Army has {{recently}} {{introduced a new}} set of rations consisting of pre-packaged single-person meals sealed in hard plastic <b>retort</b> <b>pouches.</b> The Chinese military rations are of two types: Instant Meal Individual (three-item menu) and Self-Heating Individual (twelve-item menu). A typical Chinese breakfast ration contains roughly [...] and includes a compressed food packet, an energy bar, an egg roll with pork, pickled mustard tuber, and a powdered beverage pack.

50|$|New Zealand issues an Operational Ration Pack {{designed}} to provide one soldier with three complete meals. Based around two ready-to-eat <b>retort</b> <b>pouches</b> (e.g. Beef and Vegetable stew, Chicken Curry), the ORP comes in 4 menus. Also included are: Anzac biscuits, chocolate bars, URC fruit grains, muesli bars, instant soup powder, instant noodles, muesli cereal, a tube of condensed milk, hard crackers, tinned cheese, cocoa powder, instant coffee, tea bags, instant sport drink powder, sugar, salt, pepper, glucose sweets, Marmite, jam, ketchup, onion flakes, waterproofed matches, a resealable plastic bag, and a menu sheet.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, a {{new version}} of the LRP ration called the LRP-I (Food Packet, Long-Range Patrol - Improved) was created. It was an 11 oz ration that came in a brown plastic <b>retort</b> <b>pouch</b> that allowed the user to {{reconstitute}} and cook the ration directly in the pouch. This was an improvement over the earlier LRP packet, which had to be boiled or soaked in a canteen cup or other cookware.|$|E
50|$|Canada {{provides}} each soldier with {{a complete}} pre-cooked meal known as the IMP (Individual Meal Pack), packaged inside a heavy-duty folding paper bag. There are 5 breakfast menus, 6 lunch menus, and 6 supper menus. Canadian rations provide generous portions and contain {{a large number of}} commercially available items. Like the US ration, the main meal is precooked and ready-to-eat, packed in heavy-duty plastic-foil retort pouches boxed with cardboard. Typically, the ration contains a meal item (beans and wiener sausages, scalloped potatoes with ham, smoked salmon fillet, macaroni and cheese, cheese omelette with mushrooms, shepherd's pie, etc.), wet-packed (sliced or mashed) fruit in a boxed <b>retort</b> <b>pouch,</b> and depending on the meal a combination of instant soup or cereal, fruit drink crystals, jam or cheese spread, peanut butter, honey, crackers, bread (bun) compressed into a <b>retort</b> <b>pouch,</b> coffee and tea, sugar, commercially available chocolate bars and hard candy, a long plastic spoon, paper towels and wet wipes. Canada also makes limited use of a Light Meal Pack containing dried meat or cheese, dried fruit, a granola bar, a breakfast cereal square, a chocolate bar, hard candy, hot cocoa mix, tea, and two pouches of instant fruit drink. Canadian ration packs also contain a book of cardboard matches.|$|E
50|$|Lithuanian {{field rations}} {{are based on}} the US Army's MRE - they come in 10 menus packed in a dark green plastic bag, and besides the main meal in a <b>retort</b> <b>pouch</b> they also include two small dark {{chocolate}} bars, honey or jam, four hard-tack biscuits, a handful of almonds or hazelnuts, instant drink mix, tea or coffee, sugar, an antiseptic wipe, matches, solid fuel tablets, a flat disposable stove, a flameless heater (similar to the US one) and a cable-tie used to seal waste packaging back into the outer bag after use.|$|E
5000|$|For IMPs, {{the main}} entrée and the dessert portion are {{contained}} in <b>retort</b> <b>pouches,</b> which are then packaged in cardboard boxes. These cardboard boxes are positioned inside the IMP package on the outer sides, sandwiching the other contents, so the IMP itself looks like it is entirely contained within a cardboard box inside the outer foil-lined paper bag. IMPs are usually [...] "stripped" [...] before field use by removing the cumbersome packaging and discarding extraneous elements individual soldiers {{do not wish to}} carry with them, such as the cardboard boxes containing the main entrée and dessert, and any condiments that an individual soldier may not personally use.|$|R
50|$|The UK also fields {{a larger}} pack of rations {{intended}} to feed ten soldiers for 24 hours from centralised but basic preparation; generally similar in content {{to the single}} issue ORP but tending to contain larger quantities of food in cylindrical tin cans to be divided up on preparation, rather than individual <b>retort</b> <b>pouches</b> or packets. Even dry materials like sugar or biscuits are often packed in these cans. They contain ingredients for baking bread and tinned food, including vegetables, corned beef and sausages in lard. Also included are chocolate, pre-cooked chicken or beef in gravy and soya mince. Ten boxed one-man ORPs are supplied in larger boxes identical in shape to the single ten-man pack.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Brunei Army uses a 24-hour ration pack that {{provides}} a soldier with an entire day's supply of food, plus {{a limited number of}} health and hygiene items. Maximum use is made of plastic-foil laminate pouches, and most items can be eaten without further preparation. Currently, four menus are fielded, and all menus are compatible with Muslim dietary restrictions. Example Menu (F): 5 x 170-gram <b>retort</b> <b>pouches</b> (Biriani Chicken, Mutton Curry, Sardines in Tomato Sauce, Bubur Jagong/ Corn Porridge, Pineapple Pajeri); plus individual servings of pineapple jam, instant coffee, teabags, sugar, salt, pepper, steminder powder, hot chili sauce, MSG, a multivitamin energy tablet, tissue paper, scouring pad with soap, and matches.|$|R
