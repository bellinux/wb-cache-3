5|$|RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a {{specialized}} class of polymerases that copy {{the sequence of}} an RNA strand into DNA. They include <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase,</b> which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses, and telomerase, which {{is required for the}} replication of telomeres. For example, HIV <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication. Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.|$|E
5|$|As {{an example}} of viral classification, the chicken pox virus, {{varicella}} zoster (VZV), belongs to the order Herpesvirales, family Herpesviridae, subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, and genus Varicellovirus. VZV is in Group I of the Baltimore Classification {{because it is a}} dsDNA virus that does not use <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> liberates the {{single-stranded}} (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E
40|$|Using {{synthetic}} oligonucleotides {{corresponding to}} the amino acid sequences best conserved among retroviral <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases,</b> we developed a rapid method to detect cloned DNA fragments with the genes for <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases.</b> By this technique followed by nucleotide sequence determination, nucleotide sequences coding for reverse transcriptase-like enzymes were identified in two Drosophila retrotransposons, gypsy and 412. Our sequence analysis suggested that {{there are at least}} two major groups of retrotransposons in Drosophila with respect to putative <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> and both gypsy and 412 belong to a category of retrotransposons which have putative <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> very similar in amino acid sequence to the counterpart of Moloney murine leukaemia virus, a typical mammalian retrovirus...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the specific minus-strand transfer reactions that occur after the synthesis of minus strong-stop DNA and nonspecific strand switching on homopolymeric poly(rA) templates with different types of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases.</b> Three different types of <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> can be isolated from virions of RSV: heterodimeric αβ and homodimeric α and β. The mechanism of minus-strand transfer was examined using a model primer-template substrate corresponding to the 5 ′- and 3 ′-terminal RNA regions of the RSV genome. The results reveal that the RNase H activity of RSV <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> is required for minus-strand transfer. Less than 2 % of strand transfer of the extended product is detectable with RNase H-deficient enzymes. We could show that the α homodimer lacking the integrase domain can perform strand transfer almost as efficiently as the αβ and αPol heterodimers. In contrast, the activities of β and Pol for minus-strand transfer are reduced. Furthermore, a two- to fivefold increase in minus-strand transfer activities was observed {{in the presence of}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nucleocapsid protein...|$|R
25|$|The protein {{consists}} of four conserved domains (RNA-Binding Domain (TRBD), fingers, palm and thumb), organized into a ring configuration that shares common features with retroviral <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases,</b> viral RNA polymerases and bacteriophage B-family DNA polymerases.|$|R
5|$|After HIV has {{bound to}} the target cell, the HIV RNA and various enzymes, {{including}} <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase,</b> integrase, ribonuclease, and protease, are injected into the cell. During the microtubule-based transport to the nucleus, the viral single-strand RNA genome is transcribed into double-strand DNA, which is then integrated into a host chromosome.|$|E
5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> {{acts as a}} repair process to deal with breaks in the ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, retroviruses and <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> were discovered, showing {{for the first}} time that enzymes could copy RNA into DNA (the {{opposite}} of the usual route for transmission of genetic information). For this work, David Baltimore, Renato Dulbecco and Howard Temin were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1975.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} retroviruses, the MLVs {{replicate}} their genomes with relatively low fidelity. Thus, divergent viral sequences {{may be found}} in a single host organism. MLV <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> are thought to have a slightly higher fidelity than the HIV-1 RT.|$|R
25|$|Many viruses use a single-subunit DNA-dependent RNAP that is {{structurally}} and mechanistically {{related to}} the single-subunit RNAP of eukaryotic chloroplasts and mitochondria and, more distantly, to DNA polymerases and <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases.</b> Perhaps the most widely studied such single-subunit RNAP is bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase.|$|R
40|$|RNases H are nucleases that cleave {{ribonucleotides}} in RNA/DNA hybrid duplexes. Two {{classes of}} these enzymes {{have been described}} — RNases H 1 and RNases H 2. The first requires a stretch of at least four ribonucleotides in the hybrid for the cleavage to occur. In addition to its cellular form it also exists as a domain of <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> — enzymes converting single-stranded RNA to double-stranded DNA. <b>Reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> participate proliferation of retrotransposons and retroviruses such as HIV and RNase H activity is essential for this process. The second type is RNase H 2 which specifically cleaves single ribonucleotides embedded in the DNA. Such single ribonucleotides are mistakenly incorporated by DNA polymerases and lead to genome instability. Therefore, ribonucleotide excision by RNase H 2 protects the genomic DNA...|$|R
5|$|HIV {{differs from}} many viruses {{in that it}} has very high genetic variability. This {{diversity}} {{is a result of}} its fast replication cycle, with the generation of about 1010 virions every day, coupled with a high mutation rate of approximately 3 x 10−5 per nucleotide base per cycle of replication and recombinogenic properties of <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses: These have ssRNA (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or dsDNA (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) {{in their}} particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA {{intermediate}} to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase,</b> or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, {{to carry out}} the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by reverse transcription into the host genome as a provirus {{as a part of the}} replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus. They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> enzyme, e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine. An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes Hepatitis B virus.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> were {{discovered}} by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in RSV virions and independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses: R-MLV and again RSV. For their achievements, both shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco).|$|R
40|$|AbstractTwo 2 ′-deoxynucleoside 5 ′-α-methylenephosphonyl-β,γ-diphosphates were synthesized. They were {{incorporated}} into the DNA chain by DNA polymerase α from human placenta.

5|$|Enzymes serve a {{wide variety}} of {{functions}} inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal transduction and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases. They also generate movement, with myosin hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies. Viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the HIV integrase and <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase,</b> or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus neuraminidase.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed {{for the development of}} the virion such as <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase,</b> proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{also contains}} a sugar-binding protein, or lectin, that has affinity for the sugars xylose and melibiose. The lectin is mitogenic—that is, it can stimulate cells {{to begin the process}} of cell division, resulting in mitosis. Further, the lectin has antiviral properties: it inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus enzyme <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase.</b> Other studies suggest that B.edulis also has antiviral activity against Vaccinia virus and tobacco mosaic virus grown in culture. Antiviral compounds from mushrooms are a subject of interest in biomedical research for their potential to advance the knowledge of viral replication, and as new drugs in the treatment of viral disease.|$|E
40|$|The rules {{defining}} the AspAsp domain of RNAdependent polymerases deduced by Argos (1988) {{were tested in}} a set of 53 putative <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> (RTs) sequences. Since it was found that some of these rules are not followed by RTs coded by bacteria, group II introns, and nonLTR retrotransposons, we present here a more strict definition of the AspAsp domain...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} allows deleterious transposable {{elements to}} proliferate in populations, whereas {{the loss of}} sex, by preventing their spread, has been predicted eventually {{to result in a}} population free of such elements [Hickey, D. A. (1982) Genetics 101, 519 – 531]. We tested this expectation by screening representatives of a majority of animal phyla for LINE-like and gypsy-like <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> and mariner/Tc 1 -like transposases. All species tested positive for <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> except rotifers of the class Bdelloidea, the largest eukaryotic taxon in which males, hermaphrodites, and meiosis are unknown and for which ancient asexuality is supported by molecular genetic evidence. Mariner-like transposases are distributed sporadically among species and are present in bdelloid rotifers. The remarkable lack of LINE-like and gypsy-like retrotransposons in bdelloids and their ubiquitous presence in other taxa support the view that eukaryotic retrotransposons are sexually transmitted nuclear parasites and that bdelloid rotifers evolved asexually...|$|R
50|$|The primase used by archaea and eukaryotes, in contrast, {{contains}} a highly derived {{version of the}} RNA recognition motif (RRM). This primase is structurally similar to many viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases,</b> cyclic nucleotide generating cyclases and DNA polymerases of the A/B/Y families {{that are involved in}} DNA replication and repair. In eukaryotic replication, the primase forms a complex with Pol α.|$|R
5|$|Some {{nucleic acids}} of RNA viruses {{function}} directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses. In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses {{rely on the}} cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called negative-sense RNA viruses. In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production {{is similar to that}} of the cell. The species of viruses called retroviruses behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase.</b> This DNA is then incorporated into the host's own DNA, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century was the golden age of virus {{discovery}} and most of the over 2,000 recognised species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years. In 1957, equine arterivirus and the cause of Bovine virus diarrhoea (a pestivirus) were discovered. In 1963, the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg, and in 1965, Howard Temin described the first retrovirus. <b>Reverse</b> <b>transcriptase,</b> the enzyme that retroviruses use to make DNA copies of their RNA, was first described in 1970, independently by Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore. In 1983 Luc Montagnier's team at the Pasteur Institute in France, first isolated the retrovirus now called HIV. In 1989 Michael Houghton's team at Chiron Corporation discovered Hepatitis C.|$|E
5|$|This complex {{scenario}} {{leads to}} the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient {{in the course of}} one day. This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase,</b> by jumping {{back and forth between the}} two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral DNA sequence that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes. This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.|$|E

Our analyses revealed that RTs predominate large-size fraction metagenomes (5 [*]μm), where they reached a maximum of 13. 5...|$|R
25|$|Given that DNA and RNA polymerases both {{carry out}} template-dependent {{nucleotide}} polymerization, {{it might be}} expected that {{the two types of}} enzymes would be structurally related, but they are not. They seem to have arisen independently twice during the early evolution of cells: one lineage led to the modern DNA polymerases and <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases,</b> as well as to a few single-subunit RNA polymerases from viruses; the other lineage formed all of the modern cellular RNA polymerases.|$|R

5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E
25|$|An {{improved}} {{knowledge of}} the action of <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> has led to better nucleoside analogues to treat HIV infections. One of these drugs, lamivudine, has been approved to treat hepatitis B, which uses <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> {{as part of its}} replication process. Researchers have gone further and developed inhibitors that do not look like nucleosides, but can still block <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase.</b>|$|E

By biochemical and immunological methods, the enzyme can be clearly distinguished from the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> of the known chicken RNA tumor viruses and therefore {{seems to be a}} member of a so far unknown class of chicken polymerases...|$|R
40|$|Group II introns {{are widely}} {{believed}} to have been ancestors of spliceosomal introns, yet little is known about their own evolutionary history. In order to address the evolution of mobile group II introns, we have compiled 71 open reading frames (ORFs) related to group II intron <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> and subjected their derived amino acid sequences to phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree was rooted with <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> (RTs) of non-long terminal repeat retroelements, and the inferred phylogeny reveals two major clusters which we term the mitochondrial and chloroplast-like lineages. Bacterial ORFs are mainly positioned at the bases of the two lineages but with weak bootstrap support. The data give an overview of an apparently high degree of horizontal transfer of group II intron ORFs, mostly among related organisms but also between organelles and bacteria. The Zn domain (nuclease) and YADD motif (RT active site) were lost multiple times during evolution. Differences in domain structures suggest that the oldest ORFs were concise, while the ORF in the mitochondrial lineage subsequently expanded in three locations. The data are consistent with a bacterial origin for mobile group II introns...|$|R
