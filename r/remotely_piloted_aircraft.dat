40|$|This paper {{presents}} an early exploration and preliminary {{results on the}} use of <b>Remotely</b> <b>Piloted</b> <b>Aircrafts</b> (RPA) as 5 G points of presence. The use of RPAs in the 5 G arena would enable a cost-effective deployment of functions over mobile nodes that could be integrated on demand into the programmable and unified 5 G infrastructure, enhancing the capacity of the network to flexibly adapt to the particular service requirements in a geographical area. As a first step, we evaluate the feasibility and the cost, in terms of energy consumption, of using virtualisation techniques over resource-constrained aerial vehicle platforms, as a fundamental software technology in the evolution towards 5 G. We complement this evaluation presenting a proof-of-concept that considers the use of these platforms to enable real-time 5 G communications in emergency cases.

On March 5, 1999, The ALTUS II maintained flight at or above 55,000 feet for three hours, reaching a maximum density altitude of 57,300 feet during the mission.|$|E
25|$|The {{target market}} is the U.S. Air National Guard and foreign nations that cannot afford the F-35, but want an {{aircraft}} to perform ISR and light attack missions better than turboprop planes. Buying and sustaining the Scorpion would cost less than A-10 or F-16 upgrades. For air patrol, the Scorpion requires radar and the capability of supersonic flight, similar to the unsuccessful 1980s-era Northrop F-20 Tigershark. The market for light fixed-wing attack jets had declined in the 1980s as richer countries opted for more capable aircraft and poorer countries pursued turboprops and attack helicopters. It is uncertain if the Scorpion will be cheaper or outperform turboprops or <b>remotely</b> <b>piloted</b> <b>aircraft</b> (RPA) in terms of range, endurance, low-altitude performance, and sensors.|$|E

40|$|The {{target of}} this study is analyse the {{operational}} requirement of UAV/RPAS activities in special conditionsThis study analyses and determines the operational requirements for unmanned aerial vehicles and <b>remotely</b> <b>piloted</b> <b>aircrafts</b> when operating in congested and hostile areas. In order to do so, a study of present regulatory framework from different countries is done and proposals published by regulating authorities from Europe and America as well, concluding this initial approach to unmanned aerial vehicle’s regulations with a benchmark of best practices. Afterwards, a risk analysis and a safe study are done by identifying potential risks, taking into account all possible situations and scenarios that can be produced during an operation in a congested area. Once the risks are adequately identified, an evaluation of them is performed, obtaining as a result a safety level which is acceptable or unacceptable in order to ensure the integrity of people on ground, and consequently developing the operation or not. Finally, for those operations associated to a risk that result in an unacceptable safety level, mitigation measures are proposed to reduce the likelihood of hazard happening and the severity of the consequences. It may be noted that these mitigation measures consist in adding technology to unmanned aircraft systems and establishing operational procedures...|$|R
40|$|<b>Remotely</b> <b>piloted</b> <b>aircrafts</b> (RPAs or “drones”) {{have become}} {{important}} tools in military surveillance and combat, border protection, police and disaster management. In particular, {{the use of}} weaponized RPAs {{has led to a}} discussion on the ethical, strategic and legal implications of using such systems in warfare. In this context, studies suggest that RPA pilots experience similar exposure to post-traumatic stress, depression and anxiety disorders compared to fighter pilots, although the flight and combat experiences are completely different. In order to investigate this phenomenon, we created an experiment that intends to measure the “moral stress” RPA pilots may experience when the operation of such systems leads to human casualties. “Moral stress” refers to the possibility that deciding upon moral dilemmas may not only cause physiological stress, but may also lead to (unconscious) changes in the evaluation of values and reasons that are relevant to problem solving. The experiment includes an RPA simulation based on a game engine and novel measurement tools to assess moral reasoning. In this contribution, we outline the design of the experiment and the results of pretests that demonstrate the sensitivity of our measures. We close by arguing for the need of such studies to better understand novel forms of human-computer interaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to design and test key components of a sensor to be used on <b>remotely</b> <b>piloted</b> vehicles, <b>aircraft,</b> or satellites {{for the detection of}} moving vehicles in cluttered backgrounds. The proposed sensor uses modern large-array focal planes to provide multiple infrared observations of moving targets and capable on-board computers to integrate multiple observations to detect moving targets in background clutter. This combination reduces the size, weight, and cost of the sensor to levels that can be flown on many small unmanned platforms. This effort selected the actual components, integrated them into a test bed, tested the performance of the sensor against realistic generated scenes, and designed a proof-of-concept prototype...|$|R

40|$|Results of {{the crash}} test of a <b>remotely</b> <b>piloted</b> {{transport}} <b>aircraft</b> instrumented to measure a NASA energy-absorbing transport seat are given.

Therefore, dummies in the standard and EA-seat responded approximately the same. All longitudinal accelerations were quite low for the primary impact with very low forces measured in the lap belts. The vertical (spineward) acceleration levels measured in the dummies were also relatively low and very survivable from an impact tolerance standpoint.

40|$|Radar {{systems are}} widely {{employed}} for surveillance of wide and remote areas, more generally, for remote sensing purposes. The recent advent of drones, {{together with their}} spreading across multiple fields, gives the opportunity to exploit the radar sensor on board of these unmanned aerial platforms. Nevertheless, whereas drone radars are currently available for military applications, their employment in the civilian domain is still limited. The present research focuses on design, prototyping and testing of an agile, low-cost, mini-radar system, to be carried on board of <b>Remotely</b> <b>Piloted</b> <b>Aircrafts</b> (RPAs) or tethered aerostats. In particular, the paper faces the challenge to integrate the in house developed radar sensor with a low-cost navigation board, {{which is used to}} estimate attitude and positioning data. In fact, a suitable synchronization between radar and navigation data is essential to properly reconstruct the radar picture whenever the platform is moving or the radar is scanning different azimuthal sectors. The integrated radar system is presented in terms of the adopted solutions for its design, manufacturing and implemented processing. The approach identified for the integration of radar and navigation unit is presented. Preliminary results, relative to tests conducted in pre-operational conditions, are provided and exploited to assert the suitable consistency of the obtained radar pictures. From the results, an high consistency between the radar images and the picture of the current environment emerges; finally the comparison of radar images obtained in different scans shows the stability of the platform.
