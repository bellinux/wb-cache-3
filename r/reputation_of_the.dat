5|$|David Margoliouth (professor 1889–1937) {{taught the}} {{syllabus}} {{for the final}} examinations in lectures over two years, forcing some students to tackle the more difficult texts {{in their first year}} of study. Successive professors had few students until after the Second World War, when numbers increased because of the <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> then professor, Gibb, and because some British students became interested in Arabic culture while serving in the Middle East during the war. Julia Bray, the Laudian Professor , was appointed in 2012 and is the first woman to hold the position. She is a member of Oxford's Faculty of Oriental Studies, based at the Oriental Institute.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the diverse}} range of {{accounting}} services and recent corporate collapses, attention has been drawn to ethical standards accepted within the accounting profession. These collapses {{have resulted in a}} widespread disregard for the <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accounting profession. To combat the criticism and prevent fraudulent accounting, various accounting organizations and governments have developed regulations and remedies for improved ethics among the accounting profession.|$|E
5|$|However, {{safety issues}} {{continue}} to be a persistent problem in Indonesian aviation. Several accidents have given Indonesia's air transport system the <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> least safe in the world. Indonesian aviation faces numerous challenges, including poorly maintained, outdated, and often overwhelmed infrastructure, the factor of human error, bad weather, haze problems caused by plantation fires, and volcanic ash spewed by numerous area volcanoes that disrupts air transportation.|$|E

5|$|However, {{there were}} exceptions; in the 7th century a Merovingian kingdom still {{retained}} {{at least one}} active Roman horse breeding centre. The Spanish also retained many quality horses, {{in part due to}} the historic <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region as a horse-breeding land, and partially due to the cultural influences related to the Islamic conquest of the Iberian peninsula between the 8th and 15th centuries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years at Croydon, girls tended to be {{enrolled}} at an older age, typically over fourteen. It was apparent that despite Marden's insistence, many parents viewed the College as a finishing school. As today, {{it was not a}} requirement for students to be Presbyterians, and early school records indicate {{there were a number of}} Roman Catholic and Jewish students. By 1900 the <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school had spread, and pupils were starting to come from a wider geographic area, including New Caledonia, Fiji, New Zealand, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia.|$|E
5|$|More recent performances, led by {{conductors}} Pierre Boulez, Edo de Waart and Sixten Ehrling, {{have been}} acknowledged {{to show the}} music in a more positive light. Nevertheless, the overall <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music remains mixed. Some critics, including composer John Adams, have remained critical {{of the work and}} considered Copland's use of serial techniques detrimental to his later music. Others, which include critics Michael Andrews and Peter Davis, have seen Connotations as proof of Copland's continued growth and inventiveness as a composer while not downplaying the work's melodic and harmonic harshness and potential difficulty overall for listeners.|$|E
50|$|After a {{protracted}} development period, the Swift entered service as an interceptor aircraft with the RAF in 1954. However, {{due to a}} spate of accidents incurred by the type, the Swift was grounded for a time, and experienced a relatively brief service life. These issues with the Swift led to a public scandal surrounding the aircraft, harming <b>the</b> <b>reputations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British government, the RAF, and the aircraft industry.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-2010s, with {{extensive}} police patrols and redevelopment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area, violent crimes shifted from Whalley south to Newton, which {{has taken over}} <b>the</b> area's <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> being <b>the</b> most dangerous part of Surrey.|$|R
50|$|Clovis Maksoud’s {{writings}} and pan-Arab ideals {{led to his}} nomination in 1961 as Ambassador <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arab League to India and Southeast Asia, where he had <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> being <b>the</b> most influential foreign diplomat.|$|R
5|$|Several suicides also darkened the <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ritz in {{the postwar}} years, {{including}} that of horse trainer Peter Beatty from the sixth floor window in October 1949, and that of French gangster Baron Pierre de Laitre, who strangled love interest Eileen Hill to death in his second floor room in March 1953 when she refused to marry him, before killing himself by stuffing a silk sock down his throat.|$|E
5|$|The British Government {{called on}} Keynes's {{expertise}} during the First World War. While {{he did not}} formally re-join the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government's request {{a few days before}} hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of specie payments – the convertibility of banknotes into gold – but with Keynes's help the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Lloyd George) was persuaded {{that this would be a}} bad idea, as it would hurt the future <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city if payments were suspended before it was absolutely necessary.|$|E
5|$|The Carolingian reign saw {{periods of}} {{prosperity}} for the Champagne region beginning with Charlemagne's encouragement {{for the area}} to start planting vines and continuing with the coronation of his son Louis the Pious at Reims. The tradition of crowning kings at Reims contributed to the <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wines that came from this area. The Counts of Champagne ruled the area as an independent county from 950 to 1316. In 1314, the last Count of Champagne assumed the throne as King Louis X of France and the region {{became part of the}} Crown territories.|$|E

It also found that <b>the</b> perpetrators <b>of</b> this violence had been protected by their religious superiors, primarily out of self-interest to maintain <b>the</b> <b>reputations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institutions concerned. 42 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 43 conclusions refer to the Industrial Schools.|$|R
50|$|Andrey Rostovtsev, {{physicist}} and founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “Dissernet” project, supports Burmatov’s claims.

5|$|The scandal {{proved an}} embarrassment to the <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy, then still the world's largest, and it was satirised {{at home and abroad}} through editorials, cartoons, and even a comic jazz oratorio {{composed}} by Erwin Schulhoff. One consequence of the damaging affair was an undertaking from the Admiralty to review the means by which naval officers might bring complaints against the conduct of their superiors.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{warships}} of Antiquity, Byzantine and Arab ships did not feature rams, and {{the primary}} means of ship-to-ship combat were boarding actions and missile fire, {{as well as the}} use of inflammable materials such as Greek fire. Despite the fearsome <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter, it was only effective under certain circumstances, and not the decisive anti-ship weapon that the ram had been in the hands of experienced crews.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevailing}} design philosophy for A Realm Reborn was {{to simultaneously}} appeal to hardcore MMORPG players while {{reaching out to}} new players and Final Fantasy fans who had never experienced the genre before. As a consequence, Yoshida held optimizing gameplay for controllers as a top priority. To streamline development, he made about 400 fundamental design decisions which eliminated time lost to getting approvals, {{with a focus on}} implementing standard features of the genre first. The new workflow pipeline was tested using updates to the original game and applied to development of A Realm Reborn. The continuing operations of the original release also provided a valuable testing ground for new features that would be carried into the relaunch. Throughout this process, Yoshida emphasized that communication with players and restoring their trust was key, even admitting that sales were secondary compared to redeeming the <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series. Live streaming conversations between the development team and fans, such as the Letters from the Producer LIVE events, became a major element of Yoshida's player outreach strategy.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} voting {{system that is}} based on an {{iterative}} method that assigns a reputation to n + m items, n objects and in raters, applying some filter to the votes. Each rater evaluates a subset of objects leading to an n x m rating matrix with a given sparsity pattern. From this rating matrix a formula is defined for <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> raters and objects. We propose a natural and intuitive nonlinear formula and also provide an iterative algorithm that linearly converges to <b>the</b> unique vector <b>of</b> <b>reputations</b> and this for any rating matrix. In contrast to classical outliers detection, no evaluation is discarded in this method but each one is taken into account with different weights for <b>the</b> <b>reputations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> objects. <b>The</b> complexity <b>of</b> one iteration step is linear in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> evaluations, making our algorithm efficient for large data set.

25|$|Clipper {{ships were}} the fastest sailing ships {{available}} in the 1850s, and Howard I. Chapelle asserts in The Search for Speed Under Sail that Sunny South had <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> being <b>the</b> fastest slaver sailing out of Havana.|$|R
5|$|As the <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mars Works grew, so too did {{the demand}} for its products. After a few years the Mars Works began {{exporting}} its engines inland. Oliver Evans's son George was the first such order, having moved to Pittsburgh in 1809 to operate the Pittsburgh Steam Flour Mill. George and the mill were highly successful, and generated {{a great deal of}} interest in Evans's engines across the interior. However exporting engines to western Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical perspective. In 1811 Evans and George, as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens, founded the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company, which in addition to engines would, like the Mars Works, produce heavy machinery and castings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity, the Pittsburgh works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork, as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like hinges and fittings.|$|E
5|$|Built {{around long}} narrow yards, {{as well as}} serving food and drink and {{providing}} lodgings, these coaching inns also served as temporary warehouses, auction rooms and gambling halls for travellers {{doing business in the}} market. The best known was the Angel, parts of which dated to the 15thcentury. As well as providing the other functions of the Norwich inns, its yard also served as a popular theatre and venue for other performers. (Despite its significance as a city, Norwich did not have a dedicated theatre until 1758.) However, in 1699 part of the building collapsed during a performance by Thomas Doggett's troupe of players, killing a woman and injuring many of the audience. The <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Angel was severely damaged, and although still used for small scale entertainments such as puppet shows, it was never again used for full scale theatrical performances.|$|E
5|$|During {{the letters}} scandal, Charlotte lost her diary which {{contained}} both family secrets and critical thoughts on {{various members of}} her family; the diary was eventually given to Wilhelm, who never forgave her for its contents. Bernhard was transferred to a regiment in the quiet town of Breslau, effectively exiling him and his wife. As controller of Charlotte's allowance, Wilhelm also limited their ability to travel outside of the country unless {{they were willing to}} go without royal honours. In 1896, Dona accused Charlotte of engaging in an affair with Karl-August Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, a court official. Charlotte fiercely denied the allegations. Bernhard defended his wife and criticised the Hohenzollerns for attempting to keep every Prussian princess {{under the control of the}} family. Bernhard considered resigning his army position and leaving with his wife for Meiningen, though the dispute eventually resolved itself when von Diersburg returned to court with his wife. The scandal was considered to have seriously damaged the <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monarchy.|$|E

5|$|From the mid-1940s {{through the}} 1960s, the Triangle was the {{commercial}} and cultural heart of Jerusalem, with many upscale shops and restaurants operated by German-Jewish immigrant businessmen that appealed to an affluent clientele. Following the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 {{and the expansion of}} the city away from the downtown core, the commercial viability of the Triangle declined. The area was revitalized by the conversion of Ben Yehuda Street and the interior streets of the Triangle to an open-air pedestrian mall in 1982. Over the next two decades, outdoor cafes and souvenir shops moved in, cementing the <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Triangle as a popular shopping and entertainment venue for tourists and young Israelis.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Chadwick {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} become the Master of Gonville and Caius College. The job was prestigious but ill-defined; the Master was the titular head of the College, but authority actually resided in a council of 13 fellows, of whom one was the Master. As Master, Chadwick strove to improve the academic <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> college. He {{increased the number of}} research fellowships from 31 to 49, and sought to bring talent into the college. This involved controversial decisions, such as hiring in 1951 the Chinese biochemist Tien-chin Tsao and the Hungarian-born economist Peter Bauer. In {{what became known as the}} Peasants' Revolt, fellows led by Patrick Hadley voted an old friend of Chadwick's off the council and replaced him with Bauer. More friends of Chadwick's were removed over the following years, and he retired in November 1958. It was during his mastership that Francis Crick, a PhD student at Gonville and Caius College, and James Watson discovered the structure of DNA.|$|E
5|$|In 972 A.D., {{during the}} rule of Khottiga Amoghavarsha, the Paramara King Siyaka Harsha {{attacked}} the empire and plundered Manyakheta, {{the capital of the}} Rashtrakutas. This seriously undermined the <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rastrakuta Empire and consequently led to its downfall. The final decline was sudden as Tailapa II, a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta ruling from Tardavadi province in modern Bijapur district, declared himself independent by taking advantage of this defeat. Indra IV, the last emperor, committed Sallekhana (fasting unto death practised by Jain monks) at Shravanabelagola. With the fall of the Rashtrakutas, their feudatories and related clans in the Deccan and northern India declared independence. The Western Chalukyas annexed Manyakheta and made it their capital until 1015 and built an impressive empire in the Rashtrakuta heartland during the 11th century. The focus of dominance shifted to the Krishna River– Godavari River doab called Vengi. The former feudatories of the Rashtrakutas in western Deccan were brought under control of the Chalukyas, and the hitherto-suppressed Cholas of Tanjore became their arch enemies in the south.|$|E

25|$|The Knicks have {{a strong}} rivalry with the Chicago Bulls. The rivalry's most intense period was during the late 1980s and early 90s, when both teams were huge playoff contenders.
