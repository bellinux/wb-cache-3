5|$|Chapman {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{football}} managers in the modern sense of the word, taking full charge of the team, rather than letting board members pick the side. As well as his tactical innovations, he was also a strong believer in physical fitness in football – he instituted a strict training regime and the use of physiotherapists and masseurs. He encouraged his players to openly discuss tactics and the game, instituting weekly team meetings at his clubs, and encouraged them to socialise in extra-curricular activities such as golf. He wrote <b>regularly</b> <b>on</b> football for the Sunday Express newspaper, and a collection of his writings was published after his death in a book, entitled Herbert Chapman on Football.|$|E

Colonies of tens or hundreds, rarely thousands, of birds breed <b>regularly</b> <b>on</b> small coastal and subcoastal islands where food is seasonally or permanently available.

5|$|The Land of Gorch was a {{recurring}} skit {{that appeared in}} season one of the American comedy television program Saturday Night Live, featuring Jim Henson's Muppets. Prior to his work for children on Sesame Street, Henson had created puppetry work, including his show Sam and Friends, for adult audiences. His characters appeared <b>regularly</b> <b>on</b> the late-night comedy television programs, and The Ed Sullivan Show.

5|$|The {{programme}} {{has often}} been compared to the television panel game QI.

As a result, some critics consider the radio show to be a spin-off of the TV programme, and some have further ventured that The Museum of Curiosity {{is not as good}} as its forerunner. Most reviews of The Museum of Curiosity, however, are positive.|$|E
