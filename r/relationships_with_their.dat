5|$|Adding to Tony's {{complicated}} life is {{his relationship}} with his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), which is strained by his constant infidelity and her struggle to reconcile the reality of Tony's business (which she is often in denial of), with the affluent lifestyle and higher social status it brings her. Both have up-and-down <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> two children: the intelligent-but-rebellious Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), and underachiever A.J. (i.e., Anthony, Jr.) (Robert Iler), whose everyday teenage issues are further complicated by their eventual knowledge of their father's criminal activities and reputation.|$|E
40|$|This article {{looks at}} {{homeless}} individuals {{to see how}} they think their residential situation affects <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> non-homeless children. Using a survey of 75 homeless parents in Houston, Texas this analysis finds that homeless parents of non-homeless children believe that their living situation has a detrimental impact on <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> children. While many respondents felt that they had a good <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> children the chances of maintaining a good relationship were less for respondents with adult children than minor children. While a majority of respondents with children felt that finding housing stability would help <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> children, those <b>with</b> minority children were more optimistic that finding a permanent home would help them improve their parent-child <b>relationship</b> than those <b>with</b> older children...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the current trade shortage in Australian industry {{from the perspective of}} fewer young people entering the trades. We investigated the extent to which certain variables (<b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> boss/supervisor; <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> co-workers; extrinsic motivation within the compensation subscale; the use of emotion-focused coping styles rather than problem-focused styles; and apprentices' work expectations) could predict their intention to quit or stay in the job. Of the five predictors, only two (<b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> boss/supervisor and/or <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> co-workers) were found {{to have the ability to}} significantly predict intention to quit. Comparisons between Queensland and Victorian participants led to the conclusion that an apprentice's choice to stay in or leave their trade was individually specific, and was most likely not based solely on one explicit factor, but on a range of work-related factors, which they, personally, considered important. ...|$|R
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution in 1789, most countries and even some cities had their own system of measurement. Although different countries might have used units of measure with the same name, such as the foot, or local language equivalents such as pied, Fuß, and voet, there was no consistency in the magnitude of those units, nor in the <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> multiples and submultiples, much like the modern-day differences between the US and the UK pints and gallons.|$|E
5|$|Interscope Records {{released}} {{the song in}} August 2010 as the second single from Recovery. Critics praised its melody but were divided on thematic aspects such as poignancy and accuracy. Eminem promoted the single with performances at the 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo, the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and festivals. The music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, stars Dominic Monaghan and Megan Fox in a violent relationship and shows Eminem and Rihanna {{in front of a}} burning house. The clip had a mixed reception due to scenes of domestic violence. Reporters suggested that the song and its accompanying video were influenced by Eminem's and Rihanna's <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> respective ex-lovers Kimberly Scott and Chris Brown.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that Edward {{had a sexual}} relationship with Gaveston or his later favourites has been extensively discussed by historians, complicated by the paucity of surviving evidence to determine for certain the details of their relationships. Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, which equated it with heresy, but engaging in sex with another man did not necessarily define an individual's personal identity {{in the same way that}} it might in the 21st century. Edward and Gaveston both had sexual <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> wives, who bore them children; Edward also had an illegitimate son, and may also have had an affair with his niece, Eleanor de Clare.|$|E

One hundred and eight-one females from the La Crosse, WI area completed questionnaires regarding the <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> father as well as the <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> current (or most recent) romantic partner. The females were asked to determine what attachment style best describes each relationship, assess their satisfaction level concerning the <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> father, and asked questions regarding their communication adaptability level. Results showed that relationships could only be made between the attachment styles in the father/daughter relationships and the communication satisfaction and adaptability...|$|R
5|$|These early stelae {{depicted}} rulers as warriors or {{wearing the}} masks and headdresses of Maya deities, accompanied by texts that recorded dates and achievements during their reigns, {{as well as}} recording their <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> ancestors.

In the southern Maya area, the Late Preclassic stelae impressed upon the viewer the achievements of the king and his right to rule, thus reinforcing both his political and religious power.|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} {{having a good}} <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mother was a {{protective}} factor against risky sexual behavior for female adolescents and whether it was independent of family structure. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of in-school adolescents aged 14 - 19 years. SETTING: Catalonia, in northeast Spain. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3677 females divided according on whether {{they had a good}} (n= 3335) or a bad (n= 342) <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mother. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of sexual activity and sexual behavior. RESULTS: Adolescents in the good relationship group were significantly younger, more likely to live in an intact family, to have a good <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> father and siblings, and to talk about sexuality and <b>their</b> partner <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mother. They were also less likely to have ever had sexual intercourse. Among those sexually experienced, they were significantly older at first intercourse and less likely to have multiple partners or a history of STI. After adjusting for potential confounders, females in the good relationship group {{were less likely to be}} sexually active and to have had multiple partners, independently of family structure. CONCLUSIONS: Having a good <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mother is a protective factor against sexual intercourse and having multiple sexual partners independently of family structure. Communication between generations and having a good <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> father and siblings also play an important role...|$|R

The article focused on the largely invisible lives of lesbians in society at the time and their <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mother and father.

25|$|Another {{important}} {{issue for the}} education of Negev Bedouin girls is the relative dearth of female teachers. Especially in the post-primary schools, male teachers significantly outnumber female teachers. Of the female teachers, very few are themselves Negev Bedouin. This lack of female teachers means that female students are unable to form <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> teachers (as these teachers are male, such a level of interaction would be considered culturally taboo). This shortage of female teachers severely limits girls’ scholastic opportunities, as well as deprives them of potential role models.|$|E
