5|$|Proactiv, {{also known}} as Proactiv Solution, is a brand of skin-care {{products}} developed by two American dermatologists, Katie Rodan and Kathy Fields, and launched in 1995 by Guthy-Renker, a California-based direct marketing company.

Proactiv+, a <b>reformulation</b> of the three-step kit, was introduced in 2013.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many variational {{inequality}} problems (VIPs) can be reduced, by a compactifica-tion procedure, to a VIP on {{the canonical}} simplex. <b>Reformulations</b> {{of this problem}} are studied, including smooth <b>reformulations</b> with simple constraints and unconstrained <b>reformulations</b> based on the penalized Fischer–Burmeister function. It is proved that bounded level set results hold for these <b>reformulations</b> under quite general assumptions on the operator. Therefore, it can be guaran-teed that minimization algorithms generate bounded sequences and, under monotonicity conditions, these algorithms necessarily find solutions of the original problem. Some numerical experiments are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{splitting}} {{of variables}} in an integer programming model into {{the sum of}} other variables can allow the constraints to be disaggregated, leading to a more constrained (tighter) linear programming relaxation. Well known examples of such <b>reformulations</b> are quoted from the literature. They {{can be viewed as}} instances of some general methods of performing such <b>reformulations,</b> namely disjunctive formulations, partial network <b>reformulations</b> and a method based on the introduction of auxiliary variables...|$|R

5|$|Germany {{failed to}} {{recognize}} Lithuania as an independent state, and the Lithuanian delegation was not invited to the Brest-Litovsk negotiations that started on December 22, 1917, between the Central Powers and Russia in order to settle territorial claims. During the first and final official joint session between the Council and the German authorities, it was {{made clear that the}} Council would serve only as an advisory board. This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who were seeking independence without any ties to other countries. The prime concern at this point was to invite back those members who had left the Council. Negotiations were undertaken that led to the <b>reformulation</b> of previous versions of the Act.|$|E
5|$|John Gerard (1545–1612) is {{the most}} famous of all the English herbalists. His Herball of 1597 is, like most herbals, largely derivative. It appears to be a <b>reformulation</b> of Hieronymus Bock's Kreuterbuch {{subsequently}} translated into Dutch as Pemptades by Rembert Dodoens (1517–1585), and thence into English by Carolus Clusius, (1526–1609) then re-worked by Henry Lyte in 1578 as A Nievve Herball. This became the basis of Gerard's Herball or General Historie of Plantes. that appeared in 1597 with its 1800 woodcuts (only 16 original). Although largely derivative, Gerard's popularity can be attributed to his evocation of plants and places in Elizabethan England and to the clear influence of gardens and gardening on this work.|$|E
5|$|The TPG-led {{group of}} owners {{divested}} itself of Burger King in 2012 when the chain {{was sold to}} 3G Capital of Brazil. After 3G purchased Burger King, its new management team refocused on a broader menu strategy to lure a more diverse customer base. The first major change to the product base was a <b>reformulation</b> and name change of the company's chicken nuggets in January 2013. Along with other new products such as smoothies, wraps and chicken strips that broadly copied McDonald's menu once again, the chain reintroduced the Big King as a permanent menu item in November of the same year.|$|E

5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Recession in 2008–2009, this narrowly-defined demographic-based sales plan faltered and sales and profits for the chain declined; Burger King's same-store {{comparable}} sales in the United States and Canada declined 4.6% in the three months ended September 30, while McDonald's posted same-store comparable sales growth of 2.5% within the United States. The Stacker line underwent a minor <b>reformulation</b> in 2011 that involved deleting the top layer of cheese and changing the amount of bacon in the sandwiches, and moving the sandwiches from the core section of its menu to the company's value menu. The changed ingredient list and pricing structure created a situation such that the distribution of ingredients did not scale {{at the same rate as}} increasing numbers of burger patties. Consumer Reports' blog The Consumerist noted that two single Stackers at $1.00 included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for $2.00. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker. The Stacker line and other related calorie-heavy menu items were dropped in 2012 when 3G Capital of Brazil bought the company and initiated a menu restructuring focusing on a broader demographic base.|$|E
5|$|International {{fast-food}} restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's {{have had a}} variety of grilled chicken sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, {{and was one of}} the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another <b>reformulation</b> of the product into the BK Baguette product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDeSeRT (acronym for Détection Sémantique de <b>Reformulations</b> et de Topiques) {{has been}} {{designed}} to identify and compare rewritings, paraphrases or borrowings. It is based on the already developed idea according to which, even if the <b>reformulations</b> cannot be reduced to paraphrases, they conserve the meaning of original texts by reusing words of which meaning is close. As a consequence, the detection of co-occurrences of a few semantically equivalent lemmas in small blocks of texts is sufficient to capture the meaning and, therefore to identify the <b>reformulations</b> of the same ideas. Based on these theoreticalprinciples, the DeSeRT system is intended to spot and track <b>reformulations</b> and allusive references.
