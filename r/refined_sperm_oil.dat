5000|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>oil</b> has {{a fairly}} low {{viscosity}} (roughly equal to coconut oil). [...] It retains its viscosity in high temperatures {{better than most}} oils. It does not tend to become rancid, dry out, or corrode metals. <b>Sperm</b> <b>oil</b> cannot be hydrogenated, and thus {{could not be used}} to make soap or margarine. It is fairly resistant to oxidization.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>oil</b> is a waxy liquid {{obtained}} from sperm whales. It is a clear, yellowish liquid {{with a very}} faint odor. <b>Sperm</b> <b>oil</b> has a different composition from common whale oil. Although it is traditionally called an [...] "oil", it is technically a liquid wax. It is composed of wax esters with {{a small proportion of}} triglycerides, an ester of an unsaturated fatty acid and a branched-chain fatty alcohol. It is a natural antioxidant and heat-transfer agent. Through catalytic reaction, it carries phosphorus and sulfur derivatives providing anti-wear and friction modification. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, <b>sperm</b> <b>oil</b> was prized as an illuminant for its bright, odorless flame and as a lubricant for its low viscosity and stability. It was supplanted in the late 19th century by less expensive alternatives such as kerosene and petroleum-based lubricants. With the 1987 international ban on whaling, <b>sperm</b> <b>oil</b> is no longer legally sold.|$|R

5000|$|She left Port Jackson on 4 September 1791 for Norfolk Island and on {{the voyage}} was the first known vessel to enter Port Stephens. Salamander Point (now Nelson Head and Fly Point), Salamander Bay (now Nelson Bay), the present Salamander Bay and {{associated}} suburb were named after her. Salamander was then used as a whaler in the South Pacific and without much luck then continued to Peru. She was reported off the coast there in November 1792 with 30 tons of <b>sperm</b> <b>oil.</b> On 30 March 1793 she was [...] "all well" [...] at [...] with 132 barrels of <b>sperm</b> <b>oil</b> and 6000 seal skins.

Chili and Nimrod arrived at Halifax on 13 December, reportedly after Nimrod had cut her out of Tarpaulin Bay. A later report has Chili carrying 1210 barrels of <b>sperm</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>oil</b> was {{a popular}} lubricant. It worked well for fine, light {{machinery}} such as sewing machines and watches because it is thin, doesn't congeal or dry out and doesn't corrode metals. It was also used in heavy machinery such as locomotives and steam-powered looms because it can withstand high temperatures. [...] In the late 20th century, Jojoba oil was discovered {{to be a better}} substitute for high-friction applications because it is even more stable at high temperatures. This caused <b>sperm</b> <b>oil's</b> price to collapse to a tenth of its previous value.|$|R
50|$|Cape Bruny was {{initially}} illuminated by a Wilkins lantern, consuming one pint of <b>sperm</b> whale <b>oil</b> per hour. In 1892, <b>sperm</b> <b>oil</b> {{was replaced by}} the better quality colza oil. In 1903 the original staircase was replaced and a cast-iron staircase was installed and the Wilkins lantern was replaced with a Chance Brothers lantern, which both remain in the tower today.|$|R
