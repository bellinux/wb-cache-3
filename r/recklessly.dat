5|$|For live shows, The White Stripes {{were known}} for Jack's {{employment}} of heavy distortion, {{as well as}} audio feedback and overdrive. The duo performed considerably more <b>recklessly</b> and unstructured live, never preparing set lists for their shows, believing that planning too closely would ruin the spontaneity of their performances.|$|E
5|$|It was a mad waste. The colonists {{in their}} greed for more grass seed and sheep pasture burned {{millions}} of pounds worth of timber. They <b>recklessly</b> destroyed the wonderful {{beauty of the}} bush, baring the soil until it was carried away by landslides, and lowered the rainfall, and laid waste the homes of countless sweet songsters.|$|E
5|$|When {{hiding in}} the dark is a {{gameplay}} element, light and shadow become important parts of the level design. Usually the player is able to disable certain light sources. Stealth games also emphasize the audio design when players {{must be able to}} hear the subtle sound effects that may alert enemies to their actions; noise will often vary as the player walks on different surfaces such as wood or metal. Players who move <b>recklessly</b> will make more noise and attract more attention.|$|E
5|$|After a near {{accident}} {{at the dinner}} table, Marge begs Homer {{to get rid of}} the gun. He promises to, but later, Bart and Milhouse find it in the refrigerator's vegetable crisper. Marge discovers this and berates Homer, then leaves with the children and checks into a motel. That night, Homer hosts an NRA meeting at his house, but the other members kick him out of the association after seeing how <b>recklessly</b> he uses his pistol. Realizing what his behavior has cost him, Homer goes to the motel and tells Marge that he got rid of the gun.|$|E
5|$|Lance Henriksen was {{concerned}} {{that it would be}} out of character for Frank Black to <b>recklessly</b> take untested drugs, and suggested adding a line of dialogue—"I don't even take aspirin"—to the script to help clue the audience in to the fact that his involvement in the clinical trial was an attempt to aid his daughter. The episode begins with a quotation translated from classical Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero's treatise De finibus bonorum et malorum—"I remember the very things I do not wish to; I cannot forget the things I wish to forget". The phrase is found at the beginning of Book II of the work.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{suggests}} that Hank and Jacob return a paltry {{sum of the}} money to the plane to avoid suspicion from local authorities. While travelling on foot to the woods, the brothers come across an old man on a snowmobile. Jacob, thinking that their cover is blown, bludgeons him. When the man regains consciousness, Hank suffocates him, then uses the snowmobile to drive his body off a bridge, making the murder look like an accidental death. The following night, Lou drunkenly demands some of the money from Hank, because he has spent <b>recklessly</b> since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob about the old man's murder.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{was very}} close to his younger sister, Princess Helen, Alexander was less warm towards his elder brother George, with whom he had little in common. While his elder brother was a serious and {{thoughtful}} child, Alexander was mischievous and extroverted; he smoked cigarettes made from blotting paper, set fire to the games room in the palace, and <b>recklessly</b> lost control of a toy cart in which he and his younger brother Paul were rolling down a hill, tipping his toddler brother a distance of six feet into brambles.|$|E
5|$|After Archer <b>recklessly</b> foils an Irish terrorist's {{attempt to}} assassinate a British nobleman, Malory begins {{to suspect that}} Lana's {{feelings}} for her son are resurfacing. Hoping to readjust Lana's desires so they are steered towards her current boyfriend, Cyril, she asks Archer to train {{him to be a}} field agent. Archer is wise to their scheme though, and tries to set Cyril up to fail to sabotage his relationship with Lana, Archer's ex. At one point, Cyril inquiries about Archer’s lack of ethics, and ease of deception. To which Archer’s replies “lying is, like, 95% of what I do.” One of his sessions involves trying to kill an assassin (portrayed by Archer's butler, Woodhouse) and using a dance partner (played by a prostitute Archer has befriended) as a human shield. During the session, however, Cyril accidentally poisons the prostitute and both he and Archer pronounce her deceased.|$|E
5|$|The early stories present Valérian as {{a typical}} square-jawed hero figure, who is strong and {{dependable}} (although an early running joke was that despite being a time-traveller he is always running late, especially when summoned by his boss). However, as the series progresses, he is increasingly portrayed as somewhat knuckle-headed. In World Without Stars (Le Pays sans étoile), he gets <b>recklessly</b> drunk on the colonists' home-made booze, in On the False Earths (Sur les terres truquées), the historian, Jadna, views him as useful only as cannon fodder and nothing else while in Heroes of the Equinox (Les Héros de l'Equinoxe), he comes across as woefully inadequate compared with the champions he is competing against. Although devoted to Laureline, he has been led astray by other women, such as in Heroes of the Equinox and Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos.|$|E
5|$|Alejandro Gonzalez Malavé, the {{undercover}} agent who was accompanying the activists, was not indicted {{for his part}} in the slayings because he was granted immunity for testifying against other officers, but was removed from the police force due to public pressure. In February 1986, he was acquitted of kidnapping the taxi driver. His lawyer had argued that he was acting under orders and, therefore, it was the government who was actually guilty of kidnapping. This, despite the testimony presented by officer Carmelo Cruz who had testified that it was Gonzalez who <b>recklessly</b> endangered the hostage's life. The prosecution had provided evidence that he threatened the hostage at gunpoint, drove the car, and, when the car approached the mountaintop, refused to free the hostage despite suggestions from the activists. These actions, according to officer Cruz, were contrary to standard police procedures since his primary concern should have been the safety of the hostage. Nevertheless, the Puerto Rico Police Department did not reinstate Gonzalez as an active police officer, a fact that he publicly expressed resentment over, and subsequently threatened to provide incriminating evidence to the media about other individuals involved in the shootings unless reinstated.|$|E
5|$|Crimson Echoes {{features}} all the playable {{characters of}} the original game, and is set {{five years after the}} events of Chrono Trigger. Crono and Marle are junior regents of the Kingdom of Guardia; Lucca continues her scientific endeavors. The three struggle to ease tensions with Porre, which has modernized its military and seeks to end Guardia's economic hegemony. Frog lives in 605A.D., restored to his human form, though this was not implemented before the cease and desist letter. Magus searches for Schala in the still-frozen 11,995B.C., and feuds with Dalton, obsessed with finding artifacts from the lost Kingdom of Zeal. Ayla dwells in 64,999,995B.C., and has given birth to her tribe's successor. Robo assists the Guru of Time Belthasar, who has established a clandestine temporal research facility named Chronopolis in 2305A.D. Belthasar claims it will be a guardian of time to ensure a threat such as Lavos will never arise. He nonetheless harbors darker wishes to leave a grand legacy in history, and is almost <b>recklessly</b> pragmatic. He fixes the Epoch during the story's course, which returns as the Neo-Epoch (akin to its design in Chrono Cross).|$|E
5|$|Monique Jeffries is a {{tough and}} street-wise detective with the Special Victims Unit of the New York City Police Department. After briefly partnering with Ken Briscoe (Chris Orbach), she becomes the {{permanent}} partner of John Munch (Richard Belzer) after his previous partner, Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters), leaves the unit. The two occasionally clash personalities and have a sarcastic rapport with each other. While chasing a rape suspect during one case, Jeffries is nearly killed when the suspect gets into a car that explodes. She initially appears traumatized by the incident, but later feels exhilarated over having survived and starts behaving <b>recklessly.</b> She begins having several one-night stands and takes greater and greater risks at work, becoming something of a loose cannon at the Special Victims Unit. One night at a bar, she meets {{a man who had}} been a suspect in a previous rape case and has sex with him. When she reveals the incident during a session with a police therapist, she is taken out of active duty per One Police Plaza and works a desk job. She objects to the transfer and threatens to sue the department. Instead, she is transferred to the Vice department, and her old job in the Special Victims Unit is taken by Fin Tutuola (Ice-T).|$|E
5|$|The Singapore case Chew Kia Ngee v. Singapore Society of Accountants (1988), {{though not}} a {{judicial}} review application, illustrates how a decision-maker acts incorrectly if it fails {{to take into account}} relevant considerations. The Disciplinary Committee of the Singapore Society of Accountants had found the appellant, an auditor, guilty of an act or default discreditable to an accountant within the meaning of section 33(1)(b) of the Accountants Act because an incomplete auditor's report form that he had signed in advance had accidentally been submitted to the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The Committee had ordered that he be suspended from practice for five years. The appellant appealed the decision to the High Court on the basis that the Committee had not taken into account all the relevant considerations of the case in arriving at its decision. The Court concurred, holding that the Committee had not properly considered that the appellant had reviewed the incomplete form with his audit manager and had instructed him how to fill in the rest of it. Therefore, this was not a case of an accountant <b>recklessly</b> signing a blank form without regard to his duties as an auditor. Accordingly, the Court allowed the appeal and set aside the Committee's order.|$|E
5|$|On 16 June, United {{embarked}} for Salt Lake City for an 18 June away game at Real Salt Lake. Played at Rio Tinto Stadium, {{the venue}} {{has been considered}} by fans and media alike {{to be one of}} the most hostile environments in MLS and in North American to play in. In franchise history, United had not only failed to win in Rio Tinto, but failed to earn a point in the stadium. In spite of Salt Lake's struggling form, and United's improved form, many still expected Real to defeat United, having the home field advantage and a stronger roster. The 18 June fixture played to a 1–1 tie thanks to penalty kicks from Salt Lake's Fabian Espindola and United's Charlie Davies. The match was marred for its extremely physical, sometimes ruthless play, as well as the lack of discipline imposed by center referee, Terry Vaughn, who only gave one yellow card the entire match. Espindola scored the opening goal in the 38th minute. The penalty was drawn when Salt Lake captain, Kyle Beckerman dribbled within the goal box. As Beckerman dribbled inwards, United's Clyde Simms mistime a slide tackle that missed Beckerman, but resulted in his right wrist deflecting Beckerman's pass into the box. In the second half, United continued to control a majority of the ball position, only to see Chris Pontius's shot deflect off the crossbar in the 53rd minute. Controversy further ignited on what many fans and journalists declared a dive from United's Davies, who drew a penalty kick in the 85th minute, following a breakaway counterattack. The declaration was near universal as video replay and still frames of the incident in the penalty box revealed Davies falling in a diving motion prior to Salt Lake defender, Chris Wingert making any contact with Davies, only to do so once Davies had already fallen down. In spite of this, center official Terry Vaughn whistled it to be a penalty kick. Met with heavy jeers at Rio Tinto, Davies successfully bagged the match tying goal, in spite of the fact that Salt Lake's goalkeeper, a former United player, Nick Rimando, guessed the correct way. In the 92nd minute, during stoppage time, Salt Lake's Jamison Olave <b>recklessly</b> fouled United's Blake Brettschneider to draw a final set piece, possibly to allow United to earn a shocking road win in Salt Lake. However, Najar's free kick was successfully passed to Pontius, whose shot deflected off the crossbar, allowing the match to remain leveled at one apiece. At the match's end heavy boos were ignited by the Salt Lake crowd, primarily directed towards the officiating. The match was deemed as one of the most reckless matches of 2011.|$|E

25|$|Nahom Tsegazab {{was shot}} in the right biceps and abdomen. He fell to {{the ground in front of}} 207Danzig Street and reached for his gun, <b>recklessly</b> firing eleven rounds at Owusu, who retreated through the crowd. One of these bullets struck Owusu in the leg.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the effect}} of the {{disposition}} need be considered. It does not matter whether the debtor made the disposition deliberately to favour one of his creditors, or <b>recklessly,</b> without regard for its consequences. The debtor’s state of mind in making the disposition is irrelevant.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week NASCAR suspended Busch until June 13 and extended his probation until December 31. Busch {{was already on}} probation for the confrontation with Newman and his crew following the May 12 Sprint Cup race at Darlington and for driving <b>recklessly</b> through Newman's pit stall.|$|E
25|$|The {{jury found}} that Goetz had acted <b>recklessly</b> and had {{deliberately}} inflicted emotional distress on Cabey. Jurors stated that Goetz shooting Cabey twice {{was a key}} factor in their decision. The jury awarded Cabey $43 million – $18 million for pain and suffering and $25 million in punitive damages.|$|E
25|$|Then {{he began}} <b>recklessly</b> to utter the most shameless sayings {{and the most}} unseemly and extravagant jests, whereby he {{obtained}} innumerable gifts and presents, which none dared to pose and contend with him. Thus 'Ubayd-i-Zakani a serious writer, a moralist and a panegyrist was compelled by circumstances to become a ribald satirist.|$|E
25|$|Mark Twain {{had better}} stick to his last. He is a capital humorist {{but when he}} poses as a {{publicist}} he gets into trouble straightway. His article in the North American Review is not good humor, and is very bad politics. Some of it, moreover, seems to be <b>recklessly</b> and even libellously untrue....|$|E
25|$|After that over, {{both the}} openers looked more settled, as Chopra began to select his shots {{confidently}} and fortuitously, while Sehwag <b>recklessly</b> began {{to hit the}} ball, but did not overdo his hitting spree. Just when Sehwag seemed set for another big innings, he edged a good-length ball from Gillespie after lunch, and was caught behind for 72 (123 for 1).|$|E
25|$|Continued {{exposure}} to a yellow sun will slowly increase abilities. Many characters in the DC Universe have noted that Supergirl appears at times {{to be even more}} powerful than Superman himself; however, as Superman explains, she may appear so because he has spent a lifetime subconsciously suppressing his powers to avoid harming others while Kara, without such experience, <b>recklessly</b> uses her powers to the fullest.|$|E
25|$|John Barry and Roger Charles of Newsweek {{wrote in}} their 13 July 1992 article that Rogers acted <b>recklessly</b> and without due care. However, the {{subsequent}} Fogarty report concluded that Rogers {{acted in a}} prudent manner {{based on the information}} available to him, and the short time frame involved. He also acted according to the prescribed rules of engagement for USN warship captains in that situation.|$|E
25|$|The couple cared {{little for}} the future, spent their money <b>recklessly,</b> and {{never tried to}} live on a budget. This was {{in part because they}} had pledged a mutual suicide pact, in which they planned on October 31, 1942, when the earth would be closest to the sun in several decades, to jump out of an {{airplane}} together. This was to be followed by cremation and dispersal by another airplane.|$|E

She also gambled on the boats to and from Alaska.|$|E
25|$|López had <b>recklessly</b> {{dropped his}} policy of {{neutrality}} without determining where his allegiances lay. He allowed controversies and boundary disputes with Brazil and Argentina to smolder. The two regional giants had tolerated Paraguayan independence, partly because Paraguay served {{to check the}} expansionist tendencies of both opponents. Both were satisfied if the other could not dominate Paraguayan affairs. At the same time, a Paraguay that was antagonistic to both Brazil and Argentina would give these countries a reason for uniting.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} between what Bob had become, {{and what he}} saw himself as, led him to be impulsively inclined to follow the lead set by the more headstrong Terry, who led them <b>recklessly</b> into one scrape after another. Bob usually blamed his drinking, heavy smoking, poor diet and reckless behaviour on Terry, a view Audrey and Thelma only too willingly agreed with. This may have been true in part, but actually Bob needed little persuasion to stay out drinking with Terry or to behave accordingly.|$|E
