The vasopressin type 2 receptor (V 2 R) has been suggested to be the gene that causes the disease, and its role in disease pathogenesis is supported by mutations within this gene in affected individuals. Using the PCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct DNA sequencing, we examined the V 2 R gene in four unrelated kindreds.

40|$|AbstractThe amino acid, {{either a}} {{glutamine}} (Q) or an arginine (R), at the Q/R {{site of the}} pore-lining segment (M 2) of a vertebrate AMPA receptor subunit critically influences {{the properties of the}} receptor. The R codon of the mammalian AMPA receptor subunit 2 (GRIA 2) transcript is not coded by the chromosomal sequence, but is created by posttranscriptional RNA editing activities. On the other hand, the R codons of some teleost GRIA 2 homologs are coded by chromosomal sequences. To elucidate the evolution of the utilization of Q/R RNA editing in modifying vertebrate GRIA 2 transcripts, the GRIA 2 genes of five fish species and an amphibian were studied. The putative hagfish GRIA 2 homolog (hfGRIA 2) encodes an R codon, whereas shark and bullfrog GRIA 2 genes specify a Q codon at the genomic Q/R site. All gnathostoma GRIA 2 genes possess an intron splitting the coding regions of M 2 and the third hydrophobic region (M 3). The intronic components required for Q/R RNA editing are preserved in all the Q-coding vertebrate GRIA 2 genes but are absent from the <b>R-coding</b> GRIA 2 genes. Interestingly, the hfGRIA 2 is intronless, suggesting that hfGRIA 2 is unlikely evolved from a Q/R editing-competent gene.

40|$|Motivation: To {{understand}} cancer etiology, it {{is important}} to explore molecular changes in cellular processes from normal state to cancerous state. Because genes interact with each other during cellular processes, carcinogenesis related genes may form differential co-expression patterns with other genes in different cell states. In this study, we develop a statistical method for identifying differential gene–gene co-expression patterns in different cell states. Results: For efficient pattern recognition, we extend the traditional F-statistic and obtain an Expected Conditional F-statistic (ECF-statistic), which incorporates statistical information of location and correlation. We also propose a statistical method for data transformation. Our approach is applied to a microarray gene expression dataset for prostate cancer study. For a gene of interest, our method can select other genes that have differential gene–gene co-expression patterns with this gene in different cell states. The 10 most fre-quently selected genes, include hepsin, GSTP 1 and AMACR, which have recently been proposed to be associated with pro-state carcinogenesis. However, genes GSTP 1 and AMACR cannot be identified by studying differential gene expression alone. By using tumor suppressor genes TP 53, PTEN and RB 1, we identify seven genes that also include hepsin, GSTP 1 and AMACR. We show that genes associated with cancer may have differential gene–gene expression patterns with many other genes in different cell states. By discovering such pat-terns, {{we may be able to}} identify carcinogenesis related genes. Availability: The <b>R-codes</b> for our study are available a...|$|R

The system works through the interaction of two allelic types, one encoding wild type and the other dominant-negative receptors. We have analyzed the structure and evolution of the P locus in the platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus, where as many as nine alleles of P determining the onset of sexual maturity in males and females, fecundity in females, and adult size in males are located on both the X and Y chromosomes in a region linked to the master sex-determining locus. In this species, mc 4 r has been amplified to up to 10 copies on both the X and Y chromosomes through recent large serial duplications. Subsequently, mc 4 r paralogues have diverged considerably into many different subtypes. Certain copies have acquired new untranslated regions through genomic rearrangements, and transposable element insertions and other mutations have accumulated in promoter regions, possibly explaining observed deviations from the classical mc 4 r transcriptional pattern. In the mc 4 <b>r-coding</b> sequence, in-frame insertions and deletions as well as nonsense and missense mutations have generated a high diversity of Mc 4 r-predicted proteins. Most of these variants are expressed in embryos, adults, and/or tumors. Functional receptor characterization demonstrated major divergence in pharmacological behavior for Mc 4 r receptors encoded by different copies of platyfish mc 4 r, with differences in constitutive activity as well as binding and stimulation by hormones. The high degree of allelic and copy-number variation observed between individuals can explain the high level of polymorphism for sexual maturation, fecundity, and body size in the platyfish: multiple combinations of Mc 4 r variants with different biochemical properties might interact to modulate the melanocortin signaling that regulates the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis...|$|R
40|$|Background: The use of risk {{modelling}} in blood safety is increasing getting momentum. NBSZ initiated blood donor risk profiling based on donation frequency (<b>r-coding)</b> since 1994 and in 2006 a generic risk classification model was developed (include age and donation venue) which was mainly based on HIV risk considerations. The blood safety {{implications of this}} model, which include all the four routinely tested transfusion transmission infections (TTI) has not been studied. We aim to assess whether the use of HIV as a primary risk indicator is sufficient in Zimbabwe and the possible blood safety concerns for this. Methods: Blood donor data on HIV, HBV, HCV and Syphilis from 2002 to 2011 was analysed. The NBSZ blood donor risk model developed in 2006, which has four levels [RC I (lower) - RC IV (higher) ] of blood safety, was evaluated based on the TTIs seroprevalence results. The TTIs relative risk (RR) for usable (RC I and II) and unusable (RC III and IV) were determined and 95 % CI determined. Sub-group analysis by gender was also done to aid in explaining the results. Results: A total of 627, 072 donations were analysed. The overall TTIs seroprevalence by donor risk category are shown in Table 1. NBSZ donor risk classification seems to be performing well for all TTIs except for HBV, which has highest seroprevalence in RC II. The overall relative risk (RR) for TTIs in risk categories for unusable units over usable units is 3. 5 (95 % CI, 3. 3 - 3. 8), 1. 3 (1. 2 - 1. 3), 1. 3 (1. 1 - 1. 5) and 2. 1 (1. 9 - 2. 4) for HIV, HBV, HCV and Syphilis respectively. The average RR in all risk categories for males being TTI positive compared to females is 0. 70, 1. 95, 1. 6 and 1. 2 for HIV, HBV, HCV and Syphilis respectively. [TABLE PRESENTED] Discussion and conclusions: The results for HIV, HCV and Syphilis indicate increasing safety concerns from low (RC I) to high (RC II) as we expect the model to perform. However, the high HBV seroprevalence in RC II is of concern to blood safety as these are usable blood units. Further analysis also noted that in risk category II, which is mainly composed of new donors in schools, the HBV risk is 68 % higher when compared with other combined risk categories. Males are 95 %, 60 % and 20 % {{more likely to be}} positive for HBV, HCV and Syphilis than females. However, they are 30 % less likely to be HIV positive when compared to female donors. In conclusion, our results points to blood safety concerns for HBV in Zimbabwe and hence there is need to review the current NBSZ blood donor risk classification model taking into consideration other TTIs and cost-effectiveness analysis...|$|R
