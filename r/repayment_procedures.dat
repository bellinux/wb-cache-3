40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, HIV/AIDS {{has had a}} devastating impact {{on the lives of}} {{millions}} of people around the world. Despite successes in the roll out of HIV treatment programmes, HIV prevention programmes have been less successful in lowering incidence rates. Certain groups have been found to experience significantly higher prevalence than seen in the general population, with fishing communities representing one key group with significantly higher risk of HIV infection. In fishing communities, gender power relations and economic vulnerability intersect in ways that mean that individuals are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection. In the past decade, there has increasingly been a focus on structural drivers of HIV transmission such as gender power relations. Gender differences are fundamentally underpinned by power inequalities in society and can result in the subordination of women and their interests in a manner that favours men. This thesis set out to understand how gendered structural drivers shaped vulnerability to HIV in fishing communities, and to develop interventions to address these structural drivers. The research was conducted in two fishing communities in the rural district of Mangochi in Southern Malawi. The design of the study drew on social relations theory and second-wave feminism. The research methodology used qualitative and participatory methods to address four key research objectives: (1) to understand gender power relations in fishing communities in Southern Malawi; (2) to explore and document the key drivers and facilitators of participation in transactional sex in the study villages; (3) to document individual and community perceptions of HIV risk and transactional sex in the study villages; (4) to develop a HIV prevention strategy to address risk of HIV/AIDS among fishing communities in southern Lake Malawi. Key findings are that in fishing communities, transactional sex was common and took a variety of forms, ranging from gift-giving within relationships, to-sex-for fish exchanges, to sex worker encounters. Power differences between couples in transactional sexual encounters shaped individuals’ abilities to negotiate condom use. The context and motivations for transactional sex varied and were mediated by economic need and social position both of men and women. Microfinance is a tool that can alleviate poverty and potentially prevent HIV. However, in the fishing context microfinance loan <b>repayment</b> <b>procedures</b> often increased female fish traders’ vulnerability to HIV. Participants had a good understanding of HIV risk yet this did not result in the adoption of risk-reduction strategies. Building on these findings, the thesis presents suggested HIV interventions that were developed through participatory community workshops. Interventions identified included: working with men and boys to support transformation of gender roles and normative behaviour; enforcing legislation to improve the ecological environment to reduce the impact of decline fish stocks and environmental hazards on risk-taking behaviour; improving access to HIV testing and treatment services; and improving living and working conditions of men and women working in the fishing industry. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates the urgent need to introduce structural interventions in fishing communities in Southern Malawi and provides clear recommendations for implementing potential interventions...|$|E

30|$|To {{justify the}} {{reasons not to}} {{sanction}} loan given by FIs (section 4.5) and the suggestions given by SME owners about the areas {{that need to be}} improved by FIs (section 4.6), we asked some personnel of FIs 5 in the second phase with a structured questionnaire. In the first phase of data collection, SME owners mentioned several reasons for not giving loan by formal FIs - lack of sound financial statement, sector biases of FIs, lack of proper collateral, poor payment history, risks in business, and lack of personal guarantor. But the FIs do not agree wholly with all these reasons. From their point of view, some reasons for not giving loan to SMEs may possibly be the lack of proper financial statements and collateral, poor repayment history, sector biases and the lack of personal guarantee. In the year 2008, De la Torre and colleagues carried out a research on SME financing and they found that FIs dissuade a loan to SME owners for the opaqueness and informal environment of business, absence of the financial statement, lack of collateral, and information asymmetry. In the first stage of data collection, we also asked SME owners to give various suggestions based on their experiences in business financing to improve credit policy of FIs that can help SME owners to receive the loan from formal FIs. In reply, SME owners have recommended declining interest rate, reducing the number of required paper documents, flexibility in collateral and introducing a borrower-friendly <b>repayment</b> <b>procedure.</b> Subsequently, FIs also acknowledge aforesaid borrowers’ recommendations.|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of six Clean Coal projects revealed that recoupment decisions made by the Department limited its ability to recover the taxpayers` investment. These decisions exempted foreign sales, excluded some domestic sales on certain projects, and lowered the repayment rate on some sales. As a result, the Department may not recoup an estimated $ 133. 7 million of the taxpayers` $ 151 million investment in these six projects and may limit its opportunity to recover future investments in other energy technology programs. An analysis and justification of recoupment decisions would help ensure that the Department is balancing overall program goals of the clean coal program with their recoupment goal. Analysis and justification of recoupment decisions would also facilitate implementation of future Departmental technology transfer programs. These programs are required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to model their recoupment procedures after those of the Clean Coal Technology Program. Formal financial policies and procedures also had not been established to track, account for, and verify the accuracy of moneys due and collected from industry participants. <b>Repayment</b> policies and <b>procedures</b> would help ensure that the Department collects moneys from successfully commercialized clean coal projects. The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Coal Technology, the Deputy Controller, and the Directors, Pittsburgh and Morgantown Energy Technology Centers, agreed with the report`s recommendations. However, the Deputy Assistant Secretary cautioned that the greatest payback to the nation from the program {{will not be in}} the form of repayment of Federal cost-sharing, but rather from general contributions to a clean environment and economic prosperity (e. g., sales of equipment and jobs creation).

40|$|Agriculture is the {{backbone}} of Jordan 2 ̆ 7 s economy. It provides employment and a living for 40 per cent {{or more of the}} total population. However, very few farmers have accumulated enough capital to finance their farm operations from planting to harvest. The Agricultural Credit Corporation was established to provide farmers with credit at a relatively low cost. Without the low cost loans many farmers cannot s tay on their farms. The Agricultural Credit Corporation is the most important agency in terms of the direct help it offers to farmers. The Agricultural Credit Corporation has followed a policy of making loans at a relatively low rates of interest. As a result they have had difficulty in obtaining loans from competitive markets to meet their needs. This problem has been accentuated by a persistently low level of collections from its loans. Apparently they expect to collect no more than 85 per cent of its claims. However, during the year 1965 - 66 collections were only 44 per cent of the principal after excluding doubtful loans, and 43 percent for interest. The weaknesses of the Corporation Administration appear to be: (a) Lack of studies to determine how well the corporation is serving the needs of agricultural borrowers. (b) Lack of planning for improvement in the future. (c) Loopholes in lending rules and procedure. (d) The low limits on loans to farmers. (e) Regulations that property offered as security for a loan should not exceed 60 per cent {{of the value of the}} mortgaged property. (f) Frequency of seasons in which drought occurs and results in the inability of farmers to make payments on their loans. It is recommended that the ACC should continue to seek low cost credit from sources such as the International Development Association and similar agencies. It is also recommended ACC use all of its financial resources in lending operations instead of depositing them in commercial banks. Recommendations for correcting the existing weaknesses: (a) The Corporation should develop repayment schedules for each borrower at the time the loan is made. These should be adhered to by both the borrower and the lender. The statistics and research section of the ACC should be assigned responsibility of the schedule of <b>repayments.</b> (b) <b>Procedures</b> for appraising the value of property offered as security for a loan should be developed and used as a part of every application for a loan and before any loan has been made. (c) The upper limit on loans should be raised to 100 per cent of the appraised value of the security mortgaged rather than the present 60 per cent of loans. (d) The Corporation should establish a special fund from which emergency loans could be issued to drought stricken areas. These funds should be provided by the Treasury. This should improve the rate of collection of loans when they are due...|$|R
