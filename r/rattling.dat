5|$|The call of {{the great}} spotted {{woodpecker}} is a sharp kik, which may be repeated as a wooden <b>rattling</b> krrarraarr if the bird is disturbed. The courtship call, gwig, is mostly given in the display flight. The great spotted woodpecker drums on dead trees and branches, and sometimes suitable man-made structures, to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.|$|E
5|$|The calls made by caecilians and {{salamanders}} {{are limited}} to occasional soft squeaks, grunts or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a form of communication. Most salamanders are considered voiceless, but the California giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus) has vocal cords and can produce a <b>rattling</b> or barking sound. Some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.|$|E

5|$|The {{masked shrike}} gives the harsh calls typical of this family, with {{repeated}} tsr, tzr or shek notes and some whistles, and when alarmed produces a <b>rattling</b> krrrr. The bill may be snapped when {{the bird is}} agitated. The song, up to a minute long, is soft for a shrike, with chattering sounds interspersed with rich warbles. It resembles the songs of Hippolais species, particularly the olive-tree warbler. On rare occasions, males may sing in flight.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} Schuylkill County in East Union Township, Catawissa Creek flows approximately west-southwest into a valley. In the valley, it goes {{past the}} geographical features called Round Head and Blue Head, {{picking up a}} tributary near Blue Head. Beyond Blue Head, the creek flows past Sheppton and then Brandonville. It picks up a tributary called <b>Rattling</b> Run {{at the edge of}} the township, shortly before entering Union Township.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Catawissa Creek {{was found by}} the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to have good {{temperatures}} for trout habitation, {{but there was no}} aquatic life in the creek due to acid mine drainage. This situation continued through the 1960s and 1970s. However, by 1997, large populations of wild trout were found on some tributaries of Catawissa Creek. As of 2003, Catawissa Creek {{is considered to be a}} cold-water fishery between its headwaters and its confluence with <b>Rattling</b> Run. Several other tributaries, namely Dark Run, Davis Run, Little Catawissa Creek, and Messers Run are designated as high-quality cold water fisheries.|$|E

5|$|Several {{problems}} were experienced with the iPhone 5S's hardware after its release. The most widely reported {{issue is that}} the angle reported by the phone's level sensor had drifted by several degrees, which caused the gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer to become inaccurate. Reports suggested {{that this is a}} hardware-induced problem. Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting, the power button making a <b>rattling</b> noise when the phone was shaken, overheating, the microphone not working, and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases. Some of these issues have been fixed by software updates.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{downstream}} of {{the confluence}} of Catawissa Creek with Messers Run, the pH of Catawissa Creek ranges between 4.1 and 6.2, {{with an average of}} 4.5. Further downstream, at Davis Run, the pH changes to 4.5 to 4.9, and averages 4.64. After picking up <b>Rattling</b> Run, Dark Run, and Little Catawissa Creek, but before picking up Tomhicken Creek, Catawissa Creek's pH ranges from 3.2 to 6.4 and averages 4.96. After the confluence with Tomhicken Creek, Catawissa Creek's pH ranges from 4.7 to 5.4.|$|E
5|$|Fenton and Licht {{note that}} the effect of a rattlesnake's <b>rattling</b> could be deimatic (startle) in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large animals that might injure the snake by {{stepping}} on it, but aposematic (a warning signal) in animals that are aware of the rattle's meaning. They refer to the work of Fenton and his colleague David Bates on the responses of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to the defensive clicks made by moths in the family Arctiidae, which includes the garden tiger moth, Arctia caja. This family includes large, furry, bitter-tasting or poisonous moths. They found that while sounds can startle inexperienced bats, after a few trials the bats ignored the sounds if the prey was edible; but the same sounds can warn experienced bats of bitter-tasting prey (an honest signal).|$|E
50|$|Native American {{people often}} use <b>rattles</b> in {{ceremonial}} dances. Oftentimes, these <b>rattles</b> {{are meant to}} represent something. Each figure or depiction can relate to something sacred to their tribe. Often, the sound of <b>rattles</b> forms {{a connection to the}} supernatural world when the <b>rattles</b> are employed by shamans. The use of the raven <b>rattle,</b> like the one pictured to the right, always implies power, which when used in dances, symbolize the status of the chief, who has a hereditary right to use the <b>rattle.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>rattle</b> {{is a type}} of {{percussion}} instrument {{which produces}} a sound when shaken. <b>Rattles</b> are described in the Hornbostel-Sachs system as Shaken Idiophones or <b>Rattles</b> (112.1).|$|R
50|$|<b>Rattles</b> {{can be made}} of wood, {{plastic or}} cloth. Many of the <b>rattles</b> are brightly colored, have animal or flower shapes, and {{typically}} make sounds when shaken. These sounds can range from the dull sounds typical of wooden <b>rattles</b> to the jingling or bell type sounds that metal <b>rattles</b> make.|$|R
5|$|Gordon later calls Sam and Dean, {{threatening}} {{to kill a}} young woman {{if they do not}} meet him. They head to the location and find the woman, but Gordon uses a roller door to separate the brothers. The woman is revealed to be a vampire turned by Gordon, and Dean is forced to shoot her with the Colt—a mystical gun capable of killing anything. He then attempts to help Sam, but Gordon prepares to bite him. Sam prevents this and garrotes Gordon with a razor wire, decapitating the vampire. Sam and Dean later stop {{on the side of the}} road to check a <b>rattling</b> noise made by the Impala. Sam is confused when Dean starts explaining the engine's problem. Dean, however, reasons that Sam should know how to fix the car when his remaining time runs out, and also notes that, as his older brother, he should be showing him the ropes.|$|E
5|$|The pupae of some moths {{are able}} to wriggle their abdomen. The three caudal {{segments}} of the pupal abdomen (segments 8–10) are fixed; the other segments are movable to some degree. While the more evolved Lepidoptera can wriggle only the last two-three segments {{at the end of}} the abdomen, more basal taxa such as the Micropterigidae can wriggle the remaining seven segments of the abdomen; this presumably helps them to protrude the anterior end from the pupal case before eclosion. The pupae of Hepialidae {{are able to}} move back and forth in the larval tunnel by wriggling, aided by projections on the back in addition to spines. Abdominal wriggling is considered to be of startle value and discouraging to predators. In the case of a few hawk moths, such as Theretra latreillii, the wriggling of the abdomens is accompanied by a <b>rattling</b> or clicking sound which adds to the startle effect.|$|E
5|$|Under British Rail, many {{passenger}} services on the Amlwch branch operated through to Bangor, removing {{the need to}} change trains at Gaerwen. An early three-coach British United Traction (A.E.C.) diesel multiple unit train was trialled {{on the line in}} May 1953. The train was economical in fuel use, and did not require a fireman, but train passengers and crew complained at the very rough ride - <b>rattling</b> windows a particular complaint. As part of British Rail's Modernisation Plan, Derby Lightweight DMUs were introduced three years later. A 1956 brochure advertised day return tickets from Bangor to Amlwch for 4s.4d, or Llangefni for 11d. Steam engines continued to be used for freight trains, and for extra workings such as Saturday trains. Steam returned for all passenger trains in the summers of 1963 and 1964 due to a shortage of DMUs.|$|E

5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} of the piano, {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original notes, or metallic, <b>rattling</b> sounds that have no sense of the fundamental frequency at all. The use of the soft pedal, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, but it sounds fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E

40|$|Human {{response}} to sonic booms heard indoors {{is affected by}} the generation of contact-induced <b>rattle</b> noise. The annoyance caused by sonic boom-induced <b>rattle</b> noise was studied in a series of psychoacoustics tests. Stimuli were divided into three categories and presented in three different studies: isolated <b>rattles</b> at the same calculated Perceived Level (PL), sonic booms combined with <b>rattles</b> with the mixed sound at a single PL, and sonic booms combined with <b>rattles</b> with the mixed sound at three different PL. Subjects listened to sounds over headphones and were asked to report their annoyance. Annoyance to different <b>rattles</b> was shown to vary significantly according to <b>rattle</b> object size. In addition, the combination of low-amplitude sonic booms and <b>rattles</b> can be more annoying than the sonic boom alone. Correlations and regression analyses for the combined sonic boom and <b>rattle</b> sounds identified the Moore and Glasberg Stationary Loudness (MGSL) metric as a primary predictor of annoyance for the tested sounds. Multiple linear regression models were developed to describe annoyance to the tested sounds, and simplifications for applicability to a wider range of sounds are presented...|$|R
