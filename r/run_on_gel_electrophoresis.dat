5000|$|The first type of {{molecular}} marker developed and <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> were allozymes. These markers {{are used for}} the detection of protein variation. The word [...] "allozyme" [...] (also known as [...] "alloenzyme") comes from [...] "allelic variants of enzymes." [...] When run on a gel, proteins are separated by size and charge. Although allozymes may seem dated when compared to the other markers available, they are still used today, mainly due to their low cost. One major downside is that since there is only a limited amount available, specificity an issue.|$|E
50|$|The {{experimental}} procedure first {{requires an}} aliquot of purified plasmid DNA (see appendix) for each digest to be run. Digestion is then performed with each enzyme(s) chosen. The resulting samples are subsequently <b>run</b> <b>on</b> an <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>gel,</b> typically <b>on</b> agarose <b>gel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Those {{fragments}} {{are then}} <b>run</b> <b>on</b> a <b>Gel</b> <b>electrophoresis,</b> {{where they are}} separated according to size: the application of electrical field to the gel {{in which they are}} suspended causes the movement of DNA fragments (all negatively charged due to the presence of phosphate groups) through a matrix towards the positively charged end of the field. Small fragments move more easily and rapidly through the matrix, reaching a bigger distance from the starting position than larger fragments.|$|R
50|$|A molecular-weight size marker, also {{referred}} to as a protein ladder, DNA ladder, or RNA ladder, is a set of standards that are used to identify the approximate size of a molecule <b>run</b> <b>on</b> a <b>gel</b> during <b>electrophoresis,</b> using the principle that molecular weight is inversely proportional to migration rate through a gel matrix.

40|$|Avastin® (bevacizumab) is {{a protein}} drug widely used for cancer {{treatment}} although its further use is questionable due to {{serious side effects}} reported. As no systematic proteomic study on posttranslational modifications (PTMs) was reported so far, it was {{the aim of the}} current study to use a gel-based proteomics method for determination of Avastin®-protein(s). Avastin® was <b>run</b> <b>on</b> two-dimensional <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> (2 -DE), spots were picked, followed by multi-enzyme in-gel digestion. Subsequently, the resulting peptides and posttranslational modifications were identified by mass spectrometry (nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS; HCT and LTQ Orbitrap MS). Heavy and light chains were observed and the 9 spots that were picked from 2 DE-gels were identified as bevacizumab with high sequence coverage. MS/MS results showed multiple tyrosine nitrations on the Avastin® light and heavy chains that were either represented as nitrotyrosine or as aminotyrosine, which was shown to be generated from nitrotyrosine under reducing conditions. Protein nitration is known to significantly change protein functions and interactions and {{it may well be that}} some of the adverse effects of the protein drug Avastin® may be due to this PTM, which may have been generated during production [...] thus, nitration of Avastin® is a challenge for the pharmaceutical industry...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—The {{mechanisms}} of excitotoxic cell death in cerebral ischemia are poorly understood. In addition to necrosis, apoptotic cell death may occur. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether an established model of cerebral hypoxia-ischemia in the neonatal rat demonstrates any features of apoptosis. Methods—Seven-day-old neonatal rats underwent bilateral, permanent carotid ligation followed by 1 hour of hypoxia, and their brains were examined 1, 3, and 4 days after hypoxia-ischemia. The severity of ischemic damage was assessed in the dentate gyrus and frontotemporal cortex by light microscopy. Immunocytochemistry was performed to detect the cleavage of actin by caspases, a family of enzymes activated in apoptosis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase– mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) reactivity was examined in the cortical infarction bed and dentate gyrus. Neonatal rat brain DNA was <b>run</b> <b>on</b> agarose <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> to detect DNA fragmentation. Ethidium bromide–staining and electron microscopy were used to determine whether apoptotic bodies, 1 of the hallmarks of apoptosis, were present. Results—The frontotemporal cortex displayed evidence of infarction, and in most rats the dentate gyrus showed selective, delayed neuronal death. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated caspase-related cleavage of actin. TUNEL and DNA electrophoresis provided evidence of DNA fragmentation. Ethidium bromide–staining and electron microscopy confirmed the presence of chromatin condensation and apoptotic bodies...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple method}} to isolate and culture liver pigment cells from Rana esculenta L. is {{described}} which utilizes a pronase digestion of perfused liver, followed by sedimentation on a Ficoll gradient. A first characterization of isolated and cultured cells is also reported. They show both positivity for nonspecific esterases, and phagocytosis ability, like {{the cells of}} phagocytic lineage. Furthermore, after stimulation with a phorbol ester, these cells generate superoxide anions. At phase contrast microscope, liver pigment cells present variability in size, morphology, and in their content of dark-brown granules. Inasmuch as a cell extract obtained from cultured cells exhibits a specific protein band with dopa-oxidase activity, when <b>run</b> <b>on</b> nondenaturing polyacrylamide <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis,</b> liver pigment cells from Rana esculenta L. {{should not be considered}} as melanophages, but as cells that can actively synthesize melanin.

40|$|Bladder {{cancer is}} the ninth most common cancer in the world, and occurs in nearly four percent of all men. Although many cases are {{diagnosed}} as early stage cancer and the tumor can be removed by surgery, reoccurrence rates are high making treatment difficult and thus {{one of the most}} expensive cancers. To address this problem, drugs are injected intravesically after tumor removal to kill any residual cancer that may cause reoccurrence. While this was a significant improvement over surgery alone, high toxicity along with short residence times in the bladder limited its effectiveness. To combat these shortcomings, we will use short strands of DNA which cause an immune response to kill residual cancer. Unfortunately DNA is not readily taken up without first neutralizing the negative charge. In this study, nanoparticles were formed by neutralizing the DNA with varying positively charged polymers. Measurements were taken using Dynamic Light Scattering which determines size and dispersity of the nanoparticles. Stability was measured using heparin challenge and was <b>run</b> <b>on</b> agarose <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis.</b> After successful formulation of stable particles, a secondary coating of a modified fusion protein is planned to be used to confer enhanced stability as well as targeting. Chemical modification of the fusion protein via EDC (1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide) coupling, was done along with purification, and characterization by SDS PAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide <b>Gel</b> <b>Electrophoresis),</b> and Mass Spectrometry.

30|$|Bacterial genomic DNA {{extraction}} {{was done}} using the ZR Soil Microbes DNA Mini-Prep extraction kit (Zymo Research Corporation, South Africa). The quantity and {{purity of the}} extracted genomic DNA bacterial isolates were analysed using an ND- 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermoscientific, Inqaba Biotech, South Africa) and agarose <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis.</b> The genomic DNA was stored at − 20  °C. The amplification of the 16 S rRNA gene of the isolates was carried out using primer set 27 F (51 AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG- 31) and 1492 R (51 GGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT 31). The PCR reaction {{was carried out in}} 25  µL volumes containing 12.5  µL of the Master Mix (Zymo Master Mix), 0.4  µL of each primer, and mixed with 5  µL of the DNA template. Sterile nuclease-free water of volume, 6.7  µL, was added. The following PCR conditions were used: initial denaturation at 95  °C for 5  min, denaturation (95  °C for 30  s.), annealing 52  °C for 30  s, extension (72  °C for 45  s.), and final extension step at 72  °C for 3  min was cooled for 4  °C. Five microliters (5  µL) of the amplified products were <b>run</b> <b>on</b> agarose <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> at 120  V for 15  min to determine the quality of the products. The amplified products were also purified using the DNA clean and concentrator (DCC) kit (Zymo research institute, South Africa) before being made ready for sequencing. PCR products of the bacterial DNA were sequenced using the Sanger method of sequencing with 3500 ABI genetic analyser, at Inqaba Biotechnical Industries, South Africa. The sequences generated by the sequencer were visualized using Chromaslite for base calling. BioEdit was used for sequence editing; Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was performed using NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database.

40|$|Hcp is a 28 -kDa {{secreted}} protein of Vibrio cholerae regulated coordinately {{with the}} hemolysin, HlyA. Both proteins show a dependence on HlyU for expression, suggesting that Hcp may be secreted by V. cholerae in vivo. We have identified and sequenced two genes for Hcp, designated hcpA and hcpB (hemolysin-coregulated protein). The genes encode identical amino acid sequences. Both express a 28 -kDa protein, despite open reading frames {{with only a}} 19 -kDa capacity, suggesting that the Hcp protein <b>runs</b> aberrantly <b>on</b> polyacrylamide <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis.</b> There is no cleavage involved in secretion of Hcp from the cell, suggesting a novel mechanism of secretion. An hcp null mutant was constructed, and this strain displayed no deficiency in virulence or colonization in the infant mouse cholera model. From sequence data and primer extension analysis, we predict that the hcp promoter is the sigma 54 type, with a candidate integration host factor binding site upstream. Although hcp and hlyA are coregulated by HlyU, there are no obvious similarities between their promoters. We predict that an intermediate regulator {{may be involved in}} the activation of hcp by HlyU. This raises the possibility that HlyU is part of a regulatory cascade...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{phosphorylation}} is {{a common}} post-translational modification of enormous biological importance. Analysis of phosphorylation {{at the global level}} should shed light on the use of this modification to regulate metabolism, signal transduction, and other processes. We have begun a proteomic analysis of phosphorylation using two-dimensional <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis.</b> Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were metabolically labeled using 32 P-orthophosphate. The proteins were extracted and <b>run</b> <b>on</b> two-dimensional <b>electrophoresis.</b> <b>Gels</b> were stained using colloidal Coomassie stain, dried, and phosphorimaged. The Coomassie stain allowed the observation of 468 individual protein spots. The phosphorimage showed 181 spots. The phosphoproteome of CHO cells therefore comprises around one third as many proteins as the CHO cell abundance proteome. However, the most intense spots in the phosphoproteome usually do not correlate with intense spots in the abundance proteome. We investigated the effects of labeling time, finding that the number of observable spots increases but the relative intensities also change. We also investigated the effects of adding a phosphatase inhibitor during labeling. Finally, we evaluated a phosphoprotein-specific stain (Pro-Q Diamond) in comparison with radiolabeling methods. There is not perfect correlation between radiolabeled phosphoproteinsand Pro-Q Diamond-stained phosphoproteins...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Morphine {{is used in}} {{clinical}} practice as a highly effective painkiller {{as well as the}} drug of choice for treatment of certain heart diseases. However, there is lack of information about its effect on protein expression in the heart. Therefore, here we aimed to identify the presumed alterations in rat myocardial protein levels after prolonged morphine treatment. Methods Morphine was administered to adult male Wistar rats in high doses (10 mg/kg per day) for 10 days. Proteins from the plasma membrane- and mitochondria-enriched fractions or cytosolic proteins isolated from left ventricles were <b>run</b> <b>on</b> 2 D <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis,</b> scanned and quantified with specific software to reveal differentially expressed proteins. Results Nine proteins were found to show markedly altered expression levels in samples from morphine-treaded rats and these proteins were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. They belong to different cell pathways including signaling, cytoprotective, and structural elements. Conclusions The present identification of several important myocardial proteins altered by prolonged morphine treatment points to global effects of this drug on heart tissue. These findings represent an initial step toward a more complex view on the action of morphine on the heart. </p...|$|R
40|$|The gene {{order of}} the {{chloroplast}} genome of Podocarpus macrophylla has been determined twice [...] once by shotgun sequencing, and, with a different sample, once by physical mapping. Although the gene order {{should be the same}} regardless of method, these two gene maps are inconsistent � 2 ̆ 2 a large region of genes is inverted in one map relative to the other. It is possible that the sequence-based map is incorrect, since mapping using sequence data is indirect, and because various attributes of sequence data can sometimes lead to misassembly causing inversions in maps.

Therefore, I am preparing a physical map using the Podocarpus macrophylla DNA sample, in order to compare directly a physical map and the sequence-based map. I have designed a physical mapping strategy that uses restriction enzymes that will generate distinct fragment patterns when the enzyme-digested Podocarpus DNA is <b>run</b> <b>on</b> a <b>gel</b> using <b>electrophoresis.</b> Depending <b>on</b> which set of fragments I recover I will be able to determine which gene order is actually correct...|$|R
40|$|Tellurite {{containing}} compounds are in use {{for industrial}} processes and increasing delivery {{into the environment}} generates specific pollution that may well result in contamination and subsequent potential adverse effects on public health. It was {{the aim of the}} current study to reveal mechanism of toxicity in tellurite-sensitive and tellurite-resistant E. coli at the protein level. In this work an approach using gel-based mass spectrometrical analysis to identify a differential protein profile related to tellurite toxicity was used and the mechanism of ter operon-mediated tellurite resistance was addressed. E. coli BL 21 was genetically manipulated for tellurite-resistance by the introduction of the resistance-conferring ter genes on the pLK 18 plasmid. Potassium tellurite was added to cultures in order to obtain a final 3. 9 micromolar concentration. Proteins from tellurite-sensitive and tellurite-resistant E. coli were <b>run</b> <b>on</b> 2 -D <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis,</b> spots of interest were picked, in-gel digested and subsequently analysed by nano-LC-MS/MS (ion trap).

Following exposure to tellurite, in contrast to tellurite-resistant bacteria, sensitive cells exhibited increased levels of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutases, catalase and oxidoreductase YqhD. Cysteine desulfurase, known to be related to tellurite toxicity as well as proteins involved in protein folding: GroEL, DnaK and EF-Tu were upregulated in sensitive cells.

40|$|Guinea pigs {{were used}} to {{determine}} whether immunization and challenge by toluene diisocyanate (TDI) induce changes in the serum protein concentrations of the "acute-phase response" and whether TDI can form adducts with serum proteins. METHODS: Guinea pigs were immunized by weekly intradermal injections of TDI and challenged with TDI 7 days after the 3 rd injection. The animals were killed 6 hours after the challenge, and serum was analyzed for protein characterization by <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> and for specific antibodies to TDI by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. RESULTS: The total serum protein concentration of the immunized TDI-challenged guinea pigs increased in comparison with that of nonimmunized animals [75 (SE 0. 7) versus 47. 4 (SE 2. 3) mg/ml;]. Albumin and alpha, and alpha 2 globulins increased significantly [respectively: 65. 8 (SE 0. 2) %, 2. 1 (SE 0. 1) % and 7. 2 (SE 0. 1) % versus 59 (SE 1. 3) %, 1. 3 (SE 0. 1) % and 3. 7 (SE 0. 1) %], whereas beta 1 and beta 2 globulins decreased in the immunized TDI-challenged guinea pigs [7. 8 (SE 0. 2) % and 0. 8 (SE 0. 2) % versus 15. 8 (SE 0. 7) % and 4. 8 (SE 0. 2) %]. The gamma globulin concentrations did not change significantly. In the immunized TDI-challenged animals, albumin was modified by TDI and <b>ran</b> faster <b>on</b> agarose <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> than did albumin from nonimmunized guinea pigs. In the ELISA, only immunized animals had high titers of TDI-specific antibodies (IgG and IgG 1); by blotting, the antibodies reacted against TDI, the TDI-BSA-conjugate and several TDI-conjugated guinea pig serum proteins, but they did not react against any native or denaturated serum protein when unconjugated with TDI. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that, in guinea pigs, immunization and challenge with TDI induces changes in serum proteins of the "acute phase response" and TDI is adducted to serum proteins with different molecular weights (eg, albumin) ...|$|R
