40|$|<b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> (USW) is a {{technique}} used to bond materials together by heating the bonding surfaces with ultrasound. Its main advantage is the high processing speed, {{which is in the}} order of seconds. However, application of this technique with thermoplastic composite (TPC) materials is still limited. One of the areas in which almost no research has been done is continuous <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> of TPCs. This MSc thesis therefore explores some possibilities on a continuous variant of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> process, applicable to TPCs.

The design has been tested by comparing welds made with it with welds made on a conventional machine. The machine works correctly, but the frame has to be made stiffer, for which recommendations are made. Research was conducted into multiple-pass welding as well, as it is a potential solution for some of the problems sequential <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> is facing.

This paper presents the first {{investigation into the}} use of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> to activate a mendable polymer, poly[ethylene-co-(methacrylic acid) ] (EMAA), for healing a carbon-epoxy laminate. Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness tests were carried out on specimens containing two different concentration levels of interlaced EMAA fibres to quantify the healing efficiency of ultrasonic vibration. Experimental results reveal that bursts of short-duration, high frequency ultrasonic pulses are able to thermally activate the mendable polymer to repair delamination cracks. Examinations of the fracture surface indicate partial healing of delamination cracks, which were sufficient to completely recover delamination toughness (repair efficiency up to 130 %). Furthermore, multiple repairs and recoveries of interlaminar fracture toughness of the composite were achieved with <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding.</b> The repair efficiency using <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding,</b> however, {{was found to be}} less than conventional heating by thermal oven.

40|$|AbstractUltrasonic welding offers {{ability to}} weld thin layers of {{malleable}} metals at low temperature and low power consumption. During <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding,</b> intensive material interactions occur {{due to the}} severe plastic deformation (SPD) and frictional heat generation, {{which leads to the}} microstructural change. Different grain microstructures have been observed after different <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> conditions. Theory of the microstructural evolution was for the first time hypothesized as three regimes, namely SPD, dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and grain growth according to the material thermomechanical loading conditions. A novel metallo-thermo-mechanically coupled model was developed to model the temperature-dependent mechanical deformation and microstructural evolution during the <b>ultrasonic</b> spot <b>welding</b> process. The numerical analysis was carried out with a three-dimensional (3 D) finite element model using DEFORM 11. 0. The material constitutive model considered cyclic plasticity, thermal softening and acoustic softening. Dynamic recrystallization and grain growth kinetics laws were applied to simulate the microstructural evolution under different welding time durations. The simulation results demonstrated that the essential characteristics of the deformation field and microstructure evolution during <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> were well captured by the metallo-thermo-mechanically coupled model.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the latest research on <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> of composites performed at the Delft University of Technology. Firstly, we showed that for thermoplastic composites, a simple flat energy director shape, made of a loose film of neat resin, can be used to produce welds of high quality. Furthermore, for single lap shear coupons, it was shown that the use of a microprocessor-controlled welder allows for in-situ monitoring through power and sonotrode displacement data. As a result, a smart <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> procedure was designed in which the feedback from the ultrasonic welder was used to define the processing parameters that yield optimum weld quality, significantly decreasing development times. Based on the knowledge developed at a lab-scale level, a welding strategy was developed to demonstrate the assembly of small and medium-sized components. Experimental comparison between ultrasonically spot-welded and mechanically fastened joints into double-lap shear and pull-through configurations further outlined the potential application of this technology, as well as its limitations. While <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> is an efficient technique to join thermoplastic composites components, another potential application was shown to be the welding of thermoplastic and thermoset composites, enabled through the very short heating times in the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> process. This opens up new possibilities for <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> where optimum design and manufacturing of aircraft parts call for the assembly of dissimilar materials, and could lead to significant costs and weight reduction as compared to mechanical fastening. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{applications}} of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>welding</b> are extensive and {{are found in}} many industries including electrical and computer, automotive and aerospace, medical, and packaging. Whether two items can be ultrasonically welded is determined by their thickness. If they are too thick this process will not join them. This is the main obstacle in the welding of metals.
