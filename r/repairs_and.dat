40|$|Farm {{machineries}} play {{important role}} to the plantation sector {{in order to reduce}} the human labour and make the agricultural activities more efficiently and save the working hours at the field. In order to estimate <b>repair</b> <b>and</b> maintenance of farm machineries, there are several data needed such as horsepower of tractors, annual use of hours of tractors, age of the tractors, <b>and</b> <b>repair</b> costs of tractors. The study was conducted to develop <b>repair</b> <b>and</b> maintenance costs model of farm machinery in oil palm and paddy cultivation. Field observation, interview, and secondary data extraction from the companies data has been used to obtain the data in this study. Multiple linear regression was used for the data analysis in SPSS to formulate the new model in estimating <b>repair</b> <b>and</b> maintenance costs of farm machineries afterwards. The result successfully develop of this study was the <b>repair</b> <b>and</b> maintenance costs model in oil palm and paddy has been developed with R-square value of 0. 898 and 0. 756 respectively. The sensitivity analysis of each of the two <b>repair</b> <b>and</b> maintenance costs model showed that all the variables correlated and significant to the respective <b>repair</b> <b>and</b> maintenance costs will have positive impact on the <b>repair</b> <b>and</b> maintenance cost. Other than that, this research also compared <b>repair</b> <b>and</b> maintenance costs of farm machinery between oil palm and paddy. Conclusively, this study is quite useful for the strategic planning and make better allocation of the company to estimate of total cost in farm machinery...|$|R
