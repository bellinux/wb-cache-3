5000|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> is a {{union that}} allows for {{rotation}} of the united parts. It is thus a device that provides a seal between a stationary supply passage (such as pipe or tubing) and a rotating part (such as a drum, cylinder, or spindle) to permit the flow of a fluid into and/or out of the rotating part. Fluids typically used with rotary joints and rotating unions include various heat transfer media and fluid power media such as steam, water, thermal oil, hydraulic fluid, and coolants.A <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> is {{sometimes referred to as}} a rotating union, rotary valve, swivel union, rotorseal,rotary couplings, rotary joint, rotating joints, hydraulic coupling, pneumatic <b>rotary</b> <b>union,</b> through bore <b>rotary</b> <b>union,</b> air <b>rotary</b> <b>union,</b> electrical <b>rotary</b> <b>union,</b> or vacuum <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Many rotary unions {{incorporate}} multiple ports, some {{of which}} are designed to handle different types of material simultaneously. A <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> with a straight port transfers the substance directly through the <b>rotary</b> <b>union.</b> Other designs include an elbow port, which causes the material to flow out at an angle, and multiple ports. A multiple port <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> looks like a perforated cylinder. At the end of the cylinder is a threaded screw with seals that locks on to the output. The material being transferred flows into the cylinder and out of the input holes. In the case of a <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> with multiple inputs, chambers separated by seals keep the materials from inadvertently mixing. This type of <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> is often used in the manufacture of plastics and other petroleum products, for which multiple inputs may need to be streamlined, but kept separate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second most}} {{important}} part of the <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> is the bearing. A <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> may have only one bearing, but multiple bearing are much more common. Roller bearings; such as ball bearings and tapered roller bearings; or non-roller bearings, like graphite bearings and bronze brushings, may be used in a <b>rotary</b> <b>union.</b> The bearings are always used to allow a part of the joint, either the shaft or the housing, to rotate ...|$|E
50|$|Equipment used in grain {{harvesting}} including combines, tractors, grain carts and threshers employ <b>rotary</b> <b>unions.</b> Once harvested, many crops will be processed with equipment that uses <b>rotary</b> <b>unions.</b> Food processing equipment that use <b>rotary</b> <b>unions</b> include cooling conveyors, flaking mills, shredders, steam cookers, starch dryers, rotary cutters and roll-forming.|$|R
50|$|Many {{assembly}} lines incorporate multiple <b>rotary</b> <b>unions,</b> {{because they are}} highly versatile and take up less space than other devices designed for a similar purpose. <b>Rotary</b> <b>unions</b> also appear in automobiles and other machines that require constant supplies of lubrication, air, or other liquids in order for moving parts to run smoothly. Brakes, for example, use <b>rotary</b> <b>unions</b> to maintain a constant supply of pressurized brake fluid. <b>Rotary</b> <b>unions</b> are also heavily used in crude oil processing, the chemical industry, commercial food production, and pharmaceutical applications.|$|R

5000|$|The {{heart of}} the <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> is the seal. The seal {{prevents}} the medium from leaking outside the <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> while in operation. Seal types can vary from pusher-type end face mechanical seal, non-pusher type end face mechanical seal, lip seals, and o-ring seals. Most rotary unions {{have more than one}} seal[...]|$|E
50|$|A {{slip ring}} {{can be used}} within a <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> to {{function}} concurrently with the device, {{commonly referred to as}} a rotary joint. Slip rings do the same for electrical power and signal that rotary unions do for fluid media. They are often integrated into rotary unions to send power and data to and from rotating machinery in conjunction with the media that the <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> provides.|$|E
50|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> will lock onto {{an input}} valve while {{rotating}} {{to meet an}} outlet. During this time the liquid and/or gas will flow into the <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> from its source and will be held within the device during its movement. This liquid and/or gas will leave the union when the valve openings meet during rotation and more liquid and/or gas will flow into the union again for the next rotation.Often functioning under high pressure and constant movement a <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> is designed to rotate around an axis. A rotary union’s design can be altered to change this or to increase the psi or rpm it needs to withstand {{as well as the}} number of valves required.|$|E

5000|$|The {{housing is}} the {{component}} that holds {{all of the}} other elements of the <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> together. The housing has an inlet port, which is a threaded port to which the hose supplying the medium will be attached. The <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> may also have an outlet port, if the same joint is being used both to supply fluid to a roll and to remove fluid from the roll.

40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{installed}} {{and tested}} two hydraulically connected SpinTek rotary microfilter (RMF) units to determine {{the behavior of a}} multiple filter system. Both units were successfully controlled by a control scheme written in DELTA-V architecture by Savannah River Remediation (SRR) Process Control Engineering personnel. The control system was tuned to provide satisfactory response to changing conditions during the operation of the multi-filter system. Stability was maintained through the startup and shutdown of one of the filter units while the second was still in operation. The installation configuration originally proposed by the Small Colum Ion Exchange (SCIX) project of independent filter and motor mountings may be susceptible to vibration. Significant stiffening of the filter and motor mounts was required to minimize the vibration. Alignment of the motor to the filter was a challenge in this test configuration. The deployment configuration must be easy to manipulate and allow for fine adjustment. An analysis of the vibration signature of the test system identified critical speeds. Whether it corresponds to the resonance frequency of a rotor radial vibration mode that was excited by rotor unbalance is uncertain based upon the measurements. A relative motion series should be completed on the filter with the final shaft configuration to determine if the resonances exist in the final filter design. The instrumentation selected for deployment, including the concentrate discharge control valve and flow meters, performed well. Automation of the valve control integrated well with the control scheme and when used in concert with the other control variables, allowed automated control of the dual RMF system. The one area of concern with the instrumentation was the condition resulting when the filtrate flow meter operated with less than three gpm. This low flow was at the lower range of performance for the flow meter. This should not be an issue in deployment where the desired flow rate will be within the normal operating range of the meter. Testing demonstrated that the use of a flexible line for the filtrate discharge is highly desired at the outlet of the <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> to transition to the system piping. Isolating the vibration from the <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> will significantly improve the lifetime of the seals. Methods to monitor and isolate individual filters should be considered during deployment. The ability to diagnose issues and isolate individual filters would allow isolation prior to failure. Thus, filters may be cleaned or repaired instead of requiring complete replacement if the condition were to continue unnoticed. Isolating the filtrate line of each filter during startup will minimize the premature buildup of solids on the filter disks. Several tests have shown that the method of filter startup can improve performance lifetime of the filters. The installation must factor in an air inlet for the draining of a filter that does not involve a reverse flow through the filter disks. The reverse flow may cause deformation of the disks or may damage other components of the filters themselves...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of an active rotor system capable of primary control and vibration reduction for rotorcraft. The objective is to investigate the feasibility of a novel Trailing Edge Flap (TEF) actuation system driven by Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs). A significant design effort led to a series of experimental apparatuses which tested various aspects of the performance of the actuators themselves and of TEF systems driven by them. Analytical models were developed in parallel to predict the quasistatic and dynamic behavior of these systems. Initial testing of a prototype blade section with an integrated PAM driven TEF proved the viability of the concept through successful benchtop testing under simulated M = 0. 3 loading and open jet wind tunnel tests under airspeeds up to M = 0. 13. This prototype showed the ability of PAM actuators to generate significant flap deflections over the bandwidth of interest for primary control and vibration reduction on a rotorcraft. It also identified the importance of high pneumatic system mass flow rate for maintaining performance at higher operating frequencies. Research into the development and improvement of PAM actuators centered around a new manufacturing technique which was invented to directly address the weaknesses of previous designs. Detailed finite element model (FEM) analysis of the design allowed for the mitigation of stress concentrations, leading to increased strength. Tensile testing of the swaged actuators showed a factor of safety over 5, and burst pressure testing showed a factor of safety of 3. Over 120, 000, 000 load cycles were applied to the actuators without failure. Characterization testing before, during, and after the fatigue tests showed no reduction in PAM performance. Wind tunnel testing of a full scale Bell 407 blade retrofitted with a PAM TEF system showed excellent control authority. At the maximum wind tunnel test speed of M = 0. 3 and a derated PAM operating pressure of 28 psi, 18. 8 ° half-peak-to-peak flap deflections were achieved at 1 /rev (7 Hz), and 17. 1 ° of half-peak-to-peak flap deflection was still available at 5 /rev (35 Hz). A quasistatic system model was developed which combined PAM forces, kinematics and flap aerodynamics to predict flap deflection amplitudes. This model agreed well with experimental data. Whirl testing of a sub-span whirl rig under full scale loading conditions showed the ability of PAM TEF systems to operate under full scale levels of centrifugal (CF), aerodynamic, and inertia loading. A commercial pneumatic <b>rotary</b> <b>union</b> was used to provide air in the rotating frame. Extrapolation of the results to 100 % of CF acceleration predicts 15. 4 ° of half-peak-to-peak flap deflection at 1 /rev (7 Hz), and 7. 7 ° of half-peak-to-peak flap deflection at 5 /rev (35 Hz). A dynamic model was developed which successfully predicted the time domain behavior of the PAM actuators and PAM TEF system. This model includes control valve dynamics, frictional tubing losses, pressure dynamics, PAM forces, mechanism kinematics, aerodynamic hinge moments, system stiffness, damping, and inertia to solve for the rotational dynamics of the flap. Control system development led to a closed loop control system for PAM TEF systems capable of tracking complex, multi-sinusoid flap deflections representative of a combined primary control and vibration reduction flap actuation scheme. This research shows the promise that PAM actuators have as drivers for trailing edge flaps on active helicopter rotors. The robustness, ease of integration, control authority and tracking accuracy of these actuators have been established, thereby motivating further research...|$|E

From measurements it is well known that overall drag torques of vehicle gearboxes vary significantly over the range of operating points and speeds, de-pending on the interaction of the losses of the single gearbox elements like bearings, gearings, etc. Be-cause today’s vehicle emission regulations are be-coming stricter and stricter "drag torque design " of gearboxes will be even more important in the future.
