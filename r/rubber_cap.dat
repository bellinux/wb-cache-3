40|$|CIVINSThis thesis {{develops}} a 3 -degree of freedom submarine drydock blocking system {{computer aided design}} package. Differential equations of motion are developed {{to take into account}} high blocking systems, wale shores, and side block cap angles. The computer program is verified by a case study involving the earthquake sliding failure of the USS Leahy (CG- 16). A parametric study is conducted {{to determine the effects of}} wale shores, isolators, and block stiffness and geometry variations on system survivability. The effects of using earthquake acceleration time histories with differing frequency spectrums on system survivability is studied. None of eleven submarine drydock blocking systems studied survive to dry dock failure (0. 26 g's) or even meet the Navy's current 0. 2 g survival requirement. This shows that current Navy submarine drydock blocking systems are inadequate to survive expected earthquakes. Two design solutions are found that meet the dry dock failure requirements. The low stiffness solution uses dynamic isolators and <b>rubber</b> <b>caps,</b> and the high stiffness solution uses wale shores and <b>rubber</b> <b>caps.</b> The wale shore solution virtually prevents the submarine from moving horizontally relative to the dock floor. The isolator solution allows relatively large horizontal displacements to occur. Using the wale shore solution, the submarine experiences forces which are an order of magnitude higher than these seen by the isolator solution. Both design solutions can be constructed; however, there are cost and production interference concerns. Theses. (edc) [URL]...|$|R

[...] In an effort to improve reliability, a hard plastic Tenite cap designated T2 was adopted in November 1944 to fit over the feed lips of loaded magazines. [...] These caps protected the feed lips while keeping out dirt, sand, and debris.

30|$|The {{experiment}} {{was set up}} as a two-factor factorial design, with solvent and solvent concentration as factors. When the biomass in precultures reached the exponential growth phase, 48 parts of the culture were taken (100 mL volume) and either limonene, n-decane and n-decanol were added in the necessary amount to obtain the following solvent concentrations (mM): (1) limonene: 123.3, 12.3, 1.2, 0.6, 0.3; (2) n-decane: 513.0, 282.2, 51.3, 28.2, 5.1; (3) n-decanol: 157.3, 15.7, 1.6, 0.8, 0.4. Concentrations were determined based upon literature (Frenz et al. 1989 b; Liu and Mamidipally 2005; Mojaat et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2011 b) and toxicity assays (OECD 1984).

Three replicates, placed in 240 mL flasks with <b>rubber</b> <b>caps,</b> were used for each treatment, totalling 48 runs including three control samples (cultures without solvents).

40|$|In {{the media}} usually {{employed}} for {{the cultivation of}} Trypanosoma cruzi, the portion most favorable {{to the growth of}} this microorganism is the water of condensation formed on blood agar. This fluid is so small in amount that <b>rubber</b> <b>caps</b> are placed on tubes and flasks to conserve it during the incubation of cul-tures. In 1936 Kelser used such a medium for the production of diagnostic anti-gen for Chagas disease and demonstrated that the antigen had merit as a medical tool. However, the necessity of having aseptically drawn blood makes the preparation of large amounts of Kelser's medium difficult. In 1943 Miss Nylah Tom showed that a blood agar medium could be inspis-sated and sterilized in the autoclave at 15 pounds for 20 minutes. This discovery suggested the sequence of experiments by which we were able to arrive at a practical liquid medium for cultivation of Trypanosoma cruzi in large volumes. In this laboratory, Trypanosoma cruzi has been cultivated in 5 -ml, 500 -ml, and 5 -liter volumes in a solution of 2 per cent of peptone, 0. 5 per cent of sodium chloride, and 0. 2 per cent of glucose (pH 7. 5).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the fate and toxicity of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), polyacrylamide and acrylamide monomer in soil under aerobic conditions for mixtures of commercially available products that have application as an anti traction material (ATM) (Southwest Research Institute patent pending for ATM). The aerobic biodegradability of petroleum hydrocarbons in several formulations was determined using a simple microcosm/respirometric method based on carbon dioxide production and TPH depletion. The microcosms consisted of 1 L mason jars fitted with sealed <b>rubber</b> <b>caps</b> that allowed headspace gas samples to be collected in a sealed system. The analytical procedure included the detection of peaks for the compounds in TPH by gas chromatography and identification of peaks with a mass spectrometer (GCMS). Mole fractions of the major components in TPH (undecane, dodecane, tridecane and tetradecane) were calculated from the detected peaks. The extracted soil was analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC) content in order to examine the carbon balance. The method described here provides a simple and inexpensive method for determining the aerobic biodegradability of organics in soil. Results indicated that, for the polyacrylamide (PAM) treatments in soil, there was no significant CO 2 production in the headspace of the microcosm within the experimental time period. Total organic carbon values obtained for the initial and final soil showed no significant PAM biodegradation within a time period of 161 days. This confirms that PAM biodegradation is a slow process and may take several years...|$|R
