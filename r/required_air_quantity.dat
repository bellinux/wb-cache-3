40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a comparative study between Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) and Sedimentation applied to thick the sludges produced in two water treatment plants (WTP) using different coagulants (FeCl 3 and Al 2 (SO 4) 3). Tests were performed using lab scale DAF and sedimentation units (batch). Six types of polymer at different dosages were applied as thickener aids. Also, it was investigated the <b>required</b> <b>air</b> <b>quantity</b> for flotation (A/S). The thickening efficiencies were estimate by means of thickening curves obtained in flotation and gravity column tests. For alum sludge the best results of flotation were obtained applying 4. 5 g/kg TSS of a cationic polymer (with a high molecular weight) with as air/solids ratio (A/S) value around 0. 022. This condition led to a thickened sludge with a Dry Solids Content (DSC) of 7. 1 % w/w. For the flotation using the ferric sludge the best results were obtained applying 6. 8 g/kg TSS of an anionic polymer (with a high molecular weight) and requiring an A/S value around 0. 034. This way resulted in thickened sludge with a DSC of 3. 2 % w/w. This value is higher then the value (1. 6 % w/w) presented by gravity thickening in its best condition. Generally speaking the results showed that comparing with ferric sludge, the alum sludge thickened easier by flotation as well as sedimentation. Furthermore, for both types of sludge the flotation thickening was significantly more efficient than the gravity thickening. Key words: sludge, sludge thickening, sludge flotation, flotation...|$|E
40|$|Auxiliary {{ventilation}} {{refers to}} the systems {{that are used to}} supply fresh air to the working faces in dead end including the use of a push-pull arrangement. There are many advantages of using such a system when compared to other methods. It has been shown that for headings longer than 30 m, auxiliary fans are the only practicable means of delivering the <b>required</b> <b>air</b> <b>quantities.</b> Besides <b>air</b> <b>quantities,</b> <b>air</b> quality is another critical issue for evaluating the ventilation efficiency in underground mines. Forcing and exhausting ducts used in the push-pull system are closely associated with the ventilation efficiency. This paper focuses on the efficiency evaluation for a push-pull ventilation system by using two methods, the dead zone and the mean age of air. By using the CFD technology, the air velocity and air quality are calculated and compared in four different cases. The results of evaluation will be identical by using these two methods. It is concluded that in the push-pull ventilation system, the position of the forcing duct plays a major role on the ventilation efficiency. Also, when the forcing duct position is determined, there must be a particular position of the exhausting duct to provide best ventilation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The current {{trend towards}} the {{adoption}} of retreat longwall mining methods and the associated rapid development of the access drivages has exacerbated the environmental conditions experienced within these workings. The combined use of roof bolt and continuous miner systems has improved the face advance rate within rapid development drivages. In order to maintain adequate dust and gas control {{it is essential that}} the auxiliary ventilation and monitoring systems are correctly installed and maintained. The causes of many potential environmental hazards experienced within auxiliary ventilated rapid development drivages, are often attributed to a failure by the workforce and supervisory officials to maintain the correct installation, maintenance and operational standards of the ventilation and mining systems. The potential ventilation hazards encountered may include: the failure to deliver the <b>required</b> fresh <b>air</b> <b>quantity</b> and velocity to rapidly dilute and disperse methane gas liberated {{in the vicinity of the}} cutting face, or the failure to maintain sufficient exhaust <b>air</b> <b>quantity</b> in the vicinity of the cut to adequately capture dust produced on cutting and loading of the extracted mineral. Results of recent research studies have demonstrated that validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation models can adequately replicate examples of good and bad ventilation. CFD models may be constructed and solved to examine the relative ventilation benefits produced by alternative mining and auxiliary ventilation configurations. These models enable the practitioner to predict and visualise the velocity, pressure and contaminant fields within an auxiliary ventilated drivage. This research project has developed a prototype educational aid, which animates and visualises these airflow and pollutant dispersion patterns within a Virtual Reality (VR) model. By introducing a pollutant such as methane into the CFD models, the VR simulation highlights regions of potential methane concentration build-up to the trainee. The application also allows the user to select/investigate the environmental consequences of enacting a number of remedial actions...|$|R

The AQE is a stand-alone software program that does not require any type of spreadsheet software.

It is difficult to adjust the air-coal parameter of each combustor to a reasonable value according to the static value for no certain relationship between the static value and the air speed is available to calculate the air speed and <b>air</b> <b>quantity.</b> The on-line monitoring system of boiler air-powder computer for real-time monitoring is adopted to keep the boiler {{in a state of}} balanced and steady combustion. The steady and accurate monitoring system and the automatic input rate of boiler (100 %), which could detect the load distribution, pipe blockage, powder interruption and spontaneous combustion accurately, shows considerable value in energy conservation and great practical value in regard to combustion adjustment and reasonable distribution of air and powder.

40|$|Research on {{propeller}} fans in underground drift stone mines {{has shown}} that significant ventilation improvements can be achieved. In large-entry mines {{that do not have}} any high resistance-sections (shafts> 100 ft long or shaft diameters < 12 ft), propeller fans can greatly increase the total system airflow. Propeller fans can be used as either main mine fans or as freestanding auxiliary (jet) fans. NIOSH researchers have documented the performance of two recently installed propeller fans in a working limestone mine (figure 1). Together the fans exhausted 750, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 200. These fans replaced an axial vane main mine fan that produced 300, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 250. The use of the propeller fans more than doubled the <b>air</b> <b>quantity</b> while operating at 50 hp less than the original main mine fan system. In addition, the new fans, when used with effective air-coursing methods such as stoppings, reduced or eliminated recirculation near the face areas. This is because propeller fans are more efficient at lower pressures and can produce large <b>air</b> <b>quantities</b> at lower horsepower requirements than axial vane fans.

30|$|Based {{on the air}} {{distribution}} requirements of the underground ventilation network, an optimization program is introduced, using LINGO optimization software, version 14.0. 1.58. The effect of roof collapse {{and other kinds of}} failure on the stability of mine ventilation system have been studied using a theoretical mine ventilation network. Eight different scenarios were designed to study the effect of mine ventilation topology on the power consumption. This study verified that; a fixed <b>air</b> <b>quantity</b> can be held in the working place by adjusting the amount of regulators in the regulator branches, without any change in the total amount of air delivered to the mine or installing any new regulators. These adjustments in regulators quantities not only deliver the <b>required</b> amount of <b>air</b> to the working places but also reduce the power required through the mine ventilation network. An equation representing the effect of number of branches, number of regulators and power losses through them, on the total power consumption for the network has been given.|$|R
