40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{the vessel}} inscribed {{trigonometry}} (VITM) for the vessel progression orientation (VPO) is {{proposed in the}} two-dimensional fundus image. The VPO {{is a major factor}} in the optic disc (OD) detection which is a basic process in the <b>retina</b> <b>analysis.</b> To measure the VPO, skeletons of vessel are used. First, the vessels are classified into three classes as vessel end, vessel branch and vessel stem. And the chain code maps of VS are generated. Next, two farthest neighborhoods of each point on VS are searched by the proposed angle restriction. Lastly, a gradient of the straight line between two farthest neighborhoods is estimated to measure the VPO. VITM is validated by comparing with manual results and 2 D Gaussian templates. It is confirmed that VPO of the proposed mensuration is correct enough to detect OD from the results of experiment which applied VITM to detect OD in fundus images...|$|E

On the contrary, only M 2 is detectable in controls. Moreover, receptor affinity for agonists is modified by hormone treatment. Since these studies did not show {{whether or not the}} hormone directly influences retinal cells, a similar study was performed on retinal tissue cultures. Cells were treated at day 5 in vitro for 24 hr with 1. 10 (- 8) M corticosterone. Scatchard analysis of results obtained with 3 H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (3 H-QNB) binding showed no difference between treated and control cultures. However, displacement experiments demonstrated that both M 1 and M 2 were present in treated cultures, whereas controls had only M 2. Also, receptor affinity for the agonist carbachol was modified, as already observed with in vivo studies. In addition, a new phenomenon was observed: treated cultures had a significantly higher number of cells. The possibility that the hormone can prevent cell death or stimulate cell mitosis is considered...|$|E
40|$|Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is {{the second}} disease {{diabetes}} which causes blindness in aged people. The only remedy for AMD is intravenous injection of bavecizumab. To prove the efficiency of remedy, the degenerated cells in Macula should be measured. In this article, a modern system is introduced to measure Auto-Fluorescence in Macula part of retina {{in order to obtain}} number of degenerated cells. The system consists of three main parts: Pre-processing stage is omission of margins and reversion of images in <b>retina.</b> <b>Analysis</b> stage is in charge of classification of images and elicitation of their features. In classification the target areas are identified by methods like morphology, dynamic threshold and connected comportments and the features of target area including Euclidean distance to the center of image and density. In the stage of understanding by gathering the features of each class, we will get the measurable parameter of evaluating Auto Fluorescence by the help of which we can count the number of degenerated cells of Macula area. The results are coming from statistical analysis, including linear regression and correlation of data. Experiments have been done on a database of 34 retina images of AMD patients. The average statistical error rate is equal to 76 percent. In clinical reviews, the founded relation to disinflation of Macula has been proved, while there were no proved relations to the vision decreasing or increasing of patients...|$|E
40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that inositol trisphosphate (InsP 3) mediates adaptation and excitation in invertebrate photoreceptors, we measured its formation on a rapid time scale in squid retinas. For squid, excitation and adaption occurs within 0. 1 and 1 - 2 s respectively. We could detect an elevation in InsP 3 within 200 ms of a bright flash. This increase is about 240 % over dark basal levels and is maintained for at least 2 min after a flash. The increase probably occurs in the photoreceptors, which are the only neurons in squid <b>retinas.</b> <b>Analysis</b> by h. p. l. c. indicates that the light-regulated isomer is Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3, which is formed by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PtdInsP 2) ...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the {{extracellular}} matrix protein eyes shut homolog (EYS) cause photoreceptor degeneration {{in patients with}} retinitis pigmentosa 25 (RP 25). Functions of EYS remain poorly understood, {{due in part to}} the lack of an EYS gene in mouse. We investigated the localization of vertebrate EYS proteins and engineered loss-of-function alleles in zebrafish. Immunostaining indicated that EYS localized near the connecting cilium/transition zone in photoreceptors. EYS also strongly localized to the cone outer segments and weakly to the rod outer segments and cone terminals in primate <b>retinas.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of mutant EYS zebrafish revealed disruption of the ciliary pocket in cone photoreceptors, indicating that EYS is required for maintaining the integrity of the ciliary pocket lumen. Mutant zebrafish exhibited progressive loss of cone and rod photoreceptors.

40|$|The {{development}} of retinal implants {{for the blind}} depends crucially on understanding how neurons in the retina respond to electrical stimulation. This study used multielectrode arrays to stimulate ganglion cells in the peripheral macaque retina, which {{is very similar to}} the human <b>retina.</b> <b>Analysis</b> was restricted to parasol cells, which form one of the major high-resolution visual pathways in primates. Individual cells were characterized using visual stimuli, and subsequently targeted for electrical stimulation using electrodes 9 – 15 �m in diameter. Results were accumulated across 16 ON and 9 OFF parasol cells. At threshold, all cells responded to biphasic electrical pulses 0. 05 – 0. 1 ms in duration by firing a single spike with latency lower than 0. 35 ms. The average threshold charge density was 0. 050 � 0. 005 mC/cm 2, significantly below established safety limits for platinum electrodes. ON and OFF ganglion cells were stimulated with similar efficacy. Repetitive stimulation elicited spikes within a 0. 1 ms time window, indicating that the high temporal precision necessary for spike-by-spike stimulation can be achieved in primate retina. Spatial analysis of observed thresholds suggests that electrical activation occurred near the axon hillock, and that dendrites contributed little. Finally, stimulation of a single parasol cell produced little or no activation of other cells in the ON and OFF parasol cell mosaics. The low-threshold, temporally precise, and spatially specific response...|$|E
40|$|Development of the retina, {{like that}} of other tissues, occurs via an orderly {{sequence}} of cell division and differentiation, producing the functional retina. In teleost fish, however, cell division and differentiation in the retina continue throughout {{the life of the}} animal in two distinct ways. Stem cells in a circumferential germinal zone at the periphery of the retina give rise to all retinal cell types and progenitor. cells located throughout the retina in the outer nuclear layer ONL produce new rod photoreceptors. These processes in adult retina recapitulate in space the embryonic events responsible for forming the <b>retina.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of these events in an African cichlid fish, Haplochromis burtoni, confirmed that cone photoreceptors differentiate first, followed by rod photoreceptors. Correspondingly, at the margin of the eye, cone photoreceptors differentiate nearer to the margin than do rods. Control of photoreceptor production is not understood. Here we present the time of appearance and distribution pattern of GABA and vimentin which are candidates for the control of retinal cell division and differentiation. Antibody staining reveals that both GABA and vimentin exhibit unique patterns of expression during embryonic retinal development. Vimentin immunoreactivity is evident throughout the retina in a spoke-like pattern between developmental Days 4 and 7, as both cone and rod photoreceptors are being formed. GABA is expressed in horizontal cells between Days 5 and 7, corresponding to the onset of rod differentiation in time and in position within the retina. Moreover, the wave of GABAergic staining in the horizontal cells parallels the wave of rod differentiation across the embryonic retina of H. burtoni. Thus, GABA may pla...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{variants}} in 10 q 26 are {{in strong}} linkage disequilibrium and {{are associated with}} an increased risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a frequent cause of blindness in developed countries. These variants tag a single-risk haplotype encompassing the genes ARMS 2 (age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2) and part of HTRA 1 (HtrA serine peptidase 1). To define the true AMD susceptibility gene in 10 q 26, several studies have focused on the influence of risk alleles on the expression of ARMS 2 and/or HTRA 1, but the results have been inconsistent. By heterologous expression of genomic ARMS 2 variants, we now show that ARMS 2 mRNA levels transcribed from the risk haplotype are significantly reduced compared with non-risk mRNA isoforms. Analyzing variant ARMS 2 constructs, this effect could specifically be assigned to the known insertion/deletion polymorphism (c. (*) 372 _ 815 del 443 ins 54) in the 3 ′-untranslated region of ARMS 2. Reporter gene assays with HTRA 1 promoter sequences demonstrated the presence of a Müller glia-specific cis-regulatory region further upstream of the transcription start site. However, AMD risk alleles had little or no effect on HTRA 1 promoter activity in the <b>retina.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of a large series of human post-mortem retina/retinal pigment epithelial samples heterozygous for the risk haplotype confirmed the in vitro/ex vivo results and demonstrated that the risk haplotype affects ARMS 2 but not HTRA 1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, we provide in vivo evidence that a common non-risk-associated non-synonymous variant (rs 2736911) also leads to decreased ARMS 2 transcript levels. Consequently, our data suggest that pathogenic effects due to ARMS 2 protein deficiency are unlikely to account for AMD pathology...|$|E

40|$|The {{decussation}} {{patterns of}} retinal ganglion cells in adult pigmented and albino ferrets were determined from {{the distribution of}} cells labelled after large unilateral injections of horseradish peroxidase into the visual pathway, involving the lateral geniculate nucleus and fibres of passage to the superior colliculus. About 6000 retinal ganglion cells project ipsilaterally in pigmented ferrets compared with only about 1500 in albino ferrets. In both strains, {{the vast majority of}} these cells (99 and 87 % in pigmented and albino animals, respectively) are located in the temporal crescent, although we describe one albino ferret in which an aberrant uncrossed projection arises from nasal retina. In pigmented ferrets, there is a sharp nasotemporal division that runs through the area centralis; a small proportion of the ganglion cells in temporal crescent (less than 10 %) does project contralaterally. In albinos, however, the majority of cells in temporal retina project contralaterally. There is no clear nasotemporal division in the albino retina; the density of uncrossed ganglion cells is reduced throughout temporal crescent and at no location exceeds the comparable density of the crossed projection. The peak density within the reduced uncrossed projection is also displaced away from the area centralis into temporal <b>retina.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of cell type on the basis of soma size indicates that whereas large horseradish peroxidase injections into the visual pathway of pigmented ferrets label all types of ganglion cell in the crossed projection, injections restricted to the superior colliculus label only those ganglion cells with large or small somata. The distribution of cell sizes in the crossed projection from temporal retina is biased towards small cells in the pigmented ferret but in albinos resembles that seen in the crossed projection from nasal retina. Thus the adult pigmented ferret has both a well developed nasotemporal division in which decussation lines are obvious in the crossed and uncrossed pathways and also, unlike rodents but like cats, a class of ganglion cell that does not project to the superior colliculus. The albino mutation both reduces the uncrossed projection throughout temporal retina, although the reduction is greatest close to the area centralis, and also commensurately increases the crossed projection from temporal retina...|$|E

40|$|SummaryDuring development, retinal axons project {{coarsely}} {{within their}} visual targets before refining to form organized synaptic connections. Spontaneous retinal activity, {{in the form}} of acetylcholine-driven retinal waves, is proposed to be necessary for establishing these projection patterns. In particular, both axonal terminations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the size of receptive fields of target neurons are larger in mice that lack the β 2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (β 2 KO). Here, using a large-scale, high-density multielectrode array to record activity from hundreds of RGCs simultaneously, we present analysis of early postnatal retinal activity from both wild-type (WT) and β 2 KO retinas. We find that β 2 KO retinas have correlated patterns of activity, but many aspects of these patterns differ from those of WT <b>retina.</b> Quantitative <b>analysis</b> suggests that wave directionality, coupled with short-range correlated bursting patterns of RGCs, work together to refine retinofugal projections...|$|R

To explore the developmental role of this arrangement, we studied formation of the retina and its projections in Cyp 26 a 1 null-mutant mice. Expression of several dorsoventral markers was not affected, indicating that CYP 26 A 1 is not required for establishing the dorsoventral <b>retina</b> axis. <b>Analysis</b> of the mutation on a RA-reporter mouse background confirmed, as expected, that the RA-poor stripe was missing in the retina and its projections {{at the time when}} the optic axons first grow over the diencephalon. A day later, however, a gap appeared both in retina and retinofugal projections. As explanation, we found that CYP 26 C 1, another RA-degrading enzyme, had emerged centrally in a narrower domain within the RA-poor stripe. While RA applications increased retinal Cyp 26 a 1 expression, they slightly reduced Cyp 26 c 1. These observations indicate that the two enzymes function independently. The safeguard of the RA-poor stripe by two distinct enzymes during later development points to a role in maturation of a significant functional feature like an area of higher visual acuity that develops at its location...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The retinal {{vasculature}} is {{a capillary}} network {{of blood vessels}} that nourishes the inner retina of most mammals. Developmental abnormalities or microvascular complications in the retinal vasculature result in severe human eye diseases that lead to blindness. To exploit the advantages of zebrafish for genetic, developmental and pharmacological studies of retinal vasculature, we characterised the intraocular vasculature in zebrafish. Results We show a detailed morphological and developmental analysis of the retinal blood supply in zebrafish. Similar to the transient hyaloid vasculature in mammalian embryos, vessels are first found attached to the zebrafish lens at 2. 5 days post fertilisation. These vessels progressively lose contact with the lens and by 30 days post fertilisation adhere to the inner limiting membrane of the juvenile <b>retina.</b> Ultrastructure <b>analysis</b> shows these vessels to exhibit distinctive hallmarks of mammalian retinal vasculature. For example, smooth muscle actin-expressing pericytes are ensheathed by the basal lamina of the blood vessel, and vesicle vacuolar organelles (VVO), subcellular mediators of vessel-retinal nourishment, are present. Finally, we identify 9 genes with cell membrane, extracellular matrix and unknown identity that are necessary for zebrafish hyaloid and retinal vasculature development. Conclusion Zebrafish have a retinal blood supply with a characteristic developmental and adult morphology. Abnormalities of these intraocular vessels are easily observed, enabling application of genetic and chemical approaches in zebrafish to identify molecular regulators of hyaloid and retinal vasculature in development and disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMutation of {{the glass}} onion locus causes drastic {{neuronal}} patterning defects in the zebrafish retina and brain. The precise stratified appearance of the wild-type retina is absent in the mutants. The glass onion phenotype is first visible shortly after the formation of optic primordia and {{is characterized by the}} rounding of cells and disruption of the ventricular surface in the eye and brain neuroepithelia. With exception of the dorsal- and ventral-most regions of the brain, neuroepithelial cells lose their integrity and begin to distribute ectopically. At later stages, the laminar patterning of retinal neurons is severely disrupted. Despite the lack of lamination, individual retinal cell classes differentiate in the glass onion <b>retina.</b> Mosaic <b>analysis</b> reveals that the glass onion mutation acts cell nonautonomously within the retina and brain, as neuroepithelial cell morphology and polarity in these tissues are normal when mutant cells develop in wild-type hosts. We conclude that the glass onion mutation affects cell–cell signaling event(s) involved in the maintenance of the neuroepithelial cell layer shortly after its formation. The disruption of neuroepithelial integrity may be the cause of the neuronal patterning defects following neurogenesis. In addition, the expression {{of the glass}} onion phenotype in a subset of neuroepithelial cells as well as its onset following the initial formation of the neuroepithelial sheets indicate the presence of genetically distinct temporal and spatial subdivisions in the development of this histologically uniform tissue...|$|R
40|$|During axon targeting, a stereotyped {{pattern of}} {{connectivity}} is achieved by the integration of intrinsic genetic programs and the response to extrinsic long and short-range directional cues. How this coordination occurs {{is the subject of}} intense study. Transcription factors play a central role due to their ability to regulate the expression of multiple genes required to sense and respond to these cues during development. Here we show that the transcription factor HNT regulates layer-specific photoreceptor axon targeting in Drosophila through transcriptional control of jbug/Filamin and multiple genes involved in axon guidance and cytoskeleton organization. Using a microarray analysis we identified 235 genes whose expression levels were changed by HNT overexpression in the eye primordia. We analyzed nine candidate genes involved in cytoskeleton regulation and axon guidance, six of which displayed significantly altered gene expression levels in hnt mutant <b>retinas.</b> Functional <b>analysis</b> confirmed the role of OTK/PTK 7 in photoreceptor axon targeting and uncovered Tiggrin, an integrin ligand, and Jbug/Filamin, a conserved actin- binding protein, as new factors that participate of photoreceptor axon targeting. Moreover, we provided in silico and molecular evidence that supports jbug/Filamin as a direct transcriptional target of HNT and that HNT acts partially through Jbug/Filamin in vivo to regulate axon guidance. Our work broadens the understanding of how HNT regulates the coordinated expression of a group of genes to achieve the correct connectivity pattern in the Drosophila visual system. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|The paper {{tries to}} improve the {{accuracy}} of eccentric photorefraction by taking more information into account than just the size and tilt of the crescent. Based on Gaussian optics and the assumption of an isotropic scattering <b>retina,</b> a theoretical <b>analysis</b> of the light intensity distribution in the pupil of astigmatic eyes is presented. The method is applied to different photorefractor setups (point light source, long linear light source, knife edge aperture, circular aperture). In {{the case of a}} knife edge aperture, the crescent structure can be formulated analytically. In the case of a circular aperture, an analytic description is possible only for spherical refractive errors, but astigmatic refractive errors can be determined from crescent parameters with neural networks. 1 Introduction Eccentric photorefraction (EPR) is an objective refraction technique which allows one to determine refractive errors in human and animal eyes from a distance of typically 0 : 5 Γ 5 m. It is used as [...] ...|$|R
