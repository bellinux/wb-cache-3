2500|$|The Hornet, {{introduced}} for the 1951 model year, {{was based}} on Hudson's [...] "step-down" [...] design that was first seen in the 1948 model year on the Commodore. The design merged body and chassis frame into a single structure, with the floor pan <b>recessed</b> <b>between</b> the car's chassis rails instead of {{sitting on top of}} them. Thus one [...] "stepped down" [...] into a Hudson. The step-down chassis's [...] "lower center of gravity...was both functional and stylish.

2500|$|The AMC Cavalier also {{featured}} curved sides, as if a fuselage, punctuated by full wheel arches and riding on [...] "mag" [...] wheels with whitewall tires.

The rear window was <b>recessed</b> <b>between</b> the C pillars, making back area look similar to that of the General Motors' 1966-1967 [...] "A" [...] body platform two-door models, such as the Chevrolet Chevelle and Pontiac GTO. The swept-back panels and roof were covered in black vinyl to enhance the car's deep red metallic body finish.|$|E

40|$|The {{authors have}} made the {{practice}} of physical activity at <b>recess</b> <b>between</b> class-lessons during a {{last year with the}} objects of developing the physical fitness and cultivating the spirit of independency and co-operation of pupils. We really hope that the children not only make progress in motor skills but also complete their personalities through these physical activities which they create by themselves and play together. Therefore, these physical activities are not merely played at <b>recess</b> <b>between</b> lessons but desirable to permeate into school life and social livings. The authors believe firmly that the physical activity at <b>recess</b> <b>between</b> class-lessons obtained fairly good results as an effective means to attain the above-mentioned purposes...|$|R

30|$|Affected joints {{should be}} {{compared}} to contralateral asymptomatic joints. In {{the evaluation of the}} hip joint, the anterior synovial <b>recess</b> (<b>between</b> the iliofemoral ligament anteriorly and the femoral neck posteriorly) is measured [248].
