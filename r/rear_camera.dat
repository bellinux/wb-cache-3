25|$|Although {{the plot}} and central {{characters}} mostly remain unchanged, many gameplay elements {{from the original}} have been tweaked for the DualShock 4 controller. For instance, touch-based elements in the original game have been re-mapped and modified for use on PlayStation 4. The creation aspects, where players used the touchscreen to draw objects that would appear in game, are now used on the DualShock's touchpad. Alternatively, the player may use the PlayStation Camera or the PlayStation App to input their drawings. The latter options {{can also be used}} to input a real world texture or colour into the game, a feature previously dedicated to the Vita's <b>rear</b> <b>camera.</b> Along with new creation methods, the touchpad is used for interacting with the world. Certain platforms require the player to grab, hold, or drag them off the environment for use. The player can also use the touchpad to create a blast of wind, which can swipe enemies away and blow down extra platforms for use.|$|E
500|$|Speculation in {{the general}} public and media outlets {{regarding}} the handset's specifications began gathering momentum several months before its formal unveiling in May 2012. In February 2012, prior to the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain, there were rumors that the handset would incorporate a 1.5GHz quad-core processor, a display of 1080p (1080×1920 pixels) resolution, a 12-megapixel <b>rear</b> <b>camera</b> and a HD Super AMOLED Plus touchscreen. More accurate rumored specifications included 2GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, 4G LTE, a [...] screen, an 8-megapixel <b>rear</b> <b>camera,</b> and a [...] thick chassis. Samsung confirmed the existence of the Galaxy SII's successor on 5 March 2012, {{but it was not until}} late April 2012 that Samsung's Senior Vice-President Robert Yi confirmed the phone to be called [...] "Samsung Galaxy SIII".|$|E

The 0.3 MP front camera shoots VGA-quality 30 frame/s video and VGA-quality still photos. The 0.7 MP back camera can shoot 720p HD video at 30 frame/s and has a 5× times digital zoom. Both shoot photo in a [...] fullscreen aspect ratio.

500|$|The Dream's {{exterior}} uses a soft, matte plastic shell, and {{was made}} available in white, black, and bronze colors. The Dream's design features a distinctive [...] "chin" [...] on the bottom, which houses 5 navigation buttons ("Call", [...] "Home", [...] "Menu", [...] "Back", and [...] "End Call") and a clickable trackball {{in the center}} {{which can be used}} for scrolling and selecting. The device uses a [...] capacitive touchscreen LCD at a resolution of 320×480; the screen can be slid along a curved hinge to expose a five-row QWERTY keyboard—as the first releases of Android did not include a virtual keyboard, the keyboard was originally the only method of text input on the device. While supporting multitouch at the hardware level, the Linux kernel in the Dream's Android distribution was patched to remove multitouch support from its touchscreen drivers for undisclosed reasons. The Dream does not include a traditional headphone jack, requiring an adapter for HTC's proprietary (but Mini-USB compatible) [...] "ExtUSB" [...] port located {{on the bottom of the}} device. The rear of the device houses a 3.15-megapixel <b>rear</b> <b>camera</b> with auto-focus.|$|E
500|$|LG's Android {{interface}} design received mixed reviews; TechRadar gave it {{a positive}} review, describing it as being [...] "easy enough for novice and expert smartphone users alike", and noting its dynamic elements and customization features. [...] Its increased customization abilities (including different lock screen and home screen animations, {{and the ability to}} change the background and layout of the on-screen navigation buttons) was noted by reviewers. The usefulness of the [...] "Slide Aside" [...] feature was questioned due to the availability of other, more efficient means to switch apps. LG's software was generally panned for being unpolished in places, suffering from feature creep, and containing too many unneeded visual effects and skeuomorphic elements (the latter having generally fallen out of favor). The G2's software was also panned for containing usability digressions in comparison to stock Android, such as the notification tray being taken up by options, not using Android 4.2's updated [...] "Complete action using" [...] menu and behavior, and, despite using on-screen buttons, continued use of the [...] "Menu" [...] key which was officially deprecated by Google in its Android human interface guidelines for Android 4.x (on apps which comply with the HIG, overflow menus are intended to be displayed within the apps themselves. The device's Menu key is replaced by a [...] "Recent apps" [...] key, and a small [...] "Menu" [...] key appears to the side when needed). The Nexus 5 was released by LG shortly afterwards and shares much of the G2's hardware albeit with a lower-quality <b>rear</b> <b>camera</b> and smaller battery to hit a lower price point; the Nexus 5 has been touted as a clean Android software alternative with the added advantage of running the latest Android 4.4 [...] "KitKat" [...] while the G2 had to make do with a bloatware-filled Android 4.2.2 [...] "Jelly Bean" [...] for a time.|$|E

It launched with a US$199 retail price.|$|E
2500|$|Reception of the iPhone 7 was mixed. Although reviewers {{noted the}} {{improvements}} to the camera, especially the dual <b>rear</b> <b>camera</b> on the Plus model, they also stated that the iPhone 7 did not make significant changes to the display or build quality, where competing flagship smartphones surpassed {{the quality of the}} iPhone 7. Many reviews highlighted the controversial removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary Lightning connector and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for Phil Schiller's statement that such a drastic change required [...] "courage".|$|E
2500|$|Similarly to the {{previous}} model, the device's rear-facing camera received mixed reviews. While it received praise for its low-light capabilities, faster autofocus, along with the updates to HTC's camera software, the camera was criticized for not showing any notable improvements in image quality over {{the previous}} model, producing soft-looking images that only looked acceptable at small sizes due to aggressive noise-reduction and inadequate software processing. In addition, the M8's <b>rear</b> <b>camera</b> lacked optical image stabilization (OIS) which {{had been found in}} the proceeding M7. However, Engadget praised HTC's focus on [...] "selfies" [...] with its 5-megapixel front-facing camera, and The Verge quipped that even its [...] "ultimate selfie machine" [...] took better photos than the rear-facing camera in many situations. The Duo Camera functionality received similarly mixed reaction; while critics felt that the effects could be considered fun and useful by end-users, the effects themselves (particularly the refocus effect) were panned for not having any positive effect on overall image quality, and for having inconsistent quality themselves. Ars Technica specifically considered the Duo Camera to be [...] "poorly executed gimmicks", noting that the effect could be replicated in software and that HTC should have instead focused on improving the hardware of the <b>rear</b> <b>camera.</b> Anand Lal Shimpi of AnandTech praised {{the look and feel of}} the device, Sense 6.0, and the better power efficiency with the Snapdragon 801. Anand also praised the camera app and UI, as well as the effects processing such as the zoom and blur features, stating that the device was [...] "an extremely versatile shooter," [...] but noted deficiencies, such as the inadequate image quality and lack of image stabilization. Ultimately, he stated that the new HTC One [...] "is an upgrade in so many areas, but lacked a substantial step forward in primary camera quality." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Mk I PR Type G was {{the first}} fighter-reconnaissance version and {{performed}} a similar low-level tactical role to the Type E.
