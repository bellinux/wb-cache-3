500|$|Bill Janovitz of Allmusic {{describes}} the music as beautiful, with folk guitar chord changes and a somber melody, while the chorus, with its line [...] "and it's all over now, Baby Blue" [...] has a heartbreaking quality to it. Like other Dylan {{songs of the}} period, such as [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the lyrics of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] bear the strong influence of Symbolist poets such as Arthur Rimbaud. Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.' [...] It was one of the songs I used to sing back in high school. Of course, I was singing about a different Baby Blue." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{certainly}} {{had an enormous}} influence on me [...] I <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I was Generalmusikdirektor in Aachen, a friend invited me to a concert that Furtwängler gave in Cologne [...] Furtwängler's performance of the Schumann's Fourth, which I didn't know at the time, opened up a new world for me. I was deeply impressed. I didn't want to forget this concert, so I immediately returned to Aachen.|$|E
2500|$|Later on as his Motown career developed, Gaye {{would seek}} {{inspiration}} in fellow label mates such as David Ruffin of The Temptations and Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops as their grittier voices led to Gaye and his producer seeking a similar sound in recordings such as [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] and [...] "That's the Way Love Is". Later in his life, Gaye {{reflected on the}} influence of Ruffin and Stubbs stating, [...] "I had heard something in their voices something my own voice lacked". He further explained, [...] "the Tempts and Tops' music made me <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a lot of women listen to music, they want to feel the power of a real man." ...|$|E

6000|$|Cecily. How thoughtless of me. I {{should have}} <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{one is going}} to lead an entirely new life, one {{requires}} regular and wholesome meals. Won't you come in? ...|$|R
2500|$|... where by [...] we {{mean the}} {{operator}} [...] {{but with the}} reverse factor ordering (remember from simple quantum mechanics where the product of operators is reversed under conjugation). We evaluate the action of this operator on the Wilson loop as a calculation in the connection representation and rearranging the result as a manipulation purely in terms of loops (one should <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> considering the action on the Wilson loop one should choose the operator one wishes to transform with the opposite factor ordering to the one chosen for its action on wavefunctions [...] ). This gives the physical meaning of the operator [...] For example, if [...] corresponded to a spatial diffeomorphism, then this {{can be thought of}} as keeping the connection field [...] of [...] where it is while performing a spatial diffeomorphism on [...] instead. Therefore, the meaning of [...] is a spatial diffeomorphism on , the argument of [...]|$|E
2500|$|To find {{how many}} days the civil {{calendar}} is ahead of the Julian in any year from 301 BCE (the calendar is proleptic [...] up to 1582 CE) add 300 to the year, multiply the hundreds by 7, divide by 9 and subtract 4. Ignore any fraction of a day. When {{the difference between the}} calendars changes the calculated value applies on and from March 1 (civil date) for conversions to Julian. For earlier dates reduce the calculated value by one. For conversions to the civil date the calculated value applies on and from February 29 (Julian date). Again, for earlier dates reduce the calculated value by one. The difference is applied to the calendar one is converting into. A negative value indicates that the Julian date is ahead of the civil date. In this case it is important to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> calculating the civil equivalent of February 29 (Julian), February 29 is discounted. Thus if the calculated value is −4 the civil equivalent of this date is February 24. Before 1 CE use astronomical years rather than years BCE. The astronomical year is (year BCE) – 1.|$|E

6000|$|She {{paused and}} Mrs. Winter <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> she had shown the girl the old {{newspaper}} Carrie had {{hesitated for a}} moment or two. She, however, said nothing and Carrie resumed: ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, and we {{are going}} to journey from winter into summer,” added Phil. “It’s good we <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> we packed our suit-cases. At first I was going to put in nothing but heavy clothing.” ...|$|R
60|$|There was a sparkle of indignation in Helen's eyes, and a {{suspicion}} of tell-tale color in her face. She <b>remembered</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> {{he first met}} her mother, her father's position much resembled Thurston's, and the girl wondered if he desired to remind her of it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' said John, 'I don't know--I am sure--I <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I went up last, he HAD put {{the lights}} upon the mantel-shelf.' ...|$|E

60|$|He now {{distinctly}} <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{he entered}} Massie's office {{a man by}} the name of Jared Thompson, formerly an old neighbor of his, was there, and that his first words were to the effect that he had brought the money to pay off the mortgage.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{must have}} <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> she was last {{here he was}} of the party, and it was but a few weeks ago,--only a little before Christmas. He struck me as being cold in his manner as an affianced lover. Was not that your idea, Lady Penwether?" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{made the}} thing {{a bit more}} plausible. I <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I had arrived in America about a year before, the {{proceedings}} had begun at some ghastly hour like six, and that I had been shot out on to a foreign shore considerably before eight.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's very true," [...] replied Mrs. Parkman. [...] "Do {{you hear}} that, William? You must <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{you are going}} to change the plans without asking my consent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} defend myself for {{accepting}} you at last. But you must <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I did so I said that I should go--back--to him, {{if he could}} take me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Elisabeth," [...] he said, [...] "I {{am afraid}} that {{there is very little}} hope of our coming to any agreement. You must <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I promised to come here--" ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{should be}} <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> André Breton {{included}} the question [...] "Suicide: Is It a Solution?" [...] {{in the first}} issue of La Révolution surréaliste in 1925, Crevel {{was one of those who}} answered [...] "Yes". He wrote [...] "It is most probably the most correct and most ultimate solution." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thought {{it would}} do her good to model {{something}} strong and natural. She'll never amount to anything if she keeps on making namby-pamby gods and pet kittens,' answered irreverent Dan, <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he was last here Bess was vibrating distractedly between a head of Apollo and her Persian cat as models.|$|R
50|$|On {{the fifth}} day, finding himself still alive, he <b>remembers</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{his mother was}} dying {{she asked him to}} stop praying for her as his prayers were keeping her alive and she was in pain. When he stopped praying, her soul became a cloud of smoke which {{appeared}} over her grave. As it turns out, Nassar-Ali's youngest son is praying for him.|$|R
60|$|We {{unloaded}} {{the canoe}} and ate. Bastin's appetite was splendid. Indeed, I {{had to ask}} him to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> this supply was done I did not know where we should find any more.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would in}} any case be my own brave sister," [...] he said gently, [...] "who would <b>remember</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> France is in peril, {{it is not for}} her sons to turn their backs on her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So he was, {{but then}} they always had a great affection for him, {{although}} he had so many eccentricities. You <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the weather was the least cold, {{he would try to}} come into the house." ...|$|E

5000|$|Producer Brian Grazer <b>remembers</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Val Kilmer {{came in to}} {{audition}} {{for the role of}} Chris Knight, he brought candy bars and performed tricks. Kilmer remembered it differently. [...] "The character wasn't polite, so when I shook Grazer's hand and he said, 'Hi, I'm the producer,' I said, 'I'm sorry. You look like you're 12 years old. I like to work with men.'" ...|$|R
50|$|Seth <b>remembers</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he was eight, he {{was left}} alone {{in a house with}} his four-year-old brother, Owen. An escaped convict from a nearby prison kidnapped Owen for three days, leaving him with {{psychological}} damage and prompting the family to move to America. The recollections also show that Seth is gay and in a relationship, though he and his boyfriend were forced to break up after being outed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This {{reminds me}} of the story of the great bear, the medium bear, and the little ditto,' {{observed}} Montgomery, who was apt at an analogy. 'You may <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the great bear found his porridge tampered with, he--' ...|$|E
60|$|Finally, I <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I {{got into}} my little bedroom, I was truly wretched, {{and had a}} strong {{conviction}} on me that I should never like Joe's trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is thine own, I trow," [...] {{said the}} Princess,--"not thy groom's? I <b>remember,</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> thy brave father brought my lord and me back from our bridal at Burgos, he {{procured}} two hounds in the Pyrenees, of meseems, such a breed." ...|$|E
60|$|And Nod <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the Gunga-mulgar had led {{him down}} out of his huddle to show him the Bobberie, the moon was shining then at dwindling halves. So he knew that, unless many days had passed since then, it would be some while yet before these Minimuls made their cannibal Moon-feast. He lay still, with eyes half shut, {{thinking}} as best he could, with an aching head and throbbing shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Finally, {{it must be}} <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the History was {{published}} in 1758, Lord Orrery was still living. If the work were a forgery, why did not Lord Orrery expose it? Nothing would have pleased him more. He had read the manuscript {{referred to in the}} Correspondence. He had carried it to Oxford and given it to King, at Swift's request. He knew all about it, and he said nothing.|$|R
2500|$|Madelyn Dunham (née Madelyn Lee Payne) was Obama's {{maternal}} {{grandmother who}} worked in banking and became vice president of a bank in Hawaii.
