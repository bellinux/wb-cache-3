Samples with texturing on both sides together with white paint as a <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> reflector show very good light trapping properties, but also other rear reflector configurations with diffuse scatterers, like e. g.

40|$|Simple diffuse rear reflectors {{can enhance}} the light path length of weakly absorbed near {{infrared}} light in silicon solar cells and set a benchmark for more complex and expensive light trapping structures like dielectric gratings or plasmonic particles. We analyzed such simple diffuse rear reflectors systematically by optical and electrical measurements. We applied white paint, TiO 2 nanoparticles, white backsheets and a silver mirror to bifacial silicon solar cells and measured the enhancement of the external quantum efficiency for three different solar cell geometries: planar front and <b>rear</b> <b>side,</b> textured front and planar <b>rear</b> <b>side,</b> and textured front and <b>rear</b> <b>side.</b> We showed that an air-gap between the solar cell and the reflector decreases the absorption enhancement significantly, thus white paint and TiO 2 nanoparticles directly applied to the rear cell surface lead to the highest short circuit current density enhancements. The short circuit current density gains for a 200 mu m thick planar solar cell reached up to 1. 8 mA/cm(2), compared to a non-reflecting black <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> and up to 0. 8 mA/cm(2) compared to a high-quality silver mirror <b>rear</b> <b>side.</b> For solar cells with textured front side the short circuit current density gains {{are in the range}} between 0. 5 and 1. 0 mA/cm(2) compared to a non-reflecting black <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> and do not significantly depend on the angular characteristic of the <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> reflector but mainly on its absolute reflectance...|$|R

Two types of diffractive structures, hexagonal sphere gratings and binary gratings have been simulated and fabricated. For both structures absorption enhancements corresponding to a photo current density gain of 1 - 2 mA/cm 2 have been verified in optical measurements. To integrate these diffractive structures into fully processed silicon solar cells, we developed a passivation concept using a thin Al 2 O 3 layer that provides a high-quality passivation for the <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> of the active silicon bulk and has a negligible influence on the optical properties.

40|$|<b>Rear</b> <b>side</b> {{hexagonal}} sphere gratings {{are demonstrated}} as diffractive structures that enhance the light path length {{in the near}} infrared, where crystalline silicon solar cells suffer from weak absorption. Moreover, the <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> sphere grating can be added behind a solar cell with flat rear surface, giving an “electrically flat but optically rough” device with high efficiency potential. Here, a thin passivating tunnel-contact layer electrically separates the sphere grating from the cell's base. Solar cells with the <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> sphere grating have obtained a VOC of up to 710 mV and a FF of up to 81. 9 %. External quantum efficiency measurements show a current density gain of 1. 4 mA/cm 2 due to the sphere grating. This leads to an overall efficiency of up to 22. 1 % for the solar cells with planar front <b>side</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> sphere grating. Estimates for perovskite–silicon and III/V-silicon tandem devices show that the efficiency of tandems can be enhanced by up to 2. 4 % absolute with a sphere grating on the <b>rear</b> <b>side.</b> Thus, sphere gratings could improve Si-based tandem devices that are limited due to a low current in the Si bottom cell...|$|R
