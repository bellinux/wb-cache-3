5|$|The {{earthquake}}'s {{effects were}} felt {{as far north}} as Lebanon and Syria and it was the strongest event in the Jordan Rift Valley since the 1927 Jericho earthquake which was centered near the Dead Sea. The heaviest damage occurred in the <b>resort</b> <b>town</b> of Eilat where seven hotels and 50 other buildings were damaged, and cracks formed in the sidewalks. Fifteen people were treated there for injuries or shock and one man {{died of a heart attack}} in Aqaba. In Saudi Arabia two women were reported dead and five deaths were reported in Egypt, with three of them occurring in the gulf <b>resort</b> <b>town</b> of Nuweiba. Eight buildings collapsed in Cairo where, just several years before, the much smaller 1992 Cairo earthquake had a much more destructive impact.

In addition, business generated by <b>resort</b> <b>towns</b> have been credited with supporting the local economy through times of national market failure and depression, {{as in the case}} of San Marcos, California during the cotton market bust in the early 1920s and Great Depression of 1929.|$|R

Furthermore, the villages of Searchlight and Blue Diamond were isolated due to flooding. Several major streets in Paradise were closed because of flooding and sandbag barriers were erected alongside Caesars Palace to prevent further flood damage.

5|$|Several {{areas of}} Bath had {{undergone}} development during the Stuart period, and development increased during Georgian times {{in response to}} the increasing number of visitors to the spa and <b>resort</b> <b>town</b> who required accommodation. The architects John Wood, the Elder and his son John Wood, the Younger laid out the new quarters in streets and squares, the identical façades of which gave an impression of palatial scale and classical decorum. Much of the creamy gold Bath stone used for construction throughout the city was obtained from the limestone Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, which were owned by Ralph Allen (1694–1764).|$|E
50|$|The {{revenues}} amassed from tourism {{typically do}} not benefit {{the host country}} or the local communities. Income to local communities generated by tourism are all of the expenditures accrued after taxes, profits, and wages are paid out; however, around 80% of traveler's expenditures go to airlines, hotels, and international companies, not to local businesses. These funds {{are referred to as}} leakages. Tourism has also been blamed for other negative economic impacts to local communities. Although <b>resort</b> <b>towns</b> usually boast more improved infrastructure than surrounding areas, these developments usually present high costs to local governments and tax payers. Reallocating government funds to subsidize infrastructure and tax breaks to firms shift available funding to local education and health services. In addition, <b>resort</b> <b>towns</b> typically do not have dynamic economies, resulting in an over dependence on one industry. Economic dependence on tourism poses particular challenges to <b>resort</b> <b>towns</b> and its local residents given the seasonal nature of the job market in some areas. Local residents of <b>resort</b> <b>towns</b> face job insecurity, difficulties in obtaining training, medical-benefits, and housing.|$|R

5|$|Some municipalities, {{particularly}} in South Jersey, are dry towns where no alcohol can be legally served or sold. Some {{of them are}} dry because of their origins as Quaker, Methodist, or other Protestant religious communities. For example, the seaside <b>resort</b> <b>town</b> of Ocean City has been dry since {{it was founded in}} 1879 by four Methodist clergymen. In recent years, several municipalities have questioned whether they ought to remain dry. Dry towns frequently have public referendums on whether they should remain dry or allow liquor sales in order to attract new businesses and increase property tax revenue.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century revived {{interest}} in Cofresí's piracy {{as a tourist}} attraction, with municipalities in Puerto Rico highlighting their historical connection to the pirates. By {{the second half of}} the century, beaches and sports teams (especially in his native Cabo Rojo, which features a monument in his honor) were named for him; in the Dominican Republic, a <b>resort</b> <b>town</b> was named after the pirate. Cofresí's name has been commercialized, with a number of products and businesses adopting it and its associated legends. Puerto Rico's first flag carrier seaplane was named for him.

The flight on 3 September 1978, Sunday afternoon, from Kariba to Salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers, {{most of whom were}} holidaymakers from Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake.
