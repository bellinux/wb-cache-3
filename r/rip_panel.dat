5000|$|Another of Wise's {{innovations}} was the <b>rip</b> <b>panel</b> for controlled deflation on landing. Prior to Wise's {{use of the}} <b>rip</b> <b>panel,</b> balloons would drag {{along the}} ground when landing {{and had to be}} secured by anchors and lines. Balloonists wishing to deflate their balloons would climb out of their baskets onto the netting surrounding the balloon, and having scaled {{to the top of the}} balloon would open the valve to allow the gas to escape. The weight of the balloonist would cause the balloon to collapse inwards and there had been a number of accidents where the balloonists had been killed after becoming entangled in the rigging. Wise also recognised that the heat from the sun played a valuable role in warming the gas in the balloon, and built a black balloon to utilize the effects. He was the first to observe the jet stream, noting there was a [...] "great river of air which always blows from west to east". On August 17, 1859 he made the first flight of local airmail in the U.S. from Lafayette, Indiana to Crawfordsville, Indiana in a balloon named Jupiter, [...] carrying 123 letters and 23 circulars of which one cover was discovered in 1957.His trip of 25 miles ended when he was forced to land by lack of buoyancy.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{launches}} {{were scheduled}} for the first day. Each launch required someone to pull a canvas <b>rip</b> <b>panel,</b> releasing the balloon, while four people guided the chair and camera rig across the ground to a position underneath the rising balloon. The first rig partially collapsed on take-off, but it remained intact enough to rise for over 82 minutes, reaching a height of 98,268 ft before the balloon shattered and the rig fell for around {{half an hour before}} hitting ground. At one point during the ascent, telemetry from the rig recorded a temperature of [...] before the air became too thin to dissipate heat effectively and the temperature rose again. The cameras on both of the first two rigs were offline, but usable footage was recovered from the second launch, albeit slightly overexposed. Two additional launches were made the following day, with the fourth re-capturing footage unrecoverable from previous launches. Despite the four balloons reaching heights of 98268 ft, 93000 ft, 94000 ft and 82000 ft all of the rigs and cameras were recovered within twelve miles (12 mi) of the launch site. The launch reaching 98,268 ft set a new world record for Highest High-Definition Television Commercial. In all, 16 hours of footage were recorded and handed to The Mill for post production. Knowing that many viewers would suspect the piece was constructed from computer-generated imagery, imperfections such as the supporting wires and spots of lens dust were left in to lend an air of authenticity.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} the wind abated greatly, and small, infrequent snowflakes came drifting by. Snow also spread more abundantly below, {{and the only}} trees were clumps of pine and spruce in the lower valleys. Kurt went with three men into the still intact gas-chambers, let out a certain quantity of gas from them, and prepared a series of <b>ripping</b> <b>panels</b> for the descent. Also the residue of the bombs and explosives in the magazine were thrown overboard and fell, detonating loudly, in the wilderness below. And about four o'clock in {{the afternoon}} upon a wide and rocky plain within sight of snow-crested cliffs, the Vaterland ripped and grounded.|$|R
50|$|After {{the wreck}} of No.5 Santos Dumont {{immediately}} started work on a replacement, which was finished by September 1. Similar to the No.5 but slightly larger, it had an envelope of varnished silk from which an elongated uncovered gondola was suspended by steel wires. The envelope was fitted with a single manoeuvering valve and two automatic pressure-relief valves: in addition there were two <b>ripping</b> <b>panels</b> to enable hydrogen to be rapidly vented in an emergency. The triangular section gondola was constructed of lengths of pine connected with aluminium sockets and braced with piano wire. The 12 hp (9 kW) engine was mounted in {{the centre of the}} gondola and drove a two-bladed pusher propeller at the rear via a long driveshaft. The pilot stood in a small balloon basket at the front. The triangular rudder was carried between the rear of the gondola and the envelope.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the tornado}} hit, a SEC tournament game between Mississippi State and Alabama which {{had just been}} sent into {{overtime}} minutes earlier by a shot from Mykal Riley, was in progress at the Georgia Dome. [...] The storm <b>ripped</b> <b>panels</b> from {{the exterior of the}} building and tore at least two holes in the roof of the Dome, causing insulation to fall and the scoreboard and catwalks suspended from the roof to sway. [...] Mykal Riley's shot was considered to have saved lives by keeping people safe inside the Georgia Dome. [...] After a 64-minute delay, the game was completed, however the next scheduled game between Kentucky and Georgia was postponed. [...] The remainder of the tournament games were played at Alexander Memorial Coliseum on the campus of Georgia Tech, with spectators restricted to team and conference personnel, media, team bands, and families of players only due to the much smaller size of the alternate venue. At the nearby Philips Arena, little disruption was noticed by the attendees during the game between the Hawks and the Los Angeles Clippers, even though damage occurred to the outside of the arena.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} how the ex ante real interest rates of Euro area {{countries have been}} modified {{by the introduction of}} the euro. We use cointegration analysis with endogenous breaks in a panel data context. Our results show that the "euro effect" is significant in our sample and that after the introduction of the euro, the real interest parity (RIP) holds. This last conclusion is due to a decrease in the nominal interest rate differentials rather than to a reduction in goods and services price differentials and in the exchange rate volatility. <b>RIP</b> European integration <b>Panel</b> data...|$|R
40|$|We exploit {{advances}} in panel data econometrics {{to test whether}} real interest parity holds in the Pacific Basin region. We test for a unit root in the difference between either the US, Japanese or Euro area real interest rate and the real interest rates from a panel of eleven Pacific Basin economies. Unlike extant studies that test for <b>RIP</b> using <b>panel</b> data, we use Bai and Ng's (2004) PANIC test which allows for a very general model of cross-section dependence, including the possibility of cross-unit cointegration. Ignoring the possibility of cross-unit cointegration can lead to severe size distortions and to an over-rejection of the null hypothesis of a unit root. We overturn earlier findings based on first-generation panel tests, and demonstrate that cross-unit cointegration leads to incorrect conclusions. We find that RIP holds in the Pacific region. Real interest rates converge to the US rate. We find no support for the hypothesis that Pacific Basin real interest rates converge to either the Japanese or Euro area rates.

50|$|Patrick's Speedweeks in 2014 greatly contrasted {{from the}} {{previous}} year. Although her pole {{from the previous}} year's Daytona 500 {{put her in the}} Sprint Unlimited, she was part of a crash on lap 35 which saw her spin out as she tried to avoid a wrecking group of cars in the tri-oval that included Patrick's teammates Tony Stewart, Kurt Busch, and Kevin Harvick, as well as others like Matt Kenseth and Jeff Gordon. Just as Patrick straightened out her car, Stenhouse, who had lost his brakes, t-boned her in the driver's side, <b>ripping</b> the door <b>panel</b> off her car and spraying the underlying safety foam blocks all across the track. In Daytona 500 practice, Patrick and Stewart both blew engines. This saw both drivers have to change engines and start {{from the rear of the}} field both for the Budweiser Duels and the Daytona 500.|$|R
2500|$|A severe {{winter storm}} arrived on December 10â€“11, 2010, with over [...] of snow accumulation, and strong winds; those winds made the roof unsafe for the snow removal crew. As {{the workers were}} pulled back, the roof was already sagging in the center. On December 12 at about 5:00a.m., the roof had a catastrophic {{collapse}} as three panels tore open. The night before, a Fox Sports crew setting up for an upcoming Vikings game noticed water leaking from the roof and kept their cameras on all night; those cameras captured the roof tearing and ice and snow falling into the stadium. No one was injured. Most of the roof sagged and {{came to rest on}} cable stays. The collapse caused no damage inside the stadium aside from a light fixture and some seats. The turf was not damaged; a drainage system designed for cleaning purposes allowed the field to dry out. On December 15, 2010, a fourth <b>panel</b> <b>ripped</b> open, sending more snow and ice into the dome.|$|R
500|$|Very {{high-end}} EF4 {{damage was}} again observed near {{the intersection of}} Illinois Route 64 and Illinois Route 251, where a row of five homes was completely leveled, two of which were swept away. One of the homes that was swept away was anchor-bolted, though the foundation was of cinder-block construction. Intense ground scouring was evident nearby, a car was thrown a full mile, and debris was wind-rowed long distances through fields in this area. Winds were again estimated at around 200mph (320km/h), with the damage at this location again being near-EF5 in intensity. Further to the northeast, the tornado inflicted high-end EF4 damage as a large farmstead was completely destroyed. A well-constructed barn was completely obliterated, and a [...] reinforced concrete silo {{was reduced to a}} pile of rubble. A large farmhouse on the property was completely swept away, and nearby trees were severely stripped and debarked. The tornado weakened as it crossed North Moore Road, where a warehouse building had a collapse of its non-bearing exterior walls. One small barn or outbuilding had a collapse of exterior walls while another had a few metal roof <b>panels</b> <b>ripped</b> off. After crossing Interstate 39, it caused moderate roof damage to a large residence and tossed and rolled a heavy barn. The tornado continued to produce generally EF1 damage to trees and outbuildings before exiting Ogle County, and it was briefly accompanied by an EF0 satellite tornado that damaged crops to its southeast.|$|R
60|$|It was {{necessarily}} {{a difficult and}} violent affair, for the Vaterland had not been planned for the necessities of a balloon. The captain got one <b>panel</b> <b>ripped</b> too soon and the others not soon enough. She dropped heavily, bounced clumsily, and smashed the hanging gallery into the fore-part, mortally injuring Von Winterfeld, and then came down in a collapsing heap after dragging for some moments. The forward shield and its machine gun tumbled in upon the things below. Two men were hurt badly--one got a broken leg and one was internally injured--by flying rods and wires, and Bert was pinned for a time under the side. When at last he got clear and could take {{a view of the}} situation, the great black eagle that had started so splendidly from Franconia six evenings ago, sprawled deflated over the cabins of the airship and the frost-bitten rocks of this desolate place and looked a most unfortunate bird--as though some one had caught it and wrung its neck and cast it aside. Several of the crew of the airship were standing about in silence, contemplating the wreckage and the empty wilderness into which they had fallen. Others were busy under the imromptu tent made by the empty gas-chambers. The Prince had gone a little way off and was scrutinising the distant heights through his field-glass. They had the appearance of old sea cliffs; here and there were small clumps of conifers, and in two places tall cascades. The nearer ground was strewn with glaciated boulders and supported nothing but a stunted Alpine vegetation of compact clustering stems and stalkless flowers. No river was visible, but the air was full of the rush and babble of a torrent close at hand. A bleak and biting wind was blowing. Ever and again a snowflake drifted past. The springless frozen earth under Bert's feet felt strangely dead and heavy after the buoyant airship.|$|R
50|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled {{a few inches from}} its original location, and some scouring of grass was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200 mph (320 km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.Very high-end EF4 damage was again observed near the intersection of Illinois Route 64 and Illinois Route 251, where a row of five homes was completely leveled, two of which were swept away.

Further to the northeast, the tornado inflicted high-end EF4 damage as a large farmstead was completely destroyed. A well-constructed barn was completely obliterated, and a 40 ft reinforced concrete silo was reduced to a pile of rubble. A large farmhouse on the property was completely swept away, and nearby trees were severely stripped and debarked.
