While name changes and other International Olympic Committee suggestions were agreed upon as necessary to go forward, the integration of these changes into the Federation's constitution and governance strategy took over four years and the application languished as a result until 1979, when the IOC responded with a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> on IFNA's finances and governance. [...] The decision to provide additional information was deferred until 1979's Conference. [...] The Jamaican representatives were frustrated with the slow process inside the organisation and tried {{to take steps to}} speed the process up inside IFNA. This included submitting proposals for organisational changes to address the most recent IOC feedback, addressing issues such as player drug testing, the selling of television and radio rights, and how to establish an Olympic draw among other points. [...] Because of Jamaican influence, IFNA created a specific committee to work on the issue of addressing Olympic requirements, which was composed of New Zealanders Rena Straford, Lorna McOnchie and Anne Taylor.

5000|$|On February 18, 2016, The Minister of Environment and Climate Change, the Honourable Catherine McKenna, {{requested}} {{additional information}} and further studies from OPG {{on the environmental}} assessment for the proposed DGR project. This came after the submission of the Joint Review Panel Environmental Assessment Report approving the project. The Panel requested that OPG provide additional information on three aspects of the project: (1) alternate locations for the project, (2) cumulative environmental effects of the project, and (3) an updated list of mitigation commitments for each identified  adverse effect under the CEAA 2012. In requesting additional information from OPG concerning alternate locations, Minister Catherine McKenna requested “a study that details the environmental effects of technically and economically feasible alternate locations for the project, with specific reference to actual locations that would meet Ontario Power Generation’s criteria for technically and economically feasible” In a response letter from OPG dated April 15, 2016, OPG outlined their interpretation of Minister McKenna’s <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information.</b> OPG  stated that they intended to provide {{an assessment of the}} environmental effects of two technically and economically feasible geologic regions in Ontario for a new L&ILW disposal facility. This included one assessment to consider a DGR located in a sedimentary rock formation located in Southern Ontario, and one assessment to consider a DGR located in a granite rock formation in central to northern Ontario.On December 28, 2016, OPG submitted their response to the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> issued by Minister McKenna. In the submission, OPG applied the criteria of technical and economic feasibility to the entire province of Ontario, and provided the Panel with two geographic regions that met the criteria - Crystalline Rock, a massive region extending throughout central and northern Ontario, and Sedimentary Rock, encompassing nearly all of southwestern Ontario. Included in this response were a series of GPS coordinates mapping the perimeter of the Crystalline and Sedimentary alternate locations, which encompass more than 70% of the province of Ontario ...|$|E
50|$|The {{project to}} develop a {{regulated}} product submission standard was initiated on June 22, 2005. Release 1 was spearheaded by Jason Rock of GlobalSubmit, {{with the aim of}} creating one standardized submission format to support all of the FDA's electronic product submissions. The Health Level 7 message was created by leveraging existing human pharmaceutical experience, such as The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). RPS Release 1 provides the capability to cross-reference previously submitted material owned by the sponsor as well as append, replace and delete parts of the document lifecycle. Release 2, led by Peggy Leizear of the Office of Planning at the FDA, grants the ability to exchange contact information, classify submission content and handle multi-region submissions. The second release of RPS also handles two-way communication—The regulatory authority (e.g. FDA) will use RPS to send correspondence (e.g. <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information,</b> meeting minutes, application approval) to the submitter.|$|E
