40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} factors – specifically stakeholder pressures – that may affect the likelihood that firms will respond to violent conflict. Survey and archival data on respondents from 471 multinational and local firms operating in 80 countries were used to explore these issues. Key findings include: (1) local stakeholder pressure is associated with the likelihood that firms will respond directly to violent conflict, collaborating with other organizations or <b>working</b> <b>alone</b> when doing so; and (2) international stakeholder pressure is associated with the likelihood that firms will respond indirectly to violent conflict, collaborating with other organizations or <b>working</b> <b>alone.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{side-by-side}} programming, two programmers (typically {{working on}} related {{aspects of a}} project) move their computers so close to one another that they can effortlessly change between <b>working</b> <b>alone</b> and <b>working</b> together, where <b>working</b> <b>alone</b> is the primary mode. The technique was proposed {{in order to obtain}} some of the advantages of pair programming at lower total effort. As a first step towards understanding how and when to use side-by-side programming, the present study aims at describing when and for what purpose side-by-side programmers get together to cooperate. The main result is a classification of the cooperation episodes by purpose and content int...|$|R

40|$|Participants {{completed}} {{blocks of}} trials under simple (i. e., work-alone), competi-tive, and self-competitive fixed-interval 20 -s schedules of reinforcement. In gen-eral, response rates were highest during competition and lowest while <b>working</b> <b>alone.</b> In addition, whereas participants emitted responses {{at a constant}} rate while <b>working</b> <b>alone,</b> competitive responses often followed a break-and-run pat-tern; self-competitive responses, in contrast, were highly variable in both rate and pattern, often changing within a single session. Finally, no systematic rela-tion was found between rates of responding and probability of reinforcement under competitive and self-competitive conditions. These observations suggest that self-competitive behavior may contain many {{of the characteristics of}} com-petitive behavior. Behavior analysts have defined competition as a situation in which two or more individuals respond but not all receive reinforcers (e. g., Buskist...|$|R
40|$|Entrepreneurs are {{surprisingly}} {{unlikely to have}} partners. One possible explanation {{for this is that}} entrepreneurs have distinctive preferences for <b>working</b> <b>alone</b> rather than in teams. However, a number of alternative explanations exist, such as an inability to locate suitable partners or low profitability from having a partner. Utilizing a diverse subject population with a high proportion of active entrepreneurs, we use a team production experiment to directly examine whether entrepreneurs prefer to work alone or in a team. The experiment also measures an important determinant of entrepreneurs' performances within teams, and their relative tendency to free-ride. The data indicate that entrepreneurs, while no more likely to free-ride on their teammates, are substantially more interested in <b>working</b> <b>alone</b> than similar non-entrepreneurs. © 2013 Elsevier B.
