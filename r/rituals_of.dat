5|$|Occasionally, {{individual}} murderers {{were perceived}} to have been so heinous that standard punishments like beheading or to be broken on the wheel were not regarded as sufficiently commensurate with their crimes, and extended <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> execution that might include impalement were devised. The case of Pavel Vašanský (Paul Wasansky in German transcript) may serve as an example here.|$|E
5|$|Although {{certain forms}} of dance were disapproved of at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was {{embedded}} in religious <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> archaic Rome, {{such as those of}} the dancing armed Salian priests and of the Arval Brothers, priesthoods which underwent a revival during the Principate. Ecstatic dancing was a feature of the international mystery religions, particularly the cult of Cybele as practised by her eunuch priests the Galli and of Isis. In the secular realm, dancing girls from Syria and Cadiz were extremely popular.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an ethnographic {{report on the}} {{childbirth}} and child-rearing rituals in Uygur Xinjiang China and also includes an analysis of that transformation from a view point of the sociology of knowlege. The childbirth and child-rearing rituals in Uygur culture usually consist of four rituals: the <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> birth, the <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> naming, the <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> cradle, and the <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> circumcision for boys. The <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> birth has its origin in traditional folk belief and is disappearing in cities. The <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> giving children a name has its origin in Islamic doctrine and is held on 7 th day after birth. The <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> the cradle is held on 40 th day after birth. People put the baby into a new cradle and pray his healthy developing. The <b>ritual</b> <b>of</b> circumcision for boys is very important Islamic ritual in which 6 or 7 years old boys have a small operation in their genital as Muslim symbol. The findings of this field-research is that {{the system of the}} recipe knowledge, i. e. what peple must know to act competently (in accord with expected standards) in routine situations of everyday life, in terms of the holding and performing <b>of</b> these <b>rituals</b> is appears to be changing under the process of modernization and developing of a market economy in China. Those observations bring us to the second point which is that those rituals are changing in its recipe knowledge but are maintained in paractice, especially in Islamic-rooted rituals...|$|R

5|$|Although {{they were}} {{excluded}} from the formal <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> the temple, laymen still sought to interact with the gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods. The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues to interact with the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.|$|E
5|$|Amrish Puri as Mola Ram: A Thuggee {{priest who}} {{performs}} <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> human sacrifices. The character {{is named after}} a 17th-century Indian painter. Lucas wanted Mola Ram to be terrifying, so the screenwriters added elements of Aztec and Hawaiian human sacrificers, and European devil worship to the character. To create his headdress, make-up artist Tom Smith based the skull on a cow (as this would be sacrilegious), and used a latex shrunken head.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E

5|$|Ramalala Nahachhu (रामलला नहछू), {{literally}} The Nahachhu {{ceremony of}} the child Rama, is an Awadhi work of 20 verses composed in the Sohar metre. The Nahachhu ceremony involves cutting the nails of the feet before the Hindu Samskaras (<b>rituals)</b> <b>of</b> Chudakarana, Upanayana, Vedarambha, Samavartana or Vivaha. In the work, events {{take place in the}} city of Ayodhya, so it is considered to describe the Nahachhu before Upanayana, Vedarambha and Samavartana.|$|E
5|$|Revanta was worshipped as {{guardian}} deity {{of warriors}} and horses, protector from {{the dangers of}} forests and the patron god of hunting. The worship of Revanta is closely associated with Saura, cult of Surya. Often, scriptures like Vishnudharmottara Purana and Kalika Purana recommend worship of Revanta alongside Surya or according to the <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> Sun worship. Shabha-kalpa-druma records Revanta's worship after Surya's, in the Hindu month of Ashvin by warriors. Nakula, the fourth Pandava, {{is believed to have}} written Ashavashastram on horses. He suggests worship of Raivata to protect horses from ghosts.|$|E

His cause of death is unknown, but smallpox and natural causes are both cited. The Mohave grieved deeply; Irataba's cremation and the <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> mourning were reported in newspapers {{as far away as}} Omaha, Nebraska. Irataba was succeeded as leader on the Colorado Reservation by his nephew, Qolho qorau of the Vemacka clan, who upheld his uncle's policies.|$|E
5|$|The Lingbao School (Simplified Chinese: 灵宝派; Traditional Chinese: 靈寶派; pinyin: Líng Bǎo Pài), {{also known}} as the School of the Sacred Jewel or the School of Numinous Treasure, was an {{important}} Daoist school that emerged in China in between the Jin Dynasty and the Liu Song Dynasty in the early fifth century CE. It lasted for about two hundred years until it was absorbed into the Shangqing and Zhengyi currents during the Tang Dynasty. The Lingbao School is a synthesis of religious ideas based on Shangqing texts, the <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> the Celestial Masters, and Buddhist practices.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtship}} <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> the American goldfinch include aerial maneuvers {{and singing}} by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male {{is able to}} signal his quality and fitness, both {{in the short term}} (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage). If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Grant began {{describing}} {{himself as}} the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order) of the O.T.O., claiming that he deserved this title not by direct succession from Crowley but because he displayed the inspiration and innovation that Germer lacked. A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member. In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973. Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed the <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in ancient}} times these {{similarities}} were controversial. Non-Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE thought Christianity and the mystery cults resembled each other. Reacting to these claims by outsiders, early Christian apologists denied that these cults had influenced their religion. The 17th-century Protestant scholar Isaac Casaubon brought up the question again by accusing the Catholic Church of deriving its sacraments from the <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> the mystery cults. Charles-François Dupuis, in the late 18th century, went further by claiming that all Christianity originated in the mystery cults. Intensified by religious disputes between Protestants, Catholics, and non-Christians, the controversy has continued to the present day.|$|E

5|$|Fearing the {{approaching}} Jin army, Song emperor Huizong planned to retreat south. The emperor deserting the capital {{would have been}} viewed {{as an act of}} capitulation, so court officials convinced him to abdicate. There were few objections. Rescuing an empire in crisis from destruction was more important than preserving the <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> imperial inheritance. In January 1126, {{a few days before the}} New Year, Huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role of Retired Emperor. The Jurchen forces reached the Yellow River on January 27, 1126, two days after the New Year. Huizong fled Kaifeng the next day, escaping south and leaving the newly enthroned emperor Qinzong (r. 1126–1127) in charge of the capital.|$|E
5|$|The Kwan Um School of Zen {{was founded}} in 1983 and, unlike more {{traditional}} practice in Korea, Seungsahn allowed laypersons in the lineage to wear the robes of full monastics. Celibacy was not required and the <b>rituals</b> <b>of</b> the school are unique. Although the Kwan Um School does utilize traditional Seon and Zen rituals, elements of their practice also closely resemble rituals found often in Pure Land Buddhism, Chan Buddhism, and the Huayan school. In 1986, along with a former student and Dharma heir Dae Gak, Seungsahn founded a retreat center and temple in Clay City, Kentucky called Furnace Mountain—the temple name being Kwan Se Um San Ji Sah (or, Perceive World Sound High Ground Temple). The center functions independently of the Kwan Um organization today.|$|E

Iftah Ya Simsim premiered in Kuwait in September 1979, and was broadcast in all Arabic-speaking countries excluding Egypt. The show's opening consisted of a catchy tune that became beloved of its young viewers. As the song played, the opening footage showed children across the Arab world running past familiar landmarks like the Pyramids and playing in playgrounds and ancient alleyways before running into a white fort that had its gates open wide. The show's set consisted of an intricately traditional Arabian neighborhood called Sharee Eshreen (20th Street).|$|E
