40|$|The use of {{riveting}} hammers can expose {{workers to}} harmful levels of hand-transmitted vibration (HTV). As {{a part of}} efforts to reduce HTV exposures through tool selection, the primary objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the applicability of a standardized laboratory-based <b>riveting</b> <b>hammer</b> assessment protocol for screening riveting hammers. The second objective was to characterize the vibration emissions of reduced vibration riveting hammers and to make approximations of the HTV exposures of workers operating these tools in actual work tasks. Eight pneumatic riveting hammers were selected for the study. They were first assessed in a laboratory using the standardized method for measuring vibration emissions at the tool handle. The tools were then further assessed under actual working conditions during three aircraft sheet metal riveting tasks. Although the average vibration magnitudes of the riveting hammers measured in the laboratory test were considerably different from those measured in the field study, the rank orders of the tools determined via these tests were fairly consistent, especially for the lower vibration tools. This study identified four tools that consistently exhibited lower frequency-weighted and unweighted accelerations in both the laboratory and workplace evaluations. These observations suggest that the standardized <b>riveting</b> <b>hammer</b> test is acceptable for identifying tools that could be expected to exhibit lower vibrations in workplace environments. However, the large differences between the accelerations measured in the laboratory and field suggest that the standardized laboratory-based tool assessment is not suitable for estimating workplace <b>riveting</b> <b>hammer</b> HTV exposures. Based on the frequency-weighted accelerations measured at the tool handles during the three work tasks, the sheet metal mechanics assigned to these tasks at the studied workplace are unlikely to exceed the daily vibration exposure action value (2. 5 m s(- 2)) using any of the evaluated riveting hammers.

40|$|Abstract: Research {{regarding}} {{the risk of}} developing hand-arm vibration syndrome after exposure to impact vibration has produced conflicting results. This study used an established animal model of vibration-induced dysfunction to determine how exposure to impact vibration affects peripheral blood vessels and nerves. The tails of male rats were exposed to a single bout of impact vibration (15 min exposure, at a dominant frequency of 30 Hz and an unweighted acceleration of approxi-mately 345 m/s 2) generated by a <b>riveting</b> <b>hammer.</b> Responsiveness of the ventral tail artery to adrenoreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction and acetylcholine-mediated re-dilation was measured ex vivo. Ventral tail nerves and nerve endings in the skin were assessed using morphological and immunohistochemical techniques. Impact vibration did not alter vascular responsiveness to any factors or affect trunk nerves. However, 4 days following exposure there was an increase in protein-gene product (PGP) 9. 5 staining around hair follicles. A single exposure to impact vibration, with the exposure characteristics described above, affects peripheral nerves but not blood vessels...|$|E

40|$|Prolonged, {{extensive}} {{exposure to}} hand-transmitted vibration {{could cause a}} series of vibration-induced disorders in the vascular, sensorineural, and musculoskeletal structures of the human hand-arm system, which have been collectively called hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). 1 To assess the risk of HAVS the international standard ISO 5349 - 1 (2001) 1 recommends using the root-mean-square (rms) acceleration of the measured vibration with a frequency weighting. While a few epidemiological studies have reported results consistent with the predictions made according to the recommendation, many other studies have reported results with large discrepancies. 2 This may be partially attributed to the time-averaging effect involved in calculation of the frequency components, especially for impact type tools. Because the spectral characteristics of impact tools change dramatically with time, a time-frequency (T-F) analysis can provide better characterizations of such highly transient vibrations. The analytic wavelet transform (AWT) is an ideal T-F analysis tool because it possesses the advantages of both the Fourier transform and the wavelet transform. 3 The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the application of the AWT method for characterizing the impact tool vibrations and assessing their exposure risk. Methods Five tools (two chipping hammers, two riveting hammers, and one concrete cutting saw) were used in this study. The saw vibration was measured when it was used to cut a section of road pavement during a repair. The vibrations on the other tools were measured by the procedure specified in ISO 8662 - 2 (1992). 4 A sampling rate of 16, 386 Hz was used in the measurement. The AWT and Fourier analysis were applied to these signals and to identify their characteristics. Results Figure 1 compares the T-F characteristics of the accelerations measured from the relatively steady concrete saw and a <b>riveting</b> <b>hammer.</b> The frequency weighting specified in ISO 5349 - 11 was applied in the calculations.

40|$|Work with {{hand-held}} {{power tools}} {{can be found}} in most industries all over the world. This type of work exposes the operators to different kind of loads like gripping-forces, feed-forces, exposure to vibration and noise, holding hot or cold surfaces and the exposure to dust. Designing a power tool with good ergonomics is a matter of finding the best compromise. As a simple example, increasing the mass is not acceptable because it will increase the forces needed to handle the tool. At the same time increased mass will in most cases reduce the vibrations. Vibration disorders related to the use of hand-held power tools has been known and reported since long. It is therefore essential that low vibrating tools are developed and used. The new vibration regulations in Europe, based on the Physical Agents (Vibration) Directive, have put increased focus on the vibration control in industry. Forces acting on the tool cause vibration Tools for industrial use must be of very robust design to withstand the very hard use they are exposed to. Industrial tools are therefore normally designed with the main parts made of metal. From a vibration point of view this means that most tools can be regarded as rigid bodies, especially because the dominating frequency normally is equal to the rotational frequency of the tool spindle or the blow frequency for a percussive tool. These frequencies are with few exceptions below 200 Hz. Handles however can not always be regarded as rigidly connected to the tool. There are several examples of weak suspensions designed to reduce vibration transmitted to the hands of the operator. There are also examples of designs where the handles just happened to be non-rigidly connected and in some cases even in resonance within the frequency region of interest. Oscillating forces act on the tool and the result is vibration. Design principals In all cases forces are the source of vibration. This leads to the three basic principles to control vibration: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Control the magnitude of the vibrating forces. Examples are the balancing unit on a grinder or the differential piston in a chipping hammer. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Make the tool less sensitive to the vibrating forces. Examples can be when the mass of the guard on a grinder is rigidly connected to the tool to increase the inertia of the tool. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Isolate the vibrations in the tool from the grip surfaces. Examples are vibration-dampening handles on grinders or pavement breakers, the air-spring behind the blow-mechanism in a <b>riveting</b> <b>hammer</b> or the mass spring system in a chipping hammer...|$|E

5000|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of blind rivets, installation of a solid rivet typically required access to both sides of the assembly: a <b>rivet</b> <b>hammer</b> {{on one side and a}} bucking bar on the other side.

40|$|Percussive {{tools such}} as {{chipping}} <b>hammers,</b> <b>riveting</b> <b>hammers</b> and concrete breakers produce shock-type (impact) vibrations with large amount of vibration energy in the high frequency region (kHz). Reported injuries from shock-type and high frequency vibrations are higher  occurrence of vascular disorders, myelin disruption, edema and reduced motor performance.

A mean of 1. 8 workers/year has been injured with VWF and the cost of one injured worker has been estimate to 0. 5 million SEK. One way to eliminate the injuries could be to replace the tools from Atlas Copco with better tools from another manufacturer. A protective handle was designed for the chipping hammers by Atlas Copco, to prevent operators from holding directly on the vibrating parts. However, the protective handle was not vibration isolated and a follow up project, this thesis, was started to redesign and vibration isolate the handle. An isolated protective handle with two rubber bushings was finally developed from theory of vibration isolation together with a subjective evaluation by experienced personnel and with low and high frequency vibration measurements. The final protective handle significantly reduced both the harmful low frequency vibrations (measured according to ISO 5349) and the potentially harmful high frequency vibrations (not measured according to any ISO standard), compared to the non-isolated original handle  developed by Atlas Copco...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} club crest was a crossed pair of <b>riveting</b> <b>hammers,</b> {{as used in}} the shipbuilding process, and the 'hammers' {{would continue}} to feature in West Ham United's badge to the present day. The original colours of the team were dark blue due to Arnold Hills being a former student and football Blue of Oxford University, although the team {{used a variety of}} kits. They often used the claret and sky blue house colours of the actual Iron Works and would also wear all sky blue or white uniforms. They permanently adopted claret and blue for home games in the summer of 1899. Irons right-half Charlie Dove had got the kits for the club from his father William Dove, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames Ironworks. Bill Dove had been at a fair in Birmingham, close to Villa Park, the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered money that one of them would win. Bill Dove defeated them, and when they were unable to pay the bet, one of the Villa players who was responsible for washing the team's kit offered a complete side's 'uniforms' to Dove in payment of the bet. The Aston Villa player subsequently reported to his club that the kit was 'missing'. Thames Ironworks, and later West Ham United, would continue to use their previously favoured colours for their away kits. In recent years the club have committed to a sky blue-white-dark blue rotation, each kit having a one-season shelf life.|$|R
50|$|As {{the planks}} reached the desired height, the {{interior}} frame (futtocks) and cross beams were added. Frames were placed close together, {{which is an}} enduring feature of thin planked ships, still used today on some lightweight wooden racing craft such as those designed by Bruce Farr. Viking boat builders used a spacing of about 850 mm. Part {{of the reason for}} this spacing was to achieve the correct distance between rowing stations and to create space for the chests used by Norse sailors as thwarts (seats). The bottom futtocks next to the keel were made from natural L-shaped crooks. The upper futtocks were usually not attached to the lower futtocks to allow some hull twist. The parts were held together with iron <b>rivets,</b> <b>hammered</b> in from the outside of the hull and fastened from the inside with a rove (washers). The surplus rivet was then cut off. A ship normally used about 700 kg of iron nails in a 18 m long ship. In some ships the gap between the lower uneven futtock and the lapstrake planks was filled with a spacer block about 200 mm long. In later ships spruce stringers were fastened lengthwise to the futtocks roughly parallel to the keel. Longships had about five rivets for each yard (90 cm) of plank. In many early ships treenails (trenails, trunnels) were used to fasten large timbers. First, a hole about 20 mm wide hole was drilled through two adjoining timbers, a wooden pegs inserted which was split and a thin wedge inserted to expand the peg. Some treenails have been found with traces of linseed oil suggesting that treenails were soaked before the pegs were inserted. When dried the oil would act as a semi-waterproof weak filler/glue.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES - To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} with which workers report {{their exposure to}} occupational sources of hand transmitted (HTV) and whole body vibration (WBV). METHODS - 179 Workers from various jobs involving exposure to HTV or WBV completed a self administered questionnaire about sources of occupational exposure to vibration in the past week. They were then observed at work over 1 hour, after which they completed a second questionnaire concerning their exposures during this observation period. The feasibility of reported sources of exposure during the past week was examined by questioning managers and by inspection of tools and machines in the workplace. The accuracy of reported sources and durations of exposure in the 1 hour period were assessed relative to what had been observed. RESULTS - The feasibility of exposure in the previous week was confirmed for 97 % of subjects who reported exposure to HTV, and for 93 % of subjects who reported exposure to WBV. The individual sources of exposure reported were generally plausible, but occupational use of cars was substantially overreported, possibly because of confusion with their use in travel to and from work. The accuracy of exposures reported during the observation period was generally high, but some sources of HTV were confusedfor example, nailing and stapling guns reported as <b>riveting</b> <b>hammers,</b> and hammer drills not distinguished from other sorts of drill. Workers overestimated their duration of exposure to HTV by a median factor of 2. 5 (interquartile range (IQR) 1. 6 - 5. 9), but estimated durations of exposure were more accurate when the exposure was relatively continuous rather than for intermittent short periods. Reported durations of exposure to WBV were generally accurate (median ratio of reported to observed time 1. 1, IQR 1. 0 - 1. 2). CONCLUSIONS - Sources of recent occupational exposure to vibration seem to be reported with reasonable accuracy, but durations of exposure to HTV are systematically overestimated, particularly when the exposure is intermittent and for short periods. This {{raises the possibility that}} dose-response relations may have been biased in some of the studies on which exposure standards might be based, and that the levels in currently proposed standards may be too high.
