40|$|Abstract: This {{document}} outlines a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> {{proposals for}} a negotiated bus procurement contract. A <b>request</b> <b>for</b> proposals is generally used when {{the scope of}} work or specification is less well-defined. In addition, this type of procurement may be used in cases where the vehicle involves “emerging” technology or there is a requirement to discuss warranty provisions or design considerations. This document was developed using a crosssection of representatives from {{the public and private sectors}} of the public <b>transit</b> industry <b>for</b> use by <b>transit</b> agencies...|$|R
40|$|Congestion pricing {{provides}} opportunities <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> {{to become}} more self-reliant. Both the theory of congestion pricing and its use in congested US corridors are examined. A 5 % increase in commuter demand <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> is estimated in suburban corridors. New opportunities <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> are required if transit is to remain competitive in the USA. Automobile commuting is faster and more convenient as well as generously cross-subsidized for most US urban commuters...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] A {{regional}} {{light rail}} authority (“Authority”) {{in a large}} metropolitan area is involved in major extension of its services and is facing a funding shortage. The Authority has elected to raise additional funds from the sale or joint development of properties immediately adjacent to proposed light rail stations. One site under consideration is a 9. 2 -acre site adjacent to the Blue Heaven Station on its B-Line. The Authority issued a <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> Proposals (RFP) for development of the site by private developers, to include multi-modal transit facilities, 1, 000 parking spaces <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> riders and appropriate related uses. In the RFP, the Authority suggested a price for the site of $ 8 million and indicated a willingness to consider other proposals such as joint development...|$|R
