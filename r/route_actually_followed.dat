40|$|The paper reports an {{exploratory}} study, using an unusual technique to investigate drivers' response to in-vehicle route guidance information systems. Eighteen drivers were recruited, {{and asked to}} make {{a series of three}} trips in an unfamiliar area. Each driver was given turning advice, via a speech synthesiser, on one of these trips. This advice was based on average traffic conditions for the time of day. Unbeknown to the drivers, the advice was in fact triggered by the experimenter, who was riding as a back-seat passenger. Details were kept of times and routes taken with and without guidance, and with different levels of network familiarity. Records were also kept (using questionnaires and video and audio recording) of planning and route-following strategies. As expected, both receipt of guidance and even very rudimentary network familiarity resulted in reduced journey times, and routes closer to the guidance recommendations. The study indicated that factors including the directness of possible routes, their perceived complexity, and familiarity all affect route choice, but to different extents for different individuals and under different circumstances. Error was shown to be important in determining the <b>route</b> <b>actually</b> <b>followed</b> when guidance was withheld. The study showed that giving in-vehicle guidance using the mock-up technique described is practicable, and does influence drivers' route-choice and route-following behaviour. A possible future study is outlined, aimed at identifying the determinants of the drivers' level of compliance with advice when they believe that advice is based on real-time traffic information...|$|E

5000|$|Route 1A follows U.S. Route 1 (US 1) closely through Washington County, locally {{known as}} [...] "South County." [...] US 1 is a divided highway {{for most of}} its length in this region; there is also a short freeway section in South Kingstown and Narragansett. Because Interstate 95 largely {{bypasses}} the main population centers in the southern portion of the state, instead following a more inland routing, US 1 serves as the main thoroughfare. Route 1A, in comparison, runs on surface streets, acting as an alternate route for US 1 that provides access to more local roads and business districts. There are five distinct sections, each separated by short concurrencies with US 1; as an alternate route, Route 1A is unsigned on each concurrency.The first section of Route 1A is 8.8 mi in length and runs entirely in Westerly. Beginning in downtown Westerly, the roadway takes a more southerly routing in the town than its parent route and serves the affluent coastal community of Watch Hill and Misquamicut State Beach. In Westerly, <b>Route</b> 1A north <b>actually</b> <b>follows</b> a due south route for its first 3.7 mi. The roadway begins as Main Street, which merges with US 1 (Broad Street) just after the latter route crosses the Pawcatuck River from Stonington, Connecticut into downtown Westerly. Route 1A north continues southward on Beach Street before turning south onto Watch Hill Road. The roadway then turns to the southeast along Shore Road, which runs parallel to Misquamicut Beach, Atlantic Beach and Winnapaug Pond, until Shore Road meets Post Road not far from the Charlestown town line. Many maps incorrectly post the entire length of Watch Hill Road west of Shore Road as Route 1A.|$|R
