50|$|While he was <b>recording</b> <b>Stop</b> and Smell the Roses at Cherokee Studios in 1980, Ringo Starr invited George Harrison, Paul McCartney and Linda McCartney to {{guest on}} the album; Paul McCartney and Harrison also {{produced}} {{some of the}} tracks. Starr had approached John Lennon to help out as well, had received two demos of songs which eventually wound up on the posthumous Lennon album Milk and Honey, and reportedly, Lennon had agreed to come to Los Angeles in January 1981 and {{take part in the}} recording; the album then would have been a modest Beatles reunion. The assassination of Lennon prevented those plans from coming to fruition. Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones also collaborated with Starr on the album at Cherokee, adding guitar, bass, saxophone, keyboards, and back-up vocals.|$|E

[...] (see Franklin Dam controversy#Blockade). At a live performance, Stop the Drop (for nuclear disarmament), at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl on 13 February that year, an ad hoc ensemble had Goanna joined by members of fellow Australian groups, Redgum and Midnight Oil, which recorded a live version of the track. Howard, the song's writer, was credited as F. River. The single reached No. 12 nationally.

The most widely renowned musician from 20th century D.C. is undoubtedly Duke Ellington, a jazz pioneer. Later D.C. jazz musicians included Charlie Rouse (saxophonist, with Thelonious Monk), Billy Hart (drummer), Ira Sullivan (tenor saxophonist) and Leo Parker (bop baritone saxophonist). Ahmet Ertegün, a Turkish-born jazz fan, came to D.C. at age twelve and later went on to found Atlantic Records. Todd Duncan was a D.C.-born singer who made history by being the first to play {{the lead of the}} opera Porgy and Bess; he later became the first black man to play Tonio in I Pagliacci.

5000|$|Now Hear This! Garage & Beat {{from the}} Norman Petty Vaults is a {{compilation}} that highlights recordings by garage rock acts made at Norman Petty's recording studio in Clovis, New Mexico during the 1960s. [...] Petty {{is best known}} for his work as the producer on Buddy Holly's records in the 1950s, many of which were recorded at the Clovis facility. [...] He continued to produce records in the 1960s, providing a regular <b>recording</b> <b>stop</b> for a handful of the plentiful bands working at the time, particularly in the wake of the British Invasion. [...] The set, put out in 2007 by Big Beat Records, features twenty five tracks that encompass the broad stylistic range of the garage genre, many displaying clear British Invasion influence, and Petty's production lends most of the tracks with a certain level of polish and professionalism not always associated with the genre. [...] The collection is well-mastered, displaying generally high sound quality throughout and the packaging includes well-researched liner notes highlighting the artists and their songs. [...] Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, in a piece he wrote in the December 25, 2008 issue of Rolling Stone, mentioned this album as one of his favorite compilations. [...] The set begins with the Crickets, Buddy Holly's former group, doing the title track [...] "Now Hear This", which displays a clear British Invasion-influenced sound that departs from their earlier, more familiar style. [...] The Cinders are featured on several tracks, beginning with the second cut [...] "Three Minutes Time". [...] They do a version of Van Morrison's near-obligatory garage band standard, [...] "Gloria". [...] The Perils' [...] "Hate" [...] provides the compilation's darkest moment, an eerie and brooding invective with lyrics that deliver a seething rebuke to a former lover, set to the slow drumbeat of a funeral dirge. [...] The Cords appear on two cuts, beginning with the moody [...] "Too Late to Kiss You" [...] and then later [...] "Sin Crazed Woman". [...] The Teardrops do the Farfisa organ-drenched [...] "Sweet Sweet Sadie", and the Monacles appear with [...] "Let Your Lovin' Grow". [...] Barry Allen with Wes Dakus' Rebels do four cuts including the oft-recorded [...] "And My Baby's Gone", [...] "Danger Zone", and the set's closer, [...] "Love Me Again".|$|E
40|$|As {{most of you}} {{probably}} already know from previous articles in our quarterly Press Release, the standard configuration of the actiCHamp system (our most recent amplifier for neurophysiological research applications) includes the PyCorder program, a genuine and customizable open-source acquisition software based on the Python programming language. Notwithstanding the enthusiasm our users have shown for the PyCorder software, some months ago we decided also to make the BrainVision Recorder acquisition software compatible with the actiCHamp amplifiers. This decision arose from our wish to provide our customers with {{a wider range of}} options. In fact, after the latest update for BrainVision Recorder 1. 20 is released, actiCHamp users will be able to choose between the flexible structure of the PyCorder and the user-friendly BrainVision Recorder (*) with its many ready-to-use functions. Here some of the functions that will be available with the actiCHamp amplifiers using the updated BrainVision Recorder 1. 20 : 1. Digital port settings that allow both the trigger-in and the trigger-out ports to be set. 2. My-Button configuration. For anyone not familiar with actiCHamp-related terminology, the My-Button is a control button on the front panel of the actiCHamp amplifier that enables the amplifier and the recording software to be controlled without having to manually call up the corresponding functions in the acquisition software. The BrainVision Recorder program will provide a ready-to-use interface for defining a sequence of functional steps that will be initiated by clicking on the button. For instance, a typical predefined sequence might be: start impedance check, stop impedance check, start <b>recording,</b> <b>stop</b> recording. 3. A higher sampling rate than the PyCorder software: Number of channels PyCorder Recorder 1. 20 160 EEG channels + 8 AUX channels 10 KHz 25 KH...|$|E
