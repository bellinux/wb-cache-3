5|$|The Liberty Head nickel was {{replaced}} after 1912, and initially {{there was no}} indication that 1913-dated pieces with that design existed. In December 1919, a coin dealer, Samuel W. Brown, placed advertisements in coin publications, offering to buy 1913 Liberty Head nickels. The following August, Brown appeared at the annual American Numismatic Association (ANA) convention bearing such a piece. Brown claimed that a master die had been prepared for 1913 and that these pieces had been <b>run</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> test it. As it turned out, Brown possessed five coins, which he eventually sold. After spending fifteen years {{in the hands of the}} eccentric Col. E.H.R. Green, the famous Fort Worth, Texas, area collector, the coins were finally dispersed in 1943. Since then, they have had several owners each. Today, two are on public display—at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the ANA's Money Museum in Colorado Springs, while three are owned privately. The most recent sale of a 1913 Liberty Head nickel was in January 2010, when one sold for $3,737,500 in an auction.|$|E
5|$|Fran {{once lived}} with her sisters Jote and Mjrn in Eruyt Village, the secluded Viera {{settlement}} in Golmore Jungle, but became restless and desired to see the outside world. This was {{a major source of}} conflict between her and the other viera, especially her elder sister Jote, who served as the village matriarch. Fran argued that although all Viera begin their lives in the forest, they are not necessarily bound to remain there to the end. When the party encounters an impassable Viera barrier on the path through Golmore, Fran is forced to return to the village and ask for help. She learns from Jote that their youngest sister Mjrn has <b>run</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the nearby magicite mines. When Fran finds her and brings her back, Mjrn reveals she wishes to leave Golmore, but Fran advises her against doing so, relating how her own independence has cost her her family and the ability to commune with the Wood. Fran accepts that she is now part of the Hume world, and asks for a confirmation from Jote that the Wood accepts her before she leaves. Jote replies that The Wood misses her child and is jealous of the hume that has taken her away. Fran smiles {{for the first time in}} the game, knowing her sister is lying and still cares for her, as she leaves The Wood for good. In Revenant Wings, Balthier and Fran are searching for the Cache of Glabados. Fran was voiced by Nicole Fantl in English and by Rika Fukami in Japanese. She also appears in Itadaki Street Portable.|$|E

25|$|The Andes {{also provide}} a ready source of {{irrigation}} which was historically done in flood plain style. Chilean vineyard owners would dig canals throughout their vineyards and then flood the entire surface area with water allowing some to seep {{into the ground and}} the <b>run</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> be funnel away through the canals. This encouraged excessive irrigation and high yields which had a negative effect on quality. During the wine renaissance of the 1980s & 1990s more vineyards converted to drip irrigation system which allowed greater control and helped reduce yields. The soil composition of Chile's vineyards varies from the clay dominated landscapes of Colchagua, which is thus heavily planted with the clay-loving Merlot, to the mixture of loam, limestone and sand found in other regions. In the southern Rapel and parts of Maule, tuffeau soil is present with volcanic soil being found in parts of Curico and Bio-Bio.|$|E

500|$|When Howard Hughes {{purchased}} {{the hotel in}} the mid-1960s for $14.6 million, the architect Martin Stern, Jr. added a 500-room circular tower, which opened in 1967, and the hotel became a Las Vegas landmark. Hughes grew particularly annoyed every time the Rat Pack were in his hotel, due to a hatred of Frank Sinatra which stemmed {{from the fact that}} he had been in love with Ava Gardner in the 50s and she had <b>run</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> marry him. The ill feeling was reciprocated by Sinatra. Hughes plotted to oust Sinatra from the Sands for good, and asked Robert Maheu to draw up a plan shortly after the new hotel opened in 1967. The hotel imposed restrictions on what Sinatra could gamble in the casino, to just $3,000 a night. Under previous management, Sinatra had no limits on the amount of credit extended to him by the Sands casino. [...] His IOUs, chits or [...] "markers" [...] were torn up at the end of Sinatra's engagements because he was considered to be good for business-bringing the hotel more monetary value than the worth of his gambling losses. Hughes put a stop to this system, telling Jack Entratter to inform Sinatra of the new policy; Entratter did not do so because he was afraid.|$|E
