Also, of course, the League, lacking its own army, could not coerce any state to adhere to its recommendations.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the British {{government}} {{comes under}} public pressure to <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> It becomes {{clear to the}} British diplomats assigned {{to find a solution}} that defeating the Burgundians through starvation is both difficult and unpopular with the British people, so they negotiate. The sticking point {{turns out to be the}} disposition of the unearthed treasure. Wix, now the Burgundian Chancellor of the Exchequer, suggests a Burgundian loan of the treasure to Britain. With the final piece of the deadlock eliminated, Burgundy reunites with Britain, which also sees the return of rationing for food and clothing to the area. The celebratory outdoor banquet is interrupted by heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|To <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of overcrowding, {{the station}} began upgrade works in 2017. This {{includes}} a new northern exit/entrance on the north-west corner of Victoria Street, accessible via a new additional ticket office under Bressenden Place leading {{to both the}} Victoria line and the Circle and District line platforms. This upgrade is due to be finished by 2018, and tunnelling for the project was completed in September 2015. The work involved enlarging the existing Victoria line ticket hall serving the railway station and add a new relief bank of escalators there, which opened in January 2017. The redevelopment has been criticised, as access to platforms from the new escalators will be long and indirect compared to the direct access using the existing escalators.|$|E

5|$|When the Central London Railway {{opened in}} 1900, it used {{camel-back}} electric locomotives hauling six-car trains. The locomotives weighed 44 tons and were largely unsprung, causing severe vibration problems in properties near the line. In {{an effort to}} <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> four of the coaches were fitted with motors, in the first trial in Britain of the Sprague-Thomson-Houston multiple unit control system. The trials were a success, and multiple unit trains were running by 1903. Two of the trial cars, numbers 201 and 202, were retained {{and became the first}} ballast motor cars to work on the Underground. They worked in this form until about 1910, when batteries were fitted. They were renumbered L22 and L23 in 1929, and were scrapped in 1936 and 1937.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, {{two years before}} US13 had been {{completed}} as a four-lane divided highway from Dover to Wilmington, Delawareans petitioned DSHD to extend the divided highway south to the Maryland state line at Selbyville or Delmar (US13), a proposition DSHD acknowledged but deferred {{due to lack of}} funding, lack of proper planning, and higher priorities elsewhere in the state. Instead of adding divided highway in southern Delaware, DSHD needed to <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of the deterioration of 15- to 25-year-old concrete roads, such as those along the DuPont Highway. The department planned to address the issue by patching the concrete surface as needed, adding concrete shoulders, and applying a layer of bituminous concrete, more commonly known as asphalt concrete or blacktop, over the entire width of concrete to provide a wearing surface.|$|E
5|$|By mid 1916, the {{situation}} was becoming increasingly pressing for the German army. With the appointment of Erich Ludendorff to commander of the General Staff, the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL), in August 1916, the German administration began actively considering the idea of forcibly deporting Belgian workers to Germany to <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> The policy, encouraged by {{the high levels of}} unemployment in occupied Belgium, marked a wider turn towards more oppressive rule by the German administration. The deportation begun in October 1916 and lasted until March 1917. In all, as many as 120,000 workers had been deported to Germany {{by the end of the}} war. Of these, around 2,500 died from the poor conditions in which the workers were held. In addition, in the Staging Zone, around 62,000 workers were conscripted as forced labour on local military projects in poor conditions.|$|E

5|$|In November, Fowler {{travelled}} to Frankfurt, Germany to see Dr. Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt, {{a specialist}} sports injuries doctor, {{to try and}} resolve a recurring hip problem that had left him lacking fitness in early season fixtures for the Bluebirds. The treatment involved taking around twenty-eight injections into his hip. He returned to full training in late November and made his comeback on 15 December as a late substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Bristol City. However {{he went on to}} suffer another injury blow just days later after a mistimed tackle in training from club captain Darren Purse left him with damaged ankle ligaments. Due to the new injury blow Cardiff and Fowler made plans for him to go to Colorado, United States to undergo keyhole surgery on the hip problem, which had plagued him in recent seasons, in the hope that it would finally <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of the {{excessive}} growth of phumdis {{that affects the}} lake ecosystem and local community, a study sponsored by the IndiaCanada Environment Facility was undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) to examine efficient ways of converting phumdis into briquettes as fodder and fuel pellets, {{which could be used}} to meet both energy demands within the region. Two options for the biomass conversion were studied. The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and crude protein content, but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% de-oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was densified to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to have an average calorific value of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with ash content of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E

50|$|Psychology {{professor}} Finn Tschudi's ABC {{model of}} psychotherapy uses a structure {{similar to a}} decisional balance sheet: A is a row that defines the problem; B is a row that lists schemas about {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> problem; and C is a row that lists schemas about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} maintaining <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Tschudi was partly inspired by Harold Greenwald's book Decision Therapy, which posited that much of psychotherapy involves helping people make decisions. In the ABC model, people are said to be blocked or stuck in resolving a problem when their C schemas define strong advantages to maintaining <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> and/or strong disadvantages to <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> and often their C schemas are at a low level of awareness.
