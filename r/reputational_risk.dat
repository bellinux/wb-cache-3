25|$|Regardless of the {{difficulty}} in measurement, {{the amount of money}} laundered each year is in the billions of US dollars and poses a significant policy concern for governments. As a result, governments and international bodies have undertaken efforts to deter, prevent, and apprehend money launderers. Financial institutions have likewise undertaken efforts to prevent and detect transactions involving dirty money, both as a result of government requirements and to avoid the <b>reputational</b> <b>risk</b> involved. Issues relating to money laundering have existed as long as there have been large scale criminal enterprises. Modern anti-money laundering laws have developed along with the modern War on Drugs. In more recent times anti-money laundering legislation is seen as adjunct to the financial crime of terrorist financing in that both crimes usually involve the transmission of funds through the financial system (although money laundering relates to where the money has come from, and terrorist financing relating to where the money is going to).|$|E

These investments targeted financial (credit, interest rate, and market) risk management.

The model is multi-attribute and hierarchical, and is composed of three modules: basic data processing, qualitative evaluation, aggregation; these are presented in detail. The paper also {{presents a}} prototype implementation of the model and illustrates its application on real-life data. ...|$|R
