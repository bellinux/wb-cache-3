5|$|An astute {{politician}} {{deeply involved}} with power issues in each state, Lincoln <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> War Democrats and managed his own re-election {{campaign in the}} 1864 presidential election. Anticipating the war's conclusion, Lincoln pushed a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation {{in the face of}} lingering and bitter divisiveness. On April 14, 1865, five days after the surrender of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth and died the next day. Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|In April 2016, it was {{announced}} that Black Country Communion would be reuniting in 2017 to record a fourth album.

Hughes and Bonamassa started writing new music for the forthcoming album in September, with recording beginning the following January. The album, entitled BCCIV, was released on September 22, 2017, and will be promoted at two UK shows in January 2018.|$|E
5|$|In other articles, more {{focus was}} placed on the fact that Sun Bowl {{officials}} reached out to other schools of interest upon receiving Lafayette College’s original rejection of the bid. As seen in the article by Amarillo Daily News on November 24, 1948, rather than calling out Lafayette's claim as a fallacy, the paper focused on the fact that no further arrangements could be made with Lafayette College once Texas Miners officials had already <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other schools.|$|E
25|$|During this election, {{political}} parties used technology in innovative ways <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> voters. Although SMS {{had been used}} during prior elections, {{political parties}} had realised that the rural and illiterate voters which form a majority couldn't read. Young and technology savvy politicians quickly realised that voice was <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rural community as they could speak their language. This turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be very interesting as two voice companies from India, TringMe and VoiceHawk played the pivotal role in <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> billion people of India.|$|R

5|$|The Fifth Ward Wardroom was {{constructed}} {{and used as}} a polling place and meeting hall in a critical time when Pawtucket was incorporated as a city before becoming the Major Walter G.

5|$|In Kaga, a {{civil war}} had broken out between Togashi Masachika and Kochiyo Masachika {{for control of the}} {{position}} of shugo over the province. Kochiyo was victorious against his brother and drove him out of Kaga. When the Ōnin War began in 1467, Masachika sided with the Hosokawa clan, while Kochiyo sided with the Yamana. Kochiyo also patronized Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival of the Hongan-ji school of which Rennyo was head. Masachika, seeking to reclaim his land, <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ikkō-ikki and asked for their support. In exchange, he promised to end their religious persecution and lift them out of poverty. The priests in Yoshizaki agreed to aid Masachika, and Rennyo, though alarmed by the rebellious attitude of the rebels, tacitly rendered his support as well. Asakura Toshikage, the ruler of Echizen and ally of the Hosokawa, also lent his support. Kochiyo was defeated, and Masachika restored to power.|$|E
5|$|The new ruler, Gheorghe Bibescu, {{released}} Bălcescu {{and other}} {{participants in the}} plot during 1843; soon afterwards, they became involved in founding a new Freemason-inspired secret society, known as Frăția ("The Brotherhood"), which was {{to serve as the}} central factor in the revolution. Early on, Frățias nucleus was formed by Bălcescu, Ion Ghica, Alexandru G. Golescu, and Major Christian Tell; by spring 1848, the leadership also included Dimitrie and Ion Brătianu, Constantin Bălcescu, Ștefan and Nicolae Golescu, Gheorghe Magheru, C. A. Rosetti, Ion Heliade Rădulescu, and Ioan Voinescu II. It was especially successful in Bucharest, where it also <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle class, and kept a legal facade as Soțietatea Literară (the Literary Society), whose meetings were attended by the Moldavians Vasile Alecsandri, Mihail Kogălniceanu, and Costache Negruzzi, {{as well as by the}} Austrian subject Constantin Daniel Rosenthal. During the early months of 1848, Romanian students at the University of Paris, including the Brătianu brothers, witnessed and, in some cases, took part in the French republican uprising.|$|E
