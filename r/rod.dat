The sharp point of the lightning <b>rod</b> would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron <b>rod</b> instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the <b>rod</b> directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E

Various types of fishing <b>rods</b> are designed for specific types of fishing.

Ice fishing <b>rods</b> are designed to fish through small holes in ice covered lakes. Trolling <b>rods</b> are designed to drag bait or lures behind moving boats.|$|R

5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein <b>rod</b> which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the <b>rod,</b> so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the <b>rod</b> slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E

5|$|Neutron {{penetration}} into materials makes californium {{useful in}} detection instruments such as fuel <b>rod</b> scanners; neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion, bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture; and in portable metal detectors. Neutron moisture gauges use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable neutron source for {{gold and silver}} prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground water movement. The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up (48.3%), fuel <b>rod</b> scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%). By 1994 most californium-252 was used in neutron radiography (77.4%), with fuel <b>rod</b> scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMetal spinal <b>rods</b> {{are used}} as {{fixation}} devices in spinal surgery. The attenuation effect of these <b>rods</b> has not been completely studied for patients with spinal <b>rods</b> and requiring spinal radiotherapy. AimThe {{purpose of the current}} study was to investigate the dosimetric perturbation effect of metallic spinal <b>rods</b> in different photon beams. Materials/MethodsThree photon beams of 6, 9 and 15 MV were modelled using MCNP 4 C Monte Carlo (MC) code. The geometry consisted of two spinal <b>rods</b> at a depth of 4 cm and a water phantom was used for MC calculations. The beam profiles at depths of 5. 5, 6. 5 and 7. 5 cm were calculated. ResultsDose reductions of 10. 2 – 11. 2 % and 5 – 6. 2 % were observed for steel and titanium <b>rods</b> respectively. The insertion of metallic <b>rods</b> into the photon beams did not change the spinal cord received dose but the effect of both types of <b>rods</b> on the target region behind the <b>rods</b> cannot be ignored, especially for steel <b>rods.</b> ConclusionsOur results suggest that for reliable spinal radiotherapy the dose attenuation effect of spinal <b>rods</b> {{must be taken into account}} in treatment planning calculations...|$|R

5|$|One {{possible}} fix is {{to consider}} collections of objects {{that can be easily}} divided, such as pies or, still better, segmented <b>rods.</b> Rather than just combining collections of segments, <b>rods</b> can be joined end-to-end, which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not the <b>rods</b> but the lengths of the <b>rods.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} of charge {{gives rise to}} an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity. A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass <b>rod</b> that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass <b>rod,</b> it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber <b>rod</b> also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass <b>rod,</b> and the other by an amber <b>rod,</b> the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated {{in the late eighteenth}} century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.|$|E
