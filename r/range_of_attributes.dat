2500|$|Polemics about humanism have {{sometimes}} assumed paradoxical twists and turns. Early 20th century critics such as Ezra Pound, T.E. Hulme, and T.S. Eliot considered humanism to be sentimental [...] "slop" [...] (Hulme) or [...] "an old bitch {{gone in the}} teeth" [...] (Pound) and {{wanted to go back}} to a more manly, authoritarian society such as existed in the Middle Ages. Postmodern critics who are self-described anti-humanists, such as Jean-François Lyotard and Michel Foucault, have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature, which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. [...] "Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal", suggests Timothy Laurie, turning the human into what he calls [...] "a placeholder for a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>attributes</b> that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger)". Nevertheless, philosopher Kate Soper notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals, anti-humanism thus frequently [...] "secretes a humanist rhetoric".|$|E

The results allow us to benchmark the magnitude of the number-of-levels effect against the range effect: conjoint importance estimates were approximately equally affected by a threefold increase in the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>attribute</b> variation and by the insertion <b>of</b> two intermediate <b>attribute</b> levels.
