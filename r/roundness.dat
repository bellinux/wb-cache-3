5|$|The {{existence}} of Reuleaux polygons shows that diameter measurements alone cannot verify that an object has a circular cross-section. Overlooking this fact {{may have played}} a role in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, as the <b>roundness</b> of sections of the rocket in that launch was tested only by measuring different diameters, and off-round shapes may cause unusually high stresses that could have been one of the factors causing the disaster.|$|E
5|$|According to an IAU draft resolution, the <b>roundness</b> {{condition}} generally {{results in}} {{the need for a}} mass of at least 5 kg, or diameter of at least 800km. However, Mike Brown claims that these numbers are only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in diameter. It all depends on the rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature. Assuming that Methone's shape reflects the balance between the tidal force exerted by Saturn and the moon's gravity, its tiny 3km diameter suggests Methone is composed of icy fluff.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of Andalusian horses is extended, elevated, cadenced and harmonious, with {{a balance of}} <b>roundness</b> and forward movement. Poor elevation, irregular tempo, and excessive winging (sideways {{movement of}} the legs from the knee down) are discouraged by breed registry standards. Andalusians {{are known for their}} agility and their ability to learn difficult moves quickly, such as advanced collection and turns on the haunches. A 2001 study compared the kinematic characteristics of Andalusian, Arabian and Anglo-Arabian horses while moving at the trot. Andalusians were found to overtrack less (the degree to which the hind foot lands ahead of the front hoof print) but also exhibit greater flexing of both fore and hind joints, movement consistent with the more elevated way of going typically found in this breed. The authors of the study theorized that these characteristics of the breed's trot may contribute to their success as a riding and dressage horse.|$|E
5|$|The spire can {{be divided}} into three sections. The lower section, which is the base, is formed of seven {{superimposed}} layers, each layer representing a level of heaven in accordance with the Traiphum Buddhist cosmology. The middle section is {{in the shape of a}} bell; however the <b>roundness</b> has been flattened to create a four sided shape. This represents the stupa in which the Buddha's ashes have been interred. The top section is similar to the top of chedis, depicting a tapered lotus bud or the crystal dew drop signifying the escape from the Saṃsāra or cycle of rebirths. The spire is supported by garudas on its four sides; as well as being the symbol of kingship, the garuda represents the mythical creatures of the Himavanta forest surrounding Mount Meru.|$|E
5|$|Many {{performances}} {{deal with}} behaviors {{that occur in}} daily life. However, {{in accordance with the}} overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of Mo, mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is <b>roundness.</b> Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals of orientation often {{take the form of a}} smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.|$|E
25|$|After network executives, {{especially}} {{executive producer}} Gail Berman, criticized her appearance and the <b>roundness</b> of her face, Cho starved herself for several weeks.

25|$|The <b>roundness</b> {{points to}} the fact that it was based on Arabic script.

25|$|For example, the <b>roundness</b> of {{the city}} of Baghdad in the Abbasid era, points to its Persian precedents, such as Firouzabad in Fars. Al-Mansur hired two {{designers}} to plan the city's design: Naubakht, a former Persian Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation {{of the city}} should be astrologically significant, and Mashallah ibn Athari, a former Jew from Khorasan.|$|E
25|$|In the Zenú culture, {{women were}} {{the symbol of}} fertility, wisdom and respect. Female {{characters}} were frequently portrayed in clay {{and placed in the}} graves of the dead as a symbol of human and agricultural fertility. The presence of these statuettes in the grave symbolized conception and rebirth in the underworld, {{in the same way that}} seeds germinate and grow. During the funeral ceremony, which was attended by the whole community with music and dance, a mound was built over the grave. On top of the mound a tree was planted, and golden bells were hung in the branches. The golden breastplates that important women and chiefs wore during ceremonies symbolized the pregnancy of women and the virility of men. The <b>roundness</b> of the mound, like the <b>roundness</b> of a breastplate, was an allusion to the place where pregnancy and birth took place. Thus, women possessed great social and political significance. When the Zenú culture was discovered by the Spaniards in the 16th century, the religious center of Finzenú at the river Sinú was led by Toto, a female chief who governed several nearby villages.|$|E
25|$|The global {{composition}} is highly geometricized, with various planes, angles, layers and facets, as are specific elements depicted on the trompe-l'œil wooden {{table in the}} foreground (as if seen from above). The <b>roundness</b> and shading of the mans attire (particularly in the sleeves) stands {{in sharp contrast to}} the angular momentum engendered by the overall cubic construction of the piece; while the chairs in the lower half of the work and flowered wallpaper of the background are treaded in comparatively naturalistic detail, similar to the backgrounds of late 19th century portraits.|$|E
25|$|Blowing {{over the}} edge of a jug or bottle can create a nearly pure tone of low frequency. The driving force is the flow over the jug edge so one might expect an edge tone dipole sound field. In this case, The {{curvature}} and <b>roundness</b> of the edge makes a strong edge tone unlikely. Any periodicity at the edge is likely submerged in the Class III feedback from the jug volume. The unsteady edge flow sets up a classical Helmholtz resonator response in which the interior geometry and the jug neck determines the resultant frequency. A resonance equation is shown below.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} {{fermentation}}, {{the wine}} may also have malolactic fermentation or FML. This second fermentation carried out by bacteria deacidifies the wine: it transforms the malic acid, which has two carboxyl groups, into lactic acid. This operation, which reduces the biting acidity of the wine, is not always desirable nor practiced. In southern areas the acidity is carefully preserved to give the wine its liveliness for refreshing Aroma of wine. During the fermentation of the grapes varietal aromas are reduced in favour {{of an increase in}} <b>roundness</b> and volume in the mouth of the wine during ageing in oak barrels. It gives a better biological stability in champagne wines.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} painters of northern Italy was Andrea Mantegna of Padua, who {{had the good fortune to}} be in his teen years at the time in which the great Florentine sculptor Donatello was working there. Donatello created the enormous equestrian bronze, the first since the Roman Empire, of the condotiero Gattemelata, still visible on its plinth in the square outside the Basilica of Sant'Antonio. He also worked on the high altar and created a series of bronze panels in which he achieved a remarkable illusion of depth, with perspective in the architectural settings and apparent <b>roundness</b> of the human form all in very shallow relief.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have pointed out}} a problem facing Aristotle's theory of soul-body hylomorphism. According to Aristotle, a living thing's matter is its body, which needs a soul {{in order to be}} alive. Similarly, a bronze sphere's matter is bronze, which needs <b>roundness</b> in order to be a sphere. Now, bronze remains the same bronze after ceasing to be a sphere. Therefore, it seems that a body should remain the same body after death. However, Aristotle implies that a body is no longer the same body after death. Moreover, Aristotle says that a body that has lost its soul is no longer potentially alive. But if a living thing's matter is its body, then that body should be potentially alive by definition.|$|E
25|$|James Hillman, {{founder of}} archetypal psychology, has {{done much to}} expose the {{unacknowledged}} or shadow “Christianisms” within Jungian depth psychology itself. For example: One barrier to grasping the underworld or domain of Hades as the psychic realm is Christ’s victory over death. Similarly, the model for viewing the shadow as a moral problem is the Christian doctrine of sin. Hillman believes that soul or interiority refers not only to humans but to inanimate objects and to the world. Hillman is critical of Jung’s convention of equating symbols of <b>roundness</b> (e.g. the rose window of a cathedral) with the Self, and discourages the attempt to achieve undivided wholeness by integrating parts. Jung’s Self (representing the inner God) derives from monotheism, and by contrast Hillman encourages a polytheistic perspective.|$|E
25|$|Hua Jin 化劲 ('Transforming Jin') - This is {{considered}} the highest stage of practice. You must have already grasped the stages of Ming Jin and An Jin and {{have a very strong}} foundation in them.

Use 'Zhan, Lian, Nian, and Sui' (sticky, link, adhering, and complying). Everywhere you need to be empty and not exerting strength.

500|$|The 2006 IAU {{definition}} presents some {{challenges for}} exoplanets because {{the language is}} specific to the Solar System and because the criteria of <b>roundness</b> and orbital zone clearance are not presently observable. [...] Astronomer Jean-Luc Margot proposed a mathematical criterion that determines whether an object can clear its orbit during the lifetime of its host star, based on {{the mass of the}} planet, its semimajor axis, and the mass of its host star. [...] This formula produces a value π that is greater than 1 for planets. [...] The eight known planets and all known exoplanets have π values above 100, while Ceres, Pluto, and Eris have π values of 0.1 or less. [...] Objects with π values of 1 or more are also expected to be approximately spherical, so that objects that fulfill the orbital zone clearance requirement automatically fulfill the <b>roundness</b> requirement.|$|E
500|$|Several of Leguat's {{observations}} were later confirmed through study of subfossil Rodrigues solitaire remains. The curved contour {{lines of the}} pelvis also support the <b>roundness</b> of its hind parts, which he {{compared to that of}} a horse. Also, a ridged surface appears {{at the base of the}} beak, indicating the position of the caruncular ridge, which Leguat described as a [...] "widow's peak". Before fossils of the carpal knob were found, Strickland noted that the keel of the sternum of the Rodrigues solitaire was so well-developed as to almost indicate it had possessed the power of flight; however, since the humerus was very short he inferred that this was instead related to Leguat's claim that they used their wings for defence.|$|E
500|$|Book XIV covers geography, {{describing}} the Earth, islands, promontories, mountains and caves. The earth {{is divided into}} three parts, Asia occupying half the globe, and Europe and Africa each occupying a quarter. Europe is separated from Africa by the Mediterranean, reaching in from the Ocean that flows all around the land. Isidore writes that the orbis of the earth, translated by Barney as [...] "globe", [...] "derives its name from the <b>roundness</b> of the circle, because it resembles a wheel; hence a small wheel is called a 'small disk' (orbiculus)". Barney notes that orbis [...] "refers to the 'circle' of lands around the Mediterranean, and hence to the total known extent of land." [...] Isidore illustrated the Etymologies with a circular T-O map which also gave a vague impression of a flat disc-shaped Earth, though authors disagree about Isidore's beliefs on the matter.|$|E
500|$|Riesling is {{on record}} as being planted in the Alsace region by 1477 when its quality was praised by the Duke of Lorraine. Today over a fifth of Alsace's {{vineyards}} are covered with Riesling vines, mostly in the Haut-Rhin district, with the varietal [...] being very different from neighboring German Riesling. This is partly from difference in the soil with the clay Alsatian soil being more dominately calcareous than the slate composition of Rheingau. The other differences come in wine making styles, with the Alsatian preferring more French-oriented methods that produce wines of higher alcohol content (normally around 12%) and more <b>roundness</b> due to longer time spent in neutral oak barrels or steel tanks. In contrast to German wine laws, Alsatian rieslings can be chaptalized, {{a process in which}} the alcoholic content is increased through the addition of sugar to the must.|$|E

500|$|Nansen {{wanted the}} ship in one year; {{he was eager to}} get away before anyone else could adopt his ideas and {{forestall}} him. [...] The ship's most significant external feature was the <b>roundness</b> of the hull, designed so that there was nothing upon which the ice could get a grip. Bow, stern and keel were rounded off, and the sides smoothed so that, in Nansen's words, the vessel would [...] "slip like an eel out of the embraces of the ice". [...] To give exceptional strength the hull was sheathed in South American greenheart, the hardest timber available. The three layers of wood forming the hull provided a combined thickness of between 24 and 28inches (60–70cm), increasing to around 48inches (1.25metres) at the bow, which was further protected by a protruding iron stem. Added strength was provided by crossbeams and braces throughout the length of the hull.|$|E
500|$|The Nigella Bites series, {{which was}} filmed {{in her home}} in west London, was later {{broadcast}} on American television channels E! and Style Network. Lawson said of the US release, [...] "In the UK, my viewers {{have responded to the}} fact I'm trying to reduce, not add to, their burden and I'm looking forward to making that connection with Style viewers across the US". Overall, Lawson was well received in the United States. Those who did criticise her often suggested she was too flirtatious; a commentator from The New York Times said, [...] "Lawson's sexy <b>roundness</b> mixed with her speed-demon technique makes cooking dinner with Nigella look like a prelude to an orgy". The book of Nigella Bites became the second bestselling cook book of Christmas 2002 in America. The series was followed by Forever Summer with Nigella in 2002 on Channel 4, the concept being, [...] "that you cook to make you still feel as though you're on holiday". Fellow food writer Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall condemned the conceit as [...] "cynical and reckless" [...] and referred to the book as Fuck Seasonality.|$|E
500|$|However, {{there is}} no precise point at which an object {{can be said to}} have reached {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium. As Soter noted in his article, [...] "how are we to quantify the degree of <b>roundness</b> that distinguishes a planet? Does gravity dominate such a body if its shape deviates from a spheroid by 10 percent or by 1 percent? Nature provides no unoccupied gap between round and nonround shapes, so any boundary would be an arbitrary choice." [...] Furthermore, the point at which an object's mass compresses it into an ellipsoid varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object. Objects made of ices, such as Enceladus and Miranda, assume that state more easily than those made of rock, such as Vesta and Pallas. Heat energy, from gravitational collapse, impacts, tidal forces, or radioactive decay, also factors into whether an object will be ellipsoidal or not; Saturn's icy moon Mimas is ellipsoidal, but Neptune's larger moon Proteus, which is similarly composed but colder because of its greater distance from the Sun, is irregular. In addition, the much larger Iapetus is ellipsoidal but does not have the dimensions expected for its current speed of rotation, indicating that it was once in hydrostatic equilibrium but no longer is.|$|E
500|$|The type {{species of}} Amphicoelias, A. altus, was named by {{paleontologist}} Edward Drinker Cope in December 1877 (though not published until 1878) for an incomplete skeleton {{consisting of two}} vertebrae, a pubis (hip bone), and a femur (upper leg bone). Cope also named a second species, A. fragillimus, in the same paper. However, all subsequent researchers have considered A. fragillimus to be a synonym of A. altus. Even by 1881 however, it was recognized that A. altus could not be distinguished from other genera, as the features described by Cope were misinterpreted and are widespread. In 1921, Osborn and Mook assigned additional bones to A. altus—a scapula (shoulder blade), a coracoid (shoulder bone), an ulna (lower arm bone), and a tooth. Henry Fairfield Osborn and Charles Craig Mook noted the overall close similarity between Amphicoelias and Diplodocus, {{as well as a}} few key differences, such as proportionally longer forelimbs in Amphicoelias than in Diplodocus. The dentition of Amphicoelias is homodont. Its teeth are shaped like long slender cylindrical rods, are spaced apart and project forward towards the front of the mouth. The femur of Amphicoelias is unusually long, slender, and round in cross section; while this <b>roundness</b> was once thought to be another distinguishing characteristic of Amphicoelias, it has since been found in some specimens of Diplodocus as well. A. altus was also similar in size to Diplodocus, estimated to be about [...] long. While most scientists have used these details to distinguish Amphicoelias and Diplodocus as separate genera, at least one has suggested that Amphicoelias is probably the senior synonym of Diplodocus.|$|E
500|$|In the Starry Messenger, Galileo {{reported}} that stars appeared as mere blazes of light, essentially unaltered in appearance by the telescope, and contrasted them to planets, which the telescope {{revealed to be}} discs. But shortly thereafter, in his Letters on Sunspots, he {{reported that}} the telescope revealed the shapes of both stars and planets to be [...] "quite round". From that point forward, he continued to report that telescopes showed the <b>roundness</b> of stars, and that stars seen through the telescope measured {{a few seconds of}} arc in diameter. He also devised a method for measuring the apparent size of a star without a telescope. As described in his Dialogue Concerning the two Chief World Systems, his method was to hang a thin rope in his line of sight to the star and measure the maximum distance from which it would wholly obscure the star. From his measurements of this distance and of the width of the rope, he could calculate the angle subtended by the star at his viewing point. In his Dialogue, he reported that he had found the apparent diameter of a star of first magnitude to be no more than 5 arcseconds, and that of one of sixth magnitude to be about 5/6 arcseconds. Like most astronomers of his day, Galileo did not recognise that the apparent sizes of stars that he measured were spurious, caused by diffraction and atmospheric distortion (see seeing disk or Airy disk), and did not represent the true sizes of stars. However, Galileo's values were much smaller than previous estimates of the apparent sizes of the brightest stars, such as those made by Tycho Brahe (see Magnitude) and enabled Galileo to counter anti-Copernican arguments such as those made by Tycho that these stars would have to be absurdly large for their annual parallaxes to be undetectable. Other astronomers such as Simon Marius, Giovanni Battista Riccioli, and Martinus Hortensius made similar measurements of stars, and Marius and Riccioli concluded the smaller sizes were not small enough to answer Tycho's argument.|$|E
