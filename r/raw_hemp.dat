40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to gain more information about antibody production against novel and commonly exposed proteins, using hemp seed flour protein (from Cannabis Sativa plant) as a novel protein source. In this trial, two groups of eight domestic shorthair cats were fed with different diets, a basal canned diet mixed with <b>raw</b> <b>hemp</b> seed flour protein (diet 1) or diet 2 in which the canned diet was first mixed with hemp seed flour and heated afterwards. Antibody production was measured via indirect ELISA, using tree antigens (basal diet extract, raw hemps seed flour extract and heated hemp diet extract) and cats sera of 3 time moments (day 0, 11 and 25 after starting diets). Using raw or heated hemp protein in the diets, the effects of canning (heating) the hemp protein could also be reviewed. Based on results of indirect ELISA robust IgG antibodies were found against all the antigens in both group of cats. This is not in line with oral tolerance theory, in which cats should have lower antibody levels against commonly exposed proteins like the basal diet extract. Some differences were found between IgG levels against hemp protein between the two groups, with a possible explanation that cannabidiol from the hemp seed flour extract induced immune stimulation in the group receiving non-processed, <b>raw</b> <b>hemp</b> diet (diet 1). For more confirmation and clarification about antibody production against dietary proteins in cats, further research is necessary consisting of optimizing ELISA experiments and results...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{microbial}} pretreatment on hemp fibres were evaluated after microbial retting using the white rot fungi Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Phlebia radiata Cel 26 and water retting. Based on chemical composition, P. radiata Cel 26 showed the highest selectivity for pectin and lignin degradation and lowest cellulose loss (14 %) {{resulting in the}} highest cellulose content (78. 4 %) for the treated hemp fibres. The pectin and lignin removal after treatment with P. radiata Cel 26 were of the order 82 % and 50 %, respectively. Aligned epoxy-matrix composites were made from hemp fibres defibrated with the microbial retting to evaluate the effects on their ultrastructure. SEM microscopy of the composites showed low porosity on the fibre surfaces after defibration with P. radiata Cel 26 and C. subvermispora indicating good epoxy polymer impregnation. In contrast, fibres treated by water retting and the <b>raw</b> <b>hemp</b> fibres were badly impregnated due to porosity caused by surface impurities such as epidermis and other pectin rich plant cells. The pectin and lignin mainly located in the outer part of the fibres were assumed to be extracted and degraded by pectinase and peroxidase enzymes produced by the fungi...|$|E
40|$|Allergic {{reactions}} to food {{are common in}} human and veterinary medicine. The objective {{of this research is}} to characterize the immune response of healthy cats to their basal diet and to a novel introduced dietary protein. Besides this, the effects of heating (processing) on antigenic potential have been studied. Two groups of each eight domestic shorthair cats participated in this study. During four weeks one group was fed a basal diet with <b>raw</b> <b>hemp</b> seed (novel protein), the other group was fed a basal diet and hemp seed heated together. SDS page was used to investigate the protein content of both diets, and Western blot was used to investigate the immune response to proteins in the basal diet, hemp seed and heated hemp diet. The SDS page of hemp seed showed distinct bands (50 kDa, 46 kDa, 33 kDa, 31 kDa and 19 kDa), but no distinct bands could be seen for the two diets. Western blot showed no antibody binding. This could be due to lack of antibody, but probably errors in the process caused this failure. More research is necessary to investigate which specific dietary proteins stimulate antibody production. Many of the methods should be refined to provide a scientifically significant evidence for the antibodies produced by cats as a response to specific contents of their food...|$|E

50|$|Colebrooke was a Director of the East India Company from 1767-1771 and 1772-1773, Deputy Chairman 1768-1769 and {{was elected}} Chairman three times, in 1769, 1770 and 1772.

He lost much larger sums, however, speculating on prices of <b>raw</b> materials - <b>hemp,</b> flax, lead, logwood and alum among others. In 1771 he lost £190,000 dealing in hemp; from 1772 he was attempting to corner the world's supply of alum, buying up mines in Yorkshire and Lancashire, and saw much of the remainder of his fortune swallowed up when the market collapsed as part of a wider financial crisis.|$|R
40|$|Biomass {{represents}} {{an important source}} {{for the production of}} multiple products including high-value chemicals. In this context, different lignocellulosic residues have been explored for the extraction of aromatic monomers. It includes ultrasonic extraction, refluxing extraction, alkaline hydrolysis and accelerated solvent extraction [1]. Aromatic monomers could be used for food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical applications. Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is an annual herbaceous plant. The natural fractions resulting from the industrial transformation of hemp are hemp fiber and its two co-products hemp wood and hemp dust. 5, 500 tons of hemp wood and 2, 300 tons of hemp dust are produced from the transformation of 10, 000 tons of <b>raw</b> material. <b>Hemp</b> fiber is largely used in paper, for clothing and for the manufacture and reinforcing of every type of composites. Hemp wood and dust are used in gardening, stockbreeding and as litter for animals because of their high absorption capacity. Developing higher value-added applications from these natural by-products would secure the hemp sector. As these coproducts are rich in lignin, the extraction of aromatic monomers in particular ferulic and coumaric acids can represent an interesting valorization for hemp wood and dust. Characterization of this two coproducts using Van Soest method provided a value of 86. 8 % in lignocellulosic materials (50. 6 % cellulose, 18. 2 % hemicelluloses and 18. 0 % lignin) for hemp wood compared to 61. 7 % in lignocellulosic materials (43. 9 % cellulose, 10. 7 % hemicelluloses and 7. 0 % lignin) for hemp dust. Total phenolic compounds and aromatic monomers were evaluated using Folin-Ciocalteu method and HPLC-UV-vis analysis, respectively. In this work, twin-screw extrusion method has been developed to extract aromatic monomers in hemp wood and dust. Twin-screw extrusion is a continuous extraction system using thermo-mechano-chemical effects [2, 3]. The influence of experimental conditions, such as screw profile, solvent, liquid/solid ratio and temperature on extraction efficiency was studied for hemp wood and dust. High yields of aromatic compounds were obtained at low temperature and liquid/solid ratio using alkaline ethanol. Twin-screw extrusion gives promising results to obtain aromatic monomers of interest from hemp coproducts...|$|R
25|$|Currently {{there is}} a small niche market for hemp pulp, for example as {{cigarette}} paper. Hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp. In 1994 there was no significant production of 100% true hemp paper. World hemp pulp production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05% of the world's annual pulp production volume. The total world production of hemp fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons. This can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp, mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the Western world, and because hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (mostly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles. Another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production. While the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees, only about 25% of the dried hemp stem—the bark, called bast—contains the long, strong fibers desirable for paper production. All this accounts for a high <b>raw</b> material cost. <b>Hemp</b> pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide, a process today also commonly used for wood pulp.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Design)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2008 This thesis {{argues that}} the story of hemp is one of mistaken {{identity}} and focuses on the potential of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) in a social and economic context. It also asserts how hemp with the application of appropriate technologies can be developed nationally 'new' material, with reference to examples from abroad. The current proliferation of raw material shortages means that designers have a social responsibility to seek new ways to source and process materials for a sustainable future. Designers are the "future creators" and should prescribe materials that are not only healthy in the cycle of production, but also ensure an afterlife (recycling). The methodology employed is a combination of qualitative (such as interviews) and quantitative methods (such as statistical analysis). Life Cycle Analysis is used to study the ecological impact of substituting hemp for current materials and processes. The study interrogates the historic significance of hemp in various societies across the world with particular focus on Europe, Japan, the United States of America, Ireland and Australia. Such information is analysed within the realities of the South African context. A vast amount of information on hemp has been published but practical information is hard to obtain in South Africa necessitating a search for definite answers abroad, mainly in Europe where there is a strong development in this field. After researching the production of the <b>hemp</b> <b>raw</b> materials and the manufacture of viable hemp products abroad, lessons could be assessed for application to the local market. The findings endorse the view that hemp is a sustainable zero-waste material; the whole plant can be used when harvested, which makes it an ideal material on which to base an eco-design system. Hemp can be processed by utilizing either high technology equipment or by the use of locally available equipment and manual labour. It can be converted into a multi-diverse range of viable products such as paper, thatching, building material and ceiling panels. The main reason for the isolation of hemp in South Africa is the mistaken assumption that it is a drug and outlawed by our legislation. Since hemp (Cannabis sativa L) is perceived as a vilified cousin of marihuana it has lead to a blanket ban on both plants. This is certainly not warranted as hemp produces an extremely low value of the controversial hallucinogenic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) properties which is negligible...|$|R
