50|$|The {{aesthetic}} and ethical {{implications of the}} use of digital technology for film preservation are major subjects of debate. For instance, the senior curator of George Eastman House Paolo Cherchi Usai has decried the shift from analogue to digital preservation of film as ethically unacceptable, arguing, on philosophical terms, that the medium of film is an essential ontological precondition for the existence of cinema. More recently, the senior curator of EYE Film Institute Netherlands Giovanna Fossati has discussed the use of digital technologies for the restoration and preservation of film in a more optimistic way as a form of remediation of the cinematic medium, and has positively reflected on digital technologies' ability to broaden <b>restoration</b> <b>possibilities,</b> improve quality, and reduce costs. According to the cinema scholar Leo Enticknap, the views held by Usai and Fossati could be seen as representative of the two poles of the digital debate in film preservation. It should be kept in mind, however, that both Usai and Fossati's arguments are highly complex and nuanced, and likewise, the debate about the utility of digital technologies in film preservation is complex and continually evolving.|$|E

Exposure from combined environmental stressors intruding {{into the home}} could {{increase the risk of}} adverse effects on wellbeing, even when the exposure is at a relatively low level. This study assesses the prevalence of annoyance with a combination of potential environmental stressors common in urban areas and the association with wellbeing. A questionnaire was sent by mail to residents in five areas in Halmstad (Sweden) with similar socioeconomic and housing characteristics but different exposure (response rate 56 %; n = 385). Of the respondents, 50 % were annoyed to some degree by {{at least one of the}} suggested stressors, most commonly by noise and vibration from local traffic. Structural equation modelling showed that annoyance led to lowered quality of life via the mediating construct residential satisfaction, which in turn was influenced by place attachment and perceived <b>restoration</b> <b>possibilities</b> in the dwelling. Stress had a negative impact on quality of life, but was not directly correlated to annoyance. Stress was however correlated with sensitivity.

A total of 75 (20 x 20 m) quadrats were sampled. Diameter at breast height ≥ 2 cm and stem height ≥ 2 m were measured for all woody species encountered and the number of seedlings and saplings were counted. Elevation, slope and aspect were also recorded. At the center of each quadrat, a 10 x 10 cm plot was marked and three separate soil layers were collected and incubated in a glasshouse for 12 months. Data was analyzed using a combination of analytical methods, such as descriptive statistics, correlation of environmental variables with seedling density using R-Software and ordination techniques using software for Multivariate Analysis of Ecological Data (PC-ORD). A total of 72 woody species from standing vegetation and 60 plant species from incubated soil seed bank were identified.

This paper identifies the restoration objectives of wetland aiming to protect ecological and economic values and development as well as the water resources of the Yellow River. The hydraulic and groundwater coupling model and Landscape Ecological Decision and Evaluation Support System (LEDESS) of the Yellow River Delta were established to calculate environmental flows of degraded wetlands. LEDESS is a computer-based model developed and used to assess and evaluate the effects of land-use changes on nature. In this study, LEDESS is used to assess and evaluate the ecological effects and the <b>restoration</b> <b>possibilities</b> considering several environmental flows' supplement scenarios. This included the changes of suitable habitat conditions and its ecological carrying capacities for indicator species, e. g., Red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis), Oriental stork (Ciconia boyciana), and Saunder's gull (Larus relictus), and changing of ecological patterns. The results showed that replenishing fresh water to wetlands is one of the effective adaptive measures to mitigate wetland degradation and improve its habitat quality and carrying capacities. This study indicated that landscape ecology approach is not only considered as a good way to solve complex problems in ecosystem management but also can be used to decide on the environmental flows and assess its ecological effects in large-scale wetland rehabilitation. This integrated method could make environmental flows estimated and assessment more rational than the results of hydrologic methods. It could assist decision makers to "see" the ecological effects after water supplementing and so alleviate the contradictions between environmental flows and production water demands, and can facilitate the implementation of environmental flows in most countries with water resources shortage...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Ecological {{restoration}} {{is defined}} as active intervention and management to restore biotic communities that were formerly present at a particular place and time. Examples are given from both New Zealand and overseas {{of a variety of}} different <b>restoration</b> projects. The <b>possibility</b> is raised of replacing some animal species extinct in New Zealand with related living forms from other countries. The arguments for devoting resources to ecological restoration include creation of educational assets, aesthetic benefits, and scientific opportunities. They also include the maintenance of native plants and animals for environmental repair and enhancement work, and genetic conservation at the species and infraspecific levels. Thus ecological restoration is a means of restoring biological diversity to depleted landscapes and, as a consequence, can increase the variety of ways in which people appreciate nature. Ecological restoration of lost biotic communities should be seen as complementary to the protection of those remaining: both activities are needed in a comprehensive approach to nature conservation...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen the {{development}} of a post-colonial museum praxis in which research and authority is shared between indigenous people and museums. With these new developments suggestions of collection management en <b>restoration</b> <b>possibilities</b> have made questions of authenticity within these ethnographic objects necessary. Authenticity is a concept which cannot be limited to several criteria, since questions concerning authenticity of objects van only be answered within their own cultural context. Developed definitions of authenticity are culture specific, and the application of western notions of authenticity to ethnographic objects poses difficulties. Since there is not one definition of authenticity which can be applied to ethnographic objects, research must be performed on an object per object basis, which makes this kind of research a costly one. This is emphasised by several museum professionals who have practical experience with these questions from a museum context. They emphasised the importance of cultural background and open communication with indigenous people in discovering the authenticity of collections and planning for future management. Questions of authenticity can only arise when there is the possibility that there is inauthenticity. Those inauthentic objects were at first thought to be hybrid objects; objects made within indigenous culture but using materials external to that society. The interviewed disagreed and stressed the importance of these objects in the understanding of contact between indigenous communities and cultural change within this modern world. Application of both the theories of authenticity and the opinions of the interviewed to two case-studies confirmed the difficulties of the concept of authenticity within ethnographic objects. From the case-studies {{it became clear that the}} objects could not be considered authentic on the criteria presented by Lowenthal in 1992. Although the concept of authenticity of context seemed to provide the best opportunities, it still did not consider the fact that in modern museum practice indigenous communities reengage with their ancestral objects in museum collections. This makes clear that for application to ethnographic objects new considerations of authenticity are necessary. 	As Gustaaf Verswijver stated during the interview, if indigenous people consider an object as authentic within their own cultural context, this view should not be contested within a museum context. The application of concepts and theories of authenticity to museum is a complex matter, but studies which are focussed on this topic will enrich not only knowledge about collections but also might be used to strengthen bonds between museums and source communities. Therefore it should be more common in museums to research all aspects of their collections authenticity...|$|E

This review focuses on recent pathogenetic findings and on emerging therapeutic approaches. RECENT FINDINGS: Basic research is providing novel insights into the complex molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. Several mechanisms have been identified that mediate neuronal dysfunction and death; these include neuronal aggregation of the mutated protein, transcriptional dysregulation, excitotoxicity, altered energy metabolism, impaired axonal transport, and altered synaptic transmission. Recent experimental works have identified potential new therapeutic targets. In particular, they emphasize the role of altered histone modifications in transcriptional dysregulation, the synergistic action of glutamatergic and dopaminergic pathways in inducing excitotoxicity, the neuroprotective effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and transport <b>restoration,</b> and the <b>possibility</b> of reducing {{the expression of the}} mutant protein huntingtin and its deleterious effects by using short interfering mRNAs.

But the decrease in population density in beach restoration site (where E. minor disappeared, as survey results showed in September, 2014) could be a proxy for some tentative explanation: even if the cycles could be natural events it’s interesting to underline that both species did not recover after beach <b>restoration.</b> So the <b>possibility</b> that beach <b>restoration</b> can be at least in part responsible for the simultaneous absence of Ensis and Solen should be taken in account...|$|R

Restoration degradatsionnye properties NiTi-nSi in diodes Shottki (DSH) are connected with {{change of structure}} amorphous Ni 35 Ti 65 an alloy, time the basic stage of process annealing "cures " the damaged diodes. The experimental results proving <b>possibility</b> <b>restoration</b> and managements in parametres silicon SE by means of ultrasonic processing (UP) are considered. Restoration electrophysical and photo-electric properties SE with UP broken an irradiation are connected from a regrouping and athermic annealing the radiating defects formed γ in-quanta. The experimental results demonstrating the ability to influence and control ¬ leniya parameters of silicon solar cells by sonication (RCD). The possibility of partial recovery of photovoltaic properties of solar cells that disturbed- irradiation with ultrasonic treatment. C to investigate the impact of RCD on {{the change in the}} mechanism of charge transport, after each step of ultrasonic treatment, we measured the photovoltaic characteristics and temperature dependence of current-voltage characteristics of silicon solar cells [SC] in the forward and reverse current. The temperature was varied from 80 K to 350 K...|$|R
40|$|Object: To {{study the}} CAD/CAM systems’ {{possibilities}} for manufacturing Zirconia indirect restorations for restoring vital, vastly devastated teeth. Material and methods: Five patients with vital, heavily destroyed molars {{were included in}} the clinical study. The teeth were prepared according to requirements for Zirconia restorations. The impressions were taken with 3 D intraoral scanner. The acquired data is transmitted electronically for designing the future restoration by the CAD software. After designing, the restoration is milled by the CAM module and sintered, according to a specially projected programme in accordance with the manufacturing demands. After clinical check-up, the restorations are glazed, air-blasted and cemented. Results: Setting up an individual protocol for working with CAD/CAM systems for restoring vital, severely devastated teeth with Zirconia indirect restorations. A research is made on 3 D digital scanning, occlusal and proximal modeling, virtual articulation, analyzing the incline of the cavity walls, the thickness of the <b>restoration</b> and the <b>possibilities</b> for restoring the anatomy of the tooth according to patient’s individual characteristics of the teeth’s arch. Conclusion: The scanning and design process should be evaluated with the same quality control as when using traditional methods. The CAD software requires excellent preparation of the tooth cavity and digital scanning. This is the reason why these systems require a thorough understanding of CAD/CAM calibration and parameters of the product to be clinically acceptable. Once understood, CAD/CAM dentistry can create detailed and accurate restorations that function and perform with great success and longevity...|$|R
