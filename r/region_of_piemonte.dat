40|$|This paper aims at {{studying}} {{the relationship between}} fertility and migration, considering women moved from the North-East Italian <b>region</b> <b>of</b> Veneto in the 1950 s. A quite innovative approach lies on the matching between own children method and event history analysis; this allows to consider current status data, {{such as those of}} the 1981 population census, to know demographic events. A piecewise constant exponential model studies the birth of the first child for women aged 30 - 34 moved towards the North-West Italian <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Piemonte</b> and Lombardia.

A quite innovative approach lies on the matching between own children method and event history analysis; this allows us to consider current status data, {{such as those of}} the 1981 population census, to know demographic events. Piecewise constant exponential models are used to study the birth of the first child for women aged 30 - 34 (at the census) moved from Veneto towards the North-West Italian <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Piemonte</b> and Lombardia.

40|$|This work {{wants to}} {{initiate}} a reflection about the institution and progress of Landscape Observatories in the Italian context as instruments which are trying to give an operative support to landscape management. In particular this study will debate {{the problem of the}} definition and the lack of a common legislative direction, which at the moment has created the most of problems with the correct activation of these supporting instruments and the application of the European Landscape Convention. The most significant cases about the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Piemonte,</b> Puglia and Veneto will be analyzed. The comparison between different local Observatories has been performed (by) analyzing the basic theoretical conditions, the operative choices and the social attitudes that emerged towards the Landscape asset, the territory and the inhabitants. Finally it has been highlighted how these landscape management efforts, if interconnected and linked with other experiences, could begin a new way of understanding the administration, the development and the transformations of the territory...|$|R

Leaving the border it flows eastward in Liguria but, not faraway from Passo del Turchino, turns North and reaches Masone and Campo Ligure receiving from the right hand its main tributaries, Rio Vezzulla and Torrente Ponzema. Crossing Rossiglione the Stura divides the town in Rossiglione Superiore (Upper Rossigline) and Rossiglione Inferiore (Lower Rossiglione). A couple of kilometres downstream it enters Piedmont between Belforte Monferrato and Ovada. It joins the Orba near the northern border of Ovada, at around 170 m.a.s.l..|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we compare}} the {{performance}} of an hydrological model when driven by probabilistic rain forecast derived from two different post-processing techniques. The <b>region</b> <b>of</b> interest is <b>Piemonte,</b> northwestern Italy, a complex orography area close to the Mediterranean Sea where the forecast are often a challenge for weather models. The May 2008 flood is here used as a case study, and the very dense weather station network allows us for a very good description of the event and initialization of the hydrological model. The ensemble probabilistic forecasts of the rainfall fields are obtained with the Bayesian model averaging, with the classical poor man ensemble approach and with a new technique, the Multimodel SuperEnsemble Dressing. In this case study, the meteo-hydrological chain initialized with the Multimodel SuperEnsemble Dressing is able to provide more valuable discharge ranges {{with respect to the}} one initialized with Bayesian model averaging multi-model...|$|R
