25|$|SLiM {{functions}} {{in almost every}} pathway due to their critical role in <b>regulatory</b> <b>function,</b> protein-protein interaction and signal transduction. SLiM act as interaction modules that are recognised by additional biomolecules. The majority of known interaction partners of SLiMs are globular protein domains, though, SLiMs that recognise other intrinsically disordered regions, RNA and lipids have also been characterised. SLiMs can be broadly split into two high level classes, modification sites and ligand binding sites.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1991, the {{electricity}} sector in Argentina was vertically integrated. The sector experienced a serious {{crisis in the}} summers of 1988/1989, primarily {{due to the lack}} of maintenance of the country's thermal power plants (50% were unavailable). Shortly after the crisis, the government of Carlos Menem introduced a new legal framework for {{the electricity}} sector through Law 24,065, which included the following elements: vertical and horizontal unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution; opening up of all segments to the private sector; and separation of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>function</b> from policy setting. As a result of the new law, there was substantial private investment which, together with the public power plants that started production in the 1990s, transformed a situation of power shortage and low quality into one of abundance and reliability at lower prices.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} {{architecture of}} ABC transporters consists minimally of two TMDs and two NBDs. Four individual polypeptide chains including two TMD and two NBD subunits, may combine {{to form a}} full transporter {{such as in the}} E. coli BtuCD importer involved in the uptake of vitamin B12. Most exporters, such as in the multidrug exporter Sav1866 from Staphylococcus aureus, are made up of a homodimer consisting of two half transporters or monomers of a TMD fused to a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). A full transporter is often required to gain functionality. Some ABC transporters have additional elements that contribute to the <b>regulatory</b> <b>function</b> of this class of proteins. In particular, importers have a high-affinity binding protein (BP) that specifically associates with the substrate in the periplasm for delivery to the appropriate ABC transporter. Exporters do not have the binding protein but have an intracellular domain (ICD) that joins the membrane-spanning helices and the ABC domain. The ICD is believed to be responsible for communication between the TMD and NBD.|$|E

[...] Once cytochrome c is released it binds with Apoptotic protease activating factor – 1 (Apaf-1) and ATP, which then bind to pro-caspase-9 to create a protein complex known as an apoptosome. [...] The apoptosome cleaves the pro-caspase to its active form of caspase-9, which in turn activates the effector caspase-3.|$|E
2500|$|The helical F-actin {{filament}} {{found in}} muscles {{also contains a}} tropomyosin molecule, a 40-nanometre protein that is wrapped around the F-actin helix.

[...] There are other protein molecules bound to the tropomyosin thread, these include the troponins that have three polymers: troponin I, troponin T, and troponin C.

2500|$|Due to {{the impact}} of the 1997 East Asian {{financial}} crisis the contracts were renegotiated through a [...] "Restated Cooperative Agreement" [...] signed in October 2001. The agreement also foresaw the creation of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body (JWSRB) as an [...] "independent" [...] regulator in charge of supervising the concessions and reviewing requests for tariff increases on behalf of the Governor of Jakarta and the Ministry of Public Works. Initially, PAM Jaya had the responsibility to monitor the performance of the two private companies on behalf of the city government in addition to being an asset holding company. By creating the regulatory body the <b>regulatory</b> <b>function</b> was to be clearly separated from the asset holding function, thus avoiding a possible perception of a conflict of interest. In April 2001 the City Council approved a tariff increase of 35 percent, while leaving tariffs in the two poorest consumer categories unchanged. After the signing of the new contract, lengthy negotiations began with the assistance of external advisors brought in {{with the support of the}} Asian Development Bank about the so-called [...] "rate rebasing" [...] for the period 2002-2007. During the negotiations, two other tariff increases were approved in April 2003 and January 2004, again leaving tariffs for the poorest unchanged.
