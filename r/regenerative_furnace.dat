5000|$|In 1865, the French {{engineer}} Pierre-Émile Martin {{took out}} a license from Siemens and first applied his <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace</b> for making steel. The most appealing characteristic of the Siemens <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace</b> is the rapid production of large quantities of basic steel, used for example to construct high-rise buildings. The usual size of furnaces is 50 to 100 tons, but for some special processes {{they may have a}} capacity of 250 or even 500 tons.|$|E
50|$|Later {{applications}} {{included the}} blast furnace {{process known as}} hot blast and the Open hearth furnace also called Siemens <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace</b> (which was used for making glass), where the hot exhaust gases from combustion are passed through firebrick regenerative chambers, which are thus heated. The flow is then reversed, so that the heated bricks preheat the fuel.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Regenerative</b> rotary {{reheating}} <b>furnace</b> is a {{new type}} furnace in metallurgy industry. It can reduce cost and it is low contamination exhaust. But {{it is hard for}} the temperature setting because it has complicated field and especial configuration. This paper focuses on the <b>regenerative</b> rotary <b>furnace,</b> develops mathematics models and regional discrete method for temperature setting. This paper produces a good example for subsequent research and development of <b>regenerative</b> rotary <b>furnace...</b>|$|R
50|$|Recuperators {{have also}} been used to recover heat from waste gasses to preheat {{combustion}} air and fuel for many years by metallic recuperators to reduce energy costs and carbon footprint of operation. Compared to alternatives such as <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnaces,</b> initial costs are lesser, there are no valves to be switching back and forth, there are no induced-draft fans {{and it does not}} require a web of gas ducts spread up all over the furnace.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of nitrogen oxide (NOx) formation in combustion chambers of glass furnaces is briefly described. The most important parameters governing the NOx emissions of glass furnaces are discussed. Elimination or minimisation of conditions {{that cause the}} formation of nitrogen oxides in <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnaces</b> have been tested in industrial <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnaces.</b> They include: reduction of false air, low air excess in the combustion process, delayed mixing or stepwise mixing of fuel with (preheated) air and enhanced flame cooling by promoting soot formation. Results of the industrial tests are presented as well as data from literature. Primary measures for minimising NOx formation in combustion chambers of glass furnaces show their limitations with respect to glass quality (fining, early sulphate decomposition), refractory attack by reducing flue gases and deposition of more aggressive condensation products in the regenerator and beyond a certain point, other emissions (particulate, SO 2, CO) may increase on further reductions in NOx emissions. The potential of primary measures in reducing NOx emissions from glass furnaces is still not known, since some possibilities have not been completely investigated, such as major combustion and burner port design changes and flameless oxidation combustion. In this paper results of such primary measures to achieve NOx emission reduction are reviewed and new observations are reported...|$|R
5000|$|Open {{hearth furnace}} was first {{developed}} by German-born engineer Carl Wilhelm Siemens. In 1865, the French engineer Pierre-Émile Martin {{took out a}} license from Siemens and first applied his <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace</b> for making steel. Their process {{was known as the}} Siemens-Martin process, and the furnace as an [...] "open-hearth" [...] furnace. Most open hearth furnaces were closed by the early 1990s, not least because of their slow operation, being replaced by the basic oxygen furnace or electric arc furnace.|$|E
50|$|The {{next great}} advance in steel making was the Siemens-Martin process. Sir Charles William Siemens {{developed}} his <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace</b> in the 1850s, {{for which he}} claimed in 1857 to able to recover enough heat to save 70-80% of the fuel. The furnace operated at a high temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it in that manner.|$|E

This furnace operates {{at a high}} temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it for that.|$|E
5000|$|Retorts are {{operated}} in sets {{and have a}} heat carrier preparation unit and rotating water seals designed for the whole set instead of a single retort as in case of the Kiviter retort. <b>Regenerative</b> <b>furnaces</b> are located next to the retorts and they are operating in two cycles - the combustion cycle and the gas heating cycle. During the combustion cycle, a furnace is heated up to [...] by combustion gases. After the combustion cycle, retort gases from the condensation system is inserted into a furnace for their heating. [...] By alternating furnaces, one furnace is always available for heating retort gas. Twenty retorts typically share one condensation system {{and a set of}} heating furnaces.|$|R
40|$|Packed bed {{is widely}} used for {{different}} industries and technologies, such as heat exchangers, heat recovery, thermal energy storage and chemical reactors. In modern steel industry, packed bed regenerator is widely utilized in the reheating furnace to increase the furnace efficiency. This study established a two dimensional numerical model to simulate a packed bed used in <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnaces.</b> The physical properties of fluids and packed stuffing (such as density, thermal conductivity, and specific heat) are considered as functions of temperature to adapt the large temperature variation in operation. The transient temperature profiles of the flue gas, packed bed, and air during the heating and regeneration period are examined for various switching time (30, 60, 120, and 240 s). The results reveal that, during the heating period, the spanwise averaged heat transfer coefficient is decreased along the longitudinal downstream direction, while during the regeneration period, the opposite trend is true. Moreover, the regenerator thermal effectiveness is decreased by increasing the switching time...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{thermal value}} theory, {{the aim of}} this paper is to deduce the {{theoretical}} formulas for evaluating the energy ef-fective utilization degree in technological pyrological processes exemplified by metallurgical heating furnaces. Heat transfer models for continuous heating furnaces, batch-type heating <b>furnaces,</b> and <b>regenerative</b> heating <b>furnaces</b> are es-tablished, respectively. By analyzing the movement path of injected infinitesimal heat attached on steel or gas, thermal value equations of continuous, batch-type, and <b>regenerative</b> heating <b>furnaces</b> are derived. Then the influences of such factors as hot charging, gas preheating and intake time of heat on energy effective utilization degree are discussed by thermal value equations. The results show that thermal value rises with hot charging and air preheating for continuous heating furnaces, with shorter intake time when heat is attached on steel or longer intake time when heat is attached on gas for batch-type heating furnaces and that with more heat supply at early heating stage or less at late stage for regen-erative heating furnaces...|$|R
50|$|On 1 October 1858, the German firm Siemens & Halske {{established}} an English firm, Siemens & Halske & Company, a partnership of William Siemens, cable manufacturer R S Newall of Gateshead and Siemens & Halske of Berlin. Its {{purpose was to}} help lay Newall's newly developed submarine communications cable. The London branch was {{under the control of}} William, later Sir William Siemens, formerly known as Carl Wilhelm Siemens (1823-1883). Hanover-born Sir William went to England in 1843 to sell a patent he shared with his brother Werner. He found employment in Birmingham with engineers Fox, Henderson & Co and became a naturalised British subject in 1859, the same day as he married the daughter of an Edinburgh lawyer. Her brother was Lewis Gordon business partner of R S Newall. During the 1850s Sir William developed the Siemens <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace</b> is the {{greatest}} single invention of Charles William Siemens, using {{a process known as}} the Siemens-Martin process. The electric pyrometer, which is perhaps the most elegant and original of all William Siemens's inventions, is also the link which connects his electrical with his metallurgical researches. Siemens pursued two major themes in his inventive efforts, one based upon the science of heat, the other based upon the science of electricity; and the electric thermometer was, as it were, a delicate cross-coupling which connected both. Imbued with the idea of regeneration, and seeking in nature for that thrift of power which he, as an inventor, had always aimed at, Siemens suggested a hypothesis on which the sun conserves its heat by a circulation of its fuel in space, afterwards reprinting the controversy in a volume, On the Conservation of Solar Energy.|$|E
50|$|Ahlström officially {{divided the}} {{production}} of Karhula-Iittala products in 1937. Iittala glassworks would concentrate on hand-blown glass while Karhula glassworks would take over all automated glass production. The plans which had been around as early as 1933 were delayed because of WW2, though working methods and furnaces’ were modernized anyways in 1937. Some of the changes at the Iittala glassworks included the conversion of a single special crucible furnace and the old 4 crucible furnace into 6 crucibles. An 8 crucible <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace</b> was also built but the substantially increased output did not {{change the fact that}} all exported Iittala products were still sold under the Karhula brand and within Finland Iittala products were still sold under Karhula-Iittala. After the taking over of the Viiala glassworks by Karhula Oy and Riihimäen Lasi Oy a separate furnace for blowing electric lamps was built, since the employees, {{as part of the deal}} went to the Iittala glassworks.|$|E
50|$|Since 1989, Firozabad has {{produced}} artistic glassware in different colours and shades used in chandeliers and other items. About four hundred glass industries are registered in Firozabad, making {{different types of}} glass products. They use natural gas instead of coal. Half of the production of these units is exported. Nowadays, blowing/modeling {{is done by the}} Pot <b>Furnace</b> and <b>Regenerative</b> tank <b>furnace</b> in the factories.|$|R
50|$|Cottrell’s {{longtime}} {{interest in}} nitrogen fixation prompted a collaboration with Farrington Daniels of the University of Wisconsin, beginning in 1939. Daniels and associates {{were trying to}} develop a thermal process for nitrogen fixation using a <b>regenerative</b> pebble-bed <b>furnace,</b> which they hoped would be an inexpensive alternative to the Haber ammonia synthesis. Although the project helped rejuvenate Cottrell emotionally, the development of the process was not complete until after Cottrell’s death.|$|R
50|$|Wellman {{began his}} career working at the Nashua Iron Company. He was {{encouraged}} by his father to build a <b>regenerative</b> gas <b>furnace</b> for the company. Wellman did this, impressing Carl Wilhelm Siemens, who immediately hired him to establish the first crucible-steel furnace in America. Wellman went on to improve upon the open-hearth process of steel rail production, which in turn had improved upon the Bessemer process. In 1869, Wellman built the first commercially successful open-hearth furnace in America at the Bay State Iron Works in South Boston.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Sir Charles William Siemens had {{developed}} his <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace</b> in the 1850s. His furnace operated {{at a high}} temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, and this process made cremation an efficient and practical proposal. Charles's nephew, Carl Friedrich von Siemens perfected {{the use of this}} furnace for the incineration of organic material at his factory in Dresden. The radical politician, Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, took the corpse of his dead wife there to be cremated in 1874. The efficient and cheap process brought about the quick and complete incineration of the body and was a fundamental technical breakthrough that finally made industrial cremation a practical possibility.|$|E
50|$|Siemens {{had been}} trained as a {{mechanical}} engineer, and his most important work {{at this early stage}} was non-electrical; the greatest achievement of his life, the <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace.</b> Though in 1847 he published a paper in Liebig's Annalen der Chemie on the 'Mercaptan of Selenium,' his mind was busy with the new ideas upon the nature of heat which were promulgated by Carnot, Clapeyron, Joule, Clausius, Mayer, Thomson, and Rankine. He discarded the older notions of heat as a substance, and accepted it as a form of energy. Working on this new line of thought, which gave him an advantage over other inventors of his time, he made his first attempt to economise heat, by constructing, in 1847, at the factory of John Hick, of Bolton, an engine of four horse-power, having a condenser provided with regenerators, and using superheated steam. Two years later he continued his experiments at the works of Messrs. Fox, Henderson, and Co., of Smethwick, near Birmingham, who had taken the matter in hand. The use of superheated steam was attended with many practical difficulties, and the invention was not entirely successful; nevertheless, the Society of Arts, in 1850, acknowledged the value of the principle, by awarding Siemens a gold medal for his regenerative condenser.|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} prediction {{of the performance of}} a glass furnace is described. It comprises sub-models for the combustion chamber, feed stock melting (batch), and the glass tank flow. The first sub-model which incorporates physical modelling for the lqted turbulent diffusionjames, soot formation and consumption, and the thermal radiation is given emphasis herein. The whole {{mathematical model}} is applied to an end-port <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace</b> for both gas and heavy oilfiring. ...|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} and experimental investigation results of heat transfer {{in the case}} of calcite calcinations in <b>regenerative</b> shaft <b>furnaces</b> are given in the paper. Influence of heating gas temperature, calcined material fragment size and desired final product output on the duration of calcite calcination has been studied. It has been shown that with the given percentage of final product output and permissible changes in heating gas temperature in the furnace it is the fraction size of the calcined material that greatly determines such parameter as a process duration...|$|R
40|$|Pyrolysis of {{municipal}} solid waste can {{take full advantage of}} energy and resource and avoid producing hazardous material during this period. In combination with mature metallurgical technologies of coking by coke oven, <b>regenerative</b> flame <b>furnace</b> technology and melting by electric arc <b>furnace,</b> technologies of <b>regenerative</b> fixed bed pyrolysis technology for household waste, co-coking technology for waste plastic and blend coal, and incineration ash melting technology by electric arc technology for medical waste were respectively developed to improve current unsatisfied sorting status of waste.

40|$|The flow {{characteristics}} of neutral sodium silicate glass {{in an open}} hearth <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace</b> have been studied using a one tenth scale physical model. The constraints of similarity have been investigated and discussed, {{and the use of}} sodium liquor as a cold modelling solution has been developed. Methylene Blue and Sulphacid Brill Pink are used as delineators, and a technique for analysing the concentration of each even in a mixture has been developed. The residence/time distributions from the model have been simulated using a mixed model computer program which identifies the nature and size of the most significant flow streams within the furnace. The results clearly show that the model gives a true representation of the furnace and illustrates a number of alternatives for operating or design changes which will lead to improved production efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this article, a new {{combustion}} control {{program would be}} introduced, which is planned to use fuzzy neural network for intelligent analysis of temperature variation on end fire glass furnace. This program would be adapted to regenerative end fire glass furnace. The actual running of system indicates {{that the system is}} in good effect and suitable for the production technology very well. Preface The melting of glass is a complex physical-chemistry reaction, which is full of not only delays and inertia, but also is nonlinear. Affected by different factors, such as gas pressure, batch uniformity and insulating of furnace etc, this reaction becomes a complex thermal process. Thus, it is difficult to set an accurate mathematical model to control this complex process. However, as an important procedure in this reaction, the commutation system for <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace</b> would not only affect the glass quality and the energy consumption but also concern about the environment protection and labor’s protection. Nowadays, the PID {{combustion control}} system is widely used in glass factory. This PID system could run very well in a small range around the working spot. However, when the melting process is in big undulation, the control effect becomes bad because of the delay and the changed parameters...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn 2001, in the ICG {{conference in}} Edinburgh, M. Cable [1] {{examined}} glass making progresses during the industrialization of the 19 th century. He observed that engineering and transport rapidly growing {{had a major}} influence on the scale of glass manufacture, increasing the ability to obtain fuel and raw materials and distributing products to the customers. Those factors largely contributed to the expansion of the glass industry but could not take place without improvements in technology. Among those new technologies, the Siemens <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace</b> was a crucial development in glass making because it raised maximum achievable temperatures and greatly improved thermal efficiency. In 1954, F. W. Hodkin made a controversial communication to the Yorkshire Section of the Society of Glass Technology about the Siemens-Tank Story [2] which shows that there was some misinterpretation of information from W. E. S. Turner. Following this, the latter clarified his views to Hodkin who was stimulated to "enquire further into the points he has raised. " The Siemens "principle", the use of gas producers coupled with a "regenerative furnace" dates back {{to the end of the}} 1850 's (British patent No. 1320 in 1861). It was applied first to metallurgical and very soon to glass furnaces [2]. The "tank furnace" was patented only in 1872 (British patent No. 3478). In his letter reported by Hodkin, Turner said that "there is no doubt that the ideas of the Siemens brothers were worked out to a practical stage in England before being applied elsewhere [ [...] . ] From about 1865 onwards Siemens's gas furnaces, which until then had only acquired a solid footing in England, began to appear on the continent". M. Cable [1] says that "in 1861 William having obtained a British patent was negotiating with Chance Brothers, who at first wanted an exclusive licence, which William would not grant, and dithered, even after accepting that decision. " Looking at a well documented internal report written by H. de Coqueréaumont around the end of the first World War about the development of the plate glass technology in the Compagnie de Saint Gobain, it appears that, while William Siemens was discussing with Chance Brothers, or very shortly afterwards, in 1862, he was also in contact with the Glacerie de Montluçon, not yet part of the Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, with the same aim, selling his invention,recently patented (May 1861 No 49068). During the same year in November 1862, contacts between W. Siemens and Saint-Gobain resulted in an agreement and in May 1863, the first Siemens <b>regenerative</b> <b>furnace</b> was alighted in the Saint Gobain glass factory. Besides dealing with the Siemens furnaces (regenerator and later, continuous tank furnace) developments in the Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, by analysis of the technical data contained in this unpublished report, the present paper relates a few aspects of the story of the relationship of Saint-Gobain and W. Siemens extracted from the correspondence between the two parties during those critical years, which is kept in the Archives of Saint-Gobain...|$|E
40|$|The {{character}} of the glass melt flow in a <b>regenerative</b> container <b>furnace</b> was simulated by mathematical modeling under conditions of various energy distributions in the melting space with the application of electric boosting. The aim was the achievement of high melting performance and the decrease of heat losses. The results of the modeling have confirmed that the melting performance generally increased and heat losses decreased {{with the growth of}} the total amount of energy added to the batch region of the furnace. The amount of energy delivered to the furnace batch region moved between 30 - 60 % of the total supplied energy; the melting performance then corresponded with 230 - 460 tons/day, and the specific heat losses were between 1450 - 2100 kJ/kg of glass. The energetic model of melt flows is presented providing the diagram of various flow characters...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to determine the feasibility of applying gas reburn to glass tanks for NOx emissions control. Three model furnaces representing the main furnace types were evaluated: a 250 ton per day end port container glass furnace, a 500 ton per day side port flat glass furnace, and a 125 ton per day recuperative fiber glass furnace. The evaluation consisted of conceptual reburn system designs, a thermal analysis, an estimate of NOx removal achievable, and an economic analysis. It was found that NOx reductions {{on the order of}} 80 percent may be expected for the <b>regenerative</b> glass <b>furnaces,</b> and 65 percent for the recuperated furnace. The cost of control is estimated to be 25 to 33 {{percent of the cost of}} oxy-fuel. Potential complications are an estimated increase on the order of 200 graden F in gas temperatures throughout the regenerator and a decrease in fuel efficiency of up to 10 to 12. 4 percent...|$|R
40|$|All {{over the}} world, {{there is an}} {{increasing}} drive to develop new technologies or concepts for industrial glass melting furnaces, with the main aim to increase the energy efficiency, tabilize production and reduce emissions. The application of new process sensors, improved furnace design, intelligent control strategy and waste gas heat recovery systems support the glass manufacturers to achieve ever increasing requirements concerning energy efficiency and emission limits. Glass industries are searching for breakthrough innovations (revolution), but introduction of such major changes in industry is hampered by large risks and investments. Therefore most companies prefer a stepwise improvement (evolution) based on existing concepts, such a <b>regenerative</b> glass <b>furnaces.</b> When different technologies are combined, it will even be possible, in specific cases, to avoid the use of flue gas scrubbers or DeNOx systems. An overview of requirements for industrial glass furnaces is given concerning melting characteristics and performance of the furnaces.

In this paper, {{an example of an}} optimized, regenerative end-port fired glass furnace concept, based on a combination of current (BAT) technologies, will be given in more detail. Basic innovative elements of such a furnace will be shown and its expected performance...|$|R

40|$|Glass {{was used}} since the Roman {{age in the}} {{building}} envelope, but it became widely applied together with iron since the 19 th century. Belgium was a major producer of window glass {{during the nineteenth century}} and the majority of the produced window glass was exported all over the world. Investigating the literature on the development of 19 th century Belgian window glass production is therefore internationally relevant. In the 17 th century, wood was replaced as a fuel by coal. In the 19 th century, the <b>regenerative</b> tank <b>furnace</b> applied gas as a fuel in a continuous glass production process. The advantages were a clean production, a more constant and higher temperature in the furnace and a fuel saving. The French chemist Nicolas Leblanc (1787 - 1793) and later the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay (1863) invented processes to produce alkali out of common salt. The artificial soda ash improved the quality and aesthetics of the glass plates. During the 19 th century, the glass production was industrialized, influencing the operation of furnaces, the improvement of raw materials as well as the applied energy sources. Although the production process was industrialized, glassblowing was still the work of an individual. By improving his work tools, he was able to create larger glass plates. The developments in the annealing process followed this evolution. The industry had to wait until the invention of the drawn glass {{in the beginning of the}} 20 th century to fully industrialise the window glass manufacture process...|$|R

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} {{can be used}} as a useful design tool for studying new furnace configurations with different operating conditions. However, this potential cannot be realized until the numerical models that are used in the simulations are fully validated against experimental results. In the present work, the combustion process in an experimental <b>regenerative,</b> slab reheat <b>furnace</b> was simulated in order to validate several numerical models in the FLUENT code. A total of 14 cases employing different numerical models were simulated with a uniform fuel distribution. Out of the 14 cases, only 11 obtained a converged solution. The results from these 11 cases were compared against experimental measurements in terms of the energy input and output rates and the temperature distribution in the center of the slab. The three best cases in terms of both accuracy and computational effort were cases that employed the k-epsilon turbulence model, the Delta Thesis, and a constant absorption coefficient. These three cases were simulated again using a second set of operating conditions in order to evaluate their performance in the case of a non-uniform fuel distribution. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Recent {{advances}} on High Temperature Air Combustion (HiTAC) are reviewed. In HiTAC method, combined {{heat regeneration}} and low oxygen methods are utilized to enlarge {{and control the}} flame thermal behavior. The HiTAC technology emerged from the conception of Excess Enthalpy Combustion (EEC). This technology {{has the potential for}} very wide applications, including power and process industries and energy conversion. The technology has been shown to provide significant reduction in energy consumption (up to 60 %), downsizing of the equipment (about 30 %) and lower emissions (about 30 %) while maintaining high thermal performance of the system. Energy savings translate to reduction of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases to the environment. Qualitative and quantitative results are presented on several gaseous diffusion flames using high temperature combustion air. A specially designed <b>regenerative</b> combustion test <b>furnace</b> facility, built by Nippon Furnace Kogyo, Japan, was used to preheat the combustion air to high temperatures. The flames with highly preheated combustion air were much more stable and homogeneous (both temporally and spatially) as compared to the room-temperature combustion air. Information on global flame features, flame spectral emission characteristics, spatial distribution of OH, CH and C 2 species and emission of pollutants has been obtained. The global flame feature showed range of flame colors (yellow, blue, bluish-green, green and purple) over the range of conditions examined. In some cases hybrid color flame was also observed. Under certain conditions flameless or colorless oxidation of the fuel has also been observed. Low levels of NOx along with negligible amounts of CO and HC have been obtained under high-temperature air combustion conditions. The thermal and chemical behavior of high-temperature air combustion flames depends on fuel property, preheat temperature and oxygen concentration of air. Flames with high temperature air provide much higher heat flux than normal air. Challenges of this new technology are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Since present {{conventional}} {{glass melting}} furnaces have reached their technological limits {{both in terms}} of energy usage and emission, a number of add-on systems have been developed for <b>regenerative</b> and recuperative <b>furnaces</b> in recent years to minimize NO_x emissions and the energy consumption of these conventional furnaces by means of already known primary and secondary measures, the modification of these measures and their combination. The individual components of a glass melting furnace have been designed, coordinated, optimized and developed further for this R and D project in order to develop one of the largest melting furnaces for container glass and to install a trend-setting prototypical full scale unit for the first time which now represents the third generation of a well-known and proven glass melting furnace type. Since glass melting furnaces are a very complex system, many of their parameters cannot be simply applied from one scale to the next so that certain specific tasks had to be redefined, resimulated, retraced and resolved by means of physical model tests and corresponding mathematical computer calculations in order to achieve the aim of this R and D project and to reduce the economic risks with the implementation of the development results. The primary environmental technology involved in the standard LoNOx"c"i"r"c"l"e"d"R Melter does not require any external add-on systems and so the furnace compaign can be extended and savings are achieved in both material and labour costs which will finally result in a lower final unit cost of glass produced. The consequent accomplishment of the primary measures of the LoNOx "t"r"a"d"e"m"a"r"k Melter proved that this full scale unit is consistently capable of achieving specific emission levels of 500 mg NO_x/Nm" 3 dry waste gas, converted to 8 % oxygen, a value subjected to the dynamic clause.
