5|$|Some of the tele{{recorded}} Pertwee episodes also {{survive on}} NTSC colour videotapes, recorded over-air on consumer hardware. In the early 1990s, an early {{form of the}} Doctor Who Restoration Team attempted to pair the low-resolution colour signal from these sources with the high-resolution black-and-white signal from the black-and-white film recordings. In this way, several Jon Pertwee stories were <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rough form of colour: Doctor Who and the Silurians, Terror of the Autons, and The Dæmons. Off-air NTSC colour tapes were also recovered for all of The Ambassadors of Death, but were considered of too poor a quality to permit more than a partial restoration.|$|E

5|$|Unluckily for Galland, his {{excellence}} at evaluation {{earned him}} a place at Tutow training facility where {{he was asked to}} test fly prototype reconnaissance and strike aircraft.

During his time there, he gave positive evaluations on types such as the Focke-Wulf Fw 189 and Henschel Hs 129. During his test piloting career at Tutow, Galland received unwelcome news; he was to become Gruppenkommandeur of II.(Schlacht)/Lehrgeschwader 2 (II.(S)/LG 2—2nd battle group of the 2nd Demonstration Wing). It was not a fighter unit, but a special mixed Geschwader of ground attack aircraft.|$|E

5|$|While {{patterns}} {{can provide}} more effective crypsis than solid colour when the camouflaged object is stationary, any pattern, particularly one with high contrast, stands {{out when the}} object is moving. Jungle camouflage uniforms were issued during the Second World War, but both the British and American forces found that a simple green uniform provided better camouflage when soldiers were moving. After the war, most nations <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> unicoloured uniform for their troops. Some nations, notably Austria and Israel, continue to use solid colour combat uniforms today. Similarly, while larger military aircraft traditionally had a disruptive pattern with a darker top over a lighter lower surface (a form of countershading), modern fast fighter aircraft often wear gray overall.|$|E
5|$|With Sweet Emma, Dear Böbe (1992), Szabó <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{strictly}} Hungarian subject—this time, however, {{focused on}} a contemporary, rather than historical, social problem.
