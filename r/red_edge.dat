In 1916, the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway criticised the illustration for differing from Du Tertre's description; Du Tertre supposedly only meant that the proximal primary feathers were yellow, whereas all the covert feathers are yellow in the illustration, apart from a <b>red</b> <b>edge,</b> and the head and underparts are slate.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{was about}} 18 {{years old when}} he was in a band called <b>Red</b> <b>Edge</b> with his brother and some friends, but the band needed a singer. Jones put an {{advertisement}} in the local Brisbane music paper, Time Off, looking for a suitable singer. Darren Hayes responded to the ad and became their singer. Hayes got tired of performing other people's songs and he was ready to quit <b>Red</b> <b>Edge,</b> whereas Jones wanted to create his own music. Both decided to leave the band, and began to pursue a career together, marking the beginning of Savage Garden.|$|E
25|$|Suppose {{that we have}} an edge {{colouring}} of {{a complete}} graph using 3 colours, red, green and blue. Suppose further that the edge colouring has no monochromatic triangles. Select a vertex v. Consider the set of vertices that have a <b>red</b> <b>edge</b> to the vertex v. This is called the red neighbourhood of v. The red neighbourhood of v cannot contain any red edges, since otherwise there would be a red triangle consisting of the two endpoints of that <b>red</b> <b>edge</b> and the vertex v. Thus, the induced edge colouring on the red neighbourhood of v has edges coloured with only two colours, namely green and blue. Since R(3, 3) = 6, the red neighbourhood of v can contain at most 5 vertices. Similarly, the green and blue neighbourhoods of v can contain at most 5 vertices each. Since every vertex, except for v itself, is in one of the red, green or blue neighbourhoods of v, the entire complete graph can have at most 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 16 vertices. Thus, we have R(3, 3, 3) ≤ 17.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Hayes {{answered}} {{an advertisement}} in a magazine, placed by Daniel Jones, for a lead vocalist {{position in the}} band called <b>Red</b> <b>Edge.</b> Hayes was successful, despite his voice breaking in the audition, as he mentioned {{in an interview with}} Rosie O'Donnell. The cover band broke up in 1994 and Hayes formed a partnership with Jones, a duo band initially to be called Crush. However, there already existed another band in the UK that owned the rights to the name. Hayes and Jones submitted their first demo tape to record companies under the name Bliss, before they eventually changed their name to Savage Garden, a phrase used by Anne Rice to describe the world through the eyes of Lestat in her novel The Vampire Lestat. The Savage Garden is a vision of Earth in which the natural laws of the world govern over anything aesthetic or civil.|$|E
25|$|Skin lesions of Lyme-like disease. Early {{symptoms}} {{in the first}} four weeks after a tickbite include a rash or red patch that gradually expands over several days. It may get quite large (up to 50mm or more in diameter). This rash is called erythema migrans or EM. It can be difficult to distinguish from an allergic reaction {{at the site of the}} bite. Allergic rashes usually occur within 48 hours of the bite, then fade. EM usually first appears after a delay of 48 hours following the tickbite and gets bigger over a few days or weeks. As it expands, EM rash often has a 'target' or 'bullseye' appearance, clearing in the middle with a more obvious <b>red</b> <b>edge.</b> EM can persist for months or years, coming and going in that time. Sometimes many small EM rashes occur. EM may only occur in as few as 20% of persons with Lyme disease.|$|E
500|$|In January 1925, {{notification}} that <b>red</b> <b>edge</b> lights {{had been}} installed along the runways and taxiways at Lympne was made. In July 1925, a new arrangement was introduced whereby aircraft not fitted with radio, flying across the Channel, could have their departure and arrival reported by radio to the authorities. A circuit of Lympne and St Inglevert {{had to be}} flown at a height not exceeding [...] on departure for, and arrival from, the continent. Between 1–3 August, the Royal Aeronautical Society held a meeting at Lympne. The Grosvenor Challenge Cup, Private Owners' Cup, Light Aeroplane Holiday Handicap and International Handicap were all competed for. Separate Speed Races were held for single and two-seater aircraft. In August 1925, the scheme for non-radio aircraft was extended to cover Ostend. One hour was allowed for the crossing to St Inglevert and two hours for the crossing to Ostend, after which the aircraft would be reported as missing. On 25 September, Lympne {{was one of a}} number of airfields which began operating a radio direction finding service. As before the 900-metre wavelength was used.|$|E

60|$|Then I went {{forth with}} a full heart. The night was very still, and none were {{stirring}} in the temple courts. I hurried through them, and reached {{the entrance to the}} pylon that is at the outer gate. Then, seeking solitude, and, as it were, to draw near to heaven, I climbed the pylon's two hundred steps, until at length I reached the massive roof. Here I leaned my breast against the parapet, and looked forth. As I looked, the <b>red</b> <b>edge</b> of the full moon floated up over the Arabian hills, and her rays fell upon the pylon where I stood and the temple walls beyond, lighting the visages of the carven Gods. Then the cold light struck the stretch of well-tilled lands, now whitening to the harvest, and as the heavenly lamp of Isis passed up to the sky, her rays crept slowly down to the valley, where Sihor, father of the land of Khem, rolls on toward the sea.|$|E

Also, I see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants. Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!" ...|$|E

60|$|As {{he did so}} {{it seemed}} as if the night were their only guest, and had been waiting on the {{threshold}} to now enter bodily and pervade all things with its presence. With that cool, fragrant inflow of air they breathed freely. The <b>red</b> <b>edge</b> had gone from Black Spur, but it was even more clearly defined against the sky in its towering blackness. The sky itself had grown lighter, although the stars still seemed mere reflections of the solitary pin-points of light scattered along the concave valley below. Mingling with the cooler, restful air of the summit, yet penetratingly distinct from it, arose the stimulating breath of the pines below, still hot and panting from the day-long sun. The silence was intense. The far-off barking of a dog on the invisible river-bar nearly a mile beneath them came to them like a sound in a dream. They had risen, and, standing in the doorway, by common consent turned their faces to the east. It was the frequent attitude of the home-remembering miner, and it gave him the crowning glory of the view. For, beyond the pine-hearsed summits, rarely seen except against the evening sky, lay a thin, white cloud like a dropped portion of the Milky Way. Faint with an indescribable pallor, remote yet distinct enough to assert itself above and beyond all surrounding objects, it was always there. It was the snow-line of the Sierras.|$|E
