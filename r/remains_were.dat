5|$|On 19 June 1250, {{following}} the canonisation of Malcolm's wife Margaret by Pope Innocent IV, Margaret's <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> disinterred {{and placed in}} a reliquary. Tradition has it that as the reliquary was carried to the high altar of Dunfermline Abbey, past Malcolm's grave, it became too heavy to move. As a result, Malcolm's <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> also disinterred, and buried next to Margaret beside the altar.|$|E

5000|$|Here are the {{statements}} of Starrs and his colleagues on this subject, quoted verbatim from their report (page 175): [...] "[...] [...] We are left with three possibilities: (1) the exhumed <b>remains</b> <b>are</b> indeed those of Jesse James; (2) the exhumed <b>remains</b> <b>are</b> not Jesse James, but from another maternal relative of RJ and MN; or (3) the exhumed <b>remains</b> <b>are</b> from an unrelated individual who, by chance, happens {{to have the same}} mtDNA sequence as RJ and MN [...] [...] [...] Do the mtDNA results prove that the exhumed <b>remains</b> <b>are</b> those of Jesse James? The answer to this question must be no, as there is always the possibility (however remote) that the <b>remains</b> <b>are</b> from a different maternal relative of RJ and MN, or from an unrelated person with the same mtDNA sequence. However, it should be emphasized that the mtDNA results are in complete agreement with the other scientific investigations of the exhumed remains: there is no scientific basis whatsoever for doubting that the exhumed <b>remains</b> <b>are</b> those of Jesse James. The burden of proof now shifts to those who, for whatever reason, choose to still doubt the identification [...] [...] [...]" ...|$|R
5|$|The <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> {{conclusively}} {{identified as}} Bormann's in 1998 when German authorities ordered genetic testing on {{fragments of the}} skull. The testing was led by Wolfgang Eisenmenger, Professor of Forensic Science at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Tests using DNA {{from one of his}} relatives identified the skull as that of Bormann. Bormann's <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> cremated and the ashes were scattered in the Baltic Sea on 16 August 1999.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler was a German {{politician}} {{who was the}} leader of the Nazi Party, Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer ("Leader") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. He killed himself by gunshot on 30 April 1945 in his Führerbunker in Berlin. Eva Braun, his wife of one day, committed suicide with him by taking cyanide. In accordance with Hitler's prior instructions, that afternoon their <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> carried up the stairs through the bunker's emergency exit, doused in petrol, and set alight in the Reich Chancellery garden outside the bunker. Records in the Soviet archives show that their burnt <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> recovered and interred in successive locations until 1970, when they were again exhumed, cremated, and the ashes scattered.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, Richard's corpse {{was taken}} to Leicester and buried without pomp. His {{original}} tomb monument {{is believed to have}} been removed during the English Reformation, and his <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> lost for more than five centuries, believed to have been thrown into the River Soar. In 2012, an archaeological excavation was commissioned by the Richard III Society on a city council car park on the site once occupied by Greyfriars Priory Church. The University of Leicester identified the skeleton found in the excavation as that of Richard III as a result of radiocarbon dating, comparison with contemporary reports of his appearance, and comparison of his mitochondrial DNA with that of two matrilineal descendants of Richard III's eldest sister, Anne of York. Richard's <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> reburied in Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015.|$|E

5|$|Bregowine died in 764 and was {{originally}} {{buried in the}} baptistry in Canterbury, but his <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> moved to the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in 1123. This followed an attempt in around 1121 to remove his remains to another monastery, which came to nothing. The <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> placed by the altar of St Gregory in the south transept, after having been briefly placed in the north transept. Bregowine was later considered a saint, with a feast day of 26August, although Florence of Worcester, a 12th-century writer, recorded his death date as 24August. Other sources record the death date as 25August. His life was later written by Eadmer in the 12thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Burial 67 {{was found}} in a cist under the second of five stucco floor levels in Northeast Plaza Structure 2. The {{skeleton}} was lying on its back with the head towards the north. The <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> poorly preserved but belonged to an adult. Of the skull only some dental <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> found. A ceramic plate had been placed under the head of the deceased and another plate was placed upon the knees. The plate was painted with four seated anthropomorphic figures with inclined head and wearing leather gloves with jaguar claws. The facial features of the figures are unusual. The bottom of the plate bears the image of a dancer. The ceramics date the burial to the Late Classic.|$|E

A piece of the upper jaw indicated that the <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> those of a child aged between 5 and 10 years old. Four ceramic pieces were deposited as an offering; two plates, an earthenware bowl and a bowl. Burial 68 is dated to the Late Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|Conwell died on April 22, 1842, {{at about}} the age of 94. Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia.

After the threat of excommunication, they withdrew their claim. Conwell's <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> buried in St. Mary's churchyard.
