5|$|Robin {{becomes a}} roommate to Katherine, {{who is still}} feeling {{depressed}} after her recent stint in a mental hospital. Robin encourages Katherine {{to go out to}} a bar, and the two have a great time. When two men hit on Robin and show no interest in Katherine, Robin shows them up by kissing Katherine on the lips. Katherine initially laughs at the funny moment, but later learns Robin <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lesbian. Katherine insists she is not interested in women when Robin suggests she explores the possibility, but later it appears that Katherine may be intrigued by the idea.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{manages to}} contact UNIT to {{coordinate}} efforts {{of how to}} return the other passengers safely to Earth. The Doctor and Christina scout ahead, while the others attempt to repair the bus. The Doctor and Christina spot a sandstorm on the horizon when they are met by two Tritovores, a species resembling anthropomorphic flies, who take them to their wrecked spaceship. They explain they were delivering a shipment to San Helios, which had housed over hundred billion just recently but now is desert wherever they scan. The Doctor has them scan the approaching sandstorm and finds it <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> swarm of stingray-like aliens that are destroying the ecosystem. He suspects they are generating the wormhole to travel to their next planet to feed upon, and they must hurry and close the wormhole before they can reach Earth. Christina uses her burglary skills to obtain a power crystal and its mounting from the Tritovore ship, but accidentally wakes an alien stingray, which consumes the Tritovores.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises {{coming from the}} attic. Homer claims not {{to know what they}} are talking about, even though he is seen heading into the attic with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} there <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the attic, where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the attic.|$|E

5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E
25|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} one of the {{developmental}} hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she <b>really</b> <b>is.</b> <b>A</b> baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears as if by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.|$|E
25|$|In the {{trenches}} of World War One, Johnson's name {{was used by}} British troops to describe the impact of German 150mm heavy artillery shells which had a black colour. In his letters home to his wife, Rupert Edward Inglis (1863–1916), a former rugby international who was a Forces Chaplain, describes passing through the town of Albert: We went through the place today (2 October 1915) where the Virgin Statue {{at the top of}} the Church was hit by a shell in January. The statue was knocked over, but has never fallen, I sent you a picture of it. It <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> wonderful sight. It is incomprehensible how it can have stayed there, but I think it is now lower than when the photograph was taken, and no doubt will come down with the next gale. The Church and village are wrecked, there’s a huge hole made by a Jack Johnson just outside the west door of the Church.|$|E

500|$|Autocar's Andrew Frankel was {{the first}} {{journalist}} to road-test the car and reported: [...] "Savage acceleration <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> given here. What's really incredible about the XJ220 {{is its ability to}} provide such performance in a way that never, ever intimidates." [...] He was particularly impressed with the throttle response, the driver's ability to control the performance of the car very precisely, {{and the way in which}} the engine delivers its power progressively rather than in one short burst.|$|E
500|$|What makes [...] "Ray Of Light" [...] one of Madonna's best singles is {{the fact}} that it is such a bitch to sing. Filled with {{multiple}} octave changes, it forced Madonna to push her vocal as far as it could possibly go. The song demanded she make use of her upper register and hold notes longer than she ever had before. It <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> techno gem that is always a standout at her concerts. After hearing a sample of it for the first time in the spring of 1998, I just knew that Madonna had outdone herself. The song brings the entire album of to a whole new level.|$|E
500|$|Bradman's game evolved with experience. He {{temporarily}} adapted {{his technique}} during the Bodyline series, deliberately {{moving around the}} crease {{in an attempt to}} score from the short-pitched deliveries. At his peak, in the mid-1930s, he had the ability to switch between a defensive and attacking approach as the occasion demanded. After the Second World War, he adjusted to bat within the limitations set by his age, becoming a steady [...] "accumulator" [...] of runs. However, Bradman never truly mastered batting on sticky wickets. Wisden commented, [...] "f there <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> blemish on his amazing record it is... the absence of a significant innings on one of those 'sticky dogs' of old".|$|E

[...] Bieber explained on his Twitter that [...] his fans [...] "took him from a small town in Canada" [...] to the [...] "amazing opportunity" [...] he is living now, and feels [...] "grateful for everything" [...] and [...] "blessed" [...] for the support. Bieber confirmed he co-wrote the track with August Rigo. He also told his fans to enjoy it as they are the ones who give him his strength in this.|$|E
500|$|Jay (Ed O'Neill) plans out {{a perfect}} Valentine's {{surprise}} for Gloria (Sofía Vergara). He hires a chef to prepare her a luxurious meal at their house, but must keep Gloria away while the chef is setting up. [...] Jay takes Gloria {{to a great}} restaurant that she loves, {{with the intent to}} leave after pretending to find that his secretary had forgotten to make a reservation. Unfortunately his plan goes awry; at the restaurant there <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reservation for two under the name Pritchett, so they have to stay much to Gloria's delight and Jay's flabbergasted anguish. Later, the reservation turns out to have been for Cameron and Mitchell, so that relieved and elated Jay and furious Gloria have to leave again.|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, wrote that the episode helps to {{illustrate}} the idea that [...] "evil [...] a mundane and human and somewhat pathetic thing", a concept that they note is rooted in many third season episodes of The X-Files. The two reasons that, despite Modell's ability, he is ultimately, [...] "something of a loser" [...] who wishes to [...] "be special" [...] rather than be cured of his brain disease. Furthermore, they argue that Modell's boasting of being a samurai [...] "is just a fantasy" [...] that he plays up; he <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> [...] "little man" [...] who yearns [...] "to be big".|$|E

500|$|Author of the 1985 book Fresh: Hip Hop Don't Stop, writer Nelson George further {{elaborated}} on {{the appeal}} of Radio to listeners at the time, describing LL Cool J as a [...] "minimalist homeboy who knows his beats", and stating [...] "You can call it rap, hip hop or street, but it <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> way of hearing music—and partying hard—that expresses the experiences and attitudes of a great many inner city kids. L.L. Cool J {{is one of the}} best young talkologists around, because he speaks directly to and about his generation over large beats that recall Run-D.M.C., Trouble Funk, James Brown, and funky little bits of AC/DC and Yes ... This teenage music is built around beats, but not just any old beats. It is all about a beat with style, with personality, and L.L. Cool J has plenty of both." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews were {{favorable}} upon release. IGN {{gave it a}} 10/10 score {{declaring that}} Lost [...] "delivers on every promise it makes to its audience." [...] In IGN's 2008 series of [...] "Flashback Reviews", IGN's Chris Carabott changed the scores; he gave part 1 a 9.5/10, saying that the show's mysteries [...] "would keep many of us captivated {{for the next four}} years"; he gave part 2 a 9/10, saying that [...] "It <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> roller coaster of emotion and that sense of dread that sets in here is brilliantly portrayed." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave an 'A', stating that even non-science fiction and fantasy fans can like it, and USA Today gave it 4 stars praising the cast. The Futon Critic later chose the pilot as the fifth best TV episode of 2004. TV Guide ranked the episode fifth on a list of the top 100 television episodes of all time.|$|E
500|$|Free Collars Kingdom {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from English-speaking audiences. Matthew Alexander of Mania praised the artwork, noting that characters were [...] "cute and sexy {{with a wide}} variety of clothing that does a good job expressing the character's personality" [...] and that, overall, the artwork was [...] "very clean with attractive characters and well-detailed backgrounds". In his review of the second volume, Alexander wrote that [...] "so far, the story continues to be a fun examination of what life might be like from the cat's point of view, but I don't know how the whole Wild Cat storyline is going to be wrapped up in only one more volume". In his review of the third volume, Alexander felt that [...] "the story probably received an early ending", but concluded that [...] "despite the series only being three volumes, it <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> worthy read and quite funny if you've ever owned a cat".|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} co-produced by Canadian electro-pop band Dragonette, with Martina Sorbara. Roberts stated that Dragonette {{were among the}} first people who worked on the record. Roberts {{discussed}} the 1940s influence on the record, noting [...] "When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reflection of that." [...] She stated that {{when it came to the}} production of the track she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point. The track was written in February 2010, and when asked about working with Dragonette on the track, Roberts responded, [...] "I was with them for quite a while writing, and they were the first people that I went in with when I started making the record. I learnt a lot from them. They're really lovely people, they work really hard, they're so talented." ...|$|E
500|$|Three {{songs were}} played during the ending credits {{which were not}} {{included}} on the V for Vendetta soundtrack. The first was [...] "Street Fighting Man" [...] by the Rolling Stones. The second was a special version of Ethan Stoller's [...] "BKAB". In keeping with revolutionary tone of the film, excerpts from [...] "On Black Power" [...] (also in [...] "A Declaration of Independence") by black nationalist leader Malcolm X, and from [...] "Address to the Women of America" [...] by feminist writer Gloria Steinem {{were added to the}} song. Gloria Steinem can be heard saying: [...] "This is no simple reform... It <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organising human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends." [...] The final song was [...] "Out of Sight" [...] by Spiritualized.|$|E
500|$|As part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch, The New 52, Barbara Gordon's {{paralysis}} {{is described}} as lasting only three years time. In Batgirl (volume 4), the character's age is reduced, and she is depicted as a recent college graduate, having {{earned a degree in}} forensic psychology. Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder, causing her to hesitate in battle when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage. The character also exhibits survivor guilt due to the fact she has made a full recovery from her paralysis while others have not. In a September 2011 interview, Gail Simone stated, [...] "I'm enjoying writing Batgirl at this stage in her life. She's younger, she doesn't know everything, she's been immersed in school and her life-plan. Events conspire to change that plan, and she's nervous about that. I love writing Barbara under pretty much any conditions, but this <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> key time for her." ...|$|E
