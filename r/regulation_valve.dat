40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} prediction of the unsteady flow field developing in a <b>regulation</b> <b>valve</b> for space thrusters. The flow field displays an unsteady behavior characterized by complex flow patterns, because such valves have a very narrow throat {{and because of the}} presence of geometrical slope discontinuities downstream the throat for design constraints. The narrowness of the throat induces strong flow accelerations and therefore strong temperature and pressure reductions. The geometrical discontinuities cause the occurrence of local flow separations and shock waves, with an high degree of unsteadiness. Experiments have pointed out how the degree of unsteadiness strongly depends upon the nature of the gas feeding the valve. The strongest unsteadiness has been observed in the case of xenon at low exit pressures. Numerical simulations, using a compressible Navier-Stokes flow solver, have been performed under different working conditions and for two different gases, nitrogen and xenon.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a coupling between the 1 D {{method of characteristics}} (MOC) and the 3 D finite volume method of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The coupling method is applied to compressible flow in hydraulic systems. The MOC code is implemented {{as a set of}} boundary conditions in the OpenFOAM open source CFD software. The coupling is realized by two linear equations originating from the characteristics equation and the Riemann constant equation, respectively. The coupling method is validated using three simple water hammer cases and several coupling configurations. The accuracy and robustness are investigated with respect to the mesh size ratio across the interface and to 3 D flow features close to the interface. The method is finally applied to the transient flow caused by the closing and opening of a knife valve (gate) in a pipe, where the flow is driven by the difference in free surface elevation between two tanks.

40|$|At present, {{regulation}} of water flow {{by means of}} pump frequency conversion {{is one of the}} major methods for power-saving in central air conditioning systems. In this article, optimization regulation for central air conditioning system on the basis of coordinative optimization control for variable chilled water temperature and variable chilled water flow to obtain better power savings is put forward. According to typical meteorological year data, hourly air conditioning load of whole year for every typical room has been calculated with the transmission function method. In order to guarantee each typical room, the highest cooling load rate is used as an input parameter for optimization calculation. Based on the surface cooler check model, the smallest energy consumption of chiller and chiller water pump was taken as the objective function of the optimization model. The performance characteristics of a chiller, water pump, <b>regulation</b> <b>valve</b> and pipeline are taken into account, and the optimization chilled water temperature and chilled water flow were carried out. The case study for a commercial building in Guangzhou showed that the annual power consumption of the chillers and pumps of the air conditioning system is lower by 17 % only with employment of variable water flow regulation by pump frequency conversion. In the case of optimization control with coordinative control of variable chilled water temperature and variable chilled water flow, the annual power consumption of the chillers and pumps of the air conditioning system is reduced by 22 % in presence of remarkable power saving effects. Increasing the chilled water temperature will reduce the dehumidified capability of the air cooler, and the indoor relative humidity will increase. The simulation showed that the adjustment optimized process meets the comfort of each typical room. The lower the cooling load rate is, the more obvious the effect of power-saving is.

The control of oil-furnace carbon black adsorption capacity is made with mass flow rate of hydrocarbon feedstock, {{which is the most}} important inlet process factor. Oil-furnace carbon black adsorption capacity in industrial process is determined with laboratory analyze of iodine adsorption number. It is shown continuously and automatically method for controlling iodine adsorption number in carbon black oil-furnaces to get as much as possible efficient control of adsorption capacity. In the proposed method it can be seen the correlation between qualitatively-quantitatively composition of the process tail gasses in the production of oil-furnace carbon black and relationship between air for combustion and hydrocarbon feedstock. It is shown that the ratio between air for combustion and hydrocarbon oil feedstock is depended of adsorption capacity summarized by iodine adsorption number, regarding to BMCI index of hydrocarbon oil feedstock. The mentioned correlation can be seen through the figures from 1. to 4. From the whole composition of the process tail gasses the best correlation for continuously and automatically control of iodine adsorption number is show the volume fraction of methane. The volume fraction of methane in the process tail gasses is increased with the decreasing values of iodine adsorption number of the oil-furnace carbon black which can be seen through the Figs. 5. and 6.

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{numerical}} study of the water flow in a square channel, during the closure of a gate. The flow is driven by a difference in surface elevation between an upstream and a downstream water tank. The case resembles, for example, the flow in hydro power water ways during a sudden closure of a turbine unit, {{in which it is}} of interest to quantify the amplitude and frequency of the following pressure waves. This work is a continuation of the senior SVC project aiming at studying 1 D- 3 D coupling and system transients coupled to local flow unsteadiness. That project presented initial experimental and numerical studies under the same conditions as in the present work. The current objective is to address the numerical modeling of transients with special focus on detailed 3 D processes interacting with the flow in an essentially 1 D geometry. First the pressure oscillations observed during the easurement campaign when the gate is closed is analyzed. 3 D simulations are performed using a computational domain that includes the upper and lower tank and its free surfaces. A flow rate is specified both at the inlet and outlet of the system, and the free surfaces dictates the pressure level in the system. A lot of time was spent dealing with a flow <b>regulation</b> <b>valve</b> below the upper tank that generated a pressure loss in the system, which was unfortunately not taken notice of in the original experimental study. The flow is assumed to be incompressible, and the time dependent Navier Stokes equations are solved in the system. The closing gate is modelled by cutting up the computational mesh. The results show that both the flow and the pressure behave as in the experiment. The pressure levels are similar as those in the experiment, since the loss generated by the regulating valve is taken into account. The oscillations observed in the experiments are not present in the numerical results, and it is suggested that these fluctuations observed in the measurement campaign are indeed pressure transients occurring due to the water hammer effect. Secondly, the upper tank and the pipe are modelled using a compressible 1 D code based on the method of characteristics (MOC). A comparison with the experimental data shows that the correct unsteady behavior of the system is captured by the 1 D approach if the losses and the gate characteristics are correctly accounted for, {{at the same time as}} the compressibility is adapted to the air contents of the water and flexibility of the structure. Finally, a coupled 1 D- 3 D method is introduced, that combines the precision of the three-dimensional modelling in regions where the flow is complicated, and the simplicity and speed of the one-dimensional modelling for the pipe system. The simulations are time-resolved. The results obtained with the 1 D- 3 D coupling method are in very good agreement with the experiments, and show that the method works...|$|E

Specifičnost tzv. „brdskih“ izvorišta jest visoka kakvoća vode, ali i promjena izdašnosti u periodu ljeto – zima. Vodoopskrbna konfiguracija u načelu je izgrađena tako da je moguće koristiti se tim vodama, no za njihovu maksimalnu iskoristivost u uvjetima proširenja vodoopskrbnog sustava i uključivanja novih potencijalnih brdskih izvorišta potrebno je ugraditi odgovarajuće regulacijske ventile i postaviti algoritme rada kako bi se vodoopskrba u što većoj mjeri automatizirala. The Požega {{area was}} always characterised by {{scarcity}} of wate for human {{use in the}} summer months. The current well fields {{can be divided into}} well fields in the lowland areas by the Orljava river and hillside water intakes on the foothills of Papuk. Even though the area of Papuk has a relatively large catchment area, due to its specific geological structure there is no possibility for significant accumulation of groundwater {{that could be used for}} water supply to the population throughout the year. However, water from hillside water intakes is of high quality and, due to its elevation, enables water supply without spending additional energy, which is an element that they aimed and still aim to make maximum use of. Thus for a number years the water supply structure has been developed so as to enable receiving hillside water in all seasons and, if necessary, supplement it with water from the well field in the Orljava river valley. Recent hydrogeological research showed that, by drilling deeper in the Papuk hills, additional quantities of water can be encountered that could be, with additional energy consumption, used in the summer months when water shortages occur regularly, which is also an additional burden on the expansion of the public water supply system in the entire Požega area. Inclusion of such well fields in hillside parts of the water supply system with maximum use of existing hillside water intakes would be made possible by forming an adequate water supply structure but, more importantly, by managing and controlling the flow of water from available sources. In order for that to be possible it is necessary to properly install appropriate <b>regulation</b> <b>valves</b> at precisely selected locations that would be connected to the SCADA system.

Disrupted embryonic growth, differentiation, and patterning events that “trigger” SLV disease are coordinated by gene expression changes in endocardial, myocardial, and cushion mesenchymal cells. We explored roles of chromatin <b>regulation</b> in <b>valve</b> gene regulatory networks by conditional inactivation of the Brg 1 -associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex in the endocardial lineage. Endocardial Brg 1 -deficient mouse embryos develop thickened and disorganized SLV cusps that frequently become bicuspid and myxomatous, including in surviving adults. These SLV disease-like phenotypes originate from deficient endocardial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in the proximal outflow tract (pOFT) cushions. The missing cells are replaced by compensating neural crest or other non-EMT-derived mesenchyme. However, these cells are incompetent to fully pattern the valve interstitium into distinct regions with specialized extracellular matrices. Transcriptomics reveal genes that may promote growth and patterning of SLVs and/or serve as disease-state biomarkers. Mechanistic studies of SLV disease genes should distinguish between disease origins and progression; the latter may reflect secondary responses to a disrupted developmental system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Phenotypic {{heterogeneity}} of the endothelium {{has important implications}} for cell sourcing for cardiovascular tissue engineered devices and is fundamental to many cardiovascular diseases. A critical first step to identifying genetic regulators associated with particular endothelial phenotypes is reliable isolation of pure RNA from the cell subpopulations of interest. We present here a rapid method for the isolation of endothelial RNA from small spatially-defined locations, illustrated for two sides of the porcine aortic valve. Endothelial cells were retrieved from fresh tissue by freezing them to a glass substrate, from which they were lysed in guanidine thiocyanate buffer for RNA isolation. Valve endothelial cells isolated by this technique stained positively for CD 31 and von Willebrand factor, consistent with an endothelial phenotype, with no evidence of contamination by α-smooth muscle actin-positive valve interstitial cells or CD 45 -positive leukocytes. RNA integrity was excellent in 80 % of the samples, with over 100 ng of total RNA typically obtained from each side of the valve. This rapid method yields high quality pure endothelial RNA in sufficient quantities for amplification and subsequent use in device-, cell-, and location-specific transcriptional profiling by microarray technologies, and thus facilitates studies of spatial gene <b>regulation.</b> Keywords—Aortic <b>valve,</b> Endothelium, Cell phenotype, Microarray analysis, Porcine...|$|R
