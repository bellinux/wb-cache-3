The U. S. Bureau of Mines is investigating methods to stabilize these arcs. To perform experiments to test new hypotheses, Bureau researchers designed and instrumented an advanced, experimental single-phase furnace. This report describes this furnace, which {{was equipped with}} high-speed data acquisition capabilities for electrical, temperature, pressure, and flow-rate measurements; automated atmosphere control; ballistic calorimetry; and view ports for high-speed cinematography. Precise environmental control and accurate data acquisition allow the statistical design of experiments and assignment of rigorous confidence limits when potential furnace or procedural modifications are tested...|$|E
40|$|The {{erosion of}} hearth {{refractories}} typically governs the asset {{life of a}} blast furnace. Since operating conditions within the hearth make it practically impossible for direct measurement and visualisation, physical and mathematical models {{play an important role}} in understanding and assessing the cause-effect phenomena between the liquid iron, coke bed and refractories. A numerical model has been developed to predict the iron flow and temperature distribution within the packed bed and refractories. A number of case studies have been investigated for Port Kembla’s No. 5 blast furnace, which is entering the 15 th year of its current campaign. These case studies considered the effects of coke free layers (floating/sitting deadman), hearth deposits, coke bed fouling and localised <b>refractory</b> <b>erosion.</b> The refractory temperature distributions predicted by the model compare well with the blast furnace thermocouple measurements and as a result, the model has become a valuable predictive tool for hearth design and control.

40|$|A {{commercial}} scale bottom-blown copper smelting furnace started operation in 2008 by Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals Co. Ltd. A number of advantages {{of this new}} technology have been reported from industrial practice such as high smelting efficiency, low copper content in slag and lower temperature operation. Fluid dynamics of the melt bath play important roles in achieving these advantages {{and there is no}} information available on bottom-blown copper smelting furnace. Lab scale cold model experiments were carried out in this study to understand the features of the bottom-blown copper smelting furnace. Water was used to simulate matte and silicon oil was used to simulate slag. It was found that: 1) mixing time decreases with increasing matte depth and gas flowrate but increases with increasing slag depth and viscosity; 2) different types of transversal standing waves are able to take place on bath surface under certain combination of bath depths and gas flowrates, and these waves are believed to be relevant to splash, mass transfer and <b>refractory</b> <b>erosion</b> in smelting process; 3) in the absence of transversal standing waves, longitudinal wave is present on bath surface, which might be beneficial for slag tapping and settling of matte droplets in slag. The applications of these results on industrial practice are discussed in this paper to understand and improve this new technology...|$|E

Alex Poe is a 15 -year old mixed breed canine with a {{year and}} a half history of bilateral <b>refractory</b> corneal <b>erosion</b> and opacity. Diseases leading to <b>refractory</b> canine corneal <b>erosion</b> are frustrating to handle in a clinical situation unless an appropriate pathologic diagnosis is made. Primary causes of corneal erosion include persistent mechanical irritation, primary corneal epithelial disease, or primary corneal endothelial disease. Conventional therapies for corneal epithelial and corneal endothelial diseases have differed only in the administration of hyperosmotic agents in cases of primary endothelial disease. However, historically primary endothelial disease patients have remained refractory to therapy due to the inability to control corneal edema leading to bullous keratopathy and persistent ulceration. The use of a cautery probe to perform thermokeratoplasty on the cornea has been used in human patients in the past and has shown promise in treating canine corneal endothelial disease.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} clinical and immunological responses to Demodex on the ocular surface. Thirteen eyes in 10 patients with Demodex blepharitis and chronic ocular surface disorders were included in this study and treated by lid scrubbing with tea tree oil for the eradication of Demodex. We evaluated ocular surface manifestations and Demodex counts, and analyzed IL- 1 β, IL- 5, IL- 7, IL- 12, IL- 13, IL- 17, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 β in tear samples before and after the treatment. All patients exhibited ocular surface manifestations including corneal nodular opacity, peripheral corneal vascularization, <b>refractory</b> corneal <b>erosion</b> and infiltration, or chronic conjunctival inflammatory signs before treatment. After treatment, Demodex was nearly eradicated, tear concentrations of IL- 1 β and IL- 17 were significantly reduced and substantial clinical improvement was observed in all patients.

40|$|Solid {{particle}} erosion-wear {{experiments on}} as-prepared mullite-SiC composite refractories by nitriding reactive sintering were performed at elevated temperatures, using sharp black SiC abrasive particles at an impact speed of 50 [*]m/s {{and the impact}} angle of 90 ° in the air atmosphere. The effects of silicon powder addition and erosion temperature on the erosion-wear resistance of mullite-SiC composite refractories were studied. The test results reveal that Si powders caused nitriding reaction to form β-sialon whiskers in the matrix of mullite-SiC composite refractories. The erosion-wear resistance of mullite-SiC composite refractories was improved {{with the increase of}} silicon powder addition and erosion temperature, and the minimum volume erosion rate was under the condition of 12 % silicon added and a temperature of 1400 °C.

40|$|The present {{work was}} {{initiated}} to investigate runnerrefractory corrosion by molten steel. The {{aim was to}} understandthe mechanism of inclusion formation during ingot casting. Thework is also of interest to other unit processes in steelmaking, where refractory corrosion and erosion are seriousproblems. The oxides investigated in the present work werealumina, silica and mullite, which are the main components inrunner refractory. In addition, industrial refractory materialwas investigated. Two types of experiments were conducted. The first, "rodexperiments", involved dipping a rod of the oxide into an ironbath containing varying amounts of oxygen. After quenching, therods were examined through SEM/EDS analysis. In the second setsof experiments, the wetting behaviour of molten iron onrefractory oxides was investigated {{by means of the}} sessile-dropmethod. The reactions were followed in static as well asdynamic modes through contact angle measurements. Temperatureand oxygen partial pressure were, besides time the parametersthat were investigated in the present study. Oxygen partialpressure was defined by introducing a gas mixture of CO-CO 2 -Ar into the furnace. The experimental studies were preceded by a thermodynamicinvestigation of the refractory systems, in order to get afundamental understanding of the reactions that occurred. Phasestability diagrams for the systems were constructed based onthe data available in literature. The diagrams showed that thereaction between alumina and oxygen containing iron would leadto the formation of hercynite at a critical oxygen level in themetal. With silica, the reaction would lead to the formation offayalite. In the mullite case, the reaction products would behercynite at moderate oxygen levels in the melt and hercynitetogether with fayalite at slightly higher oxygenpotentials. For all substrates, the contact angles started decreasing asthe surface-active oxygen came into contact with the iron drop. At a critical level of oxygen in the metal, a reaction productstarted forming at the drop/substrate interface. The reactionproducts were identified through SEM/EDS analysis and werefound to be in agreement with thermodynamic predictions. In thecase of SiO 2 substrate, there were also deep erosion tracksalong the periphery of the drops, probably due to Marangoniflow. Alumina-graphite refractory reactions with molten iron werealso investigated through Monte Carlo simulations. The resultsshowed that, with increased alumina content in the refractory,the carbon dissolution into the melt decreased. Further, thewetting behaviour at the interface was found to be an importantfactor to considerably reduce the carbon dissolution fromalumina-graphite refractories. The experimentation was extended to the commercialrefractories used in the ingot casting process at UddeholmTooling AB, Sweden. The analysis of the plant trial samplesindicates that there is less likelihood of a strong corrosionof the refractories {{that could lead to a}} significant populationof inclusions in the end product. The impact of the presentexperimental results on <b>refractory</b> <b>erosion</b> is discussed.

40|$|In next {{generation}} magnetic fusion {{devices such as}} ITER, plasma-facing materials are exposed to unprecedented high ion, power and neutron fluxes. Those extreme conditions cannot be recreated in current fusion devices from the tokamak type. The plasma-surface interaction is still an area of great uncertainty. At FOM Rijnhuizen, linear plasma generators are used to investigate plasma-material interactions under high hydrogen ion flux-densities up to 10 (25) m(- 2) s(- 1) at low electron temperatures (&lt;= 10 eV), similar to the conditions expected in the divertor of ITER. The incident ion fluxes result in power fluxes of &gt; 10 MW/m(2). A new linear plasma device, MAGNUM-PSI, {{is expected to begin}} regular plasma operations in the middle of 2011. This device can operate in steady-state {{with the use of a}} 3 T super-conducting magnet, and a plasma column diameter projected to 100 mm. In addition, experimental conditions can be varied over a wide range, such as different target materials, plasma temperatures, beam diameters, particle fluxes, inclination angles of target, background pressures, magnetic fields, etc., making MAGNUM-PSI an excellent test bed for high heat flux components of future fusion reactors. Current research is performed on a smaller experiment, Pilot-PSI, which is limited to pulsed operation, a maximum magnetic field of 1. 6 T and a narrow (similar to 20 mm) column width. The research is primarily focused on carbon based materials and <b>refractory</b> metals. <b>Erosion</b> of materials, surface morphology changes as well as hydrogen implantation, diffusion and inventory in the materials are studied under fusion reactor conditions. The influence of neutron damages is studied by irradiation of the materials with high energy ions. A research programme addressing those before mentioned issues is presented...|$|R
40|$|The chamber wall armor faces {{demanding}} {{conditions in}} inertial fusion energy (IFE) chambers. IFE operation is cyclic in nature (~ 1 - 10 Hz) and following each microexplosion, the chamber wall {{is subjected to}} a burst of photons, energetic particles and neutrons. Key issues include; (i) chamber clearing to ensure that after each shot the chamber returns to a quiescent state {{in preparation for the}} target injection and the firing of the driver for the subsequent shot, and (ii) armor lifetime which requires the armor to accommodate the cyclic energy deposition while providing the required lifetime. These requirements are major factors in evolving the choice of armor configuration and material. Dry wall options are particularly amenable to laser IFE and the candidate armor material must provide high temperature resistance and accommodate the operating conditions with minimal <b>erosion.</b> <b>Refractory</b> metals such as tungsten can provide these capabilities and accommodate the high energy deposition [1]. However, a major concern is the possible accumulation of helium from ion implantation. Helium migration in tungsten is slow and the concern is that a build-up of helium could result in local armor failure...|$|R
