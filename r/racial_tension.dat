5|$|In July 1910 <b>racial</b> <b>tension</b> flared {{towards the}} African-American {{community}} after a tremendous upset victory by African-American boxer Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada. Mobs of whites roamed throughout Omaha rioting, {{as they did}} in cities across the U.S. The mobs wounded several black men in the city, killing one.|$|E
5|$|The city saw {{tremendous}} {{industrial and}} population growth during the 19th century and early 20th century, and experienced <b>racial</b> <b>tension</b> and urban decline {{in the second half}} of the 20th century, culminating in the 1967 Newark riots. The city has experienced revitalization since the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{labor and}} {{management}} clashed in bitter strikes, <b>racial</b> <b>tension</b> escalated as blacks were hired as strikebreakers, and ethnic strife broke out. A major riot by earlier immigrants in South Omaha destroyed the city's Greek Town in 1909, completely driving out the Greek population.|$|E

5|$|In Cape Town missionaries {{were being}} accused of causing <b>racial</b> <b>tension</b> and profiteering, and after the Beagle set to sea on 18 June FitzRoy wrote {{an open letter to}} the evangelical South African Christian Recorder on the Moral State of Tahiti {{incorporating}} extracts from both his and Darwin's diaries to defend the reputation of missionaries. This was given to a passing ship which took it to Cape Town to become FitzRoy's (and Darwin's) first published work.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, Boston Globe {{columnist}} Adrian Walker proposed renaming Yawkey Way and Yawkey station {{because their}} current namesake, Tom Yawkey, was a racist {{who made the}} Red Sox the last major league team to hire black players. In August 2017, amid <b>racial</b> <b>tension,</b> the Red Sox organization began advocating {{for the city to}} change the street's name. A bill to change the station's name was filed in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, 1969, {{during a}} parents' weekend, over 80 members of Cornell's Afro-American Society {{took over the}} student union building, Willard Straight Hall. The {{takeover}} was precipitated by increasing <b>racial</b> <b>tension</b> at {{the university and the}} students' frustration with the administration's lack of support for a black studies program. The specific catalysts for the takeover were a reprimand of three black students for an incident the previous December and a cross burning in front of the black women's cooperative and other cases of racism.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s some <b>racial</b> <b>tensions,</b> {{including}} violence, between {{whites and}} Asians occurred, {{and at the}} time the city did not employ any Asian police officers, leaving the Asian population to feel a lack of trust in the police. By 2003 the <b>racial</b> <b>tensions</b> had been greatly reduced, and the Quincy Police Department at that time had Asian officers.|$|R

In the social sphere, Lecrae has advocated for the preservation of responsibility and fatherhood as a value among men in the United States, and in 2013 partnered with Dwyane Wade and Joshua DuBois in the multimedia initiative This Is Fatherhood as part of the Obama administration's Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative. He has also presented on and written about <b>racial</b> <b>tension</b> and injustice in the United States.|$|E
5|$|That evening Kennedy held a {{televised}} {{press conference on}} the possibility of a domestic Peace Corps-like program to reduce racism in white suburbs. On April 8 Kennedy and his wife went, at the request of Coretta Scott King, to Atlanta to attend Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral. That evening he held a meeting with his aides over how {{to get the attention of}} middle-class whites weary of the civil rights movement in order to relieve the <b>racial</b> <b>tension</b> in the country. Kennedy returned to Indiana and on April 10 delivered his third and final speech inspired by King's death. Moving past his previous calls for compassion and an end to violence, he admonished whites to accept and welcome blacks into American society. Throughout the rest of the month, Kennedy toned down his campaign rhetoric and fixed on a theme of unity and reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese at Rock Springs {{were aware}} of the {{animosity}} and rising <b>racial</b> <b>tension</b> with white miners, but had not taken any precautions, as no prior events indicated there would be any race riots. Underlying the outbreak of violence were racism and resentment of the policies of the Union Pacific Coal Department. Until 1875, the mines in Rock Springs were worked by whites; in that year, a strike occurred, and the strikers were replaced with Chinese strikebreakers less than two weeks after the strike began. The company resumed mining with 50 white miners and 150 Chinese miners in its employ. As more Chinese arrived in Rock Springs, bitterness from the white miners increased. At the time of the massacre, there were about 150 white miners and 331 Chinese miners in Rock Springs.|$|E
50|$|Norfolk was {{historically}} {{part of the}} slave-holding South, and {{was later}} segregated along racial lines until the 1960s. This has led to <b>racial</b> <b>tensions</b> within the highly diversified city that {{have been slow to}} heal. Nevertheless, <b>racial</b> <b>tensions</b> have been slowly subsiding overtime as younger generations who have no first-hand recollection of segregation have reached adulthood and started families of their own.|$|R

5|$|After a {{successful}} (8–1–1) football season in 1955, Tech {{was invited to}} play in the 1956 Sugar Bowl in New Orleans against the University of Pittsburgh. It would be the school's fifth straight bowl appearance under renowned coach Bobby Dodd. Pittsburgh had a black starting player, fullback Bobby Grier, but as Tech had played a 1953 game against a desegregated Notre Dame team, and the University of Georgia had very recently played out-of-state games against desegregated opponents, president Van Leer and the Tech Athletic Association saw the game's contract as acceptable. However, <b>racial</b> <b>tension</b> in the South was high following the recent Brown v. Board of Education decision. Georgia Governor Marvin Griffin had privately given Dodd his support, but he surprised the campus and the state on Friday, December 2, 1955 by bowing to pressure from segregationists and sending a wire to the Georgia Board of Regents chairman, Robert O. Arnold, requesting not only that Tech not play the game, but that all University System of Georgia teams play only segregated games.|$|E
5|$|William Huskisson's death {{made him}} one of the most famous British {{politicians}} of the period. Within a year his first biography was published, as was a volume of his collected speeches. His policies on free trade and minimal government interference were a major influence on Robert Peel and William Ewart Gladstone (who grew up in Liverpool and whose father Sir John Gladstone had been a close colleague of Huskisson) and consequently on the later emergence of the Liberal Party and the doctrine of Gladstonian Liberalism. Forty years after his death Huskisson was still sufficiently well-remembered to be featured in novels, including Middlemarch and the novels of Mrs Henry Wood, with no accompanying explanation. The Australian town of Huskisson, New South Wales is named for him. Huskisson Dock, named in his honour in 1852, remains in operation as part of the Port of Liverpool. In 1880 Huskisson railway station in Liverpool opened, closing to passengers five years later but remaining operational as a goods depot until 1975. Today he is principally remembered for the manner of his death, and monuments to him stand in Pimlico, Chichester Cathedral, and Liverpool. In 1982, at a time of high <b>racial</b> <b>tension</b> following the Toxteth riots, his memorial in Liverpool was pulled down by a group of local people in the mistaken belief that it commemorated a slave trader; it was re-erected around 20 years later in Duke Street, near where he had stayed for his final nights in Liverpool.|$|E
