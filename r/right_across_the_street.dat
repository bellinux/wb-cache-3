500|$|In July 2005, then-Harvard {{assistant}} coach Bill Holden saw that Lin was [...] tall, which fit the physical attributes he was seeking, {{and he had}} a 4.2 grade point average in high school, which met Harvard's academic standards. But Holden was initially unimpressed with Lin's on-court abilities, and told Lin's high school basketball coach, Peter Diepenbrock, that Lin was a [...] "Division III player". Later that week, Holden saw Lin playing in a much more competitive game, driving to the basket at every opportunity with the [...] "instincts of a killer", and Lin became a top priority for him. Harvard coaches feared that Stanford, close to Lin's home, would offer Lin a scholarship, but it did not, and Lin chose to attend Harvard. [...] "I wasn't sitting there saying all these Division I coaches were knuckleheads," [...] Diepenbrock said. [...] "There were legitimate questions about Jeremy." [...] Joe Lacob, incoming Warriors owner and Stanford booster, said Stanford's failure to recruit Lin [...] "was really stupid. The kid was <b>right</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> [...] you can't recognize that, you've got a problem." [...] Kerry Keating, the UCLA assistant who offered Lin the opportunity to walk-on, said in hindsight that Lin would probably have ended up starting at point guard for UCLA.|$|E
50|$|By June 2013, the Hudson River Park trust was in debt. A {{bill passed}} in June 2013 ended {{maintenance}} of {{a section of the}} park in Battery Park City, as well as the purchase of liability insurance, which would give $750,000 in savings to the park. However, the park was to run a $8.5 million deficit for fiscal year 2014. To further ameliorate the debt, the bill provided for the trust to make passengers pay to board sightseeing cruise ships in the park. Finally, the bill allowed the park to sell air <b>rights</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from <b>the</b> park, specifically St. John's Terminal across from Pier 40. In addition, Pier 40, which would have garnered large profits for the park, would cost more than $100 million to renovate.|$|R

The {{customer}} is revealed to be Tom (a recurring character throughout the series), who is at first happy that he finally got his pizza, until he discovers {{he did not get}} the drink he claims to have asked for. A confused SpongeBob checks the order, which says that Tom didn't order a drink (although it is heavily implied that Mr. Krabs didn't hear Tom's order correctly or that he hung up before Tom had a chance to finish). His blood boiling with anger, Tom harshly berates SpongeBob and refuses to take the pizza or pay for it before slamming the door. SpongeBob goes back to Squidward and collapses to the ground and cries (while absorbing his tears). Infuriated that Tom berated SpongeBob and won't pay for the pizza all because of a missing drink (making the long journey and the ridiculous obstacles the duo went through a complete waste of time), Squidward confronts Tom who arrogantly says, [...] "Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't payin' for that!" [...] to which Squidward angrily claims, [...] "Well, this one's on the house!" [...] and brutally shoves the pizza into Tom's face as payback for his rudeness. Squidward then goes back to SpongeBob who, stilling crying, asks, [...] "Did he change his mind?" [...] Squidward cheers him up by saying, [...] "He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite." [...] The two then drive back to the Krusty Krab, which is comically revealed to be <b>right</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> much to Squidward's dismay, who then says [...] "Oh, my aching tentacles!".|$|E

"On Hooligan Alley, as I {{prefer to}} call the street our {{headquarters}} was on, there was a row of flat 'dobe houses with red tile roofs, some straw shacks full of Indians and dogs, and one two-story wooden house with balconies a little farther down.

He had also not long to wait, for a patter of footsteps flung back by the white walls grew louder, and Appleby noticed that while they had rung sharp and decided they appeared to slacken as the man approached the wine‐shop. This appeared significant, since it suggested that the man did not wish to cross the stream of light.|$|R

He built and urbanized a large portion of Savamala, including the building of the Belgrade Cooperative, Hotel Bristol and other buildings. He managed to obtain a permit from the city authorities to plant a European-style garden on his land. He planted roses, ornamental plants and trees and personally took care of the garden for years.
