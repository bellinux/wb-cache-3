50|$|Adjusting the slit to only allow {{electrons}} {{which have}} lost a specific amount of energy {{can be used to}} obtain elementally sensitive images. As the ionisation signal is often significantly smaller than the background signal, it is normally necessary to obtain more than one image at varying energies to remove the background effect. The simplest method is known as the jump ratio technique, where an image recorded using electrons at the energy of the maximum of the absorption peak caused by a particular inner shell ionisation is divided by an image recorded just before the ionisation energy. It is often necessary to cross-correlate the images to compensate for <b>relative</b> <b>drift</b> of the sample between the two images.|$|E

Calculations indicate that appreciable ion temperature anisotropies can be induced at altitudes below about 220 km. The temperature anisotropy is with respect to the ion-neutral <b>relative</b> <b>drift</b> velocity vector, with the ion temperature parallel to the <b>relative</b> <b>drift</b> velocity greater than the perpendicular ion temperature. The parallel to perpendicular ion temperature ratio is likely to be in the range of from 2 to 4, depending on the ionospheric conditions.

40|$|We perform 2. 5 D hybrid {{simulations}} {{to investigate}} the origin and evolution of <b>relative</b> <b>drift</b> speeds between protons and α particles in the collisionless turbulent low-β solar wind plasma. We study the generation of differential streaming by wave-particle interactions and absorption of turbulent wave spectra. Next {{we focus on the}} role of the relative drifts for the turbulent heating and acceleration of ions in the collisionless fast solar wind streams. The energy source is given by an initial broad-band spectrum of parallel propagating Alfvén-cyclotron waves, which co-exists with the plasma and is self-consistently coupled to the perpendicular ion bulk velocities. We include the effect of a gradual solar wind expansion, which cools and decelerates the minor ions. This paper for the first time considers the combined effect of self-consistently initialized dispersive turbulent Alfvénic spectra with differentially streaming protons and α particles in the expanding solar wind outflows within a 2. 5 D hybrid simulation study. In the non-expanding wind, we find a threshold value of the differential streaming V_α p = 0. 5 V_A, for which the <b>relative</b> <b>drift</b> speed remains nearly steady. For ions, streaming below the threshold value, the waves act to increase the magnitude of the <b>relative</b> <b>drift</b> speed. Ions, which stream faster than the threshold value become subject to nonlinear streaming instability and as the system evolves their bulk velocities decrease. We find that the solar wind expansion strongly affects the <b>relative</b> <b>drift</b> speeds and significantly slows down both ion species for all values of the <b>relative</b> <b>drift</b> speeds considered in this study.

40|$|By {{employing}} a local two-fluid theory, we investigate an obliquely propagating electromagnetic {{instability in the}} lower hybrid frequency range driven by cross-field current or <b>relative</b> <b>drifts</b> between electrons and ions. The theory self-consistently takes into account local cross-field current and accompanying pressure gradients. It is found that the instability is caused by reactive coupling between the backward propagating whistler (fast) waves in the moving electron frame and the forward propagating sound (slow) waves in the ion frame when the <b>relative</b> <b>drifts</b> are large. The unstable waves we consider propagate obliquely to the unperturbed magnetic field and have mixed polarization with significant electromagnetic components. A physical picture of the instability emerges {{in the limit of}} large wavenumber characteristic of the local approximation. The primary positive feedback mechanism is based on reinforcement of initial electron density perturbations by compression of electron fluid via induced Lorentz force. The resultant waves are qualitatively consistent with the measured electromagnetic fluctuations in reconnecting current sheet in a laboratory plasma.

Many fundamental operations of WSN such as Time Synchronization among nodes and sink, routing of data, clustering of nodes, localization schemes, data aggregation and dissemination consume excess part of the energy utilized. To optimize energy consumption, this paper focuses on the time synchronization between nodes and the cluster head within the cluster, to reduce the <b>relative</b> <b>drift</b> of clocks between two different nodes at two different times thus reducing the synchronization error. We prove the minimization of the <b>relative</b> <b>drift</b> of clocks through a mathematical model with few assumptions on applications.

40|$|We {{present results}} here from 2. 5 -D particle-in-cell {{simulations}} {{showing that the}} electrostatic (ES) components of broadband extremely low frequency (BBELF) waves could possibly be generated by cross-field plasma instabilities driven by the <b>relative</b> <b>drifts</b> between the heavy and light ion species in the electromagnetic (EM) Alfvenic component of the BBELF waves in a multi-ion plasma. The ES components consist of ion cyclotron as well as lower hybrid modes. We also demonstrate that the ES wave generation is {{directly involved in the}} transverse acceleration of ions (TAI) as commonly measured with the BBELF wave events. The heating is affected by ion cyclotron resonance in the cyclotron modes and Landau resonance in the lower hybrid waves. In the simulation we drive the plasma by the transverse electric field, E(sub y), of the EM waves; the frequency of E(sub y), omega(sub d), is varied from a frequency below the heavy ion cyclotron frequency, OMEGA(sub h), to below the light ion cyclotron frequency, OMEGA(sub i). We have also performed simulations for E(sub y) having a continuous spectrum given by a power law, namely, |Ey| approx. omega(sub d) (exp -alpha), where the exponent alpha = _, 1, and 2 in three different simulations. The driving electric field generates polarization and ExB drifts of the ions and electrons.

The <b>relative</b> <b>drifts</b> between the charged-particle species drive waves, which energize the plasma. Using 2. 5 -dimensional (2. 5 -D) particle-in-cell simulations, we study this process of wave generation and its nonlinear consequences in terms of acceleration and heating plasma. Specifically, we study the situation for LFA wave frequency being lower than the heavy-ion cyclotron frequency in a multi-ion plasma. We impose such a wave to the plasma assuming that its wavelength is much larger {{than that of the}} waves generated by the <b>relative</b> <b>drifts.</b> For better understanding, the LFA-wave driven simulations are augmented by those driven by initialized ion beams. The driven high-frequency (HF) wave modes critically depend on the heavy ion density nh; for small values of nh, the lower hybrid (LH) waves dominate. On the other hand, for large nh a significantly enhanced level of waves occurs over a much broader frequency spectrum below the LH frequency and such waves are interpreted here as the ion Bernstein (IB) mode near the light ion cyclotron harmonics. Irrespective of the driven wave modes, both the light and heavy ions undergo significant transverse acceleration, but for the large heavy-ion densities, even the electrons are significantly accelerated in the parallel direction by the waves below the LH frequency. Even when the LFA wave drive is maintained, the ion heating leads to the cessation of HF wave excitation just after a few cycles of the former wave.

These instabilities represent local sources of turbulence with a wide frequency range extending from the lower hybrid to the electron cyclotron. Their linear features are analyzed by means of both a dispersion study and numerical PIC simulations. Three main types of TSI and correspondingly excited waves are identified: i. Oblique whistlers due to the (so-called fast) <b>relative</b> <b>drift</b> between reflected ions/electrons; the waves propagate toward upstream away from the shock front at a strongly oblique angle (θ [*]∼[*] 50 °) to the ambient magnetic field B o, have frequencies a few times the lower hybrid, and have wavelengths a fraction of the ion inertia length c ∕ ω pi. ii.
