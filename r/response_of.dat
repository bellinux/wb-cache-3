40|$|AbstractAttention {{is thought}} to be {{controlled}} by a specialized fronto-parietal network that modulates the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> neurons in sensory and association cortex. However, the principles by which this network affects the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> these sensory and association neurons remains unknown. In particular, it remains unclear whether different forms of attention, such as spatial and feature-based attention, independently modulate <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> single neurons. We recorded <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> single V 4 neurons in a task that controls both forms of attention independently. We find that the combined effects of spatial and feature-based attention can be described as the sum of independent processes with a small super-additive interaction term. This pattern of effects demonstrates that the spatial and feature-based aspects of the attentional control system can independently affect <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> single neurons. These results are consistent with the idea that spatial and feature-based attention are controlled by distinct neural substrates whose effects combine synergistically to influence <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> visual neurons...|$|R

40|$|Electrophysiological {{recordings}} {{have been}} used to characterize responses mediated by AMPA receptors expressed by cultured rat cortical and spinal cord neurones. The EC 50 values for AMPA were 17 and 11 [*]μM, respectively. <b>Responses</b> <b>of</b> cortical neurones to AMPA were inhibited competitively by NBQX (pKi= 6. 6). Lower concentrations of NBQX (⩽ 1 [*]μM) also potentiated the plateau <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> spinal cord neurones to AMPA, which could be attributed to a depression of desensitization to AMPA. GYKI 52466 inhibited <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> spinal cord neurones to AMPA to about twice the extent <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> cortical neurones. Blockade of AMPA receptor desensitization by cyclothiazide (CTZ) potentiated <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> spinal cord neurones (6. 8 fold) significantly more than <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> cortical neurones (4. 8 fold). <b>Responses</b> <b>of</b> cortical neurones to KA were potentiated 3. 5 fold by CTZ, while <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> spinal cord neurones were unaffected. Ultra-fast applications of AMPA to outside-out patches showed <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> spinal cord neurones desensitized by 97. 5 % and exhibit marked inward rectification, whereas cortical neurones desensitized by 91 % and exhibited slight outward rectification. The time constants of deactivation and desensitization were about twice as fast in spinal cord than cortical neurones. In cortical neurones, single-cell RT[*]–[*]PCR showed GluR 2 and GluR 1 accounted for 91 % of all subunits and were expressed together in 67 % of neurones, predominantly as the flip variants (78 %). GluR 2 was detected alone in 24 % of neurones. GluR 3 and GluR 4 were present in only 14 and 29 % of neurones, respectively. For spinal cord neurones, GluR 4 o was detected in 81 % of neurones, whereas predominantly flop versions of GluR 1, 2 and 3 were detected in 38, 13 and 13 % of neurones, respectively. These expression patterns are related to the respective pharmacological and mechanistic properties...|$|R

Expressions for the standard errors of these maximum and minimum mean values are provided. The difference between the maximum and minimum means, {{in addition to the}} magnitudes of their standard errors, vary inversely with the proportion of re-turns [...] I t is also shown that {{the extent to which the}} <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> returnees to a survey item are representative <b>of</b> the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> the total sample is a function of sample size, proportion of returns, and proportion of returnees responding to the item in a specified direction. Formulas are derived for computing (1) the probability that the difference between the proportion of returnees who respond in a specified direction and the proportion of the total sample responding in that direction will be equal to or greater than an acceptable value, and (2) the minimum proportion of returns required to be fairly confident that the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> returnees are representative <b>of</b> the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> the total sample. SURVEY researchers are often faced with the problem of a low proportion of returns and whether the returnees are representative of the total sample (Madge, 1965). Even after one or two follow-ups, a sizable proportion of the sample may still fail to respond. To determine if the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> returnees differ significantly from those of non-returnees, it is recommended that in well-supported surveys a random sample of the non-returnees be interviewed in person or by telephone. Tests of differences in the mean <b>responses</b> or proportion <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> returnees and non-returnees to specif-ic items or composites may then be conducted to determine if the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> the two groups differ significantly.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel {{strategy for the}} <b>response</b> enhancement <b>of</b> olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) -based biosensors by monitoring the enhancive <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> OSNs to odorants. An OSNs-based biosensor was developed {{on the basis of}} the light addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS), in which rat OSNs were cultured on the surface of LAPS chip and served as sensing elements. LY 294002, the specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), was used to enhance the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> OSNs to odorants. The <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> OSNs to odorants with and without the treatment of LY 294002 were recorded by LAPS. The results show that the enhancive effect of LY 294002 was recorded efficiently by LAPS and the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> this OSNs-LAPS hybrid biosensor were enhanced by LY 294002 by about 1. 5 -fold. We conclude that this method can enhance the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> OSNs-LAPS hybrid biosensors, which may provide a novel strategy for the bioelectrical signal monitor of OSNs in biosensors. It is also suggested that this strategy may be applicable to other kinds of OSNs-based biosensors for cellular activity detection, such as microelectrode array (MEA) and field effect transistor (FET) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the written <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> skilled and less skilled readers to either an {{original}} or an adapted story, and the written <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> less skilled readers to either an original or an adapted short story. Data were compared relative to three areas: (1) statistical analysis of frequency of clausal units, and categorization of clausal units according to recall, inference, and supplementation; (2) statistical analysis of selected elements of the short story, specifically, setting, characterization, plot, and theme; and (3) descriptive analysis <b>of</b> frequent <b>responses</b> within each subcategory. Ninth grade students designated as skilled and less skilled readers by scores on the California Achievement Test formed two distinct sample populations. Subjects were randomly assigned to read either an original short story or an adaptation of the same story and write all they could recall, including selected elements of the short story, namely, setting, characterization, plot, and theme. Findings indicated that in terms of frequency of clausal units and categorization of clausal units, the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> skilled readers to the original story contained significantly more clausal units and inference statements than the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> less skilled readers. The <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> less skilled readers to the adapted story contained significantly more clausal units and inference statements than the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> less skilled readers to the original story.
