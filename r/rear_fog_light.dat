50|$|The {{special edition}} Kadett Holiday {{came with a}} {{standard}} package of extras, chief among which were a steel sliding sun roof, sports wheels, large fog lights at the front and a <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>light,</b> and high-backed front seats incorporating stylish wrap-around head restraints.|$|E
2500|$|In Europe {{and other}} {{countries}} adhering to UN Regulation 48, vehicles must be equipped {{with one or two}} bright red [...] "rear fog lamps", which serve as high-intensity rear position lamps to be turned on by the driver in conditions of poor visibility to make the vehicle more visible from the rear. The allowable range of intensity for a <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> lamp is 150 to 300 candela, which is within the range of a U.S. stop lamp (brake <b>light).</b> <b>Rear</b> <b>fog</b> lamps are not required equipment in the U.S., but they are permitted, and are found almost exclusively on European-brand vehicles in North America. Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes, MINI, Land Rover, Porsche, Saab and Volvo provide functional <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lights</b> on their North American models. Some vehicles from non-European brands which are adaptions of European-market offerings, such as the first generation Ford Transit Connect, come standard with <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lights,</b> or vehicles with European market counterparts, such as the second generation Chrysler 300, have an option for them. The final generation Oldsmobile Aurora also had dual <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lights</b> installed in the rear bumper as standard equipment.|$|R
25|$|September 1979 - Revisions: {{all models}} fitted with {{flush-fitting}} headlights, restyled seats, front door pockets, additional fascia vents, new badging and <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lights.</b> Protective side mouldings on GL models. Optional three-speed automatic transmission available on L and GL models.|$|R
50|$|The first-generation LHS, sold in Europe {{with the}} New Yorker {{nameplate}} during the 1995-1997 model years, featured rear amber turn signals, <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lights,</b> side turn signal repeaters, lack of side markers, and headlamps that incorporated different lens geometry and bulbs.|$|R
50|$|Importing {{rules for}} the UK are stringent; all {{vehicles}} must undergo Individual Vehicle Approval to assure compliance with applicable ECE Regulations or British national equivalents.

5000|$|... 1979 - Revisions to all models: driver's side <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>light</b> {{and rear}} seat belts. The R20 TS {{got a new}} cooling fan, inertia reel rear seat belts, a new {{windscreen}} wiper switch, and {{the choice of a}} 5-speed gearbox. The R30 TS got a more powerful [...] engine, and small pocket in the drivers sun visor.|$|E
50|$|The Opel GT {{roadster}} {{differs from}} the Saturn Sky in very few, but subtle areas. It features a cigarette lighter on the driver's side door, two ashtrays (one on each door), a passenger-side storage cubby (instead of a speaker grate, behind the passenger seat), and a <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>light.</b> Opel made these changes {{to appeal to the}} European market, and because in Europe the Opel GT was considerably more expensive than the Saturn Sky, due to its captive-import status.|$|E
5000|$|This is why {{in regions}} using this connector, {{trailers}} {{on the road}} are occasionally seen with the <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lights</b> on {{when they should be}} off. (Vehicle wired for +12V, permanent or via ignition and trailer wired for fog lamps) ...|$|R
50|$|All the European {{models have}} the 6-speed manual transmission, {{and was just}} marketed as 1.8 VVT-i and 1.8 VVTL-i 190 or T-Sport, which are the GT and GT-S, respectively.

50|$|Sometimes, the {{existing}} lighting on a vehicle {{is modified to}} create warning beacons. In the case of wig-wag lighting, this involves adding a device to alternately flash the high-beam headlights, or, in some countries, the <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lights.</b> It can also involve drilling out other lights on the vehicle to add ‘hideaway’ or ‘corner strobes’.|$|R
50|$|Y10 Fire: The new {{entry-level}} version, the Fire, was now {{standard equipment}} {{with a lower}} price, estimated at one million lire. This model was recognizable by the front with a frame in matte black and black grille, (in contrast to Fire '85 that had a polished stainless steel frame and a grid in silver), the taillights were simplified and asymmetrical, with only a reversing light {{to the right and}} only one headlight on the left <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>light.</b> Inside had cloth upholstery and a new dashboard. There were no doors on compartments or drawers.|$|E
50|$|There is {{no simple}} {{relationship}} between the scattering cross section and the physical size of the particles, as the scattering cross section depends on the wavelength of radiation used. This can be seen when driving in foggy weather: the droplets of water (which form the fog) scatter red light less than they scatter the shorter wavelengths present in white light, and the red <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>light</b> can be distinguished more clearly than the white headlights of an approaching vehicle. That {{is to say that}} the scattering cross section of the water droplets is smaller for red light than for light of shorter wavelengths, even though the physical size of the particles is the same.|$|E
50|$|February 1980 - Introduction of the Fuego three-door coupé. Available as TL and GTL with 1,397 cc engine (rated at , with manual choke), and GTS with 1,647 cc engine (rated at , with {{automatic}} choke), with 4-speed manual gearbox on TL and GTL, 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic gearbox on GTS. TL has basic equipment level with 155 SR 13 tires, heated rear window, <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>light,</b> split/fold rear seat, and cloth upholstery.

5000|$|The Camry in Taiwan and Southeast Asia of this {{generation}} looked very similar to other versions, but the front end had a [...] "thicker" [...] grille and larger, all-white, differently shaped headlights. The reverse lights were moved onto the trunk above the added <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lights</b> and were somewhat similar to the lights on a second generation Avalon's trunk.

5000|$|A facelifted variant was {{released}} in August 2009 as the Maruti Suzuki Estilo, losing the Zen moniker entirely. This transition has brought about a steady decline in sales, though the facelift brought significant improvements in performance and styling over the car's Japanese variants. The facelifted model featured refreshed styling and the Suzuki K10B 1.0-litre three-cylinder (12-valve) MPFI engine, producing a maximum power output of [...] at 6200 rpm and 92 Nm (68 lb-ft) of torque at 3500 rpm. This model also sported a slightly stiffer rear three-link suspension setup {{in an effort to}} curb body roll and improve stability at high speed. Features such as <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>light,</b> rear defroster, new instrument console and new interior colours were also added to enhance appeal.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{generation}} Saga shares its platform with the outgoing generation, but its 'top hat' or {{body in white}} (BIW) is all-new {{as the result of}} extensive re-engineering during its development process. With the exception of the wing mirror housings, all other exterior body panels are new and unique to the {{third generation}} Saga. The new Saga has a sleeker external profile, and its drag coefficient has been reduced to 0.33 [...] Proton's three new 2016 sedans, namely the Perdana, Persona and Saga were all designed concurrently, resulting in a strong family resemblance. The new Saga features halogen reflector headlamps like its predecessors, but its rear lamps have reverted to more conventional bulb-based lighting as opposed to LEDs, to cut costs and pricing. However, all new Saga variants get a <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>light</b> as standard and Proton lettering inserts for both front and rear lamps. The new Saga is also the third model to feature Proton's new sculptured, three-dimensional badge.|$|E
50|$|The European and British {{versions}} {{were installed}} with standard headlight washers and rear fog lights, so that other drivers {{could see them}} in inclement weather and at night. European models also received glass-lens halogen headlights that could have the distance the light was projected adjusted from an electric switch installed on the dashboard, and also received speed sensitive, variable effort power steering, and both items were standard installed. The Australian-spec sedan and wagon were equipped with the <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>light,</b> but not the headlight washers. The British and Europeans could also install a front bumper bull bar and an 8 mm thick steel sump guard that extended from the bottom edge of the front bumper to the front suspension. The Europeans could not get an in-dash cupholder located in the small space below the HVAC controls and above the stereo, found in the Australian, USA and Japanese models. In that location instead is a clock, and a button to deploy an electric radio antenna, if so equipped. Clocks are integrated with the OEM stereo internationally.|$|E
25|$|All coupes {{came with}} a vinyl roof as standard. Since the coupe lacked B-pillars, the roof flexed enough that the paint used by Jaguar at the time would develop cracks. More modern paints do not suffer such problems, so {{whenever}} a coupe is repainted it is viable to remove the vinyl. Today many XJ-Cs no longer have their vinyl roof, also removing the threat of roof rust. Some owners also modified their XJ-C by changing to Series III bumpers. This lifted the front indicators from under the bumper and provided built in <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
50|$|In October 1976, a {{year after}} introduction, a new de luxe version of the Kitten, branded as the Kitten DL, was announced. Improvements {{included}} revised springs and dampers and a changed anti-roll bar but mainly the DL model was an uprated interior improvement packaged which included more comfortable seats which reclined & tilted, modified door trims incorporating a map pocket made of coloured vinyl, a parcel shelf, volt meter & oil pressure gauge, radio with twin speakers, chrome hubcaps with chrome surrounds, extra additional carpet, front and <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lights</b> {{and in some cases}} rear reversing lights.|$|R
50|$|Nissan Sunny was {{the badge}} {{used for the}} European-delivered GTI-R. They had a {{different}} chassis number of EGNN14. The engine output specifications (220 PS / 162 kW and 267 Nm / 197 lb·ft) were slightly less due to the electronic control unit having different fuel and ignition maps {{to compensate for the}} lower octane fuel available in those areas. The Sunny GTI-R had several physical differences to the Pulsar, such as the rear number plate surround and <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lights.</b> The interior also varied from the Pulsar with some of the more basic trim from the RB model.|$|R
50|$|The new Persona {{shares the}} same basic body {{structure}} with the Iriz, but its exterior design has been completely re-engineered {{to give it a}} more distinct persona. With the exception of the windscreen, front doors, wing mirrors housings and front fenders, all other exterior body panels are unique to the BH Persona. Proton has maintained their original 'Stylish Executive' design philosophy from the CM Persona, fusing it with the newer 'Proton Wings' language first seen in the Prevé, as well as the company's new sculptured, three-dimensional badge. However, unlike the Iriz, the new Persona features more basic height-adjustable halogen reflector headlamps and bulb-lit rear lamps, in an effort to reduce costs and pricing. Daytime running lights (DRL) are also absent, but all variants get a <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>light</b> as standard. Both front and rear lamps have Proton lettering inserts, and the BH Persona is the first Proton saloon to feature wing mirrors that are mounted on the door panel, helping improve visibility {{with the addition of a}} front quarter glass insert.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{the many}} cars fitted with towbars, most {{are likely to}} have fitted towing {{electrics}} which are ‘hidden’ from the car. This electrical installation is commonly called ‘By-pass electrics’. This system is used to protect the car's lighting systems from potential damage if wiring in a trailer should malfunction. It is a tried and tested system in very wide use. Bypass systems are found both in [...] "universal" [...] (non-vehicle-specific) systems and in dedicated and OEM systems. Since the early 2000s, vehicle technology has moved forward introducing CANbus network systems which allowed the interaction of different systems, and also the detection of a trailer or caravan. In some cases, the manufacturers have not only designed automobiles to sense the presence of a trailer, but they have also created enhanced new features within the systems connected to the network. This actually makes it important that these particular vehicles can [...] "see" [...] the trailer or caravan. A few of these new features are for safety and stability, but most are merely convenience things like automatically switching off the <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>light</b> and parking sensors. The main new safety feature, appearing now on some cars, is the Trailer Stability Program which automatically turns on when a trailer detected in the network through the dedicated sensors.|$|E
40|$|In this report, the {{magnitude}} of the problem of rear-end collisions is described. The report also draws up a test framework based on a theoretical approach and a judgement of various recent provisions for improving the rear light configuration. These provisions include: regulation of light intensity; rear fog lights; braking-dependant lights; early-warning brake lights; lights activated by emergency stopping; and solutions reducing the wearing out of lamps. The test framework makes it possible to judge inventions on their necessity, functioning, and optical features. Adjustments to the rear light configuration during the last decennia involved addition of a component (third brake light, <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>light).</b> In this, existing functions were improved so that a gradual introduction could be applied (only new cars). As an adjustment often has consequences for the whole rear light configuration, it is concluded that `Europe' was justly reserved. Once good arguments for introducing a new function or component (necessitating) are presented, the complete renewal of the rear light configuration can be considered. Matters such as integration, standardisation, and adaptive regulation then become relevant. Recommendations are made for further adjustments to the rear light configuration. These adjustments are also aimed at improving the present functions, so that retrofit is unnecessary. These are: making two rear fog lights mandatory; voluntary regulation of light intensity; voluntary alarm lights for emergency stops; and voluntary alarm lights after an emergency stop...|$|E

The success of the Speedster led to the expanded line of 1956 Hawks.|$|R
5000|$|In 1975, Volkswagen de Mexico ordered two {{specially}} made pickups from Germany, {{one single}} cab and one double cab, for the Puebla plant. These were evaluated {{for the possibility}} of building pickups in Mexico, and were outfitted with every option except the Arctic package, including front and <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lights,</b> intermittent wipers, trip odometer, clock, bumper rubber, PVC tilt, and dual doors on the single cab storage compartment. VW de Mexico was interested in having the lights, wiring, brake systems and other parts manufactured in Mexico. Ultimately, VW de Mexico declined to produce pickups, and the pickups were sold to an Autohaus, a Volkswagen dealer in San Antonio, Texas, since they could not be sold in Mexico. By law, no German-made Volkswagens were to be sold in Mexico. These are probably the only pickups that were produced in Germany for Mexican import, and have the [...] "ME" [...] export code on the M-code plate. The green double cab was sold to a new owner in New York, and has been lost track of. The light gray (L345, licht grau) single cab still exists. Pickups were not manufactured in Mexico, nor were they imported into Mexico from Germany, save for these two examples.|$|R
