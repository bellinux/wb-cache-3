Inlet <b>reverse</b> <b>flow</b> normally starts to occur at about half of the shock-free inlet capacity, and this has no relation to the best efficiency flow.

40|$|Hemodynamic forces play an {{important}} role in the non-uniform distribution of atherosclerotic lesions. Endothelial cells are exposed simultaneously to fluid wall shear stress (WSS) and solid circumferential stress (CS). Due to variations in impedance (global factors) and geometric complexities (local factors) in the arterial circulation a time lag arises between these two forces that can be characterized by the temporal phase angle between CS and WSS (stress phase angle-SPA). Asynchronous flows (SPA close to - 180 °) that are most prominent in coronary arteries have been associated with localization of atherosclerosis. <b>Reversing</b> oscillatory <b>flows</b> characterized by an oscillatory shear index (OSI) that is great than zero are also associated with atherosclerosis localization. In this study we examined the relationship between asynchronous <b>flows</b> and <b>reversing</b> <b>flows</b> in altering the expression of 37 genes relevant to atherosclerosis development. In the case of <b>reversing</b> oscillatory <b>flow,</b> we observed that the asynchronous condition upregulated 8 genes compared to synchronous hemodynamics, most of them proatherogenic. Upregulation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NFκB p 65 was confirmed by western blot, and nuclear translocation of NFκB p 65 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. A comparative study between non-reversing <b>flow</b> and <b>reversing</b> <b>flow</b> found that in the case of synchronous hemodynamics, <b>reversing</b> <b>flow</b> altered the expression of 11 genes, while in the case of asynchronous hemodynamics, <b>reversing</b> <b>flow</b> altered the expression of 17 genes. <b>Reversing</b> <b>flow</b> significantly upregulated protein expression of NFκB p 65 for both synchronous and asynchronous conditions. Nuclear translocation of NFκB p 65 was confirmed for synchronous and asynchronous conditions in the presence of flow reversal. These data suggest that asynchronous hemodynamics and <b>reversing</b> <b>flow</b> can elicit proatherogenic responses in endothelial cells compared to synchronous hemodynamics without shear stress reversal, indicating that SPA as well as reversal flow (OSI) are important parameters characterizing arterial susceptibility to disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: To assess from {{diagnosis}} to delivery the Doppler {{studies of}} the umbilical artery, middle cerebral artery, umbilical vein, ductus venosus, and amniotic fluid index of fetuses with idiopathic growth restriction. METHODS: A total of 145 singleton growth-restricted fetuses with abnormal umbilical artery pulsatility indexes were studied. Cesarean delivery was performed because of abnormal biophysical profile or nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern. RESULTS: There were 4 fetal and 50 neonatal deaths. Two growth-restricted groups were identified: Group A (n = 44) included fetuses in whom all measures became abnormal preceding an abnormal biophysical profile or nonreassuring nonstress test. Group B (n = 101) included fetuses in whom 1 or more measures were normal {{at the time of}} cesarean delivery. There was no statistically significant difference in perinatal morbidity and mortality between the 2 groups. Neonatal death was increased in fetuses with umbilical artery <b>reversed</b> <b>flow</b> (odds ratio 2. 34, 95 % confidence interval 1. 16 - 4. 73; P <. 05) and ductus venosus <b>reversed</b> <b>flow</b> (odds ratio 4. 18, 95 % confidence interval 2. 01 - 8. 69; P <. 05).
