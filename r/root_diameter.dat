40|$|Objective: Uric acid (UA) is {{considered}} to be a powerful predictor of cardiovascular risk and hyperuricemia might be involved in the metabolic syndrome (MS). This study aims to investigate the relation between UA levels and aortic root dilatation. Methods: A total of 348 hypertensive patients [age (67. 5 ± 9. 8) years] with or without MS were included in the study. The aortic <b>root</b> <b>diameters</b> at the aortic annulus, the sinuses of Valsalva, the sinotubular junction, and the proximal part of the ascending aorta were measured using a two-dimensional (2 D) echocardiography. Serum UA levels were also measured for all patients. Results: A high UA level is independently associated with aortic <b>root</b> <b>diameters</b> at the sinuses of Valsalva (P= 0. 001) and the proximal ascending aorta (P< 0. 0001) in the hypertensive patients without MS. In contrast, aortic <b>root</b> <b>diameters</b> were not significantly related to UA levels in the hypertensive patients with MS. Furthermore, increased UA levels were associated with an increased risk for aortic root dilatation in the patients without MS (sex-adjusted hazard ratio 1. 75, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 1. 27 – 2. 41), but not in those with MS. Conclusions: This study demonstrated an independent relationship between the aortic root dimensions and increased levels of serum UA in the hypertensive patients without MS.

40|$|Background. Aortic {{insufficiency}} {{secondary to}} degenerative aneurysms of the ascending aorta can be surgically treated with {{replacement of the}} valve or with remodeling of the aortic root. Methods. In 15 patients who underwent aortic root remodeling from January 1994 to December 1996, we evaluated the postoperative aortic regurgitation and correlated it with several anatomic and functional variables. Operative success {{was defined as a}} residual aortic regurgitation {{less than or equal to}} 1 on a scale of 0 to 4. Results. Root dimensions and aortic incompetence decreased significantly after the operation (p < 0. 0001). The difference between preoperative and postoperative <b>root</b> <b>diameters</b> (p = 0. 0006) and the presence of Marfan's syndrome (p < 0. 0001) were independently predictive of persisting significant aortic insufficiency. Operative success was obtained in patients with a difference between preoperative and postoperative <b>root</b> <b>diameters</b> smaller than 30 mm. Conclusions. Aortic root remodeling is effective in reducing aortic regurgitation. Severe aortic root dilatation may result in excessive geometric alteration, leading to suboptimal results. The choice of a larger graft contributes to avoiding excessive geometric constraint of a profoundly diseased aortic root. Indication to undergo root remodeling should be evaluated cautiously in patients with Marfan's syndrome. (Ann Thorac Surg 1998; 66 : 1269 - 72...|$|R

40|$|Establishment {{of maize}} {{seedlings}} {{can be difficult}} at low soil moisture content. Anatomy of root metaxylem vessels may influence the capacity for water transport and respective genotypic differences might be useful for selection purposes. To test this, six tropical maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars were grown in large PVC tubes containing a sandy substrate at 5 % (M 5) and 10 % (M 10) moisture contents for 2 weeks. The percentage changes in <b>root</b> <b>diameters</b> due to M 5 was similar for most cultivars but differed for main <b>root</b> types. <b>Root</b> <b>diameters</b> were not consistently related to metaxylem structure, but in a few cases, thin <b>roots</b> had smaller <b>diameter</b> metaxylem vessels.

Generally, the ratio of cross-sectional areas between late and early metaxylem vessels increased from primary to seminal and nodal roots. Within the cultivar Tuxpefio this ratio was much reduced by M 5. A few cultivars maintained the combined cross-sectional areas of metaxylem vessels at M 5 in some main root types, but only one cultivar could achieve this for the total of cross-sectional areas of metaxylem vessels, calculated over all root axes, by increasing the number of seminal and nodal roots.

40|$|Abstract: Riparian {{vegetation}} exerts {{a number}} of mechanical and hydrologic controls on streambank stability, which affect the delivery of sediment to channels. Estimates of root-reinforcement of soils have commonly been attained using perpendicular root models that simply sum root tensile strengths and consider these as an add-on factor to soil strength. A major limitation of such perpendicular models is {{that the effect of}} variations in soil moisture and bank geotechnical properties on root-reinforcement are omitted as root tensile strengths are considered to be independent of soil type and moisture. In reality, during mass failure of a streambank, some roots break, and some roots are pulled out of the soil intact; the relative proportions of roots that break or pull out are determined by soil moisture and shear strength, and root strengths. In this paper an equation to predict the frictional resistance of root-soil bonds was tested against field data collected at Long Creek, MS, under two soil moisture conditions. The root pullout equations were then included in the root-reinforcement model, RipRoot, and bank stability model runs for Goodwin Creek, MS, were carried out in order {{to examine the effects of}} spatial and temporal variations in soil shear strength and rooting density, on streambank factor of safety. Model results and collected filed data showed that at low <b>root</b> <b>diameters</b> breaking forces exceeded pullout forces, but at higher <b>root</b> <b>diameters</b> pullout forces exceed breaking forces.

50|$|The {{goal of the}} {{operation}} is to eliminate the aneurysm according to its individual extent and to preserve or repair the aortic valve. The operation may have to include replacement of the aortic root. Replacement of the root is usually not necessary if its diameter is less than 40 to 45 mm. In those instances replacement of the ascending aorta (so-called tubular aorta) is sufficient. If <b>root</b> <b>diameter</b> exceeds 45 mm {{it will have to}} be replaced in many instances. There are mainly 2 operative techniques currently used, which are frequently named after their inventors. Both lead to similar results. With both techniques the aortic valve must be carefully assessed after replacement of the root; repair of any aortic valve abnormalities is necessary in order to achieve good and durable valve function.|$|E
50|$|If the {{dilation}} of the aorta progresses to a significant-diameter aneurysm, {{causes a}} dissection or a rupture, or leads to {{failure of the}} aortic or other valve, then surgery (possibly a composite aortic valve graft or valve-sparing aortic root replacement) becomes necessary. Although aortic graft surgery (or any vascular surgery) is a serious undertaking it is generally successful if undertaken on an elective basis. Surgery {{in the setting of}} acute aortic dissection or rupture is considerably more problematic. Elective aortic valve/graft surgery is usually considered when aortic <b>root</b> <b>diameter</b> reaches 50 mm, but each case needs to be specifically evaluated by a qualified cardiologist. New valve-sparing surgical techniques are becoming more common. As Marfan patients live longer, other vascular repairs are becoming more common, e.g., repairs of descending thoractic aortic aneurysms and aneurysms of vessels other than the aorta.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{compression}} of each stage is ~10, each stage {{closer to the}} outlet is considerably smaller than the preceding inlet stages. This has two consequences. The geometric progression tells us that infinite stages could ideally fit into a finite axial length. The finite length {{in this case is}} the full height of the housing as the bearings, the motor, and controller and some of the coolers can be installed inside on the axis. Radially, to grasp as much of the thin gas at the entrance, the inlet-side rotors would ideally have a larger radius, and correspondingly higher centrifugal force; ideal blades would get exponentially thinner towards their tips and carbon fibers should reinforce the aluminium blades. However, because the average speed of a blade affects pumping so much this is done by increasing the <b>root</b> <b>diameter</b> rather than the tip diameter where practical.|$|E

The soil compaction factor consists of 3 levels, which are 1, 5 g/cm 3 (A 1), 1, 2 g/cm 3 (A 2), and 0, 9 g/cm 3 (A 3) respectively, while the soil water content also consists of 3 levels, which are 60, 41 % (B 1), 49, 64 % (B 2), and 42, 86 % (B 3) for each level.
