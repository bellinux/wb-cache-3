5|$|Based on {{an anecdote}} about the Second World War by the <b>Romani</b> {{historian}} Jacques Sigot, {{the film was}} inspired by a <b>Romani</b> who escaped the Nazis with help from French villagers. It depicts the rarely documented subject of Porajmos (the <b>Romani</b> Holocaust). Other than a band of <b>Romani</b> people, the film has a character based on Yvette Lundy, a French teacher who was active in the French resistance and deported to a concentration camp for forging passports for <b>Romani.</b> Gatlif had intended to make a documentary but the lack of supporting documents led him to present it as a drama.|$|E
5|$|Because Eastern European <b>Romani</b> {{communities}} were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos {{was not well}} documented. There also existed a trend to downplay the actual figures, according to Ian Hancock, director of the Program of <b>Romani</b> Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Tony Gatlif, whose films mostly have <b>Romani</b> people as subjects, had long {{wanted to make a}} documentary on this less well-known subject, but the lack of enough documented evidence coupled with the absence of accurate pre-war census figures for the <b>Romani</b> made it difficult.|$|E
5|$|Erromintxela {{is a mixed}} {{language}} (referred to as Para-Romani in <b>Romani</b> linguistics), deriving most of its vocabulary from Kalderash <b>Romani</b> {{but using}} Basque grammar, {{similar to the way}} the Angloromani language of the Roma in England mixes <b>Romani</b> vocabulary and English grammar. The development of the mixed language was facilitated by the unusually-deep integration of the Erromintxela people into Basque society and the resultant bilingualism in Basque. The language is in decline; most of the perhaps 1000 remaining speakers live on the coast of Labourd and in the mountainous regions of Soule, Navarre, Gipuzkoa and Biscay. The Erromintxela are the descendants of a 15th-century wave of Kalderash Roma, who entered the Basque Country via France. Both ethnically and linguistically, they are distinct from the Caló-speaking <b>Romani</b> people in Spain and the Cascarot <b>Romani</b> people of the Northern Basque Country.|$|E

5|$|Gatlif {{wanted to}} {{represent}} the entire <b>Romani</b> community through the characterization of Félix Lavil dit Taloche's naiveté and purity. For example, Taloche is shown as being afraid of ghosts, which echoes the <b>Romani</b> phobia. For Taloche's role, Gatlif needed a musician with acrobatic skills, which {{was very hard to}} find. In Paris at the Théâtre de la Ville, he was impressed James Thiérrée, a grandson of Charlie Chaplin. A non-Romani, (though Chaplin's grandmother was <b>Romani)</b> Thiérrée learned Romanes and <b>Romani</b> swing music in six months.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of those}} killed at Treblinka were Jews, but about 2,000 <b>Romani</b> people also died there. Like the Jews, the <b>Romani</b> were first rounded up {{and sent to the}} ghettos; at a conference on 30 January 1940 it was decided that all 30,000 <b>Romani</b> living in Germany proper were to be {{deported}} to former Polish territory. Most of these were sent to Jewish ghettos in the General Government, such as those in Warsaw and Łódź. As with the Jews, most <b>Romani</b> who went to Treblinka died in the gas chambers, although some were shot. The majority of the Jews living in ghettos were sent to Bełżec, Sobibór, or Treblinka to be executed; most of the <b>Romani</b> living in the ghettos were shot on the spot. There were no known <b>Romani</b> escapees or survivors from Treblinka.|$|E

5000|$|The {{use of the}} Spanish word [...] "gitano" [...] {{to refer}} to <b>Romanis</b> in Spain evolved from [...] "egiptano" [...] {{in the same way}} that the English word [...] "Gypsy" [...] evolved from the term [...] "Egyptian" [...] to refer to <b>Romanis.</b> Both terms are due to some <b>Romanis,</b> upon their first arrivals to Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries, {{claiming}} to be Egyptians for a more favourable treatment by local Europeans, or being mistaken as Egyptians by local Europeans.|$|R

5|$|The German and Ottoman {{objective}} {{was not to}} cross the canal, but to capture <b>Romani</b> and establish a strongly entrenched heavy artillery position opposite Kantara, from which to bombard shipping on the canal. Kress von Kressenstein's plan for the attack on <b>Romani</b> was to bombard the line of defensive redoubts with heavy artillery and employ only weak infantry detachments against them, while his main force launched attacks against the right and rear of the <b>Romani</b> position.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} {{the area was}} held by British forces with their main bases at <b>Romani</b> and Kantara. Regular patrols and reconnaissances were carried out over the oases area, until the issue was {{resolved}} at the Battle of <b>Romani</b> in August 1916 when British Empire forces won a decisive victory.|$|E

5|$|On 24 April, the {{day after}} the Katia and Oghratina, Chauvel, {{commander}} of the Anzac Mounted Division, was placed in command of all the advanced troops: the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades at <b>Romani</b> and an infantry division; the 52nd (Lowland) at Dueidar. The infantry moved forward to <b>Romani</b> between 11 May and 4 June 1916.|$|E
5|$|Reinforcements from <b>Romani,</b> {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel R. M. Yorke, attacked the Ottoman {{force to the}} north of Katia, but were driven off. These five troops and a machine gun section of Gloucestershire Hussars moved out from <b>Romani</b> at 10:15 to intercept a column of 500 Ottoman soldiers retiring south-east from Dueidar. Shortly after leaving <b>Romani,</b> firing was heard from Katia, and from some high ground they could see the Ottoman artillery north of Er Rabah shelling the camp. When the Gloucestershire Hussars advanced towards the Ottoman artillery, it ceased fire, and fifteen minutes later was seen to withdraw some distance. The Gloucestershire Hussars pushed some Ottoman soldiers back to the high ground south of the Hod um Ugba, where Ottoman reinforcements stopped their advance. The strength of the Ottoman attacks made a gradual withdrawal necessary, but long halts were made to enable the wounded at <b>Romani</b> to retire also.|$|E
5|$|The Erromintxela {{arrived in}} the Basque Country in the 15th century {{speaking}} Kalderash <b>Romani.</b> They integrated much more deeply into Basque society than other <b>Romani</b> groups. In the process, they acquired the Basque language and adopted aspects of Basque culture such as increased rights of women and important traditions such as bertsolaritza (extemporaneous poetic song) and pelota (the national Basque ballgame). Muñoz and Lopez de Mungia suspect that the morphological and phonological similarities between <b>Romani</b> and Basque facilitated the adoption of Basque grammar by the bilingual Romanis.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{had moved}} out at dawn, {{followed}} by the 5th Mounted Brigade without ambulance support, as the New Zealand Field Ambulance had not returned from <b>Romani</b> and the 5th Mounted Field Ambulance had not yet arrived. Fortunately, casualties were light, and both ambulances arrived in the evening. The 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance, had formed a dressing station at Bir Nagid {{to the south of}} <b>Romani,</b> treating wounded from 3rd Light Horse Brigade's engagement at Bir el Hamisah, a convoy brought in wounded Ottomans from a hod to the south of <b>Romani,</b> and 150 cases of heat exhaustion from infantry in the 42nd Division were treated during the day.|$|E
