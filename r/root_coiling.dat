The 50 cell trays were designed in Queensland, Australia and prevent <b>root</b> <b>coiling</b> while promoting air pruning of roots. The trays are a substantial improvement over the traditional polythene bag which is widely used in Australia and the Philippines to grow seedlings. Use of the trays is proposed as an extension aid {{in the provision of}} assistance to individual Filipino farmers. Evaluation of their use will be undertaken using a constructivist methodology to determine impediments to the uptake of tree farming from a farmer 2 Ì† 7 s perspective...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{studies show}} that plant root morphologies can vary widely from {{straight}} gravity-aligned primary roots to fractal-like root architectures. However, the opaqueness of soil {{makes it difficult to}} observe how environmental factors modulate these patterns. Here, we combine a transparent hydrogel growth medium with a custom built 3 D laser scanner to directly image the morphology of Medicago truncatula primary roots. In our experiments, root growth is obstructed by an inclined plane in the growth medium. As the tilt of this rigid barrier is varied, we find Medicago transitions between randomly directed <b>root</b> <b>coiling,</b> sinusoidal root waving, and normal gravity-aligned morphologies. Although these root phenotypes appear morphologically distinct, our analysis demonstrates the divisions are less well defined, and instead, {{can be viewed as a}} 2 D biased random walk that seeks the path of steepest decent along the inclined plane. Features of this growth response are remarkably similar to the widely known run-and-tumble chemotactic behavior of Escherichia coli bacteria, where biased random walks are used as optimal strategies for nutrient uptake.

Angkor scholar Maurice Glaize observed, [...] "On every side, in fantastic over-scale, the trunks of the silk-cotton trees soar skywards under a shadowy green canopy, their long spreading skirts trailing the ground and their endless <b>roots</b> <b>coiling</b> more like reptiles than plants." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{rare case}} of radicular {{pain in the}} arm due to {{compression}} of the C 6 nerve <b>root</b> by <b>coiling</b> of the vertebral artery is reported; the diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and echocolordoppler. Although the enlargement of an intervertebral foramen by a tortuous vertebral artery has been described previously, the occurrence of radicular pain is exceptional. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR angiography and echocolordoppler allow to differentiate foraminal enlargement due to vascular anomalies of the vertebral artery from that more commonly due to tumor compression, mainly from neurinoma. Surgical decompression may be considered in symptomatic cases...|$|R
50|$|Aristocleidus is a genus of Monogenea erected by Justus F. Mueller in 1936. The genus {{has been}} revised by Delane Kritsky and Edgar F. Mendoza-Franco in 2008. The amended generic {{diagnosis}} is: species with gonads overlapping, ventral anchors with deeply incised base forming deep and superficial <b>roots,</b> a <b>coiled</b> tube {{of the male}} copulatory organ (nonarticulated with the accessory piece) in a clockwise orientation, and haptoral hooks with upright acute thumb, slender shank comprising one subunit and FH loop.Two new species, parasitic in the Mexican mojarra Eugerres mexicanus (Perciformes, Gerreidae) from southwestern Mexico have been described by Edgar F. Mendoza-Franco, Marina Tapia Osorio and Juan Manuel Caspeta-Mandujano in 2015.|$|R
40|$|Optimal root {{architecture}} is established by multiple intrinsic (e. g. hormones) and extrinsic (e. g. gravity and touch) signals and is established, in part, by directed root growth. We show that asymmetrical exposure of cytokinin (CK) {{at the root}} tip in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) promotes cell elongation that is potentiated by glucose in a hexokinase-influenced, G protein-independent manner. This mode of CK signaling requires the CK receptor, ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE 4 and, at a minimum, its cognate type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS ARR 1, ARR 10, and ARR 11 for full responsiveness, while type A response regulators act redundantly to attenuate this CK response. Ethylene signaling through the ethylene receptor ETHYLENE RESISTANT 1 and its downstream signaling element ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 are required for CK-induced root cell elongation. Negative and positive feedback loops are reinforced by CK regulation of {{the expression of the}} genes encoding these elements in both the CK and ethylene signaling pathways. Auxin transport facilitated by PIN-FORMED 2 as well as auxin signaling through control of the steady-state level of transcriptional repressors INDOLE- 3 -ACETIC ACID 7 (IAA 7), IAA 14, and IAA 17 via TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 /AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN are involved in CK-induced root cell elongation. This action lies downstream of ethylene and CK induction. Intrinsic signaling in this response operates independently of the extrinsic signal touch, although actin filament organization, which is important in the touch response, may be important for this response, since latrunculin B can induce similar growth. This root growth response may have adaptive significance, since CK responsiveness is inversely related to <b>root</b> <b>coiling</b> and waving, two root behaviors known to be important for fitness...|$|E
40|$|Thigmomorphogenesis is a stereotypical {{developmental}} alteration in {{the plant}} body plan that can be induced by repeatedly touching plant organs. To unravel how plants sense and record multiple touch stimuli we performed a novel forward genetic screen based {{on the development of}} a shorter stem in response to repetitive touch. The touch insensitive (ths 1) mutant identified in this screen is defective in some aspects of shoot and root thigmomorphogenesis. The ths 1 mutant is an intermediate loss-of-function allele of VERNALIZATION INDEPENDENCE 3 (VIP 3), a previously characterized gene whose product is part of the RNA polymerase II-associated factor 1 (Paf 1) complex. The Paf 1 complex is found in yeast, plants and animals, and has been implicated in histone modification and RNA processing. Several components of the Paf 1 complex are required for reduced stem height in response to touch and normal <b>root</b> slanting and <b>coiling</b> responses. Global levels of histone H 3 K 36 trimethylation are reduced in VIP 3 mutants. In addition, THS 1 /VIP 3 is required for wild type histone H 3 K 36 trimethylation at the TOUCH 3 (TCH 3) and TOUCH 4 (TCH 4) loci and for rapid touch-induced upregulation of TCH 3 and TCH 4 transcripts. Thus, an evolutionarily conserved chromatin-modifying complex is required for both short- and long-term responses to mechanical stimulation, providing insight into how plants record mechanical signals for thigmomorphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Jasmonates (JAs) are {{plant hormones}} {{produced}} in plants during normal development and during exposure to stresses. JAs {{are required for}} plant development and defense. Stresses such as wounding the leaves increase the endogenous JA level and stunt plant growth. Exogenous JA reduces size of leaves and roots. The present study reports that the mechanism of JA-induced root growth inhibition was by reducing mitosis in the RAM and reducing cell elongation in the root elongation zone. Moreover, this study indicates a novel role for auxin in the JA-induced inhibition of root growth: JA reduced exogenous auxin-induced DR 5 ::GUS expression and suppressed acropetal and basipetal auxin transport. Furthermore, under stresses such as wounding and salinity, the JA biosynthesis mutant aos had less inhibition of root growth than wild type, indicating a role for endogenous JA {{in response to these}} stresses. The root growth inhibition by JA involves other hormone signaling pathways, including GA, ABA, and auxin. For example, JA and GA had antagonistic effects in the regulation of <b>root</b> growth and <b>COIl</b> was partially required for root growth response to GA. COIl or endogenous JA signaling suppressed the inhibition of germination by ABA. MeJA induced flavonoid acted as an auxin inhibitor by causing an inhibition of auxin transport in roots. JA was found to interact with light in the regulation of plant defence and development. This study presents evidence that JA partially mimiced photomorphogenesis in dark-grown seedlings. A previous report showed that far red (FR) reduces plant sensitivity to JA. In the present study however FR did not suppress JA-induced growth response, gene expression, and defence against a pathogen. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
