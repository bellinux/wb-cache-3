40|$|Calmodulin (CaM) is a {{ubiquitous}} intracellular {{protein that}} regulates biological activities of numerous enzymes and ion channels. Upon <b>responding</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + concentration change, Ca 2 +- dependent CaM activates the hydrolyzation of cGMP by PDE and Ca 2 + releasing channel activity of ryanodine receptor. In this dissertation, {{a series of}} CaM variants were engineered to enhance Ca 2 + binding affinities by {{increasing the number of}} negative charged residues in individual EF-hand. The capability of shifting the biphasic Ca 2 +-activation profile of RyR 1 is significantly altered by changing Ca 2 + binding affinity of CaM at the C-terminal. This indicates that examining Ca 2 +-CaM affinity is a valid strategy to tune the activation profile of CaM-regulated ion channels. To further understand interactions between CaM and RyR 1, NMR was used to determine their binding mode. To dissect roles of structural components of CaM in metal binding and regulation of biological functions of target proteins, we created half-CaMs and Del-CaM. Binding affinities of these variants to Ca 2 +, Tb 3 + and Gd 3 + were determined by fluorescence spectroscopy; functional studies were conducted using single channel analysis and PDE function assay. Another objective of my dissertation is to design a protein based contrast agent for molecular imaging. CaM was selected as the scaffold protein for designing Gd 3 + based MRI contrast agent by modifying metal binding sites as well as grafting a biomarker peptide into the linker region to specifically target cancers with efficient and optimized modifications. The physical kinetic properties and animal imaging effects of these designed contrast agents were investigated by various methods...|$|E

Individual fibres within small bundles were injected with furaptra, a low-affinity, rapidly <b>responding</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + indicator. In response to a single action potential at 16 °C, the peak amplitude and half-duration {{of the change in}} myoplasmic free [Ca 2 +] (Δ[Ca 2 +]) differed significantly between fibre types (slow-twitch: peak amplitude, 9. 4 ± 1. 0 μM (mean ± S. E. M.); half-duration, 7. 7 ± 0. 6 ms; fast-twitch: peak amplitude 18. 5 ± 0. 5 μM; half-duration, 4. 9 ± 0. 3 ms). SR Ca 2 + release was estimated from Δ[Ca 2 +] with a computational model that calculated Ca 2 + binding to the major myoplasmic Ca 2 + buffers (troponin, ATP and parvalbumin); buffer concentrations and reaction rate constants were adjusted to reflect fibre-type differences. In response to an action potential, the total concentration of released Ca 2 + (Δ[CaT]) and the peak rate of Ca 2 + release ((d/dt) Δ[CaT]) differed about 3 -fold between the fibre types (slow-twitch: Δ[CaT], 127 ± 7 μM; (d/dt) Δ[CaT], 70 ± 6 μM ms− 1; fast-twitch: Δ[CaT], 346 ± 6 μM; (d/dt) Δ[CaT], 212 ± 4 μM ms− 1). In contrast, the half-duration of (d/dt) Δ[CaT] was very similar in the two fibre types (slow-twitch, 1. 8 ± 0. 1 ms; fast-twitch, 1. 6 ± 0. 0 ms). When fibres were stimulated with a 5 -shock train at 67 Hz, the peaks of (d/dt) Δ[CaT] in response to the second and subsequent shocks were much smaller than that due to the first shock; the later peaks, expressed as a fraction of the amplitude of the first peak, were similar in the two fibre types (slow-twitch, 0. 2 – 0. 3; fast-twitch, 0. 1 – 0. 3). The results support the conclusion that individual SR Ca 2 + release units function similarly in slow-twitch and fast-twitch mammalian fibres...|$|E
40|$|Ca 2 + {{release from}} the sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} (SR) of skeletal muscle {{takes place at the}} triadic junctions; following release, Ca 2 + spreads within the sarcomere by diffusion. Here, we report multicompartment simulations of changes in sarcomeric Ca 2 + evoked by action potentials (APs) in fast-twitch fibers of adult mice. The simulations include Ca 2 + complexation reactions with ATP, troponin, parvalbumin, and the SR Ca 2 + pump, as well as Ca 2 + transport by the pump. Results are compared with spatially averaged Ca 2 + transients measured in mouse fibers with furaptra, a low-affinity, rapidly <b>responding</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + indicator. The furaptra ΔfCaD signal (change in the fraction of the indicator in the Ca 2 +-bound form) evoked by one AP is well simulated under the assumption that SR Ca 2 + release has a peak of 200 – 225 μM/ms and a FDHM of ∼ 1. 6 ms (16 °C). ΔfCaD elicited by a five-shock, 67 -Hz train of APs is well simulated under the assumption that in response to APs 2 – 5, Ca 2 + release decreases progressively from 0. 25 to 0. 15 times that elicited by the first AP, a reduction likely due to Ca 2 + inactivation of Ca 2 + release. Recovery from inactivation was studied with a two-AP protocol; the amplitude of the second release recovered to > 0. 9 times that of the first with a rate constant of 7 s− 1. An obvious feature of ΔfCaD during a five-shock train is a progressive decline in the rate of decay from the individual peaks of ΔfCaD. According to the simulations, this decline is due to a reduction in available Ca 2 + binding sites on troponin and parvalbumin. The effects of sarcomere length, the location of the triadic junctions, resting [Ca 2 +], the parvalbumin concentration, and possible uptake of Ca 2 + by mitochondria were also investigated. Overall, the simulations indicate that this reaction-diffusion model, which was originally developed for Ca 2 + sparks in frog fibers, works well when adapted to mouse fast-twitch fibers stimulated by APs...|$|E

40|$|The enzyme {{monoamine oxidase}} (MAO) {{is linked to}} mental {{disorders}} such as depression and neurodegenerative diseases. Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that increases in calcium (Ca 2 +) can enhance MAO activity and that this might contribute to Alzheimer disease (AD). AD {{has been linked to}} gain-of-function mutations in the presenilin- 1 (PS- 1) protein that not only promote the generation of the toxic amyloid-â peptide, but that also alter intracellular Ca 2 + availability. Radioenzymatic MAO assays were used to demonstrate that over-expression of different AD-related PS- 1 mutant proteins, i. e. Y 115 H, ÄEx 9 and M 146 V, in hippocampal-derived HT- 22 cells alter either basal and/or Ca 2 +-sensitive MAO-A activity. The effects of PS- 1 mutant proteins on the availability of intracellular Ca 2 + are not consistent suggesting that {{this may not be the}} primary means of regulating MAO activity. The sensitivity of MAO to Ca 2 + was also demonstrated in cortical (both MAO-A and MAO-B <b>responded</b> to <b>Ca</b> 2 +) and cerebellar (only MAO-A <b>responded</b> to <b>Ca</b> 2 +) samples from transgenic mice overexpressing the PS- 1 (M 146 V) mutation. These changes in MAO coincided with changes in the availability of the neurotransmitters dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin in the cerebellum, but not in the cortex, and reflect the known regional differences in neurotransmitter regulation. Immunoprecipitation studies and the observed increase in MAO-A activity following in vitro chemical inhibition of the ã-secretase complex (comprising several proteins including PS- 1) support the notion that PS- 1 constitutively associates with MAO-A. These effects on Ca 2 +-sensitive MAO function could contribute to AD-related pathology and could also contribute to the depression often associated with AD...|$|R

CA did not stimulate cyclic AMP (cAMP) produc-tion in whole follicles isolated before (morning) or after (evening) the preovulatory gonadotropin surge on Day 28, while newly formed corpora lutea found on Day 29 <b>responded</b> to <b>CA.</b> Ge from the preovulatory follicles did not <b>respond</b> to <b>CA</b> when tested immediately after isolation. Ge were cultured for various periods in Eagle’s MEM without serum and subsequently tested for a possible stimulation of cAMP and steroidogenic responses by CA. In Ge from follicles isolated in the morn-ing (AM-Ge) and cultured for 12 or 24 h, no response to CA was found, while the Ge isolated in the evening (PM-Ge) and cultured similarly for 12 h showed a marked response to CA both in stimulation of cAMP and progesterone production. By a total or partial elimination of the gonadotropin surge. using pentobarbital in combination with luteinizing hormone (LH) or using specific antisera to LI-I or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{it was found that}} previous exposure to LH was necessary for the PM-Ge to develop CA responsiveness during culture. Further, it was possible to induce CA responsiveness in AM-Ge by treatment of rats with LH for a short period in vivo followed by a period of culture. The appear-ance of CA responsiveness in PM-Ge cultured for 12 h was abolished when eycloheximide (5 pg/mI) was present during culture. It appears that the following three conditions have to be satisfied for the isolated Ge to develop CA responsiveness: 1) exposure to LH in vivo, 2) culture for a short period, and 3) an active protein synthesis. it is concluded that under physiological conditions the process of luteinization is associated with acquisition of responsiveness to CA and this process depends on the LI-I component of the preovulatory gonadotropin surge...|$|R
40|$|The time {{course of}} Ca 2 + and GTP-analogue effects on insulin {{secretion}} {{was investigated in}} HIT-T 15 cells permeabilized with Staphylococcus alpha-toxin. These cells <b>responded</b> to <b>Ca</b> 2 + in the range 0. 1 - 10 microM and {{could be used in}} a dynamic perifusion system because of the minimal run-down of the secretory response. High Ca 2 + (10 microM) elicited a monophasic ATP-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion that reached a peak within 5 min (approximately 20 -fold increase) and rapidly decreased during the subsequent 15 min to a plateau remaining above basal rates (0. 1 microM Ca 2 +). The decrease in Ca(2 +) -induced insulin secretion with time could not be attributed to decreased capacity to <b>respond</b> to <b>Ca</b> 2 + after prolonged perfusion at low Ca 2 + (run-down), nor to depletion of a particular secretory-granule pool. It was rather due to desensitization of the secretory machinery to Ca 2 + that was not reversed by selective inhibition of the Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent kinase II with KN- 62. However, an intermediate Ca 2 + concentration (2 microM) increased insulin secretion to stable level without causing any desensitization. Imposed oscillations of Ca 2 + (0. 1 - 10 microM) produced phasic oscillations of insulin secretion, but did not prevent desensitization to Ca 2 +. Poorly hydrolysable GTP analogues increased insulin secretion at low Ca 2 +, whereas they strongly inhibited Ca(2 +) -induced insulin secretion. By contrast, GTP did not affect basal secretion, and slightly increased Ca(2 +) -evoked secretion. These results indicate the following. (1) Oscillations of insulin secretion are tightly coupled to cytosolic Ca 2 + oscillations. (2) Oscillations of Ca 2 + do not prevent high-Ca(2 +) -induced desensitization to Ca 2 +; this result does not support the idea of a greater efficiency of oscillations compared with sustained Ca 2 + rises in triggering exocytosis.

A mitochondrial Ca 2 + channel known as the uniporter drives the rapid and massive entry of Ca 2 + ions into mitochondria.

GdL 2 and GdL 3 also <b>respond</b> to different <b>Ca</b> 2 + concentration ranges, however with a lower selectivity since the r 1 changes are also observed in the presence of other cations such as Mg 2 +, Zn 2 + or Cu 2 +. Assessment of the hydration number (q) via luminescence lifetime measurements confirmed that the change in q is responsible for the r 1 response for all the complexes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the adult}} {{olfactory}} bulb (OB) of vertebrates, local GABAergic interneurons (INs) mediate recurrent and lateral inhibition between the principal neurons of the OB, the mitral cells (MCs), and play pivotal {{roles in the}} processing of odor-evoked activity patterns. The properties and functions of INs in the developing OB are, however, not well understood. We studied the functional development of INs in the OB of living zebrafish larvae 3 – 6 days postfertilization using anatomical techniques and in-vivo two-photon Ca 2 + imaging. We identified MCs and INs by cell-type-specific expression of transgenic fluorescent markers {{and found that the}} IN : MC ratio was lower than in the adult fish. Moreover, the fraction of INs <b>responding</b> with <b>Ca</b> 2 + signals to a set of natural odors was substantially lower than in adults. Odors of different chemical classes evoked overlapping patterns of Ca 2 + signals that were concentrated {{in the center of the}} IN layer. The GABAA receptor agonists GABA and muscimol strongly suppressed odor responses, whereas a GABAA receptor antagonist enhanced responses and altered the spatial distribution of odor-evoked activity. These results indicate that IN odor responses at early developmental stages are sparse and exhibit no obvious chemotopic organization. Nevertheless, GABAergic signaling is already inhibitory at early stages of OB development and strongly influences odor-evoked activity patterns. Hence, INs already participate in the processing of odor information at very early stages of OB development even though the majority of INs emerge only at later stages...|$|R
40|$|The {{trigger for}} {{synaptic}} vesicle exocytosis is Ca 2 +, which enters the synaptic bouton following action potential stimulation. However, spontaneous release of neurotransmitter also {{occurs in the}} absence of stimulation in virtually all synaptic boutons. It has long been thought that this represents exocytosis driven by fluctuations in local Ca 2 + levels. The vesicles responding to these fluctuations are thought to be the same ones that release upon stimulation, albeit potentially triggered by different Ca 2 + sensors. This view has been challenged by several recent works, which have suggested that spontaneous release is driven by a separate pool of synaptic vesicles. Numerous articles appeared during the last few years in support of each of these hypotheses, and it has been challenging to bring them into accord. We speculate here on the origins of this controversy, and propose a solution that is related to developmental effects. Constitutive membrane traffic, needed for the biogenesis of vesicles and synapses, is responsible for high levels of spontaneous membrane fusion in young neurons, probably independent of Ca 2 +. The vesicles releasing spontaneously in such neurons are not related to other synaptic vesicle pools and may represent constitutively releasing vesicles (CRVs) rather than bona fide synaptic vesicles. In mature neurons, constitutive traffic is much dampened, and the few remaining spontaneous release events probably represent bona fide spontaneously releasing synaptic vesicles (SRSVs) <b>responding</b> to <b>Ca</b> 2 + fluctuations, along with a handful of CRVs that participate in synaptic vesicle turnover...|$|R
40|$|The phylum Apicomplexa {{comprises}} a {{group of}} obligate intracellular parasites of broad medical and agricultural significance, including Toxoplasma gondii and the malaria-causing Plasmodium spp. Key to their parasitic lifestyle {{is the need to}} egress from an infected cell, actively move through tissue, and reinvade another cell, thus perpetuating infection. Ca 2 +-mediated signaling events modulate key steps required for host cell egress, invasion and motility, including secretion of microneme organelles and activation of the force-generating actomyosin-based motor. Here we show that a plant-like Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase (CDPK) in T. gondii, TgCDPK 3, which localizes to the inner side of the plasma membrane, is not essential to the parasite but is required for optimal in vitro growth. We demonstrate that TgCDPK 3, the orthologue of Plasmodium PfCDPK 1, regulates Ca 2 + ionophore- and DTT-induced host cell egress, but not motility or invasion. Furthermore, we show that targeting to the inner side of the plasma membrane by dual acylation is required for its activity. Interestingly, TgCDPK 3 regulates microneme secretion when parasites are intracellular but not extracellular. Indeed, the requirement for TgCDPK 3 is most likely determined by the high K+ concentration of the host cell. Our results therefore suggest that TgCDPK 3 ’s role differs from that previously hypothesized, and rather support a model where this kinase plays a role in rapidly <b>responding</b> to <b>Ca</b> 2 + signaling in specific ionic environments to upregulate multiple processes required fo...|$|R
40|$|Metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptor 1 � (mGluR 1 �) exerts important {{effects on}} numerous neurological processes. Although mGluR 1 � {{is known to}} <b>respond</b> to extracellular <b>Ca</b> 2 � ([Ca 2 �] o) and the crystal structures of the extracellular domains (ECDs) of several mGluRs have been determined, the calciumbinding site(s) and structural determinants of Ca 2 �-modulated signaling in the Glu receptor family remain elusive. Here, we identify a novel Ca 2 �-binding site in the mGluR 1 � ECD using a recently developed computational algorithm. This predicted site (comprising Asp- 318, Glu- 325, and Asp- 322 and the carboxylate side chain of the receptor agonist, Glu) is situated in the hinge region in the ECD of mGluR 1 � adjacent to the reported Glu-binding site, with Asp- 318 involved in both Glu and calcium binding. Mutagenesis studies indicated that binding of Glu and Ca 2 � to their distinct but partially overlapping binding site...|$|R
