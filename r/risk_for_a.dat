5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevalence}} of Alzheimer's Disease in the United States {{is estimated at}} 5.1 million, and of these two thirds are women. Furthermore, women {{are far more likely}} to be the primary caregivers of adult family members with depression, so that they bear both the risks and burdens of this disease. The lifetime <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> woman of developing Alzeimer's is twice that of men. Part of this difference may be due to life expectancy, but changing hormonal status over their lifetime may also play a par as may differences in gene expression. Deaths due to dementia are higher in women than men (4.5% of deaths vs. 2.0%).|$|E

40|$|Despite {{warnings}} that drinking during pregnancy is unsafe, {{many women are}} still at <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP). This article describes the outcomes of a web-based, self-guided change intervention designed to lower the <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> AEPs in <b>a</b> community. A sample of 458 women, {{between the ages of}} 18 and 44 years and at <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> AEP (i. e., any drinking in the past 30 days and not using reliable contraception), participated in the study. A total of 58 % of the women enrolled in the self-guided change intervention were no longer at <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> AEP at the 4 -month follow-up. Sublevel analysis revealed that mail and online versions of the intervention were equally successful at reducing <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> AEP. This study represents a successful implementation of a web-based, self-guided change intervention to reduce <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> AEP, an intervention with community-wide reach due to the Internet platform...|$|R

25|$|Between 60 and 80% of TSC {{patients}} have benign tumors (once thought hamartomatous, but now considered true neoplasms) of the kidneys called angiomyolipomas frequently causing hematuria. These tumors {{are composed of}} vascular (angio–), smooth muscle (–myo–), and fat (–lip-) tissue. Although benign, an angiomyolipoma larger than 4cm is at <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> potentially catastrophic hemorrhage either spontaneously or with minimal trauma. Angiomyolipomas are found in about one in 300 people without TSC. However, those are usually solitary, whereas in TSC they are commonly multiple and bilateral.|$|E

25|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{states that}} excess sodium can {{increase}} {{blood pressure and}} the <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> heart disease and stroke in some individuals. Therefore, health authorities recommend limitations on dietary sodium. The United States Department of Health and Human Services recommends that individuals consume no more than 1500–2300mg of sodium (3750–5750mg of salt) per day depending on race, medical condition and age. The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume no more than 5 g of salt per day.|$|E
25|$|Why {{the freight}} train failed to stop was unclear. A wrong-side signal problem was eliminated, leaving human error {{as the only}} {{possible}} cause. However, since the head-end crew of the freight train did not survive, {{it was not clear}} why they had erred. Enough of their remains were found that testing was able to rule out drugs or alcohol as the cause, though it was revealed that the engineer, Jack Hudson, was an alcoholic and heavy smoker suffering from pancreatitis and type 2 diabetes, thus placing him at <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> heart attack or stroke.|$|E
25|$|Insurance {{involves}} pooling {{funds from}} many insured entities (known as exposures) {{to pay for}} the losses that some may incur. The insured entities are therefore protected from <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fee, with the fee being dependent upon the frequency and severity of the event occurring. In order to be an insurable risk, the risk insured against must meet certain characteristics. Insurance as a financial intermediary is a commercial enterprise and {{a major part of the}} financial services industry, but individual entities can also self-insure through saving money for possible future losses.|$|E

25|$|Diabetes and prediabetes are {{strongly}} linked to obesity and overweight. Nearly 50% {{of people with}} diabetes are obese, and 90% are overweight. 19 A chief risk factor for prediabetes is excess abdominal fat. Obesity increases one’s <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> variety of other medical problems, including hypertension, stroke, other forms of cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and several forms of cancer. Obese individuals are at twice the risk of dying from any cause than normal-weight individuals. The prevalence of obesity and overweight have risen to epidemic proportions in the United States, where 67% of adults are overweight and, of these, approximately half are obese.|$|E
25|$|Multiple genes collectively {{influence}} {{the likelihood of}} developing many common and complex diseases. Personalised medicine {{can also be used}} to predict a person’s <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> particular disease, based on one or even several genes. This approach uses the same sequencing technology to focus on the evaluation of disease risk, allowing the physician to initiate preventative treatment before the disease presents itself in their patient. For example, if it is found that a DNA mutation increases a person’s risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, this individual can begin lifestyle changes that will lessen their chances of developing Type 2 Diabetes later in life.|$|E
25|$|Flu spreads {{around the}} world in {{seasonal}} epidemics. Three influenza pandemics occurred in the 20th century and killed tens of millions of people, with each of these pandemics being caused by the appearance of a new strain of the virus in humans. Often, these new strains result from the spread of an existing flu virus to humans from other animal species. When it first killed humans in Asia in the 1990s, a deadly avian strain of H5N1 posed a great <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new influenza pandemic; however, this virus did not mutate to spread easily between people.|$|E

25|$|Some {{structures}} are inherently {{more or less}} {{at risk of being}} struck by lightning. The <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> structure {{is a function of the}} size (area) of a structure, the height, and the number of lightning strikes per year per mi² for the region. For example, a small building will be less likely to be struck than a large one, and a building in an area with a high density of lightning strikes will be more likely to be struck than one in an area with a low density of lightning strikes. The National Fire Protection Agency provides a risk assessment worksheet in their lightning protection standard.|$|E
25|$|Should it prove tenable, then, {{considered}} {{in conjunction with}} the advance of the Russians from the Rhine, the whole line of the river Meuse below Namur, and the communications with Aachen and the Prussian States, were secured. If, on the other hand, either position should be forced by the French, then Mont-Saint-Jean and Wavre, upon parallel lines of retreat towards Brussels and Leuven, would likewise offer the means of co-operation {{on the south side of}} the Forest of Soignies; and supposing Blücher willing to <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time his communication with the right bank of the Meuse, concentric lines of retreat upon Brussels would bring the two armies in combined position in the immediate front of that capital.|$|E
25|$|Dysgerminoma {{accounts}} for 35% {{of ovarian cancer}} in young women and {{is the most likely}} germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes; nodal metastases occur in 25–30% of cases. These tumors may have mutations in the KIT gene, a mutation known for its role in gastrointestinal stromal tumor. People with an XY karyotype and ovaries (gonadal dysgenesis) or an X,0 karyotype and ovaries (Turner syndrome) who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> gonadoblastoma in the other ovary, and in this case, both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor. Gonadoblastomas in people with Swyer or Turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40% of cases. However, in general, dysgerminomas are bilateral 10–20% of the time.|$|E
