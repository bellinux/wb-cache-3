25|$|Supercapacitors are {{suitable}} temporary energy storage devices for energy harvesting systems. In energy harvesting systems the energy is {{collected from the}} ambient or renewable sources, e.g. mechanical movement, light or electromagnetic fields, and converted to electrical energy in an energy storage device. For example, it was demonstrated that energy collected from RF (radio frequency) fields (using an RF antenna as an appropriate <b>rectifier</b> <b>circuit)</b> can be stored to a printed supercapacitor. The harvested energy was then used to power an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) circuit for over 10 hours.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the basic}} {{indicator}} system in either an analog or digital meter responds to DC only, a multimeter includes an AC to DC conversion circuit for making alternating current measurements. Basic meters utilize a <b>rectifier</b> <b>circuit</b> {{to measure the}} average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated root mean square (RMS) value for a sinusoidal waveform; this will give correct readings for alternating current as used in power distribution. User guides for some such meters give correction factors for some simple non-sinusoidal waveforms, to allow the correct root mean square (RMS) equivalent value to be calculated. More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true RMS value of the waveform within certain limits; the user manual for the meter may indicate {{the limits of the}} crest factor and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid. RMS sensing is necessary for measurements on non-sinusoidal periodic waveforms, such as found in audio signals and variable-frequency drives.|$|E

2500|$|Thermionic diode {{rectifiers}} {{were widely}} used in power supplies in vacuum tube consumer electronic products, such as phonographs, radios, and televisions, for example the All American Five radio receiver, to provide the high DC plate voltage needed by other vacuum tubes. [...] "Full-wave" [...] versions with two separate plates were popular because they could be used with a center-tapped transformer to make a full-wave rectifier. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers were made for very high voltages, such as the {{high voltage power supply}} for the cathode ray tube of television receivers, and the kenotron used for power supply in X-ray equipment. [...] However, compared to modern semiconductor diodes, vacuum tube rectifiers have high internal resistance due to space charge and therefore high voltage drops, causing high power dissipation and low efficiency. [...] They are rarely able to handle currents exceeding 250mA owing to the limits of plate power dissipation, and cannot be used for low voltage applications, [...] such as battery chargers.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the ripple factor of half-wave <b>rectifier</b> <b>circuits.</b> The ripple factor {{is one of the}} important characteristics necessary when designing a power electronic converter. The ripple factor measures how much deviation the converter output parameter has, such as the output current, from its nominal designed value. In this paper the ripple factor of the output current of half-wave rectifiers is investigated. More specifically, the ripple factor of output current from more practical half-wave rectifiers that include inductive load with or without a freewheeling diode are analyzed and then compared to that of the basic half-wave rectifier consisting only of a resistive load.

40|$|For small {{capacity}} <b>rectifier</b> <b>circuits</b> such {{as those}} for consumer electronics and appliances, capacitor input type <b>rectifier</b> <b>circuits</b> are generally used. Consequently, various harmonics generated within the power system become a serious problem. Various studies of this effect have been presented so far. However, most of these employ switching devices, such as FETs and the like. The absence of switching devices makes systems more tolerant to over-load, and brings low radio noise benefits. The author proposes a power factor correction scheme using a LC resonant in commercial frequency without switching devices. In this method, It makes a sinusoidal wave is made by widening conduction period using the current resonance. Hence, the harmonic characteristics can be significantly improved, where the lower order harmonics, such as the fifth and seventh orders are much reduced. The circuit topology can be easily applied to like dc high voltage generators. The results are confirmed by the theoretical and experimental implementations...|$|R
