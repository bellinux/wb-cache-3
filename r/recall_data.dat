The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} associations between adverse childhood experiences and binge drinking and drunkenness in adulthood using both historical and <b>recalled</b> <b>data</b> from childhood. Methods. Data on childhood adverse experiences were collected from school health records and questionnaires completed in adulthood. Adulthood data were obtained from the baseline examinations of the male participants (n = 2682) in the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD) in 1984 – 1989 from eastern Finland. School health records from the 1930 s to 1950 s were available for a subsample of KIHD men (n = 952). Results. According to the school health records, men who had adverse childhood experiences had a 1. 51 -fold (95 % CI 1. 05 to 2. 18) age- and examination-year adjusted odds of binge drinking in adulthood. After adjustment for socioeconomic position in adulthood or behavioural factors in adulthood, the association remained unchanged. Adjustment for socioeconomic position in childhood attenuated these effects.

50|$|In {{the study}} of human memory, the {{contiguity}} effect {{has been found in}} studies of free recall. Analyses of free <b>recall</b> <b>data</b> indicates that there tends to be the greatest number of +/- 1 transitions between words, suggesting that a person is more likely to recall words together that are closer together in a list. This is shown in a graph of conditional response probability as a function of lag as originated by Dr. Michael Kahana. The probability of recall (y-axis) is plotted against the lag, or separation between subsequently recalled words. For example, if two items A and B are learned together, when cued with B, A is retrieved and vice versa due to their temporal contiguity, although there will be a stronger forward association (when cued with A, B is recalled).|$|E
