5|$|Production of lead is {{increasing}} worldwide {{due to its}} use in lead–acid batteries. There are two major categories of production: primary from mined ores, and secondary from scrap. In 2014, 4.58million metric tons came from primary production and 5.64million from secondary production. The top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China, Australia, and the United States. The top three producers of refined lead were China, the United States, and South Korea. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report of 2010, {{the total amount of}} lead in use, stockpiled, discarded or dissipated into the environment, on a global basis, is 8kg per capita. Much of this is in more developed countries (20–150kg per capita) <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>less</b> developed ones (1–4kg per capita).|$|E

25|$|There have been, and {{continue}} to be, various reasons for researching non-standard BBN. The first, which is largely of historical interest, is to resolve inconsistencies between BBN predictions and observations. This {{has proved to be}} of limited usefulness in that the inconsistencies were resolved by better observations, and in most cases trying to change BBN resulted in abundances that were more inconsistent with observations <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>less.</b> The second reason for researching non-standard BBN, and largely the focus of non-standard BBN in the early 21st century, is to use BBN to place limits on unknown or speculative physics. For example, standard BBN assumes that no exotic hypothetical particles were involved in BBN. One can insert a hypothetical particle (such as a massive neutrino) and see what has to happen before BBN predicts abundances that are very different from observations. This has been done to put limits on the mass of a stable tau neutrino.|$|E

The episode was scored by Mark Lanegan, with whom Thomas had gone to elementary school. Thomas was favorable towards the scene in which Veronica and Logan discuss his past, stating that the scene could have dragged due to its length but that it did not. When scripting the scene, there was a discussion in the writers' room regarding what the extent of Veronica's jealousy could be, with Thomas and Ruggiero, who Thomas described as [...] "naturally jealous people", winning out and making Veronica more envious <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>less.</b> For the scene in which Veronica asks Keith about the report on Dean O'Dell's suicide by humorously requiring him to sing what he has found, Colantoni gave nine different musical impressions of his dialogue, [...] "I finally got the police report on the Dean's suicide!" ...|$|E

First, he argued, if the flag were nothing more than an ordinary item of property, the state could prohibit its burning merely as an exercise of its authority to protect the public safety. [...] The flag's status as a special emblem of nationality, however, entitles it to additional protections, some of which have been upheld by the Court in the past.
