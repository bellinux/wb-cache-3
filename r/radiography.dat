Neutron moisture gauges use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable neutron source for {{gold and silver}} prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground water movement. The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up (48.3%), fuel rod scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%). By 1994 most californium-252 was used in neutron <b>radiography</b> (77.4%), with fuel rod scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: With the {{increasing}} usage of X rays, professional responsibility entails dentists to have sufficient and correct knowledge about prescription of <b>radiographies</b> {{in order to}} correctly diagnose and minimally expose patients to radiation. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the awareness levels of dentists in Yazd in term of correct prescription of <b>radiographies.</b> Method: In this descriptive, cross sectional study, specially formatted questionnaires were filled by 134 dentists. Their knowledge in 10 various fields for correct prescription of <b>radiographies</b> was evaluated and compared in each field on the basis of gender and educational status. (General, specialists) Results: According to the results, knowledge levels about correct prescription of panoramic, periapical <b>radiographies,</b> CT and MRI was good, while that for occlussal <b>radiographies,</b> patients prone to caries, patients with periodontal diseases, evaluation of growth condition and dental crypts was moderate. In addition, it was weak for bitewing <b>radiographies</b> and in patients not prone to caries. There was no significant difference in awareness levels according to gender. The awareness level of specialists was much higher than that of general dentists except in cases of patients prone to caries where the difference was not significant. Conclusion: One of the most effective means for reducing probable risks of radiation is abstention from prescription of unnecessary <b>radiographies...</b>|$|R

The Caldas method was employed on the lateral cefalometric <b>radiographies</b> in order to obtain the vertebral bone age. From the information about the bone age, vertebral bone age and chronological age, the Wilcoxon test was used to compare all the ages in pairs. There was a statistically significant difference between the three ages mentioned above for both male and female control group and female Down syndrome group.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive analytical study with a quantitative approach and an emphasis on diagnosis. The training set was composed of images collected between January and July 2009 from patients who had undergone lateral-view digital <b>radiographies</b> of the lumbar spine, which were provided by a radiology clinic located in the municipality of Criciúma (SC). Out of the total of 260 images gathered, those with distortions, those presenting pathological conditions that altered the architecture of the lumbar spine and those with patterns that were difficult to characterize were discarded, resulting in 206 images. The image data base (n = 206) was then subdivided, resulting in 68 <b>radiographies</b> for the training stage, 68 images for tests and 70 for validation.

5|$|If {{the amount}} of current used exceeds the {{capability}} of the electrode, tungsten inclusions in the weld may result. Known as tungsten spitting, this can be identified with <b>radiography</b> and can be prevented by changing the type of electrode or increasing the electrode diameter. In addition, if the electrode is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes the welding arc to become unstable, requiring that the electrode be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity.|$|E
