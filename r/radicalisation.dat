5|$|The {{growth of}} the new middle class in Syria fueled discontent since the {{traditional}} elite dominated the agrarian sector – the largest {{sector of the economy}} – and created most of the wealth. The new middle class consisted of capitalists and entrepreneurs who opposed the traditional elite – the monopolisation of power by the traditional elite led to the <b>radicalisation</b> of the new middle class. The military, which in many countries is conservative and elitist, became radicalised in Syria because the military wanted greater power, believing that the traditional elite were unable to defend the country. A significant group of military personnel were recruited from the new middle class or from the hinterlands.|$|E
25|$|The International grew {{substantially}} in the 1960s, alongside most other left-wing groups. The April 1969 Ninth World Congress in Italy gathered 100 delegates and observers from 30 countries including new sections in Ireland, Luxembourg and Sweden and rebuilt ones in France, Mexico, Spain and Switzerland. It adopted a major resolution on the deepening youth <b>radicalisation.</b> Over {{the following years}} its sections continued to grow principally through campaigns {{in opposition to the}} war in Vietnam, though the student and youth <b>radicalisation.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Begg {{was interviewed}} {{in the video}} 21st Century CrUSAders, saying that the War on Terrorism is really akin to a war against Islam. According to Gareth Peirce, {{possession}} of this film has been offered in British courts as evidence of <b>radicalisation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{aftermath}} of the Hamilton game, followed by the bloody batoning of marchers in Wellington's Molesworth Street in the following week, in which police batoned bare-headed protesters, led to the <b>radicalisation</b> of the protest movement. Because of this, many protesters began to wear motorcycle or bicycle helmets {{to protect themselves from}} batons and head injury.|$|E
25|$|Gemmell was a {{civil servant}} in the UK's Home Office and Cabinet Office (2002 - 2007). Gemmell was Private Secretary to Permanent Secretary Sir John Gieve (2003 - 2005), Assistant Director {{responsible}} for economic migration (2005 - 2006) and counter <b>radicalisation</b> advisor in the Cabinet Office Defence and Overseas Secretariat (2006 - 2007) headed by Sir Nigel Sheinwald.|$|E
25|$|The book The Islamist by Ed Husain, {{reveals the}} inner {{workings}} of the political organization. It follows the path of a young man coming to terms with his extremist/Islamist mindset. He describes how violence and the increasing <b>radicalisation</b> of the group eventually lead to him cutting all ties and resigning from the head of the local group at Tower Hamlets University.|$|E
25|$|At the Eighth World Congress, {{held in the}} Taunus Mountains in Germany during December 1965, Samarakkody {{was also}} the {{delegate}} of a new section in Ceylon, the LSSP (R), formed by an 'orthodox' tendency in the LSSP. Sixty delegates attended the congress, which witnessed a growth from an international <b>radicalisation</b> of students and youth. The main resolution on The International Situation and the Tasks of Revolutionary Marxists focussed the sections on solidarity for anti-imperialist struggles, such as that in Vietnam, and intervening into the youth <b>radicalisation</b> and the crisis in international Communism. Other major resolutions were adopted on Africa, Western Europe and the deepening Sino-Soviet split. That congress recognised two sympathising groups in Britain. One, the Revolutionary Socialist League, {{better known as the}} Militant tendency, objected to what it regarded as the uncritical way in which the International supported anti-colonial liberation movements and regarded the International's decision to give official recognition to a second, rival, group as undemocratic. Its views had deep roots, and the RSL left the International soon after, leaving the International Group as the British section.|$|E
25|$|After his turnaround, Nawaz co-founded Quilliam {{with former}} Islamists, {{including}} Ed Husain. He wrote an autobiography, , {{which was published}} in 2012. Since then, he has become a prominent critic of Islamism in the United Kingdom. He is a regular op-ed contributor, debater and public commenter. He presented his views on <b>radicalisation</b> in front of US Senate Committee and UK Home Affairs Committee in their respective inquiries on the roots of radical extremism.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} CTU's role {{in working}} with the community, its {{structure}} includes a Prevent Team which {{is a group of}} officers who visit schools, community groups and partner agencies to raise awareness about the work on the unit.

25|$|Following the Second Partition of Poland of 1793, the {{presence}} of Prussian and Imperial Russian garrisons on Polish soil was almost continuous. The foreign occupation forces contributed both to the economic collapse of the already-weakened state and to the growing <b>radicalisation</b> {{of the population of}} Warsaw. Foreign influence at the Polish court, often embodied by Russian ambassador Nikolai Repnin, had been strong for many years; during the partitions of Poland it started to influence the Polish government and szlachta (nobility), and the entire people.|$|E
25|$|In November 2015 in the {{aftermath}} of the Paris attacks, French authorities for the first time closed three mosques with extremist activities and <b>radicalisation</b> being given as the reason. The mosques were located in Lagny-sur-Marne, Lyon and Gennevilliers. Muslim community leaders widely condemned the Paris attacks in public statements and expressed their support for the French government's attempts to oppose islamist extremism. In 2016 French authorities reported that 120 of the 2500 Islamic prayer halls were disseminating salafist ideas and 20 mosques were closed due to findings of hate speech.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{resumption}} of peace in Europe, the price of milk fell dramatically affecting company profits. On top of that, the War of Independence led to considerable damage being inflicted {{on many of the}} company's factories and creameries. Some of this damage was caused by Crown forces, despite the Cleeves being staunch Unionists. Other instances were seemingly the work of Irish Nationalists who saw the Condensed Milk Company as a symbol of British rule. The third challenge faced by the company lay in the <b>radicalisation</b> of sections of its workforce.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1780s, radicalism in Ireland {{was taking}} a new, bolder form, typified by the letters penned by William Drennan which were {{published}} in the Belfast Newsletter and in pamphlets. In them he hit out at leaders of the Volunteers such as Grattan and Charlemont for their conservatism and restraint, and at the political establishment for preventing the reform of the Irish parliament. Most notably was his appeal for all Anglicans, Dissenters, and Roman Catholics to unite as one indifferent association, however he accepted that this would only appeal to the minority within each denomination. Inspiring and increasing the <b>radicalisation</b> of Irish reformists was the French Revolution which had started in 1789, and had so far remained largely bloodless, with the French king forced to concede effective power to a National Assembly.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} for the Daily Mail, Nawaz notes how self-segregation has created Muslim {{communities}} in London where third-generation teenagers are growing up without having any non-Muslim friends, or friends from the opposite sex. He notes how their lives revolve around faith schools, mosque, Islamic extracurricular activities and cultural events involving members of the Muslim community only. Without any exposure to the complexities of modern life, he argues, such teens are susceptible to simplistic worldviews and dogma. On an individual level, Nawaz maps a person's path to <b>radicalisation</b> with four key stages: grievances, identity crisis, charismatic recruiter and ideology. It begins {{with a sense of}} real or perceived grievances, which leads to an identity crisis. This condition is then capitalised on by a recruiter from an organisation who lays out the ideology as a solution to that individual's alienation.|$|E
25|$|The {{nationalist}} leader John Redmond pledged {{support for}} the British war effort and many Irishmen served in the British Army (see Ireland and World War I), but {{the war and the}} frustration of nationalist ambitions regarding Home Rule led to a <b>radicalisation</b> of Irish nationalism. In 1916, a group of IRB activists within the Irish Volunteers led an insurrection aimed at Irish independence in Dublin, known as the Easter Rising. The rebellion did not have popular support and was put down within a week, but the execution of its leaders, and the subsequent wholesale arrest of radical nationalist activists proved very unpopular with the nationalist public. Coming directly after the Rising, a further attempt was made at the Irish Convention to resolve the impasse over Home Rule, but without success. Finally, the British proposal to extend conscription for the war to Ireland provoked widespread resistance, (see Conscription Crisis of 1918) and discredited the Irish Parliamentary Party who had supported the British war effort.|$|E
25|$|The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), proscribed by the {{government}} as a terrorist organisation, has targeted Australian Muslims for recruitment. Making use of social media, recruiters target those vulnerable to <b>radicalisation,</b> and encourage local jihad activities. Some of those targeted have been minors, including a teenager who was arrested in Melbourne in May 2015 for plotting to detonate home-made bombs. In June 2014, {{the government}} claimed that roughly 150 Australians had been recruited {{to fight in the}} conflicts in Syria and Iraq. A list released in April 2015 showed that most were young males who have come from a range of occupations, including students. It was also reported at the time that 20 Australians had been killed fighting overseas for terror groups, with 249 suspected jihadists prevented from leaving Australia. The Border Force Counter-Terrorism Unit, tasked with stopping jihadists from leaving the country, had cancelled more than 100 passports by the end of March 2015. Several jihadists have expressed the desire to return to Australia, but Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said that any who do would be prosecuted on their arrival.|$|E
25|$|When {{membership}} and activity {{was at a}} peak in the period after the Second World War, renowned Party speaker Tony Turner began giving lectures for the Party on what socialism would be like. The content of these lectures led him to develop a position that caused enormous controversy in the Party by the early to mid-1950s and which was elaborated by Turner and his supporters in articles in the Party's internal discussion journal of the time, Forum. A series of acrimonious disputes between the ‘Turnerites’ {{and the majority of}} the Party culminated in a Party referendum and then a resolution being carried at the 1955 Party Conference to the effect that all members not in agreement with the Declaration of Principles be asked to resign. Turner, having survived a previous attempt to expel him, promptly did so, along with a number of other members including Joan Lestor (later to become a Labour minister) and the psychologist John Rowan. Some of these ex-members formed a short-lived Movement for Social Integration, though, ironically enough, the impact the dispute had on the Party as a whole was almost entirely disruptive and negative. Indeed, it didn’t recover its vitality for some years, until the wave of <b>radicalisation</b> that grew up in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|A {{legacy of}} Sufi {{activity}} {{may be found}} in some Pashtun regions, especially in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa area, as evident in songs and dances. Many Pashtuns are prominent Ulema, Islamic scholars, such as Muhammad Muhsin Khan who has helped translate the Noble Quran, Sahih Al-Bukhari and many other books to the English language. Jamal-al-Din al-Afghani was a 19th-century Islamic ideologist and {{one of the founders of}} Islamic modernism. Although his ethnicity is disputed by some, he is widely accepted in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region as well as in the Arab world, as a Pashtun from the Kunar Province of Afghanistan. Like other non Arabic-speaking Muslims, many Pashtuns are able to read the Quran but not understand the Arabic language implicit in the holy text itself. Translations, especially in English, are scarcely far and in between understood or distributed. This paradox has contributed to the spread of different versions of religious practices and Wahabism, as well as political Islamism (including movements such as the Taliban) having a key presence in Pashtun society. In order to counter <b>radicalisation</b> and fundamentalism, the United States began spreading its influence in Pashtun areas. Many Pashtuns want to reclaim their identity from being lumped in with the Taliban and international terrorism, which is not directly linked with Pashtun culture and history.|$|E
25|$|However, it was {{not until}} the 1960s that the Syrian Brotherhood came to play a major role in politics, as part of a broad-based {{resistance}} movement, which developed into armed struggle, against the secular government. After the secular Ba'athist military coup of 8 March 1963, the new administration drastically restricted political freedoms, and concentrated power in the hands of the military and awarded prominent positions to the country's Alawite minority. Sunni Syrian Islamists – from the majority faith – did not have representation in the government. From the start, Islamic political groups, of which the Brotherhood was the most prominent, represented the strongest opposition to the government. The outlawing of Brotherhood in 1964 resulted in its <b>radicalisation.</b> In 1964 and 1965, strikes and mass demonstrations spread throughout Syria's major cities, especially in Hama, and were crushed by the military. In 1971, General Hafez al-Assad, an Alawite, seized power; in 1973 violent demonstrations broke out again in response to a proposed constitution that did not require the president to be a Muslim. Syria's intervention in the Lebanese civil war in 1976 on the side of the Maronites sparked renewed agitation in Syria, and assassinations began to target members of the Syrian government and prominent Alawites; the Muslim Brotherhood later claimed responsibility for most of these.|$|E
25|$|The {{politics}} of the period inevitably drove France towards war with Austria and its allies. The King, many of the Feuillants, and the Girondins specifically wanted to wage war. The King (and many Feuillants with him) expected war would increase his personal popularity; he also foresaw an opportunity to exploit any defeat: either result would make him stronger. The Girondins wanted to export the Revolution throughout Europe and, by extension, to defend the Revolution within France. The forces opposing war were much weaker. Barnave and his supporters among the Feuillants feared a war they thought France had little chance to win and which they feared might lead to greater <b>radicalisation</b> of the revolution. On {{the other end of}} the political spectrum Robespierre opposed a war on two grounds, fearing that it would strengthen the monarchy and military at the expense of the revolution, and that it would incur the anger of ordinary people in Austria and elsewhere. The Austrian emperor Leopold II, brother of Marie Antoinette, may have wished to avoid war, but he died on 1 March 1792. France preemptively declared war on Austria (20 April 1792) and Prussia joined on the Austrian side a few weeks later. The invading Prussian army faced little resistance until checked at the Battle of Valmy (20 September 1792) and was forced to withdraw.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to Constantinople, Khrimian delivered {{a series of}} speeches [...] "which secured him {{a place in the}} <b>radicalisation</b> of Armenian thinking, and the clear and forceful articulation of demands based on nationalist principles." [...] He gave a well-known sermon in which he called for the armament of the Armenians in order to fight for an independent Armenia. He told his flock that [...] "Armenia, in contrast with the Christian states of the Balkans, did not win autonomy from the Porte because no Armenian blood had been shed in the cause of freedom." [...] Famous for its allegories, the sermon is considered to have initiated the Armenian revolutionary movement.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Blackett also {{restricted}} {{public access}} to the evidence used at the trial, releasing on 8 November stills, audio clips and transcripts from the serviceman's video that was played to the court-martial board, but ruling that the full video itself not be released, since doing so [...] "would increase the threat of harm to British service personnel." [...] On 5 December 2013, the Court Martial Appeal Court upheld the earlier decisions prohibiting {{the release of the}} video footage of the attack and some of the stills from it. The Court stated, however, that the prohibition was to prevent the material being used for <b>radicalisation,</b> rather than it posing a risk {{to the life of the}} defendants.|$|E
500|$|Lenin's {{mother was}} {{concerned}} by her son's <b>radicalisation,</b> and {{was instrumental in}} convincing the Interior Ministry {{to allow him to}} return to the city of Kazan, but not the university. On his return, he joined Nikolai Fedoseev's revolutionary circle, through which he discovered Karl Marx's 1867 book [...] This sparked his interest in Marxism, a socio-political theory that argued that society developed in stages, that this development resulted from class struggle, and that capitalist society would ultimately give way to socialist society and then communist society. Wary of his political views, Lenin's mother bought a country estate in Alakaevka village, Samara Oblast, in the hope that her son would turn his attention to agriculture. He had little interest in farm management, and his mother soon sold the land, keeping the house as a summer home.|$|E
500|$|Amid the War on Terror {{and threat}} from Al Qaeda, Livingstone sought to build closer {{ties to the}} London's Muslim community, {{controversially}} agreeing to meet with Islamist groups like the Muslim Association of Britain alongside moderate organisations. In July 2004, he attended a conference discussing France's ban on the burka at which he talked alongside Islamist cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi. Livingstone described al-Qaradawi as [...] "one of the most authoritative Muslim scholars in the world today" [...] and argued that his influence could help stop the <b>radicalisation</b> of young British Muslims. The move was controversial, with Jewish and LGBT organisations criticising Livingstone, citing al-Qaradawi's record of anti-Semitic and homophobic remarks, with the meeting leading to a publicised argument between Livingstone and his former supporter Peter Tatchell. Livingstone continued to champion the Palestinian cause in the Israel-Palestine conflict, in March 2005 accusing Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of being a [...] "war criminal" [...] responsible for the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre.|$|E
500|$|For the 1981 presidential election, both Le Pen and Pascal Gauchon of the PFN {{declared}} {{their intentions}} to run. However, an increased requirement on support by elected officials {{had been introduced}} for the election, which left both Le Pen and Gauchon unable to stand for the election. (In France, parties have to secure support from a specific number of elected officials, from a specific number of departments, {{in order to be}} eligible to run for election. In 1976, the number of required elected officials was increased fivefold, and the number of departments threefold.) The election was won by François Mitterrand of the Socialist Party (PS), which gave the political left national power {{for the first time in}} the Fifth Republic; he then dissolved the National Assembly to call a snap legislative election. The PS attained its best ever result with an absolute majority in the 1981 legislative election. This [...] "socialist takeover" [...] led to a <b>radicalisation</b> in centre-right, anti-communist, and anti-socialist voters. With only three weeks to prepare its campaign, the FN fielded only a limited number of candidates and won only 0.2% of the national vote. The PFN was even worse off, and the election marked the effective end of competition from the party.|$|E
500|$|Though {{he never}} adhered to Christianity in his {{adolescent}} or adult life, Koht valued {{the faith in}} the perfectability of human beings, as prompted [...] "the greatest religions", {{and he started to}} feel solidarity with the labour movement and the working classes, leading to the <b>radicalisation</b> of his views: from 1900 he voted for the Norwegian Labour Party, and had four years prior to that began to consider himself a socialist. While living in the United States, he developed a form of historical materialism, which led to a fusion of history scholarship and political views. He viewed the Liberal Party as an important agent in Norwegian history, since it pronounced the rights of the farmers, but he now viewed the working class as the next class {{to be included in the}} political life, and specifically through the Labor Party. In Koht's Liberal Party period, he cooperated with some of their more radical members, among them Carl Jeppesen, who later would join the Labour Party. He joined the Labour Party when he returned from the United States and moved to Bærum in 1909. He lived with his family in Stabekk, but commissioned a house in Lysaker in 1910. The house, designed by architect Arnstein Arneberg, was dubbed [...] "Karistua". The university offered him no office, so he had to conduct his research at home.|$|E
2500|$|HT {{points out}} that the British government, in a {{classified}} report, discounted the conveyor belt theory, stating [...] "We do not believe that it is accurate to regard <b>radicalisation</b> in this country as a linear 'conveyor belt' moving from grievance, through <b>radicalisation,</b> to violence … This thesis seems to both misread the <b>radicalisation</b> process and to give undue weight to ideological factors." [...] (In reply conservative columnist Andrew Giligan writes: [...] "In fact, at least 19 terrorists convicted in Britain have had links with al-Muhajiroun, including Omar Khayam, sentenced to life imprisonment as leader of the “fertiliser bomb” plot, and Abdullah Ahmed Ali, the ringleader of the airliner “liquid bomb” plot, who is also serving life.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Anjem Choudary {{refused to}} condemn the attack. He said, [...] "I'm not in the {{business}} of condemnation or condoning. I think if anyone needs to be condemned it is the British government and their foreign policy. It's so clear that that is the cause." [...] On BBC's Newsnight, when Choudary was questioned about his role in the <b>radicalisation</b> of Michael Adebolajo, he denied any responsibility, and talked about such <b>radicalisation</b> as a means to an end. He stated that he believed that not many Muslims would disagree with what Adebolajo had said in his videoed statement.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to one of}} its co-founders, Maajid Nawaz, [...] "We wish {{to raise}} [...] Islamism"; he also said, [...] "I want to {{demonstrate}} how the Islamist ideology is incompatible with Islam.

2500|$|A 2015 [...] "general portrait" [...] by Olivier Roy (see above) of [...] "the {{conditions}} and circumstances" [...] {{under which people}} living in France become [...] "Islamic radicals" [...] (terrorists or would-be terrorists) found <b>radicalisation</b> was not an [...] "uprising of a Muslim community that is victim to poverty and racism: only young people join, including converts". Or as another observer described it: ...|$|E
2500|$|The UK {{government}} {{established a}} task force to look at ways of stemming the growth of Islamic extremism in Britain, focusing on the <b>radicalisation</b> of worshippers in mosques, university students and prisoners. The task force – chaired by David Cameron – had its inaugural meeting at 10 Downing Street on 3 June 2013, and includes Cabinet Ministers, and representatives from the police and intelligence services. Later that day Cameron made a House of Commons statement on the Woolwich attack, saying that lessons must be learned. [...] "When young men born and bred in this country are radicalised and turned into killers, we have to ask some tough questions about what is happening in our country. It is as if that for some young people there is a conveyor belt to <b>radicalisation</b> that has poisoned their minds with sick and perverted ideas. We need to dismantle this process at every stage – in schools, colleges, universities, on the internet, in our prisons, wherever it is taking place." ...|$|E
2500|$|... ar {{from being}} {{religious}} zealots, {{a large number}} of those involved in terrorism do not practise their faith regularly. Many lack religious literacy and could actually be regarded as religious novices. Very few have been brought up in strongly religious households, and there is a higher than average proportion of converts. Some are involved in drug-taking, drinking alcohol and visiting prostitutes. MI5 says there is evidence that a well-established religious identity actually protects against violent <b>radicalisation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{decline of}} the Nasserist regime {{signified}} another era in the feminist movement in Egypt. In 1972 {{the publication of the}} book Women and Sex by Nawal El Saadawi was symbolic of the re-emergence and <b>radicalisation</b> of the movement. The book demanded [...] "unified criteria for 'honor' for both women and men, and denounced social practices which used religion to justify women's oppression". The book caused a strong backlash within Egyptian society especially due to the rising religious fundamentalism within the state.|$|E
2500|$|Riipinen {{was elected}} to the Parliament of Finland in the 1930 {{parliamentary}} election from the National Coalition Party electoral list. Her relations within the party became strained as she was straightforward and did not prefer to compromise. She {{was one of the few}} in her parliamentary group who supported the shift towards <b>radicalisation</b> in the Lapua Movement. For this reason, Lapua supporters said: [...] "There is only one man in the parliament, and that one happens to be a woman".|$|E
2500|$|Prime Minister Theresa May {{returned}} to Downing Street from campaigning {{for the upcoming}} snap general election. May, {{on the morning after}} the attack, said the incident was being treated as terrorism, and that the recent terror attacks in the UK are [...] "bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamist extremism" [...] which [...] "is a perversion of Islam". As part of a four-point plan to tackle terrorism, she called for tighter internet regulations to [...] "deprive the extremists of their safe spaces online", saying that technology firms were not currently doing enough. May's stance {{on the role of the}} internet and social media in enabling <b>radicalisation</b> was criticised by the Open Rights Group and the International Centre for the Study of <b>Radicalisation</b> and Political Violence. May was also criticised for using the speech to detail policy measures to respond to the terror threat, which some saw as contrary to her pledge to pause campaigning out of respect for the victims. May said a review would be carried out by the police and intelligence agencies to establish whether the attack could have been prevented, and on 28 June Home Secretary Amber Rudd commissioned David Anderson QC to provide independent assurance of the review work.|$|E
