For permutation optimization, only <b>real</b> <b>valued</b> probability distributions have been applied to a <b>real</b> <b>valued</b> encoding of permutations. In this paper, we present two approaches to estimating marginal product factorized probability distributions {{in the space of}} permutations directly. The estimated probability distribution is used to identify crossover positions in a <b>real</b> <b>valued</b> encoding of permutations. The resulting evolutionary algorithm (EA) is capable of more efficient scalable optimization of deceptive permutation problems of a bounded order of difficulty than when <b>real</b> <b>valued</b> probability distributions are used. ...|$|R

The application of standard estimators in general results in complex valued estimates of the <b>real</b> <b>valued</b> parameter vector. To avoid this systematic error, widely linear classical estimators that produce <b>real</b> <b>valued</b> estimates are investigated. One of these estimators is the widely linear least squares (WLLS) estimator proposed in this work, which does not utilize any noise statistics. Further, we introduce the best widely linear unbiased estimator (BWLUE) for <b>real</b> <b>valued</b> parameter vectors. The proposed estimators in general outperform their standard counterparts LS estimator and BWLUE, respectively, and they only require half as many complex valued measurements. We compare the novel approaches to standard classical estimators in two application scenarios. One of these applications considers the estimation of a <b>real</b> <b>valued</b> impulse response based on noisy measurements of the system's magnitude and phase response. For this problem, we propose a novel two-step approach based on the introduced widely linear concepts that outperforms standard estimators...|$|R

We aim to {{regularize}} measurement {{values in}} three-dimensional (3 D) computed tomography (CT) reconstructed images for higher-precision 3 D analysis, focusing on length-based 3 D cephalometric examinations. Methods. We measure the linear distances between points on different skull models using Vernier calipers (<b>real</b> <b>values).</b> We use 10 differently tilted CT scans for 3 D CT {{reconstruction of the}} models and measure the same linear distances from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). In both cases, each measurement is performed three times by three doctors, yielding nine measurements. The <b>real</b> <b>values</b> are compared with the PACS values. Each PACS measurement is revised based on the display field of view (DFOV) values and compared with the <b>real</b> <b>values.</b> Results. The <b>real</b> <b>values</b> and the PACS measurement changes according to tilt value have no significant correlations (p> 0. 05). However, significant correlations appear between the <b>real</b> <b>values</b> and DFOV-adjusted PACS measurements (p< 0. 001). Hence, we obtain a correlation expression that can yield <b>real</b> physical <b>values</b> from PACS measurements. The DFOV value intervals for various age groups are also verified. Conclusion.
