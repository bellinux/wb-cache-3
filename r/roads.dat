5|$|During World War II, the Main <b>Roads</b> Department focused its {{activities}} on the war effort. <b>Roads</b> in rural areas deteriorated, especially after the Pearl Harbour attack brought the war to the Pacific, and only the most urgent maintenance works were authorised on <b>roads</b> for civilian purposes. Following the war, Main <b>Roads</b> returned to its usual operations, repairing and maintaining the road network. The rural road network expanded in the 1950s, with Main <b>Roads</b> both repairing the worst segments of its <b>roads,</b> through numerous small jobs, and assisting local governments to seal their <b>roads.</b> Such activity was spurred on by the closure of railway lines {{in addition to the}} establishment of new land settlements.|$|E

5|$|A {{network of}} <b>roads</b> {{developed}} in the Lowlands in this period. Drover's <b>roads,</b> between the Highlands and north-east England, had become established {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century and a series of military <b>roads</b> were built and maintained as a response to the Jacobite Risings in the eighteenth century. At the beginning of the period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, but a system of land ownership based on large estates emerged. This was the beginning of a process that would create a landscape of rectangular fields and carefully located farm complexes with interconnecting <b>roads.</b> There was an attempt improve agriculture, resulting in new crops, techniques and enclosures began to displace the run rig system and free pasture.|$|E

5|$|An {{official}} inspection in October 1950 {{reported that it}} would not be difficult to improve the old road into a reasonable track, which would then have a better chance of attracting assistance from Main <b>Roads.</b> The Mandurah Road Board spent £1200 on the road, while the Harvey Road Board requested a £500 grant from Main <b>Roads</b> for their portion of the road. Two years later little progress had been made, and Main <b>Roads</b> therefore refused to fund feeder <b>roads</b> to connect to Old Coast Road. By May 1952, works had halted as Main <b>Roads</b> believed that the existing, winding route around the estuary was too prone to flooding. Settlers in the area recalled it never flooding previously, and the Mandurah Road Board was concerned that should a new road be built, they would still have to maintain the old road for access to properties. The road was inspected by the Premier, Deputy-Commissioner of Main <b>Roads</b> J. D. Leach, and the district engineer H. A. Smith. They indicated that a new road would likely closely follow the old road, but that a detailed survey would be needed. Nearby limestone deposits would be suitable for the road's foundation, with the cost estimated at £11 per chain.|$|E
5|$|Another {{significant}} human {{impact is}} roadkill—dead turtles, especially females, are commonly seen on summer <b>roads.</b> In addition to direct killing, <b>roads</b> genetically isolate some populations.
