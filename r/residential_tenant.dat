40|$|The {{past half}} century has seen {{sweeping}} changes to the legal regime applicable to the landlord-tenant relationship, particularly for residential properties. The ancient feudal conception of a lease as a present transfer of an interest in land {{has given way to}} a more modem understanding of leases as contracts between a provider of a package of goods and services and their consumer. Among the changes wrought by this conceptual shift has been the imposition of previously unknown obligations on landlords in the event of tenant abandonment. Called either the duty to mitigate or, perhaps more accurately, the avoidable consequences rule, the rule requires a landlord seeking recovery of damages from a defaulting tenant who has abandoned possession to establish that he has made reasonable efforts to minimize the damages flowing from the tenant 2 ̆ 7 s abandonment. This is a departure from the traditional rule that a landlord could, if he chose, allow property abandoned by a tenant during the term of a lease to sit vacant and idle, and still hold the tenant liable for the full rent due under the lease for the entire term thereof. A recent survey reports that the District of Columbia and all but six states have adopted this rule by statute or judicial decision in the four decades since it first entered the American legal landscape. New York has been a studied exception to this trend. For decades, the lower courts in the state have variously imposed and rejected the landlord 2 ̆ 7 s duty to mitigate, at least in the context of residential leases. This unsettled situation came to an apparent end in the summer of 2008, when the Appellate Division, Second Department, of the New York Supreme Court handed down its decision in the case of Rios v. Carrillo. That case sided with those lower courts that had held that residential landlords have no duty to mitigate, and in so doing, effectively imposed the traditional no-mitigation rule statewide for the foreseeable future. This Article argues that the Rios decision is worthy of criticism, but not because imposing a duty to mitigate on landlords is necessarily the best rule for every dispute arising out of a <b>residential</b> <b>tenant</b> 2 ̆ 7 s abandonment. Rather, Rios is bad law because it is the product of an unfortunate confluence of a poorly framed legal issue, a poorly organized judicial hierarchy, and an economically diverse jurisdiction. Rather than argue the merits of the traditional or modem positions on the legal question of landlord mitigation in the abstract, this Article argues that courts in New York have traditionally responded to <b>residential</b> <b>tenant</b> abandonment by weighing the equities and the good faith of the parties in each case, and that they should continue to do so. Rios forecloses this type of factually sensitive inquiry on the part of trial courts, creating incentives for undesirable strategic behavior by landlords. This Article proceeds as follows: Part I analyzes the cases in this area of landlord-tenant law and identifies trends in the doctrine leading up to the decision in Rios—chief among them a sensitivity of courts to the particular equities of the parties before them—and situates Rios as a natural result of these trends. Part II discusses the features of the New York Unified Court System that allow Rios, while consistent with pre-existing trends in the case law, to upend those trends and eliminate the equitable sensitivity that has characterized <b>residential</b> <b>tenant</b> abandonment cases in New York. Part III demonstrates the likely effects of this shift in the law by reference to demographic data on housing characteristics in the downstate region. Part IV concludes with a critique of Rios, not simply as a wrongly decided case, but {{as an example of how}} things can go wrong in a common-law system of adjudication...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} section 226 -b of the New York Real Property law, {{enacted by the}} New York State Legislature in 1975. Enacted to give tenants in a dwelling having four or more residential units the right to sublease or assign their apartments, subject to the landlord 2 ̆ 7 s consent, it provides that the landlord must release the tenant from the lease if (s) he 2 ̆ 2 unreasonably withholds consent for such sublease or assignment. 2 ̆ 2 The section thus gives tenants {{the right to remain}} in occupancy or to elect to be released from their leasehold obligations. However, some courts have interpreted this section to confer upon tenants a broad statutory right to sublease their apartments upon compliance with the statute 2 ̆ 7 s procedural notification requirements and the landlord 2 ̆ 7 s unreasonable withholding of consent. This Note discusses the legislative intent of section 226 -b, specifically addressing whether it gives a <b>residential</b> <b>tenant</b> the right to execute a valid sublease without the landlord 2 ̆ 7 s consent if s/he complies with the statute 2 ̆ 7 s requirements. It analyzes the right to sublease under common law as compared to the statutory right to sublease under section 226 -b, and contends that the tenant has the statutory remedies of terminating or remaining in occupancy, but not of subleasing without landlord approval...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{outlines}} the arguments {{to be made}} on behalf of <b>residential</b> <b>tenants</b> who display political signs and who encounter threats of eviction, rent increases, and other forms of landlord opposition. In Section II, the Article describes the development of the general principles of constitutional law applicable to disputes between property owners and tenants who wish to use the property owners’ premises as a forum for the expression of the tenants’ ideas and beliefs. Tracing the history of the United States Supreme Court rulings in this area, the authors analyze the waxing and waning of first amendment speech rights, the development of property-based first amendment speech rights, and the recognition of state constitutional free speech rights that are broader than their first amendment counterparts. Section III analyzes the application of freedom of speech principles to disputes between landlords and <b>residential</b> <b>tenants,</b> when the tenants wish to display political signs on the leased property. Section III also presents and analyzes the arguments frequently relied upon by landlords. For the benefit of those tenants residing in states where state constitutional free speech rights have not been liberally construed, the authors discuss the common law property rights of tenants, citing reasons why those rights are superior to the property rights of landlords in the context of disputes over tenant political expression. Finally, in Section IV, the Article concludes with an assessment of the public policy justifications for refusing to enforce contractual waivers (such as rule 13 of the lease in Paulsen v. Seamark) of a tenant’s right to freedom of political expression...|$|R
40|$|The {{world is}} going through a rapid {{development}} of Internet and network-related technologies. The Swedish government's vision is, for example, that all private persons, firms and organisations have broadband in the speed of five megabit per second before 2005. Such developments mean that the market for the construction industry will expand. Most large and medium size contractors in Sweden work with drawing cables for broadband. Most companies in real estate offer or plan to offer broadband services to their tenants. The trend is that the technologies and the suppliers drive the development of broadband, not customers and the customers' needs. In this paper a global scanning of current and future services, delivered by broadband, which can be used in computer networks of the type local community system (LCS) developed by NCC and Ericsson is presented. Twenty-eight types of services are identified and are categorised in five major groups; information services, communication services, entertainment services, e-commerce services and telemetry services. In collaboration with NCC customers' needs on broadband services were investigated in a case study, Sundby Park. A questionnaire based on the types of services identified was sent to 144 <b>residential</b> <b>tenants</b> and 42 commercial tenants in the area. The study indicates that <b>residential</b> <b>tenants</b> are most interested in information services while commercial tenants are most interested in communication services. In total, the interest for broadband services is lower than expected. The reason could either be that the industries overestimate the tenants needs for broadband services or that the respondents do not have enough knowledge yet to fully understand the services.
