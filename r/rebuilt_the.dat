5|$|Fortifications {{and other}} {{structures}} {{were built in}} the rural villages under Zahir's control. In Deir Hanna, Zahir's brother Sa'd built a large fortress and an adjacent mosque, both of which were severely damaged during a siege by Jazzar Pasha in 1776. In Khirbat Jiddin, he <b>rebuilt</b> <b>the</b> demolished Crusader fortress {{with the addition of a}} mosque and hamaam (bathhouse). The mosque was destroyed by Israeli forces when the village was captured during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. In Shefa-'Amr, Zahir's son Uthman built a large fortress with four towers, of which one remains standing. Another of his sons, Ahmad, <b>rebuilt</b> <b>the</b> Crusader fortress in Saffuriya.|$|E

McLeod was able to address issues that she had with herself and others, which she attributed to helping re-build her confidence.|$|E

5|$|Although the Rivière des Prairies is {{much smaller}} than the Saint Lawrence, bridge {{construction}} there did not begin until the 1840s—when rapid construction began on three wooden toll bridges to what is now Laval, one of which, Pont des Saints-Anges, collapsed in the 1880s and was never <b>rebuilt.</b> <b>The</b> existence of regular ferry services across the river is attested from 1813, but these ferries were discontinued when the bridges opened. The first railroad across the river was opened in 1876, and the Bordeaux Railway Bridge is the oldest fixed link to Laval that is still standing. (Another bridge across Rivière des Mille Îles, which was part of the same line, collapsed in 1882 but was immediately <b>rebuilt.)</b> <b>The</b> highway construction boom of the 1960s and 1970s led to the construction of four new freeway bridges across the river, and the upgrading of the existing Pie IX Bridge to freeway standards.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{returned}} to Poland on 20 October 1584 {{and settled in}} Miechów. He <b>rebuilt</b> <b>the</b> altar in the monastery and introduced new ceremonies (including a 40-hour prayer for the king and the kingdom). He was installed as coadjutor bishop at the see of the Bishopric of Warmia, Lidzbark Warmiński, in early July 1585. He visited the nearby major towns, including Gdańsk and Malbork.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{fell for}} a duck, and Morris and Bradman <b>rebuilt</b> <b>the</b> innings, slowly taking the score to 87 before Bradman was caught {{for the third}} {{consecutive}} time by Hutton in the leg trap off Bedser. In the meantime, Morris, after a slow start, made 105 runs {{out of a total of}} 166 scored while he was at the wicket, including 14 fours and one six. His innings was noted for powerful, well-placed cover drives. His dismissal left Australia at 166/3, quickly followed by Miller, left Australia at 173/4. Hassett and Brown <b>rebuilt</b> <b>the</b> innings slowly, taking more than three and half minutes on average for each run. Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley removed him and Brown in the space of nine runs to leave Australia 225/6. Johnson fell soon after and England were well placed when Australia ended the day on 258/7.|$|E

5|$|The C {{station was}} {{designed}} by Thomas Phillips Figgis in a similar style to Kennington station. It was partially <b>rebuilt</b> in <b>the</b> 1920s when the C tunnels were modernised, and was <b>rebuilt</b> during <b>the</b> construction of the Elephant & Castle shopping centre and roundabout in the 1960s. It was <b>rebuilt</b> at <b>the</b> start of the 21st century, reopening on 12 December 2003.|$|R
50|$|Seven {{existing}} second-rates were <b>rebuilt</b> to <b>the</b> 1706 Establishment, {{including three}} whose reconstruction was ordered in 1704-1705. These first three were the Marlborough of 1706 (<b>rebuilt</b> from <b>the</b> old Saint Michael), Blenheim of 1709 (<b>rebuilt</b> from <b>the</b> old Duchess) and the Vanguard of 1710. The other four ships were the Neptune of 1710, Ossory of 1711, Sandwich of 1715 and Barfleur of 1716.|$|R
5|$|Barnes's injury left Australia {{with only}} Morris as a {{specialist}} opener. Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener, but made only one, and Bradman fell for seven to leave Australia at 13/2. Morris and Hassett <b>rebuilt</b> <b>the</b> innings, adding 69 {{for the third}} wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett fell. Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126/3 at stumps.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{depression}} in the 1930s and war in the 1940s caused Grotrian-Steinweg to decline severely and then lose its factory completely. The family <b>rebuilt</b> <b>the</b> factory and re-established its reputation for quality work. In the 1950s, an annual piano-playing competition was founded by the company, to identify promising young piano students.|$|E
5|$|Fires were a {{constant}} problem as the palace compound was constructed {{almost entirely of}} wood. The Daigokuden was reconstructed after fires in 876, 1068 and in 1156 despite its limited use. However, after the major fire of 1177 which destroyed much of the Greater Palace, the Daigokuden was never again <b>rebuilt.</b> <b>The</b> Burakuin was destroyed by a fire in 1063 and was never rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|Henry II had {{a square}} stone keep {{constructed}} in the 1180s by first Theobald de Valoignes and then Hugh de Morville, who <b>rebuilt</b> <b>the</b> remains of the castle. It was placed into the bailey wall, allowing it to directly support the outer defences. Thomas de Wyrkington conducted further work between 1199 and 1202 for King John, converting the castle entirely into stone.|$|E
5|$|In 1673, Francis Mildmay's widow Mary and son, Walter Mildmay, {{sold the}} {{remainder}} of the manor to Sir William Glynne, 1st Baronet, of Bicester. Sir William <b>rebuilt</b> <b>the</b> manor house shortly afterwards. Ambrosden remained with the Glynne family until Sir Stephen Glynne, 3rd Baronet sold it in 1729.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, the {{jubilee year}} of the orphanage’s founding, a fire {{destroyed}} the third floor and wooden roof of the main building, and damaged the second floor where the church was housed. Ludwig Schneller, a son of the founder who was the administrator at the time, managed to collect over 200,000 marks in donations from Germany and <b>rebuilt</b> <b>the</b> entire structure.

5|$|In the 1980s, the {{stations}} on the Sognsvann Line were <b>rebuilt.</b> <b>The</b> platforms were lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains and the platform height was increased. The third rail {{made it impossible}} to cross the line at-grade; an underpass was therefore constructed at Berg station. The station was also redesigned in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds designed by architect Arne Henriksen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the valley}} temple of Menkaure, Nyuserre {{extended}} the eastern annex, where he added {{two sets of}} alabaster columns, <b>rebuilt</b> <b>the</b> main entrance and refurbished the limestone causeway leading from the valley temple to the high temple.

5|$|Major repairs {{were carried}} out {{beginning}} in 1825. The floor-level was raised above flood-level, a full three feet. The roof was <b>rebuilt,</b> <b>the</b> south wall was rebuilt using the original materials, and the main features of the 12th-century chancel arch were discarded.|$|E
