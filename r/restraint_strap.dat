40|$|Current {{options for}} Lunar habitat {{architecture}} include inflatable habitats and airlocks. Inflatable structures can have mass and volume advantages over conventional structures. Inflatable structures {{are perceived to}} carry additional risk because they are at a lower Technical Readiness Level (TRL) than conventional metallic structures. One of {{the risks associated with}} inflatable structures is understanding the tolerance to component damage and the resulting behavior of the system after the damage is introduced. The Damage Tolerance Test (DTT) is designed to study the structural integrity of an expandable structure during and subsequent to induced damage. The TransHab Project developed an experimental inflatable module developed at Johnson Space Center in the 1990 's. The TransHab design was originally envisioned for use in Mars Transits but was also studied as a potential habitat for the International Space Station (ISS). The design of the TransHab module was based on a woven design using an Aramid fabric. Testing of this design demonstrated a high level of predictability and repeatability and good correlation with analytical predictions of stresses and deflections. Based on JSC's experience with the design and analysis of woven inflatable structures, the Damage Tolerance Test article was designed and fabricated using a woven design. The Damage Tolerance Test Article consists of a load bearing restraint layer, a bladder or gas barrier, and a structural metallic core. The test article restraint layer is fabricated from one inch wide Kevlar webbing that is woven in a basket weave pattern. Underneath the structural restraint layer is the bladder or gas barrier. For this test the bladder was required to maintain pressure for testing only and was not representative of a flight design. The bladder and structural restraint layer attach to the structural core of the module at steel bulkheads at each end. The two bulkheads are separated by a 10 foot center tube which provides the structural support for the module when in a non-inflated state as well as resists a portion of the axial load when pressurized. The longitudinal members of the structural restraint layer are attached to the bulkheads using a series of clevises that are bolted to the bulkheads. Strain gages are placed on the clevises that can measure change in load when the structural restraint is inflated. The test module is 88 inches in diameter and 120 inches in height. The objectives of the DTT are to (1) verify the structural integrity of the assembled and pressurized structure when a section of the structural restraint layer is cut by a foreign object, and (2) verify the load distribution of the structural restraint layer during pressurization, before and after the structural restraint layer is severed. For this test, a longitudinal structural <b>restraint</b> <b>strap</b> will be severed using a linear shape charge. The linear shape charge was designed specifically for this application to cut only a single longitudinal strap, while not damaging the bladder. An array of strain gages were located at the bulkhead mounted clevises where the longitudinal restraint layer straps are attached. The DTT article was inflated to 45 psig, 25 % of the ultimate design pressure, and one of the one-inch wide longitudinal structural members was severed. Strain gage measurements of loading in an array of longitudinal straps were taken throughout pressurization of the module to 45 psig, before firing of the linear shape charge, and after firing of the shape charge and separation of the strap. During testing not only were the original objectives met but better than expected results occurred. This paper will discuss space inflatable structures, damage tolerance analysis, test results, and applicability to the Lunar architecture...|$|E

Models configured with sophisticated computer analyses permit researchers to perform extensive “what-if? ” exploratory studies {{at a fraction of the}} cost and time that would be required by physical testing alone. Presently, our research team is developing a modeling and analysis capability that will provide child restraint system (CRS) engineers, designers, and analysts a validation tool that will supplement conventional engineering results attained from sled testing, which is often timely and costly. Supplementing these physical tests and digital modeling capabilities is the newly developed NYSCEDII CRS Visualization Module (NCVM), which allows a user to immersively visualize the MADYMO-calculated automotive crash simulation imagery. Depicted are the motion of, and interactions between, the CRS shell, human “dummy”, harness and latch belt assemblies, and applicable vehicle cabin-interior surfaces and structure; and nodal finite element Von Mises color stress contours for the CRS shell and its attendant <b>restraint</b> <b>straps.</b> Supplemental NCVM features include: plotted instantaneous body segment acceleration-time responses; dummy displacements visually tracked using on-screen reference markers- to be tracked as a function of time; forwards or backwards animation capability; and stereo viewing, using anaglyphic stereo, to convey a sense of depth and immersion. This paper demonstrates the utility of the NCVM using a combination conventional/finite element system model of a recent-production child restraint system (CRS) and its three-year-old dummy occupant in a modified FMVSS 213 sled test environment...|$|R

Models configured with sophisticated computer analyses such as Madymo permit researchers to perform extensive “what if? ” and other exploratory studies {{at a fraction of the}} cost and time that would be required by means of physical testing alone. However, fully understanding and correctly interpreting the results generated by complex crash simulations is often an inherently difficult task, despite the availability of high-caliber, multi-perspective post-processing code imagery. The NYSCEDII CRS Visualization Module (NCVM) serves as a potentially useful 3 -D, fully integrated add-on component to the Madymo dynamics analysis software. This paper demonstrates the utility of the NCVM using a combination conventional/finite element system model of a recent-production child restraint system (CRS) and its three-year-old dummy occupant in a modified FMVSS 213 sled test environment. Primarily, the NCVM allows the user to immersively visualize, at every time step of the simulation, the Madymo-calculated imagery depicting: (1) the motion of, and interactions between, the CRS shell, human “dummy”, harness and latch belt assemblies, and applicable vehicle cabin-interior surfaces and structure; and (2) nodal finite element Von Mises color stress contours for the CRS shell and its attendant <b>restraint</b> <b>straps.</b> Supplementary NCVM features include the following: (a) instantaneous body segment acceleration-time responses which can be depicted using an on-screen plotting utility; (b) on-screen reference markers which enable selected dummy displacements to be tracked as a function of time; (c) the simulation is viewable as either a forward-continuous animation or- to better understand localized displacements- frame by frame, forwards or backwards; and (d) the simulation can be viewed in either active or anaglyphic stereo to convey a sense of depth and immersion. 1...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{show that}} {{repeated}} {{shock and vibration}} during aero medical and ground transport are causing patient pain and may be adversely affecting patients’ medical outcome. Patients with spine and head injuries and other severe neurological injuries are the most vulnerable to repeated shock and vibration exposure caused by the vehicle. It is crucial to minimize {{the effects of these}} forces on patients during air and ground medical transport. The development of new medical evacuation platforms creates a need to better understand the effects of human exposure to shock and vibration. The use of human subjects to measure whole body vibration for the evaluation of patient transport systems generates a challenge for designers of and evaluators of enroute care systems. Therefore two different supine manikins were created for this project, manikin 1 and manikin 2. Manikin 2 was a modification of manikin 1 so that it would have a closer biodynamic response to that of humans when subjected to repeated shock and vibration. The main objective of this project was to test the two manikins under various conditions and compare the results. The manikins’ design was based on the standards of a 95 th percentile male. Another objective was to analyze the utilization of a litter air bladder to lower the consequences of human exposure to repeated shock and vibration due to aero medical transport. The vibration signals used to perform the test were derived from research performed at the United States Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory at Fort Rucker Alabama. The vibration signals were captured from field tests conducted on a medevac litter mounted in a HH- 60 M Black Hawk helicopter in different modes of flight. After processing the recorded data, laboratory vibration tests were conducted on the manikins placed in the supine position to obtain the acceleration and transmissibility magnitudes at different locations on the manikins and the stirrup of the litter. The square root of the sum of the squares (RSS) acceleration in the real time was calculated to examine various <b>strap</b> <b>restraint</b> and stirrup clearance configurations and the effects of the use of the air bladder. The results exposed the differences between manikin 1 and manikin 2. The resonant frequency of the manikins plus litter was approximately 4 Hz. In addition, the accelerations increased as the <b>straps</b> <b>restraint</b> was increased, which was expected as the manikins were less likely to move. For some conditions, the increase of stirrup clearance caused the acceleration values increase. Test results indicated the use of the air bladder between the manikins and litter resulted in an increase in acceleration values...|$|R
40|$|This report {{argues that}} the Commonwealth has failed {{to work with the}} Northern Territory to provide {{accommodation}} and other support services, other than accommodation in a maximum security prison, for people with intellectual disabilities who are unfit to plead to criminal charges. Overview Four Aboriginal men with intellectual and cognitive disabilities were held for years in a maximum security prison in the Northern Territory despite being found unfit to stand trial or {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity.   If two of these men had been found guilty they would have received a sentence of 12 months. Instead, they were imprisoned for four and a half years and six years respectively. The Australian Human Rights Commission conducted an inquiry into whether this involved any breach of human rights by Commonwealth. The Commission found that there was a failure by the Commonwealth to work with the Northern Territory to provide accommodation and other support services, other than accommodation in a maximum security prison, for people with intellectual disabilities who are unfit to plead to criminal charges.   There was an obligation at international law on the Commonwealth to act.   This obligation was consistent with domestic obligations undertaken by the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory.  The need for action was well known and had been well known for many years.   Specific administrative measures to take this action were provided for by legislation.   The failure to act was inconsistent with or contrary to the complainants’ rights under articles 9 (1) and 10 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and articles 14 (1), 19, 25, 26 (1) and 28 (1) of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.   In particular, it was contrary to their right not to be arbitrarily detained, and their right as people with disabilities to live in the community with choices equal to others. In the case of Mr KA and Mr KD, the failure to act was also inconsistent with article 7 of the ICCPR and article 15 of the CRPD which prohibit inhuman or degrading treatment.   Mr KA was subject to regular <b>restraint</b> including being <b>strapped</b> to a chair and the use of shackles when outside his cell, seclusion and use of tranquilizers.   Mr KD was subject to regular seclusion and use of tranquilizers.   The prison environment in which they continue to be detained is inappropriate for people with their disabilities. The Commission made the following recommendations: 	The Commonwealth provide a copy of the Commission’s findings to the Northern Territory and seek assurances from the Northern Territory that it will take immediate steps to identify alternative accommodation arrangements for each of the complainants so that Mr KA and Mr KD are no longer detained in a prison and Mr KB and Mr KC are progressively moved out of held detention. These arrangements should be the least restrictive arrangements appropriate to each individual and should include a plan to progressively move each of them into the community along with necessary support services. 	The Commonwealth cooperate with the Northern Territory to establish an appropriate range of facilities in the Northern Territory so that people with cognitive impairment who are subject to a custodial supervision order can be accommodated in places other than prisons. This range of facilities should include secure care facilities and supported community supervision. The number of places available in these facilities should be sufficient to cater for the number of people who are anticipated to make use of them. 	The Commonwealth cooperate with the Northern Territory to ensure that people with cognitive impairment who have not been convicted of an offence are detained as a measure of last resort, for the shortest appropriate period of time, and in the least restrictive appropriate environment. 	The Commonwealth cooperate with the Northern Territory to ensure that when a person with a cognitive impairment is detained under a custodial supervision order, a plan is put in place to move that person into progressively less restrictive environments and eventually out of detention. 	The Commonwealth cooperate with the Northern Territory to develop model service system standards for the detention of people with a cognitive impairment. 	The Commonwealth cooperate with the Northern Territory to ensure that when a person with a cognitive impairment is detained he or she is provided with appropriate advice and support, including the appointment of a guardian or advocate. The Commonwealth did not directly respond to these recommendations, on the basis that it considered that the Commission did not have jurisdiction to inquire into the complaints. As this decision can be reviewed under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), this is the only statement the Commission will be making on this matter...|$|R
