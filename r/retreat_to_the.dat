5|$|Between 21 and 23 September the Ottoman III Corps (Ottoman Seventh Army) {{fought a}} rearguard action from Tubas to the Jordan River, which delayed the British cavalry encirclement and enable what {{remained}} of the Ottoman Eighth Army and the Ottoman Seventh Army to <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastern side of the Jordan River.|$|E
5|$|Chetwode {{ordered the}} {{continuation}} of the XX Corps' attacks; the 10th Division was to capture Nablus, the 53rd Division was to advance towards the high ground north and north east of Nablus, {{in the direction of the}} Wadi el Fara road, to capture and control this line of <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jordan Valley.|$|E
5|$|Nairn Ridge {{remained}} in Ottoman hands until about 19:00 on 19 September, {{when it was}} finally captured and the road works could begin, and the 53rd Division could start their attempt to block the line of <b>retreat,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jordan River at Mafid Jozele.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the enemies}} re-entered the culvert and blasted a wide {{hole in the}} wall using an {{ambiguous}} explosive device invented by Saruman, a [...] "blasting-fire". Some defenders then <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Glittering Caves, Éomer, Gamling and Gimli among them, while others including Aragorn and Legolas <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> burg itself.|$|R

5|$|The 53rd Division {{maintained}} pressure {{during the}} day {{in an attempt to}} capture the high ground north and north east of Nablus to seal the lines of <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jordan River crossing at Jisr ed Damieh.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Red Cliffs {{unfolded}} in three stages: an initial skirmish at Red Cliffs {{followed by a}} <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wulin (烏林) battlefields on the northwestern bank of the Yangtze, a decisive naval engagement, and Cao Cao's disastrous retreat along Huarong Road.|$|E
5|$|This {{variation}} {{is named after}} Alekhine thanks to his wins in the games Alekhine–Rabinovic (Baden Baden, 1925) and Alekhine–Seitz (Hastings, 1926). White does not try to keep its material advantage (the e5-pawn) and concentrates on establishing a strong pawn center and space advantage. A controversial point is whether the typical black manoeuvre Bf8–b4–xc3 is advantageous for Black (as it saddles White with doubled pawns) or for White (as it reinforces his centre). Lalic thinks both, considering 6...Bb4+ {{to be a bad}} move after 4...Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Nf3, but a good one after 4...Nxe5 5.f4Nec6 6.Be3. After 4.e4 the main line is 4...Nxe55.f4 when Black has an important choice to make about where to move the Ne5. The <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> queenside with 5...Nec6 is considered best, while the <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kingside with 5...Ng6 is probably playable.|$|E

5|$|Chauvel's envelopment was {{extended}} at 09:25, when Chaytor ordered a regiment {{to circle the}} entrenched positions and move through Aulad Ali, to cut off a possible line of <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south and south east. The 10th Light Horse Regiment with two sections of the brigade Machine Gun Squadron, led by Brigadier General J. R. Royston, commander of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, succeeded in capturing Aulad Ali and 300 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Crucially, the Prussians did not <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, {{along their}} own lines of communication. Instead, they, too, fell back northwards—parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within {{supporting}} distance and {{in communication with}} him throughout. The Prussians rallied on Bülow's IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of Wavre.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the fall}} of the Raevsky redoubt did not have much meaning. The Russian troops {{successfully}} moved to the rear without being destroyed (despite suffering heavy losses). So, in spite of losing some areas in the battlefield, the Russian formation was prevented from collapsing. On the French side, the gain of the Raevsky redoubt cost them large casualties and, after that, Napoleon himself ordered his troops to <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> starting line. The Russians then reoccupied their previous positions.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} attack force moved south towards Østerport {{where the}} fortification Kastellet laid. The Swedes got {{very close to}} Nyboder and {{were in the process}} of crossing the moat, when they fell victim to a well-conducted ambush, and withdrew with heavy losses. Around 6 in the morning, Charles X of Sweden knew that all attacks had failed. He ordered a <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outskirts of the city, back to the starting position.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottoman Army's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Beersheba, {{the loss to}} the Central Powers of {{southern}} Palestine, the <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Judean Hills {{and the loss of}} Jerusalem at the end of 1917, several Ottoman army commanders in Palestine were replaced. The Yildirim Army Group's German commander, General Erich von Falkenhayn, was replaced by the German General Otto Liman von Sanders. The commander of the Eighth Army, Kress von Kressenstein, was replaced by Djevad Pasha and Cemal commander of the Ottoman Army, appointed Cemal Kucjuk Pasha to command the Fourth Army. Mustafa Kemal had resigned as commander of the Seventh Army in 1917 but was back by early September 1918.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating Jourdan's move, Charles rushed {{his army}} toward battle at Würzburg on 1 September. Marshaling the {{divisions}} of Hotze, Sztáray, Kray, Johann Sigismund Riesch, Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein and Wartensleben, the Austrians won the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September, forcing the French to <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lahn river. Charles lost 1,500 casualties out of 44,000 troops there, while inflicting 2,000 casualties on the outnumbered French. Another authority gave French losses as 2,000 killed and wounded plus 1,000 men and seven guns captured, while Austrian losses numbered 1,200 killed and wounded and 300 captured. Regardless, the losses at Würzburg compelled the French {{to lift the}} siege of Mainz on 7 September, and to move those troops to reinforce their lines further east.|$|E

5|$|As {{this was}} happening, General Dean arrived {{south of the}} town with Lieutenant General Walton Walker to observe the conflict, and the final {{elements}} of the 34th leave Chonan. Dean ordered the 34th Infantry Regiment to <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kum River. 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry, now down to 175 men, had lost two thirds of its strength in Chonan, around 350 men. Most of the battalion's heavy equipment including mortars and machine guns were also lost. The North Korean radio reported 60 Americans were taken prisoner in the town. The regiment began its retreat in the late afternoon, with North Korean forces moving on ridges parallel to the regiment. Most of the battalion moved out on foot and by truck, resting {{on the evening of}} July 8 before arriving at the Kum River July 9 and setting up new defensive positions.|$|E
5|$|At about 2:00 pm the French {{attacked}} Castel Ceriolo {{and delayed}} {{the advance of}} Schellenberg’s column by attacking its tail. Aided by Frimont, Ott defeated Monnier and forced two-thirds of his command to <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast. About the same time, Marengo had fallen to the Austrians, forcing Napoleon's men into a general retreat. As Austrian troops crossed the Fontanone, their guns bombarded the French infantry in the vines. In a bid to further delay Schellenberg’s advance, Bonaparte committed his main Guard battalion and its artillery, which moved to flank the column. After driving off Austrian dragoons {{with the aid of}} GdB Champeaux’s remaining cavalry (under Joachim Murat), they engaged the head of the column. After a 15-minute firefight around 4:00 pm the Guard were surprised and destroyed by Frimont’s cavalry.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, the 15th Brigade IV Corps {{was sent to}} link up with the Nassauers of Wellington's left flank in the Frichermont-La Haie area, with the brigade's horse {{artillery}} battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to its left in support. Napoleon sent Lobau's corps to stop the rest of Bülow's IV Corps proceeding to Plancenoit. The 15th Brigade threw Lobau's troops out of Frichermont with a determined bayonet charge, then proceeded up the Frichermont heights, battering French Chasseurs with 12-pounder artillery fire, and pushed on to Plancenoit. This sent Lobau's corps into <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Plancenoit area, driving Lobau past {{the rear of the}} Armee Du Nord's right flank and directly threatening its only line of retreat. Hiller's 16th Brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against Plancenoit.|$|E

5|$|In despair, Vitellius {{attempted}} {{to negotiate a}} surrender. Terms of peace, including a voluntary abdication, were agreed upon with Titus Flavius Sabinus II but the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard—the imperial bodyguard—considered such a resignation disgraceful and prevented Vitellius from carrying out the treaty. On the morning of 18 December, the emperor appeared to deposit the imperial insignia at the Temple of Concord {{but at the last}} minute retraced his steps to the Imperial palace. In the confusion, the leading men of the state gathered at Sabinus' house, proclaiming Vespasian as Emperor, but the multitude dispersed when Vitellian cohorts clashed with the armed escort of Sabinus, who was forced to <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Capitoline Hill.|$|E
5|$|In round four, Judah {{landed a}} {{right hand to}} the head that caused Mayweather to <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ropes and cover up. The {{momentum}} changed in the fifth round, when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination to the face. Then Mayweather landed a right hand {{on the bridge of}} Judah's nose, and blood began to flow. The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point. Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into a corner, and Judah's foot movement was considerably slower than it had been earlier in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Indian cavalry {{participated in}} actions {{on both the}} Western and Palestinian fronts {{throughout}} the war. Members of the 1st and 2nd Indian Cavalry Divisions were active on the Western Front, including in the German <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hindenburg Line and at the Battle of Cambrai. A charge by the 5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade of the 1st Division ended successfully at the Battle of Cambrai despite being against a position fortified by barbed wire and machine guns. This successful ending was an unusual occurrence during the war. Several Indian cavalry divisions joined Allenby's troops {{in the spring of}} 1918 after being transferred from the Western Front.|$|E

50|$|The Japanese {{overwhelmed}} the defenses by scaling the walls {{under cover of}} the arquebus fire. <b>The</b> Koreans <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second line of defense after the surprise attack of Sō Yoshitoshi. General Jeong Bal (Hangul: 정발, Hanja: 鄭撥) regrouped his archers and counterattacked. By now, <b>the</b> Koreans had <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third line of defence. After hours of fighting, the Koreans ran out of arrows. The Japanese were taking losses and regrouped to attack again.|$|R
