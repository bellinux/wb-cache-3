5|$|Charged {{particles}} have {{a considerable}} {{influence on the}} surface properties of Galilean moons. Plasma originating from Io carries sulfur and sodium ions farther from the planet, where they are implanted preferentially on the trailing hemispheres of Europa and Ganymede. On Callisto however, for unknown reasons, sulfur is concentrated on the leading hemisphere. Plasma may also be responsible for darkening the moons' trailing hemispheres (again, except Callisto's). Energetic electrons and ions, with the flux of the latter being more isotropic, bombard surface ice, sputtering atoms and molecules off and causing <b>radiolysis</b> of water and other chemical compounds. The energetic particles break water into oxygen and hydrogen, maintaining the thin oxygen atmospheres of the icy moons (since the hydrogen escapes more rapidly). The compounds produced radiolytically on the surfaces of Galilean moons also include ozone and hydrogen peroxide. If organics or carbonates are present, carbon dioxide, methanol and carbonic acid can be produced as well. In the presence of sulfur, likely products include sulfur dioxide, hydrogen disulfide and sulfuric acid. Oxidants produced by <b>radiolysis,</b> like oxygen and ozone, may be trapped inside the ice and carried downward to the oceans over geologic time intervals, thus serving as a possible energy source for life.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{extensive}} magnetosphere envelops its {{ring system}} and the orbits of all four Galilean satellites. Orbiting near the magnetic equator, these bodies serve as sources and sinks of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces. The particles sputter off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via <b>radiolysis.</b> The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries. In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Observations of {{the surface}} have {{revealed}} {{that some of the}} molecular oxygen produced by <b>radiolysis</b> is not ejected from the surface. Because the surface may interact with the subsurface ocean (considering the geological discussion above), this molecular oxygen may make its way to the ocean, where it could aid in biological processes. One estimate suggests that, given the turnover rate inferred from the apparent ~0.5 Gyr maximum age of Europa's surface ice, subduction of radiolytically generated oxidizing species might well lead to oceanic free oxygen concentrations that are comparable to those in terrestrial deep oceans.|$|E
5|$|Polonium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Po and atomic number 84. A rare and highly radioactive metal with no stable isotopes, polonium is chemically similar to selenium and tellurium, though its metallic character {{resembles that of}} its horizontal neighbors in the periodic table: thallium, lead, and bismuth. Due to the short half-life of all its isotopes, its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting polonium-210 (with a half-life of 138days) in uranium ores, {{as it is the}} penultimate daughter of natural uranium-238. Though slightly longer-lived isotopes exist, they are much more difficult to produce. Today, polonium is usually produced in milligram quantities by the neutron irradiation of bismuth. Due to its intense radioactivity, which results in the <b>radiolysis</b> of chemical bonds and radioactive self-heating, its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only.|$|E
25|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} {{can generate}} damaging intermediates through the interaction with water, a process termed <b>radiolysis.</b> Since water comprises 55–60% {{of the human}} body, the probability of <b>radiolysis</b> is quite high under the presence of ionizing radiation. In the process, water loses an electron and becomes highly reactive. Then through a three-step chain reaction, water is sequentially converted to hydroxyl radical (•OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide radical (•) and ultimately oxygen (O2).|$|E
25|$|The manganate(IV) anion {{has been}} {{prepared}} by <b>radiolysis</b> of dilute solutions of permanganate. It is mononuclear in dilute solution, and shows a strong absorption in the ultraviolet and a weaker absorption at 650nm.|$|E
25|$|During <b>radiolysis</b> of the Pressure Suppression Pool {{water below}} the Chernobyl reactor, {{hydrogen}} peroxide was formed. The {{hypothesis that the}} pool water was partially converted to H2O2 is confirmed by {{the identification of the}} white crystalline minerals studtite and metastudtite in the Chernobyl lavas, the only minerals that contain peroxide.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the action of radiation upon underground water is responsible for the formation of hydrogen which was converted by bacteria into methane.. A series of papers on the subject of bacteria living under {{the surface of the earth}} which are fed by the hydrogen generated by the <b>radiolysis</b> of water can be read on line.|$|E
25|$|Stable coolant. Molten {{fluorides}} are {{chemically stable}} and impervious to radiation. The salts do not burn, explode, or decompose, even under high temperature and radiation. There are no rapid violent reactions {{with water and}} air that sodium coolant has. There is no combustible hydrogen production that water coolants have. However the salt is not stable to radiation at low (less than 100 C) temperatures due to <b>radiolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The plasma and {{energetic}} particles {{present in the}} magnetosphere of Saturn, when absorbed by ring particles and moons, cause <b>radiolysis</b> of the water ice. Its products include ozone, hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. The first one has been detected in the surfaces of Rhea and Dione, while the second {{is thought to be}} responsible for the steep spectral slopes of moons' reflectivities in the ultraviolet region. The oxygen produced by <b>radiolysis</b> forms tenuous atmospheres around rings and icy moons. The ring atmosphere was detected by Cassini {{for the first time in}} 2004. A fraction of the oxygen gets ionized, creating a small population of O2+ ions in the magnetosphere. The influence of Saturn's magnetosphere on its moons is more subtle than the influence of Jupiter on its moons. In the latter case, the magnetosphere contains a significant number of sulfur ions, which, when implanted in surfaces, produce characteristic spectral signatures. In the case of Saturn, the radiation levels are much lower and the plasma is composed mainly of water products, which, when implanted, are indistinguishable from the ice already present.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{seawater}} has {{the potential}} to make uranium chemistry more complex; in pure water the hydrogen peroxide formed by the <b>radiolysis</b> of water can react with uranium dioxide to form a solid peroxide mineral known as studtite. According to Navrotsky et al. this mineral has been found in the fuel storage pond at the plutonium production site at Hanford. Navrotsky et al. report that when alkali metal ions are present, uranium can form nanoparticles (U60 clusters) which may be more mobile than the solid studtite. A review of the research done at the University of Notre Dame on the subject of nanoscale actinyl clusters was published in 2010.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{possible}} to do some types of research using an irradiator much like that used for gamma sterilization, it is common in some areas of science to use a time resolved experiment where a material is subjected to a pulse of radiation (normally electrons from a LINAC). After the pulse of radiation, the concentration of different substances within the material are measured by emission spectroscopy or Absorption spectroscopy, hence the rates of reactions can be determined. This allows the relative abilities of substances to react with the reactive species generated by the action of radiation on the solvent (commonly water) to be measured. This experiment is known as pulse <b>radiolysis</b> which is closely related to Flash photolysis.|$|E
25|$|Many {{compounds}} {{of thorium}} are known: {{this is because}} thorium and uranium are the most stable and accessible actinides and are the only actinides that can be studied safely and legally in bulk in a normal laboratory. As such, they have the best-known chemistry of the actinides, along with that of plutonium, as the self-heating and radiation from them {{is not enough to}} cause <b>radiolysis</b> of chemical bonds as it is for the other actinides. While the later actinides from americium onwards are predominantly trivalent and behave more similarly to the corresponding lanthanides, as one would expect from periodic trends, the early actinides up to plutonium (thus including thorium and uranium) have relativistically destabilised and hence delocalised 5f and 6d electrons that participate in chemistry in a similar way to the early transition metals of group 3 through 8: thus, all their valence electrons can participate in chemical reactions, although this is not common for neptunium and plutonium.|$|E
25|$|Asphalt {{was used}} {{starting}} in the 1960s as an hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha-emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation {{because of the presence}} of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma <b>radiolysis.</b> A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.|$|E
500|$|Another {{hypothesis}} for {{the colored}} regions {{is that they}} are composed of abiotic organic compounds collectively called tholins. The morphology of Europa's impact craters and ridges is suggestive of fluidized material welling up from the fractures where pyrolysis and <b>radiolysis</b> take place. In order to generate colored tholins on Europa there must be a source of materials (carbon, nitrogen, and water) and a source of energy to make the reactions occur. Impurities in the water ice crust of Europa are presumed both to emerge from the interior as cryovolcanic events that resurface the body, and to accumulate from space as interplanetary dust. Tholins bring [...] important astrobiological implications, as they {{may play a role in}} prebiotic chemistry and abiogenesis.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{the oxygen}} in Earth's atmosphere, Europa's {{is not of}} {{biological}} origin. The surface-bounded atmosphere forms through <b>radiolysis,</b> the dissociation of molecules through radiation. Solar ultraviolet radiation and charged particles (ions and electrons) from the Jovian magnetospheric environment collide with Europa's icy surface, splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen constituents. These chemical components are then adsorbed and [...] "sputtered" [...] into the atmosphere. The same radiation also creates collisional ejections of these products from the surface, and the balance of these two processes forms an atmosphere. Molecular oxygen is the densest component of the atmosphere {{because it has a}} long lifetime; after returning to the surface, it does not stick (freeze) like a water or hydrogen peroxide molecule but rather desorbs from the surface and starts another ballistic arc. Molecular hydrogen never reaches the surface, as it is light enough to escape Europa's surface gravity.|$|E
500|$|Astatine {{was first}} {{produced}} by bombarding bismuth-209 with energetic alpha particles, {{and this is}} still the major route used to create the relatively long-lived isotopes astatine-209 through astatine-211. Astatine is only produced in minuscule quantities, with modern techniques allowing production runs of up to 6.6gigabecquerels (about 86nanograms or 2.47 × 1014 atoms). Synthesis of greater quantities of astatine using this method is constrained by the limited availability of suitable cyclotrons {{and the prospect of}} melting the target. who encapsulate the bismuth target in a thin aluminium foil and place it in a niobium holder capable of holding molten bismuth.}} Solvent <b>radiolysis</b> due to the cumulative effect of astatine decay is a related problem. With cryogenic technology, microgram quantities of astatine might be able to be generated via proton irradiation of thorium or uranium to yield radon-211, in turn decaying to astatine-211. Contamination with astatine-210 {{is expected to be a}} drawback of this method.At-Labeled Radiopharmaceuticals | journal = The Journal of Nuclear Medicine [...] | volume = 42 [...] | issue = 10 [...] | pages = 1516–1518 | url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/42/10/1516|pmid=11585866}} ...|$|E
500|$|The {{process was}} {{improved}} again, to allow repeated separation of lanthanum from the barium solution, as the lanthanum built up. Initially, a phosphate process was used, where lanthanum was precipitated as lanthanum phosphate. This was later abandoned when an oxalate or hydroxide method was developed; lanthanum was precipitated as lanthanum hydroxide and then {{converted to a}} filterable precipitate by addition of oxalate with a trace of fluoride. The oxalate method had to be performed quickly, as the oxalate ion was susceptible to <b>radiolysis</b> and the lanthanum had the tendency {{to go back into}} solution. The oxalate process could be performed by remotely operated devices. The batches contained about [...] of radiolanthanum, the highest radiation levels people had ever worked with at that time. Special tools had to be developed for remote handling of the hot materials. Lead bricks were used for shielding the sources. The radiation dose limit for the personnel was set to 500mrem (5mSv) per source preparation. Sometimes this limit was exceeded; once the received dose was 2rem (20mSv).|$|E
500|$|Several {{obstacles}} {{have been}} {{encountered in the}} development of astatine-based radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment. World War II delayed research for close to a decade. Results of early experiments indicated that a cancer-selective carrier would need to be developed and {{it was not until the}} 1970s that monoclonal antibodies became available for this purpose. Unlike iodine, astatine shows a tendency to dehalogenate from molecular carriers such as these, particularly at sp3 carbon sites (less so from sp2 sites). Given the toxicity of astatine accumulated and retained in the body, this emphasized the need to ensure it remained attached to its host molecule. While astatine carriers that are slowly metabolized can be assessed for their efficacy, more rapidly metabolized carriers remain a significant obstacle to the evaluation of astatine in nuclear medicine. Mitigating the effects of astatine-induced <b>radiolysis</b> of labeling chemistry and carrier molecules is another area requiring further development. A practical application for astatine as a cancer treatment would potentially be suitable for a [...] "staggering" [...] number of patients; production of astatine in the quantities that would be required remains an issue.|$|E
500|$|Curium ions in {{solution}} {{almost exclusively}} assume the oxidation state of +3, {{which is the}} most stable oxidation state for curium. The +4 oxidation state is observed mainly in a few solid phases, such as CmO2 and CmF4. Aqueous curium(IV) is only known in the presence of strong oxidizers such as potassium persulfate, and is easily reduced to curium(III) by <b>radiolysis</b> and even by water. The chemical behavior of curium is different from the actinides thorium and uranium, and {{is similar to that of}} americium and many lanthanides. In aqueous solution, the Cm3+ ion is colorless to pale green, and Cm4+ ion is pale yellow. The optical absorption of Cm3+ ions contains three sharp peaks at 375.4, 381.2 and 396.5 nanometers and their strength can be directly converted into the concentration of the ions. The +6 oxidation state has only been reported once in solution in 1978, as the curyl ion (...) : this was prepared from the beta decay of americium-242 in the americium(V) ion [...] Failure to obtain Cm(VI) from oxidation of Cm(III) and Cm(IV) may be due to the high Cm4+/Cm3+ ionization potential and the instability of Cm(V).|$|E
500|$|In situ {{investigations}} {{have been performed}} on Mars by the Viking landers, Spirit and Opportunity rovers, Phoenix lander, and Curiosity rover. Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown. The Viking probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results, including a temporary increase of CO2 production on exposure to water and nutrients. This sign of life was later disputed by scientists, resulting in a continuing debate, with NASA scientist Gilbert Levin asserting that Viking may have found life. A re-analysis of the Viking data, in light of modern knowledge of extremophile forms of life, {{has suggested that the}} Viking tests were not sophisticated enough to detect these forms of life. The tests could even have killed a (hypothetical) life form. Tests conducted by the Phoenix Mars lander have shown that the soil has a alkaline pH and it contains magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride. The soil nutrients may be able to support life, but life would still have to be shielded from the intense ultraviolet light.

2500|$|The {{creation}} of hydroxyl radicals by iron(II) catalysis {{is important because}} iron(II) can be found coordinated with, and therefore in close proximity to, DNA.

2500|$|In sea water, ROS can be {{generated}} through abiotic as well as biotic processes, among which are the <b>radiolysis</b> and photolysis of water molecules and cellular respiration. [...] According to a model proposed by Fan for the prediction of ROS in surface waters, the biochemistry mediated by phytoplankton {{may be just as}} important for the production of ROS as photochemistry. Biological ROS is often synthesized in mitochondrial membranes, as well as the endoplasmic reticulum of animals, plants, and some bacteria. In addition, chloroplasts and the organelles peroxisomes and glyoxysomes are also sites for the generation of ROS. [...] The ROS most likely released to the environment are those produced at the cell surface as electrons get [...] "leaked" [...] from the respiratory chain and react with molecular oxygen, O2. [...] The products of this subsequent reduction of molecular oxygen are what are referred to as reactive oxygen species. [...] Thus, the production of ROS is in direct proportion to the concentration of O2 in the system, with increases of O2 leading to higher production of ROS. There are three main reactive oxygen species: the superoxide anion (O2−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (OH•). [...] The superoxide anion is formed directly from the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is then formed from the disproportionation of the superoxide anion. [...] This reaction occurs very quickly in seawater. [...] Next, the reduction of hydrogen peroxide yields the hydroxyl radical, H2O2↔2OH•, which can then get reduced to the hydroxyl ion and water. [...] However, the presence of reactive oxygen species in marine systems is hard to detect and measure accurately, for a number of reasons. [...] First, ROS concentrations are generally low (nanomoles) in seawater. [...] Second, they may react with other hard to identify molecules that occur in low quantities, resulting in unknown products. [...] Finally, they are (for the most part) transient intermediates, having lifetimes as little as microseconds.|$|E
