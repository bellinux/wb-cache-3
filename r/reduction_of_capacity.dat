5|$|The Taylor Report's {{requirement}} for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At {{the end of}} the 1998–99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used {{for the first time on}} 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record. The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4–1, with just 114 seats (0.15percent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied. In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> by 255 to 75,957.

50|$|Though {{there was}} a slight revival after 1945, mills closed. The most {{efficient}} mills had abandoned their steam engines, and were working the frames with individual electric motors. Broadstone Mills Stockport, was built as a double mill with 265,000 mule spindles, but by 1959 it was running 37,500 mule spindles and 70,000 ring spindles. It closed in 1959 taking advantage of the Cotton Industry Act 1959 and was then used by the John Myers mail order company.

50|$|Route {{capacity}} is maximised for any rail system {{when all the}} rail traffic is the same type. Mixing different types of trains, or even different stopping patterns, {{will result in a}} substantial <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity.</b> Where different types of trains are mixed together this is sometimes called heterogeneity. In this context different types of trains means those that are slower than other trains, for example, freight and passenger trains. Freight trains often accelerate and brake more slowly than passenger, and have lower top speeds. Also passenger trains that have different stopping patterns, such as a local all stops service, when mixed with a limited or express service, will result in a reduction of route capacity. Route {{capacity is}} not lost where all the trains on one route stop at all stations, but only where trains with different stopping patterns are mixed together.|$|E

[...] Margaret Thatcher Benefits during Ayling's {{leadership}} included cost savings of £750 million {{and the establishment}} of the successful, but highly subsidised, Go in 1998. Go was a low-cost carrier intended to compete in the rapidly emerging [...] "no-frills" [...] segment. After four years of successful operations British Airways searched for a buyer for Go, eventually the airline was sold off to venture capitalists 3i and later merged with EasyJet. Ayling also sought a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity,</b> cancelling Boeing 747-400 orders in favour of the Boeing 777-200ER and rationalising BA's short-haul fleet with new Airbus A320 aircraft. However, BA began discussions with Airbus for the eventual procurement of the Airbus A380, a very large passenger jet. In September 1998, British Airways became {{a founding member of the}} Oneworld global airline alliance, along with American Airlines, Canadian Airlines, Cathay Pacific, and Qantas.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the calculation method <b>of</b> shear <b>capacity</b> for fire-damaged reinforced concrete (RC) beams, the reason of drop <b>of</b> shear <b>capacity</b> was analyzed from material properties and transfer mechanisms of RC beams after fire. Formulas <b>of</b> shear <b>capacity</b> were suggested for fire-damaged RC beams. Based on test analysis, the values <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> factors <b>of</b> shear <b>capacity</b> were proposed under concentrated load. The results show that suggested calculation method is capable <b>of</b> predicting shear <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> fire-damaged RC beams exactly. The values <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> factors <b>of</b> shear <b>capacity</b> need further experiments research...|$|R
40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} indicates that electricity producers use production failures to disguise strategic <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> in order to influence prices, but systematic evidence is lacking. We use a quasi-experimental set up and data from the Swedish energy market to examine such behavior. In a market without strategic withholding, the decision of reporting a failure should be independent of the market price. We show that marginal producers in fact base their decision to report a failure in part on prices, which indicates that failures {{are a result of}} economic incentives as well as of technical problems...|$|R

50|$|The issue assumed {{ever greater}} urgency by 2007, {{following}} {{a series of}} inspections which questioned the suitability of Windsor Park to host international football. Following a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> due to {{the closure of the}} Railway Stand, the IFA made it known that they wished to terminate their contract {{for the use of the}} stadium. A report on health and safety in October 2007 indicated that the South Stand might have to be closed for internationals, which would further reduce the stadium's capacity to 9,000.In April 2008, Belfast City Council announced that they had commissioned Drivers Jonas to conduct a feasibility study into the building of a Sports Stadium in Belfast which could accommodate international football, which was followed at the beginning of May 2008 by speculation that the Maze Stadium project was going to be radically revised by Peter Robinson, the finance and personnel minister in the Northern Ireland Assembly, so that any construction might be used for purposes other than football, rugby union and Gaelic games.Given the time that is needed to build a new stadium, in the absence of significant work improving Windsor Park, Northern Ireland may be forced to play their home games at a venue outside Northern Ireland for a period.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{the human}} body, {{there are some}} special systems to {{interact}} with pathogens of free radicals that are called antioxidant immune system in some human diseases.

Material and Methods: This study was a case control study. 50 people with type II diabetes referring to Zahedan diabetic center assigned as case group, they were compared with 50 participants from control group. Both groups had similar age, sex and all other criteria. Total antioxidant <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> saliva evaluated with FRAP (Ferric reducing ability of plasma) method.
