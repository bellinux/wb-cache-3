40|$|Aim. To {{investigate}} the <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> microbiota of primary teeth with apical periodontitis and the in vivo antimicrobial {{effects of a}} calcium hydroxide/chlorhexidine paste used as <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> dressing. Design. Baseline samples were collected from 30 <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> of primary teeth with apical periodontitis. Then, the <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> were filled with a calcium hydroxide paste containing 1 % chlorhexidine for 14 days and the second bacteriologic samples were taken prior to <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> filling. Samples were submitted to microbiologic culture procedure to detect <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> bacteria and processed for checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Results. Baseline microbial culture revealed high prevalence and cfu number of anaerobic, black-pigmented bacteroides, Streptococcus, and aerobic microorganisms. Following <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> dressing, {{the overall number of}} cfu was dramatically diminished compared to initial contamination (P 0. 05). Of 35 probes used for checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization, 31 (88. 57 %) were present at baseline, and following <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> dressing, the number of positive probes reduced to 13 (37. 14 %). Similarly, the number of bacterial cells diminished folowing application of calcium hydroxide/chlorhexidine <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> dressing (P = 0. 006). Conclusion.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to propose a <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> configuration description method and to investigate the <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> system morphology of the maxillary first molar by means of micro-computed tomographic imaging. METHODS The <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> configuration, foramina, and accessory canal frequency of 179 maxillary first molars were investigated by means of micro-computed tomographic imaging and 3 -dimensional software imaging. The <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> configuration and main foramina number are described from coronal to apical with a 4 -digit system. RESULTS The most frequent <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> configurations were 1 - 1 - 1 / 1 (45. 8 %), 2 - 2 - 2 / 2 (25. 1 %) and 2 - 2 - 1 / 1 (10. 1 %) in mesiobuccal roots and 1 - 1 - 1 / 1 in distobuccal (97. 2 %) and palatal (98. 9 %) roots. The first mesiobuccal (MB 1) <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> had 1 accessory canal in 26. 3 % of the teeth, the distobuccal <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> had 12. 3 %, and the palatal <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> had 9. 5 %; in the second mesiobuccal <b>root</b> <b>canal,</b> there was rarely 1 accessory canal.

40|$|Background: The {{knowledge}} of <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> morphology of different teeth {{is important in}} the success of <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment. Investigations of <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> morphology are conducted {{in order to determine the}} number of <b>root</b> <b>canals,</b> presence of lateral canal, accessory canals, location of apical foramen, presence of apical delta and <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> configuration type. These are important variants of <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> morphology and they have direct impact on success of the <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment (RCT). Variation in the number of <b>root</b> <b>canals,</b> their configurations types, of apical delta' and location of apical foramen has been reported to differ within ethnic groups. Clinicians in Tanzania carry out <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment basing on the {{knowledge of}} <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> morphology which was stipulated from different ethnic groups. Data on normal and common variations in the <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> morphology in Tanzanian population is lacking. Objective: To assess the <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> morphology of permanent teeth among the native Tanzanians. Methodology: In this in-vitro study, three hundred and seventy nine (379) extracted permanent teeth were used. The specimen were collected in labeled containers from public dental clinics in Dar es Salam city, and stored in 10 % formalin until when the collection was completed. The access cavity of each tooth was prepared and the pulp tissues were dissolved using 5 % sodium hypochlorite solution. Methylene blue alkaline ink was injected in the <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> and the specimens were processed using demineralization and clearing technique for study of the <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> morphology. The specimens were then examined for tooth length, number of <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> in each <b>root,</b> <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> configuration type in each root, presence of apical delta and location of apical foramen. Results: The mesiobuccal root of upper molars, (47. 5 % of the first molars; 46. 4 % of the second molars) and the distal root of lower molars (40. 4 % of the first molars; 54. 1 % of the second molars) had more variations in the number of <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> than other <b>roots.</b> • 	 VIII The majority of the roots which had two canals had canal configuration type II and IV.

The secondary aim was to examine the influence of tooth type on <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> length measurements as assessed on CBCT scans and PAs. Methods In total, 40 <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> of 33 teeth (molars, premolars, canines, and incisors) out of 5 dentate maxillas of human cadavers were included. <b>Root</b> <b>canal</b> length measurement was performed by a consensus panel (2 examiners) on CBCT scans (3 D Accuitomo 170; J Morita, Kyoto, Japan) and digital PAs. After straight-line access opening, a # 15 file was fixated in every <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> at the length measured on CBCT scans. All teeth were extracted, and the <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> containing the file was uncovered. Measurements made on images taken with a digital camera (AxioCam; Carl Zeiss, Sliedrecht, The Netherlands) linked to a stereozoom microscope (Stemi SV 6, Carl Zeiss) were used as the actual <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> length. Results When all roots were examined together, it was not clear which method is better for all types of teeth. For <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> of anterior teeth, there was no significant difference between the 2 methods. For <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> of posterior teeth, CBCT images gave results significantly closer to the actual <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> length in comparison with PAs (t value = − 1. 96; critical value is 1. 74 with a significance level of 0. 05).

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} success rate of <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> {{treatment}} in primary molars with the use two different <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> instrumentation ways, irrigation solutions and <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> sealers. Materials and Methods: <b>Root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment was applied to 120 second primary molars of 69 children between 5 - 8 years old. The teeth were divided in 8 groups randomly according to instrumentation ways [conventional stainless-steel hand files / Nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti) rotary files], irrigation solutions [0. 5 % sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 0. 9 % saline solution combination / 0. 4 % chlorhehexidine (CHX) ] and <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> sealers [Zinc oxide eugenol cement (ZOE) and Apexit Plus (AP) ]. All teeth were restored with stainless steel crowns. The teeth were followed 12 months both clinically and radiographically. All data was analyzed statistically by χ 2 and Wilcoxon test. Results: Statistical significance were found according to “age ” and “root canal sealers ” factors on success rate of <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment (p 0. 05). The clinically and radiographically success rate of ZOE and AP were 98. 3 % and 68. 3 %, respectively. Conclusions: <b>Root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment is a successful treatment in primary molars. Ni-Ti rotary files and CHX {{can be a good}} alternative for <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment in primary molars. The most effective factor to obtain clinical success of <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment is properties of using <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> sealer...|$|R

40|$|Thorough {{knowledge}} of the <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> morphology, appropriate assessment of the pulp chamber floor, and critical interpretation of radiographs are a prerequisite for successful <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> therapy. The possibility of additional root/canal should be considered even in teeth with a low frequency of abnormal <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> anatomy.
