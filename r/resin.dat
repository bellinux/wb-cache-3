5|$|Members of the red-breasted {{nuthatch}} superspecies excavate their own tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes or old woodpecker nests. Several species {{reduce the size}} of the entrance hole and seal up cracks with mud. The {{red-breasted nuthatch}} makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer <b>resin</b> globules around the entrance, the male applying the <b>resin</b> outside and the female inside. The <b>resin</b> may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the <b>resin</b> by diving straight through the entrance hole). The white-breasted nuthatch smears blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.|$|E

5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the <b>resin</b> collected; the <b>resin</b> is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy <b>resin</b> and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{physical}} restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5mm thick) that {{were in danger of}} separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a polyvinylacetate <b>resin.</b> Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled.

The <b>resins</b> have been studied both bare and when impregnated with the solvent and their efficiency was seen to increase significantly upon impregnation. The overall efficiency of the <b>resins</b> {{was found to be}} pH dependent. It is also related to the level of impregnation of the <b>resins.</b> Recovery by the <b>resins</b> compares favourably with liquid/liquid solvent extraction using the same solvent. The overall capacity of the <b>resins</b> was estimated by determination of the maximum gold loading of the <b>resins.</b> Gold from the <b>resins</b> was eluted by washing with methanol and mass balances of gold approaching 100 % have been achieved. The effect of interferents in solution, in particular, excess thiourea and ferric and cupric ions was also investigated. Scanning electron micrographs and X-Ray fluorescence spectra of the bare and impregnated <b>resins</b> were obtained and the effect of sulphur formation on the <b>resins</b> was established...|$|R
5|$|Another {{possible}} way {{to separate the}} trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase.

The mendelevium separated by this method has the advantage of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the <b>resin</b> column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after fermium.|$|E

The most recent is the use of ion-exchange <b>resin.</b> Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is extractable. The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange <b>resin</b> in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process).
