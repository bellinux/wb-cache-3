2500|$|Soon {{after the}} 1967 war, Israel issued a {{military}} order {{stating that the}} Geneva Conventions applied to the recently occupied territories, but this order was rescinded a few months later. For a number of years, Israel argued on various grounds that the Geneva Conventions do not apply. [...] One is the Missing <b>Reversioner</b> theory which argued that the Geneva Conventions apply only to the sovereign territory of a High Contracting Party, and therefore do not apply since Jordan never exercised sovereignty over the region. However, that interpretation is not shared by the international community. The application of Geneva Convention to Occupied Palestinian Territories was further upheld by International Court of Justice, UN General Assembly, UN Security Council and the Israeli Supreme Court.|$|E

50|$|Financial and {{physical}} responsibility {{falls to the}} life tenant under the legal doctrine of waste, which prohibits life tenants from damaging or devaluing the asset. In short, as the life tenant's ownership is temporary, failing to maintain or reasonably protect the asset resulting in its diminution in value, or indeed, destruction constitutes a cause of action for the <b>reversioner.</b>|$|E
40|$|Professor Purdy {{takes an}} early American {{change in the}} common-law {{doctrine}} of waste - governing relations between tenants and <b>reversioners</b> (sometimes landlords, sometimes heirs of deceased owners) - as an occasion to compare two modes of explaining doctrinal change: one exclusively economic, the other embracing political and ideological {{as well as economic}} explanations of individual and institutional behavior. Professor Purdy concludes that the fullest and most convincing interpretation of waste doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s transformation from English to American common law emerges from a pluralist account. He insists, however, that economic explanation not only has a central place in doctrinal interpretation, but is enriched even on its own terms by the addition of plural elements. Early American courts moved the law governing tenants 2 ̆ 7 use of land from a bright-line rule to a fuzzy standard. Courts styled the change an effort to rationalize the law in light of the very different proportions of land, labor, and capital present in North America as against those prevailing in England. Curiously, however, basic economic analysis of the American doctrine suggests it was not a clear improvement as an efficiency-enhancing device. The doctrine emerged, moreover, in the context of quasi-feudal landlord-tenant relations in the manorial estates of the Hudson Valley, which were in many respects the bete noir of the broadly republican ethos then prevalent in American law and politics. By examining the context of the seminal case and the thought of one its deciding judges - New York 2 ̆ 7 s Chancellor James Kent - on the relationship of property law to republican society, Professor Purdy shows how the change would have seemed attractive {{from the point of view}} of creating a formally egalitarian free-market society. This interpretation is not so much at odds with a conventional economic explanation as it is illuminating of what market economics meant in early eighteenth-century America. The free market described a set of social relationships, regarded as the antithesis of feudal hierarchy, which legislators and jurists did not assume as given, but set about deliberately to create, always in the shadow of the feudal counterpoint...|$|R

50|$|D'Anglebert's {{career in}} Paris must have begun at the Jacobins church in Rue St. Honoré, {{where he was}} still organist in January 1660. In August 1660 he succeeded Henri Dumont as harpsichordist to Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, the King's younger brother. He kept the {{position}} until at least 1668, but in the meantime, in 1662, he bought the reversion of the post of harpsichordist from Chambonnières, who had been recently disgraced at the court; Chambonnières kept the salary, but D'Anglebert assumed the duties. He served as royal harpsichordist until his son Jean-Baptiste-Henry became his <b>reversioner</b> in 1674. After 1679 D'Anglebert served Dauphine Duchess Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria, who died in 1690. D'Anglebert died the following year, on 23 April. His only published work, Pièces de clavecin, appeared just two years before, in 1689. The rest of his music - mostly harpsichord works, but also five fugues and a quatuor for organ - survives in manuscripts.|$|E
40|$|The Australian law {{concerning}} {{real property}} {{is derived from}} the law of England. Ownership of land in England in the middle ages constituted the wealth of the country. Land included not only the surface of the property, but the owner of the soil was also the owner of everything "up to the sky and down to the centre of the earth". Due to the importance placed on the ownership of land, very little law was made in regards to personal property. The owners of land were the law makers and therefore the laws developed protected their interest in real property. Laws were developed to settle disputes as to title to chattels that tenants of the land owners had affixed to the land. As trade and commerce developed, the value of chattels was recognised and laws were developed in their protection. Despite this development, the classification of real and personal property is basically unchanged since feudal times. The unique ability of chattels to change from the status of personal property to real property has caused problems from the time the doctrine of fixtures was evolved - disputes as to priority to fixtures are an age old problem. Competing claims to fixtures arise in many relationships - lessor and lessee, vendor and purchaser of land, mortgagor and mortgagee, life tenant and <b>reversioner</b> and mortgagee and grantee under a bill of sale...|$|E
