2500|$|Thomson had {{an unusual}} but highly {{effective}} slinging delivery action {{that he learned}} from his father. In December 1975, during the second test match against the West Indies at the WACA, he was timed with a <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> of 160.45 km/h using highly accurate, high-speed Photo-Sonics cameras. The study {{was carried out by}} Tom Penrose and Brian Blanksby of the University of Western Australia, and Daryl Foster of the Secondary Teachers' College in Perth. Measurements were also made of three other fast bowlers, Dennis Lillee, Andy Roberts and Michael Holding, and the study is described in Dennis Lillee's book, The Art of Fast Bowling. Thomson's fastest delivery was significantly quicker than the next fastest bowler, Andy Roberts, whose fastest delivery was measured at 150.67 km/h. Another interesting finding from the study was the run-up speed of the bowlers. Thomson approached at 18.02 km/h, significantly slower than Holding (28.10 km/h), Roberts (28.78 km/h) and Lillee (33.57 km/h). When Thomson bowled one of his 160 km/h deliveries it is calculated that the ball took a mere 0.438 seconds from leaving the bowler's hand to reaching the bat. Studies have shown that it takes about 0.30 seconds for a batsman to see the ball, predict its path and decide on a stroke, and a further 0.30 seconds to perform the stroke. This suggests that a batsman would need to start his reaction time 0.162 seconds before Thomson released the ball, or start to play the stroke before knowing where the ball would pitch.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} significant relationships between selected anthropometric and kinematic variables and ball <b>release</b> <b>speed.</b> Nine collegiate fast-medium bowlers (mean ± s: age 21. 0 ± 0. 9 years, body mass 77. 2 ± 8. 1 kg, height 1. 83 ± 0. 1 m) were filmed and reconstructed three-dimensionally. Ball release speeds were measured by a previously validated SpeedchekTM Personal Sports Radar (Tribar Industries, Canada). Relationships between selected anthropometric variables and ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> and between kinematic variables and ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> were investigated using Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficients (r).

In pure hand shots, <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> angle and backspin are severely limited. All hand-forearm shot configurations are able to produce desired <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> angle and backspin.

40|$|The jump throw is {{the most}} applied {{throwing}} technique in team- handball (Wagner et al., 2008); however, a comprehensive analysis of 3 D-kinematics of the team-handball jump throw is lacking. Therefore, the purpose of our study was: 1) to measure differences in ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> in team- handball jump throw and anthropometric parameters between groups of different levels of performance and (2) to analyze upper body 3 D-kinematics (flexion/extension and rotation) to determine significant differences between these groups. Three-dimensional kinematic data was analyzed via the Vicon MX 13 motion capturing system (Vicon Peak, Oxford, UK) from 26 male team-handball players of different performance levels (mean age: 21. 2 ± 5. 0 years). The participants were instructed {{to throw the ball}} (IHF Size 3) onto a target at 8 m distance, and to hit the center of a square of 1 × 1 m at about eye level (1. 75 m), with maximum ball <b>release</b> <b>speed.</b> Significant differences between elite vs. low level players were found in the ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> (p < 0. 001), body height (p < 0. 05), body weight (p < 0. 05), maximal trunk internal rotation (p < 0. 05), trunk flexion (p < 0. 01) and forearm pronation (p < 0. 05) as well as trunk flexion (p < 0. 05) and shoulder internal rotation (p < 0. 001) angular velocity at ball release. Results of our study suggest that team-handball players who were taller and of greater body weight have the ability to achieve a higher ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> in the jump throw, and that an increase in trunk flexion and rotation angular velocity improve the performance in team-handball jump throw that should result in an increase of ball <b>release</b> <b>speed...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the release angle that maximises the distance attained {{in a long}} soccer throw-in. One male soccer player performed maximum-effort throws using release angles of between 10 and 60 degrees, and the throws were analysed using 2 -D video. The player's optimum release angle was calculated by substituting mathematical expressions for the measured relations between <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> release height, and release angle into the equations for the flight of a spherical projectile. We found that the musculoskeletal structure of the player's body had a strong influence on the optimum release angle. When using low release angles the player released the ball with a greater <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> and because the range of a projectile {{is strongly dependent on}} the <b>release</b> <b>speed,</b> this bias toward low release angles reduced the optimum release angle to about 30 degrees. Calculations showed that the distance of a throw may be increased by a few metres by launching the ball with a fast backspin, but the ball must be launched at a slightly lower release angle.

The fastest bowlers were also observed to exhibit larger amounts of upper trunk flexion up to ball release and to delay the onset of arm circumduction.

40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Journal of Sports Sciences on 28 / 01 / 2016, available online: [URL] study investigates how elbow hyperextension affects ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> in fast bowling. A two-segment planar computer simulation model comprising an upper arm and forearm + hand was customised to an elite fast bowler. A constant torque was applied at the shoulder and elbow hyperextension was represented using a damped linear torsional spring at the elbow. The magnitude of the constant shoulder torque and the torsional spring parameters were determined by concurrently matching three performances. Close agreement {{was found between the}} simulations and the performances with an average difference of 3. 8 %. The simulation model with these parameter values was then evaluated using one additional performance. Optimising ball speed by varying the torsional spring parameters found that elbow hyperextension increased ball <b>release</b> <b>speed.</b> Perturbing the elbow torsional spring stiffness indicated that the increase in ball <b>release</b> <b>speed</b> was governed by the magnitude of peak elbow hyperextension and the amount that the elbow recoils back towards a straight arm after reaching peak elbow hyperextension. This finding provides a clear understanding that a bowler who hyperextends at the elbow and recoils optimally will have an increase in ball speed compared to a similar bowler who cannot hyperextend. A fast bowler with 20 ° of elbow hyperextension and an optimal level of recoil will have increased ball speeds of around 5 % over a bowler without hyperextension...|$|E
