5|$|The {{electrons}} of an atom {{are attracted}} to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus {{are attracted to}} each other by a different force, the nuclear force, which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force <b>repelling</b> the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the <b>repelling</b> electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation.|$|E

5|$|After <b>repelling</b> a Covenant counterattack on the Forerunner facility, the Spirit of Fire {{travels to}} Arcadia, where the Covenant has begun raiding local cities and {{slaughtering}} civilians. Forge contacts the local Spartan special forces and assists with the evacuation process. The Covenant builds a giant energy shield {{to hide the}} construction of a gigantic Scarab super-weapon, but the UNSC forces use experimental equipment to break through. The Scarab is destroyed, but the Arbiter kidnaps Anders and escapes the planet.|$|E
5|$|After some {{territorial}} disputes, {{war broke}} out between Stefan Nemanja, Grand prince of Raška, {{and the city of}} Dubrovnik, at that time under Norman suzerainty. In 1185, Nemanja attacked the city and laid siege to it, but a Ragusan counter-attack drove Nemanja's forces back. According to chronicles from Dubrovnik, which are accepted by most historians, the siege ultimately failed. How much help Dubrovnik received from the Normans while <b>repelling</b> the siege is also not known exactly.|$|E
5|$|Beginning August 5, these {{divisions}} initiated numerous crossing {{attempts to}} assault the UN {{forces on the}} other side of the river in an attempt to capture Taegu and collapse the final UN defensive line. The U.S. forces were successful in <b>repelling</b> North Korean advances thanks to training and support, but forces in the South Korean sectors were not as successful. During this time, isolated reports and rumors of war crimes committed by both sides began to surface.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{some animals}} will avoid {{anything}} that has the odor of the urine of certain predators. Tiger urine is thus very effective at keeping away animals. Coyote urine has gained currency as a deer repellent. Fox urine is used to <b>repel</b> rabbits, groundhogs, woodchucks, squirrels and chipmunks. Bobcat urine <b>repels</b> moles, mice, voles and other rodents. Wolf urine is used to <b>repel</b> moose.|$|R
5|$|Fluorosurfactants {{are small}} organofluorine {{molecules}} used for <b>repelling</b> water and stains. Although expensive (comparable to pharmaceuticals at $200–2000 per kilogram), they yielded over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenues by 2006; Scotchgard alone generated over $300 million in 2000. Fluorosurfactants are a minority in the overall surfactant market, most of which is taken up by much cheaper hydrocarbon-based products. Applications in paints are burdened by compounding costs; this use was valued at only $100 million in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Like most Austrian generals of the French Revolutionary Wars, {{he joined}} the {{military}} as a young man, and served in the War of Bavarian Succession, in which he took part in its first action by successfully <b>repelling</b> a Prussian border raid, which earned him the admiration of the Empress Maria Theresa's son, Joseph.

The North Koreans, racked by logistical and manpower shortages, focused more heavily on their attacks against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain, as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River. 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18.|$|E
5|$|The Siamese {{success at}} <b>repelling</b> the Burmese {{would not be}} repeated. This first ever {{invasion}} gave the Burmese an important experience on fighting with Siamese.

The unrest in Burma delayed that next invasion for fifteen years, until the War of 1563 or the War of the White Elephants.|$|E
5|$|The conquests {{were made}} behind {{a mask of}} {{subordination}} to Rome. Zenobia issued coins {{in the name of}} Claudius' successor Aurelian, with Vaballathus depicted as king; since Aurelian was occupied with <b>repelling</b> insurgencies in Europe, he tolerated the Palmyrene coinage and encroachments. In late 271, Vaballathus and his mother assumed the titles of Augustus (emperor) and Augusta.|$|E

5|$|After Operation Save, the {{division}} remained relatively static {{for more than}} three weeks, mopping up and <b>repelling</b> local Partisan attacks. The Muslims were impatient to push further into Bosnia, but the reconnaissance battalion was heavily engaged on {{the division}}al western flank, attacking positions held by the Partisan 3rd Vojvodina Brigade of the 36th Vojvodina Division at Gornji Rahić on 26 March, killing 124 Partisans and capturing 14. The battalion captured several more Partisan positions in the following week. In early April, 200 Partisans of the 16th Muslim Brigade surrendered to the division. They were mostly former members of various Muslim militias who had been conscripted into the ranks of the Partisans.|$|E
5|$|In early 1916, UB-7 and UB-8 {{were still}} {{cruising}} in the Black Sea out of Varna. The Germans {{did not have}} good luck in the Black Sea, which was not a priority for them. The Bulgarians, who saw {{the value of the}} submarines in <b>repelling</b> Russian attacks, began negotiations to purchase UB-7 and UB-8. Bulgarian sailors practiced in the pair of boats and technicians were sent to Kiel for training at the German submarine school there. The transfer of UB-8 to the Bulgarian Navy took place on 25 May 1916, but for reasons unreported in sources, UB-7 remained under the German flag.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Georgi Sava Rakovski's revolutionary ideas, Levski {{left for}} the Serbian capital Belgrade {{during the spring of}} 1862. In Belgrade, Rakovski had been {{assembling}} the First Bulgarian Legion, a military detachment formed by Bulgarian volunteers and revolutionary workers seeking the overthrow of Ottoman rule. Abandoning his service as a monk, Levski enlisted as a volunteer. At the time, relations between the Serbs and their Ottoman suzerains were tense. During the Battle of Belgrade in which Turkish forces entered the city, Levski and the Legion distinguished themselves in <b>repelling</b> them.|$|E

5|$|Many cephalopods, {{including}} at least 70 genera of squid, are bioluminescent. Some squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescent chemical mixtures or bacterial slurries {{in the same way}} as many squid use ink. A cloud of luminescent material is expelled, distracting or <b>repelling</b> a potential predator, while the animal escapes to safety. The deep sea squid Octopoteuthis deletron may autotomise portions of its arms which are luminous and continue to twitch and flash, thus distracting a predator while the animal flees.|$|E
5|$|Science fiction films often depict humans {{successfully}} <b>repelling</b> alien invasions, {{but scientists}} more often take {{the view that}} an extraterrestrial civilization with sufficient power to reach the Earth {{would be able to}} destroy human civilization with minimal effort. Operations that are enormous on a human scale, such as destroying all major population centers on a planet, bombarding a planet with deadly neutron radiation, or even traveling to another planetary system in order to lay waste to it, may be important tools for a hostile and totalitarian civilization.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} (Anthus petrosus), or just rock pipit, is {{a species of}} small {{passerine}} bird that breeds in western Europe on rocky coasts. It has streaked greyish-brown upperparts and buff underparts, and is similar in appearance to other European pipits. There are three subspecies, of which only the Fennoscandian form is migratory, wintering in shoreline habitats further south in Europe. The Eurasian rock pipit is territorial {{at least in the}} breeding season, and year-round where it is resident. Males will sometimes enter an adjacent territory to assist the resident in <b>repelling</b> an intruder, behaviour only otherwise known from the African fiddler crab.|$|E
