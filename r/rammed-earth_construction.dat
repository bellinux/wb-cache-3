50|$|The Mud House is a {{historic}} home located at Penfield in Monroe County, New York. It is a -story, 24 by 38 ft rectangular earthen building with gable roof. It was constructed about 1836 of clay, puddled with straw, and then rammed into forms above a fieldstone foundation and is a rare surviving example of <b>rammed-earth</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|E
50|$|Soil is {{a widely}} available, inexpensive, and {{sustainable}} resource. Therefore, construction with rammed earth is very viable. Unskilled labour can {{do most of the}} necessary work. While the cost of rammed earth is low, <b>rammed-earth</b> <b>construction</b> without mechanical tools is very time-consuming and laborious; however, with a mechanical tamper and prefabricated formwork it can require only two or three days to construct the walls of a 200 to 220 m2 house.|$|E
40|$|The {{valleys of}} Southern Morocco are {{territorial}} corridors that are extremely rich in landscape and cultural terms but very fragile socially and economically. The 1000 kasbahs and ksars punctuating {{the length of}} the valleys have been the links in the chain providing a structure for these regions over the last three centuries. Their imposing presence means they have come to be seen as inseparable elements of the landscape and symbols of the region's identity. The abandonment and rapid deterioration of these <b>rammed-earth</b> <b>constructions</b> demonstrates the risk that this heritage could be lost right across the region. The proposal is to recover and restore some of these kasbahs to create a network of hotels which would also function as centres for the cultural interpretation of the region. The aim is to give the kasbahs back their role as structural elements for the territory, converting them into change agents for its economy and culture while simultaneously recovering their architectural heritage and landscape value.

50|$|In the United States, modern house-construction {{techniques}} include light-frame construction (in {{areas with}} access to supplies of wood) and adobe or sometimes <b>rammed-earth</b> <b>construction</b> (in arid regions with scarce wood-resources). Some areas use brick almost exclusively, and quarried stone has long provided walling. To some extent, aluminum and steel have displaced some traditional building materials. Increasingly popular alternative construction materials include insulating concrete forms (foam forms filled with concrete), structural insulated panels (foam panels faced with oriented strand board or fiber cement), and light-gauge steel framing and heavy-gauge steel framing.|$|E
50|$|The Ivanov-Rinov House is a {{historic}} house on Pierce Road in Dublin, New Hampshire. This two story house and studio was built over a twenty-year period beginning in 1937 by Gouri P. Ivanov-Rinov, an artist born in Russian Turkestan. The house features distinctive construction methods not usually found in New England, since {{they are based on}} those from his homeland. The main block is a square constructed of rammed earth, with a rear extension that is wood framed, which houses the kitchen and studio. The exterior is finished in a gray stucco-like material, with wood trim. The interior of the earth walls has recessed niches for the display of artwork. The <b>rammed-earth</b> <b>construction</b> {{is believed to be the}} only building of its type in New England.|$|E
5000|$|From the 1920s {{through the}} 1940s <b>rammed-earth</b> <b>construction</b> in the US was studied. South Dakota State College {{extensively}} researched and constructed almost one hundred weathering walls of rammed earth. For over 30 years the college investigated {{the use of}} paints and plasters in relation to colloids in soil. In 1945, Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina published {{the results of their}} research of rammed earth in a pamphlet titled [...] "Rammed Earth Building Construction". In 1936, on a homestead near Gardendale, Alabama, the United States Department of Agriculture constructed an experimental community of rammed-earth edifices with architect Thomas Hibben. The houses were inexpensively constructed and were sold to the public along with sufficient land for gardens and small plots for livestock. The project successfully provided valuable homes to low-income families.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} {{effectiveness}} of alkaline activation of low-calcium fly ash on the improvement of residual granitic soils to be used on <b>rammed-earth</b> <b>construction.</b> Different liquid:solid ratios, alkali concentrations and Na 2 O: ash ratios were tested. Effect of calcium hidroxide, sodium chloride and concrete superplasticiser is also reported. Compressive strength up to 7 days at 60 ÂºC was determined. Results show that, in terms of mechanical strength, there is an optimum value for the activator:solids ratio and the alkali concentration, and that {{a decrease in the}} Na 2 O:ash ratio results in strength increase. No improvement was observed with the sodium chloride or the superplasticiser, while the calcium produced only a short term increase in strength. SEM/EDS analysis were used to analyse microstructural development, showing that strength is fairly related to the Si:Al and Na:Si ratios...|$|E
