5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter <b>really</b> <b>what</b> you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E

Not knowing {{anyone else in the}} city, he and Jamie quickly develop a strong platonic friendship. One night, they get on the topic of sex and relationships. They {{come to the conclusion that}} sex should not come with so many emotional attachments. As they both feel the need for a physical connection, they agree to have sex without emotion or commitment. After several trysts together, Jamie comes to the realization that this is not <b>really</b> <b>what</b> she wants and she would like to start dating again. She tells Dylan that they need to stop.|$|E

It has been decided that neither of the new spouses will grant a divorce for a year, to give Amanda and Elyot time to confirm if this is <b>really</b> <b>what</b> they want. As tempers rise, Sybil and Victor begin to bicker with each other, defending their respective spouses.

500|$|William Moseley as Peter Pevensie. In a {{departure}} from the novel, Peter has a rivalry with Caspian. Moseley explained, [...] "Peter's got his own issues to deal with, and Caspian's got his own issues to deal with, and when neither is willing to compromise, there's bound to be friction. Peter came back to Narnia expecting to be king again and that everyone would do as he said, and Caspian is unwilling to let him take over, so that causes some of it. That's <b>really</b> <b>what</b> happens. And it's a lot about humility. I think they both have to learn a certain humility [...] and that's <b>really</b> <b>what</b> a great king needs is to be humble, to listen to his people, to be willing to compromise, and they start off as these sort of angry teenagers, and become kings at the end." [...] In real life, the two actors got on well together. Moseley also stated that he identified with Peter, having gone back to school between shooting both films. He trained for three months in New York City to improve his performance and his physicality.|$|E

The [...] "Super Duel" [...] mode was praised as a reasonably fun feature, although the gameplay was rated as [...] "sluggish".

[...] The character's perspective changed as the game itself changed from a real-time strategy game to a first-person shooter, but the Chief was always {{intended to be a}} soldier in the last part of a long and bitter war.
