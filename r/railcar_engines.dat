2500|$|The second {{stopping}} express {{was intended}} to be upgraded to a daily service by multiple unit operation of the second batch of twin set railcar approved in 1955, but cancelled in 1957 because mechanical troubles experienced {{in the first years of}} Fiat engined railcar operation, meant a dozen Fiats had to have new engines and crankcases fitted in 1957-8. [...] All the <b>railcar</b> <b>engines</b> needed to be rebuilt by Fiat/NZR personnel, raising costs and losses to the point where South Island express operations were consolidated, into a single daily express in 1956.|$|E
50|$|Basse und Selve (BuS) were German {{manufacturers}} of engines for automobiles, motorcycles, boats, aircraft and <b>railcars,</b> supplying <b>engines</b> for Selve cars {{built at the}} Selve Automobilwerke AG, but also various other {{manufacturers of}} automobiles and commercial vehicles, such as Beckmann, Mannesmann, and Heim. The Altena factory was founded in 1908 by Gustav Selve, employing 2,000 workers, with Dr. Walther von Selve taking over the firm {{on the death of}} Gustav Selve, his father.|$|R
50|$|The Aerowagon may be {{regarded}} as a precursor to the German Schienenzeppelin railcar, the American M-497 Black Beetle railcar and the later Soviet turbojet train, all three of them being experimental vehicles featuring the combination of <b>railcar</b> and aircraft <b>engine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{one-piece}} <b>railcars</b> have [...] <b>engines</b> and {{a maximum}} speed of 120 km/h. The train has 52 2nd class seats, eight 1st class 1 seats and 13 tip-up seats. Up to three cars can run together in multiple unit form.|$|R
50|$|The only binding {{conditions}} {{imposed on}} the builders were that the <b>railcar</b> was twin <b>engine,</b> that the mass adherent was not lower than 50% of the total, the engines were placed under the floor and which exceed the test UIC 100 hours.|$|R
50|$|In the openBVE railway simulator, {{there is}} a new network of Ljubljana Tramlink (Stadtbahn) system (at the bveroli.atw.hu page). The M1 line runs {{underground}} (under the downtown), the second line will run on the train track between Ljubljana Main Station and Vizmarje Station. The <b>railcars</b> are TW6000 <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Hungarian {{minister}} of trade, Lajos Láng, started {{a campaign for}} the development of self-propelled railcars in order to economize passenger transport on secondary railroads.The producers involved were Ganz & Cie., Weitzer Janos Rt., and Daimler-Benz, which fell out of competition. At first, two <b>railcars</b> with petrol <b>engine</b> and mechanical transmission were built, but they did not fit the demands.|$|R
5000|$|The {{emission}} standards {{are based on}} the engine classifications and vary in various jurisdictions. The main model regulations that are used by many countries are the United States Environmental Protection Agency through the section 213 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7547) and the directive of the European Commission (the [...] "mother Directive 97/68/EC, the amendments Directive 2002/88/EC, Directive 2004/26/EC, Directive 2006/105/EC, Directive 2011/88/EU and the last amendment Directive 2012/46/EU). The directives cover diesel engines, spark-ignition <b>engines,</b> constant-speed <b>engines,</b> <b>railcars,</b> locomotives and inland waterway vessels.|$|R
50|$|Various petrol engines were used, an 85 hp Napier {{engine was}} the first to be installed, but these were found unsatisfactory, so were {{replaced}} in 1904 by Wolseley engines. These flat-four engines produced 92 bhp at their normal rated speed of 400rpm, and well over 100 bhp when run at 480rpm. The cylinders were 8.5 inch diameter with 10 inch stroke. The engine had a 3-foot diameter flywheel, and was coupled directly to a Westinghouse multi-polar dynamo. A small dynamo driven by belt from the flywheel provided charge for the accumulators which enabled electric starting of the engine, lighting for the carriage, and the exciting current for the field coils in the main dynamo, controlled by rheostats {{at either end of the}} <b>railcar.</b> The <b>engine</b> speed could likewise be controlled via a throttle from either end of the railcar. The output from the main dynamo was sent to two electric motors, both mounted on the bogie underneath the engine room.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{turbojet}} railcar, SVL (High-speed Laboratory Railcar), {{was built}} in the USSR in 1970. The SVL was able to reach a speed of 250 km/h. This locomotive was built on a basis of the main <b>engine</b> <b>railcar</b> of ER22 electric multiple unit. It had a mass of 54.4 tonnes (including 7.4 tonnes of fuel) and was 28 m long. The power car was planned {{to be used as a}} part of [...] "Russian troika" [...] express. As of 2014 the train still exists in a dilapidated and unmaintained state, while a monument honoring the project was created in Tver.|$|R
50|$|The <b>railcar's</b> four-cylinder petrol <b>engine</b> {{and running}} gear were {{supplied}} by the English company MacEwan-Pratt and a 4.87 metre long wooden body that resembled a tram of that era was built by the Railways Department's Newmarket Workshops. The engine was located {{in the middle of}} the railcar with transmission provided by chain drive to just one of the two axles. A total of twelve people could be seated in the gas-illuminated passenger compartment, and driver's controls were at just one end despite the tram resemblance. On a trial run between Frankton and Putaruru in early 1913, it reached a speed of 50 km/h, at the time a fast speed for a rural line in New Zealand. Unfortunately it then broke down, and after attempts to fix it proved fruitless, research in different directions was undertaken. NZR dismantled it in May 1913.|$|R
40|$|While {{operating}} a locomotive or a <b>railcar</b> the <b>engine</b> drivers {{are exposed to}} the action of several simultaneous factors of disturbances from the traffic environment, and therefore their reliability and safety are reduced. The human-determined physical, sensor and cognitive factors are not only the attributes of the engine driver, but also include influences from the traffic environment, due to the interaction in the “engine driver – traffic means – traffic environment” system. Traffic environment is defined in such a way that, among other things, it includes also the working environment of the drivers cab and the recent traffic situation. The action of factors of temporary subjective disturbances and/or permanent psychological and physiological changes, depend not only on the individual endurance of engine drivers, but also significantly on the type of locomotive or railcar operated by the engine driver, {{as well as on the}} fact whether the traffic is intended for the transport of passengers and/or freight, or a shunting engine is involved. The ergo-assessment based on a survey of 50 respondents yielded the final results that are almost identical to the results of ergo-assessment obtained during the formation of the methodology of cognitive ergo-assessment on a sample of 31 respondents. In both cases the surveyed respondents were engine drivers who in practice operate all types of locomotives and railcars, who have acquired engine driver secondary school qualifications and have passed vocational testing for all types of locomotives and railcars. Systemic ergo-assessment of the intensity of the overall psychophysical effort is possible by introducing the index of importance which is used in case of all engine drivers to integrally and equally recognise also the influence of the percentage of occurrence of a certain factor of subjective disturbance and influence of the average assessment of the subjective disturbance intensity, thus allowing an insight into the structure of a system of simultaneous ergo-assessment factors and isolation of ten dominant ergo-assessment factors. Partial cognitive ergo-assessment and inter-comparison of the intensity of subjective disturbances have indicated the types of locomotives and/or railcar compositions in which the maximum partial intensity of disturbance is due to the following factors regarding the working ambient of the drivers cab: visibility, intensity of the difficulty of operation, and intensity of disturbance of the audible traffic noise.
