40|$|Cognitive {{interviewing}} is {{an important}} qualitative tool for the testing, development, and evaluation of survey questionnaires. Despite the widespread adoption of cognitive testing, there remain large variations {{in the manner in}} which specific procedures are implemented, and it is not clear from reports and publications that have utilized cognitive interviewing exactly what procedures have been used, as critical details are often missing. Especially for establishing the effectiveness of procedural variants, it is essential that cognitive interviewing reports contain a comprehensive description of the methods used. One approach to working toward more complete reporting would be to develop and adhere to a common framework for reporting these results. In this article we introduce the Cognitive Interviewing Reporting Framework (CIRF), which applies a checklist approach, and which is based on several existing checklists for <b>reviewing</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> qualitative research. We propose that researchers apply the CIRF in order to test its usability and to suggest potential adjustments. Over the longer term, the CIRF can be evaluated with respect to its utility in improving the quality of cognitive interviewing reports. (aut. ref. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGood {{progress}} has been made in reducing maternal deaths from 1990 – 2015 but accelerated progress is needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in ending preventable maternal deaths through a renewed focus on accountability and actions. This paper looks at how Maternal Death Surveillance and Response (MDSR) systems are strengthening response and accountability for better health outcomes by analyzing key findings from the WHO and UNFPA Global MDSR Implementation Survey across 62 countries. It examines two concrete examples from Nigeria and Ethiopia to demonstrate how findings can influence systematic changes in policy and practice. We found that a majority of countries have policies in place for maternal death notification and review, yet a gap remains when examining the steps beyond this, including <b>reviewing</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> at an aggregate level, disseminating findings and recommendations, and involving civil society and communities. As more countries move toward MDSR systems, it is important to continue monitoring the opportunities and barriers to full implementation, through quantitative means such as the Global MDSR Implementation Survey to assess country progress, but also through more qualitative approaches, such as case studies, to understand how countries respond to MDSR findings...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to design and build a DC to DC power converter that can operate in an oil well, while the oil well is being drilled. In order, for the power converter {{to be able to}} operate in such extreme conditions, all the semiconductors that will be used need to be made from silicon carbide or silicon insulator. 1. 2 Significance Currently oil companies are trying to implement a new procedure for oil well drilling. This new procedure is called the No Drilling Surprise (NDS); the NDS consists of three phases. The first phase is a pre drill plan, the second phase is monitoring the drilling operation, and the third is <b>reviewing</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> on how the drilling process could have been improved. The problem with implementing the NDS procedure is that the onsite engineers have no way of receiving “real time data ” from the oil well to assess potential surprises sooner. Without the “real time data ” from the oil well the chances of surprises are very high, thus raising the cost of drilling the oil well. 1. 3 Methods Due to the extreme conditions that the power converter will be exposed to,...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} color image analysis to automatically discriminate between oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon tissue in wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE). WCE uses ldquopill-camrdquo technology to recover color video imagery from the entire gastrointestinal tract. Accurately <b>reviewing</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> this data is {{a vital part of}} the examination, but it is tedious and time consuming. Automatic image analysis tools play an important role in supporting the clinician and speeding up this process. Our approach first divides the WCE image into subimages and rejects all subimages in which tissue is not clearly visible. We then create a feature vector combining color, texture, and motion information of the entire image and valid subimages. Color features are derived from hue saturation histograms, compressed using a hybrid transform, incorporating the discrete cosine transform and principal component analysis. A second feature combining color and texture information is derived using local binary patterns. The video is segmented into meaningful parts using support vector or multivariate Gaussian classifiers built within the framework of a hidden Markov model. We present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of this method...|$|E
40|$|Performance {{review of}} {{supervised}} staff involves reflective practice. As a genuine strategy to facilitate lifelong learning, reflective practices can incorporate a futures orientation {{in order to}} assess, plan, and implement improvements to an individual’s near- and far-future life, learning goals, and workplace performance. This can all be achieved within formal and informal mechanisms for <b>reviewing</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> on previous performance and planning for the immediate future workload and, where necessary, mechanisms for managing performance improvement can be introduced. Inherently, the short term nature of formalised performance review mechanisms do not facilitate good lifelong learning practice. It is through the more dynamic process of using a range of futures tools that formalised performance review mechanisms can promote a dialogue to explore the diverse potential of meeting current and near-future individual and organizational goals. This {{can be accomplished by}} understanding the past-present-future continuum; the nature of the plurality of the future – preferred, plausible, probable, or possible; and the exploration of the manner in which to achieve convergence to an achievable future. In this manner the incorporation of a futures orientation provides greater opportunity for staff and supervisor to explore and articulate organizational and individual goals and how to go about achieving them...|$|E

40|$|Background: Pranayama, {{a branch}} of yoga {{practice}} is extremely beneficial to mankind in maintaining sound {{physical and mental health}} and this article aims to attain an insight on the studies conducted on the effectiveness of Bhramari Pranayama (Bhr. P) on health. The studies done until May 2016 were found using Medline, Embase, Google scholar and manual search. Studies conducted on the health effectiveness of Bhr. P specifically were included on the basis of prisma guidelines. The data were defined by their objectives, methodology, study setting, findings, interventions done and implications suggested in the study. Methodological Quality Rating Scale (MQRS) and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) were used in <b>reviewing</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> results of the included studies. 6 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria; 2 studies were done on the cold pressor test, one on heart rate and BP, one on EEG changes, one each on the inhibitory response and tinnitus condition. In the included studies, the Bhr. P practices have shown para-sympathetic dominance. There are some encouraging effects of Bhr. P on various physiological systems. Methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated to be very low and none of them were RCTs. Yet the available studies are heterogeneous, dealing in different grounds and this heterogeneity serves as a resource for the limited scope of studies on Bhr. P. Therefore, further large-scale, properly designed, randomized trials of Bhr. P on various systems have to be done to justify these effects efficiently...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To provide {{recommendations}} for <b>reviewing</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> clinical in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) events in {{dogs and cats}} and to establish nonambiguous operational definitions for CPR terminology. DESIGN: Consensus guidelines. SETTING: International, academia, referral practice, general practice, and human medicine. METHODS: An international veterinary Utstein task force was convened in April 2013 in San Francisco to determine {{the scope of the}} project, the variables to be reported, their definitions, and a reporting template. Factors that were essential for meaningful data reporting and were amenable to accurate collection (ie, core variables) and additional variables useful for research projects and hypothesis generation (ie, supplemental variables) were defined. Consensus on each item was either achieved during that meeting or during the subsequent online modified Delphi process and dialogue between task force members. RESULTS: Variables were defined and categorized as hospital, animal, event (arrest), and outcome variables. This report recommends a template for standardized reporting of veterinary in-hospital CPR studies involving dogs or cats. Core elements include the suspected cause(s) and location of arrest, first rhythm identified, the occurrence of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) of more than 30 seconds (any ROSC) or more than 20 minutes (sustained ROSC), survival to discharge, and functional capacity at discharge. If CPR is discontinued or the patient is euthanized by owner request, a reason is reported. The task force suggests a case report form to be used for individual resuscitation events. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of these veterinary small animal CPR reporting guidelines will encourage and facilitate high-quality veterinary CPR research, improve data comparison between studies and across study sites, and serve as the foundation for veterinary CPR registries...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to conduct a survey and determine the barriers to implement performance-based management in pharmacies in Trinidad. PBM is defined as “a systematic approach to performance improvement through an on-going process of establishing strategic performance objectives, measuring performance, collecting, analyzing, <b>reviewing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> performance data, and using that data to drive performance improvement”(Performance Management Handbook). A questionnaire was conducted, with respect to the presence or absence of barriers to implementation of performance-based management at pharmacies along the East-West corridor of Trinidad. A twenty-two (22) question survey was administered to sixteen (16) pharmacies to be assessed. This region was chosen because of its close proximity and convenience. Fourteen (14) of the twenty-two (22) questions were based on a Likert-type scale, so that respondents were able to specify their level of agreement or disagreement of applicability on a symmetric “strongly agree - strongly disagree” scale for a series of statements based on the barriers of PBM implementation. Pharmacies were selected in a non-randomized manner. The SPSS statistical computer software was used to estimate a model that would best describe the barriers to the implementation of PBM in pharmacies of Trinidad. While Performance Based Management (PBM) is implemented in various pharmacies throughout Trinidad, it is usually found in those of larger companies with more staff employed and also with the infrastructure and funding available to support this type of management. Since most pharmacies operate with smaller staff, most aspects of PBM are not practised but this does not mean that the management are unaware of PBM. Some pharmacists and pharmacy owners have expressed intentions of employing PBM in the future and do follow some of its practices such as employee documentation and giving performance feedback. However with the many barriers to PBM existing, this type of management may seem too cumbersome for most businesses to implement fully. Although, PBM may not be fully implemented in pharmacies, (especially smaller businesses) if most pharmacy owners do not adapt to changes in the business settings they may not reap the full benefits that come with performance management...|$|E
