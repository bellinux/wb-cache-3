5000|$|The idea of fuzzy {{concepts}} {{has also}} been applied in the philosophical, sociological and linguistic analysis of human behaviour. In a 1973 paper, George Lakoff for example analyzed hedges {{in the interpretation of}} the meaning of categories. Charles Ragin and others have applied the idea to sociological analysis. For example, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis ("fsQCA") has been used by German researchers to study problems posed by ethnic diversity in Latin America. A concept may be deliberately created by sociologists as an ideal type to understand something imaginatively, without any strong claim that it is a [...] "true and complete description" [...] or a [...] "true and complete reflection" [...] of whatever is being conceptualized. [...] In a more general sociological or journalistic sense, a [...] "fuzzy concept" [...] has come to mean a concept which is meaningful but inexact, implying that it does not exhaustively or completely define the meaning of the phenomenon to which it refers - often because it is too abstract. In this context, it is said that fuzzy concepts [...] "lack clarity and are difficult to test or operationalize".

40|$|The study {{addresses}} {{a number of}} issues related to the effects of biasing semantic contexts on the processing of words with more than one meaning (homographs). Biasing contexts have been taken to either constrain “lexical access” to a contextually <b>relevant</b> <b>meaning</b> of a homograph (selective access), or to exert a selective effect only after access to all, or some subset of, the meanings of a homograph (multiple access). Recent findings based on the two-factor theory of attention (Posner 2 ̆ 6 Snyder, 1975 a) suggest that lexical access occurs in two stages, where the first stage involves automatic activation of all meanings and the second involves a rapid attentional selection of the contextually <b>relevant</b> <b>meaning.</b> A three word priming paradigm (Schvaneveldt, Meyer, 2 ̆ 6 Becker, 1976) was employed to test the stages hypothesis. Subjects were required to name only the final target word, and their reaction time was the dependent variable. The critical trials involved presentation of the two word primes, where the first prime was a word related to one meaning of the second prime, which was a homograph. The comparison of most interest was between targets that were semantically congruent or incongruent with the biased homograph (e. g., oar-row-PADDLE and oar-row-COLUMN, respectively). These conditions were compared to two baselines: One employing two neutral primes (e. g., xxxxx-xxxxx-PADDLE), and one employing the biased homograph followed by an unrelated target (e. g., oar-row-GREEN). The stimulus onset asynchtrony (SOA) of the homograph was varied, as well as the strategies that subjects were instructed to use in attending to the context stimuli. Some evidence was found for the stages view of ambiguity resolution: At brief SOAs, congruent and incongruent targets were facilitated, whereas at a longer SOA, facilitation was significantly reduced for incongruent targets. Attentional strategies had less effect than anticipated. Also, results with the neutral baseline were discrepant with earlier findings. Discussion focused on the research hypotheses and characteristics of the naming task that might account for the discrepant findings. A brief theoretical overview concluded...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} six {{experiments}} investigated whether inferences about contextually <b>relevant</b> aspects of <b>meaning</b> were encoded into memory during reading. In all the experiments, subjects studied short paragraphs.

For example, for a paragraph about searching for the correct color to paint a picture of a tomato, a <b>relevant</b> aspect of <b>meaning</b> would be that tomatoes are red. The test sentences were presented either immediately following the relevant paragraph or after a delay. With immediate testing, it was argued that the facilitation obtained in verification latency could result from processes occurring either when the context was read or when the test sentence was verified. With delayed testing, evidence was found to support the hypothesis that contextually <b>relevant</b> aspects of <b>meaning</b> are incorporated into the memory representation of the paragraph, but such evidence was obtained only when the retrieval environment encouraged the use of newly learned information in the decision process on the test sentence.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a problem called relevant subtask learning, {{a variant of}} multi-task learning. The goal {{is to build a}} classifier for a taskof-interest having too little data. We additionally have data for other tasks but only some are <b>relevant,</b> <b>meaning</b> that they contain samples classified {{in the same way as}} in the task-of-interest. The problem is how to utilize this “background data ” to improve the classifier in the task-ofinterest. We show how to solve the problem for logistic regression classifiers, and demonstrate that the solution works better than a comparable multi-task learning model. The key is to assume that data of all tasks are mixtures of relevant and irrelevant samples, and model the irrelevant part with a sufficiently flexible model such that it does not distort the model of relevant data. Key words: multi-task learning, partially relevant data, relevant subtask learning, transfer learning...|$|E
40|$|In this {{working paper}} we study some {{properties}} {{of a particular}} mapping in R n related to an optimization problem with one equality constraint. We motivate {{the definition of the}} relevant mapping starting from a portfolio selection problem, in which we minimize the risk of an investment (the variance of its return) with one equality constraint given by a fixed level of the return itself. The vector of the optimal portfolio is given by a particular mapping of the vector of returns and this mapping is taken into consideration. All the properties of this mapping may of course be considered in the more general context of an optimization problem with one equality contraint, but some of them may be reasonably extended in the further general case of more equality contraints. Although it has not been investigated in this work, some results may have a <b>relevant</b> <b>meaning</b> in explaining the relation between the vector of expected returns and the optimal portfolio...|$|E

Object {{of the study}} is the evaluative adjective assi, which is a common item of German adolescents' slang. Evaluative adjectives are said to be either polysemous or underspecified in meaning. The paper shows how interactionalists accomplish local meanings of the item by using it in certain sequential environments (story prefaces, comments and conclusions) which are related to genres of moral entertainment (e. g. gossip, fictitious stories). Locally relevant features of word-meaning (such as affective meaning, lexical opposition, exclusion of semantic features) are specified in more detail by interactionalists as they use specialized practices (such as expressive enactments, contrasting, blocking implications) which are realized by specific linguistic means (such as paraverbal strategies, negation, disjunctive connectives) ...|$|R
