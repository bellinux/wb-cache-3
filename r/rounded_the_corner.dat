60|$|A slender form <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> wall. It was Mescal. The white dog Wolf hung {{close by}} her side. Swiftly she reached Hare.|$|E
60|$|The car <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> Sam {{turned and}} waved a farewell. Mr and Mrs Ford, seated close {{together}} in the tonneau, did not even look round.|$|E
60|$|Then {{out into}} the driving snow, urging the horse that knew by {{instinct}} that something was amiss, and so mile after mile, till we <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> into the single street of the silent village.|$|E
50|$|Between 1990 and 1993, <b>Round</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corner</b> {{became a}} {{subsidiary}} of Good Times Restaurants, Inc., and was spun off into a separate company in 1995. <b>Round</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corner</b> filed for bankruptcy in 1996, with Good Times as the only secured creditor. By 2000, <b>the</b> last remaining <b>Round</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corner</b> restaurant, located in Aurora, Colorado, had been sold to an independent operator.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, <b>Round</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corner</b> Restaurants {{was started}} in Boulder, Colorado, and {{established}} a chain of gourmet, sit down hamburger restaurants. At its peak, <b>Round</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corner</b> had 30 restaurants in 4 states.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a curious}} effect about her as though {{when she went}} <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> she would become {{somebody}} else. And a curious recurrent feeling that <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> there was somebody else.|$|R
60|$|As Tansey <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> Captain Peek came out, {{and they}} met vis-a-vis. An exultant joy filled Tansey {{when he found}} himself {{sustaining}} the encounter with implicit courage. Peek, indeed! He raised his hand, and snapped his fingers loudly.|$|E
60|$|Upon a flat rock, so {{near the}} cascade that spray flew over him, sat another hunter. The roaring falls drowned all other sounds, yet the man roused from his dreamy {{contemplation of the}} {{waterfall}} when Joe <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b>|$|E
60|$|Yaqui {{turned the}} corner of a pocket in the lava wall. The file of white horses <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> after him. And Gale, coming last, saw the pale, glancing gleam of a pool of water {{beautiful}} in the twilight.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, {{some older}} players that used the Toe Kick method {{in the seventies}} {{argue that there is}} little {{difference}} between <b>Round</b> <b>The</b> <b>Corner</b> and Toe Kicking and that <b>Round</b> <b>The</b> <b>Corner</b> Kicking is just a fad.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> man coming <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> is a thief.|$|R
30|$|There is {{a garage}} <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> But itâ€™s closed.|$|R
6000|$|As we <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner,</b> {{one of them}} said, [...] "I could a' got in 'ere to- day. I come by at one o'clock, an' {{the line}} was beginnin' to form then--pets, that's what they are. They let 'm in, the same ones, night upon night." ...|$|E
6000|$|As I <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> nearest {{my hotel}} the Afrite coachman of the polychromatic, nonpareil coat seized me, swung open the dungeony {{door of his}} peripatetic sarcophagus, flirted his feather duster and began his ritual: [...] "Step right in, boss. Carriage is clean--jus' got back from a funeral. Fifty cents to any--" ...|$|E
60|$|As Clayton <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of {{the cabin}} to behold the animal disappearing within, it was also to see the ape-man seize the long tail in both hands, and, bracing himself with his feet against the side {{of the cabin}}, throw all his mighty {{strength}} into the effort to draw the beast out of the interior.|$|E

60|$|Twenty {{years had}} passed since Joey ran down the brae to play. Jess, his mother, shook her staff fondly at him. A cart rumbled by, the driver nodding on the shaft. It <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and stopped suddenly, and then a woman screamed. A handful of men carried Joey's dead body to his mother, and that was the tragedy of Jess's life.|$|E
6000|$|The {{last but}} one of the chained line was an old gray-headed man, {{followed}} by a slender graceful girl of some eighteen years old, and Amyas's heart yearned over them as they came up. Just as they passed, the foremost of the file had <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> above; there was a bustle, and a voice shouted, [...] "Halt, senors! there is a tree across the path!" ...|$|E
60|$|Unfortunate Suphy! {{she could}} not try the window this time, as it was broad daylight, and the Painted Lady took the letter from her at the door. She {{returned}} crestfallen, and for an hour nothing happened. The mole-catcher {{went off to the}} square, saying, despondently, that nothing would happen until he was round the corner. No sooner had he <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> than something did happen.|$|E
60|$|Stannard came <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner,</b> saw Deering, and stopped, rather quickly.|$|R

60|$|As he <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of {{the stable}} {{he heard the}} voice of a girl singing, and the effect of this upon him was greater than any uproar. It was uncanny. It made him wonder what kind of woman she could be who could carol {{in the midst of the}} band of raiders. She might be more {{dangerous}} than the men. She certainly added another complication to the situation.|$|E
60|$|As {{he stood}} before a window near a corner, his ears were assailed by a waxing clamour and commotion. He stood close {{to the window to}} allow passage to the cause of the hubbub--a {{procession}} of human beings, which <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and headed in his direction. He perceived a salient hue of blue and a glitter of brass about a central figure of dazzling white and silver, and a ragged wake of black, bobbing figures.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your hand," [...] whispered Tarzan. The men in {{the room}} beyond were {{battering}} at the door. With a sudden crash it fell splintering in, {{and at the same}} instant Abdul felt himself lifted like a feather onto the roof above. They were not a moment too soon, for as the men broke into the room which they had just quitted a dozen more <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> in the street below and came running to a spot beneath the girl's window.|$|E

60|$|The bedroom steward came <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> at that moment. I {{pointed to}} the dog.|$|R
60|$|My {{quotation}} {{was hardly}} {{out of my}} lips before we had <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> above the Convent; and a few yards further on could see across to Sanjowlie. In {{the centre of the}} level road stood the black and white liveries, the yellow-paneled 'rickshaw, and Mrs. Keith-Wessington. I pulled up, looked, rubbed my eyes, and, I believe must have said something. The next thing I knew was that I was lying face downward on the road with Kitty kneeling above me in tears.|$|E
60|$|Nobody but Freda {{knew about}} it. The poplar growth {{concealed}} {{the corner from}} sight, and everybody had quite forgotten poor, disreputable Jordan Slade's grave. At least, {{it seemed as if}} everybody had. But one evening, when Freda slipped down to the graveyard with a little can of water and <b>rounded</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the poplars, she saw a lady standing by the grave--a strange lady dressed in black, with the loveliest face Freda had ever seen, and tears in her eyes.|$|E
