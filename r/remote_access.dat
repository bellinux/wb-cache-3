40|$|Split-C is {{a single}} program, {{multiple}} data (SPMD) programming language. Split-C provides {{the ability to use}} a shared address space abstraction on a distributed shared memory (DSM) system, such as a network of workstations (NOW). The existing Split-C compiler translates all references to shared variables owned by another processor into network transactions. We implement SWCC-Split-C, a modified Split-C compiler which automatically caches <b>remote</b> <b>accesses</b> to avoid redundant network transactions. Our cache coherence system is implemented entirely in software. It uses a directory system and a simple MSI coherence protocol to provide cache coherence with blocks of fine granularity. We demonstrate significant improvements for programs with redundant <b>remote</b> memory <b>accesses,</b> and programs with spatial locality in <b>remote</b> <b>accesses.</b> Our SWCC-Split-C compiler is ideally suited to irregular applications with access patterns which are difficult to predict...|$|R
30|$|The {{procedure}} for obtaining data <b>access</b> via <b>remote</b> data <b>access</b> {{is comparable to}} scientific use files. Externals researchers have to send a form that includes information on the applicant, {{the aim of the}} analyses and their content to the FDZ which decides on the application. Compared to scientific use files, <b>remote</b> data <b>access</b> has the disadvantage that an external researcher is not able to directly control the procession of his syntax files with the data and to receive his outputs immediately. But <b>remote</b> data <b>access</b> provides access to less anonymized data, which may offer a higher research potential than scientific use files. Currently, the FDZ charges no fee for this form of data <b>access.</b> <b>Remote</b> data <b>access</b> is available for IAB Establishment Panel (IABB), the Establishment History Panel (BHP) and the IAB Employment Panel (BAP).

Synthesizing applications to these complex systems requires {{an effective and}} efficient approach to conduct data partitioning and storage assignment. In this paper, we formally describe this problem and show how it is {{much different from the}} traditional data partitioning problem for compilation to parallel processing systems. We present a data and iteration space partitioning solution that focuses on minimizing <b>remote</b> memory <b>accesses</b> or, equivalently, maximizing the local computation. Using the same code but different data partitionings, we can achieve up to 50 % increase in frequency, without increasing the number of cycles, by simply minimizing <b>remote</b> <b>accesses.</b> Other optimization techniques like memory port configuration, scalar replacement, prefetching and buffer insertion can further minimize <b>remote</b> <b>accesses</b> and lead to 46 x speedup in overall runtime. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} {{large-scale}} hierarchical and distributed shared memory systems hinges on {{our ability to}} reduce delays resulting from <b>remote</b> <b>accesses</b> to shared data. To facilitate this, we present a compile-time algorithm for analyzing programs with doall-style parallelism to determine when read and write accesses to shared data are redundant (unnecessary). Once identified, redundant <b>remote</b> <b>accesses</b> can be replaced by local accesses or eliminated entirely. This optimization improves program performance in two ways. First, slow memory accesses are replaced by faster ones. Second, the time to perform other <b>remote</b> memory <b>accesses</b> may be reduced {{as a result of}} the decreased traffic level. We also show how the information obtained through redundancy analysis can be used for other compiler optimizations such as prefetching and cache management.

40|$|Graph-structured {{analytics}} {{has been}} widely adopted {{in a number of}} big data applications such as social computation, web-search and recommendation systems. Though much prior research focuses on scaling graph-analytics on distributed environments, the strong desire on performance per core, dollar and joule has generated considerable interests of processing large-scale graphs on a single server-class machine, which may have several terabytes of RAM and 80 or more cores. However, prior graph-analytics systems are largely neutral to NUMA characteristics and thus have suboptimal performance. This paper presents a detailed study of NUMA characteristics and their impact on the efficiency of graph-analytics. Our study uncovers two insights: 1) either random or interleaved allocation of graph data will significantly hamper data locality and paral-lelism; 2) sequential inter-node (i. e., <b>remote)</b> memory <b>accesses</b> have much higher bandwidth than both intra- and inter-node ran-dom ones. Based on them, this paper describes Polymer, a NUMA-aware graph-analytics system on multicore with two key design decisions. First, Polymer differentially allocates and places topol-ogy data, application-defined data and mutable runtime states of a graph system according to their access patterns to minimize <b>remote</b> <b>accesses.</b> Second, for some remaining random accesses, Polymer carefully converts random <b>remote</b> <b>accesses</b> into sequential <b>remote</b> <b>accesses,</b> by using lightweight replication of vertices across NUMA nodes. To improve load balance and vertex convergence, Polymer is further built with a hierarchical barrier to boost parallelism and locality, an edge-oriented balanced partitioning for skewed graphs, and adaptive data structures according to the proportion of ac-tive vertices. A detailed evaluation on an 80 -core machine shows that Polymer often outperforms the state-of-the-art single-machine graph-analytics systems, including Ligra, X-Stream and Galois, for a set of popular real-world and synthetic graphs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} and evaluates a compiler {{transformation that}} improves {{the performance of}} parallel programs on Network-of-Workstation (NOW) sharedmemory multiprocessors.

Asynchronous prefetching of remote data is used to overlap non-local access latency with the execution of local-only iterations. Experimental evaluation of the transformation on a NOW multiprocessor indicates that it is generally effective in improving parallel execution time (up to 1. 9 times). The extent of the benefit is determined by three factors: the size of localonly computations, the significance of <b>remote</b> memory <b>access</b> latency, and {{the position of the}} iterations that <b>access</b> <b>remote</b> data in a parallel loop...|$|R
