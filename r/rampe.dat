30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, this is the first study to {{systematically}} assess the role of lithium maintenance treatment on calcium metabolism, including iPTH levels and 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol concentrations in patients with bipolar disorder. In our study, iPTH levels were significantly higher in patients with bipolar disorder undergoing psychopharmacological treatment that included lithium for at least 6 months (lithium group) compared to patients with bipolar disorder receiving psychopharmacological treatment that excluded lithium (non-lithium group). In line with this, group affiliation (lithium versus non-lithium) was the only variable explaining iPTH concentrations. Furthermore, none of our patients with iPTH concentrations above the reference range would have been detected using current screening recommendations (Livingstone and <b>Rampes</b> 2006; Saunders et al. 2009).|$|R

3000|$|Lithium {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used and most efficacious drugs in the {{different}} treatment phases of bipolar disorders (Severus et al. 2012). In particular, recent data clearly support lithium as the first-line treatment in long-term treatment of this disorder (Weisler et al. 2011; Geddes et al. 2010; Kessing et al. 2011). However, lithium is also known to be associated with a variety of side effects including weight gain, hypothyroidism, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (Livingstone and <b>Rampes</b> 2006). Furthermore, lithium is listed as one of the causes of primary hyperparathyroidism, a biochemical syndrome characterized by increased secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from one or more of the parathyroid glands (Sitges-Serra and Bergenfelz 2007; Broome and Solorzano 2011). Most cases are sporadic in nature and caused by a single adenoma (85 %– 95 %) or multiglandular disease (5 %– 10 %) (Sitges-Serra and Bergenfelz 2007). In case of lithium treatment, a decrease in parathyroid sensitivity to calcium has been suggested as the principal mechanism of action for the increased secretion of parathyroid hormone resulting in hypercalcemia, the biochemical hallmark of primary hyperparathyroidism (Haden et al. 1997). Consequently, monitoring calcium levels before initiating lithium therapy and every 6 months thereafter has been suggested as the primary screening parameter for lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism (Livingstone and <b>Rampes</b> 2006; Broome and Solorzano 2011). If calcium levels are found to be elevated, measuring intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels has been recommended as the next step (Livingstone and <b>Rampes</b> 2006). According to the ‘International Group for The Study of Lithium Treated Patients’[*], between 10 % and 42 % of patients on lithium therapy develop hypercalcemia and up to 29 % develop hyperparathyroidism (Schleicher and Kampf 2013). The available data show that most of the studies conducted so far are case control studies, and none of the studies focus exclusively on patients with bipolar disorders in the test or control groups (Saunders et al. 2009). In general, the number of participants included in these studies is relatively small, and only a few of these studies employed parathyroid test systems complying with today's quality standards (Souberbielle et al. 2006). In addition, one of the more recent studies suggests that following 6 months of lithium treatment, patients have significantly increased parathyroid hormone concentrations without an increase in serum calcium levels (Mak et al. 1998). This ‘normocalcemic’ subtype of lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism will consequently remain unrecognized if calcium is used as the sole and primary screening instrument as is currently recommended. Interestingly, in a community-based cohort of elderly men, higher (and high normal) plasma PTH levels were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality in the absence of hypercalcemia (Hagstrom et al. 2009). Missing these cases of isolated higher parathyroid levels is of particular concern as bipolar disorder per se is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (Fiedorowicz et al. 2008). Furthermore, additional studies suggest an association between elevated parathyroid hormone levels and cognitive deficits in the absence of hypercalcemia (Jorde et al. 2006; Roman et al. 2005). Therefore, we set out to answer the following hypotheses: [...]...|$|R

If wheels are used there are two alternativs concerning the moving process: Moving in one direction (concentric running) or in two direction ({{running up and down}}). Out of seven different possibilities two solution drafts were worked out using criterions. These two solutions were developed in greater detail: A plane, oval concentric track resp. a straight track with two ramps. Between the two ramps a bogie is running up and down. The first proposal represents a horizontal layed oval track with very small return curves and sufficient long stright test sections. By the second proposal a bogie is running up and down on a test-section. The acceleration and delay followed on the two <b>rampes</b> at both sides of the track. Before a test the bogie is pulled up a ramp in a height for a specific velocity. Disconnecting the bogie the test stars.

40|$|Wormlike {{micelles}} are viscoelastic fluids {{that present}} an intermediate behavior between solids and ordinary liquids {{since they are}} elastic at short time scales but flow easily at large time scales. In opposition to Newtonian fluids, which have constant viscosity, these fluids usually exhibit a non-Newtonian response with a rate-dependent shear viscosity. Wall-bounded oscillatory flows of Newtonian and complex fluids are found in many practical situations. Oscillatory pipe flows are especially important in physiology {{in connection with the}} circulatory and respiratory systems of human beings, as well as in industrial processes such as fluid pumping, secondary oil recovery or filtration, and in acoustics. Pulsating flows are of particular interest also in the rheological characterization of complex fluids. We analyze the laminar oscillatory flow of viscoelastic fluids using the Maxwell and Oldroyd-B models. We have shown that in wall-bounded oscillatory flows of viscoelastic fluids the two characteristic lengths of the Ferry waves, the damping length and wavelength, together with the characteristic separation of the walls, define all the flow properties for fluid models with a linear shear-stress equation in unidirectional flow. In wall-bounded settings there exists the possibility that shear waves generated at different locations superpose themselves before decaying so that the shear waves interfere, giving rise to a resonant flow at well defined frequencies of driving. The theoretical predictions obtained for the laminar velocity profiles are validated by carrying out time-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments in a vertical pipe at small driving amplitudes. The oscillatory pipe flow has been investigated in the whole range of experimentally accessible driving frequencies and amplitudes, and classified in three main flow regimes: laminar, vortical, and non-axisymmetric vortical. By ramping up and down the driving amplitude at constant frequency {{we have been able to}} characterize the transition from laminar to more complex flows, under controlled driving conditions. The first hydrodynamic instability occurs when the laminar base flow becomes unstable against the formation of axisymmetric toroidal vortices that appear distributed along the cylinder. The calculation of root-mean-square fluctuations in the vertical direction, of the vertical and radial components of the velocity (averaged in time or over the tube diameter) has allowed to determine the critical amplitude at which the instability sets in with high accuracy. In the vortical flow an abrupt increase of the fluctuations is observed, that accounts for the loss of the vertical translational symmetry and the formation of vortices in the flow. This transition exhibits hysteresis when the driving amplitude is ramped up and down, which makes us presume that the bifurcation from the laminar flow has a subcritical nature. A second hydrodynamic instability occurs when the vortical flow loses the axial symmetry. In this flow regime the vortices are heavily distorted and no longer axisymmetric. The velocity and vorticity maps of the vortical flow measured in a meridional plane of the tube appear periodic in time, on time scales comparable to the driving period. Interestingly, the vortex formation is favored in the acceleration phases of the piston oscillation. Besides, we have uncovered a spatio-temporal dynamics on long time scales (much larger than the relaxation time of the fluid) that substantially modifies the flow organization. This slow dynamics is more effective in the bottom half of the cylinder, specially next to the driving piston. A global inspection of the vortical flow along the tube length reveals that the instability takes place earlier in the bottom part of the tube, in the vicinity of the driving piston. At increasing the driving amplitude the boundary between laminar and vortical flow progressively raises towards the top regions. And above a critical driving amplitude the entire fluid flow is vortical. The mechanism triggering the hydrodynamic instability from the laminar to the axisymmetric vortical flow is not yet clear. L'objectiu d'aquesta Tesi és estudiar el flux oscil•latori vertical en fluids micel•lars. Els fluids micel•lars són fluids complexos amb propietats viscoelàstiques, de manera que mostren un comportament intermedi entre els sòlids i els líquids: són elàstics a escales de temps curtes però flueixen a escales de temps més llargues. En contraposició als fluids Newtonians, que tenen una viscositat constant, els fluids complexos mostren un comportament no-Newtonià, amb una viscositat que depèn del ritme de deformació. El fluxos oscil•latoris de fluids Newtonians o complexos en geometries confinades són especialment importants en fisiologia, en relació amb el sistema circulatori i respiratori d'éssers humans, i també en processos industrials com el bombejat de fluids, l'extracció de petroli, i en particular són interessants en la caracterització reològica de fluids complexos. Primer estudiem el flux oscil•latori des d'una perspectiva teòrica i analitzem el flux laminar de fluids viscoelàstics utilitzant els models de Maxwell i Oldroyd-B en un tub vertical. Hem mostrat que en fluxos confinats existeix la possibilitat que les ones de cisalla generades a les diferents parets se sobreposin abans d'esmorteir-se i que eventualment donin lloc a un fenomen de ressonància. Les prediccions teòriques obtingudes pel flux laminar són validades duent a terme experiments de Velocimetria d'Imatges de Partícules (PIV) en un tub vertical, per amplituds petites del forçament oscil•latori. Quan s'incrementa l'amplitud de l'oscil•lació el flux laminar evoluciona cap a fluxos que presenten una dependència espai-temporal més complexa. Fent <b>rampes</b> d'amplitud creixent a una freqüència fixada hem pogut caracteritzar experimentalment la transició del flux laminar a aquests fluxos més complexos, sota condicions de forçament ben controlades. La primera inestabilitat apareix quan el flux laminar esdevé inestable amb la corresponent formació d'anells de vorticitat apilats al llarg del tub. Es manifesta una segona inestabilitat per amplituds del forçament més grans, per la qual el flux vortical perd la simetria axial. En aquest nou règim els vòrtex estan fortament distorsionats i no són axisimètrics.

40|$|Dear Editor,&# 13; The homeopathic {{scientific}} model suffers constant criticism due {{to employ}} different assumptions and antagonistic to conventional scientific model, despite constantly develop studies confirming their premises [1 - 3]. The preferred {{target of the}} critics and skeptics rests {{on the principle of}} similitude curative (‘like cures like’) and the use of ultra-high dilutions (dynamized medicines). &# 13; While the principle of similitude is scientifically grounded in the rebound effect (paradoxical reaction) of conventional drugs [4, 5], being recently proposed its therapeutic application by modern pharmacology (‘paradoxical pharmacology’) [6 - 8], several studies show clinical, biological and physical-chemistry activities of ultra-high dilutions in experimental models [9]. &# 13; Despite these evidences, many skeptics questioning the ‘plausibility’ of the homeopathic model. Disregarding the biological effect of the homeopathic medicines, they gathered in public squares from different countries with the purpose of ingesting large doses of these ‘implausible’ ultra-high diluted drugs and show that nothing will happen, because they would not have the power to cause adverse events as the conventional drugs. Although they have not notified any disorder after this massive ingestion of dynamized homeopathic medicines, a recent systematic review suggests that they must have suffered serious consequences, as we have suggested in the past. [10]&# 13; In order to counteract the widespread idea that homeopathy ‘is safe to use’, Posadzki et al. [11] conducted a systematic review to critically evaluate the evidence regarding the adverse effects (AEs) of homeopathy described in published case reports and case series. In a total of 38 reports analyzed, 30 pertained to direct AEs of homeopathic medicines encompassing 1142 patients submitted to various medicines and forms of treatment (mostly, complex homeopathic medicines in low potencies). Reporting that “in 94. 7 % of cases the potencies were described as below of the 12 ª Centesimal, the point beyond which the likelihood of a single molecule being present in the remedy approaches zero”, the authors claim that “in the majority of cases, the possible mechanism of action involved allergic reactions or ingestion of toxic substances”. With this approach, the authors seek to dismiss the biological effects of ultra-high dilutions, because if they cause AEs would be confirming the plausibility of its possible therapeutic effects. However, toxicological tests are required to affirm that AEs are a consequence of toxic (allergic) effects of the substances or of ‘imponderable’ effects of ultra-high dilutions. &# 13; In view of the recent report cited in the review [12] in which a complex homeopathic medicine indicated for treating infant colic (Gali-col Baby, GCB) caused apparent life-threatening events (ALTEs were described by the National Institutes of Health consensus group in 1986 as “an episode that is frightening to the observer and that is characterized by some combination of apnea (central or occasionally obstructive), color change (usually cyanotic or pallid but occasionally erythematous or plethoric), a marked change in muscle tone (usually marked limpness), choking or gagging” [13]) in consequence of the ‘toxicity of active ingredients’ (Citrullus colocynthis, Matricaria chamomilla, Bryonia alba, Nux vomica, Veratrum album, Magnesia phosphorica and Cuprum metallicum at potencies between 4 C and 5 C), Oberbaum et al. [14] performed a toxicological study of these components showing that “doses ingested in the GCB series were 10 - 13 orders of magnitude smaller than those reported to cause toxic reactions in humans” and that “there was poor correlation between symptoms with GCB and toxic profiles of the components”. As alternative explanation, they suggest that “four components (Veratrum album, Cuprum metallicum, Bryonia alba and Matricaria chamomilla) have an intermediate to high propensity to produce {{at least one of the}} five symptoms that define ALTE, when given in homeopathic dilutions. Two of these (Veratrum album and Cuprum metallicum) have an intermediate-to-high propensity to produce three of the four possible ALTE symptoms”. The authors conclude that “it is unlikely that the ALTE following ingestion of GCB was a toxic reaction to any of the drug’s component”, proposing the ‘homeopathic theory’ (pathogenetic manifestations) [15] as explanation for this linkage. &# 13; In view of these results, it can be inferred that AEs caused by homeopathic medicines at potencies ≥ 6 C ‘are more closely related to the imponderable effects of ultra-high dilutions than the toxic (allergic) effects of substances’. Accordingly, other case reports cited in that review described serious AEs with potencies of this magnitude, including the occurrence of ‘drug rash with eosinophilia and severe pulmonary involvement’ after using Sedativ PC (complex homeopathic medicine with 6 ingredients in 6 CH) [16], and the occurrence of ‘heart disease and bladder cancer’ with a complex homeopathic medicine in very high potencies (Aconitum napellus, Barytacarbonica, Cantharis vesicatoria, Gambogia, Pulsatilla nigricans and Rhus toxicodendron at 1000 c, M or 10 M potencies) [17], discarding any influence of ‘toxicity of substances’. &# 13; Similarly, in a systematic review on information regarding adverse effects of homeopathic medicines including 19 reports of clinical trials, 19 case (or case series) reports and 15 homeopathic pathogenetic trials, Dantas and <b>Rampes</b> [18] concluded that “the mean incidence of AEs of homeopathic medicines (ultra-high dilutions) was greater than placebo (9. 4 / 6. 1) in controlled clinical trials”, including mostly headaches, tiredness, skin eruptions, dizziness, bowel dysfunction such as diarrhea or loose stools and, more frequently, aggravations of symptoms following the administration of homeopathic medicines. &# 13; Countering the false adage that “if homeopathic medicines do not do well, evil also do not do”, the evidence of the manifestations of serious AEs with the inappropriate use of complex homeopathic medicines and/or very low potencies are an alert to the need to achieve a ‘good homeopathic clinical practice’, in conformity with the fundamentals of ‘therapeutic similitude’ according to the ‘pathogenetic experimentation’ and the ‘individualized medicines’. On the other hand, allows observation of biological effect of ultra-high diluted substances, reiterating the scientific validity of the use of the ‘dynamized medicines’...|$|R

L’efficience d’utilisation de l’eau est faible pendant le cycle d’installation, optimale pendant les trois cycles 2, 3 et 4 et diminue au dernier cycle avec le stress hydrique. L’EUE globale du bersim déterminée sur toute la période de culture (pente de la droite de régression) est de 3, 37 kg. m- 3. Le coefficient de réponse du rendement du bersim à l’eau est de 1, 11. L’ETc déterminée moyennant un lysimètre à drainage est 520 mm. Les valeurs de Kc ont été estimées pour chaque cycle pour les trois phases : initiale, développement (valeur médiane) et mi-saison. Le rendement moyen maximal obtenu sous le goutte à goutte est de 15, 7 t/ha et a été obtenu avec un apport en eau de 411 mm ce qui a permis une économie d’eau de 57 % par rapport au gravitaire. La comparaison du comportement de six variétés de luzerne les plus pratiquées dans le périmètre irrigué de Tadla montre que la variété « Super Siriver » suivie de « Trifecta » ont des potentialités de production très élevées avec des meilleures capacités de tolérance du stress hydrique. Le rendement annuel maximal obtenu pour la luzerne est de 24, 2 t. ha- 1. La contribution des cycles de printemps au rendement total annuel varie de 55 % sous T 1 (100 % ETc) à 65 % sous T 4 (40 % ETc). Les rendements de la luzerne dépendent en plus des quantités d’eau apportées de l’emplacement des apports à l’intérieur d’un cycle. L’efficience d’utilisation de l’eau varie d’un cycle à l’autre et d’une saison à l’autre. La valeur maximale est de 2, 57 kg. m- 3 et obtenue au printemps 2011 alors que la faible valeur est de 0, 64 kg. m- 3 qui est obtenue en hiver 2010. L’EUE diminue avec le stress hydrique avec des valeurs moyennes de 1, 83, 1, 67, 1, 54 et 1, 23 kg. m- 3 sous T 1, T 2, T 3 et T 4 respectivement. Le coefficient de réponse de rendement à l’eau (Ky) de la luzerne est de 0, 92. La détermination des besoins en eau de la luzerne a été réalisée sur la base des calendriers des cycles de la culture durant les deux campagnes 2010 et 2011. Les valeurs trouvées sous irrigation gravitaire sont de 1388 et 1364 mm pour les deux campagnes respectivement. L’irrigation localisée permet de réaliser des rendements similaires à l’irrigation gravitaire avec moins d’eau et plus d’efficience agronomique. Les apports en eau effectivement réalisés sous le régime T 1 avec l’écartement entre <b>rampes</b> de 50 cm sont inférieurs au besoin net de la culture d’environ 7 % et 18 % en 2010 et 2011 respectivement. Sous le même régime en irrigation gravitaire, les besoins sont dépassés de 16 % et 21 % en 2010 et 2011 respectivement. Deux modèles de cultures, PILOTE et CropSyst, avaient été retenus pour être testés sur leurs aptitudes à simuler la croissance et les rendements des trois cultures étudiés sous les conditions édapho-climatiques de Tadla. Sur le maïs, les deux modèles ont simulé correctement la croissance et le développement de cette culture sous des régimes hydriques variés. Les paramètres des deux modèles se sont montrés validés et efficaces pour la simulation de la biomasse, le LAI et le stock hydrique. Bien que PILOTE nécessite moins de paramètres et de données que CropSyst, il s'avère être souvent plus performant dans la simulation de la biomasse du maïs et du bilan hydrique. Concernant le bersim, les prédictions de la biomasse par CropSyst semblent être plus précises que celles du modèle PILOTE qui est à son tour meilleur {{au niveau de}} la prédiction du stock hydrique sur la tranche du sol exploitée par les racines (0 - 80 cm). Le modèle CropSyst a été retenu pour tester la possibilité de simuler la rotation bersim-maïs ensilage vu sa facilité d’intégrer des données climatiques journalières de plusieurs années. Les résultats montrent que ce modèle simule correctement l’évolution de la biomasse et les rendements des deux cultures considérées en rotation durant trois ans. La modélisation de la croissance et la production de la luzerne est réalisée pour les deux modèles en dehors de l’année d’installation de la culture. A l’issue de la calibration et de la validation réalisées, le modèle CropSyst simule convenablement la biomasse et le stock hydrique sur tous les régimes hydriques étudiés alors que les meilleures simulations de ces sorties par PILOTE se sont limitées au traitement non stressant T 1. Bien que le modèle CropSyst prenne en considération plusieurs paramètres dans la simulation de la croissance de la luzerne, leurs simplifications (valeurs uniques) réduisent ses performances surtout en situation de stress hydrique accentuée. Le peu de paramètre pris en considération dans le modèle PILOTE rend difficile sa validation pour une culture pérenne telle que la luzerne dans des situations variables. Le modèle CropSyst a été retenu pour évaluer les pratiques d’irrigation des agriculteurs et élaborer des scénarios virtuels d’irrigation pour les trois cultures étudiées. L’évaluation des scénarios virtuels élaborés montre que pour la luzerne, l’application d’une dose d’irrigation de 1600 mm selon un scénario qui prévoit l’application de 14 irrigations réparties en six arrosages durant le printemps, six en été, un en automne et un autre en début d’hiver permet de maximiser l’efficience de l’eau d’irrigation (EEI) (1, 21 kg/m 3) et de réaliser un rendement de 23, 1 t/ha (soit 95 % du potentiel). Sur le maïs, l’application d’une dose de 648 mm selon la combinaison [2 en phase initiale (au semis), 2 en phase linéaire et 2 en étape finale] permet d’atteindre le double objectif de réaliser un rendement élevé et garantir une meilleure valorisation de l’eau. Concernant le bersim, les résultats de simulation confirment que l’adoption du scénario qui prévoit l’application de 625 mm en 7 irrigations (3 en automne, 2 en hiver et 2 au printemps) permet de réaliser un rendement de 14, 1 t/ha qui représente 94 % du potentiel de la variété 6454. Ce scénario permet la meilleure efficience de l’eau d’irrigation (1, 24 kg/m 3) et occasionne de faibles pertes par drainage estimées à environ 17 % des apports en eau. La comparaison des deux systèmes de cultures représentés par la luzerne et la rotation maïs ensilage-bersim montre que la rotation valorise mieux l’eau et mobilise moins d’eau que la luzerne qui se distingue par sa rentabilité économique. Ainsi, le couplage des résultats de trois années d’expérimentations "in situ" (2008 à 2011) à ceux du calage, de la validation et des simulations de scénarios par les deux modèles CropSyst et PILOTE s'est révélé d’un grand intérêt pour l’amélioration de la conduite de l’irrigation des fourrages dans le périmètre irrigué de Tadla au Maroc...|$|R

It kept flushing through the present—very much as if I had had my small secret for making it. I could turn on my finger the magic ring—it was strange how slight a thing, a mere handful of pages of light persistent prose, could act as that talisman. So, at all events, I like to date, and essentially to synchronise, these sincere little studies in general.

An old-world nook of one’s youth was so named, a scrap of the lakeside fringe of ancient Geneva, now practically quite reformed and improved away. The Pension Beaurepas, across the years, looks to me prodigiously archaic and incredibly quaint; I ask myself why, at the time, I so wasted the precious treasure of a sense that absolutely primitive pre-revolutionary “Europe” had never really been swept out of its cupboards, shaken out of its curtains, thumped out of its mattresses. The echoes of the eighteenth century, to go no further back, must have been thick on its rather greasy stone staircase, up down which, unconscious of the character of the fine old wrought-iron <b>rampe,</b> as of most other things in the world besides, Mr. and Mrs. and Miss Ruck, to speak only of them, used mournfully to straggle.

All these movements or gestures are explicable, as I believe, from their standing in complete antithesis to those naturally assumed by a savage dog under a directly opposite state of mind. When a man merely speaks to, or just notices, his dog,we see the last vestige of these movements in a slight wag of the tail, without any other movement of the body, and without even the ears being lowered. Dogs also exhibit their affection by desiring to rub against their masters, and to be rubbed or patted by them. Gratiolet explains the above gestures of affection in the following manner: and the reader can judge whether the explanation appears satisfactory. Speaking of animals in general, including the dog, he says,[2] [...] "C'est toujours la partie la plus sensible de leurs corps qui recherche les caresses ou les donne. Lorsque toute la longueur des flancs et du corps est sensible, l'animal serpente et <b>rampe</b> sous les caresses; et ces ondulations se propageant le long des muscles analogues des segments jusqu'aux extremites de la colonne vertebrale, la queue se ploie et s'agite." [...] Further on, he adds, that dogs, when feeling affectionate, lower their ears in order to exclude all sounds, so that their whole attention may be concentrated on the caresses of their master! Dogs have another and striking way of exhibiting their affection, namely, by licking the hands or faces of their masters. They sometimes lick other dogs, and then it is always their chops. I have also seen dogs licking cats with whom they were friends. This habit probably originated in the females carefully licking their puppies--the dearest object of their love--for the sake of cleansing them. They also often give their puppies, after a short absence, a few cursory licks, apparently from affection. Thus the habit will have become associated with the emotion of love, however it may afterwards be aroused. It is now so firmly inherited or innate, That it is transmitted equally to both sexes. A female terrier of mine lately had her puppies destroyed, and though at all times a very affectionate creature, I was much struck with {{the manner in which}} she then tried to satisfy her instinctive maternal love by expending it on me; and her desire to lick my hands rose to an insatiable passion. [1] `De la Physionomie,' 1865, pp. 187, 218.The same principle probably explains why dogs, when feeling affectionate, like rubbing against their masters and being rubbed or patted by them, for from the nursing of their puppies, contact with a beloved object has become firmly associated in their minds with the emotion of love. The feeling of affection of a dog towards his master is combined with a strong sense of submission, which is akin to fear. Hence dogs not only lower their bodies and crouch a little as they approach their masters, but sometimes throw themselves on the ground with their bellies upwards. This is a movement as completely opposite as is possible to any show of resistance. I formerly possessed a large dog who was not at all afraid to fight with other dogs; but a wolf-like shepherd-dog in the neighbourhood, though not ferocious and not so powerful as my dog, had a strange influence over him. When they met on the road, my dog used to run to meet him, with his tail partly tucked in between his legs and hair not erected; and then be would throw himself on the ground, belly upwards. By this action he seemed to say more plainly than by words, [...] "Behold, I am your slave." [...] A pleasurable and excited state of mind, associated with affection, is exhibited by some dogs in a very peculiar manner, namely, by grinning. This was noticed long ago by Somerville, who says, And with a courtly grin, the fawning bound Salutes thee cow'ring, his wide op'ning nose Upward he curls, and his large sloe-back eyes Melt in soft blandishments, and humble joy.' The Chase, book i.Sir W. Scott's famous Scotch greyhound, Maida, had this habit, and it is common with terriers. I have also seen it in a Spitz and in a sheep-dog. Mr. Riviere, who has particularly attended to this expression, informs me that it is rarely displayed in a perfect manner, but is quite common in a lesser degree. The upper lip during the act of grinning is retracted, as in snarling, so that the canines are exposed, and the ears are drawn backwards; but the general {{appearance of}} the animal clearly shows that anger is not felt. Sir C. Bell[3] remarks [...] "Dogs, in their expression of fondness, have a slight eversion of the lips, and grin and sniff amidst their gambols, in a way that resembles laughter." [...] Some persons speak of the grin as a smile, but if it had been really a smile, we should see a similar, though more pronounced, movement of the lips and ears, when dogs utter their bark of joy; {{but this is not the}} case, although a bark of joy often follows a grin. On the other hand, dogs, when playing with their comrades or masters, almost always pretend to bite each other; and they then retract, though not energetically, their lips and ears. Hence I suspect that there is a tendency in some dogs, whenever they feel lively pleasure combined with affection, to act through habit and association on the same muscles, as in playfully biting each other, or their masters' hands. I have described, in the second chapter, the gait and appearance of a dog when cheerful, and the marked antithesis presented by the same animal when dejected and disappointed, with his head, ears, body, tail, and chops drooping, and eyes dull. Under the expectation of any great pleasure, dogs bound and jump about in an extravagant manner, and bark for joy. The tendency to bark under this state of mind is inherited, or runs in the breed: greyhounds rarely bark, whilst the Spitz-dog barks so incessantly on starting for a walk with his master that he becomes a nuisance. [1] `The Anatomy of Expression,' 1844, p. 140.An agony of pain is expressed by dogs in nearly the same way as by many other animals, namely, by howling writhing, and contortions of the whole body. Attention is shown by the head being raised, with the ears erected, and eyes intently directed towards the object or quarter under observation. If it be a sound and the source is not known, the head is often turned obliquely from side to side in a most significant manner, apparently in order to judge with more exactness from what point the sound proceeds. But I have seen a dog greatly surprised at a new noise, turning, his head to one side through habit, though he clearly perceived the source of the noise. Dogs, as formerly remarked, when their attention is in any way aroused, whilst watching some object, or attending to some sound, often lift up one paw (fig. 4) and keep it doubled up, as if to make a slow and stealthy approach. A dog under extreme terror will throw himself down, howl, and void his excretions; but the hair, I believe, does not become erect unless some anger is felt. I have seen a dog much terrified at a band of musicians who were playing loudly outside the house, with every muscle of his body trembling, with his heart palpitating so quickly that the beats could hardly be counted, and panting for breath with widely open mouth, in the same manner as a terrified man does. Yet this dog had not exerted himself; he had only wandered slowly and restlessly about the room, and the day was cold. Even a very slight degree of fear is invariably shown by the tail being tucked in between the legs. This tucking in of the fail is accompanied by the ears being drawn backwards; but they are not pressed closely to the head,as in snarling, and they are not lowered, as when a dog is pleased or affectionate. When two young dogs chase each other in play, the one that runs away always keeps his tail tucked inwards. So it is when a dog, in the highest spirits, careers like a mad creature round and round his master in circles, or in figures of eight. He then acts as if another dog were chasing him. This curious kind of play, which must be familiar to every one who has attended to dogs, is particularly apt to be excited, after the animal has been a little startled or frightened, as by his master suddenly jumping out on him in the dusk. In this case, as well as when two young dogs are chasing each other in play, it appears as if the one that runs away was afraid of the other catching him by the tail; but as far as I can find out, dogs very rarely catch each other in this manner. I asked a gentleman, who had kept foxhounds all his life, and be applied to other experienced sportsmen, whether they had ever seen hounds thus seize a fox; but they never had. It appears that when a dog is chased, or when in danger of being struck behind, or of anything falling on him, in all these cases he wishes to withdraw as quickly as possible his whole hind-quarters, and that from some sympathy or connection between the muscles, the tail is then drawn closely inwards. A similarly connected movement between the hind- quarters and the tail may be observed in the hyaena. Mr. Bartlett informs me that when two of these animals fight together, they are mutually conscious of the wonderful power of each other's jaws, and are extremely cautious. They well know that if one of their legs were seized, the bone would instantly be crushed into atoms; hence they approach each other kneeling, with their legs turned as much as possible inwards, and with their whole bodies bowed, so as not to present any salient point; thetail at the same time being closely tucked in between the legs. In this attitude they approach each other sideways, or even partly backwards. So again with deer, several of the species, when savage and fighting, tuck in their tails. When one horse in a field tries to bite the hind-quarters of another in play, or when a rough boy strikes a donkey from behind, the hind-quarters and the tail are drawn in, though it does not appear as if this were done merely to save the tail from being injured. We have also seen the reverse of these movements; for when an animal trots with high elastic steps, the tail is almost always carried aloft. As I have said, when a dog is chased and runs away, he keeps his ears directed backwards but still open; and this is clearly done for the sake of hearing the footsteps of his pursuer. From habit the ears are often held in this same position, and the tail tucked in, when the danger is obviously in front. I have repeatedly noticed, with a timid terrier of mine, that when she is afraid of some object in front, the nature of which she perfectly knows and does not need to reconnoitre, yet she will for a long time hold her ears and tail in this position, looking the image of discomfort. Discomfort, without any fear, is similarly expressed: thus, one day I went out of doors, just at the time when this same dog knew that her dinner would be brought. I did not call her, but she wished much to accompany me, and at the same time she wished much for her dinner; and there she stood, first looking one way and then the other, with her tail tucked in and ears drawn back, presenting an unmistakable appearance of perplexed discomfort. Almost all the expressive movements now described, with the exception of the grinning from joy, are innate or instinctive, for they are common to all the individuals, young and old, of all the breeds. Most of themare likewise common to the aboriginal parents of the dog, namely the wolf and jackal; and some of them to other species of the same group. Tamed wolves and jackals, when caressed by their masters, jump about for joy, wag their tails, lower their ears, lick their master's hands, crouch down, and even throw themselves on the ground belly upwards.[4] I have seen a rather fox-like African jackal, from the Gaboon, depress its ears when caressed. Wolves and jackals, when frightened, certainly tuck in their tails; and a tamed jackal has been described as careering round his master in circles and figures of eight, like a dog, with his tail between his legs. It has been stated[5] that foxes, however tame, never display any of the above expressive movements; but this is not strictly accurate. Many years ago I observed in the Zoological Gardens, and recorded the fact at the time, that a very tame English fox, When caressed by the keeper, wagged its tail, depressed its ears, and then threw itself on the ground, belly upwards. The black fox of North America likewise depressed its ears in a slight degree. But I believe that foxes never lick the hands of their masters, and I have been assured that when frightened they never tuck in their tails. If the explanation which I have given of the expression of affection in dogs be admitted, then it would appear that animals which have never been domesticated--namely wolves, jackals, and even foxes-- have nevertheless ac- quired, through the principle of antithesis, certain expressive gestures; for it is Dot probable that these animals, confined in cages, should have learnt them by imitating dogs. [4] Many particulars are given by Gueldenstadt in his account of the jackal in Nov. Comm. Acad. Sc. Imp. Petrop. 1775, tom. xx. p. 449. See also another excellent account of the manners of this animal and of its play, in `Land and Water,' October, 1869. Lieut. Annesley, R. A., has also communicated to me some particulars with respect to the jackal. I have made many inquiries about wolves and jackals in the Zoological Gardens, and have observed them for myself.
