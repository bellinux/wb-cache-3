25|$|To {{minimize}} {{counterparty risk}} to traders, trades executed on regulated futures exchanges are guaranteed by a clearing house. The clearing house becomes the buyer to each seller, and the seller to each buyer, {{so that in}} the event of a counterparty default the clearer assumes the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss.</b> This enables traders to transact without performing due diligence on their counterparty.|$|E

25|$|If Risky Corporation {{does not}} default on its bond payments, the pension fund makes {{quarterly}} payments to Derivative Bank for 5 years and receives its $10million back {{after five years}} from Risky Corp.

25|$|In a {{partnership}} or joint venture where money is lent, the creditor only provides the capital yet is guaranteed {{a fixed amount}} of profit. The debtor, however, puts in time and effort, but is made to bear the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss.</b> Muslim scholars argue that such practice is unjust. As an alternative to usury, Islam strongly encourages charity and direct investment in which the creditor shares whatever profit or loss the business may incur (in modern terms, this amounts to an equity stake in the business).|$|E

25|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{increase}} {{can buy a}} call option to purchase the stock at a fixed price ("strike price") at a later date, rather than purchase the stock outright. The cash outlay on the option is the premium. The trader would have no obligation to buy the stock, but only {{has the right to}} do so at or before the expiration date. The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> would be limited to the premium paid, unlike the possible loss had the stock been bought outright.|$|E
25|$|The scuba diver {{generally}} has an operational {{need to control}} depth without resorting to a line to the surface or holding onto a structure or landform, or resting on the bottom. This requires the ability to achieve neutral buoyancy {{at any time during}} a dive, otherwise the effort expended to maintain depth by swimming against the buoyancy difference will both task load the diver and require an otherwise unnecessary expenditure of energy, increasing air consumption, and increasing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> of control and escalation to an accident.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{believe that}} the Iranian Interest-Free banking law has simply created the context for legitimizing usury or riba. In reality all banks are {{charging}} their borrowers a fixed pre-set amount {{at a rate of}} interest that is approved by the Central Bank at least once a year. No goods or services are exchanged as part of these contracts and banks rarely assume any Commercial Risk. High value collateral items such as real estate, commercial paper, bank guarantees and machinery eliminate any <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss.</b> In case of defaults or bankruptcies, the principal amount, the expected interest and the late fees are collected through possession and or sale of secured collaterals.|$|E

25|$|In {{slippery}} conditions some riders {{prefer to}} ride fixed {{because they believe}} the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, {{there is also an}} increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).|$|E
25|$|Other {{tests of}} {{employment}} {{have focused on}} different contractual and external factors. Lord Denning proposed a test based on the integration of an individual to a business or organisation. Tests based on the economic relationship between an employer and employee have found favour in subsequent cases, notably Market Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security, in the decision of Lord Cooke. Here, it was argued that where a person was in business on their own account (and at their own risk), they would be under a contract for services, whilst otherwise they would be under a contract of service. This idea have been cited with approval by the Privy Council, with several relevant factors being considered, such as <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss,</b> and chance of profit.|$|E
500|$|Concern {{exists that}} the closed stud book and tightly {{regulated}} {{population of the}} Thoroughbred is at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> of genetic diversity because {{of the level of}} inadvertent inbreeding inevitable in such a small population. According to one study, 78% of alleles in the current population can be traced to 30foundation animals, 27 of which are male. Ten foundation mares account for 72% of maternal (tail-female) lineages, and, as noted above, one stallion appears in 95% of tail male lineages. [...] Thoroughbred pedigrees are generally traced through the maternal line, called the distaff line. The line that a horse comes from is a critical factor in determining the price for a young horse.|$|E

2500|$|During {{and after}} the Revolution, many states passed laws favoring colonial debtors to the {{detriment}} of foreign creditors. [...] Federalists, especially Alexander Hamilton, believed that such a practice would jeopardize the future flow of foreign capital into the fledgling United States. [...] Consequently, the Contract Clause, by ensuring the inviolability of sales and financing contracts, encouraged an inflow of foreign capital by reducing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> to foreign merchants trading with and investing in the former colonies.|$|E

The flakes of frozen water remain {{in the press and}} only the sweet juice flows. This is the principle of ice wine. Cryoextraction is a recent technique invented to reproduce the phenomenon in the regions which are not cold enough: the grapes are artificially frozen before being pressed. This method overcomes the climate and harvesting work can continue without waiting for the frosts (<b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> of the grapes by weather accident or attack by hungry sparrows), but shortening the maturation does not give the same flavour.|$|E
2500|$|While {{reconciliation}} ecology {{attempts to}} modify the human world to encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting human use, there are still difficulties in getting broad acceptance of the idea. For example, addition of large woods to urban river systems, which provides critical habitat structure for native fish and invertebrates {{may be seen as}} [...] "untidy" [...] and a sign of poor management by residents. Similarly, many suburban areas do not allow long, unkempt lawns that provide useful wildlife habitat because of perceived damage to property values. Many humans have negative feelings toward certain species, especially predators such as wolves, which are often based more on perceived risk than actual <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> or injury resulting from the animal.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{temperatures}} and snow scarce winter seasons challenge the winter tourism industry. In this study {{the impacts of}} + 2  °C global warming on winter tourism demand in Europe’s ski tourism related NUTS- 3 regions are quantified. Using time series regression models, the relationship between natural snow conditions and monthly overnight stays is estimated. Based on these model results, we quantify the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> tourism demand <b>losses</b> due to weather variability and assess the potential impacts of climate change. Hereby, the concept <b>of</b> Weather-Value at <b>Risk</b> (0. 95) is applied. Snow data are provided by the hydrological model VIC, which is forced by E-OBS data to obtain historical snow values for tourism model calibration and forced by EURO-CORDEX climate simulations to obtain snow projections until 2100. Under + 2  °C warming, the weather-induced <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> in winter overnight stays related to skiing tourism in Europe amounts to up to 10. 1 million nights per winter season, which is + 7. 3 million overnight stays additionally at risk compared to the reference period (1971 – 2000). Among the top four European skiing tourism nations – Austria, France, Italy and Switzerland – France and Switzerland show the lowest increase in <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> in winter overnight stays. The highest weather-induced <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> in winter overnight stays – in the reference period {{as well as in}} the + 2  °C scenarios – is found in Austria, followed by Italy. These two countries account for the largest fraction of winter overnight stays in skiing related NUTS- 3 regions...|$|R
