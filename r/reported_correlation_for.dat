40|$|The heat {{transfer}} characteristics of turbulent air flow in a multipass channel were studied via the naphthalene sublimation technique. The naphthalene-coated test section, {{consisting of two}} straight, square channels joined by a 180 deg turn, resembled the internal cooling passages of gas turbine airfoils. The {{top and bottom surfaces}} of the test channel were roughened by rib turbulators. The rib height-to-hydraulic diameter ratio (e/D) were 0. 063 and 0. 094, and the rib pitch-to-height ratio (P/e) were 10 and 20. The local heat/mass transfer coefficients on the roughened top wall and on the smooth divider and side walls of the test channel were determined for three Reynolds numbers of 15, 30, and 60, thousand, and for three angles of attack (alpha) of 90, 60, and 45 deg. Results showed that the local Sherwood numbers on the ribbed walls were 1. 5 to 6. 5 times those for a fully developed flow in a smooth square duct. The average ribbed-wall Sherwood numbers were 2. 5 to 3. 5 times higher than the fully developed values, depending on the rib angle of attack and the Reynolds number. The results also indicated that, before the turn, the heat/mass transfer coefficients in the cases of alpha = 60 and 45 deg were higher than those in the case of alpha= 90 deg. However, after the turn, the heat/mass transfer coefficients in the oblique-rib cases were lower than those in the transverse rib case. <b>Correlations</b> <b>for</b> the average Sherwood number ratios for individual channel surfaces and for the overall Sherwood number ratios are <b>reported.</b> <b>Correlations</b> <b>for</b> the fully developed friction factors and for the loss coefficients are also provided...|$|R

40|$|The co-movement of US {{stock markets}} and the dollar The {{relationship}} between US stock {{markets and the}} dollar {{has been the subject}} of increased interest recently. In part, this interest reflects the view that portfolio flows may have exerted an important influence on recent movements of the major exchange rates (BIS (2000)). Indeed, while fixed income securities still account for the bulk of cross-border financial transactions, equities markets are playing an increasing role in such transactions. In 1995, cross-border transactions in bonds into and out of the United States amounted to 110 % of US GDP, more than five times the corresponding ratio for equity flows. In 1999, cross-border transactions in bonds rose to 126 % of US GDP, while transactions in equities tripled and reached 75 % of US GDP. From a policy point of view, the interest in this topic reflects in part concerns about the current high valuation of the US stock market and the consequent global deflationary impact should the dollar fall along with that market.

The Reynolds numbers based on the mean flow velocity and the channel width are in the range 100 ≤ Re ≤ 1500 and the Richardson numbers vary within 0. 1 ≤ Ri ≤ 10. Particle Image Velocimetry has been used for the measurements in a water channel. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations have been carried out with a second order finite volume code considering the Boussinesq approximation since, for the experimental conditions considered, the variation of the physical properties with temperature has no significant influence on the overall flow topology. For 100 ≤ Re ≤ 1500 and Ri ≤ 0. 1 the flow is steady and it consists in a single roll that exhibits larger velocities as the Richardson number is increased. An unsteady periodic flow is found at Re = 100 and Ri = 10. Alternate flow ejections from the cavity to the channel occur near the lateral walls while the flow enters the cavity from the channel through the central part of the cavity. A conditional sampling technique has been used to elucidate the evolution of the mean unsteady turbulent flow at Ri = 10. It has been found that the alternate flow ejections persist for all the Reynolds analyzed.

40|$|The {{magnitude}} of the overlap among dimensions of neuropsychological test performance in schizophrenia {{has been the subject}} of perennial controversy. This issue has taken on renewed importance with the recent focus on cognition as a treatment target in schizophrenia. A substantial body of factor analytic literature indicates that dimensions are separable in schizophrenia. However, this literature is generally uninformative as to whether the separable dimensions are independent, weakly correlated, or strongly correlated. Factor analyses have often used methods (ie, principal components analysis with orthogonal rotation) that preclude this determination, and correlations among factor-based domain composites and underlying measures have been reported infrequently in these studies. Current meta-analyses of <b>reported</b> “between-dimension” <b>correlations</b> <b>for</b> individual neuropsychological measures and for cognitive domain composite variables indicate that cognition variables in schizophrenia are correlated, on average, at a “medium” level of r[*]=[*] 0. 37 for individual measures from different cognitive dimensions and r[*]=[*] 0. 45 for domain composites. Because these are mean bivariate correlations, the multiple correlation of an individual measure with all the other measures in a cognitive battery is likely to be higher. Measure reliabilities of 0. 80 or less also imply greater commonality among traditional neuropsychological measures. In short, there are underappreciated constraints on the amount of reliable cognitive performance variance in traditional neuropsychological test batteries that is free to vary independently. The ability of such batteries to reveal cognitive domain–specific treatment effects in schizophrenia may be much more limited than is generally assumed...|$|R

40|$|Glaucoma is an eye {{disorder}} {{in which the}} optic nerve suffers damage, leading to vision defect in the affected eye(s) and rolling to complete blindness if untreated. It is frequently associated with increased pressure in the fluid of the eye; aqueous humour. Glaucoma often goes undetected until significant damage to the subject’s visual field has occurred. As glaucoma progresses, neural tissues die, the nerve fiber layer thins and the cup-to-disk ratio increases.

40|$|Sharma, Yetton, and Crawford (2009) have {{recently}} proposed an elegant method {{for assessing the}} impact of common-method variance (CMV) in research studies. To illustrate their method, they applied it to the empirical literature that builds on Davis et al. ’s (1989) Technology Acceptance model (TAM). Results of their assessment {{of the extent to}} which the research literature on TAM appears to be affected by CMV are shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1, the horizontal axis measures Susceptibility to CMV (which Sharma et al. term “Common Method Variance, Method-Method Pair–Instrument”, or CMV[MMP-I] for short), and the vertical axis shows the mean correlation coefficients from their meta analysis of 50 studies that <b>reported</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficients <b>for</b> the relationship between Perceived Usefulness (PU) and computersystem Use (a key relationship in TAM). The implications of their analysis are that (a) commonmethod variance is likely to have had a major confounding influence on many empirical studies in both the Information Systems (IS) literature and elsewhere, and (b) the “true ” underlying correlation between PU and Use in the population of computer-system users (described by Sharma et al., Appendix C, p. A 9, as the “focal construct-construct <b>correlation</b> controlling <b>for</b> CMV”) is quite low. The purpose of this document is to argue that there at least one other explanation of Sharma et al. ’s data that leads to very different conclusions than either (a) or (b). The reason for offering this alternative explanation is that Sharma et al. ’s conclusion (b) above is counter-intuitive. Intuition says that in any situation where use of a tool to achieve some task is warranted, there will be a high correlation between PU and Use. Yet Sharma et al. ’s conclusion says the opposite. It is this conflict between intuition and Sharma et al. ’s conclusion that motivated this document. The question is: “Is there any other possible alternative explanation of Sharma et al. ’s data that supports the intuitive expectation that, when use is warranted, the correlation between PU and Use would normally be high?...|$|R

Potentially toxic solutes such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are continuously released from pollutant oil phases described above to the water phase. The research was aimed at understanding how physicochemical as well as biological phenomena affect dissolution and biodegradation of PAH compounds from pollutant oil phases. These phenomena were investigated for a simple two-component non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) and for creosote, a multi component NAPL. Mass transfer experiments of naphthalene from a synthesized two-component NAPL were conducted to assess the extent of variation of mass transfer rate coefficients between column and completely mixed flow-through (CMFT) systems. The differences in the hydrodynamics between column and CMFT systems, employed in this study, resulted in a difference in the mass transfer rate coefficients of a factor of 3. Several <b>reported</b> empirical <b>correlations</b> <b>for</b> the estimation of mass transfer coefficients in batch and column systems were verified. Good agreement between Sherwood numbers, a dimensionless quantity reflecting the magnitude of the mass transfer coefficient, predicted by the <b>reported</b> <b>correlations</b> and those calculated from mass transfer coefficients obtained from the experiments was obtained in all cases. The biodegradation kinetic coefficients mumax and Ks for the biodegradation of naphthalene from a two-component NAPL, coated onto uniformly sized nonporous particles, were evaluated in completely mixed batch reactor (CMBR) systems and in flow-through column systems. The values obtained for mumax and Ks from column systems were very close to those obtained from CMBR systems. This suggests that both coefficients estimated from CMBR or column systems can be applied for modeling studies. The development of biofilms at the NAPL-water interface reduced mass transfer rates of naphthalene by 70 % in column systems and 60 % in CMBR systems. Viscous interfacial films develop at the creosote-water interface when creosote is aged in water for a period of time. The mass transfer rate coefficient of naphthalene from creosote to water was reduced by 30 % over a one-week aging period. Minor additional reductions were observed with further aging. Hindered diffusion through the bulk creosote phase and changes in composition of creosote as a result of extended dissolution did not account for the observed reductions...|$|R

Previous work suggested that black holes of active (Seyfert 1) galaxies follow a similar relation, but apparently with a significantly lower value of MBH/Mbulge (Wandel 1999). New data show that this difference was mainly due to overestimated black hole masses in quiescent galaxies and bulge magnitudes in Seyfert galaxies. Using new and updated data we show that AGNs (Seyfert galaxies and quasars) follow the same BH-bulge relation as ordinary (inactive) galaxies. We derive the BH/bulge relation for a sample of 55 AGNs (Seyfert 1 s + quasars) and 35 quiescent galaxies. We find that broad line AGNs have an average black hole/bulge mass fraction of ∼ 0. 0015 with a spread of 2 - 3, and a strong correlation (MBH ∝ L 0. 9 ± 0. 16 bulge), consistent with the BH-bulge relation found in quiescent galaxies.

Resistance to stalk tunneling damage from the second-generation larvae appears to be quantitatively inherited, and {{may be related to}} cell wall components (CWCs) in the leaf sheath and stalk. In order to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect resistance to stalk tunneling and clarify their association with QTL affecting cell wall components in the leaf sheath and stalk, two populations of B 73 (susceptible to tunneling by ECB, low to intermediate concentrations of CWCs) x De 811 (resistant, high CWCs) were developed, one consisting of 147 F 3 lines and the other of 191 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Both populations were artificially infested with ECB larvae at pollen shed, and stalks were split at 60 days after infestation and the amount of tunneling was recorded. These populations were also analyzed for concentrations of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and acid detergent lignin (ADL) in the leaf sheaths and stalks. The samples were scanned using near infrared spectroscopy and prediction equations were developed using data collected from a subset of samples analyzed using the van Soest detergent method. Composite interval mapping (CIM) was used to detect QTL for each trait, and the relationships between the QTL detected for the same traits in different generations and among different traits in the same generation were examined. Seven and fourteen QTL for stalk tunneling were observed in the mean environments for the F 3 and RI lines of B 73 x De 811, four and twelve of which, respectively, are linked to QTL for CWCs. The previously <b>reported</b> genetic <b>correlations</b> <b>for</b> ECB stalk tunneling with CWCs in the F 3 lines (rg = - 0. 11 to - 0. 33) indicate that a genetic association may exist between the two traits. However, the genetic <b>correlations</b> <b>for</b> the RIL were - 0. 03 to 0. 08, raising the possibility that the correlations observed in the F 3 lines were either due to environmental factors or the result of linkage disequilibrium. Factors other than concentrations of CWCs appear {{to be associated with the}} expression of resistance to stalk tunneling in this population...|$|R

Positive <b>correlations</b> <b>for</b> increased nausea were found with heavier placentae (p = 0. 005), non-smoking status (p = 0. 004), women with nausea in previous pregnancies (p = 0. 005), and women whose mothers experienced trouble with nausea in their pregnancies (p = 0. 001). 17 other factors did not relate to pregnancy nausea at the p < 0. 01 level...|$|R
40|$|Biometrics can be {{used for}} {{identification}} and authentication to offer a higher level of security than conventional methods. Fingerprints are a good choice among the biometrics as they are unique to a person. This <b>report</b> considers <b>correlation</b> filters <b>for</b> fingerprint verification because of their shift invariance, ability to accommodate in-class image variability and closed form expressions. In certain applications, it would be advantageous to do verification and/or enrollment in a chip inside the fingerprint sensor to prewmt tampering. For such applications, memory and computation become important issues. This report focuses on exploring various ways of reducing complexity, while ensuring good verification performance. These methods are tested on two databases, a subset of the plastic distortion set of the NIST special database 24 and a fingerprint database collected at CMU. The images in the NIST database have been obtained from an optical sensor with resolution 500 dpi. The images in the CMU database have been collected from a capacitive sensor and have a resolution of 350 dpi. The MACE and the OTSDF filters evaluated on the NIST database, as we believe they offer the right combination of verificatio...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that obesity represents a risk for enhanced gray matter (GM) density changes {{comparable to those}} demonstrated for mild cognitive impairment in the elderly. However, {{it is not clear}} what mechanisms underlie this apparent alteration in brain structure of overweight subjects and to what extent these changes can already occur in the adolescent human brain. In the present volumetric magnetic resonance imaging study, we investigated GM changes and serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a marker for neuronal injury, in a set of overweight/obese subjects and controls. We <b>report</b> a negative <b>correlation</b> <b>for</b> overweight and obese subjects between serum NSE and GM density in hippocampal and cerebellar regions. To validate our neuroimaging findings, we complement these data with NSE gene expression information obtained from the Allen Brain atlas. GM density changes were localized in brain areas that mediate cognitive function—the hippocampus associated with memory performance, and the cognitive cerebellum (lateral posterior lobes) associated with executive, spatial and linguistic processing. The data of our present study highlight the importance of extending current research on cognitive function and brain plasticity in the elderly in the context of obesity to young adult subjects and include serum biomarkers to validate imaging findings generally...|$|R
40|$|Perforated {{tubes are}} widely used in {{industry}} for various applications. A special application arises when there is fluid injection into the perforated tube. Such cases arise when perforated tubes are used for horizontal oil well drilling and French drains. The behaviour of the flow under these conditions {{has led to the}} development of correlations, which consider the effects of the perforations and injection process. However, there are few friction factor correlations in literature, which consider the increased kinetic energy at the perforated tube outlet caused by fluid injection and acceleration. The current study <b>reports</b> experimental <b>correlations</b> <b>for</b> determining the friction factor of perforated tubes when the additional kinetic energy from the injection process is considered. The friction factor measurements were conducted in copper tubes with an internal diameter of 20. 8 mm and a wall thickness of 1 mm at three nondimensional pitches of 0. 375, 0. 75 and 1. 5. A perforated length-to-diameter ratio of 40 : 1 was used for the perforated tubes. A perforation row contained seven small perforation holes with a diameter of 1. 5 mm spaced evenly around the perimeter of the tube. These perforation rows were staggered row to row, resulting in triangular perforation patterns. Water was used as a test medium with Reynolds numbers at the tube outlet ranging from 20 000 to 60 000. The injection ratio was varied from 0 to 5 % to obtain a total of 135 unique combinations of perforated tube friction factor data at different injection ratios, Reynolds numbers and nondimensional perforation pitches. The experiments were condensed into friction factor correlations, which allow perforated tube parameters to be optimisation for minimising pressure losses encountered in draining operations.

40|$|In {{a similar}} {{approach}} to that used for the previously issued <b>correlation</b> <b>report</b> <b>for</b> Coflon (CAPP/M. 10), this report aims to identify any correlations between mechanical property changes and chemical/morphological changes for Tefzel, using information supplied in other MERL and TRI project reports. Differences identified with Coflon behaviour will be of scientific interest as well as appropriate to project applications, as Tefzel and Coflon are chemical isomers. Owing to the considerable chemical resistance of Tefzel, much of its testing {{so far has been}} based on mechanical properties. Where changes have occurred, chemical analysis can now be targeted more effectively. Relevant test data collated here include: tensile modulus and related properties, permeation coefficients, % crystallinity, some crack growth resistance measurements, and other observations where significant. Fluids based on methanol and amine (Fluid G), a mixture of methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide gases plus an aqueous amine solution (Fluid F), and an aromatic oil mix of heptane, cyclohexane, toluene and 1 -propanol (Fluid I) have affected Tefzel to varying degrees, and are discussed in some detail herein...|$|R
