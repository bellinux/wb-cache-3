RFID supply chain performance can be enhanced by integrating <b>RFID</b> <b>functions</b> into the web service paradigm.

Some businesses have realised benefits of RFID adoption through improvements in operational efficiency, additional cost savings, and opportunities for higher revenues. RFID research in warehousing operations has been less prominent than in other application domains. To investigate how RFID technology has had an impact in warehousing, a comprehensive analysis of research findings available from articles through leading scientific article databases has been conducted. Articles from years 1995 to 2010 have been reviewed and analysed with respect to warehouse operations, RFID application domains, benefits achieved and obstacles encountered. Four discussion topics are presented covering RFID in warehousing focusing on its applications, perceived benefits, obstacles to its adoption and future trends.

40|$|Animal {{models of}} human {{pathology}} {{are essential for}} biomedical research. However, a recurring issue {{in the use of}} animal models is the poor reproducibility of behavioural and physiological findings within and between laboratories. The most critical factor influencing this issue remains the experimenter themselves. One solution is the use of procedures devoid of human intervention. We present a novel approach to experimenter-free testing cognitive abilities in rats, by combining undisturbed group housing with automated, standardized and individual operant testing. This experimenter-free system consisted of an automated-operant system (Bussey-Saksida rat touch screen) connected to a home cage containing group living rats via an automated animal sorter (PhenoSys). The automated animal sorter, which is based on radio-frequency identification (<b>RFID)</b> technology, <b>functioned</b> as a mechanical replacement of the experimenter. Rats learnt to regularly and individually enter the operant chamber and remained there {{for the duration of the}} experimental session only. Self-motivated rats acquired the complex touch screen task of trial-unique non-matching to location (TUNL) in half the time reported for animals that were manually placed into the operant chamber. Rat performance was similar between the two groups within our laboratory, and comparable to previously published results obtained elsewhere. This reproducibility, both within and between laboratories, confirms the validity of this approach. In addition, automation reduced daily experimental time by 80 %, eliminated animal handling, and reduced equipment cost. This automated, experimenter-free setup is a promising tool of great potential for testing a large variety of functions with full automation in future studies...|$|R
40|$|RFID emerges {{to be one}} of the key {{technologies}} to modernize Logistics and supply chain management. In a typical RFID enabled logistics and supply chain application, there exist RFID readers to detect and identify the goods with RFID tags attached. Considering the huge amount of goods, the successful reading of RFID data becomes a crucial issue. Many algorithms and models to improve the RFID reading have been proposed, yet most of them focus on addressing the problem in a single reading node. In this paper, we introduce a P 2 P model to identify and remove inaccurate reading of RFID data by utilizing the information exchanged among related nodes along the business processing route of each RFID tagged item. The successful deployment of this model will ease the demand for high accurate reading of each RFID reading node while reducing the total cost of the RFID network. Our simulation shows the <b>RFID</b> network correct <b>function</b> against the business requirements will be ensured while the overall performance of the RFID network can be guaranteed. © 2008 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|For a food {{supplier}} (Fig. 1), (An & Noh, 2009) cold {{technologies are}} critical to cool chain operations and (Byran & Brian, 1999) the procurement of cold facilities is critical for service to LSCs. Currently, food suppliers incorporate multi-temperature measuring devices (e.g., melting point, thermal expansion, emissivity, diffusion, solidification temperature), viscoelastic properties or chemical reactions (e.g., electrochemical corrosion, enzymatic reactions, and polymerisation) and mobile technology to ensure food quality and safety in the cold chain. The emergence of radio frequency identification (RFID) is a common type of mobile technology. RFID {{can be used to}} track, identify and recall products in the food supply chain. <b>RFID</b> includes various <b>functions</b> such as real-time information, real-time tracing, order tracing and temperature monitoring (Kuo and Chen, 2010). It can ensure that perishable products with different temperature requirements can be kept in the best-quality condition from the point of supply to the point of consumption throughout the processes of storage and distribution along the food supply chain (Kuo and Chen 2010). Seafarers can thus be assured that the products they order will be received freshly, safely and on time.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, radio {{frequency}} identification technology has moved into the mainstream applications that help to speed up handling of manufactured goods and materials. RFID tags are divided into two classes: active and passive. Active tag requires a power source that’s why its cost is more than passive tags. However, the low-cost RFID tags are facing new challenges to security and privacy. Some solutions utilize expensive cryptographic primitives such as hash or encryption functions, and some lightweight approaches {{have been reported to}} be not secure. This paper describes a lightweight Mutual authentication and ownership transfer protocol utilizing minimalistic cryptography using Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF) and Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR). PUFs and LFSRs are very efficient in hardware and particularly suitable for the lowcost <b>RFID</b> tags. To <b>functioning</b> security in low cost RFID tag minimum gate requirement is 2000 gates. To implement security protocols using PUF and LFSR functions need only approx 800 gates. In this paper it is explained how we can authenticate and transfer ownership of low cost RFID tag securely using LFSR and PUF as compared to existing solutions based on hash functions...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focused on}} HF RFID systems, {{where it was}} a goal to {{increase}} {{the reliability of the}} system. Especially in environments with metallic parts many problems occur. It became clear that many problems took place at the loop antenna of the RFID system. Therefore, we focussed on the design of loop antennas in order to increase the reliability of HF RFID systems. Although HF RFID systems are widely adopted by the industry, it was shown that the implementation of an RFID system for a specific environment involves a lot of design choices. Considering the loop antenna, several important design parameters have {{to be taken into account}} if we are aiming for a proper <b>functioning</b> HF <b>RFID</b> system. Metal objects in the vicinity of the loop antenna can have a high impact on the functionality of the system. In some cases a redesign of the loop antenna is needed. A redefinition of several design parameters and a solution, in terms of a new antenna concept, was proposed to take care of metal objects in the vicinity of the antenna. It has been made clear that an environment with metal objects has to be handled with care. If we only consider simple environments with one metal plate or object, we can design the loop antenna analytically. But when the environment becomes more complex, one needs a strong tool to create a reliable loop antenna for these environments. The main result of this thesis is the creation of an automated antenna design tool (AADT) which takes care of metals in the vicinity and creates an optimized loop antenna. The optimized loop antennas are based on parametric shapes and self-defined <b>RFID</b> goal <b>functions.</b> Two practical and challenging test cases served as an evaluation of the AADT in which an optimized loop antenna was implemented. In both cases, we created a reliable HF RFID system, which always met the specified requirements. At all time, measurements confirmed the simulation results. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{technology}} bridges {{the physical}} and virtual worlds by enabling computers to track the movement of objects. Within a few years, RFID tags will replace barcodes on consumer items {{to increase the efficiency}} in logistics processes. The same tags, however, can be used to monitor business processes of competitors and to track individuals by the items they carry or wear. This work seeks to diminish this loss of privacy by adding affordable privacy protection to RFID systems. Technical privacy measures should be integrated in RFID tags in order to thwart rogue scanning and preserve the privacy of individuals and corporations. To be available for the upcoming deployment of item-level tags, protection measures must not substantially increase the costs of RFID systems. Previously proposed solutions, however, would unacceptably increase the costs of RFID tags, because the solutions use building blocks which were not optimized for privacy applications. Privacy, therefore, has been considered too expensive to be included in low-cost tags. This dissertation instead argues that privacy can be achieved at very low cost within the tight constraints of the smallest RFID tags and the largest installations. Designing more economical protection systems requires a better understanding of what properties are crucial for privacy. By modeling the incentives of attackers and measuring the extent to which different protection measures rescind these incentives, protection systems can be found that prevent different attacks. Sufficient protection is achieved if the cost of rogue scanning exceeds its expected return for all likely attackers. Perfect protection is neither possible nor necessary to achieve strong privacy. Protection can be realized through the combination of purposefully designed cryptographic primitives and optimized private identification protocols. These protocols achieve privacy only probabilistically, but—when parameterized well—disclose very little information. Adding noise to tag responses is one example for a protocol-level measure that provides a tradeoff between privacy and cost. The noise makes most tags indistinguishable to rogue readers while only modestly increasing the workload for the backend system. Privacy protocols rely on cryptographic functions, but all available functions are too expensive for <b>RFID</b> tags. New <b>functions</b> should not provide expensive properties that are not necessary for privacy, but be an order of magnitude cheaper. Adapting small noise-based hash functions proposed for authentication is one alternative to achieving some of the properties of cryptographic functions without incurring their costs. Another alternative is designing new cryptographic primitives to share resources with functions already present on <b>RFID</b> tags. Such <b>functions</b> can be found through automated tests that measure the cryptographic strength {{of a large number of}} possible designs. To achieve maximal privacy within a given cost budget, all design choices need to be considered concurrently, as similar tradeoffs often exist in different building blocks. This dissertation provides the building blocks needed to achieve strong privacy at low cost as well as a design method for building private systems from these building blocks. Towards this end, contributions are made in modeling the value of information, measuring privacy, optimizing privacy protocols, and designing cryptographic primitives...|$|R
40|$|Achieving {{emotional}} competence {{depends on}} socialization. Especially in preschool, where children {{are introduced to}} a broader social group, interacting with peers is quite a challenge. Recess is the context which children naturally chose to foster their relationships. Yet, emotions can run high during recess and for some children {{it is difficult to}} adopt adaptive behaviors, ending up alone. To date, only few studies have tried to understand the course of social and nonsocial behaviors shown {{in the beginning of the}} school year. For example, it is unknown to what extent different forms of social play, e. g. physical play or pretend play, are related to later social skills, or whether nonsocial behaviors are related to more later solitude. Besides, given the importance of emotional competence within peer relationships, it is also important to examine the possible mediating role that children’s emotional competence might have in the pathway to later solitude. To address these questions we developed a study with 97 Portuguese preschoolers. Play behaviors were videotaped at the playground. Social solitude was assessed through an innovative measuring method, based on <b>RFID</b> devices. Emotional <b>functioning</b> (theory of mind, empathy, emotion understanding, aggression) and social skills were obtained through tasks, parent and teacher reports. The results showed that nonsocial behaviors were related to a general lack of emotional skills, which may explain the initial withdrawal. Solitary and social pretend play were related to later solitude and to lower ratings of social skills, contrary to physical play that was positively associated with social skills...|$|R
