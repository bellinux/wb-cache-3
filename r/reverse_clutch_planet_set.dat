25|$|The {{majority}} of 1857 model Waltham movements are keywind {{from the rear}} and keyset from the front. A small amount of the total production of 1857 model movements were fitted with a stemwind mechanism from the factory. The earliest stemwind 1857 movements were fitted with no <b>reversing</b> <b>clutch</b> on the winding stem, and had no setting mechanism; these early movements required using a key to set the time. Later stemwind movements were lever setting, with a unique design of set lever which pivoted out from the movement rather than pulling out. Later 1857 movements also added a <b>reversing</b> <b>clutch,</b> a feature ubiquitous on all subsequent Waltham stemwind watches. All stemwind 1857 movements have the winding stem located at 3:00.|$|R
50|$|The Windstar was {{paired with}} an AX4S transaxle, which {{was prone to}} {{internal}} failure. The transmission suffered from cracked forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>clutch</b> pistons. These transmission failures were most susceptible with the 3.8L engine, as the transmission could not handle the extra torque and the extra vehicle weight.|$|R

5000|$|... "Compound {{planetary}} gear" [...] is {{a general}} concept and it refers to any planetary gears involving {{one or more of}} the following three types of structures: meshed-planet (there are at least two or more planets in mesh with each other in each planet train), stepped-planet (there exists a shaft connection between two planets in each planet train), and multi-stage structures (the system contains two or more <b>planet</b> <b>sets).</b>|$|R
50|$|Epicyclic gearing or {{planetary}} gearing is a gear system consisting {{of one or}} more outer gears, or planet gears, revolving about a central, or sun gear. Typically, the planet gears are mounted on a movable arm or carrier, which itself may rotate relative to the sun gear. Epicyclic gearing systems also incorporate the use of an outer ring gear or annulus, which meshes with the planet gears. Planetary gears (or epicyclic gears) are typically classified as simple or compound planetary gears. Simple planetary gears have one sun, one ring, one carrier, and one <b>planet</b> <b>set.</b> Compound planetary gears involve {{one or more of the}} following three types of structures: meshed-planet (there are at least two more planets in mesh with each other in each planet train), stepped-planet (there exists a shaft connection between two planets in each planettrain), and multi-stage structures (the system contains two or more <b>planet</b> <b>sets).</b> Compared to simple planetary gears, compound planetary gears have the advantages of larger reduction ratio, higher torque-to-weight ratio, and more ﬂexible conﬁgurations.|$|R

50|$|In 2007-08, Gay's second season, {{he set a}} Grizzlies' {{franchise}} {{record for}} points in a single season (1,632) and established a career high for scoring average (20.1 points), becoming just the third player in franchise history to average 20 points per game (behind only Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Pau Gasol). He participated in the 2008 Rising Stars Slam Dunk Contest, and finished runner-up to Hedo Türkoğlu for the 2007-08 NBA Most Improved Player Award. After his invitation to the 2008 Slam Dunk Contest, Gay and YouTube teamed up for the Rudy Gay Slam Dunk Contest promotion, in which he asked fans to upload footage of their best dunks for him to attempt during the contest. During the contest, he performed a one handed <b>reverse</b> <b>clutch</b> dunk in the first round, and during the second round, teammate Kyle Lowry alley-ooped the ball off the bar and from behind the backboard; Gay regathered and pulled off a windmill dunk. He ended with a score of 85 but did not advance to the second round.|$|R
5000|$|When the transbrake {{is engaged}} at the drag race track {{starting}} line (driver holding the pushbutton depressed), {{the car is}} held stationary regardless of how much engine power {{is applied to the}} drive line. The driver typically applies full throttle at this time, and the car remains stationary at the starting line under full engine power. When the driver sees the desired visual cue before him, the driver promptly releases his finger (or thumb) from the pushbutton. This button release opens the contacts within the pushbutton switch signaling the delay box and the delay box now begins an internal countdown. When the countdown timer reaches zero, the delay box stops current flowing to the solenoid in the transmission and that causes the spool valve to return to its normal position. With the spool valve in its normal position hydraulic fluid pressure in the transmission is removed from the <b>reverse</b> <b>clutch</b> pack (but maintained in the forward clutch pack), this causes the drag race car to [...] "launch" [...] (often with great thrust) from the starting line, accelerating rapidly forward toward the finish line.|$|R
