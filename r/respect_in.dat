5|$|Although a professional—captains at {{the time}} were almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the <b>respect</b> <b>in</b> which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E
5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and sticking broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another <b>respect</b> <b>in</b> which he differed from many opera composers is that he did not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian Orthodox Church decisively {{opposed the}} charges against Joachim III and {{considered}} the emperor's actions personal vengeance. It included {{his name in the}} list of the Patriarchs, preserved in the Book of Boril, and mentioned him in the liturgies. The litanies in his honour indicate that Joachim III was remembered with <b>respect</b> <b>in</b> the Church. He was the second Bulgarian Patriarch executed by the ruling monarch after Vissarion, condemned by Ivan Asen II (r. 1218–1241) after refusing to bless his third marriage.|$|E

5|$|Alexios was {{replaced}} as commander by John Tarchaneiotes, first cousin of Andronikos II, and {{disappeared from the}} scene for 30 years. His successors proved greatly inferior, and by 1323, Byzantine possessions in Asia had been greatly reduced. At that point, Patriarch Jesaias urged Andronikos to recall the aged general. A desperate Andronikos agreed and pardoned Alexios in 1324. Alexios was tasked with relieving the isolated exclave of Philadelphia, which had been long under siege {{and was ready to}} fall. He was given no army, but, according to the Byzantine chroniclers, the mere news of Alexios's approach, and the <b>respect</b> <b>in</b> which the Turks held him, was enough for the siege to be lifted. Alexios was appointed governor of the city, a position he retained until 1327.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal. Hajj serves {{as a reminder of}} the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with <b>respect</b> <b>in</b> Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, and should not be a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he was treated with <b>respect</b> <b>in</b> the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he {{was treated as a}} government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E

5|$|Hemlock Hoax is {{a detective}} who has little <b>respect</b> <b>in</b> the small {{tropical}} town where he lives, {{despite the fact}} that he thinks he is a better sleuth than Sherlock Holmes. A pair of boys decide to play a trick on Hoax and tell him about a murder. Hoax rushes to scene of the crime where he discovers a shred of cloth, later finding that a tramp is wearing the same type of clothes that he found. The tramp runs away and Hoax gives chase, with other people helping the pursuit. Eventually, Hoax captures the tramp with the aid of a police officer, and returns to the victim's body with the man. Hoax then comes to a realization that the body was just a dummy that had been stuffed with the leaves. The crowd has a laugh at Hoax's expense while the two boys are punished.|$|E
5|$|Himmler's organised, bookish intellect {{served him}} well as he began setting up {{different}} SS departments. In 1931 he appointed Reinhard Heydrich chief of the new Ic Service (intelligence service), which was renamed the Sicherheitsdienst (SD: Security Service) in 1932. He later officially appointed Heydrich his deputy. The two men had a good working relationship and a mutual <b>respect.</b> <b>In</b> 1933, they began to remove the SS from SA control. Along with Interior Minister Frick, they hoped to create a unified German police force. In March 1933, Reich Governor of Bavaria Franz Ritter von Epp appointed Himmler chief of the Munich Police. Himmler appointed Heydrich commander of Department IV, the political police. That same year, Hitler promoted Himmler {{to the rank of}} SS-Obergruppenführer, equal in rank to the senior SA commanders. Thereafter, Himmler and Heydrich took over the political police of state after state; soon only Prussia was controlled by Göring.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Stainer {{was offered}} the post of Inspector of Music in Schools and Colleges, a {{position}} he took with great seriousness and which he occupied for six years. He worked towards raising standards in music teaching and toured the country, visiting schools and colleges and examining candidates. He advocated the use of musical notation and tonic sol-fa rather than the learning-by-ear method previously used. He was by now treated with the greatest <b>respect</b> <b>in</b> musical circles, but his many activities diminished the time available for composition. The flow of new anthems and service music slowed down, but in 1883 he completed his oratorio Mary Magdalen. This was followed in 1887 by The Crucifixion, the work {{for which he is}} most remembered.|$|E

She is also considered a fashion and art trendsetter, {{and for a long time}} she was associated with Madonna. In 2001, she had her first retrospective and in 2005, she published her first book on body painting. At the peak of her pop culture fame after the Vanity Fair cover, she was seriously considered for an Absolut Vodka Absolute Gair ad campaign. She has done magazine editorial work, and in 2005, she became a photographer of her own body paintings in both books and magazines.|$|E
5|$|In the {{standard}} periodic table, the elements {{are listed in}} order of increasing atomic number Z (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom). A new row (period) is started when a new electron shell has its first electron. Columns (groups) {{are determined by the}} electron configuration of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. oxygen and selenium are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some <b>respect</b> <b>in</b> the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{defense was}} less {{statistically}} successful in 2010 {{than it had}} been in previous years, but the Hokies still led the nation in turnover margin, forcing 16 more turnovers than they gave away. Sophomore cornerback Jayron Hosley, a first-team All-ACC selection, led the nation in interceptions with eight, while Davon Morgan and Rashad Carmichael each had four. Tech's defense ranked 10th in the red zone, seven spots ahead of the Seminoles' defense in that <b>respect.</b> <b>In</b> total defense, the Hokies were 42nd, permitting an average of 349 yards per game. In scoring defense, Tech was third in the ACC, permitting 17.9points per game.|$|E

Bulger, Jr. ran for the seat. Another lawyer, Patrick Loftus, also ran for the Democratic primary. The race grew from the grassroots of South Boston, with neighborhood issues such as development, crime, and education ruling the debate. The candidates declared their mutual <b>respect.</b> <b>In</b> a stunning victory, Lynch won the Democratic primary in March 1996, defeating Bulger Jr. and Loftus 56–35–9%. In April, he defeated Republican Richard William Czubinski 96–4% and was inaugurated on May 1, 1996. He won re-election unopposed in 1996, 1998, and 2000.|$|E
