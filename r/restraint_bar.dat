500|$|On July 19, 2013, a 52-year-old woman fell to {{her death}} while riding New Texas Giant. A park {{official}} released a statement saying, [...] "We are committed to determining {{the cause of this}} tragic accident and will utilize every resource throughout this process ...

The park completed its investigation stating on September 10, 2013, that mechanical failure was not to blame. The ride reopened on September 14, 2013, with all three trains featuring a re-designed <b>restraint</b> <b>bar,</b> pads, and seat belts.

500|$|The {{design of}} a Wing Coaster differs from many {{traditional}} steel roller coasters in that its trains are not located above or below the track but rather on the sides, a configuration that give riders the impression of free flight. Also, because there is nothing {{on top of the}} track and only steel beams holding each ends of the train together, all current Wing Coasters have an object (that relates to the theme) that covers the steel beams and adds to the experience. The restraints on the trains are also different. Instead of simply having the traditional over-the-shoulder <b>restraint</b> <b>bar</b> used on many inverted roller coasters, the Wing Coaster restraints similar to Bolliger & Mabillard's Flying Coaster which includes a [...] "cover" [...] and a waist-level restraint, with bars on the side for the rider to hold on to. The Wing Coaster's differences extended to the station layout of the station, which requires the queue to split in two halves, allowing riders to board the train where the seats sit level with the track.|$|E
50|$|Premier Rides {{gave the}} trains an {{overhaul}} in 2002 and replaced the <b>restraints</b> with lap <b>bars.</b>|$|R

25|$|On May 27, 2016, several {{passengers}} {{boarded the}} White Water Landing ride. The ride operator was {{not paying attention}} and started the ride without putting the <b>restraint</b> <b>bars</b> down. As the raft ascended the lift hill, the onboard guests started to panic and started yelling at the ride operators. One of the passengers stood up, {{trying to get the}} ride operator's attention. Soon after this, one of the ride operators realized what was going on, and stopped the ride. The same ride operator jumped onto the catwalk, and closed the restraints through a panel. The ride went through the layout normally. No injuries were reported, but some guests were shaken up. The ride operated normally {{for the rest of the}} day.|$|R

50|$|Each seat {{held two}} riders, and was {{equipped}} with a seat belt and <b>restraint</b> <b>bar.</b> Stationary cables kept each chute stabilized and in the correct position. Another cable actually moved the seat vertically. Inside the tower was one counterweight for each chute.|$|E
50|$|During {{the second}} EVA, a {{stainless}} steel palm <b>restraint</b> <b>bar</b> punctured the pressure bladder of Apt's right glove. However, the astronaut's hand and silk comfort glove partially sealed the hole, resulting in no detectable depressurization. In fact, the puncture was not noticed until postflight examination.|$|E

Existing four-car trains were {{converted}} to three-car trains (reducing seating capacity from 16 to 12), and anti-roll back features were installed. The lap <b>bar</b> <b>restraint</b> was retained, but seat belts and shoulder headrests were added.|$|R
50|$|Runaway Mine Train {{utilizes}} {{tubular steel}} rails {{similar to those}} used on the earlier Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland. This particular coaster has three lift hills and two tunnels. The ride's climax is the final drop after the third lift hill, where the track dives into a 150 ft curving tunnel below the park's Caddo Lake. This feature is notable as the world's first underwater coaster tunnel. The old-style Arrow Development cars were designed with <b>restraints</b> (lap <b>bars)</b> that can be released only manually.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of August 28, 2010, a rider on Rebel Yell {{suddenly}} found the safety <b>restraint</b> lap <b>bar</b> failing on {{the far end of}} the track, forcing them to hold on for the remainder of the ride, fearful of being ejected. As a safety precaution, the ride was closed for 3 days while technicians investigated the restraint system on the ride. An internal review by park officials later determined that the ride's staff on that morning had failed to follow park procedures for ensuring that the rider was properly secured before the ride.|$|R

50|$|Three major renovations {{have been}} made to this ride. One of the {{modifications}} was the addition of lap <b>bar</b> <b>restraints</b> in 2007, {{making it one of the}} few attractions of its type to use them, and most recently, an on-ride camera was added. Since then, some minor refurbishments have resulted in the ride being closed, though only for a day or two at a time.|$|R

5000|$|... 2. Whether, {{in light}} of this Court’s holding in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 1351, 1363 (2013), that the common law {{doctrine}} <b>barring</b> <b>restraints</b> on alienation that is the basis of exhaustion doctrine [...] "makes no geographical distinctions," [...] a sale of a patented article—authorized by the U.S. patentee—that takes place outside of the United States exhausts the U.S. patent rights in that article.|$|R
5000|$|Woodstock Express was {{recognized}} by the American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) as an [...] "ACE Coaster Classic" [...] but that status has since been rescinded {{as a result of}} recent changes to the coaster. Roller coasters with this designation must be wood, not steel, and meet certain operational and design criteria, including non-ratcheting lap <b>bar</b> <b>restraints,</b> no seat dividers or headrests, and free choice of seating for riders (over being assigned a seat by the operator).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{finite element}} {{software}} ANSYS/CivilFEM {{was applied to}} analyses the influence of steel <b>bar</b> <b>restraint</b> on creep and shrinkage of reinforced concrete. The analysis results are in good agreement with the experiment results. When the reinforcement ratio is low, the steel bar exerts less influence on creep and shrinkage, {{and the influence of}} steel bar can be neglected in engineering application. However, the reinforcement can effectively reduce creep and shrinkage development when the reinforcement ratio is high...|$|R
50|$|Mako {{operates}} {{with lead}} and fiberglass trains each containing seven cars. Every seat {{has its own}} lap <b>bar</b> <b>restraint</b> and each car seats four riders in a single row {{for a total of}} 28 riders per train. The trains were designed with the physiology of a mako with gills {{on either side of the}} train, and feature polyurethane wheels that help to reduce friction on the track. Moreover, they were manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard in Switzerland.|$|R
50|$|Woodstock Express was {{recognized}} by the American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) as an ACE Coaster Classic, and a plaque was awarded. The group has since removed the ride from their list due to design modifications which disqualify the ride.To be designated an ACE Coaster Classic, roller coasters must be made out of wood, not steel, and adhere to strict operational and design criteria including non-ratcheting lap <b>bar</b> <b>restraints,</b> no seat dividers or headrests, and free choice of seating for riders.|$|R
50|$|The {{roller coaster}} is now located in Colombian National Coffee Park, Montenegro, Quindio, Colombia, {{and is known}} as Broca.
