[...] Later work by David Autor in the mid-2000s identified multiple flaws in Miles' methodology, found that the implied contract exception decreased aggregate employment 0.8 to 1.6%, and confirmed the outsourcing phenomenon identified by Miles, but {{also found that the}} tort exceptions to at-will had no statistically significant influence. [...] Autor and colleagues later found in 2007 that the good faith exception does reduce job flows, and seems to cause labor productivity to rise but total factor productivity to drop. [...] In other words, employers forced to find a [...] "good faith" [...] reason to fire an employee tend to automate operations to avoid hiring new employees, but also suffer an impact on total productivity because of the increased difficulty in discharging unproductive employees. [...] Other researchers have found that at-will exceptions {{have a negative effect on}} <b>reemployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployed</b> (but not already employed) workers, and that hedonic regressions on at-will exceptions show large negative effects on individual welfare with regard to home values, rents, and wages.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} gains from {{unemployment}} insurance (UI) by measuring its im-pact on post-unemployment wages.

Lay-off (unemployed) participants {{for this study were}} recruited from four public employment centers in Beijing. participants completed two surveys. Results mainly demonstrated: 1 There were significant relationships between Job-seeking self-efficacy, motivation control and job-seeking frequency; age was negatively associated with job-seeking frequency and mental health; 2 Joh-seeking support was highlighted as the only lagged predictor <b>of</b> <b>reemployment</b> status; job-seeking frequency predicted job satisfaction of reemployed individuals; 3 The mental health of reemployed was significantly improved; but mental health <b>of</b> continously <b>unemployed</b> people deteriorated during these three months. High quality reemployment significantly improved mental health, low quality reemployment had no effect on mental health. The research demostrated some psychological factors predicting reemployment and relationships between reemployment and mental health.

The unemployment risk is broken down into the risk of entering unemployment and the risk, once <b>unemployed,</b> <b>of</b> not getting reemployed. The paper examines the impact of education on both risk components. France faces a higher unemployment rate than West-Germany, due to {{a higher risk of}} entering unemployment whereas the risk, when <b>unemployed,</b> <b>of</b> not getting reemployed is lower than in Germany. The risk of entering unemployment is particularly high for French employees with poor education, but higher education graduates face a higher risk <b>of</b> getting <b>unemployed</b> in Germany than in France.

40|$|Subsidised {{employment}} {{is an important}} tool of active labour market policies to improve the <b>reemployment</b> chances <b>of</b> the <b>unemployed.</b> Using unusually informative individual data from administrative records we investigate the effects of two different schemes of subsidised temporary employment implemented in Switzerland: non-profit employment programmes (EP) and a subsidy for temporary jobs (TEMP) in private and public firms. Econometric matching methods show that TEMP is more successful than EP in getting the unemployed back to work. Compared to not participating in any programme EP and TEMP are ineffective for unemployed who find jobs easily anyway or have a short unemployment spell. For potential and actual long term unemployed both programmes may have positive effects, but the effect of TEMP is larger.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to explore various {{difficulties}} in the process <b>of</b> <b>reemployment,</b> the focus <b>of</b> this study is how, to what extent, and in what way length of unemployment duration is generated by the interplay between the structural characteristics {{of the labor market}} and the individual characteristics <b>of</b> <b>unemployed</b> workers. The structural resources are conceptualized in terms of (1) different types <b>of</b> <b>reemployment,</b> and (2) economic sectors. It turns out that the insertion of labor market structures into research on unemployment duration is quite valuable in improving our understanding <b>of</b> individual <b>reemployment</b> behavior. The findings show that reemployment through job recalls is relatively easier than through job switches. Even though many unemployed workers remained to benefit from the structural buffer of internal labor markets in their struggle for reemployment, workers losing core-sector jobs are found to have more difficulty in switching to a new job relative to those losing peripheral jobs. The finding illustrates a critical weakness of internal labor markets in reallocating unemployed workers. Furthermore, the impact of the labor market location of lost jobs is also observed in both the manner {{and the extent to which}} the individual attributes <b>of</b> <b>unemployed</b> workers affect the process <b>of</b> <b>reemployment.</b> (1) More education substantially improves the <b>reemployment</b> chances <b>of</b> workers losing core-services jobs, but not workers unemployed from other sectors. (2) The <b>reemployment</b> probability <b>of</b> workers losing core-services jobs is increased with an improvement in general education whereas the <b>reemployment</b> probabilities <b>of</b> workers losing core goods-production jobs tend to increase with an accumulation in firm-specific skills. (3) Men tend to maintain their reemployment advantage through their access to internal labor markets whereas women improve their reemployment probability by benefiting from job expansion in service industries. (4) Experienced core-service workers tend to have a shorter unemployment duration than young ones when their jobs are available for recall, whereas experienced peripheral goods production workers often have a competitive disadvantage in switching to a new job. And (5) UI benefits slow down the job-recall rate substantially but have little impact on the individual behavior of searching for a new job. The problem of timing termination of unemployment duration to coincide with exhaustion of UI benefits is much more severe for the job-recall rate than for the job-switch rate...|$|R
