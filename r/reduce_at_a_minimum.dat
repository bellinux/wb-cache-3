40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the non-chemical performance against the Tribolium confosum, the influence of gamma irradiation in various doses on the young and aged adult. The insects were reared in a laboratory condition (27 ± 1 °C, RH; 65 ± 10 % and L: D, 8 : 16) and after gamma irradiation, they were kept in the same mentioned condition. Furthermore, the gamma ray effect on baking flour was studied before and after irradiation. Due to the primary tests, the extent of experienced does for the growth period of young-adult and mature-adult insects were determined. The young-adult and aged-adult insects {{were exposed to the}} selected doses and their mortality rate were registered after 24 h. The analysis showed that the killer does for 50 % of their population in the young and aged adult was 1223. 91 and 2296. 15 Gy in 3 days, respectively. This study supports the assertion that relatively low doses of irradiation can serve as a disinfestations treatment. Product damage could be significantly <b>reduced</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> irradiation dose while in high dose the mortality should take into the account...|$|R

40|$|For most {{bacterial}} pathogens, adherence of {{the bacterium}} {{to the surface}} of the host cell tissue is a necessary first step for colonization and infection. Agents that inhibit adherence, therefore, could be useful for preventing infections. The goal of this research was to assess the anti-adherent activity of several food-grade prebiotic carbohydrates, plant extracts, and other naturally-derived molecules against enteric pathogens. First, the antiadherent effect of galactooligosaccharides (GOS), polydextrose (PDX), and a GOS-PDX blend was tested against two strains of Cronobacter “Enterobacter” sakazakii. When measured microscopically or by cultural methods, significant reductions in adherence (56 % and 71 %, respectively) of C. sakazakii were observed in the presence of GOS (16 mg/ml). Adherence inhibition also occurred (48 %) when the GOS-PDX blend (8 mg/ml each) was tested, although PDX by itself had less effect. Subsequently, the ability of several prebiotic agents, including chitooligosaccharides (COS) and mannan oligosaccharides derived from yeast cell walls (MOSy) and konjac root (MOSk), to inhibit adherence of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohemorragic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and Salmonella typhimurium to a human HEp- 2 cell line was tested. In addition, a high molecular weight component of cranberry (CHMW) was also assessed for anti-adherence. Different fractions of COS significantly reduced adherence of EPEC <b>at</b> <b>a</b> concentration of 16 mg/ml. Although MOSy inhibited EPEC, EHEC, and S. typhumiurim, adherence inhibition was not observed for MOSk. Adherence inhibition of EPEC, EHEC, and S. typhumiurim by CHMW was observed. Finally, the ability of two different types of lactoferrin to inhibit adherence of Cronobacter sakazakii to a HEp- 2 human cell line was assessed. Results showed that the adherence of C. sakazakii was significantly <b>reduced</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> concentration of 10 mg/ml. However, at higher concentrations (up to 50 mg/ml), further reductions in adherence were not observed. These results show that different prebiotics, plant extracts, and other molecules may be added to foods as a prophylactic treatment to prevent or mitigate infections by enteric pathogens.

30|$|Fenton {{oxidation}} sometimes gives inefficient degradation {{because of}} iron-organic complexes [11, 12]. Liu et al. [13] investigated {{the effect of}} four flavonoids, i.e., baicilein, luteolin, naringenin, and quercetin suppressing the rate of Fenton reaction. They used the electrochemically <b>reduced</b> iron(III)-ATP complex <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> ratio of flavonoid to iron of 1.5 : 1 at pH 7.4. The rate is suppressed in the order as, quercetin > luteolin > naringenin > baicilein. The catechol group in quercetin and luteolin structure enhances iron chelation. Roy et al. [14] proposed a possible degradation mechanism of tropaeolin using iron under oxidizing conditions. Iron-chelate complexes, as well as hydroquinone and quinone compounds, are also identified by mass spectroscopy.|$|R

The core of the framework is an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) used to control crop model runs, assimilate remote sensing (RS) data and update model state variables. We modified the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer – Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM) -Maize model (Jones et al., 2003) {{to be able to}} stop and start simulations at any given time in the growing season, such that the EnKF can update model state variables as RS data become available. The data assimilation-crop modeling framework was evaluated against 2003 – 2009 maize yields in Story County, Iowa, USA, assimilating AMSR-E soil moisture and MODIS-LAI data independently and simultaneously. Assimilating LAI or soil moisture independently slightly improved the correlation of observed and simulated yields (R= 0. 51 and 0. 50) compared to no data assimilation (open-loop; R= 0. 47) but prediction errors improved with reductions in MBE and RMSE by 0. 5 and 0. 5 Mgha− 1 respectively for LAI assimilation while these were reduced by 1. 8 and 1. 1 Mgha− 1 for soil moisture assimilation. Yield correlation improved more when both soil moisture and LAI were assimilated (R= 0. 65) suggesting a cause–effect interaction between soil moisture and LAI, prediction errors (MBE and RMSE) were also reduced by 1. 7 and 1. 8 Mgha− 1 with respect to open-loop simulations. Results suggest that assimilation of LAI independently might be preferable when conditions are extremely wet while assimilation of soil moisture+LAI might be more suitable when conditions are more nominal. AMSR-E soil moisture tends to be more biased under the presence of high vegetation (i. e., when crops are fully developed) and that updating rootzone soil moisture by near-surface soil moisture assimilation under very wet conditions could increase the modeled percolation causing excessive nitrogen (N) leaching hence reducing crop yields even with water stress <b>reduced</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> due to soil moisture assimilation. However, applying the data assimilation-crop modeling framework strategically by considering a-priori information on climate condition expected during the growing season may improve yield prediction performance substantially, in our case with higher correlation (R= 0. 80) and more reductions in MBE and RMSE (2. 5 and 3. 3 Mgha− 1) compared to when there is no data assimilation. Scaling AMSR-E soil moisture to the climatology of the model did not improve our data assimilation results because the model is also biased. Better soil moisture products e. g., from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, may solve the soil moisture data issue in the near future...|$|R

40|$|The {{strategic}} organizational change aims is {{the change}} of procedures and systems, organizational structures and responsibilities but especially acquiring new knowledge and skills. Significant authors (Drucker: 1999; Kotter: 1996; Buckingham n Clifton: 2001), supporters {{of the theory of}} strategic leadership show an inclination for the idea of optimal management of an organization, which depends on circumstantial factors as place and time, the individual and the context in which it acts. Many experts who studied organizational change saw as possible the future replacement of the current state, desired only after completion of specific phases, in a certain sequence. In this article we will focus our attention on the reduction phase of resistance to change. The research objectives targeted both theoretical aspects consisting in bringing to the forefront the relevant aspects related to organizational change in the current context and practical aspects related to identifying and analyzing the main elements that make it possible or on the contrary act as brakes in way of introduction and implementation of change. To achieve the research objectives, we used the method of direct observation and the questionnaire method supported by the gathering of more information from the organization's documents (Beton Construct SRL) and support discussions with the employees. Data processing and analysis revealed that in the organization certain factors exist and manifest that constitute obstacles or inhibit organizational change, namely: the goal of the change is not clear, the rewards of change are not related to the effort needed to make them happen, change determines fear of failure, change is often imposed by coercion, change requires effort and commitment required for employees that think they do not have resources anymore. Summarizing the results of usage for certain methods and techniques to implement change, we can say that the actions of an authoritarian management must be <b>reduced</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> necessary <b>minimum</b> and positive communication and motivation must be improved of those who contributed to the change. Setting up an effective system to implement changes towards achieving and maintaining performance in our case, limited in time and space at contemporary bihorean space, like practical implication of our study, appears to be related to direct communication, the concentration of communication on solutions and not on problems, creating a climate of trust, time allocation and reconsideration for the notion of failure...|$|R
40|$|Graves´disease is a {{very rare}} {{autoimmune}} disease in pediatrics. To date, no causal therapy is available and all therapeutic options carry risks. Most children are treated with antithyroid drugs (ATD) as the initial modality although the persistent remission following discontinuation is only about 30 %. The optimal duration and administration of ATD are discussed controversially. In the titration regime the dose of ATD is progressively <b>reduced</b> and maintained <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> dose required to maintain euthyroidism. In the block-and-replace regime (BRR) higher doses of ATD are combination with thyroxine. Evidence based guidelines are missing {{due to a lack}} of data. In this study, for the first time, the therapeutic success rate of long-term BRR ATD in pediatrics was investigated in a retrospective monocentric analysis. The records of 51 children primary diagnosed and treated in the BRR between 1995 and 2013 were retrospectively studied. 27 fulfilled the additional criteria of ATD discontinuation and an 18 months follow-up after. The remission rate 18 months after the end of ATD administration, the rate of side effects and the influence of several factors potentially modifying the outcome in this cohort was analyzed. In the cohort (n= 27), the remission rate of 56 % 18 months after stopping ATD was higher than in most other studies. The rate of side effects observed (26 %) was also higher but no correlation between side effect rate and ATD dose was found. Favorable factors regarding outcome were young age at diagnosis (p= 0, 047) and a higher initial thiamazol dose (p= 0, 074). Due to lack of a matched control group, however, a causal relationship between the favorable outcome and the therapeutic regime employed cannot be derived. Therefore prospective randomized clinical trials, directly comparing both regimes, are needed. Until then, given the good remission rate and the lack of severe side effects in this study, the BRR should be considered a good treatment option in pediatrics. Increased reduction of endogenous thyroid function by higher ATD doses in combination with thyroxine might be beneficial. Likewise the long initial treatment might have had a positive impact on the good remission rate in this cohort. At least two years of ATD therapy seem reasonable. Younger patients with unstable metabolic situation could benefit from long-term BRR ATD. Concern about increasing side effect is partly justified but may be accepted given the rather high remission rate...|$|R
