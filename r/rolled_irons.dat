50|$|The School of Arts {{building}} is a two-storey masonry building elevated above Ann Street. The lower level is of coursed rubble masonry with red brick quoins and string courses. The upper two levels of the building are entirely brick, with the arched headed openings symmetrically arranged. The <b>rolled</b> <b>iron</b> hipped roof is surmounted by a 15-foot (4.6 metre) lantern light with projecting eaves.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} {{employed the}} most advanced fireproofing methods then available, {{including the use of}} <b>rolled</b> <b>iron</b> beams, cast iron columns, brick exterior walls [...] - [...] its walls are 40 in thick at ground level [...] - [...] tile arches and terra-cotta. Its terra-cotta detailing provoked the developer, Orlando B. Potter, to start his own terra cotta company on Long Island.|$|R
50|$|For instance, two {{processes}} {{were used}} in constructing iron armor. In the first, hammering, large lumps of iron of scrap or puddled iron were heated to welding temperature and placed under heavy steel hammers. Repeated blows welded these lumps into one solid plate and shaped it to the required form and dimensions. Hammered iron plate was the armor used in the earliest ironclad vessels, including HMS Warrior. The second method, rolling, involved stacking iron lumps atop one another, heating them to welding temperature and passing them between two iron rollers to become one plate of the required size. <b>Rolled</b> <b>iron</b> was difficult to produce initially, as it required machinery of immense size and great power. However, when the Special Committee tested both types of plate in 1863, it found that <b>rolled</b> <b>iron</b> was superior to hammered due to greater uniformity in quality. The committee and iron manufacturers worked together on how to more easily produce rolled plate, which became standard use in warships beginning in 1865.|$|R
50|$|George Sitwell (1601 - 1667), {{the eldest}} son of George Sitwell (1569-1607) and Mary Walker, was a 17th-century {{landowner}} and ironmaster who was born at Eckington in Derbyshire and baptized there on 15 March 1601. He built Renishaw Hall in Derbyshire in 1626. His company mined, forged, and <b>rolled</b> <b>iron</b> for use in Britain and overseas. It exported a complete rolling mill to the West Indies.|$|R

50|$|Advances in {{the iron}} and steel {{industries}} allowed the new forts to use armor in innovative ways. In 1875, the Mougin system of laminated armor using <b>rolled</b> <b>iron</b> was first used in casemates to provide protection against field guns. <b>Rolled</b> <b>iron</b> gave way to cast iron, providing protection against siege guns. Mougin also devised the Mougin turret, a revolving cast iron turret for 155 mm guns. Cast iron was not altogether suitable for protection against explosive shells and its use was discontinued in 1882. In 1885, steel was substituted for cast iron. Such non-retractable, or non-eclipsing turrets could avoid direct-fire damage to their gun embrasures, only by facing away {{from the direction of}} fire. Eclipsing turrets were developed that could retract {{in the face of such}} attack, leaving only their top surfaces exposed. Such turrets were expensive and complex, with serious problems of noise and ventilation but were shown to be effective. Where possible, casemated artillery was used, due to the lower cost of such an emplacement. While heavy armament was being armored, lighter armament and observers were also protected. A range of armored machine gun and observation positions were developed and were widely installed.|$|R

5000|$|A {{couple of}} things {{happened}} shortly after the American Revolution that would quickly change exterior shutter hardware. Machines were invented to make screws. Machines were invented to produce <b>rolled</b> <b>iron</b> in thin sheets. By about 1800 cheap screws were readily available. Cast iron technology had long been available - now machine made screws allowed such hardware to be economically mounted. A bunch of butt type hinges can be seen during this [...] "Federal" [...] Period (1800-1830) - but they quickly fell from favor, probably because they were subject to breakage.|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} laid with MacDonnell's patent {{permanent}} way, consisting of bridge rails weighing 51 lbs and longitudinal <b>rolled</b> <b>iron</b> sleepers weighing 60 lbs to the lineal yard, which are secured {{to each other}} by screw bolts and nuts. The gauge is preserved by angle iron cross-ties, nine feet apart; and a strip of wood has been inserted between the rails and sleepers to prevent rigidity. This description of permanent way has been already tried on the Bristol & Exeter Railway, and with such success as to induce the Company to lay down an additional portion of it.|$|R
50|$|The visible {{portion of}} the turret was 6 m in diameter, in cast and <b>rolled</b> <b>iron</b> of four {{segments}} 60 cm thick, with a fifth casting forming the 20 cm thick top. The rotating gun and turret assembly weighed 160 tons, rotating on a circular rail around a hydraulically supported pivot. The movement of the turret initially required three teams of six men. After 1901 steam engines were installed to replace men. A full revolution took about two minutes, enough time to reload before the target azimuth was obtained again. Elevation varied from -5 degrees to +20 degrees.|$|R

25|$|In 1863, {{development}} {{along the}} banks of Potrero Point consisted of two powder magazines on the southern side of the steep peninsula, located so as to keep dangerous commodities away from populated areas. Heavy industry first located on the point in 1866 when six wealthy San Francisco industrialists came together to organize the Pacific Rolling Mills with the plan to <b>roll</b> <b>iron</b> from scrap, in the hope of producing homegrown iron products, including railroad iron. Access to deep water was a necessity for delivering coal from Australia to fuel the mills, firebrick and clay from Liverpool and scrap iron from around the Pacific Rim and as far away as England.|$|R
50|$|From the 1840s, boiler barrels were {{constructed}} from hoops of <b>rolled</b> <b>iron,</b> or later steel, sheet. As boilers were {{longer than the}} width of the available iron sheet, two or three hoops were required. For strength, the dome was always placed in the centre of a hoop, rather than spanning a joint. Early boilers used narrow plates and thus had a centrally located dome, in the centre of the middle hoop. Later boilers could use the wider plates then available and used two hoops, so as {{to reduce the number of}} riveted joints. These domes were thus placed at a quarter of the barrel's length (from the front of the firebox wrapper).|$|R
50|$|The western {{facade of}} the {{building}} has a centrally located 5-sided projection which is only mid height of the facade and houses internally a baptismal font. This small projection is roofed with a <b>rolled</b> <b>iron</b> pyramidal roof from a sandstone wall capping. Sandstone quoining is found on the corners of this small projection and around several small lancets {{on each of the}} faces. This sandstone quoining is repeated on the {{facade of the}} building, around the tripartite lancet windows centrally located above the baptismal projection. Flanking the projection are attached sandstone buttresses tapering toward the roof and demarcating a change in roof line which is more shallow over the internal side aisles.|$|R
50|$|Whilst thus {{dismissed}} the passenger station constructed was a substantial single storeyed stone building, with rendered brick portico of classical derivation. A stone kitchen was built {{adjacent to the}} station building. An early description of the passenger station describes verandah awnings attached to {{the eastern side of}} the building which provide shelter over the platforms. The awnings were supported on cast iron columns on stone bases and with cast iron brackets from the top. This awning was replaced in September 1934 when the extant steel cantilevered awnings were constructed. According to early photographs of the building, the roof of the passenger station was originally covered with a both <b>rolled</b> <b>iron</b> sections and corrugated iron sections.|$|R
50|$|St Luke's is {{a finely}} {{detailed}} brick {{building in the}} Romanesque style whose predominant feature is the massive relieving archway containing vertical openings {{at the end of}} the chancel. It has a complicated roof form combining both hips and gables, along with a small octagonal tower near the entry. The roof sheeting is <b>rolled</b> <b>iron.</b> The plain brickwork is punctuated by bands of different coloured brick and the occasional use of stone around windows and doors. The building has the unusual arrangement of having entries to both floor levels at the chancel end in an attempt to optimise the building's orientation. The major entry to the upper church level is defined by a recessed porch.|$|R
40|$|Problem statement. Each scale level detectesthe new {{features}} {{of the structure of}} the material describing of it quality. For example, {{features of the}} grain structure are revealed in different kind of steel on microstruc ture level, and its parameters greatly influences on the strength properties of the metal. Thus, to select the scale of representation of a fractal object, for instance the elements of structure of <b>roll</b> <b>iron</b> or steel is necessary to determine the interval (1), where observed its self-similarity, and on this interval should be selected the scale, the use of which will allow him to choose adequate fractal dimension. For optimal scale structure of repose is taken one in which at least two adjacent points of the series (2), the fractal dimension is minimal differences between them. This is explained by the fact that this is best observed property of self-similarity structure. An example of the selection of the scale representation of the structure of cast <b>iron</b> <b>rolls</b> execution of SPHN (a) and execution SSHN (b) is shown on interval of increases in the range of x 100 to x 1000 with a predetermined pitch Δl = 100. The implementation of this phase of research allowed to determine experimentally the optimal scale of representation of structure of <b>iron</b> <b>roll</b> with increasing x 200 for multifractal analysis of its elements: inclusion of the plate and nodular graphit, carbides.
