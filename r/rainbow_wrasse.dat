40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} infections due to antibiotic resistant bacteria {{has led to}} renewed interest in bacteriophages (= phages) and phage therapy. Although phage therapy {{has been applied to}} control bacterial diseases in plants, poultry, livestock and humans, its application in aquaculture is still relatively limited. The emergence of phage-resistant bacterial mutants has been considered {{to be one of the}} major limitations of phage therapy. This study aimed to (i) isolate and characterise phages; (ii) select phages and their bacterial hosts to set up in vivo phage therapy models with aquaculture animals, and estimate the efficiency of phage therapy; (iii) investigate the generation and characteristics of phage-resistant mutants, and thus estimate the consequence of applying phage therapy when phage-resistant mutants emerge; and (iv) discuss the prospects for application of phages in aquaculture. Two Vibrio isolates and their phages were isolated from a Scottish marine fish farm. Based on the results of conventional phenotype testing and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, the two vibrios, V 9 and V 13, were identified as Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio cyclitrophicus, respectively. The bacterial characteristics including morphology, temperature and salinity range of growth, production of extracellular enzymes, and the possession of virulence genes were examined. According to the morphological characteristics observed using transmission electron microscopy by negative staining, phage PVS 9 of V. splendidus V 9 was identified as a myophage, while phage PVC 13 of V. cyclitrophicus V 13 was identified as a siphophage. The phages could only lyse one bacterial host strain and their genomic DNA was double stranded with a size of 46 kb. The two Vibrio isolates were found to be non- or of low virulence to <b>rainbow</b> trout, goldsinny <b>wrasse</b> and Artemia in pathogenicity experiments. Thus an in vivo phage therapy model could not be set up using these Vibrio isolates and their phages. Two phages pAS- 3 and pAS- 6 were isolated using the Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida Hooke strain as the host. Phages pAS- 3 and pAS- 6 had a similar genome size of 50 kb, and the same relatively narrow host range within A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida strains. The siphophage pAS- 3 formed clear plaques and inhibited A. salmonicida Hooke growth in vitro completely for at least 18 hours when using MOI = 1, 000, whereas the podophage pAS- 6 formed turbid plaques and weakly inhibited Hooke growth. Rainbow trout exposed by intraperitoneal injection with 0. 1 mL of the raw phage preparations at a concentration of 108 PUF mL- 1 showed no adverse effects over 14 days. In the phage therapy trial, fish were firstly injected with 1 x 102 CFU fish- 1 of A. salmonicida Hooke, then immediately injected with phage preparations of pAS- 3 and pAS- 6, respectively, using MOI = 10, 000. Compared with the control group (which did not receive phage treatment), phage treated groups showed a delay in the time to death, and lower mortalities. However, the mortalities and time to death between phage treated and non-treated groups were not significantly different. Phage-resistant mutants of pathogenic A. salmonicida strain Hooke were induced by repeatedly challenging with phage pAS- 3. One of the mutants, termed HM, was chosen to compare the characteristics with the parental wild-type strain Hooke. Test results including the formation of ‘smooth’ colonies on TSA, autoagglutination negative, the formation of creamy colonies on Coomassie Brilliant Blue agar, and the degradation of a thick/furry layered structure on the cell surface indicated a deficiency of the A-layer in the phage-resistant mutant HM. Therefore, it was deduced that the A-layer either directly acted as the receptor of A. salmonicida phage pAS- 3, or was affected indirectly by the change of an unknown phage receptor. The greater wax moth larvae model was used to compare the virulence of the phage-resistant mutant HM and the parental wild-type strain Hooke, as it is an ethically acceptable animal model, which has the advantages of being low cost and convenient for injection, and is also a recognised alternative model for bacterial pathogens of fish. The results showed that virulence of the phage-resistant mutant HM did not decline in the greater wax moth larvae model compared with that of the parental wild-type strain Hooke. In conclusion, different approaches were used to isolate and characterise phages from different aquaculture environments for potential use in phage therapy. A rainbow trout model was set up using pathogenic A. salmonicida strain Hooke and two A. salmonicida phages pAS- 3 and pAS- 6. The use of phage treatment led to lower cumulative mortalities and delay to the time of death, although the differences between the groups were not significant, futher work is required to determine if these phages have potential in phage therapy. The consequence of applying phage therapy when phage-resistant mutants emerge was estimated based on their characteristics and virulence, and no decline in virulence of the phage-resistant mutant from this study indicates the importance of fully testing the virulence of phage-resistant mutants before carrying out large scale field trials of phage therapy. It appears feasible to use phage therapy as an alternative approach to control bacterial infections in aquaculture, but further studies are required to focus on improving effectiveness, and also to overcome the concrete limitations and hurdles in application and commercialisation. Moreover, a broader range of applications of phages in aquaculture should be explored...|$|R

40|$|Several growth {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} tested to investigate why males of the sequential hermaphrodite, Mediterranean <b>rainbow</b> <b>wrasse,</b> Coris julis (Linnaeus, 1758), are relatively larger than females of the same age. Individual growth trajectories were estimated to test these hypotheses. A good linear relationship between otolith size and body size was observed (r 2 = 0. 71, n = 609), thus, past somatic growth of any specific fish can be inferred from the longitudinal data described by the width of annual increments in the otolith. These data were successfully analyzed by a non-linear mixed-effect model (von Bertalanffy growth model) using a Bayesian approach. The results obtained suggest that Mediterranean <b>rainbow</b> <b>wrasse</b> secondary males are relatively larger than females because 1) fish that change sex are already the larger individuals in their age group (specifically those with higher growth rate, ksecondary males = 0. 199 and kfemales = 0. 161) and 2) they experience a growth spurt after sex change.

The quantity of the reproductive output (batch fecundity) was significantly related to maternal size, which is of special interest in a species submitted to size-selective harvesting (recreational angling). However, egg quality (egg size) was not significantly related to any maternal factor and the spawning fraction was related to a seasonal pattern only.

Samples from a site at the Moroccan Mediterranean coast in the Alboran Sea showed intermediate frequencies of “Mediterranean” and “Atlantic” haplotypes.

40|$|Long {{wavelength}} colours (lambda > 580 nm) often {{serve as}} visual signals during inter-and intrasexual interactions in various species of freshwater fish. However, while long wavelength colours are also prevalent in many marine fish, their functional importance remains largely unknown. Here, we {{demonstrate that the}} presence of long wavelength colours mediate intra specific aggressive interactions in the Mediterranean <b>rainbow</b> <b>wrasse</b> Coris julis. By manipulating the relative mixture of red (lambda(max) = 628 nm) and blue (lambda(max) = 454 nm) light in experimental tanks, we created conditions in which discrimination of long wavelength colours from colours of shorter wavelength was either possible or prevented. We found that resident males {{were significantly more likely to}} attack conspecific intruder males when discrimination was enabled compared to conditions where no such discrimination was possible. Aggression from residents was associated with the display of a red (lambda(max) = 611 nm) colour patch on the dorsal fin of intruders, but not the size of the putative signal. Our findings suggest that long wavelength colours are an important component of marine visual ecology by mediating agonistic male-male interactions...|$|E
40|$|Climate warming should favor ‘warm water’ species over ‘cold water’ {{species at}} the same site. Regional warming in the Western Mediterranean has allowed the {{documented}} northward expansion of southern marine species. Conversely, very little is known on the response of cold loving species to temperature variations. We propose to work with two common coastal fishes: the <b>rainbow</b> <b>wrasse</b> Coris julis and the ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo, with the general objective to exploring patterns of distribution and their potential to interact under warming conditions. Large scale quantitative observations revealed: (1) opposing trends in abundance along latitudinal (35 o − 45 oN) and depth gradients (0 - 36 m), with T. pavo densities significantly higher in southern and shallow waters than those of C. julis; (2) differential distributions across shallow habitats, with C. julis occupying seagrass beds when the density of T. pavo was high; and (3) a marked depth segregation of the species only on steep coasts. These patterns are discussed {{with regard to the}} role of water warming. Significant ecological changes might occur in locations where the density of T. pavo is recently increasing...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{the shore}} {{topography}} (e. g. slope) occur at {{a scale of}} hundreds of meters in several locations in the Lusitanian and the Mediterranean Sea provinces. We tested whether differences in the bottom inclination might affect the vertical distribution patterns of two sympatric coastal labrid fishes, the <b>rainbow</b> <b>wrasse</b> Coris julis and the ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo. Visual censuses {{were used to determine}} the distribution and abundance of these labrid species in high (‡ 30) and low (£ 3) slope rocky substrates covered by brown macroalgae and at two different depths (shallow, 4 – 7 m, and deep 14 – 20 m). Pectoral fin aspect ratio was used as an estimate of swimming performance to potentially explain the patterns observed. Despite the intrinsic biogeographical differences in the overall density of T. pavo and C. julis, on steep coasts the ornate wrasse dominated in shallow waters, whereas the two species coexisted both in shallow and deeper depths on gentle slope coasts. These distribution patterns were consistent across locations, and fin aspect ratio was not a good predictor of between-habitat use for wrasses. We show that, under specific topographical conditions, the depth segregation pattern seems to be an interactive segregation (likely related to resource competition) rather than a result of selective segregation due to morphological differences in the pectoral fin. Significant ecological changes might occur in locations where the density of T. pavo has recently increased as a result of water warming...|$|E
40|$|Background. There is {{need for}} more {{information}} on behavioural rhythms of fishes in relation to their habitat use in few or not previously monitored areas, such as coralligenous habitats. Some studies have compiled inventories of observable fish species in this habitat, but no studies have been performed on the temporal patterning of fish behaviour, especially at the scale of the day. The presently reported study aims at providing knowledge on finescale fluctuations of abundances and behaviour of two fish species in coralligenous habitats throughout the diurnal period. Materials and methods. Fish fauna was filmed hourly, for several days, from dusk to dawn, with autonomous, programmable, and rotating video systems. Diurnal variations in abundances per count, considering size classes and behaviour, were studied for two diurnal fish species-the Mediterranean <b>rainbow</b> <b>wrasse,</b> Coris julis (Linnaeus, 1758) (Labridae), and the common two-banded seabream, Diplodus vulgaris (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1817) (Sparidae) in two study areas of coralligenous habitats on the French Riviera. Results. Significant temporal variability at the scale of the hour was revealed for abundances of C. julis in one of the two study areas, with few individuals in crepuscular periods and highest abundances in the morning and in the afternoon. These differences were mainly due to significant diurnal variations in abundances of small and medium C. julis, which were low in crepuscular periods, whereas large-sized individuals were equally abundant during the day. On the other hand, no discernible diurnal rhythmicity of mean abundances of D. vulgaris was observed, regardless of the study area. Crepuscular periods were associated with sudden changes of abundances and behaviour for both species, with a greater percentage of mobile and solitary individuals, and few feeding individuals compared {{to the rest of the}} day. Feeding occurred mainly in the morning for C. julis. In contrast, no dial-time preference for feeding was revealed for D. vulgaris. Conclusions. The study provided preliminary insights into fine-scale diurnal variations of abundances of different life stages and of fish behaviour. Variability in abundances of life stages and of fish behaviours at different times of day should be taken into account for population assessments and spatial comparisons. Moreover, our study confirmed the use of video-imaging as an efficient non-destructive tool for the study of fish fauna in structurally complex, highly valuable habitats...|$|E
