50|$|It {{could be}} {{regarded}} as having its distant origins in the escapement invented by Robert Robin, C.1792, which gives a single impulse in one direction; with the locking achieved by passive lever pallets, {{the design of the}} coaxial escapement is more akin to that of another Robin variant, the Fasoldt escapement, which was invented and patented by the American Charles Fasoldt in 1859.Both Robin and Fasoldt escapements give impulse in one direction only.The latter escapement has a lever with unequal drops; this engages with two escape wheels of differing diameters. The smaller impulse wheel acts on the single pallet {{at the end of the}} lever, whilst the pointed lever pallets lock on the larger wheel.The balance engages with and is impelled by the lever through a <b>roller</b> <b>pin</b> and lever fork. The lever 'anchor' pallet locks the larger wheel and, on this being unlocked, a pallet on the end of the lever is given an impulse by the smaller wheel through the lever fork. The return stroke is 'dead', with the 'anchor' pallets serving only to lock and unlock, impulse being given in one direction through the single lever pallet.As with the duplex, the locking wheel is larger in order to reduce pressure and thus friction.|$|E

This is a novel way of testing the lubrication by using loaded operating chains and sprockets. A test rig {{has been designed to}} operate chains and sprockets in a clean environment and allow direct comparison between different lubricants. The advantage of this method over previous techniques is that it allows the differentiation of lubricants in a more controlled operating environment and evaluates the overall lubricant performance as opposed to individual properties. The lubricants tested were a wax spray, PTFE spray and drip fed light oil. The test rig allowed measurement of the power saved by the lubricant in running the chains and sprockets. Chain length and component masses were also taken before and after running the chains and sprockets under load on the test rig. The results clearly show that any lubricant is preferable to none. The drip fed oil provided the greatest power saving and wear protection between the chain <b>rollers</b> and <b>pins</b> and the spray lubricants provided the highest level of protection between rollers and sprockets...|$|R

40|$|As train {{loads and}} travel speeds have {{increased}} over time, railway axle bearings have become critical elements which require more efficient non-destructive inspection and fault diagnostics methods. This paper presents a novel and adaptive procedure based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and Hilbert marginal spectrum for multi-fault diagnostics of axle bearings. EEMD overcomes the limitations that often hypothesize about data and computational efforts that restrict {{the application of}} signal processing techniques. The outputs of this adaptive approach are the intrinsic mode functions that are treated with the Hilbert transform {{in order to obtain}} the Hilbert instantaneous frequency spectrum and marginal spectrum. Anyhow, not all the IMFs obtained by the decomposition should be considered into Hilbert marginal spectrum. The IMFs’ confidence index arithmetic proposed in this paper is fully autonomous, overcoming the major limit of selection by user with experience, and allows the development of on-line tools.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} for modeling and simulating roller-chain drives using multibody formulations.

The bushing-link is modeled with two descendent dynamic bodies to represent the <b>rollers.</b> The adjacent <b>pin</b> and bushing links are connected by compliant bushing force elements. An efficient search algorithm is used to detect the contact between the roller and the sprocket teeth while a nonlinear force module is used to predict the contact force. A generalized sprocket representation is used to model the sprocket. The spatial motion of the chain links allows the out-of-plane vibrational motion of the links as well as simulating sprockets misalignment. Using the compliant connection between links avoids using the iterative calculation needed to satisfy the joint constraint equations leading to more efficient calculation scheme. The nonlinear dynamic equations of motion are solved using recursive approach.

25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated <b>rollers</b> and a <b>pinned</b> feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities.

Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid.

40|$|Tese de Doutoramento em Engenharia de Segurança ao Incêndio, apresentada à Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade de CoimbraA construção metálica é uma tecnologia cada vez mais corrente na construção civil que se baseia essencialmente na utilização de perfis pré-fabricados de aço estrutural. Estes, por sua vez, encontram-se em três formas distintas, nomeadamente, em perfis laminados a quente, em perfis soldados ou em perfis enformados a frio. Estes últimos, relativamente aos outros, têm fundamentalmente a vantagem de facilidade de produção, montagem e transporte, devido ao baixo peso dos perfis, conferido pelas espessuras reduzidas dos mesmos. No entanto, o facto de estes apresentarem estas espessuras pode originar a ocorrência de fenómenos de instabilidade local e distorcional. Neste sentido, diversos autores estudam {{experimental}} e numericamente estes fenómenos à temperatura ambiente. Outro fenómeno também problemático é quando os elementos de aço enformados a frio estão sujeitos ao fogo, existindo neste caso muito poucos estudos. Deste modo, este trabalho de investigação teve como objectivo estudar o comportamento de vigas em aço galvanizado enformadas a frio em situação de incêndio, com base num vasto programa de ensaios experimentais. Ensaios de flexão de quatro pontos foram assim realizados com o intuito de avaliar a influência (i) do tipo de secção transversal das vigas (secções C, I-enrijecido, R e 2 R), (ii) da restrição axial à elongação térmica (0 e 15 kN/mm) e (iii) da restrição rotacional nos apoios (0 e 150 kN. m/rad). Por outro lado, como referência, ainda foram efectuados ensaios à temperatura ambiente para a determinação da carga de instabilidade das respectivas vigas, assim como, dos seus modos de instabilidade que foram responsáveis pela perda de capacidade de carga da mesma, a fim de comparar com os ensaios a altas temperaturas. Estas vigas, normalmente utilizadas nos edifícios com perfis aço enformados a frio, tinham 3000 mm de vão e eram compostas por um ou mais perfis de aço enformados (perfis C e U) aparafusados entre si, os quais tinham 2. 5 mm de espessura, 43 mm de banzo e 250 mm de altura para os perfis C e 255 mm para os perfis U. O estudo experimental foi também complementado por uma intensiva análise numérica através do programa de elementos finitos ABAQUS. Neste domínio foi realizado um estudo paramétrico de modo a avaliar ainda o efeito da altura (entre 200 e 300 mm) e da espessura (entre 1, 5 e 2, 5 mm) das secções transversais das vigas, do comprimento do vão das mesmas (entre 2000 e 5000 mm) e, ainda, de outros valores de rigidezes de restrição axial (entre 0 e infinita) e rotacional (entre 0 e 1200 kN. m/rad) no desempenho estrutural deste tipo de vigas quando submetidas ao fogo. Finalmente, com recurso a esta base de dados procurou-se comparar os resultados com as disposições estabelecidas no Eurocódigo 3, para o aço laminado a quente, e propor possíveis novas equações simplificadas de cálculo para o dimensionamento de vigas em aço enformadas a frio, em situação de incêndio. As principais conclusões deste trabalho de investigação foram essencialmente que as vigas de aço enformadas a frio correntemente utilizadas neste tipo de edifícios apresentam uma resistência ao fogo baixa (inferior que 30 minutos), mas temperaturas críticas elevadas (maiores que 350 ºC, isto é, temperaturas superiores ao limite recomendado pelo Eurocódigo 3, Parte 1. 2, para elementos de classe 4), na maioria das situações. Por outro lado, verificou-se que as temperaturas críticas das vigas podem reduzir substancialmente (30 % em alguns casos) quando são restringidas à elongação térmica. Contudo, esta diminuição pode ser atenuada quando a restrição à rotação dos apoios da viga é significativa, comparativamente com a restrição rotacional da respectiva viga. The {{steel construction}} is increasingly an important technology for civil building. Actually, {{the steel industry}} is constantly in search of more and better uses for steel. The uses of hot-rolled, welded and cold-formed steel elements {{in the construction of}} buildings are ones of the solutions that can easily replace the traditional technology of construction. Indeed, cold-formed steel is one of which are becoming a very popular material in construction because they provide a high strength to weight ratio, are easy to produce, transport and assembly when compared to thicker hot-rolled steel members. Another advantage is the great variety of profiles available on the market which allow the building of different member cross-sections. However, they may behave poorly under fire conditions, especially when they are unprotected in fire case, due to the combination of the high thermal conductivity of steel and section factor of these structural members (small wall thickness), both of which lead to a rapid rise of temperature in steel in fire situation. In addition, cold-formed steel members usually have complex buckling behaviour, involving local, distortional, global buckling and their interactions. Studies on fire performance of cold-formed steel members are still fairly rare, are mostly of a numerical nature and are based on the structural behaviour of single and short elements at elevated temperatures. Hence, this research work intended to study the behaviour of cold-formed galvanized steel beams under fire conditions, basing on the results of a large programme of experimental tests. Four-point bending tests on cold-formed steel C-, lipped I-, R- and 2 R-section beams were performed, both under fire conditions, under flexural loading conditions and under simply supported boundary conditions (<b>roller</b> and <b>pinned</b> supports) with different restraining conditions, including no restraints, partial axial restraint to the thermal elongation of the beam (15 kN/mm) and partial rotational restraint at the beam supports (150 kN. m/rad). In other words, it was investigated the influence of the cross-sections, the axial restraining to the thermal elongation of the beam and the rotational stiffness of the beam supports. These beams, commonly used in CFS buildings, had a span of 3000 mm and were made of one or more cold-formed steel profiles (channel, U, and lipped channel, C, profiles), which were 2. 5 mm thick, 43 mm wide and 250 mm tall for C sections and 255 mm for the U sections. On the other hand, as reference, four-point bending tests on the same type of beams at room temperature and under simply supported boundary conditions were also carried out to assess their ultimate bending strength and to compare with the failure modes. A numerical study was still performed by the finite element program ABAQUS. So a great number of numerical simulations aimed to carry out a parametric study outside the bounds of the original experimental tests, in other words, to find out the effect of thickness (from 1. 5 mm to 3. 5 mm) and height (from 200 mm to 300 mm) of the beam cross-sections, of the beam spans (from 2000 mm to 5000 mm) and of other values of axial (from zero to infinite) and rotational stiffness (from zero to 1200 kN. m/rad) of the surrounding structure to the beam. Finally, the results of the experimental tests and the numerical simulations were the basis of an analytical study for the development of simplified calculation equations for fire design of cold-formed steel beams. The main conclusions of this research study were that the cold-formed steel beams commonly used in this kind of buildings may have a quite low fire resistance (less than 30 minutes), but high critical temperatures (higher than 350 ºC - limitation enforced by Eurocode 3, Part 1. 2) in most of the cases. On the other hand, the critical temperature may drop significantly (30 % in some cases) with the axial restraint to thermal elongation of the beam. This decreasing is however minimized when the rotational restraint at beam supports is relevant comparing with rotational stiffness of the beam...|$|R
