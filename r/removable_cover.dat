60|$|My boy had {{his secret}} longing to be a dandy, {{and once he}} was so taken with a little silk hat at the hat-store that he gave his father no peace till he got it for him. But {{the very first time}} he wore it the boys made fun of it, and that was enough. After that he wore it several times with {{streaming}} tears; and then he was allowed to lay it aside, and compromise on an unstylish cap of velvet, which he had despised before. I do not know why a velvet cap was despised, but it was; a cap with a tassel was babyish. The most desired kind of cap was a flat one of blue broadcloth, with a patent-leather peak, and a <b>removable</b> <b>cover</b> of oil-cloth, silk if you were rich, cotton if you were poor; when you had pulled the top of such a cap over on one side, you were dressed for conquest, especially if you wore your hair long. My boy had such a cap, with a silk oil-cloth cover, but his splendor was marred by his short hair.|$|E
