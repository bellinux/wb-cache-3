5|$|Labrador Retrievers {{have proven}} {{to have a high}} success rate at {{becoming}} guide dogs. A study was recently done on how well four different breeds (Labrador <b>Retriever,</b> Golden <b>Retriever,</b> Labrador Retriever/Golden <b>Retriever</b> Mix, and German Shepherds) trained to become guide dogs. In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and Labrador Retriever/Golden <b>Retriever</b> Mix had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} shown that out of all dog breeds, it is the Labrador <b>Retriever</b> that is most likely to be obese. In a 2016 {{published}} study it was shown that out of 310 Labradors, most were missing all or parts of the POMC gene. This gene plays a part in appetite regulation as well as indication of the amount of one's stored fat. The study concluded that the absence of that gene {{had a significant impact on}} Labrador weight and appetite. The POMC gene mutation is present in only one other breed – the Flat-coated <b>Retriever.</b>|$|E
50|$|The German Shepherd {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used breeds in a wide variety of scent-work roles. These include search and rescue, cadaver searching, {{narcotics}} detection, explosives detection, accelerant detection and mine detection dog, among others. They are suited for these lines of work because of their keen sense of smell and their ability to work regardless of distractions.At one time the German Shepherd was the breed chosen almost exclusively to be used as a guide dog for the visually impaired. When formal guide dog training began in Switzerland in the 1920s under the leadership of Dorothy Eustis, all of the dogs trained were German Shepherd females. An experiment in temperament testing of a group of Labrador <b>Retrievers</b> and German Shepherds showed that the <b>Retrievers</b> scored higher on average in emotional stability and ability to recover promptly from frightening situations, cooperative behavior and friendliness; while the German Shepherds were superior in aggression and defensive behavior. These results suggested that Labrador <b>Retrievers</b> were more suited to guide dog work while German Shepherds were more suited to police work.Currently, Labradors and Golden <b>Retrievers</b> are more widely used for this work, although there are still German Shepherds being trained. In 2013, about 15% of the dogs trained by Guide Dogs of America are German Shepherds, while the remainder are Labrador <b>Retrievers</b> and Golden <b>Retrievers.</b> The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the United Kingdom states that crosses between Golden <b>Retrievers</b> and Labrador <b>Retrievers</b> make the best guide dogs, although they also train some German Shepherds, as well as some other breeds. Guide Dogs for the Blind in the United States trains only Labrador <b>Retrievers,</b> Golden <b>Retrievers</b> and crosses between these breeds. Guide Dogs Queensland in Australia also trains only Labrador <b>Retrievers</b> and Golden <b>Retrievers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{registered}} breeds with the KCI include: Labrador <b>Retrievers,</b> Golden <b>Retrievers,</b> German Shepherd Dogs, Dachshunds, Dalmatians, Doberman Pinschers and Pugs.|$|R
25|$|As well, many newer dog breeds can {{be traced}} back to a common {{foundational}} breed making them difficult to separate genetically. For example, Labrador <b>Retrievers,</b> Flat-coated <b>Retrievers,</b> Chesapeake Bay <b>Retrievers,</b> and Newfoundland Dogs share the ancestry of the St. John's water dog – a now extinct naturally occurring dog breed from the island of Newfoundland.|$|R
5|$|Out of all dog breeds {{it is the}} Labrador <b>Retriever</b> that is {{most likely}} to obese. This obesity has been {{attributed}} to a specific gene mutation. See the Obesity sub section below.|$|E
5|$|The Labrador <b>Retriever,</b> also Labrador, {{is a type}} of retriever-gun dog. The Labrador is one of {{the most}} popular breeds of dog in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.|$|E
5|$|The breed is used {{in water}} rescue/lifesaving. It {{continues}} in that role today, along with the Leonberger, Newfoundland and Golden <b>Retriever</b> dogs; they are used at the Italian School of Canine Lifeguard.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, the UK breed survey {{reported}} an average lifespan for the Labrador <b>Retriever</b> of 12 years and 3 months, with some {{living up to}} 19 years of age. Labrador pups generally are not brought to the home before they are 8 weeks old.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} United Kingdom and the United States, there are well over {{twice as many}} Labradors {{registered}} as the next most popular breed. If the comparison is limited to dog breeds of a similar size, then there are around 3–5 times as many Labradors registered in both countries as the next most popular breeds, the German Shepherd Dog and Golden <b>Retriever.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, Stonehenge {{recommended}} {{a cross between}} a Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a <b>retriever.</b> He found the crossbreed to be a good worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare.|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that breed differences of Border Collies and Labrador <b>Retrievers</b> would {{be reflected in}} the temporospatial characteristics of the walk and trot. Twenty healthy Border Collies and 20 healthy Labrador <b>Retrievers</b> made three passes across a pressure sensing walkway system that recorded quantitative temporospatial information at a walk and a trot. The following variables were measured for each dog: velocity, total pressure index percentage (TPI%), ratio of weight borne on the thoracic vs. pelvic limbs (T/P TPI%), stance time percentage (ST%), and thoracic limb stride length (TSrL). The mean T/P TPI% for Border Collies at a walk and at a trot were significantly lower than for Labrador <b>Retrievers</b> (p = 0. 0007 and p = 0. 0003). Border Collies had a significantly lower ST% than Labrador <b>Retrievers</b> for the thoracic limbs and pelvic limbs at a walk (p = 0. 0058 and 0. 0003) and the trot (p = 0. 0280 and 0. 0448). There was no relationship between ST% and TSrL in Border Collies and an inverse correlation between ST% and TSrL in Labrador <b>Retrievers</b> (p = 0. 0002). Key quantitative gait differences were identified in Border Collies and Labrador <b>Retrievers,</b> which could potentially provide each breed with an advantage for their working function...|$|R

5|$|It is {{more popular}} in American cities in 2008, ranking joint tenth (with American Bulldog) in Detroit and Orlando, ninth in Los Angeles, a joint seventh in Seattle (again, with the American Bulldog), but third in Honolulu, only bested by the Labrador <b>Retriever</b> and the German Shepherd Dog.|$|E
5|$|Its use {{in hunting}} was varied, and the breed was useful both {{on land and}} in the water. In particular, it became {{successful}} in America and towards {{the beginning of the}} 20th century were popular in the area around Boston. They were described by the Spaniel Club of America as being as good in the water as the Chesapeake Bay <b>Retriever.</b>|$|E
5|$|Outside North America and Western Europe, the Labrador arrived later. For example, the Russian <b>Retriever</b> Club {{traces the}} arrival of Labradors to the late 1960s, as {{household}} pets of diplomats {{and others in the}} foreign ministry. The establishment of the breed in the Commonwealth of Independent States (former USSR) was initially hindered by the relatively small numbers of Labradors and great distances involved, leading to difficulty establishing breedings and bloodlines; {{at the start of the}} 1980s, home-born dogs were still regularly supplemented by further imports from overseas. Difficulties such as these initially led to Labradors being tacitly cross-bred to other types of <b>retriever.</b> In the 1990s, improved access to overseas shows and bloodlines is said to have helped this situation become regularised.|$|E

5|$|Pre-dating the Irish Water Spaniel {{and thought}} to have been {{referred}} to by Shakespeare in Macbeth, it is believed to have genetically influenced several modern breeds of dog, including the American Water Spaniel, Curly Coated <b>Retriever</b> and the modern variety of Field Spaniel. It is unknown if the breed was involved {{in the creation of the}} Irish Water Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Type I is more {{widespread}} in Doberman Pinscher, but is as {{common in the}} Shetland Sheepdog as the Scottish Terrier. The condition appears in most breeds to some extent, but other breeds with an increased risk include the Golden <b>Retriever,</b> German Shepherd Dog, Basset Hound and Manchester Terrier.|$|E
5|$|According to the Columbia Animal Hospital the {{frequency}} of affected animals is dogs, humans, pigs, horses, cattle, chickens, and turkeys, and in dogs the most commonly affected breeds include the German Shepherd, Golden and Labrador <b>Retriever,</b> Rottweiler, Great Dane, Bernese Mountain Dog, and Saint Bernard. Although any joint may be affected, those commonly affected by OCD in the dog are: shoulder (often bilaterally), elbow, knee and tarsus.|$|E
25|$|Laryngeal {{paralysis}} is unilateral or bilateral paralysis of the larynx. In dogs {{it can be}} congenital, seen in the Bouvier des Flandres, Bull Terrier, Dalmatian, Rottweiler and Huskies, or an acquired, idiopathic disease, seen {{in older}} Labrador <b>Retrievers,</b> Golden <b>Retrievers,</b> St. Bernards, and Irish Setters. Signs include change in voice and difficulty breathing.|$|R
50|$|Silicate (SiO2) stones form in acidic to neutral urine. They {{are usually}} jackstone in appearance.
