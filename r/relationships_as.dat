5|$|If {{there is}} a halo effect {{spreading}} to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners. DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship <b>relationships</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E
5|$|Research done by McCarthy and Taylor (1999), {{found that}} {{children}} with abusive childhood experiences {{were more likely to}} develop ambivalent attachments. The study also {{found that children}} with ambivalent attachments were more likely to experience difficulties in maintaining intimate <b>relationships</b> <b>as</b> adults.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{knowledge}} of plant anatomy, morphology and life cycles {{led to the}} realisation {{that there were more}} natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. Adanson (1763), de Jussieu (1789), and Candolle (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The Candollean system reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the later classification by Bentham and Hooker, which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary <b>relationships</b> <b>as</b> distinct from mere morphological similarity.|$|E

5|$|Statistics on lynchings {{began to}} be {{collected}} in 1882. Since that time, more than 500 African Americans {{have been killed by}} extrajudicial violence in Mississippi alone, and more than 3,000 across the South. Most of the incidents took place between 1876 and 1930; though far less common by the mid-1950s, these racially motivated murders still occurred. Throughout the South, whites publicly prohibited interracial <b>relationships</b> <b>as</b> a means to maintain white supremacy. Even the suggestion of sexual contact between black men and white women could carry severe penalties for black men. A resurgence of the enforcement of such Jim Crow mores was evident following World War II, when African-American veterans started pressing for equal rights in the South.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships and}} heredity {{of a group}} of organisms is called its phylogeny. Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine <b>relationships.</b> <b>As</b> an example, species of Pereskia are trees or bushes with prominent leaves. They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless cactus such as an Echinocactus. However, both Pereskia and Echinocactus have spines produced from areoles (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.|$|E
40|$|In this project, I used {{an object}} {{relations}} model {{to examine the}} benefits of the relationship between athletes and influential coaches. To accomplish this task, I examined the formative experiences of five men who were varsity athletes in college and focused on two questions: (1) In what ways can an athlete 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with his coach compensate for deficits resulting from parental inadequacies or empathic failures? (2) In what ways can an athlete 2 ̆ 7 s emotional bond with his coach enhance his self-esteem and facilitate his transition from adolescence to adulthood? In addition to interviewing these athletes, I interviewed the coach designated by each athlete as the most influential in his personal development. Subjects participated in a semi-structured interview, and the data from these interviews were qualitatively analyzed. Seven themes emerged from the stories told by these five athletes and their coaches: (1) the coach/player <b>relationship</b> <b>as</b> a 2 ̆ 2 good fit 2 ̆ 2 for the athlete, given his circumstances and psychological needs; (2) the coach/player <b>relationship</b> <b>as</b> reparative of the player 2 ̆ 7 s early childhood deficits; (3) the coach/player <b>relationship</b> <b>as</b> an opportunity to help the player to modulate his aggression; (4) the coach/player <b>relationship</b> <b>as</b> a facilitation of the player 2 ̆ 7 s experience of separation-individuation; (5) the coach/player <b>relationship</b> <b>as</b> a medium for identification with an important adult male role model; (6) the coach/player <b>relationship</b> <b>as</b> a means to enhance the player 2 ̆ 7 s achievement; and (7) the coach/player <b>relationship</b> <b>as</b> a context in which limits are set on the player 2 ̆ 7 s behavior. From these ten interviews, a template emerges in which the coach/player relationship {{can be seen as a}} therapeutic construct in which caring and strong role models can have lasting effects on the lives, values, and successes of young men. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{publication}} of Alfred Wegener's (1880–1930) theory of continental drift 1912 gave additional impetus to comparative physiology {{and the study}} of biogeography while ecology in the 1930s contributed the important ideas of plant community, succession, community change, and energy flows. From 1940 to 1950 ecology matured to become an independent discipline as Eugene Odum (1913–2002) formulated many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, emphasising relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy <b>relationships)</b> <b>as</b> key factors in the field. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) from 1914 to 1940 produced accounts of the geography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.|$|E
5|$|The series {{focuses on}} a high school show choir, {{also known as a}} glee club, in the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio. Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) takes over the glee club after the former teacher Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) is fired for {{inappropriate}} contact with a male student. With a rag-tag group of misfit teenagers, Will attempts to restore the glee club to its former glory while tending to his developing feelings for his co-worker, guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), as well as defending the glee club's existence from the conniving cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch). A major focus of the series is the students in the glee club: their <b>relationships</b> <b>as</b> couples, their love of singing and desire for popularity coming into conflict due to their membership in the low-status club, and the many vicissitudes of life in high school and as a teenager.|$|E
