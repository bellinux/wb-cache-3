It is, therefore, the aim of this study to obtain more information regarding the functioning of this type of family structure. The major part of this study consists of a theoretical literature survey of the functioning of the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> measured against the healthy and optimal functioning of the traditional nuclear family. The following aspects of healthy functioning in the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> were reviewed: cohesion, communication, commitment, adaptation, establishment of boundaries, the power structure, the extent of autonomy, acceptance of separation and loss, the perception of reality, and affect.

Risk factors can complicate the relationshlp between stepmothers and adolescent stepdaughters and deviate from the given criteria in this study. Extensive literature survey has been done concerning the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family,</b> relationshlps, stepmothers, adolescent stepdaughters. and biological fathers. Research shows that the stepmother-stepdaughter relationshlp is the most complicated relationshlp within the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> and adolescent stepdaughters experience more problems adapting than stepsons. Statistics reveal that the divorce rate and therefore the number of reconstituted families {{is still on the}} increase. Literature survey shows that overwhelmingly poor relationshlps are found within the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family.</b> Added to the risk factors that have been identified during research, professional people were also consulted in identifying the risk factors that could complicate the relationship between stepmothers and adolescent stepdaughters as experienced in practice. After establishing the risk factors, measuring instruments have been emperically applied to determine if the mentioned risk factors in reconstituted families can be identified. The measuring instruments include five standardised and one unstandardised questionnaires. The EPI, 16 -PF and HSPQ were used to determine the characteristics in the three parties involved. The Parentchild- communication questionnaire and the Persoonlike vraelys vir hoi!rskoolleerlinge were utilised to identifY various risk factors. The unstandardised RF-Agtergrondvraelys provides background information and highlights risk factors other measuring instruments do not identifY. Arising from information gained on a spesific <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> through measuring instmments, the risk factors can be carried over onto the Samevattende evalueringsblad vir risikofaktore. The biggest problems seem to be discipline and divided loyalty. The structure and conditions of each <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> are unique; therefore the risk factors will differ in families. Even similar risk factors can be experienced differently by each member or other families. The uniqueness and complexity surrounding the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> is emphasised by this. The identified risk factors can be used in various fields of study that involve reconstituted families. This study is helpful in court where custody placement of minors is broached.

The aim of {{this study}} is to explore and {{describe}} children’s experiences of the repositioning of their psychological birth order in a <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family.</b> The {{aim of this}} study is also to contribute to a better understanding of this phenomenon to aid the parents of these children as well as professionals working with such families. The systems theory was used as the meta-theory of this study. Gestalt field theory formed the connection between the systems theory and Adlerian theory, to portray the interaction between the individual and the different subsystems of which they are part, and formed the lens through which the study was done. Adlerian theory was used to explain the subsystems function in the micro system, with the focus on children’s experiences of the repositioning of their birth order in a <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family.</b> A qualitative research method with Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used as research design. Eight children took part in this study. The researcher used semi-structured interviews to explore their experiences of the repositioning of their psychological birth order and the data was analysed thematically. The researcher had a discussion with the participants’ parents to determine the children’s psychological birth order and to obtain background information regarding the original and reconstituted families. The findings indicated that children’s experiences in relation to their parents and siblings had the most profound effect on how they experienced the repositioning of their psychological birth order in a <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family.</b> It seemed that participants preferred their parents treating them congruent to their psychological birth order within the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> and they experienced incongruent treatment to their psychological birth order, as negative. Participants enjoyed being favoured by their parents. If the sibling who caused the repositioning was favoured, or his or her parents unfairly blamed the relevant participant, it contributed to tension in the sibling and child-parent relationships. Participants seemed to associate less time spent with parents as well as less attention from parents with step- and half-siblings in the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family.</b> Participants expressed less responsibility in the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> as a favourable aspect and more responsibilities in the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> as a unfavourable aspect of being repositioned. In the participants’ experiences, which related to their siblings, the children seemed to defend their psychological positions in their renegotiation for new positions and roles in the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> often resulting in power struggles and sibling rivalry. Age and gender differences played a role in this process. When participants were ineffective in their negotiation of a new position within the new sibling subsystem, feelings of isolation were reported. Participants experienced frustration when they were unsuccessful in their negotiations regarding former roles associated with their psychological birth order in the new family system. Participants expressed companionship with a step- or half-sibling of the same gender as a favourable experience in their repositioning. The time elapsed since the reconstitution of the family, seemed to play an important role in how children experienced the repositioning of their psychological birth order. Master...|$|E

The family's experienced burden was chosen as a mediator in this relationship. It was expected that adoptive- and foster <b>families,</b> <b>reconstituted</b> <b>families,</b> one-parent families and big families would experience a higher risk of child abuse, with the family’s burden as a mediator in this relationship.

40|$|From an {{educational}} psychology perspective, family life – as a child’s primary educational situation – is changing drastically as divorces increase worldwide. Various challenges to relationships accompany {{the restructuring of}} family systems after divorce. When remarriage occurs, children’s shared membership of two family microsystems and the resultant complexity of the mesosystem cause the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> situation to come to differ radically {{from that of a}} nuclear family. The {{purpose of this article is}} to extend Bronfenbrenner’s bio-ecological model in order to construct a deeper understanding of the relationship challenges in the context of the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family,</b> specifically noting the importance of effective parenting at mesosystemic level. Data from two separate qualitative studies was interpreted, based on Bronfenbrenner’s bio-ecological model, to form an integrated understanding of the complexity and influence of the mesosystem. The findings indicate that sound proximal interactive processes in the primary and secondary family microsystems depend on an effective mesosystem, and hence, on at least a functionally co-operative relationship between the biological parents after a divorce. Since the biological parents primarily control the effectiveness of the mesosystem, Bronfenbrenner’s extended bio-ecological model can be fruitfully applied in all professions dealing with the contextual relationship challenges of reconstituted families.

The subjects were 62 stepmothers: 28 with live-in stepchildren and 34 with visiting stepchildren. Fourteen null hypotheses were used to test the relationships between the independent variables of stepmother's age, religious preference, educational level, prior marital status, and membership in <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> support group; of stepchildren's age, sex, number, and locale of residence; and of reconstituted family's economic level, presence of children born into the present marriage, length of present marriage, and frequency of visitation to the dependent variable of stepmother's perceived adjustment in stepmother-stepchild relationship. Significant relationships were found between the independent variables of locale of residence of stepchildren, number of stepsons, and presence of children born into <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> and the dependent variable of adjustment.

40|$|Organized {{sport is}} one way that youth {{participate}} in physical activity. There are disparities in organized sport participation by family-related factors. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether non-traditional family structure and physical custody arrangements are associated with organized sport participation in youth, and if so whether this relationship is mediated by socioeconomic status. Data were from the 2009 - 10 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey, a nationally representative cross-section of Canadian youth in grades 6 - 10 (N = 21, 201). Information on family structure was derived from three survey items that asked participants the number of adults they lived with, their relationship to these adults, and if applicable, how often they visited another parent outside their home. Participants were asked whether or not they were currently involved in an organized sport. Logistic regression was used to compare the odds of organized sport participation according to family structure. Bootstrap-based mediation analysis was used to assess mediation by perceived family wealth. The results indicated that by comparison to traditional families, boys and girls from <b>reconstituted</b> <b>families</b> with irregular visitation of a second parent, <b>reconstituted</b> <b>families</b> with regular visitation of a second parent, single-parent families with irregular visitation of a second parent, and single-parent families with regular visitation of a second parent were less likely to participate in organized sport than those from traditional families, with odds ratios ranging from 0. 48 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 38 - 0. 61) to 0. 78 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 56 - 1. 08). The relationship between family structure and organized sport was significantly mediated by perceived family wealth, although the magnitude of the mediation was modest (ie, < 20 % change in effect estimate). In conclusion, youth living in both single-parent and <b>reconstituted</b> <b>families</b> experienced significant disparities in organized sport participation that was partially mediated by perceived family wealth...|$|R

We use recent Australian data from a nationally representative birth cohort study to examine the associations between family structure and children’s socio-emotional and behavioural outcomes. We contribute to the literature in two ways: by testing whether previously established relationships in the US and the UK apply in Australia, and by deploying an innovative life course methodological approach that pays attention to the accumulation, patterning and timing of exposures to different family types during childhood. As in other countries, children in Australia who spend time in one-parent or <b>reconstituted</b> <b>families</b> experience more socio-emotional and behavioural problems than other children.

40|$|Children {{living in}} reconstituted and lone parent {{families}} are {{at greater risk}} of poorer socio-emotional wellbeing than those in couple families. A life course approach can help us to understand the dynamics of family structure and how they influence child wellbeing, through consideration of sensitive and critical periods, accumulation, and trajectories of stability or change. We do this using data on 10, 357 children from the UK Millennium Cohort Study from infancy to middle childhood. Family structure (natural couple, lone parent, <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family)</b> was measured at 9 months, 3, 5 and 7 years. We used a structured life course approach to examine how family structure might influence socio-emotional wellbeing throughout childhood. We also considered the role of early-life selection, and cumulative poverty (number of sweeps spent in income poverty). We found no evidence of sensitive or critical periods for exposure to certain family types. A measure capturing trajectories of family structure stability or change was as predictive of socio-emotional wellbeing at age 7 as a saturated measure representing all permutations of family structure over time. Compared to children living in a natural couple family throughout, all other groups were more likely to experience poor socio-emotional wellbeing, although children who were living in a natural couple family which transitioned to a lone parent family had a lower prevalence ratio (PR 1. 80 [95 % confidence interval: 1. 54, 2. 10]) than the other trajectory types, such as lone parent family throughout (PR= 2. 77 [2. 34, 3. 29]), or a lone parent family which transitioned to a <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> (2. 66 [1. 99, 3. 56]). Number of sweeps spent in a lone parent or <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> was also as predictive of poor socio-emotional wellbeing as the saturated model, with the elevated risk increasing incrementally with every sweep spent in either of these family types (PR= 1. 86 [1. 52, 2. 26]) for 1 sweep, rising to 2. 87 [2. 46, 3. 56] for 4). The association between both family structure measures and socio-emotional wellbeing were, in most cases, substantially attenuated after adjustment for early-life selection factors (such as maternal social class and separation of the mother’s parents in childhood) and cumulative poverty throughout childhood.

The literature review confirmed that the relationship between former marriage partners plays an important part in fathers’ ongoing relationship with their non-resident child/ren. Findings: • The interaction in the mesosystem between the primary and secondary micro family systems of the two parents with and without custody influences the way in which the biological fathers endeavour to establish/maintain a relationship with their non-resident child/ren. Within this unique mesosystem various obstacles and potential traps exist that could prevent fathers from giving form to their educational relationship with their non-resident child/ren. • By identifying and mobilising assets and strengths the focus could shift from fathers’ feelings of frustration and powerlessness to feelings of empowerment and self-determination that could promote optimal relations.

Thirty-one (31) women and twenty-seven (27) men participated in this study. The subjects were asked open-ended questions about their perceptions of factors important to stepfamily success. Grounded theory procedures and techniques were used to analyze the data. ^ The results indicated that six factors were important to stepfamily success: (1) co-parenting between the former spouses and between the currently married couple in the stepfamily; (2) balancing the conjugal dyad with the parent-child dyadic relationships within the stepfamily; (3) emotional healing of individuals in the binuclear family; (4) appropriate communication between all members of the stepfamily; (5) spending time together as a family and allowing time to develop as a family unit; and (6) commitment to the stepfamily and to the stepfamily marriage. ^ In addition, custodial stepmothers were found to be more protective of the couple relationship than other adult members in the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family,</b> noncustodial biological fathers desired more co-parenting within the binuclear family, and individuals involved in stepfamily social support groups believed that these groups were important to stepfamily success.

40|$|True Blood [2008 - 2014] stages a post-Katrina {{deliberately}} fantasized {{and violent}} world. Relationships between species, whose representation thus displaces the endemic confrontation between races, genders and <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> members in America, are tense and dysfunctional. To capture their extreme violence, the showrunner uses {{the conventions of}} the horror genre. Vampire, werewolf movie codes and motifs are very often recycled in various episodes of the series to problematize current problems in American society such as the women's liberation movement, {{the gay and lesbian}} rights, the civil rights movement etc. All of them provide starkly original variations on the central notions of trouble and evil. The show addresses some the following key issues: which aesthetic, formal and ideological strategies are adopted to represent the different layers of reality? What kind of connection does the series establish between reality and fiction? Or else, which function(s) does the serial format serve when it tackles specific social, political, economic or societal aspects of reality at a specific time and place...|$|E
40|$|Every year {{thousands}} of core families disintegrate through divorce, {{and in the}} ensuing restructuring of the family system the child has to cope with various development challenges, such as divided membership of two micro family systems and complexities that result at the mesosystemic level. Achieving positive development outcomes {{in the presence of}} challenging living circumstances entails complex interactive processes. The aim {{of the study was to}} understand the concomitant, reciprocal and/or responsive dynamics of middle adolescents' use of their inherent resilience potential in their movement back and forth between their two <b>reconstituted</b> <b>family</b> systems after the parents' divorce. The study was grounded in the qualitative interpretivist paradigm, and used a multiple case study as research design and a narrative format for description. A purposive sample of four white Afrikaans-speaking middle adolescents participated in the research. Findings revealed that middle adolescents of divorced parents utilise their resilience potential in a systemic manner, which requires a solid base provided by the meso system. Hence the utilisation of resilience relies at the very minimum on a functional relationship of cooperation between the biological parents...|$|E
40|$|Population {{trends in}} recent years have {{prompted}} most European countries to introduce or expand family support policies. The decline in fertility since the 1970 s has led to a substantial decrease in births whose effects may be potentially detrimental over the long term. The number of children per family is often below the desired number reported in surveys. Family support is intended to close the gap between desired and actual fertility by lowering the barriers to having children. The increase in divorce and separation, and the growing numbers of <b>reconstituted</b> <b>families,</b> of chil-dren born outside marriage and of “lone ” parents have also prompted countries to increase support for fami-lies, particularly those on low incomes. At the same time, governments have sought to encourage women’s workforce participation by ensuring that these policie...|$|R
40|$|Family {{reconstitution}} {{has provided}} {{knowledge about the}} reproductive performance of mates from La Cabrera (northwest Spain). The analysis of 2293 <b>reconstituted</b> <b>families</b> (7872 births corresponding to parities 2 to 10) was restricted to the period 1880 to 1929. The proportion of infant deaths (younger than 1 year) was calculated regarding the preceding birth interval and the death or survival of the previous sibling. Considering as dependent variables the neo and the postneonatal mortality, a logistic regression was obtained. From the present analysis it is concluded that in La Cabrera 45 % of couples have the most effective reproduction with birth intervals of 24 to 36 months. Risk factors regarding neonatals {{were found to be}} intervals shorter than 17 months, the death of the preceding sibling and male sexuality. Neither maternal age nor the accumulated number of previous sibling deaths were significant risk factors...|$|R
40|$|Families are {{changing}} Families {{have changed over}} the past thirty years. This chapter {{provides an overview of}} the changes in family formation, household structure, work-life balance, and child well-being. Fertility rates have been persistently low in many OECD countries leading to smaller families. With marriage rates down and divorce rates up, there are an increasing number of children growing up in sole-parent or <b>reconstituted</b> <b>families.</b> Sole-parent families are of particular concern due to the high incidence of poverty among such households. Poverty risks are highest in jobless families and lowest amongst dual-earner families. Important gains in female educational attainment and investment in more family-friendly policies have contributed to a rise in female and maternal employment, but long-standing differences in gender outcomes in the labour market still persist. The increased labour market participation of mothers has had only a limited effect on the relative child poverty rate as households without children have made even larger income gains. Child well-being indicators have moved in different directions: average family incomes have risen but child poverty rates are also up. More youngsters are now in employment or education than before, while evidence on health outcomes is mixed. Overall, are families doing better? Some undoubtedly are, but many others face serious constraints when trying to reconcile work and family aspirations...|$|R
