A week later, Tsonga made a semifinal appearance at the Open Sud de France in Montpellier, but was beaten by Gaël Monfils for the first time.|$|E
60|$|But {{there is}} no end to the fallacies and confusions of Mr. Fergusson's arrangement. It is a perfect {{entanglement}} of gun-cotton, and explodes into vacuity wherever one holds a light to it. I shall leave him to do so with the rest of it for himself, and should perhaps have left it to his own handling altogether, but for the intemperateness of the spirit with which he has spoken on a subject perhaps of all others demanding gentleness and caution. No man could more earnestly have desired the changes lately introduced into the system of the University of Oxford than I did myself: no man can be more deeply sensible than I of grievous failures in the practical working even of the present system: but I believe that these failures may be almost without exception traced to one source, the want of evangelical, and the excess of rubrical religion among the tutors; together with such <b>rustinesses</b> and stiffnesses as necessarily attend the continual operation of any intellectual machine. The fault is, at any rate, far less in the system than in the imperfection of its administration; and had it been otherwise, the terms in which Mr. Fergusson speaks of it are hardly decorous in one who can but be imperfectly acquainted with its working. They are sufficiently answered by the structure of the essay in which they occur; for if the high powers of mind which its author possesses had been subjected to the discipline of the schools, he could not have wasted his time on the development of a system which their simplest formulæ of logic would have shown him to be untenable.|$|R

Michael was taken off stage thoroughly throttled by one of the stage-hands, and the curtain arose on the full set--full, save for the one empty chair. The boys in the audience first realized the connection between the empty chair and the previous uproar, and began clamouring for the absent dog. The audience took up the cry, the dogs barked more excitedly, and five minutes of hilarity delayed the turn which, when at last started, was marked by <b>rustiness</b> and erraticness {{on the part of the}} dogs and by great peevishness on the part of Wilton Davis.|$|E
60|$|A certain <b>rustiness</b> in Mr Venus, {{which never}} became so {{lubricated}} {{by the oil}} of Mr Wegg but that he turned under the screw in a creaking and stiff manner, was very noticeable at about this period. While assisting at the literary evenings, he even went so far, on two or three occasions, as to correct Mr Wegg when he grossly mispronounced a word, or made nonsense of a passage; insomuch that Mr Wegg took to surveying his course in the day, and to making arrangements for getting round rocks at night instead of running straight upon them. Of the slightest anatomical reference he became particularly shy, and, if he saw a bone ahead, would go any distance {{out of his way}} rather than mention it by name.|$|E
6000|$|On Saturday we {{took the}} rail for Coventry, about a half-hour's travel distant. I had been there before, {{more than two years}} ago. [...] . No doubt I {{described}} it on my first visit; and it is not remarkable enough to be worth two descriptions,--a large town of crooked and irregular streets and lanes, not looking nearly so ancient as it is, because of new brick and stuccoed fronts which have been plastered over its antiquity; although still there are interspersed the peaked gables of old-fashioned, timber-built houses; or an archway of worn stone, which, if you pass through it, shows like an avenue from the present to the past; for just {{in the rear of the}} new-fangled aspect lurks the old arrangement of court-yards, and <b>rustiness,</b> and grimness, that would not be suspected from the exterior.|$|E
60|$|Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked {{somewhere out}} of the heart of {{gorgeous}} hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all the <b>rustiness</b> of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset last left it last. For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale's talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering whose {{it was to be}} at last, and whether he would ever live to spend it.|$|E
60|$|With a shyness {{that was}} almost awe, Nares and I descended the companion. The stair turned upon itself and landed us just forward of a thwart-ship {{bulkhead}} that cut the poop in two. The fore part formed a kind of miscellaneous store-room, with a double-bunked division for the cook (as Nares supposed) and second mate. The after part contained, in the midst, the main cabin, running {{in a kind of}} bow into the curvature of the stern; on the port side, a pantry opening forward and a stateroom for the mate; and on the starboard, the captain's berth and water-closet. Into these we did but glance, the main cabin holding us. It was dark, for the sea-birds had obscured the skylight with their droppings; it smelt rank and fusty: and it was beset with a loud swarm of flies that beat continually in our faces. Supposing them close attendants upon man and his broken meat, I marvelled how they had found their way to Midway Reef; it was sure at least some vessel must have brought them, and that long ago, for they had multiplied exceedingly. Part of the floor was strewn with a confusion of clothes, books, nautical instruments, odds and ends of finery, and such trash as might be expected from the turning out of several seamen's chests, upon a sudden emergency and after a long cruise. It was strange in that dim cabin, quivering with the near thunder of the breakers and pierced with the screaming of the fowls, to turn over so many things that other men had coveted, and prized, and worn on their warm bodies--frayed old underclothing, pyjamas of strange design, duck suits in every stage of <b>rustiness,</b> oil-skins, pilot coats, embroidered shirts, jackets of Ponjee silk--clothes for the night watch at sea or the day ashore in the hotel verandah: and mingled among these, books, cigars, bottles of scent, fancy pipes, quantities of tobacco, many keys, a rusty pistol, and a sprinkling of cheap curiosities--Benares brass, Chinese jars and pictures, and bottles of odd shells in cotton, each designed, no doubt, for somebody at home--perhaps in Hull, of which Trent had been a native and his ship a citizen.|$|E
6000|$|This {{had brought}} us to my hotel door, {{somewhat}} to my relief, I confess, for I had begun to feel unequal to the society of a genius of this heroic strain. I left him, however, not without expressing a friendly hope that we should meet again. The next morning my curiosity had not abated; I was anxious to see him by common daylight. I counted upon meeting him {{in one of the}} many pictorial haunts of Florence, and I was gratified without delay. I found him {{in the course of the}} morning in the Tribune of the Uffizi--that little treasure-chamber of world-famous things. He had turned his back on the Venus de' Medici, and with his arms resting on the rail-mug which protects the pictures, and his head buried in his hands, he was lost in the contemplation of that superb triptych of Andrea Mantegna--a work which has neither the material splendour nor the commanding force of some of its neighbours, but which, glowing there with the loveliness of patient labour, suits possibly a more constant need of the soul. I looked at the picture for some time over his shoulder; at last, with a heavy sigh, he turned away and our eyes met. As he recognised me a deep blush rose to his face; he fancied, perhaps, that he had made a fool of himself overnight. But I offered him my hand with a friendliness which assured him I was not a scoffer. I knew him by his ardent chevelure; otherwise he was much altered. His midnight mood was over, and he looked as haggard as an actor by daylight. He was far older than I had supposed, and he had less bravery of costume and gesture. He seemed the quiet, poor, patient artist he had proclaimed himself, and the fact that he had never sold a picture was more obvious than glorious. His velvet coat was threadbare, and his short slouched hat, of an antique pattern, revealed a <b>rustiness</b> which marked it an [...] "original," [...] and not one of the picturesque reproductions which brethren of his craft affect. His eye was mild and heavy, and his expression singularly gentle and acquiescent; the more so for a certain pallid leanness of visage, which I hardly knew whether to refer to the consuming fire of genius or to a meagre diet. A very little talk, however, cleared his brow and brought back his eloquence.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have already}} hinted {{that it is}} not our purpose to trace down the history of the Pyncheon family, in its {{unbroken}} connection with the House of the Seven Gables; nor to show, as in a magic picture, how the <b>rustiness</b> and infirmity of age gathered over the venerable house itself. As regards its interior life, a large, dim looking-glass used to hang in one of the rooms, and was fabled to contain within its depths all the shapes that had ever been reflected there,--the old Colonel himself, and his many descendants, some in the garb of antique babyhood, and others in the bloom of feminine beauty or manly prime, or saddened with the wrinkles of frosty age. Had we the secret of that mirror, we would gladly sit down before it, and transfer its revelations to our page. But there was a story, for which it is difficult to conceive any foundation, that the posterity of Matthew Maule had some connection with the mystery of the looking-glass, and that, by what {{appears to have been a}} sort of mesmeric process, they could make its inner region all alive with the departed Pyncheons; not as they had shown themselves to the world, nor in their better and happier hours, but as doing over again some deed of sin, or in the crisis of life's bitterest sorrow. The popular imagination, indeed, long kept itself busy with the affair of the old Puritan Pyncheon and the wizard Maule; the curse which the latter flung from his scaffold was remembered, with the very important addition, that it had become a part of the Pyncheon inheritance. If one of the family did but gurgle in his throat, a bystander would be likely enough to whisper, between jest and earnest, [...] "He has Maule's blood to drink!" [...] The sudden death of a Pyncheon, about a hundred years ago, with circumstances very similar to what have been related of the Colonel's exit, was held as giving additional probability to the received opinion on this topic. It was considered, moreover, an ugly and ominous circumstance, that Colonel Pyncheon's picture--in obedience, it was said, to a provision of his will--remained affixed to the wall of the room in which he died. Those stern, immitigable features seemed to symbolize an evil influence, and so darkly to mingle the shadow of their presence with the sunshine of the passing hour, that no good thoughts or purposes could ever spring up and blossom there. To the thoughtful mind there will be no tinge of superstition in what we figuratively express, by affirming that the ghost of a dead progenitor--perhaps as a portion of his own punishment--is often doomed to become the Evil Genius of his family.|$|E
60|$|Such was the house, the household, and the {{business}} Mr Verloc left behind {{him on his way}} westward at the hour of half-past ten in the morning. It was unusually early for him; his whole person exhaled the charm of almost dewy freshness; he wore his blue cloth overcoat unbuttoned; his boots were shiny; his cheeks, freshly shaven, had a sort of gloss; and even his heavy-lidded eyes, refreshed by a night of peaceful slumber, sent out glances of comparative alertness. Through the park railings these glances beheld men and women riding in the Row, couples cantering past harmoniously, others advancing sedately at a walk, loitering groups of three or four, solitary horsemen looking unsociable, and solitary women followed at a long distance by a groom with a cockade to his hat and a leather belt over his tight-fitting coat. Carriages went bowling by, mostly two-horse broughams, with here and there a victoria with the skin of some wild beast inside and a woman’s face and hat emerging above the folded hood. And a peculiarly London sun—against which nothing could be said except that it looked bloodshot—glorified all this by its stare. It hung at a moderate elevation above Hyde Park Corner with an air of punctual and benign vigilance. The very pavement under Mr Verloc’s feet had an old-gold tinge in that diffused light, in which neither wall, nor tree, nor beast, nor man cast a shadow. Mr Verloc was going westward through a town without shadows in an atmosphere of powdered old gold. There were red, coppery gleams on the roofs of houses, on the corners of walls, on the panels of carriages, on the very coats of the horses, and on the broad back of Mr Verloc’s overcoat, where they produced a dull effect of <b>rustiness.</b> But Mr Verloc was not in the least conscious of having got rusty. He surveyed through the park railings the evidences of the town’s opulence and luxury with an approving eye. All these people had to be protected. Protection is the first necessity of opulence and luxury. They had to be protected; and their horses, carriages, houses, servants had to be protected; and the source of their wealth had to be protected {{in the heart of the}} city and the heart of the country; the whole social order favourable to their hygienic idleness had to be protected against the shallow enviousness of unhygienic labour. It had to—and Mr Verloc would have rubbed his hands with satisfaction had he not been constitutionally averse from every superfluous exertion. His idleness was not hygienic, but it suited him very well. He was in a manner devoted to it with a sort of inert fanaticism, or perhaps rather with a fanatical inertness. Born of industrious parents for a life of toil, he had embraced indolence from an impulse as profound as inexplicable and as imperious as the impulse which directs a man’s preference for one particular woman in a given thousand. He was too lazy even for a mere demagogue, for a workman orator, for a leader of labour. It was too much trouble. He required a more perfect form of ease; or it might have been that he was the victim of a philosophical unbelief in the effectiveness of every human effort. Such a form of indolence requires, implies, a certain amount of intelligence. Mr Verloc was not devoid of intelligence—and at the notion of a menaced social order he would perhaps have winked to himself if there had not been an effort to make in that sign of scepticism. His big, prominent eyes were not well adapted to winking. They were rather of the sort that closes solemnly in slumber with majestic effect.|$|E

On day two of the tournament the Ghent Gators defeated the Luxembourg Steelers to claim 3rd place and then all eyes turned to the final. The Trojans took to the field wearing their new away uniforms, a throwback to the white shirts of their early days, the two teams seemed evenly balanced in the early stages of the game but eventually the hosts began to struggle with the power running of the Trojans offence and the tenacity of the defence.

The paper {{deals with}} the use of {{sintered}} corundum in grinding of tools. It evaluates the impact of technological conditions on cutting forces during grinding, the tool wear and quality of machined surfaces, provided changes in the concentration of grains in sintered corundum grinding wheels. Sintered corundum is a type of artificial corundum, where the feedstock is aluminiummonohydrate which, after merging with Al-dispersion granules of desired size of grains and the subsequent process of acquiring the final strength and surface hardness. Under external loading of the grinding wheel grains separated by a variety of large crystalline fragments and thus produce more grain for sharp points and cutting edges. Among the advantages of the new abrasive is <b>rustiness</b> and thus lower the frequency of dressing and longer life. Of sintered corundum abrasive is designed for grinding hard and very tough materials (hardness of 48 HRc, HSS, etc.). The introduction of grinding wheels with greater porosity is considerable technological and economic benefit. Advantageous is also adding to the sintered corundum grinding wheel. This adjustment significantly improves the <b>rustiness</b> tools. It should be emphasized that the use of new grinding wheels with higher porosity and higher content sintered corundum leads to the deterioration of the arithmetic average roughness of polished surfaces.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is {{evaluation}} of occurence of rusts on the selected types of grass, their specific diagnosis and valorization of their influence on the important agricultural qualities. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a cooperation with SS Větrov. In a two-year period (in 2009 and 2010) the samples of infested plants, which were subsequently evaluated microscopically, were taken. The ascertained results were processed through the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Independent Group T-Test. In 2009 and 2010 the occurrence of stem rust on the tested types of grass was significantly higher than occurence of crown rust. From the total number of 513 tests stem rust was found in 353 cases, whereas crown rust was found only in 103 cases. In 27 samples the occurrence of both types of rusts was found and there was no occurence found {{on the rest of the}} plants. The results show that in our climatic conditions stem rust becomes the most frequent pathogen which causes <b>rustiness</b> of grass. In 2010 the results of turf experiments proved that the selection of genotype of perenne reygrass with a lower infestation by stem rust had a positive impact on health conditions and better appearance of the offspring of the selected plans. Effectivenes of selection was confirmed. Among the tested materials there were chosen very predisposed genotypes which could be useful as the infectious material in the planned greenhouse tests for the resistance against rusts. Currently, we have also been abble to recognize the genotypes which are relatively resistant against particular rusts. If their resistance is confirmed in the following period, they might be used as donors of resistance in xenogamy and as immune standards in tests. The introduced results from the first stage of cooperation are only preliminary and it will be necessary to verify them at the following stages...|$|E
