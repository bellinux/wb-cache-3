Until 2010, no research had been conducted on signed language interpreting services provided through AVL for legal purposes. Given the high stakes involved in legal proceedings mediated through interpreters, it is imperative to analyse the effectiveness of <b>remote</b> signed language <b>interpreting</b> via AVL to conduct legal proceedings. Qualitative findings are provided that give an overview of the stakeholder perspectives of the effectiveness of AVL to enable signed language interpreter-mediated legal proceedings.

The reaserch was carried out by Remote Sensing on the widest range of platforms available (current and historical aerial photographs, digital orthophotos, satellite images, digital elevation models at different resolution) and through the more refined treatment and processing of images (image enhancing, image processing), or through the use of programs dedicated to the automatic and semi-automatic recognition of anomalies.
