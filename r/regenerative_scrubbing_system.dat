40|$|CANSOLV SO 2 Scrubbing in Refinery Applications Tighter regulations, an {{increasing}} spread between {{sweet and sour}} crude prices and attractive revenue opportunities for sulfur and its byproducts have led refiners to increase their use of high sulfur fuels internally and install flue gas desulfurization systems to capture SO 2. The CANSOLV SO 2 <b>Scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> has been in use commercially since 2002 {{and a total of}} nine units are now operating worldwide. These units capture SO 2 from fluid cat cracking (FCC) unit regenerator offgas, fluid coker CO Boiler offgas, lead and copper smelter offgas, sulfur plant tail gas and sulfuric acid plant tail gas. This paper will illustrate how the CANSOLV SO 2 <b>Scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> can be used effectively in the refinery to control emissions and capture additional byproduct value from flue gas streams generated by the FCC, refinery process heaters, sulfur plants and spent acid regeneration units.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to using liquid sprays or the exhaust stream, <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems</b> can use motors to supply energy. The motor drives a rotor or paddles which, in turn, generate water droplets for gas and particle collection.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically aided {{scrubbers}} {{are generally}} not used for gas absorption. The contact time between the gas and liquid phases is very short, limiting absorption. For gas removal, several other <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems</b> provide much better removal per unit of energy consumed.|$|R
5000|$|Venturis are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used scrubber for particle collection and are capable of achieving the highest particle collection efficiency of any wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system.</b> As the inlet stream enters the throat, its velocity increases greatly, atomizing and turbulently mixing with any liquid present.|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of dry type <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> designs.

40|$|AbstractBabcock Hitachi {{has been}} {{developing}} a new amine-based scrubbing technology for capturing {{carbon dioxide in the}} flue gas of coal-fired power plants. The development program includes testing of commercial and new combinations of absorbents and additives. More than thirty kinds of amines have been evaluated and characterized by both fundamental tests in the laboratory and slipstream pilot plant tests. The pilot plant tests of the CO 2 <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> were conducted at a coal-fired power plant in co-operation with Tokyo Electric Power Company. Two thousand hours of continuous operation was achieved with more than 90 % CO 2 reduction on average during the entire operation. Energy consumption with the original absorbent blend was much less than that with typical MEA. Since then the CO 2 <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> has been further advanced to reduce the energy consumption as well as absorbent degradation drastically by improving the amine-based absorbent in a bench-scale test facility. Pilot tests at Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC), University of North Dakota, were conducted in 2010 and the test results indicated high performance of the improved amine-based absorbent, H 3 - 1. This latest advanced solvent is also scheduled to be demonstrated in a large mobile test facility at several coal-fired power plants in Europe starting 2010. In parallel, conceptual designs of the CO 2 <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> for commercial plants up to 800  MWe in size are being developed...|$|R

5000|$|An {{important}} parameter in wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems</b> is {{the rate}} of liquid flow. It is common in wet scrubber terminology to express the liquid flow {{as a function of}} the gas flow rate that is being treated.

50|$|Mechanically aided {{scrubbers}} {{have been}} used to control exhaust streams containing particulate matter. They have the advantage of being smaller than most other <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems,</b> since the fan is incorporated into the scrubber. In addition, they operate with low liquid-to-gas ratios.

50|$|Small liquid {{droplets}} {{cool the}} exhaust stream {{more quickly than}} large droplets because they evaporate more easily. Therefore, less liquid is required. However, in most <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems,</b> approximately one-and-a-half to two and- a-half times the theoretical evaporation demand is required to ensure proper cooling. Evaporation also depends on time; it does not occur instantaneously. Therefore, the quencher should be sized to allow for an adequate exhaust stream residence time. Normal residence times range from 0.15 to 0.25 seconds for gases under 540°C (1000°F) to 0.2 to 0.3 seconds for gases hotter than 540°C.|$|R
40|$|Cooperative Power`s Coal Creek Station (CCS) became fully {{operational}} in 1981. The two 550 -MW units at CCS burn North Dakota lignite. The resulting by-products are fly ash, bottom ash, and wet FGD material. Although disposal {{of the coal}} combustion by-products (CCBs) {{was included in the}} original site plant at CCS, even early on, consideration was given to utilization of the fly ash as a mineral admixture for concrete and as a partial sorbent replacement for the wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system.</b> CCS fly ash has been successfully marketed into North Dakota, Minnesota, and the surrounding region as a construction material that is environmentally benign, highly consistent, and an excellent performer in numerous construction applications. Attempts to use CCS fly ash as part of the scrubbing medium in the wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> at the site were not as successful as first hoped, primarily due to the abrasive nature of the fly ash. Currently, CCS scrubbers use lime as the scrubbing medium for SO{sub 2 } removal. CCS`s efforts to market its fly ash have been successful, so with increased awareness of the economic advantages of by-product utilization, the favorable US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory determination that CCBs are not hazardous, and the improved understanding of potential local and regional markets, Cooperative Power has taken additional steps to investigate the processing and utilization of its wet FGD material. These steps are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Process gasses were {{exhausted}} through a Lab Guard wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system.</b> The growth {{was carried out}} at atmospheric pressure. Ultra high purity Ar {{was used as a}} carrier gas. Typical carrier flow was 3000 sccm, HCl and NH 3 flows were 1 – 10 and 50 – 200 sccm, respectively. The efficiency of ammonia decomposition drops with temperature, and is rather low at the InN growth temperatures. For this reason, the growth of InN requires a relatively high flow of ammonia [6]. The growth was estimated to be at a rate of ∼ 45 nm/min and was carried out for 30 min.|$|R
50|$|Wet {{scrubbers}} capture {{relatively small}} dust particles with large liquid droplets. In most wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems,</b> droplets produced are generally larger than 50 micrometres (in the 150 to 500 micrometres range). As {{a point of}} reference, human hair ranges in diameter from 50 to 100 micrometres. The size distribution of particles to be collected is source specific.For example, particles produced by mechanical means (crushing or grinding) tend to be large (above 10 micrometres); whereas, particles produced from combustion or a chemical reaction will have {{a substantial portion of}} small (less than 5 micrometres) and submicrometre particles.|$|R

40|$|A {{continuous}} gas {{and liquid}} flow, <b>regenerative</b> <b>scrubbing</b> process for CO{sub 2 } capture was demonstrated at the bench-scale level. An aqueous ammonia-based solution captures CO{sub 2 } from simulated flue gas in an absorber and releases a nearly pure stream of CO{sub 2 } in the regenerator. After the regeneration, {{the solution of}} ammonium compounds is recycled to the absorber. The design of a continuous flow unit was based on earlier exploratory results from a semi-batch reactor, where a CO{sub 2 } and N{sub 2 } simulated flue gas mixture flowed through a well-mixed batch of ammonia-based solution. During the semi-batch tests, the solution was cycled between absorption and regeneration steps to measure the carrying capacity of the solution at various initial ammonia concentrations and temperatures. Consequentially, {{a series of tests}} were conducted on the continuous unit to observe the effect of various parameters on CO{sub 2 } removal efficiency and regenerator effectiveness within the flow system. The parameters that were studied included absorber temperature, regenerator temperature, initial NH{sub 3 } concentration, simulated flue gas flow rate, liquid solvent inventory in the flow system, and height of the packed-bed absorber. From this testing and subsequent testing, ammonia losses from both the absorption and regeneration steps were quantified, and attempts were made to maintain steady state during operations. Implications of experimental results with respect to process design are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Calcium looping {{already has}} an energy {{advantage}} over amine scrubbing, {{but the main}} problem is that amine scrubbing is the more market-ready technology. However, the accompanying infrastructure for amine scrubbing include large solvent scrubbing towers, {{the likes of which}} have never been used on an industrial scale. The accompanying infrastructure for calcium looping capture technologies are circulating fluidized beds, which have already been implemented on an industrial scale. Although the individual technologies differ in terms of current technological viability, the fact that the infrastructure needed to properly implement an amine <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> has yet to be developed keeps calcium looping competitive from a viability standpoint.|$|R
50|$|The ejector venturi {{is unique}} among {{available}} <b>scrubbing</b> <b>systems</b> since it {{can move the}} process gas {{without the aid of}} a fan or blower. The liquid spray coming from the nozzle creates a partial vacuum in the side duct of the scrubber. The partial vacuum is due to the Bernoulli effect, and is similar to water aspirators used in chemistry labs. This partial vacuum can be used to move the process gas through the venturi as well as through the facility's process system. In the case of explosive or extremely corrosive atmospheres, the elimination of a fan in the system can avoid many potential problems.|$|R
40|$|MSc (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 An {{electric}} arc furnace makes use of electrical {{energy in the form}} of an arc to heat charged material. In the ferromanganese smelting process the ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3) and manganese oxide (MnO 2) are reduced with coke. The basic reaction that takes place is described in the following equation Fe 203 + 2 Mn 02 + 7 C	 = 2 FeMn + 	 7 C 0 The high quantity of carbon monoxide (CO) produced in the process, which has a significantly high calorific value, can be used to generate energy to supplement certain areas of the process. Due to the moisture in the charged material, electrolysis takes place within the furnace, generating hydrogen (H 2) and oxygen (O 2). The high temperature allows a percentage of the carbon monoxide to combust instantly with the available oxygen, which forms carbon dioxide (CO 2). The balance of gas in the process is primarily nitrogen (N 2), which comes from the air drawn into the furnace, as it is impossible to seal the furnace off perfectly. The oxygen from the air also combusts with the carbon monoxide, however there is always a small percentage of oxygen that does not combust. The following table indicates the percentiles of the different gas compositions within the furnace Gas Composition Percentage (Typical) Percentage (Range) Carbon Monoxide 51. 0 % 50. 0 - 65. 0 % Carbon Dioxide 13. 0 % 10. 0 - 20. 0 % Nitrogen 25. 0 % 20. 0 - 28. 0 % Hydrogen 8. 30 % 7. 50 - 12. 0 % Oxygen 2. 00 % 0. 50 - 3. 50 % Methane 0. 70 % 0. 40 - 0. 80 % Table 1 : Typical gas composition percentages The power input into the furnace process to induce the reduction of the ferric- and manganese oxide, determines the rate at which the reaction takes place. The power input is most commonly measured in MVA and then multiplied by the furnace power factor, which is a function of the electrode characteristics as an inductor, to convert to MW. The rate at which off-gas is generated does not change significantly with the change in power input, however the dust load in the off-gas stream changes exponentially. Larger particulate is generated with the increase in power, as well as the total mass of dust per cubic meter of gas. The dust loading of the off-gas plays a critical role in the design of an off-gas <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system.</b> The following table indicates the increase in dust load with the increase of power input into the furnace. Power Input [MVA] Dust Emission Rate [μg/s] 30 1082. 877 40 2793. 574 50 7206. 776 60 18591. 82 70 47962. 61 Table 2 : Dust emission rate as a function of furnace power Another critical factor of the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> design is particle size distribution (PSD). The maximum emission of a plant is dictated by environmental legislation, and needs to be adhered to. The greater the dust load in the gas stream, the more efficient the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> needs to be, because small particulate, which are particles with a sub-micron aerodynamic diameter, is more difficult to remove from a gas stream. The greater the dust load per cubic meter, the greater the quantity of the sub-micron particulate, which significantly influences the design of the scrubber. The required increase in efficiency exponentially increases the power consumption of the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system,</b> which greatly increases supply costs and service requirements of the plant. The following table indicates the particle size distributions Particle Size [μm] Percentage [Typical] < 1. 00 20. 0 % 1. 00 - 5. 00 40. 0 % 5. 00 - 10. 0 20. 0 % 10. 0 - 100. 0 15. 0 % 50. 0 - 100. 0 4. 00 % 100. 0 - 500. 0 1. 00 % Table 3 : Particle size distribution at 40 MW furnace load These parameters are paramount when conducting the front-end engineering of a <b>scrubbing</b> <b>system</b> for this application.
