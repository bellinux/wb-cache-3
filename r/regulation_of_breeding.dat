Howling is considered normal for all wild dogs of Australia. Hybrids {{as well as other}} domestic dogs have been observed in tight pack structures and free-ranging domestic dogs in Southeast-Australia have been observed hunting and foraging in groups. Free-ranging dogs in Victoria were generally observed in pairs (54%) or alone (34%), with packs of three to seven dogs in 12% of the sightings. Furthermore, there are also reports of dingoes with more than average size and weight and cases where hybrids were successfully used as working and companion dogs and the Australian Cattle Dog was proven to have dingo ancestors. A generally higher aggression of hybrids could not be confirmed by owners, who worked with respectively investigated them; furthermore hitherto observations and encounters with hybrids in the wild did not reveal any evidence, that hybrids are generally more aggressive than “pure” dingoes.|$|E
40|$|The {{steroid hormone}} {{testosterone}} (T) plays {{a central role}} in the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> in males, because many physiological, morphological and behavioural traits related to reproduction are T dependent. Moreover, in many seasonally breeding vertebrates, male plasma T levels typically show a pronounced peak during the breeding season. While such population-level patterns are fairly well worked out, the sources and the implications of the large variability in individual T levels within the seasonal cycle remain surprisingly little understood. Understanding the potential sources of individual variation in T levels is important for behavioural and evolutionary ecologists, for at least two reasons. First, in ‘honest signalling ’ theory, T is hypothesized to play a critical role as the assumed factor that enforces honesty of the expression of sexually selected quality indicators. Second, T is often considered a key mediator of central life-history trade-offs, such as investment in survival versus reproduction or in mating versus parental care. Here, we discuss the patterns of within- and betweenindividual variation in male plasma T levels in free-living populations of birds. We argue that it is unclear whether this variability mainly reflects differences in underlying individual quality (intrinsic factors such as genetic or maternal effects) or in the environment (extrinsic factors including time of day, individual territorial status and past experience).

Here, we combined {{the deployment of}} GPS devices (from 2008 to 2010) and the monitoring of breeding parameters and baseline corticosterone levels (from 2007 to 2011) during the pre-laying period to investigate the proximate <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> date in an Arctic population of black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla. The timing of breeding varied considerably {{during the course of}} the study and late breeding was associated with reduced clutch size and low breeding success at the individual level. Foraging strategies differed considerably between males and females and among years. All but one of the females tracked using GPS during the pre-laying period foraged inside the fjord, whereas tracked males foraged both inside and outside the fjord, using the deep waters of the Greenland-Svalbard ridge. Trips lasted longer and were to greater distances in 2009, the year of late breeding, compared to 2008 and 2010, highlighting a food scarcity in 2009. Corticosterone levels differed among years, and were the lowest in 2010, the year of earliest breeding. Moreover, kittiwakes exhibiting higher corticosterone levels tended to undertake longer trips when foraging outside the fjord. Breeding decision and laying date were not related to corticosterone levels at the individual level, but were positively influenced by body condition, suggesting that complex proximate mechanisms may affect timing of breeding in kittiwakes...|$|E

40|$|Griffon Vultures Gyps fulvus in {{northern}} Spain were studied between 1969 and 1994. The number of breeding pairs increased from 221 in 1969 - 1975 to 1395 in 1994. The annual population growth rate decreased {{in the last}} 5 years, and this may reflect population regulation through density-dependent phenomena. Breeding success was monitored in 1994 and examined in relation to colony size, density of breeding pairs within a radius of 25 km (regional density), climate, human disturbance and food availability. We also recorded whether the year of first occupation of each nest site was before 1989 or after 1989 {{and whether or not}} the nest had a rocky shelter. The probability of successfully raising young declined as the regional density increased, which suggests that resource limitation would take place at foraging sites because the Griffon Vulture scavenges socially and no permanent feeding hierarchies are established. The other significant variable was the year of occupation of the nest; nests occupied after 1989 had a lower probability of raising a chick. The increase in the regional density of Griffon Vultures produced a decrease in the productivity at both optimal and suboptimal nest sites. This suggests that density-dependent <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> success operates through interference and that all the individuals in a colony are similarly affected. In birds of prey, prevalence of interference or habitat heterogeneity may be dependent on the social strategy of each species in space exploitation. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Timing {{is crucial}} in {{seasonal}} environments. Passerine birds typically {{use a combination of}} physiological mechanisms and environmental cues to ensure that breeding, moult and migration occur without major temporal overlap and under the most favourable conditions. However, late in the breeding season some individuals initiate additional clutches, whereas others initiate moult. Such alternative strategies are thought to reflect trade-offs between reproductive benefits and timely investment in maintenance and survival. The degree of seasonal plasticity differs between species, depending on the mechanisms that govern their annual routine. Migrants are generally under pressure to complete breeding and moult before the autumn departure and often show little plasticity. We studied seasonal plasticity of breeding and moult schedules in the European Stonechat Saxicola rubicola. This species, an obligate short-distance migrant in Central Europe, sometimes initiates late clutches after typically at least two earlier breeding attempts. Based on life-history theory and on observations in captivity, which revealed photoperiodic <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> and moult, we predicted relatively little seasonal plasticity in Stonechats. We further predicted that reproductive gains of late breeders should be offset by reduced survival. These predictions were tested on long-term field data, using Underhill-Zucchini models to estimate moult. Late breeding occurred in c. 40 % of pairs and increased their reproductive success by a third. Both sexes modified moult timing but in different ways. Late breeding females postponed moult approximately until chick independence without compensating for delay by faster moult. Males started moult on time and overlapped it with breeding, associated with markedly slowed plumage change. Sex differences in moult score increased with lay date, but due to their respective modifications, both sexes delayed moult completion. Nonetheless, we could not detect any evidence for survival costs of late breeding. Breeding and moult of European Stonechats appear relatively flexible, despite migratory schedules and photoperiodic programs for seasonal timing. Individuals can modify seasonal behaviour in late summer, presumably depending on their condition, and may profit considerably from extended breeding...|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the growth of cold-blooded stallions in pig breeding test rearing houses. The Czech Republic has set up three pig breeding test rearing houses. A total of 96 stallions were measured with 14 body measurements and they were also weighed whilst alive. Statistically significant differences were detected between breeds as well as between age groups when evaluating the intensity of growth of all measured body size and body weight. In most body sizes there were the biggest Silesian Norics horses (SN). At the age of {{two and a half years}} they stagnated growth in chest circumference, the circumference of the tibia and sternum height, even though it is stated in the Rules and <b>Regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> book that SN mature between 5 - 6 years of age. During the evaluation there were no statistically significant differences between rearing houses. Stallions from the rearing house of Proseč prevailed in growth usually at the beginning of rearing, and later stallions from the rearing house of Dvorka at the age of one and a half year grew most. Stallions in the rearing house of Humňany had the lowest WHS, WHT and CC. The smallest variances of individual body size from the three studied cold-blooded breeds were detected by the CzechMoravian Belgian horse (CMB). This breed can therefore be regarded as the most well bred. The greatest value of the index body frame, the index heights in the crisis as well as index of severity were found in the breed SN. On the other hand CMB reached the lowest values in the above-mentioned indices and also in the index of boniness. Norick horses (N) have the most massive skeleton. In the scope of the height index of the sternum there was prevailed CMB at the beginning of rearing, but at the age of year and a half they began reaching a higher value N.

40|$|Background: A {{territory}} as {{a prerequisite}} for breeding limits {{the maximum number of}} breeders in a given area, and thus lowers the proportion of breeders if population size increases. However, some territorially breeding animals can have dramatic density fluctuations and {{little is known about the}} change from density-dependent processes to density-independence <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> during a population increase or an outbreak. We suggest that territoriality, breeding suppression and its break-down can be understood with an incomplete-control model, developed for social breeders and social suppression. Results: We studied density dependence in an arvicoline species, the bank vole, known as a territorial breeder with cyclic and non-cyclic density fluctuations and periodically high densities in different parts of its range. Our long-term data base from 38 experimental populations in large enclosures in boreal grassland confirms that breeding rates are density-regulated at moderate densities, probably by social suppression of subordinate potential breeders. We conducted an experiment, were we doubled and tripled this moderate density under otherwise the same conditions and measured space use, mortality, reproduction and faecal stress hormone levels (FGM) of adult females. We found that mortality did not differ among the densities, but the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breeding</b> rate broke down: at double and triple densities all females were breeding, while at the low density the breeding rate was regulated as observed before. Spatial overlap among females increased with density, while a minimum territory size was maintained. Mean stress hormone levels were higher in double and triple densities than at moderate density. Conclusions: At low and moderate densities, breeding suppression by the dominant breeders, But above a density-threshold (similar to a competition point), the dominance of breeders could not be sustained (incomplete control). In our experiment, this point was reached after territories could not shrink any further, while the number of intruders continued to increase with increasing density. Probably suppression becomes too costly for the dominants, and increasing number of other breeders reduces the effectiveness of threats. In wild populations, crossing this threshold would allow for a rapid density increase or population outbreaks, enabling territorial species to escape density-dependency...|$|R

Our aim {{was to examine the}} suitability of bacteriologic and serologic methods routinely used in France to screen serum samples and organs for S. Gallinarum. Since bacteriologic reference techniques are designed to isolate the commonly occurring non-typhoid serovars, such as S. Typhimurium, S. Enteritidis, and others that cause outbreaks of foodborne illness, they may not be particularly suitable for detecting S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum. This hypothesis was confirmed by the inoculation of 10 -wk-old chickens and 1 -d-old chicks with various strains of S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum. The most reliable enrichment media were selenite cystine and Rappaport-Vassiliadis broths. Moreover, on the usual plating media, colonies were small, grew more slowly than the common serovars (in 48 h instead of 24 h), and had an unusual appearance. Since the rapid slide agglutination (RSA) test is based only on antigens from standard and variant strains of S. Pullorum, it may not readily detect S. Gallinarum. In our study, it detected infection in all 10 -wk-old chickens inoculated with S. Pullorum strains but did not detect any antibodies against S. Gallinarum. Therefore, S.
