50|$|Tuju {{delved into}} {{a raft of}} unjust tariff and {{non-tariff}} barriers that would stifle the growth of Africa and widen the <b>resource</b> <b>gap</b> with Europe. He particularly expressed displeasure at the recent move by some EU countries to impose stiff regulations on Kenya that were bound to stifle the country's vibrant horticulture industry. Kenya is the biggest exporter of flowers, accounting for 26 per cent of the world's market. The draconian carbon miles policy and another requirement for fumigation of Kenya's flower exports, said Tuju, were discriminatory and aimed at unfairly curtailing {{the dominance of the}} country's products. On the other hand, Tuju argued the fumigation of Kenya's flowers was calculated to reduce their shelf life and hence cheapen them at the world market. He also took issue with discriminatory sports policies such as the one imposed on the country's athletes by the United States, limiting the number of entrants in a competition.|$|E

50|$|Ricardian {{equivalence}} has crucial {{importance in}} the fiscal policy considerations of new classical macroeconomics. When assessing Ricardian equivalence {{or any of the}} new classical doctrines, one should bear in mind the conditional character of these theses. Thus the equivalence theorem should not be separated from the assumptions on which it is based. In other words, Ricardian equivalence does not mean that any countercyclical efforts will fail, but outlines the necessary conditions for that failure and, naturally, for success at the same time. Governments do not have any potential to exert countercyclical efforts if the path of government expenditures is fixed and if agents form rational expectations. If these conditions hold, cuts in taxes imply a later pressure to rise taxes, since government has to fill the <b>resource</b> <b>gap</b> in the budget which {{is the result of the}} initial tax cut. So, rational agents will put the additional income from the tax cut into savings and consumption does not rise. In this story, public operations should stand in the focus of reasoning: if these processes can be changed by the government, or, in any way, the additional income can be believed not to be withdrawn later, the initial tax cut will induce a rise in public consumption expenditures.|$|E
30|$|A dynamic fiscal model {{analysis}} shows {{that over the}} next 5  years, the likelihood that the Cambodian government will face a fiscal <b>resource</b> <b>gap</b> is estimated to be approximately 50  %. This relatively high probability {{is due to the fact}} that disaster occurrence is frequent in Cambodia, and the cumulative effect of frequent disaster events will likely stress the fiscal situation. Based on the risk layering framework (Hochrainer-Stigler and Pflug 2012; Mechler et al. 2014), it can be inferred that investment in risk reduction would be the most effective way to manage disaster risk, as a fiscal <b>resource</b> <b>gap</b> is estimated to be relatively low, following a 28 -year return period event. In addition, investment in a reserve fund as opposed to costlier alternatives such as sovereign insurance and contingent credit agreements could be an effective option for Cambodia. By investing approximately USD 100 million in a reserve fund, it is estimated that the Cambodian government can reduce the risk of a fiscal gap to approximately 30  %. Assuming the cost effectiveness of risk reduction to be 4.5 (that is, for each USD 1 spent on mitigation, USD 4.5 can be saved) (Hochrainer-Stigler 2012), the probability of a <b>resource</b> <b>gap</b> will be reduced to 35  % when USD 100 million is invested in risk reduction activities. Over the next 10  years, the probability of a <b>resource</b> <b>gap</b> is estimated at approximately 90  %, but USD 100 million invested annually in mitigation will reduce this to 36  % while the establishment of a reserve fund will reduce it to 45  %. As these examples show, risk reduction will increasingly become the most effective way to manage fiscal risk in the longer-term as more assets are built to support economic growth in Cambodia.|$|E

30|$|The {{present study}} {{highlighted}} {{some of the}} important insights regarding natural disaster risk management in Cambodia. The analysis indicated that Cambodia has a high probability of facing a fiscal <b>resource</b> <b>gap</b> in the near future, estimated at approximately 50  % over the next 5  years and 90  % over the next 10  years. Compared to its neighboring countries, Cambodia’s fiscal preparedness is limited due {{to a number of}} factors, which include a lack of experience with catastrophic disaster events in the recent past and limited priority given to disaster risk reduction investment. Cambodia is estimated to face a <b>resource</b> <b>gap</b> following a 28 -year return period event, a more immediate prospect than the neighboring countries of Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia that face similar gaps in terms of a 157 -, 109 -, and 116 -year return period events respectively (Hochrainer-Stigler et al. 2014). At the same time, dynamic analysis highlighted the effectiveness of disaster risk reduction (DRR) investment in the longer term. As more economic assets are utilized in the country to spur economic growth, risk reduction will become an increasingly effective risk management tool in the future.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Southeast Asia {{has been}} the focus of {{considerable}} investment in pandemic influenza preparedness. Given the wide variation in socio-economic conditions, health system capacity across the region is likely to impact to varying degrees on pandemic mitigation operations. We aimed to estimate and compare the <b>resource</b> <b>gaps,</b> and potential mortalities associated with those gaps, for responding to pandemic influenza within and between six territories in Asia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected health system resource data from Cambodia, Indonesia (Jakarta and Bali), Lao PDR, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. We applied a mathematical transmission model to simulate a "mild-to-moderate" pandemic influenza scenario to estimate <b>resource</b> needs, <b>gaps,</b> and attributable mortalities at province level within each territory. The results show that wide variations exist in resource capacities between and within the six territories, with substantial mortalities predicted as a result of <b>resource</b> <b>gaps</b> (referred to here as "avoidable" mortalities), particularly in poorer areas. Severe nationwide shortages of mechanical ventilators were estimated to be a major cause of avoidable mortalities in all territories except Taiwan. Other resources (oseltamivir, hospital beds and human resources) are inequitably distributed within countries. Estimates of <b>resource</b> <b>gaps</b> and avoidable mortalities were highly sensitive to model parameters defining the transmissibility and clinical severity of the pandemic scenario. However, geographic patterns observed within and across territories remained similar for the range of parameter values explored. CONCLUSIONS: The findings have important implications for where (both geographically and in terms of which resource types) investment is most needed, and the potential impact of resource mobilization for mitigating the disease burden of an influenza pandemic. Effective mobilization of resources across administrative boundaries could go some way towards minimizing avoidable deaths...|$|R

The (capital) <b>resource</b> <b>gap</b> {{is said to be the}} most common obstacle to development and growth by the small- and medium-size enterprises. In the course of the research of corporate capital structure we’ve come to the conclusion that the characteristic method of solving the (capital) <b>resource</b> <b>gap</b> is the use of external capital, internally the most dominant was bank credit and trade credit. However the biggest part of the trade credit comes not from regular operating in the market, but is the consequence of the growth of gridlock, and the slackening solvency. Our model calculations for the relationship of the weighted average cost of capital (the profit-earning capacity of the assets) and the financial leverage prove that most of the enterprises don’t give proper attention to the basic principles of financing (profit-earning capacity, safety, elasticity, liquidity). If the use of external capital sources is not in proportion to the profit-earning capacity of the enterprise, the slackening of capital efficiency reduces the self financed capacity even more, so it increases the financial and the operating leverage, worsen its negative effects. The choice of the financing strategy is conscious only at a few enterprises, so negative effects coming from the difference between the terms structures of the assets and resources appear more than the positive. forráshiány, hitelösszetétel, finanszírozási stratégia, lack of capital, share of credits, financial strategies, Agribusiness, Agricultural Finance, Financial Economics,...|$|E
