5|$|Grand Duke Vytenis' origins are {{relatively}} well-established; {{he was the}} son of Butvydas, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295. No consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give Traidenis as the ancestor, this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson Boleslaw-Yuri would have violated canon law, since the two would have been <b>related</b> <b>by</b> <b>blood,</b> and this violation would likely have been noticed by the pope.|$|E

25|$|In the field's early years, many clinicians {{defined the}} family in a narrow, {{traditional}} manner usually including parents and children.

He {{conducted}} successful military campaigns against the Hellenic inhabitants of Cilicia, which had threatened Babylonian interests.

25|$|Two {{facts about}} Ælfgifu's family {{background}} are unambiguously stated by the sources. First, her mother bore {{the name of}} Æthelgifu, a woman of very high birth (natione præcelsa). Second, she was related to her husband Eadwig, since in 958 their marriage was dissolved by Archbishop Oda on grounds that they were too closely <b>related</b> <b>by</b> <b>blood,</b> that is, within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity. Ælfgifu has been also identified with the namesake who left a will sometime between 966 and 975, which might shed further light on her origins.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{partnership}} in the District {{used to be}} open to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. One of the unusual features of the original bill establishing domestic partnerships was that it allowed partnerships to be created between people who were <b>related</b> <b>by</b> <b>blood</b> (e.g., siblings or a parent and adult child, provided both were single). All couples registered as domestic partners are entitled to the same rights as family members and spouses to visit their domestic partners in the hospital and jail and to make decisions concerning the treatment of a domestic partner's remains and estate after the partner's death.|$|E

The citizens {{appealed to the}} city council to re-establish the office of Town Marshal, abolished some years earlier. However, the council refused. Texas Rangers were dispatched, to include James Brooks, which effectively ended the violence in 1907.|$|R

25|$|Nero (Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus) was a great-great-grandson of Augustus and Livia {{through his}} mother, Agrippina the Younger. The younger Agrippina was a {{daughter}} of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, as well as Caligula's sister. Through his mother, Nero was <b>related</b> <b>by</b> <b>blood</b> to the Julian and Claudian branches of the Imperial family. However, he was born into the Domitii Ahenobarbi on his father's side. Nero became a Claudian in name {{as a result of}} Agrippina's marriage to her uncle, Claudius, who ultimately adopted her son as his own. He succeeded Claudius in AD 54, becoming the last direct descendant of Augustus to rule the Roman Empire. Within a year of Nero's suicide in AD 68, the Julio-Claudian dynasty was succeeded by the Flavian emperors following a brief civil war over the vacant Imperial throne.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Hogwarts, Snape {{became a}} Death Eater and {{informed}} Voldemort of half of an overheard prophecy, which Voldemort takes {{to refer to}} Lily and her son, Harry. Fearing for Lily's life, Snape joins the Order as a spy for Dumbledore, in exchange for what he hopes will be Dumbledore's protection of Lily. Voldemort offered Lily the chance to step aside before he killed Harry because of Snape's request to spare Lily's life, but Lily refused and Voldemort killed her. The result of her selfless act of love manifested itself two ways: when Voldemort attempted to kill Harry with the Killing Curse the spell backfired, rendering Voldemort non-corporeal. The lingering protection afforded to Harry by Lily's sacrifice rendered Voldemort unable to touch him physically. The second way in which Harry is protected by Lily's sacrifice occurs when Petunia takes Harry in. Dumbledore told Harry that he had extended Lily's protection to Privet Drive, because Lily and Petunia are <b>related</b> <b>by</b> <b>blood.</b> This protection ends when Harry comes of age at 17.|$|E

50|$|In October 1655 Mackworth {{wrote to}} Richard Ottley warning of a {{petition}} {{that had been}} lodged with Cromwell against him. The relationship between the Ottley family and the Mackworths was at least ambivalent. Although <b>related</b> <b>by</b> both <b>blood</b> and marriage, the elder Humphrey Mackworth and Sir Francis Ottley had taken radically opposed stances during the Civil War and participated closely in the sequestration of each other's estates. There {{may have been a}} continuing feud, as Mackworth seems to have been behind one or more attempts to pursue Sir Francis in the law courts under the Commonwealth.|$|R
25|$|Libyan {{concepts}} of rule {{allowed for the}} parallel existence of leaders who were <b>related</b> <b>by</b> marriage and <b>blood.</b> Shoshenq and his immediate successors used that practice to consolidate their grasp on all of Egypt. Shoshenq terminated the hereditary succession of the high priesthood of Amun. Instead he and his successors appointed men to the position, most often their own sons, a practice that lasted for a century.|$|R
25|$|Norris {{was born}} in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the son of James Sylvester Norris 1850-1914 and Eleanor Waud. James Sylvester Norris was {{involved}} in a grain trading company, Norris and Carruthers. Norris lived in Montreal where the company owned an office and a warehouse and Carruthers lived in Toronto, where it rented premises in the Board of Trade building. His grandparents were Captain James Norris 1820-1891 and Sophrinia Neelon. Norris Place in St. Catharines, Ontario is named after Captain James Norris who was a sea captain, businessman, mayor of St Catharines and MP. His great grand parents were James Norris 1793-1839 and Nancy Ann Black. They left Scotland and settled in Caledon East, Peel, Ontario, Canada with their family about the year 1834. His first cousin, one time removed was Peter Blair Norris, named after his grandfather Peter Blair, of Belfountain, Ontario. His first cousin Captain Charles H. Norris settled in Maitland, Nova Scotia and by 1852 owned Norris & Sanderson, a large shipbuilder on Nova Scotia's Shubenacadie River and one of the world's largest sailing fleets. James Norris was not directly <b>related</b> <b>by</b> <b>blood</b> to Dr. John Knox Blair, 1873–1950, a Member of Parliament for the Wellington North Riding, Ontario. He was an accomplished athlete in his youth, playing hockey, squash and tennis. He was a defenceman at McGill University, won the 1897 intermediate championship with Montreal Hockey Club, and later played in 3 games in 1898 for the Montreal Hockey Club senior team.|$|E
25|$|Mustafa Kemal's name is {{associated}} with four women: Eleni Karinte, Fikriye Hanım, Dimitrina Kovacheva and Latife Uşaklıgil. Little is known of Mustafa Kemal's relationship with Eleni, who {{fell in love with}} him while he was a student in Bitola, Macedonia (Manastır in Turkish) but the relationship inspired a play by the Macedonian writer Dejan Dukovski, later filmed by Aleksandar Popovski. Fikriye was a nominal cousin of Mustafa Kemal, though not <b>related</b> <b>by</b> <b>blood</b> (his stepfather Ragıp Bey's sister's daughter). Fikriye grew passionately attached to Mustafa Kemal; the full extent of his feelings for her is unclear but it is certain that they became very close after Fikriye divorced her Egyptian husband and returned to Istanbul. During the War of Independence, she lived with him in Çankaya, Ankara as his personal assistant. However, after the Turkish army entered İzmir in 1922, Mustafa Kemal met Latife while staying at the house of her father, the shipping magnate Muammer Uşakizade (later Uşaklı). Latife fell in love with Mustafa Kemal; again the extent to which this was reciprocated is unknown, but he was certainly impressed by Latife's intellect: she was a graduate of the Sorbonne and was studying English in London when the war broke out. On 29 January 1923, they were married. Latife was jealous of Fikriye and demanded that she leave the house in Çankaya; Fikriye was devastated and immediately left in a carriage. According to official accounts, she shot herself with a pistol Mustafa Kemal had given her as a present; however, it was rumoured that she was murdered. The triangle of Mustafa Kemal, Fikriye and Latife became the subject of a manuscript by his close friend, Salih Bozok which remained unpublished until 2005. Latife was briefly and literally the face of the new Turkish woman, appearing in public in Western clothing with her husband. However, their marriage was not happy; after frequent arguments they were divorced on 5 August 1925.|$|E

5000|$|In {{sociology}} of the family, {{this idea is}} referred to as chosen kin, fictive kin or voluntary kin. Sociologists define the concept as a form of extended family members who are not <b>related</b> <b>by</b> either <b>blood</b> or marriage. The bonds allowing for chosen kinship may include religious rituals, close friendship ties, or other essential reciprocal social or economic relationships. Examples of chosen kin include godparents, informally adopted children, and close family friends. The idea of fictive kin has been used to analyze aging, foreign fighters, [...] immigrant communities, and minorities in modern societies. Some researchers state that peers have the potential to create fictive kin networks.|$|R

5|$|There {{was also}} a {{secondary}} motive for men, especially young males, for learning the agung: the ability to interact with young, unmarried women. Both Maranao and Maguindanao cultures traditionally adhere to Islamic customs which prohibit dating or causal conversation between the opposite sexes (unless married to or <b>related</b> to <b>by</b> <b>blood)</b> and therefore performances such as kulintang music provided the opportunity for such a connection. Among the Maguindanao, the rhythmic modes of duyog and sinulog a kamamatuan allowed agung players to serenade the young, unmarried women on the kulintang. Tidto, the other rhythmic mode, {{could also be used}} but players rarely use this for serenading since the kulintang player is usually an older woman.|$|R
