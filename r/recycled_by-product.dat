40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of this work was to study Cr(VI) sorption/desorption on two by-products from the wood industry: pine sawdust and oak wood ash. The retention/release experiments were carried out using standard batch-type trials. In the sorption-phase experiments, pine sawdust showed 23 % sorption when a concentration of 100 mg Cr(VI) L− 1 was added, whereas sorption on oak wood ash was 17 %. In the desorption-phase, chromium release was clearly higher from pine sawdust than from oak wood ash (98 % and 66 %, respectively). Sorption curves were well fitted to the Freundlich and Lineal models. In view of the results, both materials can be considered of very limited value to remove Cr from polluted soil and water, which can be of relevance regarding its appropriate use as biosorbents and <b>recycled</b> <b>by-products...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} focused on the use of coal bottom ash from Tefereyre (Niger) power plant coal-fuelled, as a fine {{aggregate}} in cementitious mortar. Various volume fractions of natural sand (0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 %) were replaced by the same volume of fine aggregates of coal bottom ash. In order to determine the effect of coal bottom ash incorporation on the composites obtained, fresh and dry density water absorption, porosity, thermal conductivity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, gas permeability and microstructure analyses were investigated. The results show that incorporating coal bottom ash in mortar causes an increase in the apparent porosity and that leads to an increase of the water absorption and the apparent permeability of the samples at 28  days curing age. The densification of bottom ash mortar during the curing age contributed to significantly reduce the increase in the porosity and the apparent permeability. This densification was confirmed by SEM analysis and ultrasonic velocity measurement. However, the use of coal bottom ash reduces the specific weight and the thermal conductivity of cementitious materials.

Tasmanian pyrethrum production is among the most innovative, high-tech agricultural industries in the world. With an output that nearly quadrupled since 1996, Botanical Resources Australia (BRA) now supplies more then 30 % of the global pyrethrum markets. Developments such as vacuum precision direct seeding allowed dramatic expansion in the total area planted to pyrethrum which is now ~ 3, 000 ha. Using new generation cutter rower the flower is dried, pelletised and extracted. Initially the hexane extracted dark, treacly crude pyrethrum extract was exported to be refined overseas. BRA designed, built and commissioned a refinery in Tasmania during 1999. This environmental friendly process involving carbon dioxide was cutting edge technology. BRA is currently commissioning a new large-scale multi-purpose hexane extraction plant.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} environmental permits of landfills {{with respect to the}} appropriateness of risk assessments focusing on contaminant migration, structures capable to protect the environment, waste and leachate management and existing environmental impacts of landfills. According to the requirements, a risk assessment is always required to demonstrate compliance with environmental protection requirements if the environmental permit decision deviates from the set requirements. However, there is a reason to doubt that all relevant risk factors are identified in current risk assessment practices in order to protect people end environment. In this dissertation, risk factors were recognized in 12 randomly selected landfills. Based on this analysis, a structural risk assessment method was created. The method was verified with two case examples. Several development needs were found in the risk assessments of the environmental permit decisions. The risk analysis equations used in the decisions did not adequately take into account all the determining factors like waste prospects, total risk quantification or human delineated factors. Instead of focusing on crucial factors, the landfill environmental protection capability is simply expressed via technical factors like hydraulic conductivity. In this thesis, it could be shown, that using adequate risk assessment approaches the most essential environmental impacts can be taken into account by consideration of contaminant transport mechanisms, leachate effects, and artificial landfill structures. The developed structural risk analysing (SRA) method shows, that landfills structures could be designed in a more cost-efficient way taking advantage of <b>recycled</b> or <b>by-products.</b> Additionally, the research results demonstrate that the environmental protection requirements of landfills should be updated to correspond to the capability to protect the environment instead of the current simplified requirements related to advective transport only...|$|R

As {{all in the}} metallurgical processes the production of stainless steel is producing by-products as slags. The different kinds of processes produce about 300 000 tonnes slags annually, almost the whole amount {{of this has been}} deposited after the metal separation up to recent days. The project to utilize the steel slag started during 2001 with the aim {{to increase the amount of}} <b>recycled</b> <b>by-products</b> and to develop new slag-products. By-products are produced from the different process part as Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF 1, EAF 2), Argon Oxygen Decarburization converters (AOD 1, AOD 2), ladle stations and Chromium Converter (CRC). The chemical composition of slags from a process has a slight variation, but between the different processes the variations in analyses are greater. The chemical composition of the slags is dependent to the characters of the slag, as volume stability by basicity of the material. The aim of this work was to investigate the quality control of chromium containing steel slags during cooling into solid phase. The product should be an aggregate with sufficient hardness and low leaching behaviors. The investigation started when the slag was poured into a slag pot at melting shop, any addition of stabilizers or other chemical components has not been done. The aim was to investigate the dependence of different cooling methods to spinel forming. The physical properties of the product of the tests were tested by Nordic ball mill test (prEN 1097 - 9). The chemical analyses were: total analyses (XRF), and leaching test (Shaking test prEN 12457 - 3). A powder X-ray diffraction meter analyses (XRD) was used to estimate the mineralogy of the samples. The solid aggregate samples were studied with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Simulations with respective chemical analysis of the slags were done by the data program FactSage. The slags, included in this work, were mainly EAF 2 and CRC slags because of less variation in chemical analysis of these slags. These slags contain chromium, a minor part of chromium is not bound in spinels, which is a reason for leaching. During the first tests, which were carried out by water-cooling, no significant decreasing of leaching of chromium was observed. When pouring out the slag as a thin bed the leaching of chromium was lower compared to the massive bed of the same slag part. Lower leaching of chromium from the massive material from the thin bed can be caused by the smaller active surface of material. Reference test with semi-quenched slag were made and they showed low leaching values compared with the slags from normally pouring practices. Semi-quenched slag is porous and cannot be analyzed in SEM and was hence milled as powder and analyzed in XRD. The mineralogy of semi-quenched slag is varying in some degree from the mineralogy of normally poured slag. The semi-quenched slag, pumice, is partly amorphous which can be the reason for lower leaching values of chromium. Granulation tests have been made earlier with all of the three types of slag, but all of these showed higher leaching values than those of pumice. During granulation material may come in contact with air and become oxidized and chromium oxides leach more than other compounds of chromium. The lowest leaching values of slag can be attained by semi-quenching of material but the product is not an aggregate and cannot be used in all of the civil engineering applications. Aggregates can be produced by cooling on the slabs, but the slag bed should be maximum 10 cm thick, so that the gases can flow out before solidification of material. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|Due to the 15 - 20 year {{life span}} of roofing {{shingles}}, 1. 5 million tonnes of asphalt roofing shingles are being demolished and replaced annually in Canada from both residential and commercial facilities. These roofing shingles are manufactured from very high quality materials which are considered a valuable <b>by-product.</b> <b>Recycled</b> Asphalt Shingles (RAS), a product containing approximately 30 % asphalt cement by mass, is a valuable additive to Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavements and a potential savings for the construction industry. Recycling of demolished asphalt shingles is a significant new step forward in abating the need to put the waste into landfills. This re-use creates a great opportunity in reducing materials being dumped at landfills while providing an additive to HMA mixtures for paving. Therefore, this leads to economic, environmental, and social benefits for all the stakeholders and road users such as reduced need for landfill space, conservation of virgin materials and environment, and financial saving. The research involved evaluating the use of demolished shingles in six typical Ontario Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) mixtures; HL 3 (1. 5 % RAS, 13. 5 % RAP), binder layer mixes SP 19 (6 % RAS, and 3 % RAS, 25 % RAP), surface layer mixes SP 12. 5 FC 1 (3 % RAS, 17 % RAP) and SP 12. 5 FC 2 (6 % RAS and 3 % RAS, 12 % RAP). The six HMA mixes were also designed to contain Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP). This further complicated the research as both RAP and RAS were added. All mixes were designed and tested at CPATT laboratory; in addition a test section was paved at the CPATT Test Track. This research involved both laboratory and field evaluations of mixes containing RAS to develop pavement performance modeling for all six mixes using the updated Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). A life-cycle assessment of the six HMA mixes was performed to quantify the environmental impacts using the Pavement Life-Cycle Assessment Tool for Environmental and Economic Effects (PaLATE) and rigorous economic costs/benefits were assessed using Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA). Calibrations of models for Ontario conditions were completed. Test slabs were also constructed to simulate climatic changes by running freeze-thaw cycles based on weather data {{over the past ten}} years. Three field test sections located in the Town of Markham and one at the CPATT Test Track were monitored and assessed under as part of the research. Regular pavement condition assessments were carried out on all the test sections by performing non-destructive tests using a Portable Falling Weight Deflectometer (PFWD) and distress survey in accordance with the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) guidelines. The CPATT Test Track was evaluated with both the PFWD and surface distresses, whereas only distress surveys were performed on the three residential streets in the Town of Markham. The evaluations demonstrated that the pavements were in good conditions throughout the monitoring period of the research (four years for the three residential streets in the Town of Markham and two years for the CPATT Test Track). The structural analysis using the MEPDG indicated that Mix 3 : SP 19 3 % RAS and 25 % RAP had the best performance followed by Mix 2 : SP 19 6 % RAS when considering all factors in the Life-Cycle Assessment. Mix 3 exhibited maximum savings on environmental emissions, energy and water usage, best adoptability to climatic change and skid resistance properties with minimal life cycle costs. The pavement performance and life-cycle assessment modeling demonstrated encouraging results for the use of RAS in HMA pavements from which guidelines were developed for its use. It {{is important to note that}} careful mix design should be carried out when RAS is added to HMA especially when RAP is also used. This includes measuring of all key properties especially at low and high temperatures. In short, RAS can be a valuable additive in both surface and binder layers of HMA pavements. It provides an environmentally friendly and cost-effective innovation for the Ontario paving industry and can be considered for usage elsewhere with appropriate engineering...|$|R
