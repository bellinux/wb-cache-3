The magnitude-7.7 cluster is 56,000 light-years from Earth. Only 1° away is NGC 5053, a {{globular cluster}} with a sparser nucleus of stars. Its total luminosity is the equivalent of about 16,000 suns, one of the lowest luminosities of any globular cluster. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. NGC 4147 is a somewhat dimmer globular cluster, with a much-smaller apparent size.|$|E
5|$|The battle system {{takes place}} on a 3D {{battlefield}} in real-time, instead of the turn-based system of the campaign. Battles {{are similar to those}} in , where two armies from opposing factions engage in combat until one side is defeated or withdraws. Warfare in Medieval: Total War occurs when the player or the artificial intelligence moves their armies into a province held by a hostile faction. The player is then presented with the option of fighting the battle on the battle map, or allowing the computer to automatically <b>resolve</b> <b>it.</b> Alongside the campaign battles, players have the option of both historical and custom battles, where the player controls what climate, units and terrain will be present on the battlefield.|$|E

25|$|The tonic key of {{the song}} is F major (although, since McCartney tuned his guitar down a whole step, he was playing the chords {{as if it were}} in G), where the song begins before veering off into the key of D minor. It is this {{frequent}} use of the minor, and the ii-V7 chord progression (Em and A7 chords in this case) leading into it, that gives the song its melancholy aura. The A7 chord {{is an example of a}} secondary dominant, specifically a V/vi chord. The G7 chord in the bridge is another secondary dominant, in this case a V/V chord, but rather than <b>resolve</b> <b>it</b> to the expected chord, as with the A7 to Dm in the verse, McCartney instead follows it with the IV chord, a B. This motion creates a descending chromatic line of C–B–B–A to accompany the title lyric.|$|E

25|$|In 2011 China was {{the largest}} {{producer}} of steel in the world producing 45% of the world's steel, 683milliontons, an increase of 9% from 2010. 6 of 10 of largest steel producers {{in the world are}} in China. Profits are low despite continued high demand due to high debt and overproduction of high end products produced with the equipment financed by the high debt. The central government is aware of this problem but there is no easy way to <b>resolve</b> <b>it</b> as local governments strongly support local steel production. Meanwhile, each firm aggressively increases production. Iron ore production kept pace with steel production in the early 1990s but was soon outpaced by imported iron ore and other metals in the early 2000s. Steel production, an estimated 140milliontons in 2000 increased to 419milliontons in 2006. Much of the country's steel output comes from a large number of small-scale producing centers, one of the largest being Anshan in Liaoning.|$|E

500|$|Velociraptor is {{a member}} of the group Eudromaeosauria, a derived {{sub-group}} of the larger family Dromaeosauridae. It is often placed within its own [...] "subfamily", Velociraptorinae. In phylogenetic taxonomy, Velociraptorinae is usually defined as [...] "all dromaeosaurs more closely related to Velociraptor than to Dromaeosaurus." [...] However, dromaeosaurid classification is highly variable. Originally, the subfamily Velociraptorinae was erected solely to contain Velociraptor. Other analyses have often included other genera, usually Deinonychus and Saurornitholestes, and more recently Tsaagan. However, several studies published during the 2010s, including expanded versions of the analyses that found support for Velociraptorinae, have failed to <b>resolve</b> <b>it</b> as a distinct group, but rather have suggested it is a paraphyletic grade which gave rise to the Dromaeosaurinae.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the judges}} {{explained}} that the court had jurisdiction because the case brought up a legal issue, that of statutory interpretation (whether the 1911 Act {{could be used to}} enact the 1949 Act), rather than being examination of parliamentary proceedings. Lord Bingham noted that the bill was not enacted by both Houses of Parliament, as it was in Pickin, and that [...] "the appellants have raised a question of law which cannot, as such, be resolved by Parliament ... {{so it seems to me}} necessary that the courts should <b>resolve</b> <b>it,</b> and that to do so involves no breach of constitutional propriety". Lord Nicholls distinguished Jackson from Pickin as a case examining the correct interpretation of the 1911 Act, an evaluation for the courts rather than Parliament; Lord Hope concurred, noting that there was no absolute prohibition on courts evaluating the validity of Acts of Parliament; and Lord Carswell agreed that the case raised [...] "a question of law which falls within the scope of courts of law carrying out their regular function". All nine judges accepted that the court had jurisdiction to consider whether the 1949 Act was valid.|$|E
