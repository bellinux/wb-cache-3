2500|$|Police at Shannon Airport {{said that}} they had {{received}} political instruction not to approach, search or otherwise interfere with US aircraft suspected of being involved in extraordinary rendition flights. Irish Justice Minister Dermot Ahern sought permission from the US for <b>random</b> <b>inspection</b> of US flights, to provide political [...] "cover" [...] to him in case rendition flights were revealed to have used Shannon; he believed at least three flights had done so.|$|E
5000|$|... 3. The final <b>random</b> <b>inspection</b> (also called “pre-{{shipment}} inspection”) {{is by far}} {{the most}} common type of QC check. It takes place once 100% of shipment quantity is finished and at least 80% is packed, so it can be a real <b>random</b> <b>inspection</b> (this is not exactly the case if quality is checked earlier) and suppliers cannot play games.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{inspector}} Kevin Klapper, an ex-football addict, {{has come}} for a <b>random</b> <b>inspection.</b> He disapproves {{of the game and}} writes a scathing report. He too succumbs to the lure of the game and stalls, ignoring his job to help coach the team.|$|E
50|$|There is no ticket {{inspections}} when boarding DPB vehicles (except regional {{lines in}} some situations). Instead, <b>random</b> <b>inspections</b> by plain clothes ticket inspectors are being conducted.|$|R
50|$|Conditions at Hawara were {{relaxed in}} July 2009. The {{checkpoint}} was opened to allow pedestrians to cross freely without being searched. Palestinian vehicles have sometimes faced only <b>random</b> <b>inspections.</b>|$|R

50|$|PSI {{ensures that}} {{production}} complies with specifications of the buyer and/or {{the terms of}} a purchase order or letter of credit. A final <b>random</b> <b>inspection</b> (FRI), checks finished products when at least 80% of an order has been produced and export-packed. Samples are selected at random, according to standards and procedures.|$|E
50|$|In November 2011, the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust {{announced}} plans to replace outdated equipment and rebuild FGH's maternity ward {{at a cost of}} £5 million. A <b>random</b> <b>inspection</b> in September 2012 by the CQC found that recommended changes had been made and found quality and safety standards being met.|$|E
5000|$|Backscatter X-ray {{machines}} use {{low dose}} penetrating radiation for detecting suspicious metallic and non-metallic objects hidden under clothing or in shoes {{and in the}} cavities of the human body. X-ray machines are used in some Russian airports (e.g. Moscow Domodedovo Airport, Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport, Irkutsk International Airport [...] ) for <b>random</b> <b>inspection</b> of passengers.|$|E
50|$|Luas {{tickets are}} purple in colour {{and credit card}} sized. They bear a {{magnetic}} stripe on the back although this is not used on Luas. Uniquely among Dublin's public transport, tickets are not checked upon boarding trams and an honour system, combined with <b>random</b> <b>inspections,</b> is used.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Random</b> <b>inspections</b> offer {{opportunities}} for bribes, corruption and informal payments. The authorities lose {{out because they}} cannot systematically monitor the structural soundness of their buildings and businesses lose time and money every time they have to stop construction to pay off an inspector. Experiences {{from around the world}} show that statutory time limits are more effective when coupled with [...] "silence is consent" [...] rules. The latter keep bureaucrats on track and lessen the chances of lost or neglected permit applications and endless delay tactics. Countries with a system of risk-based inspections have fewer inspections than countries with <b>random</b> <b>inspections.</b> Countries with risk-based inspections do not compromise the general safety of their citizens. Instead of visiting the site at whim, inspectors stick to a schedule based on the completion of each construction phase.|$|R
50|$|The German {{government}} {{passed legislation}} in June 2009 to improve handgun security {{with an electronic}} nationwide weapons registry, increased age limitations for large-calibre weapons, and unannounced, <b>random</b> <b>inspections</b> in gun-owner homes to ensure requirements for locked gun storage were met. Obligatory biometric security systems should be introduced once technically feasible.|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} {{established}} in May 1990 as a unified fare system with a coordinated local train network. Local train lines were prefixed with the letter S (S-Bahn). S-Lines 1 through 43 (with some lines missing) and now form part of the S-Bahn Network. A proof-of-payment fare system is in force on all S-Bahn trains. Fare gates are not used, but those caught without a valid ticket during a <b>random</b> <b>inspection</b> face a minimum fine of CHF 100.|$|E
5000|$|Component {{qualification}} (CQ) - is {{a relatively}} new term developed in 2005. This term refers to the manufacturing of auxiliary components to ensure that they are manufactured to the correct design criteria. This could include packaging components such as folding cartons, shipping cases, labels or even phase change material. All of these components must have some type of <b>random</b> <b>inspection</b> to ensure that the third party manufacturer's process is consistently producing components that are used in the world of GMP at drug or biologic manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Once {{a vehicle}} is registered, it {{generally}} will {{not need to}} be inspected again if it remains with the same owner. However, the Australian Capital Territory has a <b>random</b> <b>inspection</b> scheme, vehicles can be spot checked whether occupied or not. If faults are discovered, a defect notice can be issued in which case the owner will be required to have repairs made, and obtain a full inspection from a licensed examiner with 14 days to clear the notice. If egregious safety violations are found, the vehicle's registration can be suspended on the spot and the operator will need to have the vehicle towed.|$|E
50|$|Each {{industrial}} unit {{is to be}} inspected {{once every}} nine months; as established in advance. Occasional <b>random</b> <b>inspections</b> may occur with written permission of the department manager. Maximum facilitation encompasses an effective system beyond a single window anchor. Self-certification and automatic renewal will be encouraged along with an online E-Help line system.|$|R
50|$|Gun {{ownership}} in Taiwan is prohibited to ordinary citizens. There are currently more than 5,000 legal private handgun owners, of which 1,000 {{are used for}} self-defense and 4,000 are used for hunting by the Taiwanese aborigines. Gun owners in Taiwan are required to receive regular inspections every two years as well as <b>random</b> <b>inspections</b> by the police.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, PetMed Express settled charges {{with the}} Florida Pharmacy Board for selling drugs {{that did not}} have prescriptions, false advertising, poor record keeping, and not {{labelling}} drugs correctly; PetMed Express paid a fine of around $30,000, agreed to send its pharmacist for further education, agreed to <b>random</b> <b>inspections,</b> and agreed to provide regular reports to the board.|$|R
50|$|An {{investigation}} by ABC News into the training methods of Tennessee Walking Horses revealed that many horses had been tortured and beaten {{to make them}} produce their signature high-stepping gait. In a video shot by the Humane Society of the United States, high-profile trainer Jackie McConnell is seen beating horses, using electric cattle prods, and soring their hooves with caustic chemicals. Additionally, a <b>random</b> <b>inspection</b> by the Department of Agriculture at the 2011 annual championship found {{that all of the}} 52 horses inspected had a foreign substance applied to their front hooves, either to cause pain or hide it.|$|E
5000|$|Ep5 - Environmental Ambience Stable, Wish You Were Here: Luna {{is feeling}} bored, and Andy proposes going on holiday. To do this the group {{need to get}} travel permits from 80H, but he is {{only too happy to}} provide them, since the Assistant Galactic Coordinator is visiting the sector for a <b>random</b> <b>inspection</b> and he is {{concerned}} he would find their habiviron [...] "inefficient". They arrange their plans, but 80H learns that the Coordinator will be visiting earlier than expected, and therefore gives the group permits for the earlier time, leaving their bookings unusable and no time to make earlier ones. Gramps suggests that they could go camping instead, and Brat produces a model VW Beetle which can be converted into a full-size car for them to drive in. Unfortunately, they then find that Jazzmin has no travel permit, and 80H cannot get her one, since technically she is not permitted to be in the habiviron at all. 40D agrees to substitute one of hers, and the group prepares to leave, only to find that car does not work; Brat had no idea that cars needed petrol, which is no longer available. As a last resort, the group decide to camp inside the Habiviron. The Assistant Coordinator arrives in the habiviron as part of his <b>random</b> <b>inspection,</b> and 80H nearly passes out when he sees what's going on, but in fact he's happy to join in.|$|E

500|$|GO Trains use a [...] "Proof-of-payment honour system" [...] {{on which}} {{passengers}} {{may be subject}} to <b>random</b> <b>inspections</b> to prove that they have paid their fares. This system is designed to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The integrity of this system is protected by Metrolinx's By-law No. 2, which by reference to the Provincial Offences Act imposes a $100 fine for fare evasion.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{pangolins}} {{have been}} protected by legislation since the 1970s and 1980s, people still choose to hunt these endangered animals. After <b>random</b> <b>inspections</b> on May 28, 2014, at the Kwai Chung cargo port in Hong Kong, officials detained scales from nearly 8,000 pangolins. Just two weeks later, Hong Kong officials seized a second shipment that contained scales from about 5,000 pangolins.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} interplay between two {{important}} policies that impact the environmental performance in a production setting: inspections performed by a regulator and noncompliance disclosure by a manufacturing …rm. Expecting that a penalty will be levied once an inspection discovers noncompliance, the …rm decides whether it should disclose a random occurrence of noncompliance. Anticipating this, the regulator determines the inspection frequency and the penalty amount that minimize environmental and social costs, performing either periodic <b>inspections</b> or <b>random</b> <b>inspections.</b> We study this problem by developing a novel analytical framework that combines the features from reliability theory and law enforcement economics. We …nd that, contrary to a common belief, a threat of increased penalty does not always lessen the need for costly inspections; there are situations where the regulator should invest in frequent inspections to complement the penalty. We also …nd that, counter to intuition, surprising the …rm with <b>random</b> <b>inspections</b> is not always preferred to inspecting the …rm periodically according to a set schedule...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2012, the Federal Communications Commission {{issued a}} notice of {{apparent}} liability and proposed a $17,000 fine against Nassau Broadcasting II, stating WPLY [...] "willfully and repeatedly violated" [...] FCC regulations. The investigation {{leading to the}} notice stemmed from a <b>random</b> <b>inspection</b> conducted at the WPLY facilities in March 2010, during which {{it was discovered that}} the station had been transmitting from only one of its four antennas at greatly reduced power (250 watts) without receiving authorization and had been doing so since Nassau purchased the station in 2000. FCC regulations require that stations unable to operate at full power must apply for a temporary authorization to operate at reduced power, which WPLY did only after the 2010 inspection, claiming that the station's antenna array was [...] "severely deteriorated" [...] and in need of extensive repairs.|$|E

5000|$|In 2001, The New York Post ran {{an article}} accusing {{the group of}} child labor violations; and later {{attributed}} itself as having prompted the Investigation. The Twelve Tribes responded with a press conference at the [...] "Commonsense Farm" [...] where the alleged child labor had taken place. The Twelve Tribes reported that during a <b>random</b> <b>inspection</b> by Estée Lauder Companies the company discovered that several fourteen-year-olds had been found assisting their fathers in their cottage industry; this report was later confirmed by Estée Lauder who terminated their contract with Common Sense products. The Group's official statement {{at the press conference}} stated that they believed that it was a family owned business, and children {{ought to be able to}} help their parents in the business while making [...] "no apology" [...] for it. The New York State Department of Labor stated that they intended to visit all five of the Twelve Tribes' businesses. State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer asserted that apprenticeships amounted to indentured servitude and were illegal. Robert Redford's Sundance Catalog, who had contracted with Common Wealth Woodworks (another of the group's cottage industries that made furniture), also terminated their contract as a response to the allegations. The Labor Department found no violations at Common Sense Farm or Commonwealth Woodworks. They did fined two other industries two thousand dollars for a fifteen-year-old pushing a wheelbarrow and another fifteen-year-old changing a lightbulb.|$|E
2500|$|As on TriMet's MAX line, the streetcar's fare {{system is}} a proof-of-payment (or [...] "honor") system, with {{occasional}} <b>random</b> <b>inspections</b> of passengers' fares, which minimizes wait times at stops by allowing boarding to take place simultaneously through all vehicle doorways. Streetcar operators do not collect or monitor fares. Although the line {{is not part of}} the TriMet system, the city adopted TriMet's fares for the streetcar, for simplicity and convenience of transferring passengers.|$|R
