5|$|New England {{businessmen}} {{also tried}} to establish a market for ice in England during the 1840s. An abortive first attempt to export ice to England had occurred in 1822 under William Leftwich; he had imported ice from Norway, but his cargo had melted before reaching London. Fresh attempts were made by Jacob Hittinger who owned supplies at Fresh Pond, and Eric Landor, with assets at Wenham Lake, in 1842 and 1844 respectively. Of the two, Landor's venture was more successful and he formed the Wenham Lake Ice Company to export to Britain, building an ice depot on the Strand. Wenham ice was marketed as being unusually pure, possessed of special cooling properties, successfully convincing British customers to avoid local British ice, which was condemned as polluted and unhealthy. After some initial success, the venture eventually failed, {{in part because the}} English chose not to adopt chilled drinks {{in the same way as}} North Americans, but also because of the long distances involved in the trade and the consequent costs of ice wastage through melting. Nonetheless, the trade allowed for some <b>refrigerated</b> <b>goods</b> to arrive in England from America along with ice cargos during the 1840s.|$|E

40|$|Vertical Open Display Cabinets (VODC) {{are widely}} used in {{supermarkets}} for food or drink sales under an adaptive temperature. In this study, one new type VODC which developed based on ice-slurry technology and central refrigeration was established and its thermostatic performances was experimental studied and compared with a conventional one which chilled by refrigerating R 22 directly. The experimental results show that it has <b>good</b> <b>refrigerating</b> effects and few temperature fluctuations. It can basically satisfy food fresh-keeping demands. This new type VODC can operate at high efficiency and save money for the users, indirectly protect our living environment...|$|R

50|$|A covered goods wagon or van is {{a railway}} goods wagon which is {{designed}} for the transportation of moisture-susceptible goods and therefore fully enclosed by sides and a fixed roof. They are often referred to simply as covered wagons, {{and this is the}} term used by the International Union of Railways (UIC). Since the introduction of the international classification for goods wagons by the UIC in the 1960s a distinction has been drawn between ordinary and special covered wagons. Other types of wagon, such as <b>refrigerated</b> vans and <b>goods</b> wagons with opening roofs, are closely related to covered wagons from a design point of view.|$|R

40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{describes the}} development of mathematical model suitable for calculating temperature and humidity response and for simulation of dynamic behaviour of refrigerated products in a cold storage room. Moist air, circulating around refrigerated products within cold chamber is continuously {{in direct contact with}} surface of the goods. Simultaneous heat and mass exchange occurs between <b>refrigerated</b> <b>goods</b> and moist air. During such process mass exchange is considered as evaporation at the product surface exposed to air circulation. Only top surface of the product is therefore drying. This paper is limited to consideration of drying of surface moisture, but not the hygroscopic moisture. Developed mathematical model, describing the dynamic changes of temperature and humidity of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>goods</b> caused by multiple influential factors, is based on mass and energy balances. Such model provides simulation of dynamic behaviour of refrigerated product between temperature ranges of above and below 0 °C (including 0 °C) ...|$|E

30|$|The FloraHolland {{case study}} {{presented}} a similar but also alternative {{set of issues}} and opportunities. Aside from any operational barriers that presented themselves, {{there was a clear}} lack of understanding in the rail sector about the transportation of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>goods.</b> All four case studies identified a demand for time sensitive/perishable goods to be transported by rail, but there were few initiatives or business development opportunities aiming to capture that demand. The requirement was not just the technical solution - a power and control system to adequately provide for the carrying of temperature controlled goods on rail - but also a change in thinking at strategic level within the railway industry, to engage with the market demand and operational requirements. To coin a phrase: ‘no modal shift without mental shift’.|$|E
30|$|The {{research}} explored ‘existing’ and ‘future’ {{rail freight}} solutions for LDHV cargo transport by rail, using a GAP analysis methodology, implemented using an online survey questionnaire, completed by 24 participants. The analysis examined three core themes; ‘Wagon’, ‘Train and Hubs’ and ‘Commercial, Service Quality and Planning’. The {{study found that}} the provision of an electrical power supply to each individual rail freight wagon was deemed important, with the ability to provide power to refrigerated containers for the transportation of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>goods.</b> The ‘Train and Hubs’ theme concentrated in part on terminal operations and facilities and the research findings suggested that greater importance be assigned to terminal access and functionality, rather than to their overall cargo handling capabilities. Regarding ‘Commercial, Service Quality and Planning’, the issue that stood out was the ability to freely integrate, through equal priority, freight and passenger services, which should be considered a key requirement of the railways of the future.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Absorption {{refrigerators}} {{may provide}} a cooling effect using various energy resources in the system such as waste heat and renewable energy. However, supermarket refrigeration systems consume {{a substantial amount of}} energy. Taking for instance supermarket refrigeration systems they can account for up to 50 - 80 % of the total energy consumption in the supermarket. Due to the thermal capacity made up by the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>goods</b> in the system there is a possibility for optimizing the power consumption by utilizing load is describes the dynamics and the modeling of a vapor compression refrigeration system needed for sufficiently realistic estimation of the power consumption and its minimization. This leads to a non-convex function with possibly multiple extrema. Such a function can not directly be optimized by standard methods and a qualitative analysis of the system's constraints is. The focus of the work is on estimating the power consumption of the system while estimating the cold reservoir temperatures as well. The models developed for each module {{as well as for the}} overall integrated system are validated by real data collected from a supermarket in. The results the model is able to estimate the actual electrical power consumption with a high fidelity. Moreover a simulation is introduced based on the produced model for demand-side in direct control of the power/energy consumption is presented by a simple simulation evaporator to the cargo within the container, sensing the temperature of the supply air, comparing the temperature of the supply air with...|$|E
