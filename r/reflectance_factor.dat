The sensor design permits observations up to 45 deg off-nadir in three spectral bands (green, red, and near-infrared). Calibration permits the conversion of sensor data to radiance units with an absolute uncertainty of 6 percent. Observations of five field plots from seven view directions are discussed. Calibration and atmospheric corrections are used to derive hemispherical-directional <b>reflectance</b> <b>factors.</b> A three-term <b>reflectance</b> model is fit to the <b>reflectance</b> <b>factors</b> for each plot to represent the continuous distribution of <b>reflectance</b> <b>factors</b> with view direction.

30|$|Fluctuations in the {{reflectance}} spectra come in {{part from}} the lack of spatial uniformity in the distribution of the scales in the wings {{as well as from the}} reflectance calibration. In the latter, the non-homogeneous spatial distribution of intensity in the white reference image was evaluated taking an additional white and black hyperspectral images. The <b>reflectance</b> <b>factor</b> of the white diffuser was therefore calculated following the same procedure as in the butterfly wings. It was found that variability in the reflectance spectra of the white diffuser at different pixel positions reaches a maximum <b>reflectance</b> <b>factor</b> of 23 % at approximately 502 nm, then decreases, and increases again at longer wavelengths to reach a value of 21 % at 718 nm.

40|$|The {{ability to}} quantitatively and {{spatially}} assess soil surface roughness {{is important in}} geomorphology and land degradation studies. This paper describes {{the results of an}} experiment designed to investigate whether hyperspectral directional <b>reflectance</b> <b>factors</b> can describe fine-scale variations in soil surface roughness. A Canadian silt loam soil was sieved to an aggregate size range of 1 – 4. 75 mm and exposed to five different artificial rainfall durations to produce soils displaying progressively decreasing levels of surface roughness. Each soil state was measured using a point laser profiling instrument at 2 mm spatial resolution, in order to provide information on the structure and spatial arrangement of soil particles. Hyperspectral directional <b>reflectance</b> <b>factors</b> were measured using an Analytical Spectral Devices FieldSpec Pro Spectroradiometer (range 350 – 2500 nm), at a range of measurement angles (θr=- 60 ° to + 60 °) and illumination angle conditions (θi= 28 °– 74 °). Directional <b>reflectance</b> <b>factors</b> varied with illumination and view angles, and with soil structure. Geostatistically-derived indicators of soil surface roughness (sill variance) were regressed with directional <b>reflectance</b> <b>factors.</b> The results showed a strong relationship between directional reflectance and surface roughness (R 2 = 0. 94 where θr=- 60 °, θi= 67 °– 74 °). This fine-scale quasi-natural experiment allowed the control of slope, initial aggregate size and rainfall exposure, permitting an investigation into factors affecting a soil's bidirectional reflectance response. This has highlighted the relationship between fine-scale variations in surface roughness, illumination angle and reflectance response. The results show how the technique could provide a quantitative measure of surface roughness at fine spatial scales...|$|R

40|$|This thesis covers angle-resolved {{spectrophotometric}} {{measurements and}} modelling of diffuse reflectance and luminescence. Most {{of the work}} related to diffuse reflectance is performed in view of providing SI-traceability to radiative transfer codes used in Earth observation. The angle-resolved measurements of luminescent surfaces are used to study goniometrical properties of reflectance and luminescence of reference materials used in appearance measurements. Radiative transfer models that simulate the transmission of light through atmosphere and vegetation are used to interpret the measurements of on-orbit sensors. One way of validating these models is using artificial targets that are characterised by SI-traceable measurements of reflectance and shape. The bidirectional <b>reflectance</b> <b>factors</b> of many roughened anodised and non-anodised surfaces were measured, and {{used to test the}} suitability of micro-facet scattering functions to present the scattering properties of such surfaces. Based on the results, a grooved and an identical flat target were constructed and characterised for bidirectional <b>reflectance</b> <b>factors.</b> The bidirectional <b>reflectance</b> <b>factors</b> of the flat target were used to parametrise the scattering functions for rough surfaces. The grooved target was measured for its coordinates describing shape, which were used to construct a structural model of the grooved target. The structural model, with its optical properties defined by the parametrised scattering functions, was used to simulate the bidirectional <b>reflectance</b> <b>factors</b> of the grooved target with the tested radiative transfer model. The measured and modelled bidirectional <b>reflectance</b> <b>factors</b> agreed within corresponding expanded uncertainties for most of the measured geometries, but not all. Non-Lambertian emission of luminescence from solid luminescent materials has been established, however, instrumentation for angle-resolved measurements of luminescence have not been readily available. The MIKES-Aalto goniofluorometer was extensively characterised to improve the accuracy of bispectral luminescent radiance factor measurements. In addition, a method for goniometrical measurements of quantum efficiency and quantum yield was validated against interlaboratory measurements. The improved measurement capability was used to describe absorbance dependent reflectance angular profiles in solid amorphous luminescent materials. In addition, a reference material for luminescence measurements was proposed and characterised. The new material showed more Lambertian angular luminescence emission and reflectance profiles than the conventionally used materials...|$|R
