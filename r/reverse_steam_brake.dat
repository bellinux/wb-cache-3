50|$|The 3600 {{class were}} fitted with <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear, <b>steam</b> <b>brakes,</b> and two steam-operated water pick-ups for forward and reverse working. This {{reflects}} their intended work as fast suburban engines. About half were employed on such duties in the Birmingham area. The rest {{worked in the}} London area, though later a few worked Chester-Birkenhead trains, and some were allocated to South Wales sheds. They were essentially passenger train locomotives, and were eventually superseded by Collett's 2-6-2Ts. All were withdrawn and scrapped between 1930 and 1934.|$|R
50|$|The engines were {{fitted with}} Pyle National {{turbo-generators}} and headlamps, with the generator {{attached to the}} top of the smokebox, ahead of the chimney. It had the Hasler speed indicator, sight feed lubricators, Hendrie's <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear, <b>steam</b> operation for rocking the firegrate, Gresham and Craven injectors, <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> and combination vacuum ejectors.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were erected at the East London workshops. Apart {{from their}} boilers and cylinders, {{the frame and}} other important components were standard {{with those of the}} Class 14, such as the coupled wheels, bogie, Pyle National turbo-generators and headlamps, Hasler speed indicator, sight feed lubricators, Hendrie's <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear, <b>steam</b> operation for rocking the firegrate, Gresham and Craven injectors, <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> and combination vacuum ejectors. It was also delivered with Type MP1 tenders which had a coal capacity of 10 lt t and a water capacity of 4250 imp gal. One noticeable visible difference from the Class 14 was the absence of the two large sandboxes on each running board.|$|R
50|$|The engine's {{vacuum brake}} {{cylinders}} were fitted outside the main frames under the running boards on each side, between {{the second and}} third pairs of coupled wheels. The vacuum brake operated automatically whenever the train brakes were applied. The use of vacuum <b>braking</b> instead of <b>steam</b> <b>braking</b> became standard practice on locomotives built from 1944 onwards and was welcomed by SAR drivers, who were always reluctant to make use of <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> for fear of skidding the coupled wheels. In practice, the trigger on the <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> attachment to isolate the proportional device which admitted <b>steam</b> to the <b>brake</b> cylinder automatically upon the application of the vacuum brake, was invariably wedged down with a wooden peg by drivers to eliminate the <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> entirely.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> acts {{directly}} and immediately; the sudden {{opening of the}} brake valve {{can result in a}} slight overbraking by locking the wheels. The operation of a <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> therefore requires a great deal of experience from the engine driver.|$|R
50|$|On {{the outward}} trip from Stockport to Buxton that day, Driver Axon had noticed a leak from the {{supply to the}} {{locomotive}} <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> and had requested and received fitter's attention at the Buxton depot. On the return trip from Buxton to Stockport, the repair did not hold and the supply pipe {{broke away from the}} <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> disabling the locomotive <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> and whistle. This filled the locomotive cab with scalding steam and prevented Driver John Axon and Fireman Ron Scanlon from reaching the controls.|$|R
50|$|A <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> can be {{operated}} directly by a lever (valve) and also indirectly {{together with the}} vacuum brake. In the latter case, a control valve linked to the vacuum system controls the admission of <b>steam</b> to the <b>brake</b> cylinder, so that the <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> can be activated automatically in an emergency or if the train separates (the so-called 'automatic steam brake').|$|R
50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are usually}} found today on {{heritage}} steam locomotives.|$|R

50|$|The driver's {{brake valve}} was usually {{combined}} with the <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> control on the locomotive.|$|R
5000|$|J50/3 38 built 1926-30, 4 ft 5 in boiler, <b>steam</b> <b>brake,</b> {{left-hand}} drive, long bunker ...|$|R
50|$|Malcolm was {{interested}} in <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> and took out several patents for improvements {{to this type of}} brake.|$|R
2500|$|The 0-6-4Ts {{were built}} with <b>steam</b> and vacuum <b>brakes</b> and <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear and weighed [...] The 2-6-2Ts were fitted with vacuum brakes only; those built by Beyer weighed [...] and Kitson's [...]|$|R
50|$|The class {{featured}} enclosed wheel splashers and cabs from new, but no brakes {{were initially}} fitted; some received <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> and others vacuum brakes.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> {{is a type}} of <b>brake</b> for <b>steam</b> {{locomotives}} {{and their}} tenders, whereby a steam cylinder works directly on the brake linkages.|$|R
50|$|As {{a direct}} result of the accident, the {{prototype}} Saint class locomotive no. 100 - the first of the GWR's many successful 4-6-0 designs - was fitted with vacuum brakes on all wheels of the locomotive and tender, rather than just the locomotive's <b>steam</b> <b>brake.</b> While the <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> on a locomotive was very powerful, it took time to build up pressure on the initial application when the metal surfaces were cold; on a second application it was far more rapid, but this would not occur in an emergency.|$|R
50|$|The locos have a {{counterweight}} handbrake and a <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> as an auxiliary. Depending on the railway, vacuum or {{compressed air}} brakes were later fitted {{as the train}} brake.|$|R
50|$|Three (8301/08/10) {{were sent}} to Scotland in 1931-32 {{and as a result}} of the move they had their Westinghouse air brake {{replaced}} with a <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> and vacuum ejector.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicles}} were {{equipped with a}} Hartmann <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> and had inside Allan valve gear. The engines were able to haul a 500 tonne train on an incline of 1:300 at 30 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The locos were {{originally}} fitted with dumb buffers, {{but these were}} changed for small round buffers during the 1930s, some also gaining vacuum brakes during this period; only hand and <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> were fitted when built.|$|R
50|$|For braking, the {{locomotives}} {{were originally}} {{equipped with a}} <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> and counterweight brake. In addition the locomotives were fitted for Heberlein brakes. But by 1920 they were given the new Körting vacuum brakes for engine and train.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} driver (US: engineer) worked {{on one side}} of the locomotive, and the fireman on the other; the fireboxes separated them. The regulators for both power bogies were located above the centre of the fireboxes, with the <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> valve at one end.|$|R
25|$|The cab {{controls}} {{were similar to}} those on No.42 except that a <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> was provided in addition to the hand brake. The regulator handle was of the normal vertical type but later a long horizontal piece was secured to it, enabling it to be operated from either side.|$|R
5000|$|The G6 BTP {{were built}} with Westinghouse brakes. These were {{replaced}} with <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> on {{all but two}} of the J77s (Nos. 37 and 1437). These were removed in the late 1930s. Twelve of the J77s received vacuum brakes after 1945. This fitting was usually accompanied by the addition of carriage heating equipment.|$|R
50|$|The {{braking effort}} {{achievable}} was limited, {{and an early}} development was {{the application of a}} <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> to locomotives, where boiler pressure could be applied to brake blocks on the locomotive wheels. It was also unreliable, as the application of brakes by guards depended upon them hearing and responding quickly to a whistle for brakes.|$|R
5000|$|To {{begin with}} most of the {{locomotives}} had a <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> that operated on the second and third coupled axles. The prototype locomotive, No. 736 [...] "KÄNZLI", was initially fitted with a Heberlein brake(!). Several locomotives were later converted to Westinghouse compressed air brakes, the one delivered in 1920, No. 1000, had this on delivery.|$|R
5000|$|Atkinson & Philipson, of the Northumberland Coach Factory, Newcastle-on-Tyne, made {{a car in}} 1896. The Coach Factory {{had been}} in {{business}} since 1774, making mail coaches, then railway carriages for George Stephenson. [...] In 1896 they produced a rather crude-looking <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> with iron-shod wheels, which was advertised in various motor papers. It is unknown if many were sold, but it is unlikely.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>brakes</b> were {{primarily}} used on railways where vacuum brakes {{were used to}} brake the train, but {{where there was no}} vacuum <b>brake</b> on the <b>steam</b> locomotive itself, as for example in the United Kingdom, or where there was only a cable-operated brake (e.g. a Heberlein brake) running along the train, like for example in Saxony on the narrow gauge railways.|$|R
25|$|The {{first two}} {{locomotives}} (St David's and St George) were scrapped {{about the end}} of the nineteenth century, and two new engines were acquired from Andrew Barclay, Sons & Co of Kilmarnock: they were named Fordell, arrived in 1901, and Lord Hobart in 1912. They had <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> (unlike the previous engines which had hand brakes only), and spring buffers for the main line rolling stock.|$|R
50|$|In total, {{there were}} eight G 3's in the Mecklenburg fleet, which had been built between 1887 and 1895. Of these two {{originally}} came from the Lloyd Railway, Neustrelitz - Warnemünde. The engines had a <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> and an outside valve gear of the Allan type. Five engines were intended for transfer to the Deutsche Reichsbahn, to be numbered 53 7201 - 53 7205.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} shunt {{locations}} with tight curves and weight restrictions, two 0-4-0T locomotives were purchased from Neilson and Company {{to one of}} that company's standard designs by the GER, and {{this was followed by}} an order for a further two locomotives in 1876. In 1894-1895 these four locos were rebuilt under James Holden, the work including new boilers, <b>steam</b> <b>brakes,</b> and covered cabs.|$|R
50|$|The {{first two}} {{locomotives}} (St David's and St George) were scrapped {{about the end}} of the nineteenth century, and two new engines were acquired from Andrew Barclay, Sons & Co of Kilmarnock: they were named Fordell, arrived in 1901, and Lord Hobart in 1912. They had <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> (unlike the previous engines which had hand brakes only), and spring buffers for the main line rolling stock.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{had four}} types of brakes: an automatic Knorr air pressure brake system (for use with railroad equipment), a Hardy vacuum brake (used {{in combination with the}} Knorr system when pulling LTM equipment), a direct working air pressure switching brake controlled from two control points {{on both sides of the}} cabin, a hand brake to be operated together with a <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> in case of emergencies.|$|R
5000|$|On 9 February 1957, {{locomotive}} No 48188 was hauling {{a freight}} train that ran away due {{to the failure of}} the <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> pipe in the cab. It collided with a diesel multiple unit at [...] station, Derbyshire. Staff there had enough warning to be able to evacuate the train before the collision. Driver John Axon had remained with the freight and was killed. He was awarded a posthumous George Cross.|$|R
50|$|On steam {{locomotives}} {{without a}} second independent brake system (like e.g. a compressed-air brake, vacuum <b>brake</b> or <b>steam</b> <b>brake)</b> for the engine, {{in addition to the}} usual counterweight or fixed brake, the countersteam brake was used as a <b>braking</b> system. Today, <b>steam</b> locomotives generally have to have two independent brake systems in order to be licensed, so that the countersteam brake is not viewed as a braking system, but is nevertheless still used.|$|R
50|$|The S160's were {{designed}} for quick and efficient building, not long-term operations, thus compromises in design led to some difficulties in operation. The axle-box grease-lubricators were not very efficient, particularly when maintenance procedures lapsed or were delayed for operational war reasons, and so axle-boxes often ran hot. Braking was poor by European standards, with a Westinghouse <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> used for the locomotive, which was woefully insufficient, due to the long distance from the driver's valve to the brake cylinder.|$|R
