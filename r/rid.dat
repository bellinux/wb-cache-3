5|$|After a near {{accident}} {{at the dinner}} table, Marge begs Homer to get <b>rid</b> of the gun. He promises to, but later, Bart and Milhouse {{find it in the}} refrigerator's vegetable crisper. Marge discovers this and berates Homer, then leaves with the children and checks into a motel. That night, Homer hosts an NRA meeting at his house, but the other members kick him out of the association after seeing how recklessly he uses his pistol. Realizing what his behavior has cost him, Homer goes to the motel and tells Marge that he got <b>rid</b> of the gun.|$|E

Doctor Octopus's anti-serum also prevents Osborn's attempts of restoring his powers, ultimately he seeks to <b>rid</b> it in hopes of having them again despite risking his health and sanity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{stiffened}} {{plate with}} <b>rids</b> was {{considered as a}} whole structure. Using energy method the stability of stiffened plates with <b>rids</b> under the longitudinal forces was analyzed. Calculating the potential energy of deformation of plate and that of <b>rids</b> and the work done by the neutral plane forces of plate when the plates were buckled, the formulas of critical loads of the stiffened plate with <b>rids</b> under longitudinal forces were derived from the minimum condition of total potential energy. Using the formulas in this paper engineers can easily calculate the critical loads of the stiffened plate with <b>rids</b> under the boundary conditions: the opposite sides are fixed and the other opposite sides are simply supported, four sides are simply supported. The formula of critical loads of the stiffened plate with <b>rids</b> under other boundary conditions can be derived using the method in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the general causes of real interest rate differentials (<b>rids)</b> for a sample of emerging markets for the period of January 1996 to August 2007. To this end, two methods are applied. The first consists of breaking the variance of <b>rids</b> down into relative purchasing power pariety and uncovered interest rate parity and shows that inflation differentials are the main source of <b>rids</b> variation; while the second method breaks down the <b>rids</b> and nominal interest rate differentials (nids) into nominal and real shocks. Bivariate autoregressive models are estimated under particular identification conditions, having been adequately treated for the identified structural breaks. Impulse response functions and error variance decomposition result in real shocks as being the likely cause of <b>rids...</b>|$|R

5|$|His regents, Armansperg and Rundhart, {{established}} a controversial policy of suppressing the monasteries. This was very upsetting to the Church hierarchy. Russia was self-considered as stalwart defender of Orthodoxy but Orthodox believers {{were found in}} all three parties.

40|$|The {{variance}} of {{real interest rate}} differentials (<b>rids)</b> is decomposed between ex post deviations from relative purchasing power parity and uncovered interest rate parity (UIRP) {{for a set of}} emerging markets from 1995 M 5 to 2004 M 3. The results point out to nominal interest rate differentials and ex post deviations from UIRP as the main source of volatility in <b>rids.</b> In order to uncover the dynamic effects of real and monetary disturbances, I estimated a bivariate VAR with <b>rids</b> and nominal interest rate differentials. Forecast error variance decomposition using short run restrictions on the VAR strongly supports the claim that money shocks are unable to explain the variability of <b>rids</b> at longer horizons. Long-run restrictions results in real shocks as the likely cause of <b>rids.</b> Analysis of impulse response functions demonstrates that the net impact of a (one standard deviation) real shock on <b>rids</b> after 36 months is large.

5|$|Mercer {{travels to}} a bohemian pottery-making commune in Shelter Cove, California where Arlen once lived, but learns that {{he moved to}} Reno, Nevada. He passes through Fallon, Nevada {{to meet up with}} the seductive Joely (Jena Malone), his middle school crush. In Reno, they take ecstasy and almost have sex before Mercer resumes his search for Arlen. Later he finds himself on the set of a pornographic film, where the {{director}} (Julio Oscar Mechoso) tells him that Arlen left to work at a pet store in Sacramento, California. Joely asks Mercer if he can drive her cousin Buddy (Colin Fickes) and his friend <b>Rid</b> (William Lee Scott) to Mojave, California, where they are building their own car. While driving, Mercer finds Kate's YMCA card in the trunk of her car and, now knowing what she looks like, describes a dream to her in which he, Joely, and Kate are dancing in a re-enactment of Bande à parts dance sequence. Not wanting to get sidetracked, he tries to leave the others behind in a motel room, but when Buddy threatens to steal the car, Mercer tells him that the car belongs to his girlfriend, and Buddy, <b>Rid,</b> and Joely leave without Mercer in Kate's car. He hitchhikes to Mojave and finds the salvage yard where Buddy and <b>Rid</b> are working, and retrieves the car.|$|E
