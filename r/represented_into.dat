The best thing he said {{against the use of}} color in marble was to the effect that the whiteness removed the object <b>represented</b> <b>into</b> a sort of spiritual region, and so gave chaste permission to those nudities which would otherwise suggest immodesty. I have myself felt the truth of this in a certain sense of shame as I looked at Gibson's tinted Venus.|$|E

Why, Falstaff's very person {{was nothing but}} scenery. A false face, a false figure, false hands, false legs--scarcely a square inch on which the irrepressible humor of the rogue could break into illustrative touches. And he is so human, so expressive, of so rich a physiognomy. One would rather Mr. Beerbohm Tree should have played the part in his own clever, elegant slimness---that would at least have represented life. A Falstaff all [...] "make-up" [...] is an opaque substance. This seems to {{me an example of}} what the rest still more suggested, that in dealing with a production like the [...] "Merry Wives" [...] really the main quality to put forward is discretion. You must resolve such a production, as a thing <b>represented,</b> <b>into</b> a tone that the imagination can take an aesthetic pleasure in. Its grossness must be transposed, as it were, to a fictive scale, a scale of fainter tints and generalized signs. A filthy, eruptive, realistic Bardolph and Pistol overlay the romantic with the literal. Relegate them and blur them, to the eye; let their blotches be constructive and their raggedness relative.|$|E

Nirdlinger, and Frederick Zimmerman. All were theatrical managers and/or booking agents with influence throughout the country. Frohman and Hayman owned theatres in New York and the surrounding area, Erlanger and Klaw were booking agents for almost all the major theatres in the South, and Nirdlinger and Zimmerman controlled theatres in the Ohio region. Frohman also owned a chain of theatres extending to the West Coast. At lunch, the men discussed the disarray in American theatre. These men had essentially formed {{the outline of the}} Theatrical Syndicate. In order for the Syndicate to succeed, it needed to form a monopoly. Within weeks of their lunch meeting, the men organized all the theatres which they owned or <b>represented</b> <b>into</b> a national chain, marking the beginning of the Theatrical Syndicate.|$|E

If the desire for a Czechoslovak nation had been expressed for a long time, the Slovaks in the 1920s, nevertheless, felt resentment because they were proportionally less <b>represented</b> <b>into</b> the Czechoslovak administration. This, however, {{can be explained by}} the fact that, in Austria-Hungary, the Czechs had the opportunity to develop an elite which could then lead the new country and that such an elite was totally absent in the Slovak population. Moreover, the formation of a Czechoslovak Hussite Church which conducted its services in Czech created large discontent. New national holidays, such as July 6, which commemorated the death of Czech reformer Jan Hus, created opposition within the Catholics. Also during the 1920s, the Slovaks became more and more literate, thus developing their own culture, and the structures promoting such a Slovak culture.|$|E

The knowledge contained in guides is <b>represented</b> <b>into</b> SBVR rules, based on a controlled vocabulary derived from an OWL domain ontology and these rules are implemented into SPARQL queries.
