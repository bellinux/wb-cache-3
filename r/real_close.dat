Available on bootleg compilations such as the multi-disc Making of All Things Must Pass and Songs for Patti – The Mastertape Version, the mixes demonstrate the layers of instrumentation that were combined to form the commercially released recording – ranging from a sparse backing of just guitar, bass and drums, to the larger sound following brass and slide guitar overdubs. Madinger and Easter write that [...] "Let It Down" [...] was [...] "a much rougher, rockin' track in its initial phase", and the mixes provide a [...] "fascinating view" [...] of how the song could have ended up without the heavy production favoured by Spector.

2500|$|World War II {{would see}} the Marine Corps' air arm expand rapidly and extensively. They would reach their peak number of units with 5 air wings, 31 {{aircraft}} groups and 145 flying squadrons. During the war, {{and for the next}} fifty years, the Guadalcanal Campaign would become a defining point for Marine Aviation. The great takeaways were the debilitating effects of not having air superiority, the vulnerability of targets such as transport shipping and the vital importance of quickly acquiring expeditionary airfields during amphibious operations. Because of the way the Pacific War unfolded, Marine Aviation was not able to achieve its 1939 mission of supporting the Fleet Marine Force at first. For {{the first two years of}} the war, the air arm spent most of its time protecting the fleet and land-based installations from attacks by enemy ships and aircraft. This began to change after the Battle of Tarawa as the air support for ground troops flown by Navy pilots left much to be desired. After the battle, General Holland Smith recommended, [...] "Marine aviators, thoroughly schooled in the principles of direct air support," [...] should do the job. The New Georgia Campaign saw the first <b>real</b> <b>close</b> air support provided to Marine ground forces by Marine Air, the Bougainville Campaign and the campaign to retake the Philippines saw the establishment of air liaison parties to coordinate air support with the Marines fighting on the ground, and the Battle of Okinawa brought most of it together with the establishment of aviation command and control in the form of Landing Force Air Support Control Units. During the course of the war, Marine Aviators were credited with shooting down 2,355 Japanese aircraft while losing 573 of their own aircraft in combat, they had 120 aces and earned 11 Medals of Honor. Immediately following the war, the strength of the Marine Corps flying arm was drastically cut as part of the post war drawdown of forces. Their active strength fell from 116,628 personnel and 103 squadrons on 31 August 1945 to 14,163 personnel and 21 squadrons on 30 June 1948. They also maintained another 30 squadrons in the Marine Air Reserve. Also during this time, the Secretary of Defense for then President Harry S. Truman, Louis A. Johnson, attempted to eliminate Marine Corps aviation by transferring its air assets to other services, and even proposed to progressively eliminate the Marine Corps altogether in a series of budget cutbacks and decommissioning of forces.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} characterizations of <b>real</b> <b>closed</b> fields. For example,in terms of maximality (with respect to algebraic extensions): a <b>real</b> <b>closed</b> field is a maximally orderable field; or, a <b>real</b> <b>closed</b> field (together with its unique ordering) is a maximally ordered field. Another characterization says that the intermediate value theorem holds for all polynomials in one variable over the (ordered) field. In the case of commutative rings, all these properties can be (and are) analyzed in the literature. They all lead to different classes of rings which are unfortunately also called 'real closed' (because a certain characterization of <b>real</b> <b>closed</b> fields has been extended to rings).
