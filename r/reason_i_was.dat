The <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> using that concept so much at that point in my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E

It was too dark, too subterranean, and much too horrific. I thought it out-poltered Poltergeist. There's not an ounce of my own personal feeling in Temple of Doom." [...] He later added during the Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom documentary, [...] "Temple of Doom is my least favorite of the trilogy. I look back and I say, 'Well the greatest thing that I got out of that was I met Kate Capshaw.' We married years later and that to me was the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> fated to make Temple of Doom." ...|$|E
500|$|Bruce David Forbes, {{author of}} Religion and Popular Culture in America, {{felt that the}} video drew on Madonna's {{childhood}} experiences and dramatized her efforts to renegotiate these relationships, in her daily interactions with her lover and father, and in relation to Catholicism, which the singer {{referred to in the}} line [...] "Oh father I have sinned". Dunn noticed that like the Pepsi commercial shot for her earlier single [...] "Like a Prayer", Madonna's persona is split into a child and adult, who repeatedly fuse and separate. Leslie C. Dunn commented that as the narrative developed, the child is shown singing, but the adult Madonna's voice is heard, and when the adult Madonna appears in a hallway, her shadow is that of a child. Madonna responded to these observations by saying: [...] "I think the biggest <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to express myself and not be intimidated was not having a mother." ...|$|E

2500|$|Miller then {{attended}} a wilderness expedition trip in Oregon for teenagers. [...] "It {{was not necessarily}} for drug rehabilitation, but {{that was part of}} the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> out there," [...] he explained to a journalist of The Jewish Daily Forward in 2008. He finished high school at a wilderness program in Bend, Oregon. In Oregon, he identified himself as [...] "Matt, the Jewish rapper kid from New York." [...] Matisyahu has contrasted this time in Oregon to his life in New York City. [...] "I was suddenly the token Jew. This was now my search for my own identity, and part of Judaism feeling more important and relevant to me." ...|$|E

[...] He also cited concerns with his Democratic criticism of President Bush; he hadn't attended Democratic caucus meetings for some time due to the criticism leveled at Bush, his longtime friend.

2500|$|In 1984, Lloyd Webber {{contacted}} Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of Cats and Song and Dance, {{to propose}} a new musical. He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested Gaston Leroux's book The Phantom of the Opera as a basis. They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw {{an effective way to}} make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: [...] "I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that ever since I started my career. Then with the Phantom, it was there!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the 1995 Rugby World Cup, Campese {{was dropped}} from the Australian team for their first Bledisloe Cup Test match against New Zealand in Auckland. Following an injury to Australian fullback Matthew Burke in the first Bledisloe Cup Test of 1995 in Auckland, the Australian {{selectors}} picked Rod Kafer to take Burke's place in the Australian team. Kafer then suffered a broken leg during a training session. Campese was then recalled to a training session with the Wallabies, with the information that if Matthew Burke proved his fitness, he would not play in the second Bledisloe Cup Test. Burke recovered from his injury {{to play in the}} second Bledisloe Cup Test. However, another injury to Australian centre Daniel Herbert led to Campese's selection on the bench in the second Bledisloe Cup Test of 1995. In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese wrote that [...] "for some <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> meant to play that weekend against the All Blacks." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Congressional {{testimony}} on October 23, 2008, Greenspan {{acknowledged that he}} was [...] "partially" [...] wrong in opposing regulation and stated [...] "Those {{of us who have}} looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder's equity—myself especially—are in a state of shocked disbelief." [...] Referring to his free-market ideology, Greenspan said: [...] "I have found a flaw. I don't know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact." [...] When Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA) pressed him to clarify his words. [...] "In other words, you found that your view of the world, your ideology, was not right, it was not working," [...] Waxman said. [...] "Absolutely, precisely," [...] Greenspan replied. [...] "You know, that's precisely the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well." [...] Greenspan admitted fault in opposing regulation of derivatives and acknowledged that financial institutions didn't protect shareholders and investments as well as he expected.|$|E
2500|$|Born Marilyn Judith Grove in Auckland, New Zealand, Casali {{left home}} aged {{nineteen}} to travel around Australia, Europe and the United States. In 1967 {{she moved to}} Los Angeles where she met and began a relationship with Roberto Alfredo Vincenzo Casali, an Italian computer engineer, at a ski-club where they were both taking lessons. Casali had been drawing cartoons of humorous incidents on the ski slopes, which Roberto encouraged, and she soon began adding cartoon illustrations to messages which she left for him. The very first drawing was created as a [...] "signature" [...] to a note, and represented Casali herself with freckles, large eyes and long fair hair. She said later of these cartoons: [...] "I began making little drawings to express how I felt... It {{was a little bit}} like keeping a diary that described how my feelings had grown." [...] In the September 1981 Cartoonist Profiles magazine she said: [...] "I drew a round blob of a girl {{who was supposed to be}} me, the one who was feeling all these fantastic things. Then I added a blob of a boy who was the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> feeling these things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trueman's Test career {{ended in}} 1965 {{after he had}} played {{in the first two}} of a three-match series against New Zealand. He bowed out with a then world record of 307 Test wickets at an average of 21.54. Although he was the first bowler to take 300 Test wickets, he had {{undergone}} numerous clashes and problems with the England cricketing hierarchy. He was not involved in the tours of Australia (1954–55); South Africa (1956–57) and (1964–65); India and Pakistan (1961–62); or India (1963–64). From the beginning {{to the end of his}} international career, England played 118 Tests and he missed 51 of them. He recalled in his memoirs: [...] "Irrespective of the fact I was at the top of my game for Yorkshire and frequently topped the county bowling averages, I was often overlooked for England. To my mind the reason for this was personal. Quite simply, some of the selection committee did not like my forthright attitude, which they misinterpreted as being [...] "bolshy". Rather than pick the best eleven players for the job, the selection committee would often choose someone because he was, in their eyes, a gentleman and a decent chap. Such attributes often took precedence over someone's ability to play international cricket". He also wrote: [...] "For this <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> selected for far fewer Tests than I believe I should have been. To my mind, if I'd had the opportunity to play in those Tests, I'm sure I would have topped 400 wickets. But that was not to be, even though I was regularly taking 100-plus wickets a season for Yorkshire".|$|E
