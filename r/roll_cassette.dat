40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of seed cleaning and washing on the incidence of bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice cv. BR 11. Six different treatments were used. They were farmer`s seeds clean seeds, diseased seeds, farmer`s seeds washed with tap water, farmer`s seeds washed with 20 % brine solution and clean seeds washed with tap water. Three seed health testing methods namely paper <b>rolled</b> towel, <b>cassette</b> slide holder and liquid assay method were used for detection of BLB infection in seed.

Incidence of BLB in field plots were recorded at tillering stage and flag leaf stage.
