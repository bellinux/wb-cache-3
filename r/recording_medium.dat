His team is developing a new <b>recording</b> <b>medium</b> that will give the company an edge over its Japanese competitors. They move into a new facility at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use. On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment {{of one of the}} rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted. The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries.|$|E

25|$|Burroughs used {{photography}} extensively {{throughout his}} career, {{both as a}} <b>recording</b> <b>medium</b> in planning his writings, and as a significant dimension of his own artistic practice, in which photographs and other images feature as significant elements in cut-ups. With Ian Sommerville, he experimented with photography's potential {{as a form of}} memory-device, photographing and rephotographing his own pictures in increasingly complex time-image arrangements. (See: Patricia Allmer and John Sears (ed.) Taking Shots: The Photography of William S. Burroughs, London: Prestel and The Photographers' Gallery, 2014).|$|E
25|$|On July 18, 1877, Thomas Edison and {{his team}} invented the phonograph. His first {{successful}} recording and reproduction of intelligible sounds, achieved early in the following December, used a thin sheet of tin foil wrapped around a hand-cranked grooved metal cylinder. Tin foil was not a practical <b>recording</b> <b>medium</b> for either commercial or artistic purposes and the crude hand-cranked phonograph was only marketed as a novelty, to little or no profit. Edison moved on to developing a practical incandescent electric light and the next improvements to sound recording technology were made by others.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the nature}} of the <b>recording</b> <b>medium,</b> {{playback}} of many cylinders can cause degradation of the recording. The replay of cylinders diminishes their fidelity and degrades their recorded signals. Additionally, when exposed to humidity, mold can penetrate cylinders' surface and cause the recordings to have surface noise. Currently, the only professional machine manufactured for the playback of cylinder recordings is the Archéophone player, designed by Henri Chamoux. The Archéophone is used by the Edison National Historic Site, Bowling Green State University (Bowling Green, Ohio), The Department of Special Collections, Donald C Davidson Library at The University of California, Santa Barbara, and many other libraries and archives.|$|E

500|$|The Stone Tape is a {{television}} play directed by Peter Sasdy and starring Michael Bryant, Jane Asher, Michael Bates [...] and Iain Cuthbertson. It was broadcast on BBC Two as a Christmas ghost story in 1972. [...] Combining aspects {{of science fiction}} and horror, the story concerns {{a team of scientists}} who move into their new research facility, a renovated Victorian mansion that has a reputation for being haunted. The team investigate the phenomena, trying to determine if the stones of the building are acting as a <b>recording</b> <b>medium</b> for past events (the [...] "stone tape" [...] of the play's title). However, their investigations serve only to unleash a darker, more malevolent force.|$|E
500|$|Excited by the {{possibilities}} presented by a <b>recording</b> <b>medium</b> {{which uses a}} person's own senses as the means of recording and playback, Brock and his team move into the room. They bombard it with their technology, hoping to find {{the secret of the}} [...] "stone tape" [...] and have it play on demand. Brock is certain that the secret is connected to the walls, but he fails to develop a predictable method of triggering. [...] Under mounting pressure to succeed, Brock uses every available instrumentation, only to be told, by Jill, that the presence she had felt earlier was now gone, apparently meaning that the [...] "tape" [...] has been erased. Brock's failures are compounded when his superiors signal their lost confidence in him, requiring him to share Taskerlands with a rival research team working on a new washing machine.|$|E
500|$|Brock hypothesises {{that it is}} not a ghost, {{but that}} somehow the stone in the room has {{preserved}} an image of the girl's death—this [...] "stone tape" [...] may be the new <b>recording</b> <b>medium</b> they have been seeking. Their scientific devices fail to detect any evidence of the phenomena the team experience, and different team members experience different phenomena: most are able to hear sounds, Jill can also see images, but another member of the team experiences no sensory input. Jill hypothesises that the [...] "tape" [...] does not produce actual sound or light, but instead interfaces with the human nervous system during [...] to create the sensory impression of sound and vision, and some individuals are more sensitive to this than others. She surmises that the recordings are imprinted in moments of extreme emotion, like a kind of telepathy.|$|E

2500|$|Closely {{related to}} {{radiographic}} contrast {{is the concept}} of exposure latitude.

Images having a short-scale of contrast will have narrow exposure latitude. Images having long-scale contrast will have a wide exposure latitude; that is, the radiographer will be able to utilize a broader range of technical factors to produce a diagnostic-quality image.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{seven years}} of {{research}} and experimentation at their Volta Laboratory, Charles Sumner Tainter, Alexander Graham Bell and Chichester Bell introduced wax as the <b>recording</b> <b>medium</b> and engraving, rather than indenting, as the recording method. In 1887, their [...] "Graphophone" [...] system, which recorded dictation on disposable cardboard tubes with a thin wax coating, was being {{put to the test}} of practical use by official reporters of the US Congress, with commercial units later being produced by the Dictaphone Corporation. After this system was demonstrated to Edison's representatives, Edison quickly resumed work on the phonograph. He settled on a thicker all-wax cylinder, the surface of which could be repeatedly shaved down for reuse. Both the Graphophone and Edison's [...] "Perfected Phonograph" [...] were commercialized in 1888. Eventually, a patent-sharing agreement was signed and the wax-coated cardboard tubes were abandoned in favor of Edison's all-wax cylinders as an interchangeable standard format.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} discovery made in {{this period}} was the technique of AC biasing which improved the fidelity of the recorded audio signal by increasing the effective linearity of the <b>recording</b> <b>medium.</b> Ampex Corporation, the American electronics company's first tape recorder, the Ampex Model 200A, was first shipped in April 1948. During the early 1950s Ampex began marketing one- and two-track machines using ¼" [...] tape. The line soon expanded into three- and four-track models using ½" [...] tape. In the early 1950s Ampex moved to 934 Charter St. Redwood City, California. Ampex acquired Orradio Industries in 1959, which became the Ampex Magnetic Tape Division, headquartered in Opelika, Alabama. This made Ampex a manufacturer of both recorders and tape. By {{the end of that}} decade Ampex products were much in demand by top recording studio worldwide. Ampex built a handful of multitrack machines during the late 1950s that could record as many as eight tracks on 1 inch tape. In 1966 Ampex built their first 16-track recorder, the model AG-1000, at the request of Mirasound Studios in New York City. In 1967 Ampex introduced a 16-track version of the MM 1000 which was the world's first 16-track professional tape recorder put into mass-production. Kornél Tolnai often ordered his tapes from the American electronics company Ampex Corporation in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|In 1880, Bell {{received}} the Volta Prize with a purse of 50,000 francs (approximately US$ in today's dollars) for {{the invention of}} the telephone from the Académie française, representing the French government. Among the luminaries who judged were Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. The Volta Prize was conceived by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801, and named in honor of Alessandro Volta, with Bell receiving the third grand prize in its history. Since Bell was becoming increasingly affluent, he used his prize money to create endowment funds (the 'Volta Fund') and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington, D.C.. These included the prestigious 'Volta Laboratory Association' (1880), also known as the Volta Laboratory and as the 'Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory', and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau (1887) as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved Edison's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the <b>recording</b> <b>medium</b> and incising the recording rather than indenting it, key upgrades that Edison himself later adopted. The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his [...] "proudest achievement", [...] "the photophone", the [...] "optical telephone" [...] which presaged fibre optical telecommunications while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (the AG Bell), a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness.|$|E

2500|$|In 1877, Thomas Edison {{invented the}} phonograph. Unlike the phonautograph, it {{was capable of}} both {{recording}} and reproducing sound. Despite the similarity of name, there is no documentary evidence that Edison's phonograph was based on Scott's phonautograph. Edison first tried recording sound on a wax-impregnated paper tape, {{with the idea of}} creating a [...] "telephone repeater" [...] analogous to the telegraph repeater he had been working on. Although the visible results made him confident that sound could be physically recorded and reproduced, his notes do not indicate that he actually reproduced sound before his first experiment in which he used tinfoil as a <b>recording</b> <b>medium</b> several months later. The tinfoil was wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder and a sound-vibrated stylus indented the tinfoil while the cylinder was rotated. The recording could be played back immediately. The Scientific American article that introduced the tinfoil phonograph to the public mentioned Marey, Rosapelly and Barlow as well as Scott as creators of devices for recording but, importantly, not reproducing sound. Edison also invented variations of the phonograph that used tape and disc formats. Numerous applications for the phonograph were envisioned, but although it enjoyed a brief vogue as a startling novelty at public demonstrations, the tinfoil phonograph proved too crude to be put to any practical use. A decade later, Edison developed a greatly improved phonograph that used a hollow wax cylinder instead of a foil sheet. This proved to be both a better-sounding and far more useful and durable device. The wax phonograph cylinder created the recorded sound market {{at the end of the}} 1880s and dominated it through the early years of the 20th century.|$|E
