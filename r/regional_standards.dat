25|$|Romansh {{comprises}} a {{group of}} closely related dialects, which are most commonly divided into five different varieties, {{each of which has}} developed a standardized form. These standardized <b>regional</b> <b>standards</b> are referred to as idioms in Romansh to distinguish them from the local vernaculars, which are referred to as dialects. These dialects form a dialect continuum without clear-cut divisions. Historically a continuous speech area, this continuum has now been ruptured by the spread of German, so that Romansh is now geographically divided into at least two non-adjacent parts.|$|E
25|$|Trinidad and Tobago's {{infrastructure}} is good by <b>regional</b> <b>standards.</b> The {{international airport in}} Trinidad was expanded in 2001. There is an extensive network of paved roads with several good four and six lane highways including one controlled access expressway. The Ministry of Works estimates that an average Trinidadian spends about four hours in traffic per day. Emergency services are reliable, but may suffer delays in rural districts. Private hospitals are available and reliable. Utilities are fairly reliable in the cities. Some areas, however, especially rural districts, still suffer from water shortages.|$|E
25|$|Although {{urban water}} tariffs are high by <b>regional</b> <b>standards</b> (60 KSh or US$0.60 per m3 on average in 2014), these tariffs only allow the {{recovery}} of operating costs, but not {{the recovery of}} capital costs. Full cost recovery is not achieved due to various reasons, including {{a high level of}} non-revenue water (average of 42%). Based on the unit cost of production, the nationwide losses due to non-revenue water in 2014 were estimated at 5.2 billion KSh, equivalent to US$52 million. Another reason is the need to tap distant water sources at a high cost in some locations. For example, Mombasa is supplied from a source located 220km from the city. Although 16% of Kenyans in urban areas have access to sewerage, there is no sewerage levy in Kenya, making this expensive service essentially free of charge.|$|E

25|$|These {{variables}} impacted {{the development}} of military systems. Low population densities for example meant that large forces could not be raised and maintained in being for a long time. The Zulu as one instance, could field an estimated 50,000 warriors, impressive by <b>regional</b> <b>standards.</b> But this was the nation's entire armed strength, whereas more populous European nations during the Napoleonic Wars of the 19th century could routinely put this number of men into a single battle. Political fragmentation also hindered the growth of large armies, and African tribes could be divided and defeated separately by foreign invaders, just as Rome did with numerous tribal opponents in antiquity. Nevertheless, despite such limits, the internal consolidation and growth of African states played {{an important part in}} military transformation. The Zulu system for example did not rely on foreign horses, guns or ships. The evolution of African military systems is thus not a simple tale of outside influences but a complex web of indigenous development that adapted, shaped and sometimes rejected outside technology.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{government}} initiated {{a process of}} restructuring and strengthening the national water utility ONEA, while investing heavily in expanding access {{with the assistance of}} foreign aid. Through this process the utility was transformed {{into one of the most}} successful and efficient water companies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Improving cost recovery was an important element of this process: Tariffs were increased by 30% to almost â‚¬1 per cubic meter, so that ONEA enjoyed a healthy financial situation and reported an accounting profit. Increasing efficiency was another important element: Nonrevenue water declined to 16 percent, an excellent level by <b>regional</b> <b>standards.</b> Labor productivity was increased by reducing the number of employees from 670 in 1991 to 570 in 1995 while the number of customers increased substantially. Furthermore, business procedures were modernized through a computerized customer billing system, customer relations were improved, an internal control system to fight corruption was introduced and a laboratory was established. The mutual responsibilities of the public company and the government were laid out in the form of a Contrat Plan setting quantitative targets over a number of years, as it is common for state-owned enterprises in many Francophone countries.|$|E
