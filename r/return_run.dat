25|$|Endurance Course. This is an {{individual}} test comprising a challenging 6 mile (9.65 kilometres (km)) course whilst carrying 21 lb (9.5 kilogrammes (kg)) ·fighting order and personal weapon. The first two miles consist of undulating woodland terrain featuring obstacles such as tunnels, pipes, wading pools and an underwater culvert. The latter four miles (6.43 km) remain an obstacle-free metalled road <b>return</b> <b>run</b> back to CTCRM. Candidates are to complete this in 73 minutes. This {{is followed by a}} marksmanship test where the candidate must hit 6 out of 10 shots at a target simulating a man at a range of 200 metres.|$|E
25|$|The dates {{presented}} are as {{given by}} Reed. A correspondent in issue 137 of Traction magazine reports some inaccuracies in these dates. For example, the correspondent claims to have seen 828 Magnificent throughout June 1971 and on 4 July 1971 to have seen it hauled dead by NBL type 2 no. 6326 with fire damage and presumed to be heading for withdrawal at Newton Abbot depot. 831 Monarch worked the 16:05 Exeter St David's to Barnstaple service and 17:55 return on 6 October 1971, three days after its supposed withdrawal. 826 Jupiter hauled 808, D819, D822 and 868 on a Newton Abbot to Bristol service on 10 October 1971, being requisitioned at Exeter on its <b>return</b> <b>run</b> to haul the 16:05 Barnstaple service owing to a severe locomotive shortage. 812 is {{claimed to have been}} in use long after 3 November 1971 and although 810 Cockade was withdrawn on 4 November 1971 it was reinstated on the 7th. On that same day, the correspondent notes 814 in use to power a convoy of 832 and 812 to Plymouth Laira depot where 814 was finally withdrawn, with 812 remaining in traffic. The situation with 832 is unclear because of its transfer to the technical department at Derby. The final four Warships of either kind (Class 42 or 43) in BR traffic were thus 810, 812, 821 and 824. 812 was in use on express passenger duties as late as 28 November 1972, over a year since its purported withdrawal. The last four locomotives were officially removed from capital stock on 3 December 1972; 821 Greyhound hauled an afternoon Bristol to Plymouth parcels train on that day, being almost certainly the last BR Warship-hauled revenue-earning train.|$|E
500|$|When {{he went to}} Spain, the King, Carlos II, {{received}} him in {{a private}} interview. By January, he had arrived in Portugal, and from there endeavoured to England, where he met Charles II and Samuel Pepys, who described him as [...] "a very jolly and good comely man." [...] Cosimo was amiably welcomed by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, for his father's perceived protection of Galileo from the Inquisition. On the <b>return</b> <b>run,</b> Cosimo visited Louis XIV and his mother-in-law, Marguerite of Lorraine, in Paris. He arrived back in Florence on 1 November 1669. His travels were described in a detailed journal by his travelling companion Lorenzo, Conte Magalotti (1637-1712).|$|E

50|$|In the 2001 Grand National the riderless Paddy's <b>Return</b> <b>ran</b> {{in front}} of the field as they {{approached}} the fence. This caused a number of horses to be stopped in their tracks or brought down. In total nine horses in the field were taken out of the race at the Canal Turn, including Amberleigh House, who {{went on to win the}} National in 2004. On the final lap Paddy's <b>Return</b> again <b>ran</b> across the fence, but this time Red Marauder, the eventual winner, and Smarty, who eventually took second, avoided the loose horse.|$|R
500|$|The {{first and}} most {{spectacular}} outcome occurred in 1928, when the Pacifics were called upon daily to work the Flying Scotsman train non-stop over the [...] between London and Edinburgh. Initially three A1s and two A3s took turns on this service. The modifications also gave the A1 locomotives greater speed potential, and the proof of this came in 1933 when a high-speed 3-car diesel railcar service had been mooted. As this would have provided limited accommodation for passengers, it was proposed to use steam traction at similar service speeds with six carriages. A trial <b>return</b> <b>run</b> between London and Leeds was made with modified A1 locomotive number 4472, Flying Scotsman; on the return trip with 6coaches weighing [...] it attained [...] (160km/h) just outside [...] in Lincolnshire for just over [...] There were earlier claims to this speed, notably by the Great Western locomotive 3440 City of Truro, but this 1933 run is {{generally considered to be}} the first reliably recorded instance. On a later trial run to Newcastle upon Tyne and back in 1935, A3 number 2750 Papyrus reached [...] hauling [...] at the same spot, maintaining a speed above [...] for 12.5consecutive miles (20.1km), the world record for a non-streamlined locomotive, shared with a French Chapelon Pacific.|$|E

2500|$|In 1996 the Deltic 9000 Fund {{registered}} {{itself at}} Companies House as Deltic 9000 Locomotives Ltd (DNLL) {{with the objective}} of returning its locomotives to main-line service and on 30 November 1996 D9000 [...] hauled the 'Deltic Deliverance' charter from Edinburgh to King's Cross. Although this tour ended prematurely at Berwick-upon-Tweed, D9000 went on to haul many charter trains and service trains for both Anglia Railways and Virgin Trains until 2003. Subsequently, DNLL's other Deltic, D9016 Gordon Highlander returned to main-line working (it was temporarily painted in a purple and grey livery based upon the house colours of Porterbrook Leasing, who helped finance the restoration), as did the Deltic Preservation Society's D9009 Alycidon and D9019 Royal Highland Fusilier. Between 1997 and 2003 all four main-line certified locomotives saw frequent charter and spot hire use, including on the Venice Simplon Orient Express. A highlight of this period was 22 May 1999, when D9000 Royal Scots Grey, D9009 Alycidon and 55 019 Royal Highland Fusilier were all in operation on the East Coast Main Line on the same day – D9000 running the [...] "George Mortimer Pullman" [...] British Pullman between Victoria and Bradford Forster Square and the DPS Deltics working two charter trains between King's Cross and York. On the <b>return</b> <b>run</b> from Bradford, D9000 was held in platform 1 at Doncaster, whilst 55 019 passed on the up through line. D9000 then followed 55 019 as far as Belle Isle, where it diverged for the run around London to Victoria.|$|E

On 19 October, Flying Scotsman left Sydney and, after making an {{overnight}} stop at Junee, it departed for Albury.

50|$|Locally {{the service}} is called the 'Push-and-pull', a term which dates {{from the days of}} steam, when the engine could not change ends at Greenford and so the {{locomotive}} pulled the carriages one way and pushed them on the <b>return</b> <b>run</b> (see GWR Autocoach).

50|$|Sports analysts had {{anticipated}} the contest to be exciting, due {{mainly to the}} matchup between Iowa's strong run defense and Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey, the Heisman Trophy runner-up. McCaffrey led the FBS in the 2015 season with 3,864 all-purpose yards, which came from punt/kick <b>returns,</b> <b>runs</b> from scrimmage, and passes out of the backfield.
