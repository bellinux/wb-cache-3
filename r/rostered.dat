40|$|Aim - To {{identify}} {{and explore the}} relationships between stages of the <b>rostering</b> process and the robustness of the worked <b>roster.</b> Background - Once published, a nurse <b>roster</b> is often subject to many changes. However, post-approval changes and their implications are rarely examined. Consequently, {{there is little evidence}} to determine whether a ‘worked’ <b>roster</b> was safe, efficient or fair. Electronic <b>rostering</b> systems provide greater transparency of the <b>rostering</b> process allowing postapproval changes to be examined more thoroughly. Design - Using quantitative data, this study compares the outcomes from different stages of the <b>roster</b> process with the shifts breaking <b>roster</b> rules. Methods - This study covered the period November 2009 –January 2013 and included forty-two <b>roster</b> periods from fifteen wards. For each of the <b>rosters,</b> data specifying the type of shift assignment (request, manual and automatic) and number of shifts changed after approval (response variables) were captured. Linear regression analysis was then used to {{identify and}} explore the relationships between these response variables and the number of shifts breaking rules. Findings - <b>Roster</b> robustness is unaffected by the number of staff requests, Yet, how shifts are assigned before approval and the number of changes postapproval have a marked effect on the robustness of the <b>roster.</b> Conclusions - <b>Roster</b> ‘robustness’ is determined by the quality of the approved <b>roster</b> and subsequent postapproval demand- and supply-driven changes. Despite evidence that e-rostering can improve <b>roster</b> robustness, many Ward Managers prefer to <b>roster</b> manually. On some wards, <b>rosters</b> are approved, regardless of the number of rule breakages occurring. </p...|$|R

25|$|The AFL has {{garnered}} {{increased interest}} in Ireland due {{to the introduction of}} the International Rules series played between an AFL picked All Australian Team and Ireland. This paved the way for young Irish footballers to be <b>rostered</b> to AFL teams mainly {{due to the fact that}} salaries in the AFL are much larger than that of Gaelic Football although most Irish players fail to make the grade into 1st team football.

40|$|The {{scheduling}} {{of nursing}} time on hospital wards {{is critical to}} the delivery of patient care, resource utilization and employee satisfaction. Over the past decade many hospital wards in the United Kingdom (UK) have moved away from the traditional planning of <b>rosters</b> by a single manager, towards more participative processes known as self-rostering and team <b>rostering.</b> This paper tests the hypothesis, developed from the literature, that the three types of <b>rostering</b> approach may be positioned along a continuum. Self-rostering at one extreme, is conducive to staff empowerment, motivation and <b>roster</b> effectiveness, whilst departmental <b>rostering,</b> at the other, leads to perceived autocracy, reduced empowerment, lower levels of staff motivation and <b>roster</b> effectiveness. Team <b>rostering</b> is positioned mid-way on this continuum. This paper reports the findings of an empirical study of nurse <b>rostering</b> practices in the UK National Health Service (NHS), with a view to developing an understanding of the implications of implementing these three <b>rostering</b> approaches and testing the above hypothesis. The survey of <b>rostering</b> practices in 50 NHS wards, and in-depth case studies of seven wards, revealed that each of the three <b>rostering</b> approaches has benefits and limitations and a picture emerges quite different from that implied by the research hypothesis. Whilst the literature suggests that the choice of <b>rostering</b> approach determines the level of perceived autocracy, staff motivation and <b>roster</b> effectiveness, it is proposed in this paper that selection of <b>rostering</b> approach should be contingent upon operational context. The paper concludes with a framework which stipulates that the choice of <b>rostering</b> approach for a ward should be determined on the basis of four contingent variables, namely, ward size, demand variability, demand predictability, and complexity of skill mix. It is recommended that departmental <b>rostering</b> be applied in large wards with complex <b>rostering</b> problems, whilst team <b>rostering</b> is more appropriate for medium sized wards, and self-rostering appropriate for small wards. ...|$|R
25|$|Manx2's Belfast-Cork route was {{operated}} on the Air Operator Certificate (AOC) of Flightline S.L., based in Barcelona. As such Flightline {{was responsible for}} controlling all operational matters relating to that service. In practice many day-to-day decisions were taken by Manx2 in its Isle of Man office. One such decision was the pairing of Lopez and Cantle to crew flight 7100 on 10 February. Correct adherence to European aviation regulations (EU-OPS) by the AOC-holder should have prevented this inappropriate pairing of a newly promoted captain with a relatively inexperienced first officer. It had come about because Cantle was drafted in to replace the pilot who was originally <b>rostered</b> as first officer for the flight when he became unavailable. Flightline {{was not aware of}} the change in personnel.|$|E
25|$|By February 1982, two N {{sets were}} in service as ACN-BN-BN, having entered service on Monday 5 October 1981. On weekdays, both sets {{ran on the}} 6:50am train from South Geelong to Melbourne; then one set ran a return Horsham then to Geelong, and the other set a return Ballarat then to South Geelong and shunt back to Geelong for {{overnight}} stabling. On weekends, one set ran to Horsham, the other ran four return Geelong trips. On Sundays one of the sets ran Geelong to Spencer Street, then a return to Swan Hill, and finally back to Geelong. The other set was undergoing <b>rostered</b> maintenance. Around this time, the expectation was that by end of 1983, all country services would be provided by steel airconditioned carriages and a small fleet of railmotors and EMUs.|$|E
25|$|The plan as at early 1982 was for all 54 {{carriages}} (not yet 57) to be {{in service}} {{by the end of}} 1983, running services to Warrnambool, Horsham, Shepparton, Geelong and some Bendigo services. All other services were to be provided by the existing S, Z and airconditioned E carriages, plus interurban Comeng type trains running to Traralgon. All carriages were to be formed into semi-fixed 3 or 4-car sets, with schedules built around standard consists to keep runs fast and simple. Additionally, all sets were to include only one conductor/guard van, rather than one each end, to maximise capacity for length and weight of each train set. The roster at the time worked with fourteen interurban trains (plus four on the electrified eastern region), so that would allow enough N sets spare and in <b>rostered</b> maintenance.|$|E

40|$|Aim - To {{examine the}} {{practical}} {{applicability of the}} ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ constraints associated with the ‘nurse <b>rostering</b> problem’ as defined in operations management research literature and thereby investigate the objectivity of the <b>rostering</b> process. Background - In practice, <b>rostering</b> nursing staff is often unrecognized, unrewarded and undervalued; yet, despite four decades of research, operations management has little to offer in terms of faster, safer, fairer or more effective <b>rosters.</b> This paper contrasts the theoretical perceptions of <b>roster</b> ‘constraints’ with the subjective, often political, rules governing practical <b>rosters.</b> Design - Using both qualitative and quantitative data, this inductive study compares the practical process of <b>rostering</b> with that theorized in the nurse <b>rostering</b> problem. Methods - This research spanned 4 years examining the <b>rosters</b> from 28 wards in 14 hospitals. Interviews with senior nursing staff regarding staff levels and with ward managers regarding rules defining the <b>roster</b> were complemented by analysis of actual <b>roster</b> data to establish the number and type of unfilled shifts and rule breakages. Interviews were analysed using thematic content analysis and <b>roster</b> data were evaluated using the HealthRoster™ e-rostering system. Findings - Often the rules governing how nursing staff are scheduled are undocumented, tacit and informal. Furthermore, the <b>roster</b> process can be highly politicized, leading to forms of ‘information anarchy’ or ‘information feudalism’ on the ward. Conclusions - Hospital managers must understand that <b>roster</b> design has {{a major impact on}} ward performance and must develop clear <b>roster</b> policies that define staff levels, skill mix, shift patterns and the rules used in preparing the <b>roster.</b> </p...|$|R
25|$|Currently NSW Ambulance {{operates}} six primary rescue {{units in}} rural NSW and employs over 200 rescue officers. The rural stations are located at Rutherford, Tamworth, Singleton, Cowra, Bomaderry and Wagga Wagga. Officers are trained for {{all forms of}} rescue including, road crash, vertical, confined space, swift water, trench, industrial, technical and domestic to name a few. They learn navigation skills, four wheel driving, urban search and rescue, and chemical biological and radiological procedures. Rescue training commences with the recruitment of up to 12 officers, who are selected to undergo a rigorous six week training course. On successful completion of the course, officers are then <b>rostered</b> to rescue units where training continues with a minimum eight hours of structured training per month.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a shift <b>rostering</b> problem that surprisingly {{has not been}} studied in literature: the weekend shift <b>rostering</b> problem. It is motivated by our experience that employees’ shift preferences predominantly focus on the weekends, since many social activities happen during weekends. The Weekend <b>Rostering</b> Problem (WRP) addresses the <b>rostering</b> of weekend shifts, for which we design a problem specific heuristic. We consider the WRP as {{the first phase of}} the shift <b>rostering</b> problem. To complete the shift <b>roster,</b> the second phase assigns the weekday shifts using an existing algorithm. We discuss effects of this two-phase approach both on the weekend shift <b>roster</b> and on the <b>roster</b> as a whole. We demonstrate that our first-phase heuristic is effective both on generated instances and real-life instances. For situations where the weekend shift <b>roster</b> is one of the key determinants of the quality of the complete <b>roster,</b> our two-phase approach shows to be effective when incorporated in a commercially implemented algorithm...|$|R
