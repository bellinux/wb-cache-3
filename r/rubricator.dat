5000|$|Quite {{commonly}} the manuscript's initial scribe {{would provide}} notes to the <b>rubricator</b> {{in the form}} of annotations made in the margins of the text. Such notes were effectively indications to [...] "rubricate here" [...] or [...] "add rubric". In many other cases, the initial scribe also held the position of <b>rubricator,</b> and so he applied rubrication as needed without the use of annotations. This is important, as a scribe's annotations to the <b>rubricator</b> can be used along with codicology to establish a manuscript's history, or provenance.|$|E

25|$|Initially the rubrics— the {{headings}} {{before each}} {{book of the}} Bible— were printed, but this practice was quickly abandoned, and gaps were left for rubrication to be added by hand. A guide of the text {{to be added to}} each page, printed for use by <b>rubricators,</b> survives.|$|R
5000|$|Rubrication was one {{of several}} steps in the medieval process of {{manuscript}} making. Practitioners of rubrication, so-called <b>rubricators,</b> were specialized scribes who received text from the manuscript's original scribe and supplemented it with additional text in red ink for emphasis. The term rubrication comes from the Latin rubrico, [...] "to color red".|$|R
5000|$|The Psalter is the {{earliest}} European {{book with a}} printed date of publication, though not the first printed book to feature a date associated with its production: in August 1456 the binder and <b>rubricator</b> of {{a copy of the}} Gutenberg Bible added handwritten dates to show when these tasks were completed.|$|E
5000|$|The date [...] "1461" [...] {{was marked}} by a <b>rubricator</b> (a scribe who hand-wrote {{initials}} and other items in red text, for decoration or emphasis) written in one copy of the 36-line Bible, indicating {{that it would not}} have been printed any later than this. Most scholars now agree that the 36-line Bible can be dated to c. 1458 - 60, making it the second printed edition of the Bible.|$|E
5000|$|The title [...] "generally {{was written}} {{in one or more}} lines that the scribe of the text had left blank to receive the title", showing both the {{importance}} of the section and the knowledge one may gain from this process. As mentioned above, the initial scribe of a text often left notes for the <b>rubricator</b> of where rubrication would be necessary, a fact that helps the modern historian learn of the provenance of the manuscript. Rubrication affected how later generations read and interpreted a text, and this process helped ensure editorial standardization throughout Western Europe.|$|E

Saint Quirinus, Saint Margaret and two other saints are missing; at least five to eight other leaves are missing, too.

5000|$|The first way {{to divide}} {{sentences}} into groups in Ancient Greek {{was the original}} paragraphos, which was a horizontal line in the margin {{to the left of}} the main text. As the paragraphos became more popular, the horizontal line eventually changed into the Greek letter Gamma (Γ and γ) and later into litterae notabiliores, which were enlarged letters at the beginning of a paragraph. This notation soon changed to the letter K which was an abbreviation for the Latin word kaput, which translates as [...] "head," [...] i.e. it marks the head of a new thesis. Eventually, to mark a new section, the Latin word capitulum, which translates as [...] "little head" [...] was used, and the letter C came to mark a new section in 300 BC. In the 1100s, C had completely replaced K as the symbol for a new chapter. <b>Rubricators</b> eventually added one or two vertical bars to the C to stylize it (as ⸿); the symbol was filled in with dark ink and eventually looked like the modern pilcrow (¶).|$|R
40|$|The goal is {{to study}} {{thesaurus}} as an instrument to define the classification of economic sciences, to adapt their classification to the increased information flow, to increase accuracy of allocation of information resources with consideration of the users’ needs, to suggest making alterations in the classification of economic sciences made by the Institute of Scientific Information for Social Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences (INION RAN) in 2001. The authors see the classification of economic sciences {{as a product of}} social communications theory – a differentiated aspect of social research. Modern science is subdivided into various aspects with varied subjects and methods. The latter overlap and form a hierarchy of concepts in science within the same research subject. The authors stress the importance of information retrieval systems for developing scientific knowledge. Information retrieval systems can immediately deliver data from different areas of science to the user who can then integrate the information and obtain a vivid picture of the research subject. Search engines and <b>rubricators</b> are becoming increasingly important as {{there is a tendency to}} isolated thinking with many Internet users. The authors have devised a certain approach to using the thesaurus as the means of sciences classification and as a hyper language of science. The suggested methodological approach to structuring terms and notions via thesaurus have been tested at Syktyvkar State University and Syktyvkar branch of Saint-Petersburg Economic University. Methods : deduction, induction, analysis, synthesis, abstraction technique, classification. Results : there have been defined stages and main sections of the information-retrieval thesaurus of the hyperlanguage of economic science on the basis of existing classification systems of scientific knowledge. Scope of application of results : library services, information technology, education. DOI:  [URL] </p...|$|R

Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Healthcare Ministry of Russia, 6 Department of Differential Diagnostics, Federal Central Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Moscow, Russia; 7 Pneumology Department, University Hospital Vall d’Hebron, Ciber de Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERES), Barcelona, Spain Abstract: The high {{prevalence}} of COPD together with its {{high level of}} misdiagnosis and late diagnosis dictate the necessity for {{the development and implementation}} of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in order to improve the management of this disease. High-quality, evidence-based international CPGs need to be adapted to the particular situation of each country or region. A new version of the Russian Respiratory Society guidelines released at the end of 2016 was based on the proposal by Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease but adapted to the characteristics of the Russian health system and included an algorithm of pharmacologic treatment of COPD. The proposed algorithm had to comply with the requirements of the Russian Ministry of Health to be included into the unified electronic <b>rubricator,</b> which required a balance between the level of information and the simplicity of the graphic design. This was achieved by: exclusion of the initial diagnostic process, grouping together the common pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures for all patients, and the decision not to use the letters A–D for simplicity and clarity. At all stages of the treatment algorithm, efficacy and safety have to be carefully assessed. Escalation and de-escalation is possible in the case of lack of or insufficient efficacy or safety issues. Bronchodilators should not be discontinued except in the case of significant side effects. At the same time, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) withdrawal is not represented in the algorithm, because it was agreed that there is insufficient evidence to establish clear criteria for ICSs discontinuation. Finally, based on the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease statement, the proposed algorithm reflects and summarizes different approaches to the pharmacological treatment of COPD taking into account the reality of health care in the Russian Federation.
