5|$|Following the {{periodic}} trend, oganesson {{would be expected}} to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive. In addition to being far more reactive than radon, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and copernicium, which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a <b>radial</b> <b>expansion</b> of the last occupied 7p-subshell. More precisely, considerable spin–orbit interactions between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s2 electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and a significant decrease in stabilization of the closed shell of oganesson. It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy—or in other words, it exhibits positive electron affinity, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p3/2 level.|$|E

500|$|Modes are {{numbered}} {{according to the}} number of half-wavelengths in the vibration. [...] Some modes exhibit vibrations in more than one direction (such as drumhead mode which has two) and consequently the mode number consists of more than one number. [...] When the vibration is in one of the higher modes, there will be multiple nodes on the resonator where there is no motion. For some types of resonator, this can provide a convenient place to make a mechanical attachment for structural support. Wires attached at nodes will have no effect on the vibration of the resonator or the overall filter response. In figure 5, some possible anchor points are shown as wires attached at the nodes. The modes shown are (5a) the second longitudinal mode fixed at one end, (5b) the first torsional mode, (5c) the second torsional mode, (5d) the second flexural mode, (5e) first <b>radial</b> <b>expansion</b> mode and (5f) first radially symmetric drumhead mode.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Although {{it is well}} {{established}} that males acquire more bone mass than females, the underlying mechanism and timing of this sex difference remain controversial. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the relative contribution of sex steroid versus GH-IGF-I action to pubertal bone mass acquisition longitudinally in pubertal mice. <b>Radial</b> bone <b>expansion</b> peaked during early puberty (3 - 5 weeks of age) in male and female mice, with significantly more expansion in males compared to females (+ 40 %). Concomitantly, in 5 -week-old male versus female mice, periosteal and endocortical bone formation were higher (+ 70 %) and lower (- 47 %), respectively, along with higher serum IGF-I levels during early puberty in male mice. In female mice, ovariectomy increased <b>radial</b> bone <b>expansion</b> during early puberty as well as the endocortical perimeter. In male mice, orchidectomy reduced <b>radial</b> bone <b>expansion</b> only during late puberty (5 - 8 weeks of age), while combined androgen and estrogen deficiency modestly decreased <b>radial</b> bone <b>expansion</b> during early puberty, accompanied by lower IGF-I levels. GHRKO mice with very low IGF-I levels, on the other hand, showed limited <b>radial</b> bone <b>expansion</b> and no skeletal dimorphism. From these data, we conclude that skeletal sexual dimorphism is established during early puberty and depends primarily on GH-IGF-I action. In males, androgens and estrogens have stimulatory effects on bone size during late and early puberty, respectively. In females, estrogens limit bone size during early puberty. These longitudinal findings in mice provide strong evidence that skeletal dimorphism is determined by independent and time-specific effects of sex steroids and IGF-I. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{for the detection}} of coronal mass ejection (CME) speeds using image processing was applied. This technique permits us to determine the CME dynamics: <b>radial</b> and <b>expansion</b> distances, velocities, and accelerations. The CME dynamics is determined by the selection of a radial direction in a given Large Angle and Spectroscopic Coronagraph image, which starts just before the occulter (close to the center) and extends to the extremity of the image. By taking a series of images and extracting the same radial direction, it is possible to have a time history of any moving feature along this direction. This technique allows us to choose the number of directions that is used in the CME detection to determine its dynamics.

Here, we report the disentanglement of axial and <b>radial</b> <b>expansions</b> of carbon nanotubes, and the direct role of electronic and vibrational excitations in determining such expansions. With subpicosecond and subpicometer resolutions, structural dynamics were explored by monitoring changes of the electron diffraction following an ultrafast optical excitation, whereas the transient behavior of the charge distribution was probed by time-resolved, electron-energy-loss spectroscopy. Our experimental results, and supporting density functional theory calculations, indicate that a population of the excited carriers in the antibonding orbitals of the nanotube walls drives a transient axial deformation in ∼ 1 ps; this deformation relaxes on a much longer time scale, 17 ps, by nonradiative decay. The electron-driven expansion is distinct from the phonon-driven dynamics observed along the radial direction, using the characteristic Bragg reflections; it occurs in 5 ps.

The Chebyshev-collocation method applied in the radial and axial directions, and the Fourier–Galerkin approximation used in the azimuthal direction lead to a sequence of two-dimensional Helmholtz and Poisson equations for every azimuthal coefficient that are solved by a diagonalization technique. <b>Radial</b> <b>expansions</b> are considered in the diameter of the cell in order to avoid clustering about the axis, and the number of points are selected to ensure that r= 0 is not a collocation point.
