2500|$|Bituminous surface {{treatment}} (BST) or chipseal is used mainly on low-traffic roads, {{but also as}} a sealing coat to rejuvenate an asphalt concrete pavement. It generally consists of aggregate spread over a sprayed-on asphalt emulsion or cut-back asphalt cement. The aggregate is then embedded into the asphalt by rolling it, typically with a <b>rubber-tired</b> <b>roller.</b> [...] This type of surface is described by a wide variety of regional terms including [...] "chip seal", [...] "tar and chip", [...] "oil and stone", [...] "seal coat", [...] "sprayed seal" [...] or [...] "surface dressing" [...] or as simply [...] "bitumin." ...|$|E
40|$|Water {{harvesting}} is {{a potential}} source of water for arid and semiarid lands. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine combinations of land surface treatments and land forming which result in efficient but inexpensive water harvesting catchments and to determine the optimum shape of catchments. In laboratory studies with inexpensive materials, crude oils exhibited the best sealing properties. However, by six months after application, 750 gal per ac of crude oil had no apparent effect on runoff from field plots. Water harvesting catchments constructed by grading the soil to form V-shaped valleys and then compacting the surface yielded runoff equal to 31 to 43 percent of all precipitation After rains, sand blown from such catchments may damage tender downwind vegetation. Some water erosion occurred, but, after two years, the basic shape and the performance of the catchments had not been damaged by erosion. Chemical weed control is recommended. Hydrographs were successfully modeled by the kinematic wave method. Hydrologic parameters were estimated by a univariate procedure. The initial infiltration of the soil surface had the greatest effect on the amount of runoff. Thus, additional or repeated compaction may be the best practice for increasing runoff from such surfaces. Surface roughness had little effect on the amount of runoff. The results of hydrograph simulation indicate that catchments should be as narrow as can be constructed easily with conventional equipment. A catchment width of 16 ft may be about optimum. Catchment side slopes should be between 0. 1 and 0. 20 Generally, catchments should be no more than 1 / 8 mi long. With these side slopes and lengths, channel slopes can be as little as 0. 002 without causing excessive loss of runoff. To prevent erosion, channel slopes should not exceed 0. 005. Catchment surfaces should be wetted by rain or by sprinkling before rolling. Surfaces should be rolled with a <b>rubber-tired</b> <b>roller</b> for 1. 5 to 3 hrs per ac. Drop structures should be installed at elevation changes to prevent erosion. The cost of constructing graded catchments should be $ 55 per ac or less. The cost of harvested water is expected to be about $ 8. 00 per ac-in. Efficiently-utilized natural runoff should be less expensive water...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of {{comparative}} tests on sections of asphalt pavement rolled with conventional steel-wheel rollers and those rolled with a ntb-ber-tire roller added between the steel-wheel breakdown and steel wheel finish roll-ers. Nuclear density and air voids were used as measures of potential differences between sections. Of the 15 projects tested, which included 90 comparisons of aver-ages and standard deviation, the sections rolled with the <b>rubber-tire</b> <b>roller</b> added were statistically significantly (a =. 05) "better " in only 11 percent. Sections rolled with the conventional steel-wheel rollers were statistically significantly (a =. 05) "better " in 13 percent. In the author's opinion, this does not indicate that the addi-tion of the <b>rubber-tire</b> <b>roller</b> was actually detrimental. There were most likely other variables in the pavement, rolling, and/or testing that created the differences. How-ever, {{it is obvious that}} this testing showed no consistent measurable benefit as a re-sult of the addition of a <b>rubber-tire</b> <b>roller.</b> FINAL REPOR...|$|R
50|$|The Akatsiya chassis Objekt 303 {{is based}} on that of the Object 123 tracked chassis of the 2K11 Krug surface-to-air missile system; it {{includes}} six (rather than seven as in the 2K11 Krug) twin rubber-tired road wheels, four <b>rubber-tired</b> return <b>rollers</b> (two single and two twin), front drive sprocket with detachable sprocket rings (lantern-wheel gear) and idler wheel per side. The track is 14.375 m long, 482 mm wide and has 115 links. The Akatsiya can cross 0.7 m high vertical obstacles, 3.0 m wide trenches, 1.05 m fording depth and climb 30Â° gradients. It can be transported by transport plane An-22 (carries two self-propelled howitzers of this type).|$|R
500|$|The next version, the Ausf.H, began {{production}} in June 1943 {{and received the}} designation Sd.Kfz.161/2. The integrity of the glacis armor was improved by manufacturing it as a single [...] plate. A reinforced final drive with higher gear ratios was introduced. To prevent adhesion of magnetic anti-tank mines, which the Germans feared would be used in large numbers by the Allies, Zimmerit paste was added to all the vertical surfaces of the tank's armor. The turret roof was reinforced from [...] to [...] and [...] segments. The vehicle's side and turret were further protected {{by the addition of}} [...] hull skirts and [...] turret skirts. This resulted in the elimination of the vision ports located on the hull side, as the skirts obstructed their view. During the Ausf.H's production run, its <b>rubber-tired</b> return <b>rollers</b> were replaced with cast steel, a lighter cast front sprocket and rear idler wheel gradually replaced the previous components, the hull was fitted with triangular supports for the easily damaged side skirts, the Nebelwurfgeraet was discontinued, and a mount in the turret roof, designed for the Nahverteidigungswaffe, was plugged by a circular armored plate due to initial production shortages of this weapon.|$|R
