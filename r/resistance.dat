5|$|Drug <b>resistance</b> poses {{a growing}} problem in 21st-century malaria treatment. <b>Resistance</b> is now common against all classes of {{antimalarial}} drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world. Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable. Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years {{and the availability of}} substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype. <b>Resistance</b> to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, and there has been emerging <b>resistance</b> in Laos.|$|E

5|$|For decades, {{research}} on the Polish Underground State was restricted, largely because the communist People's Republic of Poland {{did not wish to}} fully acknowledge the role of the non-communist <b>resistance.</b> During the first postwar Stalinist years, efforts to explore this topic were regarded as dangerous, bordering on illegal. Research into the events occurring in the Soviet-annexed territories in the 1939–1941 period was particularly difficult. The limited research devoted to the Underground State that did take place was done mainly by Polish émigré historians living in the West. The communist state downplayed the importance of the non-communist <b>resistance</b> movements, while the communist movement (Armia Ludowa) was emphasized as being of primary importance; in fact, the opposite was true. The absence of research by Polish scholars, along with obstacles presented to foreign scholars seeking access to source material in communist Poland, contributed to a situation in which there was virtually no discussion by Western scholars of one of Europe's largest <b>resistance</b> movements—the non-communist Polish <b>resistance</b> movement.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports a}} series of {{centrifuge}} model tests on torsionally loaded 12, 22, and 33 pile groups in sand. The objectives of the paper are to investigate: 1 {{the response of the}} pile groups subjected to torsion; 2 {{the way in which the}} applied torque is transferred in the pile groups; 3 the internal forces mobilized in these torsionally loaded pile groups and their contributions to resist the applied torque; and 4 the influence factors that affect the load transfer, such as soil density and pile-cap connection. In these model tests, the group torsional <b>resistances</b> of the pile groups increased monotonically in the test range of twist angles up to 8 °. Both torsional and lateral <b>resistances</b> of the individual piles were simultaneously mobilized to resist the applied torque. The torsional <b>resistances</b> were substantially mobilized at small twist angles, while the lateral <b>resistances</b> kept increasing in the whole range of twist angles. Thus, the contribution of the torsional <b>resistances</b> to the applied torque decreased at large twist angles. The piles at different locations in a pile group could develop not only different horizontal displacements, but also different pile–soil–pile interactions and load–deformation coupling effect, hence, the torsional and lateral <b>resistances</b> of the piles are a function of pile location.
