500|$|However, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, {{who were}} awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics, {{attacked}} the Nobel committee as [...] "retired Norwegian politicians {{who have spent}} all their careers in a safe environment, in an oil-rich modern country.

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, {{developing}} modernist ideas <b>regarding</b> <b>politics</b> {{and the role}} of government placed the role of the judiciary into flux. The courts were generally moving away from what has been called [...] "guardian review" [...] — in which judges defended the line between appropriate legislative advances and majoritarian encroachments into the private sphere of life — toward a position of [...] "bifurcated review". This approach favored sorting laws into categories that demanded deference towards other branches of government in the economic sphere, but aggressively heightened judicial scrutiny with respect to fundamental civil and political liberties. The slow transformation away from the [...] "guardian review" [...] role of the judiciary brought about the ideological—and, to a degree, generational—rift in the 1930s judiciary. With the Judiciary Bill, Roosevelt sought to accelerate this judicial evolution by diminishing the dominance of an older generation of judges who remained attached to an earlier mode of American jurisprudence.|$|E
