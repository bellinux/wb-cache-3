40|$|A {{small group}} of fruticous lichen species, viz. Cetraria nivalis, Cladonia mitis, C. stellaris, and Stereocaulon paschale forms {{extensive}} mats in the most winter habitats of Rangifer tarandus populations in Norway. The plant communities accessible for grazing are often found on easily drained, moraine ridges. These lichen species are perennial, {{lying on the ground}} while growing slowly at the top. As they decompose they add humus {{to the top of the}} soil profile. The lichen mats catch all water from small showers, thus preventing vascular plants from obtaining a more regular water supply. Grazing <b>removs</b> whole plants and gradually makes larger and larger holes in the lichen mats. Wind and water erode the humus, with only coarse gravel remaining. This diminishes the soil water storage capacity. Without grazing, lichens will gradually build a humus layer, which would improve the soil water storage capacity. In time vascular plants then would take the place of the lichens. I propose the hypothesis that by (over-) grazing Rangifer improve their winter pastures by making conditions more favourable for lichens than for vascular plants. The fact that lichens are more scarce on habitats with more and regular precipitation, 1) in more oceanic climates, 2) on soils with more silt, and 3) on bird perches with thick peat due to regular fertilising, support this hypothesis...|$|R

The apparent discrepancy in the subcellular location of U-antigen in SV 40 -transformed cells (nuclear location) and in hybrid virus-infected cells (perinuclear location) as determined by immunofluorescence staining of methanol/acetone-fixed cells could be resolved by treating hybrid virus-infected cells with a hypotonic KCl solution before fixation. Upon this treatment hybrid virus-infected cells also showed nuclear U-antigen staining. The possibility of an association of T- and U-antigens with different nuclear subfractions in SV 40 -transformed cells was investigated. Detergent-cleaned nuclei of SV 40 -transformed cells were fractionated into nuclear matrices and a DNase-treated, high-salt nuclear extract. Analysis of the nuclear matrices by immunofluorescence microscopy with T+U+ and T+U- hamster SV 40 tumor serum revealed that U-antigen remained associated with the nuclear matrices, whereas T-antigen could not be detected in this nuclear subfraction.

The increase in time selectivity is more favorable for the channel decoder at the receiver.

Average volumetric soil moisture contents in the peat (2 cm below the surface) of the SPHAG and <b>REMOV</b> substrates were similar (86 %), but greater than in BARE peat (78 %). In a location not manipulated for this experiment, where Sphagnum cushions have re-established on bare cutover peat, beneath the cushions was 5 – 14 % greater than in bare cutover peat directly adjacent to it, indicating that cushions can regulate local substrate water storage, and benefit from it during periods of increased water demand.
