He commanded her for five years along her route from Liverpool to Saint John, New Brunswick stopping at Belfast and Greenock. He also briefly commanded her on the New York City to Bermuda route. It was during this period, in 1929, that he was awarded the Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve (RD) in honour of his long service and in 1935 he was made a full Naval Reserve Captain. He maintained his connection with the RNR throughout his life, becoming Honorary President of the RNR Officer's Club and a part-time naval aide-de-camp to King George VI in 1941 – a position he held part-time throughout World War II. A special warrant was written in 1927 that allowed him to fly the Blue Ensign from any ship, mercantile or military, which he commanded.|$|E

I argue that demographic explanations of workforce ageing ignore the historical context {{in the public sector}} environment. This research explores the factors underpinning ageing public workforces, through a study of the Queensland public service. It finds that ageing public workforces are not a new or recent phenomenon, but occurred whenever there was a change in the traditional youth <b>recruitment</b> <b>policies.</b> These youth <b>recruitment</b> <b>policies</b> were temporarily relaxed during world wars and permanently removed in the 1970 s. On each occasion, this led to an ageing of the public service workforce. Public service personnel agencies failed to predict this trend in the 1940 s or the 1970 s. This understanding of the relationship between <b>recruitment</b> <b>policies</b> and ageing public workforces should be factored into any attempts to address the age of public workforces...|$|R

25|$|Large {{number of}} Indian troops had begun {{arriving}} in Malayan peninsula and Singapore by 1941, {{as a part}} of defensive preparations for possible war with Japan. It was estimated that were some 37 000 Indian troops stationed in these areas, making up roughly about the 40 percent of the total military strength of the British forces. The British-Indian troops swelled from 200 000 to 900 000 between 1939 and 1941. However, these deployments were beset with a number of problems. The troops were too thinly, with insufficient resources and supplies in the Malay Peninsula and Singapore. Further, {{a large proportion of the}} British-Indian troops were very young recruits (as a result of the open <b>recruitment</b> <b>policy</b> of the British) who had very little or no combat training and experience, leading to anxiety amongst the British-Indian forces. Feelings of discrimination amongst British Indian soldiers, compared to the pay and service conditions for European soldiers crreated acrimony. Indiscriminate recruitment by the Indina government in order to maintain the numbers for its army, meant that it was no longer carefully curating its selection for the armed forces. By 1941, British abuse, both verbal and physical of the Indian soldiers was rampant.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of Bajana's arrival in the Somerset team, the county were {{struggling}} {{to compete in the}} County Championship, and were making a financial loss. In three of the four years prior to 1912, Somerset had finished bottom of the championship table, and there was little improvement in the final three years before the First World War, each of which resulted in a bottom-three finish. The Somerset cricket historian, David Foot, records that at this time, the county's <b>recruitment</b> <b>policy</b> was [...] "susceptible to exotic grandeur and haughty lineage," [...] and suggested that a player's cricketing ability was often a secondary consideration to their social standing. Bajana made his debut for Somerset in May 1912, opening the batting for the county against Sussex. He scored twenty-two and seven in a six-wicket victory for his county. In the subsequent match, against Hampshire, Bajana scored his first half-century in county cricket, hitting 71 runs in the second innings; the highest score of any Somerset batsman in the match. He passed 50 on three further occasions that year, and along with Len Braund and Ernie Robson, was ever-present in the Somerset team that season. His year's aggregate of 575 runs in the County Championship, and his score of 95, made against Worcestershire in August, were both the county's best that season, in a year in which no player scored a century for Somerset.|$|E

The force would be based upon the five divisions of the old AIF, although it was decided to limit the overall number of units. This force would also be armed with modern weapons and equipment. [...] That, at least, was the promise, however, in reality this never came to fruition and to a large extent they continued to be trained and equipped with 1914–18 equipment right up to and during World War II. The result of this change in <b>recruitment</b> <b>policy</b> was a huge drop {{in the size of the}} Army, as numbers fell by almost 20,000 in one year as there was little prospect for training and as the financial difficulties of the Great Depression began to be felt. As a result, in 1930 the decision was made to disband or amalgamate a number of units and five infantry battalions and two light horse regiments were removed from the order of battle. The following year, nine more infantry battalions were disbanded.|$|E

40|$|Human capital factor endowments {{have become}} one of the main {{determinants}} of international competitiveness. Both to catch up in the technological race and to increase the long-term flexibility of the workforce, industrialized countries require a highly skilled labour force. This paper analyzes the skills upgrading process in the European Union, as reflected in shifts in the occupational structure of employment and changes in the skill requirements in the various occupational fields. We distinguish between upgrading by <b>recruitment</b> <b>policies</b> and by training policies. Labour Force Survey data shows an increase in skill levels and rather stable participation in continuing vocational education. The data also reveal diverging trends, in the period 1983 - 1991, between the various Member States of the European Union, both with regard to the skill level of the working population and the rate of participation in training activities. Estimation results show that, in general, intermediate skilled workers participate more in training activities than highly skilled workers. This suggests some substitutability between initial education (i. e. <b>recruitment</b> <b>policies)</b> and continuing training. However, if we correct for the occupational field in which workers are employed, <b>recruitment</b> <b>policies</b> and training policies appear to be complementary rather than substitutes. This means that within the various occupational fields, continuing training increases the skill gap between highly skilled and intermediately skilled workers. Moreover, both intermediate and highly skilled workers participate significantly more in continuing training than low skilled workers. This again indicates an increase in the skill gap in the labour force in the EU Member States, which means that continuing training fails to achieve the upgrading of low skilled workers which is required if the labour supply is to be adjusted to transfer human resources towards activities which match the EU's comparative advantages. ...|$|R

Consequently, the decision was made to disband or amalgamate a number of units, with each brigade within the 3rd Division being reduced from four infantry battalions to three.

2500|$|Norton-Griffiths {{ensured that}} {{tunnelling}} companies numbers 170 to 177 {{were ready for}} deployment in mid-February 1915. In the spring of that year, there was constant underground fighting in the Ypres Salient at Hooge, Hill 60, Railway Wood, Sanctuary Wood, St Eloi and The Bluff which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after {{the formation of the}} first eight companies. The lack of suitably experienced men led to some tunnelling companies starting work later than others. The number of units available to the BEF was also restricted by the need to provide effective counter-measures to the German mining activities. To make the tunnels safer and quicker to deploy, the British Army enlisted experienced coal miners, many outside their nominal <b>recruitment</b> <b>policy.</b> The first nine companies, numbers 170 to 178, were each commanded by a regular Royal Engineers officer. These companies each comprised 5 officers and 269 sappers; they were aided by additional infantrymen who were temporarily attached to the tunnellers as required, which almost doubled their numbers. The success of the first tunnelling companies formed under Norton-Griffiths' command led to mining being made a separate branch of the [...] Engineer-in-Chief's office under Major-General S.R. Rice, and the appointment of an 'Inspector of Mines' at the GHQ Saint-Omer office of the Engineer-in-Chief. A second group of tunnelling companies were formed from Welsh miners from the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Monmouthshire Regiment, who were attached to the 1st Northumberland Field Company of the Royal Engineers, which was a Territorial unit. The formation of twelve new tunnelling companies, between July and October 1915, helped to bring more men into action {{in other parts of the}} Western Front.
