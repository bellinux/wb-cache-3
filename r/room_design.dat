2500|$|A {{contestant}} who {{encountered a}} temple guard {{was forced to}} give up a full pendant in order to continue. However, if the first contestant was caught without a pendant in his or her possession, he or she was taken out of the temple and the second contestant entered. In either case, the temple guard who captures the contestant was out of play, and did not appear again in that room where the first contestant was captured. When the second contestant entered, any doors that the first contestant opened remained open. If the second contestant was caught without a full pendant, the run ended immediately. It was possible for a player to enter a room with an unencountered temple guard {{on their way to the}} artifact and not get caught, usually if the <b>room</b> <b>design</b> makes it so that the guard can only capture the player if within reach (e.g. the Dark Forest where one of the trees [...] "could be inhabited by the spirit of a temple guard" [...] which was signaled if the tree grabbed the player, but the player had to be within reach to trigger the tree).|$|E
