50|$|In any full-function IMS database, the {{smallest}} element {{that can be}} retrieved is a segment. Each segment {{is made up of}} fields, one of which, typically, will be a key field. The segments are arranged hierarchically in the database, the highest level segment type being a <b>root</b> <b>segment.</b> 255 different segment types, on up to 15 levels, are allowed in any database. A database record consists of a specific <b>root</b> <b>segment</b> and all its dependent child segments there is no limit to the number of segments in a record, or to the number of records in a database (apart from physical limitations of storage space).|$|E
50|$|The IMS Database {{component}} stores data using {{a hierarchical}} model, {{which is quite}} different from IBM's later released relational database, DB2. In IMS, the hierarchical model is implemented using blocks of data known as segments. Each segment can contain several pieces of data, which are called fields. For example, a customer database may have a <b>root</b> <b>segment</b> (or the segment {{at the top of the}} hierarchy) with fields such as phone, name, and age. Child segments may be added underneath another segment, for instance, one order segment under each customer segment representing each order a customer has placed with a company. Likewise, each order segment may have many children segments for each item on the order. Unlike other databases, you do not need to define all of the data in a segment to IMS. A segment may be defined with a size of 40 bytes but only define one field that is six bytes long as a key field that you can use to find the segment when performing queries. IMS will retrieve and save all 40 bytes as directed by a program but may not understand (or care) what the other bytes represent. In practice, often all data in a segment may map to a COBOL copybook. Besides DL/I query usage, a field may be defined in IMS so that the data can be hidden from certain applications for security reasons. The database component of IMS can be purchased standalone, without the transaction manager component, and used by systems such as CICS.|$|E
40|$|Root {{fractures}} {{in the middle}} and apical thirds of the root are treated by repositioning and for approximately 6 weeks of immobilization while those in the cervical third are immobilized for 3 months. Even though the results are good, some root-fractured teeth are lost and replaced by dental implants or fixed partial dentures. One historic but effective treatment option for those root fractures with unfavorable crown to root ratios is an endodontic implant in middle and apical third root fractures. This method offers immediate stable fixation of a crown and its coronal <b>root</b> <b>segment</b> to the underlying alveolar bone. This report documents the long-term survival of a tooth treated with an endodontic implant. A 25 -year-old male patient presented following a bicycle accident with a dislocated unfavorable root fracture in the middle third. The crown with the coronal <b>root</b> <b>segment</b> was secured to the bone using a commercially available endodontic implant. The apical part of the root was removed. Although the clinical and radiological follow-up results of the endodontic implant demonstrated a good clinical function and little bone loss, the implant ultimately had to be removed after 22 years of service due to pain and increasing mobility...|$|E

Callus and roots were formed on all <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> after an approximately 2 week growth period; buds were formed after ca. 4 weeks only on segments adjacent to the hypocotyl. Higher concentrations of auxin and cytokinins were required for bud induction. Cultivar differences in the morphogenetic responses of the <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> were found.

In freshly excised <b>root</b> <b>segments,</b> NADH had no effect on O 2 consumption and K+ uptake. However, after the <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> were given a 4 -hour wash in aerated salt solution, NADH elicited a moderate stimulation in O 2 consumption but caused a dramatic inhibition of K+ influx.

40|$|Minirhizotrons {{provide a}} unique way to {{repeatedly}} measure the production and fate of individual root segments, while minimizing soil disturbance and the confounding of spatial–temporal variation. However, the time associated with processing videotaped minirhizotron images limits the amount of data that can be extracted in {{a reasonable amount of}} time. We found that this limitation can be minimized using a more easily measured variable r (i. e. root numbers) as a substitute of root length. Linear regression models were fitted between root length versus root number for production and mortality of seven sample datasets of varying tree species and treatments. The resulting r 2 values ranged from 0. 79 to 0. 99, suggesting that changes in root numbers can be used to predict root length dynamics reliably. Slope values, representing the mean <b>root</b> <b>segment</b> length (MRSL), ranged from 2. 34 to 8. 38 mm per <b>root</b> <b>segment</b> for both production and mortality. Most treatments did not alter MRSL substantially, the exceptions being CO 2 treatments and a girdling treatment that altered plant community composition and, consequently, root morphology. The high r 2 values demonstrated a robust relationship between variables irrespective of species or treatments. Once the quantitative relationship between root lengths and numbers has been established for a particular species–treatment combination, quantifying changes in root number through time should substantially decrease the time required to quantify root dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Morphactin in a {{concentration}} of 100 ppm does not retard pea root growth, however, it reduced the frequency of cell division and shifted the main wave of mitoses in the 24 h period from 1 to 2 mm of <b>root</b> <b>segment.</b> The mean cell cycle duration is prolonged from 14 h in the control to 22 h in morphactin-treated roots. In the presence of morphactin the decrease of 3 H-thymidine incorporation and diminution of labelling index is accompanied by reduction of the nuclear surface area. The described changes are not accompanied by shortening of cell length. The results obtained suggest that morphactin disturbs the mechanisms regulating the initiation of S phase and its regular course. Moreover, it inhibits the endomitotic replication of DNA...|$|E
40|$|Ethylene {{production}} was measured from excised 10 -mm apical and subapical <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> from 50 cultivars in 19 species of 7 families.

Ethylene {{production was}} generally higher in apical <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> than in subapical segments within 1 h of wounding. However, cultivars of Cucumis melo, C. sativus, Helianthus annuus, Hibiscus esculentus, and Zea mays had higher rates of ethylene production from subapical <b>segments.</b> In apical <b>root</b> <b>segments,</b> Phaseolus aureus cv.

Catalase quenched chemiluminescence in wounded <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> as did ascorbic acid and hydroquinone. Superoxide dismutase addition resulted in a small diminution in light emission, but mannitol, an OH· scavenger, was without effect. The addition of H 2 O 2 to wounded <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> markedly elevated chemiluminescence {{in the presence of}} air as well as under N 2.

40|$|Callus {{induction}} {{and later}} plant regeneration were studied in four widely grown garlic (Allium sativum L.) cultivars from Europe. <b>Root</b> <b>segments</b> from in vitro plantlets {{were used as}} starting material. In addition to cultivar effects, the effects of auxin and cytokinin levels and {{the position of the}} <b>segments</b> on the <b>root</b> were studied. There were no statistically significant differences among cultivars for the number of <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> that induced callus in the two series of experiments. The average induction frequency was 34. 7 % in the first series of experiments. Callus induction on apical <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> was significantly higher compared to callus induction on non-apical <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> in the second series of experiments. Two months after callus induction, callus lines were transferred to a regeneration medium consisting of Murashige and Skoog basal medium supplemented with 30 g l- 1 sucrose and 1 mg l- 1 (4. 6 M) kinetin. Calluses derived from different experiments were quite uniform with respect to their regeneration potential. Also it was found that our regeneration system was cultivar-independent. The average shoot regeneration frequency was 17. 9 % in the first series of experiments. Highly significant differences were found in the frequency of shoot regeneration among different callus induction treatments. When the cytokinin 6 -(,-dimethylallylamino) purine (0. 1 mg l- 1 : 0. 5 M) was present during callus induction, shoot regeneration ranged from 30. 10 to 47. 60 %. Shoot regeneration from callus induced on non-apical segments was higher, although not significant, compared to callus induction from apical <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> in the second series of experiments. All in all, an efficient callus induction and plant regeneration system was developed from both apical and non-apical segments taken along {{the entire length of the}} roots.

The hydraulic anatomy model accurately predicts empirical root radial permeability (kr) from relatively high cell wall hydraulic conductivity and low plasmodesmatal conductance reported in the literature. MECHA brings novel insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature by quantifying the impact of intercellular spaces, cortical cell permeability and plasmodesmata among others on root kr, and suggests new experiments efficiently addressing questions of root water relations...|$|E

40|$|The rapid uptake of weak acids {{permeant}} in the uncharged form {{is accompanied}} in maize and wheat <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> by a hyperpolarization of the {{transmembrane electrical potential}} {{and an increase in}} K+ uptake, suggesting a stimulation of the plasmalemma H+ pump. The evaluation of weak acid-induced H+ extrusion must take into account the alkalinization of the medium due to the rapid uptake of the uncharged form of the acid, partially masking the proton pump-mediated extrusion of H+. The data corrected for this interference show that the lipophilic butyric acid and trimethyl acetic acid induce in maize and in wheat <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> a significant increase in `real' H+ extrusion, roughly matching the increase in net K+ uptake. The presence of K+ significantly increases the rate of uptake of the weak acid, possibly as a consequence of an alkalinization of the cytosol associated with K+ absorption. In maize <b>root</b> <b>segments,</b> the effects of fusicoccin and those of butyric acid on both K+ uptake and H+ extrusion are clearly synergistic, thus suggesting distinct modes of action. These results support the view that the activity of the plasmalemma H+ pump is regulated by the value of cytosolic pH...|$|R

Fresh (moist) and dried <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> as well as ground roots were analyzed by FT MIR-ATR spectroscopy. Root absorption spectra showed species specific peak distribution and peak height. A clear separation according to species was not possible with fresh <b>root</b> <b>segments.</b> Dried <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> (including <b>root</b> basis, middle section and root tip) of maize/barnyard grass and sugar beet/common lambsquarters formed completely separated species clusters. Wheat and blackgrass separated in species specific clusters when root tips were removed from cluster analysis. A clear separation of dried <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> according to species was not possible {{in the case of}} barley and wild oat. Cluster analyses of ground roots revealed a 100 % separation of all tested crop and weed species combinations. Spectra grouped in Poaceae and Chenopodiaceae clusters. Within the Poaceae cluster, C 3 and C 4 species differed significantly in heterogeneity. Thus, root spectra reflected the degree of kinship. To quantify species proportion in root mixtures, a two- and a three-species model for species quantification in root mixtures of maize, barnyard grass, and wild oat was calculated. The models showed low standard errors of prediction (RMSEP) and high residual predictive deviation (RPD) values in an external test set validation.

Arabinose, xylose, glucose, sucrose, mannitol, and sorbitol caused no inhibition. When galactose was removed after a 1 -hour treatment, the elongation was partially recovered. Cycloheximide and 2 -deoxyglucose suppressed acid-enhanced elongation when these were applied {{at the same time as}} acid treatments, whereas cordycepin (3 ′-deoxyadenosine) inhibited elongation only if it was applied prior to acid treatment. Over the 9 -hour period of elongation studied, the inhibition by galactose was comparable to that of cycloheximide. Since galactose has been reported to suppress the sugar metabolism necessary for the cell wall synthesis, the later phase of acid-enhanced elongation of <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> may at least partially depend on the synthesis or metabolism of cell wall components. The inhibition of root growth by galactose may be partially ascribed to a direct effect on the elongation process in roots, an effect that is enhanced by the acidification of the cell walls...|$|R

The terminal 0 - to 1 -millimeter root tip contained 43 to 44 times more free cytokinin on a fresh weight or a per cell basis than the next 1 - to 5 -millimeter <b>root</b> <b>segment.</b> Extracts of more proximal segments behind the tip contained no measurable free cytokinin. Acid hydrolysates of transfer RNA exhibited reproducible cytokinin activity. Bioassays revealed that the predominant amounts of free cytokinin and that present in transfer RNA were restricted to the extreme root tip. There was approximately 27 times more free cytokinin than the amount detected in transfer RNA in root apices...|$|E
40|$|Background and aimsThe use of {{standard}} dynamic root architecture models to simulate root growth in soil containing macropores failed to reproduce experimentally observed root growth patterns. We thus developed a new, more mechanistic model approach for the simulation of root growth in structured soil. MethodsIn our alternative modelling approach, we distinguish between, firstly, {{the driving force}} for root growth, which {{is determined by the}} orientation of the previous <b>root</b> <b>segment</b> and the influence of gravitropism and, secondly, soil mechanical resistance to root growth. The latter is expressed by its inverse, soil mechanical conductance, and treated similarly to hydraulic conductivity in Darcy’s law. At the presence of macropores, soil mechanical conductance is anisotropic, which leads to a difference between the direction of the driving force and the direction of the root tip movement. ResultsThe model was tested using data from the literature, at pot scale, at macropore scale, and in a series of simulations where sensitivity to gravity and macropore orientation was evaluated. ConclusionsQualitative and quantitative comparisons between simulated and experimentally observed root systems showed good agreement, suggesting that the drawn analogy between soil water flow and root growth is a useful one...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAimTo {{evaluate}} the fracture resistance of endodontically treated roots using different root canal preparation/obturation combinations including ProTaper, RaCe and hand preparation systems combined with Soft-Core/AH 26, RealSeal and EndoREZ obturators. Materials and methods 120 recently extracted maxillary central incisors were selected. The coronal portions of all teeth were removed near the cemento-enamel junction leaving the <b>root</b> <b>segment</b> of nearly 16  ±  1  mm length. Roots were randomly divided into 3 groups (n =  40) {{according to the}} system used in root canal preparations, Group I: ProTaper, Group II: RaCe and Group III: Hand instrumentation. Each main group was further subdivided into 4 equal subgroups according to the obturation system being used, Subgroup A: Soft-Core/AH 26 obturator, Subgroup B: RealSeal system, Subgroup C: EndoREZ system and Subgroup D: in which roots were left unobturated as control subgroup. Fracture resistance of each sample was measured by loading in universal testing machine. The force was applied at a crosshead speed of 1  mm/min until fracture occurs and this force was recorded in Newton. ResultsNo significant difference among the obturation systems was recorded however a significant difference with the control subgroup (ID) prepared with ProTaper was obvious...|$|E

40|$|Segments of oat (Avena sativa L.) roots {{which had}} been exposed to 1 millimolar CdSO 4 in quarter-strength Hoagland No. 1 {{solution}} exhibited decreased respiratory rates, ATP levels, membrane-bound ATPase activity, and reduced K+ fluxes. Respiration and ATP levels were decreased after a 2 -hour treatment with 1 millimolar CdSO 4 to 65 and 75 %, respectively, of control rates. A membrane-bound, Mg 2 +-dependent, K+-stimulated acid ATPase was rapidly inhibited to 12 % of control activity in the presence of 1 millimolar CdSO 4. Potassium uptake into <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> was inhibited to 80 % of control values after 30 minutes in the presence of CdSO 4. A 2 -hour pretreatment of <b>root</b> <b>segments</b> with CdSO 4 inhibited K+ uptake to 15 % of control values. Cytoplasmic K+ efflux was inhibited with 1 millimolar CdSO 4...|$|R
40|$|In dynamic root {{architecture}} models, root {{growth is}} represented by moving root tips whose line trajectory results {{in the creation of}} new <b>root</b> <b>segments.</b> Typically, the direction of root growth is calculated as the vector sum of various direction-affecting components.
