40|$|Early {{exposure}} to hypertonic solution strongly intensifies {{the effects of}} K + channel opener, <b>rilmakalim,</b> in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. I. KOCIÆ, Y. HIRANO, M. HI-RAOKA. Pol. J. Pharmacol., 2003, 55, 1159 – 1162. We report here that early exposure of guinea pig ventricular myocytes to hypertonic solution (~ 400 mOsm compared to 280 mOsm in isotonic solution) increased the potency of <b>rilmakalim</b> to evoke ATP-sensitive K + current 10 times (pD 2 = 7. 44 ± 0. 11 compared to pD 2 = 6. 49 ± 0. 18 in isotonic solution) without changing Emax, and observed effect was completely reversed by glibenclamide at 1 �M.

40|$|The {{full-length}} cDNAs of {{two different}} α-subunits (Kir 6. 1 and Kir 6. 2) and partial cDNAs of three different β-subunits (SUR 1, SUR 2 A and SUR 2 B) of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels of the guinea-pig (gp) were obtained by screening a cDNA library from the ventricle of guinea-pig heart. Cell-specific reverse-transcriptase PCR with gene-specific intron-spanning primers showed that gpKir 6. 1, gpKir 6. 2 and gpSUR 2 B were expressed in a purified fraction of capillary endothelial cells. In cardiomyocytes, gpKir 6. 1, gpKir 6. 2, gpSUR 1 and gpSUR 2 A were detected. Patch-clamp measurements were carried out in isolated capillary fragments consisting of 3 – 15 endothelial cells. The membrane capacitance measured in the whole-cell mode was 19. 9 ± 1. 0 pF and was independent {{of the length of}} the capillary fragment, which suggests that the endothelial cells were not electrically coupled under our experimental conditions. The perforated-patch technique was used to measure the steady-state current-voltage relation of capillary endothelial cells. Application of K+ channel openers (<b>rilmakalim</b> or diazoxide) or metabolic inhibition (250 μm 2, 4 -dinitrophenol plus 10 mM deoxyglucose) induced a current that reversed near the calculated K+ equilibrium potential. <b>Rilmakalim</b> (1 μm), diazoxide (300 μm) and metabolic inhibition increased the slope conductance measured at − 55 mV by a factor of 9. 0 (± 1. 8), 2. 5 (± 0. 2) and 3. 9 (± 1. 7), respectively. The effects were reversed by glibenclamide (1 μm). Our results suggest that capillary endothelial cells from guinea-pig heart express KATP channels composed of SUR 2 B and Kir 6. 1 and/or Kir 6. 2 subunits. The hyperpolarization elicited by the opening of KATP channels may lead to an increase in free cytosolic Ca 2 +, and thus modulate the synthesis of NO and the permeability of the capillary wall...|$|E
40|$|The {{sulfonylurea}} receptor (SUR) is {{the important}} reg-ulatory subunit of ATP-sensitive K channels. It is an ATP-binding cassette protein comprising 17 transmem-brane helices. SUR is endowed with binding sites for channel blockers like the antidiabetic sulfonylurea glib-enclamide and for the chemically very heterogeneous channel openers. SUR 1, the typical pancreatic SUR iso-form, shows much higher affinity for glibenclamide but considerably lower affinity for most openers than SUR 2. In radioligand binding assays, we investigated the role of two amino acids, T 1285 and M 1289, located in trans-membrane helix (TM) - 17, in opener binding to SUR 1. These amino acids were exchanged for the correspond-ing amino acids of SUR 2. In competition experiments using [3 H]glibenclamide as radioligand, SUR 1 (T 1285 L, M 1289 T) showed much higher affinity toward the cya-noguanidine openers pinacidil and P 1075 than SUR 1 wild type. The affinity for the thioformamide aprikalim was also markedly increased. In contrast, the affinity for the benzopyrans <b>rilmakalim</b> and levcromakalim was unaffected; however, the amount of displaced [3 H] glibenclamide binding was nearly doubled. The binding properties of the opener diazoxide and the blocker glibenclamide were unchanged. In conclusion, mutation of two amino acids in TM 17 of SUR 1, especially of M 1289, leads to class-specific effects on opener binding by increasing opener affinity or by changing allosteric coupling between opener and glibenclamide binding...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the acute desensitization of acetylcholine-activated GIRK current (IK(ACh)) in cultured adult rat atrial myocytes. Acute desensitization of IK(ACh) is observed as a partial relaxation of current with a half-time of 2 μmol l− 1) of ACh. Under this condition experimental manoeuvres that cause {{a decrease in the}} amplitude of IK(ACh), such as partial block of M 2 receptors by atropine, intracellular loading with GDP-β-S, or exposure to Ba 2 +, caused a reduction in desensitization. Acute desensitization was also identified as a decrease in current amplitude and a blunting of the response to saturating [ACh] (20 μmol l− 1) when the current had been partially activated by a low concentration of ACh or by stimulation of adenosine A 1 receptors. A reduction in current analogous to acute desensitization was observed when ATP-dependent K+ current (IK(ATP)) was activated either by mitochondrial uncoupling using 2, 4 -dinitrophenole (DNP) or by the channel opener <b>rilmakalim.</b> Adenovirus-driven overexpression of Kir 2. 1, a subunit of constitutively active inwardly rectifying K+ channels, resulted in a large Ba 2 +-sensitive background K+ current and a dramatic reduction of ACh-activated current. Adenovirus-driven overexpression of GIRK 4 (Kir 3. 4) subunits resulted in an increased agonist-independent GIRK current paralleled by a reduction in IK(ACh) and removal of the desensitizing component. These data indicate that acute desensitization depends on K+ current flow, independent of the K+ channel species, suggesting that it reflects a reduction in electrochemical driving force rather than a bona fide signalling mechanism. This is supported by the observation that desensitization is paralleled by a significant negative shift in reversal potential of IK(ACh). Since the ACh-induced hyperpolarization shows comparable desensitization properties as IK(ACh), this novel current-dependent desensitization is a physiologically relevant process, shaping the time course of parasympathetic bradycardia...|$|E
