40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} severe and fatal crashes {{that result from}} {{vehicles}} colliding with street <b>columns</b> such as <b>lighting</b> <b>columns.</b> These cause extremely high impact forces and deformation on the frontal area of the car. The objective {{of the study is}} to demonstrate the frontal crash simulation of vehicle against <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> to examine injury risk and potential of safety. In particular, various FE models are used to perform contact–impact nonlinear dynamic analysis of <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> with vehicle. In this paper Abaqus explicit code is used to numerically simulate the crash of the vehicle with present <b>columns</b> and other <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> fabricated from a new suggested material. The acceleration, contact force and deformed energy at the frontal region of the vehicle are traced.

40|$|It is {{observed}} that the power consumption of <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is increased with the length of trafficable road in Hong Kong. The energy used in <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is increasing, {{which means that the}} greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted from power plant for generating electricity for <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> {{is at the same time}} increasing. To compare the performance of light emitted diode (LED) <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> with <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> of other lamp sources, literature review, life cycle assessment (LCA) and technical assessment are adopted to give an overall comparison. This research focuses more on the environmental impacts of <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> LCA is adopted in order to give a comprehensive view on the environmental impact of <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> A total of 3 different lamp sources are compared: high pressure sodium (HPS) lamp, induction lamp and light emitted diode (LED) lamp. From the model result, it is found that due to the low power consumption and long life time, LED and induction lamp <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> gives generally less environmental impact than HPS <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> As induction lamp has a longer life span than LED, the environmental impact of induction lamp <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is found slightly less than that of LED <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> Taking account the future development in LED technology, leading to longer life time, higher efficacy and lower production cost, LED <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is expected to be a replacement for <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> in Hong Kong for the future. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} performance of consumer products {{is a major}} concern for many companies. In this work, an attributional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study was performed to identify the Best Practicable Environmental Option of three <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> made in alternative materials.

Analysis of an alternative composite <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> with the same matrix, but reinforced with natural fibres (jute) was also performed. The results showed that the <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> made of steel has the worst overall environmental profile, although steel production is less energy intensive. The composite <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> is environmentally preferable due to its extended lifespan and lack of maintenance. The production of the raw material is responsible for most of the impacts in all three cases. The glass fibre production is the main contributor for the overall environmental burden of the composite column.

30|$|However, {{vehicle speed}} {{decreased}} due to bad weather conditions (rain and snow) and the decrease was substantially higher on <b>roads</b> without <b>lighting</b> than on <b>roads</b> with <b>lighting.</b> Our results therefore suggests that when <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is present, drivers respond less strongly to worsened weather conditions, especially during darkness. This indicates that <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> may indeed induce higher vehicle speed, but mainly in special circumstances such as “bad” weather conditions. The presence of <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> may therefore influence driving behavior so that drivers do not adapt adequately or {{as well to}} the prevailing weather conditions as they might if <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> were not present. Although the correlation reported between the presence of <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> and fewer accidents (e.g., Jackett and Frith 2013) {{would suggest that the}} higher visibility in general may compensate for the higher vehicle speed also in worsened weather conditions.

40|$|The work {{starts with}} a short {{introduction}} concerning the history of <b>road</b> <b>lighting,</b> outlining the trends and changes {{that have taken place}} in <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> research during the past century. The introduction is followed by a review of trends, directions, and problems in current <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> research and practice. The following part of the work introduces an advanced approach to <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> measurements and calculations, based on the use of an imaging luminance photometer and the Road LumiMeter v 2. 0 computer program. The work sets out to investigate the variations in the characteristics {{of the quality of the}} <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> at the same pilot locations in relation to the calculation methods used. In the work mesopic visual performance and the effects of the spectral transmittance of the vehicle windshield on the visibility conditions of the driver are also analysed. The work continues with <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> measurements in various weather conditions in order to study the effects of snowy and wet road surface conditions on <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> luminances. The results show that in Finland, snowy conditions offer very good opportunities to save electricity without adversely affecting either the safety of driving or the quality of <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> The following measurements set out to investigate the contribution of halogen and high-intensity discharge headlights to <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> and whether this has a conflicting effect on the luminance contrasts of various targets located on the road or at the side of the road. The results indicate that, in general, the use of vehicle headlights in the presence of <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> reduces the luminance contrasts of targets. The work continues with <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> visibility experiments which study the visibility of achromatic and coloured targets in MH lamp and HPS lamp installations. The results show that colours have a major effect on target visibility if the road is illuminated with a light source with adequate colour rendering properties.

40|$|In 2004, the Swedish Road Administration and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities {{published}} a handbook, VGU, {{on the design}} of roads and streets, in which one of the sections deals with <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> The main thought in the VGU is to reallocate means for <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> from <b>roads</b> where the benefit for traffic safety is low, to roads where it is high. Consequently, good <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is primarily recommended on roads and streets where unprotected road-users, such as cyclists and pedestrians, pass. The aim of this project was to analyse the effect of reduced or turned off <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> on motorways, considering road-user behaviour and attitudes. The intention was to use two existing motorway stretches for the trial, both with a large part of commuter traffic. On one road stretch, the existing <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> should be reduced by half, while it should be completely turned off at the other. Interviews with commuters should be carried out after the lighting reduction, and speed measurements should be made before and after the reduction. Because of the strong negative reaction from one person living close to the road stretch where the <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> was completely turned off and that this person contacted media, it was necessary to turn on the <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> again. As a result of this, no attitude study could be accomplished, and no measurements of speed after the reduction on this road stretch were possible. Accordingly, it was only possible to make speed measurements on the motorway stretch where the <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> had been reduced by 50 per cent...|$|R

30|$|In this study, {{we assumed}} that {{daylight}} or <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> would represent brighter driving conditions (higher luminance) and would therefore be associated with higher vehicle speed as stated in hypothesis I. Across all measurements, we found that vehicle speed was higher during daylight than in darkness in clear weather conditions when <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> was present, confirming the hypothesis. However, we found the opposite for <b>roads</b> without <b>road</b> <b>lighting,</b> where the average vehicle speed was higher in darkness than in daylight.|$|R
30|$|The {{effects of}} light {{conditions}} {{seemed to be}} dependent upon weather conditions, confirming hypothesis III. While in general speeds were higher in darkness and the twilight than in daylight for roads with and without <b>road</b> <b>lighting,</b> during snow on unlit roads speeds were much lower in darkness and lower at twilight than in daylight. On <b>roads</b> with <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> {{there was still a}} slight speed increase in darkness compared with daylight even during snow, but it was much smaller than during clear weather conditions. Thus the effect of light conditions seemed to vary depending on weather conditions. The effects of <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> seemed to be stable, however, and <b>roads</b> without <b>lighting</b> had larger decreases in speed than the <b>roads</b> with <b>lighting</b> in all weather conditions.|$|R
