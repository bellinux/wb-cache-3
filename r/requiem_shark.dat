5|$|The {{oceanic whitetip shark}} (Carcharhinus longimanus), {{also known}} as Brown Milbert's sand bar shark, brown shark, nigano shark, oceanic white-tipped whaler, and silvertip shark, is a large pelagic <b>requiem</b> <b>shark</b> inhabiting {{tropical}} and warm temperate seas. Its stocky body is most notable for its long, white-tipped, rounded fins.|$|E
5|$|The hardnose shark (Carcharhinus macloti) is {{a species}} of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> in the family Carcharhinidae, so named because of the heavily calcified cartilages in its snout. A small bronze-coloured shark {{reaching}} a length of , it has a slender body and a long, pointed snout. Its two modestly sized dorsal fins have distinctively elongated rear tips. The hardnose shark is widely distributed in the western Indo-Pacific, from Kenya to southern China and northern Australia. It inhabits warm, shallow waters close to shore.|$|E
5|$|The Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezii) is {{a species}} of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> {{belonging}} to the family Carcharhinidae. It {{is found in the}} tropical waters of the western Atlantic Ocean from Florida to Brazil, and is the most commonly encountered reef shark in the Caribbean Sea. With a robust, streamlined body typical of the requiem sharks, this species is difficult to tell apart from other large members of its family such as the dusky shark (C. obscurus) and the silky shark (C. falciformis). Distinguishing characteristics include dusky-colored fins without prominent markings, a short free rear tip on the second dorsal fin, and tooth shape and number.|$|E

5|$|One {{problem with}} {{counting}} attacks on humans {{is that the}} copper shark is so similar to other <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks.</b> Victims and witnesses are unlikely to correctly identify which type of genus Carcharhinus shark {{is responsible for the}} attack. Experts trying to confirm shark attacks by species warn that their statistics undercount the number of attacks by <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks</b> like the copper.|$|R
50|$|Rhizoprionodon is a genus of <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{and part}} of the family Carcharhinidae, {{commonly}} known as sharpnose sharks because of their long, pointed snouts.|$|R
5|$|The Pondicherry shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is an {{extremely}} rare species of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> in the family Carcharhinidae. A small and stocky gray shark, it grows not much longer than , {{and it has a}} fairly long, pointed snout. This species can be identified by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly serrated near the base and smooth-edged near the tip, and by its first dorsal fin, which is large with a long free rear tip. Furthermore, this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins, second dorsal fin, and caudal fin lower lobe.|$|E
5|$|The finetooth shark (Carcharhinus isodon) is {{a species}} of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> in the family Carcharhinidae, found in the western Atlantic Ocean, from North Carolina to Brazil. It forms large schools in shallow, coastal waters, and migrates {{seasonally}} following warm water. A relatively small, slender-bodied shark, the finetooth shark can be identified by its needle-like teeth, dark blue-gray dorsal coloration, and long gill slits. It attains a maximum length of 1.9m (6.2ft). The diet of this species consists primarily of small bony fishes, in particular menhaden. Like other members of its family, it is viviparous with females giving birth to two to six pups in estuarine nursery areas every other year.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in morphology, tooth shape, and behavior, the closest {{relatives of the}} spinner shark were originally {{believed to be the}} blacktip shark and the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides). However, this interpretation was not supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis, which suggested that these similarities are the product of convergent evolution and that the closest relative of the spinner shark is the copper shark (C. brachyurus). In a 2007 ribosomal DNA study, the spinner shark was found to be the most genetically divergent of all the <b>requiem</b> <b>shark</b> species examined save for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), being less related to other Carcharhinus species than the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
50|$|Galeocerdo is a genus of <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks</b> {{that have}} lived since the Eocene epoch. While {{formerly}} diverse, only Galeocerdo cuvier (the modern tiger shark) survives today.|$|R
50|$|<b>Requiem</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{responsible}} for {{a large proportion of}} attacks on humans; however, due to the difficulty in identifying individual species, a degree of inaccuracy exists in attack records.|$|R
50|$|Predators of dories include large sharks {{such as the}} {{dusky shark}} (Carcharhinus obscurus) and other <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> and larger shelf- and slope-dwelling bony fish, such as predatory Moehau, and merluccid hakes.|$|R
5|$|The {{dusky shark}} (Carcharhinus obscurus) is {{a species of}} <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> in the family Carcharhinidae, {{occurring}} in tropical and warm-temperate continental seas worldwide. A generalist apex predator, the dusky shark can be found from the coast to the outer continental shelf and adjacent pelagic waters, and has been recorded from a depth of 400 m (1,300ft). Populations migrate seasonally towards the poles {{in the summer and}} towards the equator in the winter, traveling hundreds to thousands of kilometers. One of the largest members of its genus, the dusky shark reaches 4.2m (14ft) in length and 347kg (765lb) in weight. It has a slender, streamlined body and can be identified by its short round snout, long sickle-shaped pectoral fins, ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins, and faintly marked fins.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} view of hammerhead shark {{evolution is}} that species with smaller cephalofoils evolved first from a <b>requiem</b> <b>shark</b> ancestor, and later {{gave rise to}} species with larger cephalofoils. Under this interpretation, the winghead shark is the most derived hammerhead, as it has the most extreme cephalofoil morphology. However, molecular phylogenetic research based on isozymes, mitochondrial DNA, and nuclear DNA have found the opposite pattern, with the winghead shark as the most basal member of the hammerhead family. This result supports the counterintuitive idea that the first hammerhead shark to evolve had a large cephalofoil. It also supports the separation of Eusphyra from Sphyrna by keeping the latter monophyletic (including all descendants of a single ancestor). The winghead shark lineage is estimated to have diverged {{from the rest of}} the hammerheads some 15â€“20 million years ago during the Miocene.|$|E
25|$|Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific are {{dominated}} by whitetip, blacktip and grey reef shark. Coral reefs in the western Atlantic Ocean {{are dominated}} by the Caribbean reef shark. These sharks are all species of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> and all have the robust, streamlined bodies that are typical of the <b>requiem</b> <b>shark.</b> They are fast-swimming, agile predators that feed primarily on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Other species of reef sharks include the Galapagos shark, the tawny nurse shark and hammerheads.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{ovoviviparous}} {{fish are}} many of the squaliform sharks, which include sand sharks, mackerel <b>sharks,</b> nurse <b>sharks,</b> <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> dog sharks and hammerheads, among others, and the lobe finned coelacanth. Some species of rockfish (Sebastes) and sculpins (Comephoridae) produce rather weak larvae with no egg membrane and are also, by definition, ovoviviparous. Ovoviviparity occurs in most live-bearing bony fishes (Poeciliidae).|$|R
50|$|Carcharhinus is {{the type}} genus of the family Carcharhinidae, the <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks.</b> One of 12 genera in its family, it {{contains}} {{over half of the}} species therein. It contains 35 species to date, with likely more species yet to be described.|$|R
50|$|<b>Requiem</b> <b>sharks</b> are sharks of {{the family}} Carcharhinidae in the order Carcharhiniformes, {{containing}} migratory, live-bearing sharks of warm seas (sometimes of brackish or fresh water) such as the spinner shark, the blacknose shark, the blacktip shark, the blacktail reef shark, and the blacktip reef shark.|$|R
25|$|The {{bull shark}} (Carcharhinus leucas), {{also known as}} the Zambezi shark or, unofficially, as Zambi in Africa and Lake Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a <b>requiem</b> <b>shark</b> {{commonly}} found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. The bull shark is known for its aggressive nature, predilection for warm shallow water, and presence in brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and rivers.|$|E
25|$|The spadenose shark (Scoliodon laticaudus) is {{a species}} of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> {{and part of the}} family Carcharhinidae. It is common in the {{tropical}} Indian and western Pacific Oceans, where it forms large schools in shallow water. A small shark reaching a length of , the spadenose shark is named for its distinctively flattened, triangular snout. It is a predator of small bony fishes and invertebrates. This species exhibits the most advanced mode of viviparity of any fish, in which the developed embryos form a highly complex placental connection to the mother at a very small size. Females breed year-round, giving birth to six to 18 pups after a gestation period of five to six months. The spadenose shark is harmless to humans and is valued by artisanal and commercial fishers for its meat and fins. Its abundance ensures it forms a significant component of many fisheries in South and Southeast Asia. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E
25|$|Sharks inhabit all {{the coastal}} waters and estuarine {{habitats}} of Australia's coast. There are 166 species, including 30 species of <b>requiem</b> <b>shark,</b> 32 of catshark, six of wobbegong shark, and 40 of dogfish shark. There are three species {{from the family}} Heterodontidae: the Port Jackson shark, the zebra bullhead shark and the crested bullhead shark. In 2004, there were 12 unprovoked shark attacks in Australia, of which two were fatal. Only 3 species of shark pose a significant threat to humans: the bull shark, the tiger shark and the great white shark. Some popular beaches in Queensland and New South Wales are protected by shark netting, a method that has reduced the population of both dangerous and harmless shark species through accidental entanglement. The overfishing of sharks has also significantly reduced shark numbers in Australian waters, and several species are now endangered. A megamouth shark was found on a Perth beach in 1988; very {{little is known about}} this species, but this discovery may indicate the presence of the species in Australian coastal waters.|$|E
25|$|The small {{teeth of}} the Irrawaddy river shark {{suggests}} that it mainly preys on fish, while its small eyes {{are consistent with the}} extremely turbid water in which it hunts. Reproduction is presumably viviparous, with the young sustained by a placental connection, as in other <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{in other}} <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks,</b> the blacknose shark is viviparous: after the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the empty yolk sac develops into a placental connection {{through which the}} mother provides nourishment. Off the United States, males are thought to reproduce every year, while females reproduce every other year.|$|R
5|$|Finally some sharks {{maintain}} a placental {{link to the}} developing young, this method is called viviparity. This is more analogous to mammalian gestation than that of other fishes. The young are born alive and fully functional. Hammerheads, the <b>requiem</b> <b>sharks</b> (such as the bull and blue sharks), and smoothhounds are viviparous.|$|R
25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is an {{important}} species to commercial fisheries in parts of Asia, and as such has had significant research published on its biology and ecology. All of this information is published in relatively obscure Indian journals and is unavailable to most institutions. The torpedo scad is a predatory fish which both consumes larger prey and filter feeds to consume planktonic organisms. Larger prey items include a variety of fish and cephalopods including squid and cuttlefish. Smaller foods are mostly crustaceans such as shrimps, prawns, stomatopods, cladocerans and crabs. Molluscs and gastropods are also reported to be minor constituents of the diet of the species. The species also appears to have dietary shifts as it grows, however in all size classes fish are the dominant prey. Species recorded as being predators of torpedo scad include species of drums and <b>requiem</b> <b>shark.</b> Each sex of the torpedo scad reach sexual maturity at different lengths; females are mature by 22cm and males by 26.4cm. Other studies have suggested similar lengths, including 17cm in males and 27cm in females, {{as well as an}} average of 25cm in both sexes. Spawning has not been directly observed, however peaks in larval abundance are known from March to July, with a peak in June in India. the eggs are pelagic, and are spherical and transparent with a yolk and single oil globule. The larval stage is extensively described, with the species having 24 myomeres. The growth of the species is not reported, however numerous morphometric (length vs weight) studies have been carried out on the species. The population structure in Indian waters has also been well studied, with the most recent of these suggesting a major recruitment event occurs between May and August. These studies also guide fisheries regulations, with a theoretical maximum yield achieved when fish are only taken once they reach 18cm.|$|E
