Receipts are considered credit transactions while payments are considered debit transactions. The {{balance of payments}} {{is a function of}} three components: transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the current account, transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the financial account, and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the capital account. The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official <b>reserve</b> <b>account,</b> which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.|$|E
25|$|To smooth {{temporary}} or cyclical {{changes in}} the money supply, the desk engages in repurchase agreements (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On {{the day of the}} transaction, the Fed deposits money in a primary dealer's <b>reserve</b> <b>account,</b> and receives the promised securities as collateral. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the primary dealer's <b>reserve</b> <b>account</b> for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.|$|E

This does not require the creation of new physical currency, unless a direct payment bank demands to exchange a part of its electronic money against banknotes or coins.|$|E

It shows that the information content of money stock announcements and the response of asset prices to new information in the announcements vary with changes in the monetary policy regime, the Federal Reserve operating procedures, and the <b>reserve</b> <b>accounting</b> rules. While previous studies have examined how asset prices respond to the money stock announcements under the interest-rate targeting procedure and the nonborrowed reserve procedure, we have included new evidence from the borrowed reserve targeting procedure under both lagged and contemporaneous <b>reserve</b> <b>accounting</b> rules. Looking at how both forward exchange rates and other asset prices respond to the announcements, we distinguish between periods when the asset-price response reflected {{a change in the}} real interest rate and those when it reflected a change in the inflation premium. Finally, we show that the new contemporaneous <b>reserve</b> <b>accounting</b> rules have greatly reduced the information content of the money stock announcements.

2500|$|In {{an owner}} trust, {{there is more}} {{flexibility}} in allocating principal and interest received to different classes of issued securities. [...] In an owner trust, both interest and principal due to subordinate securities {{can be used to}} pay senior securities. [...] Due to this, owner trusts can tailor maturity, risk and return profiles of issued securities to investor needs. [...] Usually, any income remaining after expenses is kept in a <b>reserve</b> <b>account</b> up to a specified level and then after that, all income is returned to the seller. Owner trusts allow credit risk to be mitigated by over-collateralization by using excess reserves and excess finance income to prepay securities before principal, which leaves more collateral for the other classes.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the overall}} BoP {{accounts}} will always balance when {{all types of}} payments are included, imbalances are possible on individual elements of the BoP, such as the current account, the capital account excluding the central bank's <b>reserve</b> <b>account,</b> or {{the sum of the}} two. [...] Imbalances in the latter sum can result in surplus countries accumulating wealth, while deficit nations become increasingly indebted. [...] The term balance of payments often refers to this sum: a country's balance of payments is said to be in surplus (equivalently, the balance of payments is positive) by a specific amount if sources of funds (such as export goods sold and bonds sold) exceed uses of funds (such as paying for imported goods and paying for foreign bonds purchased) by that amount. There {{is said to be a}} balance of payments deficit (the balance of payments is said to be negative) if the former are less than the latter.
