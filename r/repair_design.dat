50|$|PSIOWA {{began to}} expand rapidly before the war and began to {{undertake}} aircraft maintenance and modification in their hangars at the airport, {{in addition to the}} successful ferry services. At the start of the Second World War PSIOWA were ordered to stop their flying services in order to concentrate on the manufacture and repair side of the business. PSIOWA planes and pilots (including famous aviator Amy Johnson) were sent to serve as part of the National Air Communications Scheme while the site and skills at the Portsmouth Airport site were used to repair and modify several thousand military aircraft for return to service. The company changed its name to Portsmouth Aviation in 1946, with a view to expanding both the aviation and manufacturing sides of the business and, the following year, their newly designed Portsmouth Aerocar made its first flight. This five-seat aircraft had an unusual twin-engined, twin-boom, high-wing layout. It was exhibited at the Farnborough Air Show1948 and 1949 but due to the nationalisation of the rail and air services the company were unable to manufacture orders received for the craft. Around 1950, the company built a modest number of bus bodies. The company continued to run a smaller air-ferry service to overseas destinations, but development occurred on the manufacturing, <b>repair,</b> <b>design</b> and development sides of the business. The company continues to operate at this site, now offering a range of services beyond aviation.|$|E

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to examine {{the effectiveness of a}} rapid repair to a helicopter composite frame-to-skin junction subjected to battlefield damage. The <b>repair</b> <b>design</b> consists of a laminate patch and aluminium angle bracket adhesively bonded and riveted, respectively, to the helicopter external surface. The assessment involved a relative comparison of three models, representing pristine, damaged and repaired configurations. Computational analyses were conducted to examine the stiffness and buckling onset load of the overall structure and the strengths of individual components (laminates, adhesive bondlines and rivets) under three typical load conditions, namely in-plane shear, axial compression and transverse compression. The results showed that the damage would cause significant stiffness and strength reduction. The repair could sufficiently restore the stiffness and static strength for the load cases considered. However, for the specimen without support from its adjacent helicopter structure, it is predicted that the failure mode under the transverse compression loading would be via buckling under a relatively low load. A compression test {{was conducted}} to further validate the <b>repair</b> <b>design.</b> The result agreed well with the prediction. It showed that compared with an un-repaired damaged specimen, the external repair increased the strength by 83 %. The equivalent far field failure strain exceeded 3300 μe which is considered satisfactory for a rapid field battle damage repair (BDR) ...|$|E
