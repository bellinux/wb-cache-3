[...] Although the underlying basis for these lifespan differences is still uncertain, numerous {{studies indicate that}} the ability to repair DNA damages is an important determinant of mammalian lifespan. [...] In a 1974 study by Hart and Setlow, it was found that DNA excision <b>repair</b> <b>capability</b> increased systematically with species lifespan among seven mammalian species. Species lifespan was observed to be robustly correlated with the capacity to recognize DNA double-strand breaks as well as the level of the DNA repair protein Ku80. [...] In a study of the cells from sixteen mammalian species, genes employed in DNA repair were found to be up-regulated in the longer-lived species.

500|$|Cryptococcus neoformans is an {{encapsulated}} yeast {{that can}} live in both plants and animals. C. neoformans usually infects the lungs, where it is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. Some C. neoformans can survive inside macrophages, {{which appears to be}} the basis for latency, disseminated disease, and resistance to antifungal agents. One mechanism by which C. neoformans survives the hostile macrophage environment is by up-regulating the expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response. Another mechanism involves meiosis. The majority of C. neoformans are mating [...] "type a". Filaments of mating [...] "type a" [...] ordinarily have haploid nuclei, but they can become diploid (perhaps by endoduplication or by stimulated nuclear fusion) to form blastospores. The diploid nuclei of blastospores can undergo meiosis, including recombination, to form haploid basidiospores that can be dispersed. This process is referred to as monokaryotic fruiting. this process requires a gene called DMC1, which is a conserved homologue of genes recA in bacteria and RAD51 in eukaryotes, that mediates homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis and repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Thus, C. neoformans can undergo a meiosis, monokaryotic fruiting, that promotes recombinational repair in the oxidative, DNA damaging environment of the host macrophage, and the <b>repair</b> <b>capability</b> may contribute to its virulence.|$|E

2500|$|The DNA damage {{theory of}} aging is a {{prominent}} explanation for aging {{at the molecular}} level. [...] This theory postulates that DNA damage is ubiquitous in the biological world and is {{the primary cause of}} aging. [...] Consistent with this theory, genetic elements that regulate repair of DNA damage in somatic cells were proposed to have pleiotropic effects that are beneficial during early development but allow deleterious consequences later in life. As an example, studies of mammalian brain and muscle have shown that DNA <b>repair</b> <b>capability</b> is relatively high during early development when cells are dividing mitotically, but declines substantially as cells enter the post-mitotic state. [...] The reduction in DNA <b>repair</b> <b>capability</b> presumably reflects an evolutionary adaptation for diverting resources from cell duplication and repair to more essential neuronal and muscular functions. [...] The effect of reducing expression of DNA <b>repair</b> <b>capability</b> is to allow increased accumulation of DNA damage. [...] This then impairs gene transcription and causes the progressive loss of cellular and tissue functions that define aging.|$|E
2500|$|Accumulated DNA damage {{appears to}} be a {{limiting}} factor in the determination of maximum life span. The theory that DNA damage is the primary cause of aging, and thus a principal determinant of maximum life span, has attracted increased interest in recent years. [...] This is based, in part, on evidence in human and mouse that inherited deficiencies in DNA repair genes often cause accelerated aging. There is also substantial evidence that DNA damage accumulates with age in mammalian tissues, such as those of the brain, muscle, liver and kidney (reviewed by Bernstein et al. and see DNA damage theory of aging and DNA damage (naturally occurring)). [...] One expectation of the theory (that DNA damage is the primary cause of aging) is that among species with differing maximum life spans, the capacity to repair DNA damage should correlate with lifespan. [...] The first experimental test of this idea was by Hart and Setlow who measured the capacity of cells from seven different mammalian species to carry out DNA repair. [...] They found that nucleotide excision <b>repair</b> <b>capability</b> increased systematically with species longevity. [...] This correlation was striking and stimulated a series of 11 additional experiments in different laboratories over succeeding years on the relationship of nucleotide excision repair and life span in mammalian species (reviewed by Bernstein and Bernstein). [...] In general, the findings of these studies indicated a good correlation between nucleotide excision repair capacity and life span. [...] The association between nucleotide excision <b>repair</b> <b>capability</b> and longevity is strengthened by the evidence that defects in nucleotide excision repair proteins in humans and rodents cause features of premature aging, as reviewed by Diderich.|$|E
