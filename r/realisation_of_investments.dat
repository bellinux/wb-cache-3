40|$|Since the ’ 80 s, {{economic}} {{literature has}} {{stressed the importance}} of external financing on enterprises’ investment decisions; in particular the pecking order theory highlighted the existence of a hierarchy of financing sources, an approach that originates from the existence of asymmetric information between fund borrowers and lenders. The presence of effective financial constraints to the <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> of productive units was reasserted in the work by Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen (1988), which was followed by ample empirical and theoretical analysis of enterprises’ information opacity, of the consequent effects on access to external financing and of the lower cost of financing originating from internal cash flows generated by enterprise management. The present contribution delves into the analysis of the possible existence of financial constraints to enterprises’ investment decisions in different OECD countries, using as analytical tools the indicators of the composition of financial instruments within the liabilities and the net lending-net borrowing for the sector of non-financial corporations. The sources of information are OECD databases on financial and nonfinancial accounts per institutional sector. ...|$|E

40|$|Value {{creation}} {{is the core}} purpose of organisations, and the Value Creation Logics (VCLs) describe how organisations create value for their customers through the provision of goods or services. VCLs can help organisations understand and model their business processes in order to fully utilise their resources and achieve optimal performances. Most organisations rely heavily on IS/IT for their value creation. Alignment between IS/IT and business strategies {{as well as with}} the VCLs thus plays a key role in the benefits <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> IT <b>investment.</b> This paper investigates the empirical <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> different VCLs, and the role of IS/IT therein, through a case study of a UK law firm.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} of various development areas (transport, energy, building) to make the cost-efficient <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> high-profile <b>investments,</b> and organising and holding international sports events possible. Using a case study, the paper introduces development routes based on the evaluation of environmental and economic perspectives. The current research introduces the investment characteristics based {{on the development of}} the Hungarian building, energy and transport sectors for the 2017 - 2030 period. The main criterion is the integration of ‘circular economy’. For sectors which operate with high material and energy consumption, the consideration of circular economy principles may prove to be important for sustainable development. Through planning highvolume sports and worldwide events, the usual development strategy for traffic systems focuses on public transport and rentable vehicles (f. e. electric scooter, or bicycle) which can decrease CO 2 emissions via modern technological solutions. Regarding the buildings, sports arenas and related facilities, besides the existing low-carbon solutions, the functions of buildings must be expanded and their usage prolonged. The management of waste left after the life cycle is expended has to be pre-planned. These are the options for making the sector’s GHG emissions decrease apart from circular tenders, which can be further combined with SMART energetic solutions...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{driver for}} this {{research}} was the continuing high failure rate <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> in IS/IT which has stayed at around 70 - 80 % for over 30 years. The aim {{of this research was}} to explore the extent to which organisations have adopted benefits driven practices when undertaking investments in IS/IT. An initial phase of the research was primarily based on detailed documentation on 25 projects taken from the knowledge management database of an IS/IT consultancy. A second phase comprised in-depth case studies at three organisations. This phase explored the practices adopted on three or four projects at each organisation and importantly the wider organisational context in which the projects took place. An important contribution from this research has been the development of a framework of competences and practices for the <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> benefits from <b>investments</b> in IS/IT. The empirical elements of the study then go well beyond recent survey-based research, by providing in-depth insights into the practice <b>of</b> benefits <b>realisation,</b> across a variety of organisations. The empirical study showed that benefits-related practices are very rarely adopted. The research has also provided evidence {{of the value of the}} practices 'lens', which is shown to provide a valuable way to operationalise competences, as it fits very well with how people think and work.
