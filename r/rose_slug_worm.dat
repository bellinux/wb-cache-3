25|$|Many {{small animals}} {{live in the}} Westland region, {{including}} plant-eaters such as snails, <b>slugs,</b> <b>worms,</b> insect larvae, millipedes, and sprintails. Carnivorous small animals include an extensive number of centipedes, ground beetles, and {{a huge number of}} spider species. A large number of the spiders that live on the ground do not build webs, rather they rely on speed and sight to catch prey.|$|R

5000|$|The Enigma (Paul Lawrence), {{originally}} {{known as}} Slug, {{was billed as}} a man who would eat anything (including <b>slugs,</b> <b>worms,</b> and grasshoppers), and swallow a variety of swords. He also doubled as the show's organ player. His body is completely tattooed with blue jigsaw puzzle pieces. He left the show in 1998 and has toured since, appearing in such acts as The Human Marvels and most recently, the Show Devils.|$|R
50|$|The {{species can}} be found in forests, parks, and gardens. They are nocturnal. Both adults and larvae feed on <b>slugs,</b> snails, <b>worms</b> and insects (presumably weevils).|$|R
50|$|The ribbon snake has {{a diverse}} diet {{consisting}} of <b>worms,</b> <b>slugs,</b> minnows, and insects.|$|R
50|$|The glue was {{developed}} in a collaboration between Boston Children's Hospital, MIT and Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. It {{was inspired by the}} viscous, water-repellant fluids secreted by animals such as <b>slugs,</b> sandcastle <b>worms</b> and insect footpads.|$|R
50|$|These {{reptiles}} {{are mostly}} active during the twilight and occasionally {{bask in the}} sun, but are more often found hiding beneath rocks and logs. They are carnivorous and, because they feed on <b>slugs</b> and <b>worms,</b> they can often be found in long grass and other damp environments.|$|R
50|$|These {{extremely}} small sea slugs are meiofauna; they live among sand grains. Pseudovermis means fake <b>worm,</b> because these <b>slugs</b> resemble minute <b>worms.</b>|$|R
25|$|Boettgerilla pallens, {{common name}} the <b>worm</b> <b>slug,</b> is a European species of {{air-breathing}} land slug, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk {{in the family}} Boettgerillidae.|$|R
50|$|The {{long-haired}} {{grass mouse}} is active {{both in the}} day and the night. It is an efficient excavator and digs burrows, {{but it is also a}} good tree climber. In Argentina it feeds on berries, seeds, insects, <b>slugs,</b> <b>worms,</b> fungi and fern spores. The diet differs in different parts of Chile, either consisting of insects and plant material, or insects and fungi, just insects or just fungi. Breeding takes place in the spring and summer. The litter size averages just below four and at least some individuals overwinter twice. Home ranges in the Patagonian Nothofagus forest vary between 0.4 and 4.8 individuals per hectare in spring, and 2.8 to 10.8 individuals per hectare in autumn. This grass mouse is preyed on by the barn owl, the lesser horned owl, the rufous-legged owl, the white-tailed kite and the South American gray fox. It is also an important reservoir species for the Andes virus, which is a major causative agent of the disease Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.|$|R
50|$|Several animal groups {{studied in}} Australia consist largely of {{short-range}} endemics, including freshwater and terrestrial gastropods (snails and <b>slugs),</b> earthworms, velvet <b>worms,</b> mygalomorph spiders, schizomids, millipedes, phreatoicidean crustaceans, and freshwater crayfish.|$|R
50|$|As part of {{the soil}} ecosystem, land planarians feed mainly on other invertebrates, such as earthworms, snails, <b>slugs,</b> nemerteans, velvet <b>worms,</b> woodlice, millipedes, insects and arachnids. Some may even feed on other land planarians.|$|R
5000|$|Typical detritivorous animals include millipedes, springtails, woodlice, dung flies, <b>slugs,</b> many [...] <b>worms,</b> sea stars, sea cucumbers, fiddler crabs, {{and some}} {{sedentary}} polychaetes such as amphitrites (Amphitritinae, worms {{of the family}} Terebellidae) and other terebellids.|$|R
50|$|The shrew's {{carnivorous}} and insectivorous diet consists {{mostly of}} insects, <b>slugs,</b> spiders, <b>worms,</b> amphibians and small rodents. Shrews need to consume 2000-3000% {{of their body}} weight each day in order to survive. A shrew must eat {{every two to three}} hours to achieve this goal. This means that a shrew may starve if it finds no food for as little as 5 hours. They do not hibernate in the winter months because their bodies are too small to hold sufficient fat reserves.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the diets of some Echis species. For others, their diets are {{reported}} to be extremely varied, and may include items such as locusts, beetles, <b>worms,</b> <b>slugs,</b> spiders, scorpions, centipedes, solifugids, frogs, toads, reptiles (including other snakes), small mammals, and birds.|$|R
50|$|Animal life also exhibit {{changes with}} {{changing}} communities. In lichen stage the fauna is sparse. It comprises few mites, ants and spiders {{living in the}} cracks and crevices. The fauna undergoes a qualitative increase during herb grass stage. The animals found during this stage include nematodes, insects larvae, ants, spiders, mites, etc. The animal population increases and diversifies {{with the development of}} forest climax community. The fauna consists of invertebrates like <b>slugs,</b> snails, <b>worms,</b> millipedes, centipedes, ants, bugs; and vertebrates such as squirrels, foxes, mice, moles, snakes, various birds, salamanders and frogs.|$|R

5000|$|Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is protandrous autogamous hermaphrodite, {{whose main}} {{substrate}} to reproduce on is mainly bacterial rich environments such as decomposing cadavers (<b>slugs,</b> snails, <b>worms,</b> insects), leaves, compost and slug faeces. Third stage infective dauers seek out new hosts [...] responding to host cues such as slime and faeces [...] or a bacteria rich environment. Once a new host is found, the dauer enters the slug via the dorsal integumental pouch beneath the mantle {{and then to}} the shell cavity via the short canal, next the dauer then develops into a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite and starts to produce young. The mother can produce up to 250-300 young whilst inside their still alive host.|$|R
50|$|The {{lesser white-toothed shrew}} (Crocidura suaveolens) is a tiny shrew with a {{widespread}} distribution in Africa, Asia and Europe. Its preferred habitat is scrub and gardens and it feeds on insects, <b>worms,</b> <b>slugs,</b> snails, newts and small rodents. The closely related Asian lesser white-toothed shrew (Crocidura shantungensis) was once included in this species, but is now {{considered to be a}} separate species.|$|R
50|$|It is {{classified}} alongside the western falanouc, Eupleres major, recognized only in 2010, in the genus Eupleres. Falanoucs have several peculiarities. They have no anal or perineal glands (unlike their closest relative, the fanaloka), nonretractile claws, and a unique dentition: the canines and premolars are backwards-curving and flat. This {{is thought to}} be related to their prey, mostly invertebrates, such as <b>worms,</b> <b>slugs,</b> snails, and larvae.|$|R
25|$|Several {{species of}} {{nematodes}} {{are known to}} parasitise <b>slugs.</b> The nematode <b>worms</b> Agfa flexilis and Angiostoma limacis respectively live in the salivary glands and rectum of Limax maximus. Species of widely known medical importance pertaining to the genus Angiostrongylus are also parasites of slugs. Both Angiostrongylus costaricensis and Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a meningitis-causing nematode, have larval stages that can only live in mollusks, including slugs, such as Limax maximus.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the chapter}} VII the authors {{describe}} in detail a remarkable Lemurian:"In Lemuria {{there was some}} domestication of animals; the egg-headed Lemurian was seen leading about a scaly monster, almost as unattractive as his master. Animals of all sorts were eaten raw - among some tribes human flesh was not despised - and creatures of the grade of our <b>slugs,</b> snails and <b>worms,</b> much larger than their degenerate descendants, were regarded with peculiar favor as toothsome morsels." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} other {{amphibia}} {{the rate of}} development of the larvae is influenced by temperature, with eggs and tadpoles in ponds at higher temperatures developing faster than those at lower temperatures. Newly hatched tadpoles are mainly herbivorous, feeding on algae, detritus, plants and some small invertebrates, but they become fully carnivorous once their back legs develop, feeding on small water animals or even other tadpoles when food is scarce. Juvenile frogs feed on invertebrates both on land and in water but their feeding habits change significantly throughout their lives and older frogs will eat only on land. Adult common frogs will feed on any invertebrate of a suitable size, catching their prey on their long, sticky tongues, although they do not feed at all during the short breeding season. Preferred foods include insects (especially flies), snails, <b>slugs</b> and <b>worms.</b>|$|R
500|$|Land snails are an {{especially}} important food item when drought or hard weather {{makes it hard}} to find other food. The thrush often uses a favourite stone as an [...] "anvil" [...] on which to break the shell of the snail before extracting the soft body and invariably wiping it on the ground before consumption. Young birds initially flick objects and attempt to play with them until they learn to use anvils as tools to smash snails. The nestlings are mainly fed on animal food such as <b>worms,</b> <b>slugs,</b> snails and insect larvae.|$|R
50|$|Tawny frogmouths are {{carnivorous}} and {{are considered}} to be among Australia's most effective pest control birds as their diet consists largely of species regarded as vermin or pests in houses, farms, and gardens. The bulk of their diet is composed of large nocturnal insects such as moths, as well as spiders, <b>worms,</b> <b>slugs,</b> and snails but also includes a variety of bugs, beetles, wasps, ants, centipedes, millipedes, and scorpions. Large numbers of invertebrates are consumed in order to make up sufficient biomass. Small mammals, reptiles, frogs and birds are also eaten.|$|R
50|$|The Red-bellied Snake (Storeria occipitomaculata occipitomaculata) is {{very small}} brown or gray snake with faint stripes down its back. The belly is red, pink, or orange. Adult length is 8 to 16 inches. Red-bellied Snakes inhabit both fields and woods, but are most often found under boards and other objects {{at the edges of}} lumber piles or trash dumps. They feed on <b>worms,</b> <b>slugs,</b> and snails. In Wyoming, the sub-species S. o. pahasapae is found near water under flat rocks, logs, and other surface objects in moist {{woodland}} communities.|$|R
5000|$|The chitinous jaws of annelids (such as {{the marine}} scolecodonts) are {{sometimes}} preserved as fossils; while many arthropods and inarticulate brachiopods have easily fossilized hard parts of calcite, chitin, or keratin. The {{most common and}} often-found macrofossils are the very hard calcareous shells of articulate brachiopods (that is, the everyday [...] "lampshells") and of mollusks (such as the omnipresent clams, snails, mussels and oysters). On the other hand, non-shelly <b>slugs</b> and non-tubiferous <b>worms</b> (for instance, earthworms) have only occasionally been preserved due to their lack of hard parts.|$|R

5000|$|The eggs of the American toad {{are laid}} in two strings and can hatch in 2-14 days. When hatched the tadpoles are {{recognizable}} by their skinny tails {{in relation to}} the size of their black bodies. They may advance to adulthood in 50-65 days. When metamorphosis is completed, the [...] "toadlets" [...] may stay in the water {{for a short period of}} time before they become mostly land based. Often entire groups of tadpoles reach the toadlet stage at once and a mass migration to higher ground takes place usually to shaded areas of mid range and upland forests bordering the marshes from where they bred. Toadlets can be observed eating microscopic bugs as fast as they can in the ground area they roam between various vegetation; they are also known to eat ants, spiders, <b>slugs</b> and <b>worms.</b> Studies have shown that they have a mutualistic relationship with Chlorogonium alga, which makes tadpoles develop faster than normal.|$|R
50|$|They often swim in {{ponds and}} streams, {{but they are}} likely to be preoccupied {{foraging}} in grassy meadows for <b>worms,</b> <b>slugs,</b> even catching flies. They appreciate open spaces but are happy in gardens from which they cannot fly and where they make much less noise than call ducks. Only females quack and drakes are limited to a hoarse whisper. Compared to big table ducks, they eat less grain and pellet supplements. When they are young, they eat rocks to form their gizzard which helps them digest their food. They do not have teeth, so they must have water to soften food.|$|R
5000|$|It is a predator, hunting {{mainly by}} night, feeding {{on a range}} of {{invertebrates}} including <b>worms,</b> <b>slugs,</b> spiders, small moths and woodlice, as well as carrion. [...] The prey is caught in the mandibles which are also used to cut and together with the front legs to manipulate the food into a bolus. [...] The bolus is repeatedly chewed and swallowed, emerging covered with a brown secretion from the foregut, until it is reduced to a liquid which is digested. Skin (in the case of earthworms) and hard materials (from arthropods) are left. The larvae are also carnivorous with similar eating habits.|$|R
5000|$|The {{spotted turtle}} {{is an active}} hunter: seeking out prey items in the water by {{pointing}} its head into aquatic plants. [...] It feeds at temperatures above 14.2 C, which in its range corresponds to roughly the middle of March onward until September. It is omnivorous and eats exclusively in the water, consuming plant material including aquatic vegetation, green algae, and {{in at least one}} instance, wild cranberries. Animal food includes aquatic insect larvae, <b>worms,</b> <b>slugs,</b> millipedes, spiders, crustaceans, tadpoles, salamanders, and several genera of small fish These items are consumed alive or dead but always in the water. [...] Some of the insects commonly found in with the spotted turtle's stomach contents are terrestrial, suggesting the turtle moves onto land to hunt. [...] In captivity, these turtles will eat fruits such as cantaloupe and watermelon and fresh and canned fish.|$|R
