25|$|February 7, 1812, 0945 UTC (3:45a.m.); (M ~7.5) {{epicenter}} near New Madrid, Missouri. This was {{the largest}} event in the series, and it destroyed the town of New Madrid. At St. Louis, Missouri, many houses were severely damaged, and their chimneys were toppled. It appears to have occurred on Reelfoot fault, a <b>reverse</b> <b>fault</b> segment that crosses under the Mississippi River just south of Kentucky Bend and continues to the east as the Lake County Uplift. In this event, uplift along the fault created temporary waterfalls on the Mississippi River, created a wave that propagated upstream, and caused the formation of Reelfoot Lake by damming streams.|$|E

500|$|Waveform {{modeling}} {{established that}} the faulting originated {{at a depth of}} [...] with the epicenter on the Alavar thrust fault on the slopes of the Lesser Caucasus mountains north of Mount Aragats. The mainshock produced surface rupture and propagated to the west with a separate strike-slip sub-event occurring two seconds later that propagated to the southeast. Going westward the fault split into two branches, a north-dipping <b>reverse</b> <b>fault</b> (north branch) and a right slip fault (south branch), but neither produced surface rupture. A total of five sub-events occurred in the first eleven seconds and an aftershock measuring 5.8 (local magnitude) occurred four minutes and twenty seconds later.|$|E
500|$|The epicenters of the {{recorded}} aftershocks formed a relatively narrow [...] band. On {{the east end}} the events were shallow while the western side, {{where the majority of}} the larger aftershocks were concentrated, the hypocenters were up to [...] deep. The shocks at the southeastern segment indicated right-lateral strike-slip movement along a nearly vertical fault, and may have been related to the Alavar fault. Moving westward closer to the central segments though, a transition of the fault type was becoming apparent, where an almost equal distribution of <b>reverse</b> <b>fault</b> mechanisms were observed as the strike-slip type. The east-central segment coincided with the surface breaks between Spitak and Gekhasar, while the west-central portion's break was concealed under an anticline and was not visible at the surface. Along the western segments the fault split into two branches with one to the southwest and the other to the northwest.|$|E
50|$|The {{epicenter}} of the earthquake lies within a diffuse zone of seismicity known as the Azores-Gibraltar seismic belt, which marks {{the boundary between the}} African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The deformation at this plate boundary is transpressional in style, with dextral (right lateral) strike-slip accompanied by slow convergence (4 mm/yr). Linear bathymetric features within this zone, such as the SW-NE trending Gorringe Bank, are thought to be a result of <b>reverse</b> <b>faulting.</b> Investigations using multibeam swathe bathymetry have revealed additional SW-NE trending <b>reverse</b> <b>faults</b> and fold axes and a set of WNW-ESE trending lineaments, interpreted as strike-slip faults. The earthquake was located within the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain, where active <b>reverse</b> <b>faulting</b> has been imaged on seismic reflection data.|$|R
30|$|In {{spite of}} the clear {{topographical}} features, the RBF was not identified as an active fault. The Ou backbone range has been an arc parallel to a major uplifted zone since the Pliocene and is commonly bounded by active <b>reverse</b> <b>faults.</b> There is not much difference in the summit altitudes of the backbone range, whether bounded by active <b>reverse</b> <b>faults</b> or not, suggesting potential hidden active faults beneath the mountain flank.|$|R

Compressional tectonic movement commenced in the Late Paleogene, creating an intermontane foreland basin enclosed by the Serranía del Perijá and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The east-west oriented dextral strike-slip Oca Fault in the north is estimated to have been active since the Early Eocene with a total displacement of [...] The Bucaramanga-Santa Marta Fault was a Jurassic extensional rift fault, reactivated as oblique <b>reverse</b> <b>fault</b> in the Oligocene.|$|E
2500|$|The Tacoma Fault (at right, {{and also}} between lines C and D on the Uplift and basin map, above) {{just north of}} the city of Tacoma, Washington has been {{described}} as [...] "one of the most striking geophysical anomalies in the Puget Lowland". The western part is an active east–west striking north dipping <b>reverse</b> <b>fault</b> that separates the Seattle Uplift and the Tacoma Basin, with approximately 30 miles (50km) of identified surface rupture. It is believed capable of generating earthquakes of at least magnitude 7, and there is evidence of such a quake approximately 1,000 years ago, possibly the same earthquake documented on the Seattle Fault 24 miles (38km) to the north. This is likely not coincidental, as it appears that the Tacoma and Seattle faults converge at depth (see diagram above) in a way that north-south compression tends to force the Seattle Uplift up, resulting in dip-slip movement on both fault zones.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} {{earthquake}} investigations in California {{has been largely}} focused on the San Andreas Fault System, due to its strong influence in the state as {{the boundary between the}} Pacific Plate and the North American Plate; it is the most studied fault on Earth. Andrew Lawson, a geologist from the University of California, Berkeley, had named the fault after the San Andreas Lake (prior to the occurrence of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake) and later led an investigation into that event. The San Andreas Fault ruptured for a length of [...] during the 1906 shock, both to the north of San Francisco and to the south in the Santa Cruz Mountains region. Several long term forecasts for a large shock along the San Andreas Fault in that area had been made public prior to 1989 (the event and its aftershocks occurred within a recognized seismic gap) but the earthquake that transpired was not what had been anticipated. The 1989 Loma Prieta event originated on an undiscovered oblique-slip <b>reverse</b> <b>fault</b> that is located adjacent to the San Andreas Fault.|$|E
