50|$|A {{classic example}} of {{dominance}} is the inheritance of seed shape (pea shape) in peas. <b>Peas</b> may be <b>round</b> (associated with allele R) or wrinkled (associated with allele r). In this case, three combinations of alleles (genotypes) are possible: RR and rr are homozygous and Rr is heterozygous. The RR individuals have <b>round</b> <b>peas</b> and the rr individuals have wrinkled peas. In Rr individuals the R allele masks {{the presence of the}} r allele, so these individuals also have <b>round</b> <b>peas.</b> Thus, allele R is dominant to allele r, and allele r is recessive to allele R.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} test his hypothesis, Mendel {{predicted}} {{the outcome of a}} breeding experiment that he had not carried out yet. He crossed heterozygous <b>round</b> <b>peas</b> (Rr) with wrinkled (homozygous, rr) ones. He predicted that in this case one-half of the seeds produced would be round (Rr) and one-half wrinkled (rr).|$|R

50|$|To {{a casual}} {{observer}} in the monastery garden, the cross appeared {{no different from}} the P cross described above: round-seeded peas being crossed with wrinkled-seeded ones. But Mendel predicted that this time he would produce both round and wrinkled seeds and in a 50:50 ratio. He performed the cross and harvested 106 <b>round</b> <b>peas</b> and 101 wrinkled peas.|$|R

[...] "Tea," [...] however, {{we had in}} abundance; though, I dare say, the Hong merchants {{never had}} the {{shipping}} of it.

5000|$|In genetics, symbols {{began as}} {{algebraic}} placeholders. When one allele is dominant to another, the oldest convention is {{to symbolize the}} dominant allele with a capital letter. The recessive allele is assigned the same letter in lower case. In the pea example, once the dominance {{relationship between the two}} alleles is known, it is possible to designate the dominant allele that produces a round shape by a capital-letter symbol R, and the recessive allele that produces a wrinkled shape by a lower-case symbol r. The homozygous dominant, heterozygous, and homozygous recessive genotypes are then written RR, Rr, and rr, respectively. It would also be possible to designate the two alleles as W and w, and the three genotypes WW, Ww, and ww, the first two of which produced <b>round</b> <b>peas</b> and the third wrinkled peas. Note that the choice of [...] "R" [...] or [...] "W" [...] as the symbol for the dominant allele does not pre-judge whether the allele causing the [...] "round" [...] or [...] "wrinkled" [...] phenotype when homozygous is the dominant one.|$|R
5000|$|In 1861, both Chilly and {{his younger}} brother, D.N. McIntosh, signed the treaty that {{formally}} allied the Creek Nation with the Confederate States of America. [...] Despite his age and relative lack of prior military experience, Chilly entered the Confederate Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel, commanding the First Battalion of Creek Cavalry. ln 1862, {{he was promoted to}} full colonel as the unit was reorganized into the Second Regiment of Creek Mounted Volunteers. He and his troops fought in several battles in the Indian Territory, such as <b>Round</b> Mountain, <b>Pea</b> Ridge, Fort Wayne, and Honey Springs.|$|R
6000|$|Andrew Knight (9/85. 'Phil. Tract.' 1799 page 196.) has {{observed}} that the varieties of peas keep very true, {{because they are not}} crossed by insects. As far as the fact of keeping true is concerned, I hear from Mr. Masters of Canterbury, well known as the originator of several new kinds, that certain varieties have remained constant for a considerable time,--for instance, KNIGHT'S BLUE DWARF, which came out about the year 1820. (9/86. 'Gardener's Magazine' volume 1 1826 page 153.) But the greater number of varieties have a singularly short existence: thus Loudon remarks (9/87. 'Encyclopaedia of Gardening' page 823.) that [...] "sorts which were highly approved in 1821, are now, in 1833, nowhere to be found;" [...] and on comparing the lists of 1833 with those of 1855, I find that nearly all the varieties have changed. Mr. Masters informs me that the nature of the soil causes some varieties to lose their character. As with other plants, certain varieties can be propagated truly, whilst others show a determined tendency to vary; thus two peas differing in shape, one round and the other wrinkled, were found by Mr. Masters within the same pod, but the plants raised from the wrinkled kind always evinced a strong tendency to produce <b>round</b> <b>peas.</b> Mr. Masters also raised from a plant of another variety four distinct sub-varieties, which bore blue and round, white and round, blue and wrinkled, and white and wrinkled peas; and although he sowed these four varieties separately during several successive years, each kind always reproduced all four kinds mixed together! ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1936, R.A. Fisher, a {{prominent}} statistician and population geneticist, reconstructed Mendel's experiments, analyzed {{results from the}} F2 (second filial) generation and found the ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes (e.g. green versus yellow peas; <b>round</b> versus wrinkled <b>peas)</b> to be implausibly and consistently {{too close to the}} expected ratio of 3 to 1. Fisher asserted that [...] "the data of most, if not all, of the experiments have been falsified so as to agree closely with Mendel's expectations," [...] Mendel's alleged observations, according to Fisher, were [...] "abominable", [...] "shocking", and [...] "cooked".|$|R
5000|$|Born in Chrudim, part of {{historic}} Bohemia, Jirásek {{started his career}} at Sparta Prague. In July 2008 he was signed by Italian football club F.C. Internazionale Milano. He was the member of Allievi Nazionali [...] under-17 team in the first season. In the next season {{he was promoted to}} the senior youth team - the Primavera under-20 team but only played 4 times in the league. In January 2010 he was loaned to Sassuolo. Jirásek played 11 out of possible 11 matches for its Primavera (literally [...] "spring"), with 10 starts. (He was as sub against Grosseto). That season the team composed with former Inter youth products, such as Mame Baba Thiam (forward) and Alberto Gallinetta (goalkeeper), who also returned to Inter. He was the midfielder of the team, or as a wing forward in his first appearance. In 2010-11 season Jirásek returned to Inter [...] "spring" [...] and made 20 appearances, 13 of them as starter. The team also stick to the internal policy of changing the team to U-19 team with a few U20 player. (3 in 2010-11 season) He shared the starting role with Andrea Romanò, or even played as an emergency left back or right wing forward. The two other solid member of the midfielder were Lorenzo Crisetig and Sebastian Carlsén. He won 2011 Torneo di Viareggio with Inter. Jirásek was the starting midfielder in the play-off round, with the second <b>round</b> Fulvio <b>Pea</b> changed to use 4-4-2 formation.|$|R
25|$|While {{carrying}} out breeding experiments {{to clarify the}} mechanism of inheritance in 1900, Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns independently rediscovered Gregor Mendel's work. News of this reached William Bateson in England, who reported on the paper during a presentation to the Royal Horticultural Society in May 1900. In Mendelian inheritance, the contributions of each parent retain their integrity rather than blending with {{the contribution of the}} other parent. In the case of a cross between two true-breeding varieties such as Mendel's <b>round</b> and wrinkled <b>peas,</b> the first-generation offspring are all alike, in this case all round. Allowing these to cross, the original characteristics reappear (segregation): about 3/4 of their offspring are round, 1/4 wrinkled. There is a discontinuity between the appearance of the offspring; de Vries coined the term allele for a variant form of an inherited characteristic. This reinforced a major division of thought, already present in the 1890s, between gradualists who followed Darwin, and saltationists such as Bateson.|$|R
60|$|The great {{race of the}} day {{had just}} been run; and the close lines of people, {{on either side of}} the course, {{suddenly}} breaking up and pouring into it, imparted a new liveliness to the scene, which was again all busy movement. Some hurried eagerly to catch a glimpse of the winning horse; others darted to and fro, searching, no less eagerly, for the carriages they had left in quest of better stations. Here, a little knot gathered <b>round</b> a <b>pea</b> and thimble table to watch the plucking of some unhappy greenhorn; and there, another proprietor with his confederates in various disguises--one man in spectacles; another, with an eyeglass and a stylish hat; a third, dressed as a farmer well to do in the world, with his top-coat over his arm and his flash notes in a large leathern pocket-book; and all with heavy-handled whips to represent most innocent country fellows who had trotted there on horseback--sought, by loud and noisy talk and pretended play, to entrap some unwary customer, while the gentlemen confederates (of more villainous aspect still, in clean linen and good clothes), betrayed their close interest in the concern by the anxious furtive glance they cast on all new comers. These would be hanging on the outskirts of a wide circle of people assembled round some itinerant juggler, opposed, in his turn, by a noisy band of music, or the classic game of 'Ring the Bull,' while ventriloquists holding dialogues with wooden dolls, and fortune-telling women smothering the cries of real babies, divided with them, and many more, the general attention of the company. Drinking-tents were full, glasses began to clink in carriages, hampers to be unpacked, tempting provisions to be set forth, knives and forks to rattle, champagne corks to fly, eyes to brighten that were not dull before, and pickpockets to count their gains during the last heat. The attention so recently strained on one object of interest, was now divided among a hundred; and look where you would, there was a motley assemblage of feasting, laughing, talking, begging, gambling, and mummery.|$|R
