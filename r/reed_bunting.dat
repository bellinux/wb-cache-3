25|$|Sound Heath {{forms an}} {{important}} breeding {{site for a}} wide range of birds. Locally rare species include the Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and the willow tit (Parus montanus). Among the other species that have been observed here are the moorhen, <b>reed</b> <b>bunting,</b> turtle dove and willow warbler, the tawny, little and barn owls, and the greater spotted, lesser spotted and green woodpeckers.|$|E
25|$|Otters have {{recently}} recolonised {{the upper reaches}} of the river, however the water vole is now confined to a few isolated populations. Notable species of invertebrates include uncommon mayflies. There is a diverse breeding bird community including lapwing, snipe and redshank. Wildfowl such as mallard and mute swans may also be seen, along with yellow wagtail, sedge warbler, reed warbler and <b>reed</b> <b>bunting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bird {{species on}} the island include pale-bellied brent geese, Eurasian curlews, Eurasian oystercatchers, grey plovers, {{northern}} shovellers, little egrets, <b>reed</b> <b>buntings</b> and little terns.|$|R
50|$|The {{rich mix}} of {{habitats}} provides a valuable {{home to a}} wide range of wildlife, including <b>reed</b> <b>buntings,</b> skylarks, great crested newts, and slowworms.|$|R
50|$|Butterflies {{includes}} Duke of Burgundy {{and small}} blue. Downland and wetland birds include dipper, kingfisher, yellowhammer and tree pipit. <b>Reed</b> <b>buntings</b> breed in the marsh.|$|R
25|$|The {{landscape}} is rocky moorland with a covering of coarse grass and bracken. Several spinneys of woodland (pine and mixed deciduous) are enclosed by stone walls {{and are not}} accessible to the public. There {{are a number of}} magnificent specimens of ancient oaks several hundreds of years old. The park is home to herds of red deer and fallow deer. Birdlife is profuse â€“ the reservoir attracts many species of wildfowl, as does the river and the spinneys provide secluded nesting areas for many other species, including large colonies of rooks. Species such as yellowhammer, <b>reed</b> <b>bunting,</b> skylark and meadow pipit are a common sight in the open areas of the park. Deadly nightshade is allowed to grow within the ruins of Bradgate House, having been originally established there during World War II by Leicester Polytechnic's School of Pharmacy for medicinal purposes.|$|E
500|$|There are 40 local nature {{reserves}} in Somerset recognised by Natural England. The smallest is Wellington Basins, which covers [...] of small ponds and surrounding grassland and woodland. This provides a habitat for grey wagtail, dipper and <b>reed</b> <b>bunting.</b> The largest, covering , is Weston Woods on Worlebury Hill, [...] which includes Worlebury Camp Iron Age hill fort. The woodland provides a habitat for mammals including deer, badgers, foxes and bats. Birds include woodpeckers, buzzards and treecreepers. Several {{of the sites}} are Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The list includes sites owned or managed by both Avon Wildlife Trust and Somerset Wildlife Trust.|$|E
500|$|Birch Moss Covert {{is a small}} {{woodland}} containing birch, alder and willow trees, as well {{as various}} species of flora and fauna. The small mammal population includes the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), which attract both kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) and sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus). Foxes, stoats, weasels, and badgers, are often seen. The area is part of Shell's estate, covering about [...] of land managed by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The trust also manages a small nature reserve located within Manchester United's training ground. This provides a habitat {{for a number of}} species including the red admiral butterfly (Vanessa atalanta), meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis), and grey partridge (Perdix perdix). Carrington Moss is home to the only recorded pairs of breeding grey partridge in Trafford. Six pairs of Eurasian bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) were recorded in 2003. The reduction in the population of these and similar birds is attributed to modern farming methods, the loss of broad hedgerows, and the lack of winter stubble. Action for Nature in Trafford has therefore included the site in its Biodiversity Action Plan. The group intends to develop Carrington Moss as a home for other species, such as <b>reed</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza schoeniclus). Stigmella continuella (a species of moth occurring in southern and north-west England) has been observed in the area.|$|E
50|$|This area of {{open water}} and wet meadows has diverse bird life such as lapwings, kestrels, little egrets and <b>reed</b> <b>buntings,</b> and mammals include water voles and otters.|$|R
50|$|Paths {{run along}} the canal and through reedbeds. There is also {{grassland}} with tall herbs, and the canal bank has rare wetland flora. Birds include kingfishers and <b>reed</b> <b>buntings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The River Black Bourn {{runs through}} this large nature reserve, which has many bird species, such as barn owls, yellowhammers, linnets, <b>reed</b> <b>buntings</b> and skylarks. Plants in wet meadows include marsh orchids and marsh marigolds.|$|R
500|$|The {{canal and}} its environs are {{important}} for wildlife conservation. There are several Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which exhibit great biodiversity. Key sites that are home to several rare species include the Aldermaston Gravel Pits, Woolhampton, Thatcham Reed Beds, and Freeman's Marsh, Hungerford. There are also many non-statutory nature reserves along the canal. More than 100different species of bird have been recorded in surveys over {{the length of the}} canal, of which 38 could be classified as specialist waterway birds, including grey heron (Ardea cinerea), <b>reed</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza schoeniclus) and common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis). [...] Fourteenspecies have been confirmed as breeding including sand martins (Riparia riparia), which nest in drain-pipes in the brick walls of the canal in the centre of Reading. Wilton Water by Crofton Locks and the Kennet Valley gravel pits provide habitats for breeding and wintering waterfowl. Several species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and other invertebrates have also been recorded. Common reed (Phragmites australis) is among the plant species growing along the edges of the canal. Measures to preserve and create water vole (Arvicola amphibius or A. terrestrisis) habitat have had considerable impact on the restoration of the canal, and new [...] "vole-friendly" [...] techniques of bank protection have been developed.|$|E
