5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies {{available for the}} classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, human data were not deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further studies do not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. New studies include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Ranch Hand operation, which concluded that after 30 years the <b>results</b> <b>do</b> not provide evidence of disease.|$|E

25|$|In this {{instance}} the genetics {{appears to be}} simple: two alleles at a single locus, producing the three phenotypes. Total captures over 26 years 1939–64 came to 15,784 homozygous dominula (i.e. typica), 1,221 heterozygous medionigra and 28 homozygous bimacula. Now, assuming equal viability of the genotypes 1,209 heterozygotes would be expected, so the field <b>results</b> <b>do</b> not suggest any heterozygous advantage. It was Sheppard who found that the polymorphism is maintained by selective mating: each genotype preferentially mates with other morphs. This is sufficient to maintain the system {{despite the fact that}} in this case the heterozygote has slightly lower viability.|$|E
25|$|Other safety {{concerns}} about vaccines {{have been published}} on the Internet, in informal meetings, in books, and at symposia. These include hypotheses that vaccination can cause sudden infant death syndrome, epileptic seizures, allergies, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, as well as hypotheses that vaccinations can transmit bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis C virus, and HIV. These hypotheses have been investigated, with the conclusion that currently used vaccines meet high safety standards and that criticism of vaccine safety in the popular press is not justified. Large well-controlled epidemiologic {{studies have been conducted}} and the <b>results</b> <b>do</b> not support the hypothesis that vaccines cause chronic diseases. Furthermore, some vaccines are probably more likely to prevent or modify than cause or exacerbate autoimmune diseases.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which tools are integrated into the body schema are not fully understood. However, studies with long-term training have shown interesting phenomena. When wielding tools in both hands in a crossed posture, behavioral effects reverse {{in a similar way}} to when only hands are crossed. Thus, sensory stimuli are delivered the same way be it to the hands directly or indirectly via the tools. These studies suggest the mind incorporates the tools into the same or similar areas as it does the adjacent hands. Recent research into the short term plasticity of the body schema used individuals without any prior training with tools. These results, derived from the relation between afterimages and body schema, show that tools are incorporated into the body schema within seconds, regardless of length of training, though the <b>results</b> <b>do</b> not extend to other species besides humans.|$|E

25|$|Other {{drugs are}} {{prescribed}} off-label in the U.S., {{which means they}} have not been approved for treating ASD. Large placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine and aripiprazole were underway in early 2008. Aripiprazole may be effective for treating autism in the short term, but is also associated with side effects, such as weight gain and sedation. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and dopamine blockers can reduce some maladaptive behaviors associated with ASD. Although SSRIs reduce levels of repetitive behavior in autistic adults, a 2009 multisite randomized controlled study found no benefit and some adverse effects in children from the SSRI citalopram, raising doubts whether SSRIs are effective for treating repetitive behavior in autistic children. A further study of related medical reviews determined that the prescription of SSRI antidepressants for treating autistic spectrum disorders in children lacked any evidence, and could not be recommended. One study found that the psychostimulant methylphenidate was efficacious against hyperactivity associated with ASD, though with less response than in neurotypical children with ADHD. Of the many medications studied for treatment of aggressive and self-injurious behavior in children and adolescents with autism, only risperidone and methylphenidate demonstrate results that have been replicated. A 1998 study of the hormone secretin reported improved symptoms and generated tremendous interest, but several controlled studies since have found no benefit. Oxytocin {{may play a role in}} autism and may be an effective treatment for repetitive and affiliative behaviors; two related studies in adults found that oxytocin decreased repetitive behaviors and improved interpretation of emotions, but these preliminary <b>results</b> <b>do</b> not necessarily apply to children. An experimental drug STX107 has stopped overproduction of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in rodents, and it has been hypothesized that this may help in about 5% of autism cases, but this hypothesis has not been tested in humans.|$|E
500|$|Although Results May Vary {{received}} primarily negative reviews, {{according to}} Spin, the album [...] "isn't all that horrible".

The Sun-Sentinel gave Results May Vary a positive review, calling Lethal's work [...] "phenomenal", and praising [...] "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] and the soft-to-heavy progression of [...] "Build a Bridge". Steve Appleford of the Chicago Tribune gave Results May Vary a mixed review, writing: [...] "The music achieves some surprising sophistication with new textures both acoustic and electronic. Durst also is not so obnoxious nearly so often; at the same time, his songs too often lack the harsh melodic spark that once turned his ravings into pop hits".|$|E
500|$|In general, {{honeyeaters}} require extensive {{corridors of}} mature trees along their migratory routes, and flowering woodlands for nesting, {{so they are}} vulnerable {{to the effects of}} land clearing, grazing and weed infestation. The woodland habitat they prefer is considered an endangered ecological community. However, as it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the IUCN to be of least concern for conservation. A field experiment to determine whether yellow-faced honeyeater nests were less successful in fragmented habitats found nests closer to forest margins actually had a higher success rate than those deeper within the forest. While the yellow-faced honeyeater tends to nest away from the edge of forest remnants, experiments with natural and artificial nests at varying distances from the open areas showed no {{increase in the number of}} avian predators at the forest edge. The experiment <b>results</b> <b>do</b> not support the [...] "ecological trap" [...] and [...] "predator influx" [...] theories and contribute to a belief that fragmented habitats may not be as problematic as previously thought. In some areas the species is considered a pest because of its intrusion into orchards and urban gardens where it damages fruit.|$|E
