50|$|B2G {{networks}} {{provide a}} platform for businesses to bid on government opportunities which are presented as solicitations {{in the form of}} <b>request</b> <b>for</b> proposals (RFPs) in a reverse auction fashion. Public sector organizations (PSOs) generally post tenders in the form of RFPs, <b>request</b> <b>for</b> information (RFI), <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotations</b> (<b>RFQs),</b> Sources Sought and suppliers respond to them.|$|R
5000|$|The process usually {{starts with}} a demand or {{requirements}} - this could be for a physical part (inventory) or a service. [...] A requisition is generated, which details the requirements (in some cases providing a requirements specification) which actions the procurement department. A <b>request</b> <b>for</b> proposal (RFP) or <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotation</b> (<b>RFQ)</b> is then raised. Suppliers send their quotations {{in response to the}} RFQ, and a review is undertaken where the best offer (typically based on price, availability and quality) is given the purchase order.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Quotation</b> (<b>RFQ)</b> is {{used when}} discussions with bidders are not {{required}} (mainly when the specifications of a product or service are already known) and when price is the main or only factor in selecting the successful bidder. An RFQ may also be used prior to issuing a full-blown RFP to determine general price ranges. In this scenario, products, services or suppliers may be selected from the RFQ results to bring in to further research in order to write a more fully fleshed out RFP.|$|R
50|$|An RFI is {{primarily}} used {{to gather information}} to help {{make a decision on}} what steps to take next. RFIs are therefore seldom the final stage and are instead often used in combination with the following: <b>request</b> <b>for</b> proposal (RFP), <b>request</b> <b>for</b> tender (RFT), and <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotation</b> (<b>RFQ).</b> In addition to gathering basic information, an RFI is often used as a solicitation sent to a broad base of potential suppliers for the purpose of conditioning suppliers' minds, developing strategy, building a database, and preparing for an RFP, RFT, or RFQ.|$|R

40|$|Lean {{thinking}} {{promotes a}} new vision of habitual processes in order to highlight the hidden obstacles that preclude {{the achievement of the}} best performance. Typically, most of the enterprise's processes are currently revised according to the lean thinking perspective and, because of its holistic approach, the analysis also includes the relationships of processes operating along the whole product lifecycle. In this paper one of these processes - the <b>Request</b> <b>For</b> <b>Quotation</b> (<b>RFQ)</b> - {{and its impact on the}} enterprise's overall performance, is analysed. The <b>Request</b> <b>For</b> <b>Quotation</b> is understood as a sequence of activities that companies perform in the initial phase of each project where customer needs are analysed in order to make a proposal that contains both economic and schedule items. The quotation has to be conform with the product specifications and requirements for which the company has been consulted; additionally, it has to be competitive and made in a short time.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of this document, the {{following}} definitions apply: 2. 1 (a) “Request <b>for</b> Information”: A <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> Information (RFI) is used on high value and/or complex purchases to identify the interest of potentially qualified suppliers in the marketplace and/or for budgetary pricing. An RFI does not form a contractual commitment. No award results from an RFI. An RFI may lead to an RFP. (b) “Request <b>for</b> Proposal”: A <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> Proposal (RFP) is a competitive bid process that is undertaken typically for higher dollar value and/or complex transactions where factors in addition to price will be used to make the final purchasing decision, e. g. qualifications, experience, etc. It identifies goods, services or research objectives with mandatory and optional requirements and may be linked to a previously issued <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> Information (RFI). An RFP is normally awarded based on a weighting of evaluation criteria, including price. (c) “Request <b>for</b> Quotation”: A <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Quotation</b> (<b>RFQ)</b> is a competitive bid process that is undertaken typically for transactions where price is the key factor in the purchasing decision.

50|$|EDI {{documents}} generally {{contain the}} same information that would normally {{be found in a}} paper document used for the same organizational function. For example, an EDI 940 ship-from-warehouse order is used by a manufacturer to tell a warehouse to ship product to a retailer. It typically has a 'ship-to' address, a 'bill-to' address, and a list of product numbers (usually a UPC) and quantities. Another example is the set of messages between sellers and buyers, such as <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotation</b> (<b>RFQ),</b> bid in response to RFQ, purchase order, purchase order acknowledgement, shipping notice, receiving advice, invoice, and payment advice. However, EDI is not confined to just business data related to trade but encompasses all fields such as medicine (e.g., patient records and laboratory results), transport (e.g., container and modal information), engineering and construction, etc. In some cases, EDI will be used to create a new business information flow (that was not a paper flow before). This is the case in the Advanced Shipment Notification (ASN) which was designed to inform the receiver of a shipment, the goods to be received and how the goods are packaged.|$|R
5000|$|By mid-1968, Taylor had {{prepared}} a complete {{plan for a}} computer network, and, after ARPA's approval, a <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Quotation</b> (<b>RFQ)</b> was issued <b>for</b> 140 potential bidders. Most computer science companies regarded the ARPA-Taylor proposal as outlandish, and only twelve submitted bids to build a network; of the twelve, ARPA regarded only four as top-rank contractors. At year's end, ARPA considered only two contractors, and awarded the contract to build the network to BBN Technologies on 7 April 1969.The initial, seven-person BBN team were much aided by the technical specificity of their response to the ARPA RFQ, and thus quickly produced the first working system. This team was led by Frank Heart. The BBN-proposed network closely followed Taylor's ARPA plan: a network composed of small computers called Interface Message Processors (or IMPs), similar to the later concept of routers, that functioned as gateways interconnecting local resources. At each site, the IMPs performed store-and-forward packet switching functions, and were interconnected with leased lines via telecommunication data sets (modems), with initial data rates of [...] The host computers were connected to the IMPs via custom serial communication interfaces. The system, including the hardware and the packet switching software, was designed and installed in nine months.|$|R
5000|$|Taylor {{hoped to}} build a {{computer}} network to connect the ARPA-sponsored projects together, if nothing else, to let him communicate {{to all of them}} through one terminal. Sutherland returned to a teaching position, and by June 1966 Taylor was officially director of Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) where he directed the ARPANET project until 1969. Taylor had convinced ARPA's Director Charles M. Herzfeld to fund a network project earlier in February 1966, and Herzfeld transferred a million dollars from a ballistic missile defense program to Taylor's budget. [...] Taylor hired Lawrence G. Roberts from MIT Lincoln Laboratory to be its first program manager. Roberts first resisted moving to Washington DC, until Herzfeld reminded the director of Lincoln Laboratory that ARPA dominated its funding. Licklider continued to provide guidance, and Wesley A. Clark suggested the use of a dedicated computer, called the Interface Message Processor at each node of the network instead of centralized control. ARPA issued a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotation</b> (<b>RFQ)</b> to build the system, which was awarded to Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN). ATT Bell Labs and IBM Research were invited to join, but were not interested. At a pivotal meeting in 1967 most participants resisted testing the new network; they thought it would slow down their research.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to reflect the importance of supplier evaluation process, analyzing criteria {{that can be used}} to determinate the best supplier and developing different methods that help to make this decision. The market is changing and supplier selection approach has evolved from multiple suppliers to single supplier approach. In the past, the traditional approach used to consider multiple suppliers and one main criterion, the price. However, the market has moved towards contracting a single supplier selected by means of a multiple criteria. In 1960, Dickson created an exhaustive criteria list, which has been the reference for decades as the criteria to evaluate suppliers. This project has investigated the work carried out not only by Dickson but also by different authors that progressed in this area later on. Based on the research carried out, a new list has been developed. According to this investigation, quality, delivery, service and cost are the four most important criteria to evaluate suppliers. Furthermore, this investigation has identified that multi-criteria approach has some problems, since it is not easy to evaluate some of the criteria and sometimes they contradict each other. Therefore it is essential to record in advance what the company is looking for, and what the importance of each of the requirements is. Supplier selection process, which is described in Section 2, starts with the evaluation of the company needs, development of the requirements and selection criteria. Then, a market survey is carried out to identify a limited numbers of suppliers which will participate in the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotation</b> (<b>RFQ.)</b> Once the bids are received, they are evaluated involving all company’s stakeholders. Finally, one or more companies are awarded as suppliers based on the final result. Section 3 depicts the evaluation criteria. There are plenty of methods to make the selection. This dissertation has focused on the following methods: Analytical Hierarchic Process (AHP), Analytic Network Process (ANP), Techniques for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Decision-Matrix Method. All of them are described in Section 4. Besides to explain the main important concept of each method, the methodology and the advantages and limitations, a review of authors, who propose extensions of this method, is carried out. Additionally this section includes a summary that was developed to include other existing methods for supplier evaluation. Finally, Section 5 provides a practical approach of these concepts, analyzing an existing real case of supplier selection in a successful energy sector company. It describes the company´s supplier selection process, the main criteria that are considered and an example of the technical evaluation of metallic structures to know with more detail tools that are used for that company.
