They do not permit an American to buy a [...] vessel abroad and sail it under our flag without paying enormous [...] duties; a provision which is intended to foster ship-building in [...] the United States. Even with this legislation, ships, as a fact, [...] are not built here for the foreign trade; and our ship-builders [...] practically supply the coasting-trade only (which is not open to [...] foreigners). The ability to buy ships anywhere, and enter them to [...] registry under our flag free of duty, is {{what is meant by}} the [...] demand for “free ships.” This, however, has to do with [...] ship-building. But ship-owning or ship-sailing, is quite distinct [...] from it. The ability to get as great a <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>capital</b> and [...] labor invested in a ship as from other occupations open to [...] Americans is another thing. Even if we had “free ships,” the [...] higher returns in other industries in our country, particularly as [...] regards profits, might cause capitalists naturally to neglect a [...] less for a more productive business. In 1884 Congress has very [...] properly taken away many vexatious restrictions upon ships, which [...] diminished the returns from ship-sailing, and it remains to be [...] seen whether we can thereby regain any of our foreign [...] carrying-trade. At present we have a very small tonnage even in [...] that part of the shipping engaged in carrying our own goods.|$|E

We find significant differences between developed and developing countries {{with respect to their}} structure of <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> <b>capital</b> investments. For the developed countries in the sample, <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> IT <b>capital</b> investments are estimated to be positive and significant, while <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> non-IT <b>capital</b> investments are not commensurate with relative factor shares. The situation is reversed for the developing countries subsample, where <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> non-IT <b>capital</b> are quite substantial, but those <b>from</b> IT <b>capital</b> investments are not statistically significant. We estimate output growth contributions of IT and non-IT capital and discuss the contrasting policy implications for capital investment by developed and developing economies. information technology, international, productivity paradox, capital investment, information technology investment...|$|R

We show that under the balanced-budget rule, the contribution of public investment to future output {{plays a key role}} in determining its effects on macroeconomic performance. When policymakers resort to debt issue in financing expenditures, the attractiveness of public investment crucially depends on the <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>capital</b> spending relative to the cost of public borrowing. We also consider the case of a capital borrowing rule where only public investment could be financed by additional borrowing and find similar results. Our findings point to the key role of the quality of public investment in its impact on macroeconomic outcome and highlight the importance of efficient mechanisms for selection, implementation and monitoring of public investment projects in both developed and developing countries. macroeconomic performance; public debt; public investment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the risk and}} return of the so-called capital structure arbitrage, which exploits the mispricing between a companys debt and equity. SpeciÞcally, a structural model connects a companys equity price with its credit default swap (CDS) spread. Based on the deviation of CDS market quotes from their theoretical counterparts, a convergence-type trading strategy is proposed and analyzed using 4, 044 daily CDS spreads on 33 obligors. We Þnd that capital structure arbitrage can be an attractive investment strategy, but {{is not without its}} risk. In particular, the risk arises when the arbitrageur shorts CDS and the market spread subsequently skyrockets, resulting in market closure and forcing the arbitrageur into liquidation. We present preliminary evidence that the monthly <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>capital</b> structure arbitrage is related to the corporate bond market return and a hedge fund return index on Þxed income arbitrage. Capital structure arbitrage has lately become popular among hedge funds and bank proprietary trading desks. Some traders have even touted it as the next big thing or the hottest strategy in the arbitrage community.

40|$|The {{economic}} reforms introduced in India from 1991 involved two aspects for the corporate sector: first, a physical one implying enhanced freedom {{to produce and}} trade, and second, financial, having access to more avenues of finance both domestically and globally. Industry and exports grew rapidly after reforms but growth slowed {{in the last two}} years. The study examines the contours of corporate response to reforms based on representative samples of private companies for the period 1991 - 97. The study finds evidence of shifts in the pattern of finance to take advantage from the emergence of new cheaper sources of funds, large benefits from tax policy changes and limited cost reductions. The private corporate sector has built up large productive capacity during the post-reform period, and while capacity utilisation has gradually improved, there exists large underutilised capacity particularly in intermediate and capital goods. Size-wise analysis indicates that the response from large firms has been the fastest but the <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>capital</b> employed of those firms has been the lowest. The study also brings out the increasing outward orientation of private firms with export intensity of sales overtaking the import intensity during the post-reform period. Finally, the paper notes a slowdown towards the last year of the study and points to the need for a fresh round of remorms to rejuvenate the corporate sector...|$|E

After stagnating during the crisis-ridden year 2009, premiums displayed growth in 2010 that did not keep up with the expansion of nominal GDP. Accordingly, insurance market penetration in 2010 dropped below the value of the previous year. For 2011, the industry expects a slight decline in premium dynamics.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the changing fiscal role of the federal government with respect to providing financial support for low-income households and the taxation of <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> <b>capital.</b> Specifically, the effects of reducing transfers to low income families by US$ 10 billion and balancing the ensuing federal budget surplus by increasing the preferential tax treatment of capital gains for individual taxpayers are examined. We examine how this combined budget-neutral fiscal policy change affects agricultural production, economy-wide welfare and the consumption of food. Our results indicate reducing the distortion between the taxation of capital and labour increases economy-wide efficiency leading to increased consumption of food by all income classes. Although economy-wide food expenditures increase, offsetting the revenue shortfall <b>from</b> a reduced <b>capital</b> tax by decreasing transfers to low income families reduces food expenditures for the two lowest income groups by nearly US$ 1 billion. ...|$|R

30|$|The market {{transition}} {{has been}} the focus of theoretical debates and empirical investigations regarding income distribution in China. According to market transition theory (Nee 1989), due to systematic differences in income determination between a market economy and a redistributive economy, marketization will necessarily increase income <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> human <b>capital</b> and depreciate the value of political capital at the same time. Following this proposition, many studies have focused on the diversifying effect of market reform on individual income under the framework of state vs. market (Bian and Logan 1996; Zhou 2000). These studies show that the income distribution system varies over time and has substantial between-sector differences. Although marketization leads to significant increase of income <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> human <b>capital,</b> political capital remains an important determinant of income in China, especially within state-owned sector (Zang 2002; Zhou 2000). Compared with state-owned sector, human capital receives higher rewards from the private sector. Nonetheless, the pace of income growth has been very rapid in state-owned sector in recent years, which has regained its earnings advantage over the private sector (Bian and Zhang 2002).|$|R

The behavioral part try to reveal differences between local (Norwegian) and foreign (non-Norwegian) investors in light of home bias. We find that 94 per cent of the mutual funds {{are not expected to}} generate a significant positive alpha, excluding transaction costs. After deducting <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> <b>capital</b> assets, illustrations find that foreigners have more volatile cash flows than locals. We test if these differences are due to irrational biases, different risk profiles or information advantages. We provide significant evidence that three month average historic returns can predict larger changes in foreign capital assets than in local, which indicates that foreigners chase performance more than locals. Furthermore, we find that changes in foreign capital assets predict three- and six month average return better than locals, hence we can exclude the irrational bias story. Finally, after controlling for risk, we find significant positive alpha for foreigners and no significant results for locals, which exclude the different risk profile story. Overall, this suggests that foreign investors generate positive return because they have an information advantage...|$|R

The model demonstrates that when <b>returns</b> <b>from</b> financial <b>capital</b> markets increase, fertility levels and investment in children's schooling are reduced, but child labour levels increase.

In particular if there is a child labour market, fertility decisions are determined mainly by the child wage rate and child rearing costs.
