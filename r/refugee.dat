A Canadian government survey found that over 70% of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees {{have gone back to}} Sri Lanka for holidays raising concerns over the legitimacy of their <b>refugee</b> claims.|$|E

40|$|While the Syrian <b>refugees</b> {{crisis has}} {{increasingly}} continued its effect in both Turkey and other neighboring countries and European countries {{for more than}} five years, <b>refugees</b> do not adapt themselves to society in country of asylum, and are exposed to social exclusion. The purpose of the study is to explore social representations of social media users toward Syrian <b>refugees</b> in Turkey with a qualitative approach; because social representations may indicate the problems in the integration process of Syrian <b>refugees</b> and Turkish society, and the reasons of social exclusion toward Syrian <b>refugees.</b> Accordingly 98 entries, which were taken from frequently used social dictionaries in Turkey, were evaluated by researchers and seven thematic units were formed. Thematic units reflect (i) perceived negative features of Syrian <b>refugees,</b> (ii) perceived threats in Turkey due to Syrian <b>refugees,</b> (iii) criticisms toward Syrian <b>refugees</b> policy of Turkish government, (iv) positive attitudes toward Syrian <b>refugees,</b> (v) perceived political importance of Syrian <b>refugees,</b> (vi) proposed solutions toward perceived Syrian <b>refugees</b> problem, and (vii) other criticisms toward Syrian <b>refugees</b> issue.

40|$|Each year, <b>refugees</b> {{are forced}} {{to leave their homes}} and country due to result of wars or {{political}} turmoil.

The <b>refugees</b> speak several different African dialects, with few African <b>refugees</b> who speak English.

5|$|The first Vietnamese <b>refugee</b> {{camp was}} opened in Pulau Bidong in August 1978 with United Nations assistance; the island {{accommodated}} up to 25,000 refugees. Other <b>refugee</b> camps {{were set up}} at Pulau Tengah, Pulau Besar, Kota Bharu, Kuantan, Sarawak and Sabah. In 1982, a transit centre was established at Sungei Besi, where refugees awaiting deportation to Western countries that were willing to accept them would be housed. The number of Vietnamese <b>refugee</b> arrivals fluctuated between 1981 and 1983, before a period of significant decrease from 1984 to 1986. In 1987, Malaysia and other neighbouring countries saw a sudden {{increase in the number}} of Vietnamese refugees landing in Malaysia. At an ASEAN summit in June 1987, member countries chastised the Vietnamese government for not having sufficiently addressed the <b>refugee</b> problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{implementation}} of stringent rules that require Vietnamese arrivals {{to qualify for}} <b>refugee</b> status prompted {{some of them to}} opt for the voluntary repatriation programme; between 1,000 and 2,000 arrivals to Malaysia returned to Vietnam in 1989. Refugees who opted to return to Vietnam were provided with a monthly stipend for up to one year by the UNHCR. In the early 1990s, as Vietnam began to experience economic growth, the number of <b>refugee</b> arrivals to Malaysia dropped. Joint collaborations between Malaysia, Vietnam and UNHCR to address the problem enabled Malaysia {{to reduce the size of}} its Vietnamese <b>refugee</b> populace, facilitating the closure of the Pulau Bidong <b>refugee</b> camp in November 1991. 3,000 Vietnamese refugees participated in the voluntary repatriation programme, and Malaysia's <b>refugee</b> populace reduced to 6,000 by 1994. Most of the remaining arrivals were not able to pass the UNHCR screening process and were classified as illegal immigrants. The majority of them expressed their reluctance to be repatriated to Vietnam; demonstrations and rioting broke out when news of the camp's impending closure was announced in 1995. Sungei Besi <b>refugee</b> camp was later closed in June 1996. The last refugees returned to Vietnam in 2005.|$|E
