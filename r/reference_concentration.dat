Data from 319 sites monitored by the So Paulo State Environmental Company (2005 to 2009) and from the 22 Water Resources Management Units in So Paulo State were assessed (N = 27, 131). We verified that data from different management units dominated by similar land cover could be analyzed together (Analysis of Variance, P = 0. 504). Cumulative frequency diagrams showed that industrialized management units were characterized by the worst water quality (e. g. average TP of 0. 51 mg/L), followed by agricultural watersheds.

Inside the surf zone, vortices induced by breaking waves and bores are the main mechanism for sediment resuspension; this process dominates over bottom boundary layer processes. Time-averaged <b>reference</b> <b>concentration,</b> defined as the ssc at 3. 5 cm above the bed, does not correlate with bottom-induced shear stress or predicted ripple steepness.

Tidal currents were just able to suspend sand at the bed at peak spring tide but most {{suspension and}} transport occurred {{as a result of the}} combination of waves and currents. Burst-average (17 min) sand concentration profiles (C¯-profiles) from an acoustic backscatter instrument were used to define the (varying) location of the sea-bed, following the method used by Green et al. [Green, M. O., Dolphin, T. J., Swales, A., Vincent, C. E., 1999. Transport of mixed-size sediments in a tidal channel. Coastal Sediments ' 99, edited by N. C. Kraus, and W. G. McDougal, ASCE, Long Island, New York, pp. 644 - 658]. Reference concentrations at the sea-bed (C 0) and at 1 cm (C 1) were examined in relation to both the hydrodynamic conditions and the type of bed forms present. The C 0 predictive equations of Green and Black [Green, M. O., Black, K. P., Suspended sediment <b>reference</b> <b>concentration</b> under waves: field measurements and critical analysis of two predictive models, Coastal Engineering, 38, 115 - 141, 1999](short-wave ripples) and Nielsen [Nielsen, P., Suspended sediment concentrations under waves, Coastal Engineering, 10, 23 - 31, 1986](all bed forms; includes ripple steepness), both of which require knowledge of the bed-form type, were not as successful in explaining the variance in our C 0 data as a regression of C 0 against the skin-friction Shields parameter ?'cw that ignored bed-form type (73 % of variance explained). The values of the <b>reference</b> <b>concentration</b> C 1 were compared with the Lee et al. [Lee, G. -H., Dade, W. B., Friedrichs, C. T., Vincent, C. E., Examination of <b>Reference</b> <b>Concentration</b> Under Waves and Currents on the Inner Shelf., Journal of Geophysical Research, 109, 1 - 10, 2004] equation which predicts C 1 from the product of the Shields parameter and the inverse Rouse parameter; 51 % of the variance in C 1 was explained. The shapes of the C¯-profiles were very variable as reported by Dolphin et al. [Dolphin, T. J., Grasmeijer, B. T.,Vincent, C. E., Sand suspension due to waves and tidal flow over short and long-wave ripples and flat beds on the Dutch Coast, in Sand Transport and Morphology of Offshore Mining Pits, edited by L. C. van Rijn, R. L. Soulsby, P. Hoekstra, and A. G. Davies, Aqua Publications, Amersfoort, The Netherlands, 2005. ], particularly over larger and steeper bed forms when the position of the measurements in relation to the bed-form geometry became important. However, a Rouse-shaped profile (in which the sediment diffusivity increases linearly with height) could be fitted (R 2 > 95 %) to the lowest 0. 2 m of 89 % of the suspended sand profiles. The apparent separation of C¯-profiles, when grouped by bed-form type, is due to the variation in the <b>reference</b> <b>concentration</b> and not to the dependence on the friction velocity, which shows large scatter and no systematic variation with bed-form type. It is concluded that, for most practical applications, <b>reference</b> <b>concentration</b> at 1 cm can be predicted by Lee et al. [Lee, G. -H., Dade, W. B., Friedrichs, C. T., Vincent, C. E., 2004.

Using a model of V 2 O 33 + in equilibrium with VO 2 + and VO 2 +, the spectra were characterized in terms of an excess absorbance parameter p and the molar extinction coefficients epsilon(4) and epsilon(5) of VO 2 + and VO 2 +, respectively. The results showed that p varies weakly with the vanadium concentration C and this variation was quantified relative to a <b>reference</b> <b>concentration</b> C-r by means of a concentration coefficient phi(r). Experimental data showed that plots of fr versus C phi(r) and plots of 1 /phi(r) versus C are linear and, based on this linearity, phi(r) was expressed as a simple function of C in terms of its <b>reference</b> <b>concentration</b> C-r and a single parameter M that is independent of the choice of C-r.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this study is: investigation of the influence of{{the composition of the}} bed material on the composition of the suspended material at the reference level and on calculating the <b>reference</b> <b>concentration,</b> based on recent measurements. This objective was achieved by a study of literature, the investigation of data from six measurements and by the use of the Van Rijn-formula for the <b>reference</b> <b>concentration.</b> A method to calculate the suspended sediment transport rate is integrating the product of the vertical velocity profile and the time and bed-averaged vertical concentration profile. Most of the expressions for the time-averaged concentration profile have as input parameter, besides many other parameters, the median bed particle size dso and do therefore, pure theoretically considered, only fit for perfectly uniform bed material. A possible grading of the bed material, which will normally be found in nature, is not taken into account. Two calculation-possibilities to take the grading into account are the d-method and the fraction-method. The measured data, on which this study is based, come from the results of experiments carried out by Jacobs and Dekker (2000). The main conditions which are used in this study are a constant significant wave height H and peak period Tp and a varying depth-averaged current velocity. Two types of bed material are used in this study: uniform and graded bed material. Using the particle diameters dso (= ds) and d 90 of the bed material as input parameters in the Van Rijn-formula gives in all considered cases an underestimation of the actual (measured) <b>reference</b> <b>concentration.</b> The outcome of the Van Rijn-formula can also be multiplied with a factor to repair the gap between the actual (measured) concentrations and the calculated concentrations. This factor is 1. 70 in case of the uniform bed material and 1. 90 in case of the graded bed material. The situation with waves only and uniform material seems to need a higher factor (ca. 6. 3).

By dividing our dataset into thirds we presented trophic state boundaries and frequency curves for the nutrient levels in water bodies with different enrichment conditions. TP and TN baseline concentrations (0. 010 mg/L and 0. 350 mg/L, respectively) were bracketed by ranges for temperate reservoirs available in the literature. We propose trophic state boundaries (upper limits for the oligotrophic category: 0. 010 mg TP/L, 0. 460 mg TN/L and 1. 7 mu g Chl a/L; for the mesotrophic: 0. 030 mg TP/L, 0. 820 mg TN/L and 9. 0 mu g Chl a/L). Through an example with a different dataset (from the Itupararanga Reservoir, Brazil), we encouraged the use of frequency curves to compare data from individual monitoring efforts with the expected concentrations in oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic regional systems. Such analysis might help designing recovery programs to reach targeted concentrations and mitigate the undesirable eutrophication symptoms in subtropical freshwaters.
