40|$|Inconel 718 {{is widely}} used in the {{aerospace}} industries due to its high temperature endurance properties and good corrosion resistance. However, the machining of Inconel 718 generates more heat in the cutting zone than that of most other materials, which makes this material prone to surface defects. Among several possible surface defects, the chip <b>rebonding</b> phenomenon is investigated in this study. To avoid this defect and achieve a high surface quality, {{it is necessary to}} understand the mechanism of chip <b>rebonding.</b> In order to identify the root causes of chip <b>rebonding</b> in turning Inconel 718, chip <b>rebonding</b> samples are observed. Overall observations of the machined surface show that chip <b>rebonding</b> occurs periodically along a feed mark, and that the chip’s side edge is periodically torn and curled. On the basis of the observations, the torn chips at the side edge of the chip are assumed to be smeared periodically by the tool along the feed mark. A chip curl blocking device is designed to test this hypothesis and the test results with the chip curl blocking device are shown. Residual stress distribution, which is important for material life, is affected by chip <b>rebonding.</b> To evaluate the chip <b>rebonding</b> effect on residual stresses, a FE model is developed to simulate the chip <b>rebonding</b> phenomenon. The changes of residual stress distribution in subsurface material are simulated while chip <b>rebonding</b> occurs and after the material cools down. Subsurface residual stresses are measured by the nanoindentation method and compared with simulation results. In order to identify the key variables that influence the occurrence of chip <b>rebonding,</b> a parametric study is performed in dry and wet cutting conditions. DOE is carried out to study the effect of each cutting parameter on chip <b>rebonding</b> in dry cutting. In wet cutting, various MWFs including pure water and two kinds of commercial lubricants in varying concentrations and viscosity are used to investigate their effect on chip <b>rebonding</b> occurrence. This dissertation research provides an in-depth understanding of the chip <b>rebonding</b> phenomenon in turning of Inconel 718 and a method to control the machining conditions to avoid chip <b>rebonding...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the impact of different enamel preparation procedures and compare light cure composite (LCC) and resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI) on the bond strength of orthodontic metal tubes <b>rebonded</b> to the enamel. Twenty human molars were divided into two groups (n= 10). Tubes were bonded using LCC (Transbond XT) in group 1 and RMGI (Fuji Ortho LC) in group 2. The tubes in each group were bonded following manufacturers’ instructions (experiment I) and then debonded using testing machine. Then, the same brackets were sandblasted and <b>rebonded</b> twice. Before the first <b>rebonding,</b> the enamel was cleaned using carbide bur (experiment II) and before second <b>rebonding,</b> it was cleaned using carbide bur and soda blasted (experiment III). Mann–Whitney and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed no significant difference between RMGI and LCC bond strengths in case of normal bonding and <b>rebonding,</b> when enamel was cleaned using carbide bur before <b>rebonding.</b> Enamel soda blasting before <b>rebonding</b> significantly increased RMGI tensile bond strength value compared to LLC (p< 0. 05).

Teeth in four groups (n= 10) were etched, a small amount of resin composite was bonded and debonded, then specimens in three groups were ground for different lengths of time (10 [*]s, 20 [*]s, 30 [*]s) to remove an increasing amount of enamel, one group was left untouched. The teeth were bonded again and the bond strengths of 1 st and 2 nd bonding were compared and analysed against the amount of enamel loss in different groups (7 [*]µm (± 2); 12 [*]µm (± 1); 16 [*]µm (± 3)). Specimens were examined with SEM and by noncontacting optical profilometer. Results.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty debonded metal and 20 debonded ceramic brackets were randomly assigned to receive one of the following surface treatments (n= 10 for each group) : (1) sandblasting (control); (2) tribochemical silica coating combined with silane. Brackets were <b>rebonded</b> to the enamel surface on the labial and lingual sides of premolars with a light-polymerized resin composite. All specimens were stored in distilled water for 1 week and then thermocycled (5, 000 cycles) between 5 - 55 ºC. Shear bond strength values were measured using a universal testing machine. Student's t-test was used to compare the data (&# 945;= 0. 05). Failure mode was assessed using a stereomicroscope, and the treated and non-treated bracket surfaces were observed by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: <b>Rebonded</b> ceramic brackets treated with silica coating followed by silanization had significantly greater bond strength values (17. 7 ± 4. 4 MPa) than the sandblasting group (2. 4 ± 0. 8 MPa, P< 0. 001). No significant difference was observed between the <b>rebonded</b> metal brackets treated with silica coating with silanization (15 ± 3. 9 MPa) and the sandblasted brackets (13. 6 ± 3. 9 MPa). Treated <b>rebonded</b> ceramic specimens primarily exhibited cohesive failure in resin and adhesive failure at the enamel-adhesive interface.

5000|$|In 1934, Egon Orowan, Michael Polanyi and G. I. Taylor, almost {{simultaneously}} {{realized that}} plastic deformation {{could be explained}} in terms of the theory of dislocations. Dislocations can move if the atoms from one of the surrounding planes break their bonds and <b>rebond</b> with the atoms at the terminating edge. In effect, a half plane of atoms is moved in response to shear stress by breaking and reforming a line of bonds, one (or a few) at a time. The energy required to break a single bond is far less than that required to break all the bonds on an entire plane of atoms at once. Even this simple model of the force required to move a dislocation shows that plasticity is possible at much lower stresses than in a perfect crystal. In many materials, particularly ductile materials, dislocations are the [...] "carrier" [...] of plastic deformation, and the energy required to move them is less than the energy required to fracture the material. Dislocations give rise to the characteristic malleability of metals.|$|E

The aim of the present study was to quantitatively compare clinical survival of <b>rebonded</b> brackets with different ARI scores with new brackets <b>rebonding.</b> Materials and Methods: The subjects in the present study consisted of 74 patients with 76 debonded brackets on maxillary first and second premolars. After refreshing the bracket base of the debonded brackets, they were assigned in two groups: group A with 27 brackets of ARI≥ 4 and group B with 28 brackets of ARI≤ 2. In 21 cases, new brackets were used (group C). The frequency of the debonding in each <b>rebonded</b> group during treatment was calculated in intervals of 6, 12, 18 mounths after onset of bracket <b>rebonding.</b> Chi-squared test was used to compare the frequency of debonded brackets. Results: The frequency of debonded brackets was significantly higher in group B (ARI≤ 2) than those of groups A (ARI≥ 4) and C (new brackets). The number of debonded brackets were not significantly different between groups A (ARI≥ 4) and C (new brackets).

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the <b>rebonding</b> effect on microleakage of class V composite restorations using two low viscosity resins. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, 60 class V composite restorations were performed in buccal and lingual surfaces of human extracted premolars with the occlusal margin in enamel and the gingival margin in dentin/cementum. The teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups: (I) restorations with no <b>rebonding,</b> (II) restoration margins <b>rebonded</b> with an enamel adhesive (Margin Bond), (III) restoration margins <b>rebonded</b> with a specific unfilled resin. The specimens were then thermocycled and immersed in 0. 5 % fuchsin dye solution. The samples were sectioned longitudinally and observed under a stereomicroscope for assessment of microleakage. The data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests. P< 0. 05 was considered as the level of significance. Results: Statistical analysis showed a significant difference in the microleakage of gingival margins (P< 0. 0001), but not in enamel margins (P= 0. 148). Microleakage at the gingival margins of group (III) was significantly less than that of group (II). Group (I) showed the highest amount of microleakage.

5000|$|Eggs {{function}} as emulsifiers, foaming agents, and tenderizers in the dough. The egg white proteins, mainly Ovulblumins, “{{function as}} structure formers. Egg solids, chiefly the egg white solids {{combined with the}} moisture in the egg, are considered structure-forming materials that help significantly to produce proper volume, grain, and texture.” The egg yolk contributes proteins, fats, and emulsifiers to the dough. Emulsifying agents are essential to doughnut formation because they prevent the fat molecules from separating from the water molecules in the dough. The main emulsifier in egg yolk is called lecithin, which is a phospholipid. “The fatty acids are attracted to fats and oils (lipids) in food, while the phosphate group is attracted to water. It is this ability to attract both lipids and water that allow phospholipids such as lecithin to act as emulsifiers.” The proteins from both the egg yolk and the egg whites contribute {{to the structure of}} the dough through a process called coagulation. When heat is applied to the dough, the egg proteins will begin to unfold, or denature, and then form new bonds with one another, thus creating a gel-like network that can hold water and gas.Shortening is responsible for providing tenderness and aerating the dough. In terms of its molecular structure, “a typical shortening that appears solid room temperature contains 15-20% solids and, hence, 80-85% liquid oil…this small amount of solids can be made to hold all of the liquid in a matrix of very small, stable, needlelike crystals (beta-prime crystals).” This crystalline structure is considered highly stable due to how tightly its molecules are packed. The sugar used in baking is essentially sucrose, and besides imparting sweetness in the doughnut, sugar also functions in the color and tenderness of the final product. Sucrose is a simple carbohydrate whose structure is made up of a glucose molecule bound to a fructose molecule. Milk is utilized in the making of doughnuts, but in large scale bakeries, one form of milk used is nonfat dry milk solids. These solids are obtained by removing most of the water from skim milk with heat, and this heat additionally denatures the whey proteins and increases the absorption properties of the remaining proteins. The ability of the casein and whey proteins to absorb excess water is essential to prolonging the doughnut's freshness. The major whey protein in the nonfat milk solids is known as beta-lactoglobulin, and a crucial feature of its structure is that there exists a single sulfhydryl group that is protected by the alpha helix, and when heating of the milk solids occurs, these groups participate in disulfide exchanges with other molecules. This interchange prevents the renaturation of the whey proteins. [...] If the crosslinking of the sulfide groups does not occur, the whey proteins can <b>rebond</b> and weaken the gluten network.|$|E

The treated brackets were rebonded to the new premolars in the same manner as the first-stage experiment.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the influence of <b>rebonding</b> and bleaching on the release of metallic ions and microstractures of admixed and spherical amalgams. Materials and Methods: This experimental in vitro study was performed on 96 Class V cavities (3. 5 mm in length, 2 mm in width and depth) prepared on sound human premolars and restored with amalgams containing spherical and admixed particles. In half of the samples of each amalgam type <b>rebonding</b> procedure was carried out with Scotchbond Multi-purpose adhesive system and Guardian Seal resin sealant. Then half of the amalgam restorations, with or without <b>rebonding,</b> were exposed to 30 % carbamide peroxide (n = 12). The amount of metallic ions released from amalgams was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Surface topography and compositions of two samples in each group were observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Data were analyzed by t-test and multivariate ANOVA (α = 0. 05). Results: 30 % carbamide peroxide gel caused a significant increase in Hg released from amalgams in non-rebonded groups (p value < 0. 001). There was no significant difference in ion release from spherical and admixed amalgams (p value = 0. 73). <b>Rebonding</b> resulted in significant reduction in Hg release (p value = 0. 007).

Their major advantage is the short time of the <b>rebond</b> mixing cycle. Until now, no complete theoretical description {{of the process of}} mixing in turbine mixers has been offered. Neither does it seem reasonable to try to adapt the theoretical backgrounds of the mixing process carried out in mixers of other types, for example, rooler mixers [1], to the description of operation of the turbine mixers. Truly one can risk the statement that the individual fundamental operations of mixing in rooler mixers, like kneading, grinding, mixing and thinning, are also performed in turbine mixers. Yet, even if so, in turbine mixers these processes are proceeding at a rate and intensity different than in the roller mixers. The fact should also be recalled that the theoretical backgrounds usually relate to the preparation of sand mixtures from new components, and this considerably restricts the field of application of these descriptions when referred to <b>rebond</b> mixing of the system sand. The fundamentals of the process of the synthetic sand rebonding with bentonite require determination and description of operations, like disaggregation, even distribution of binder and water within the entire volume of the rebonded sand batch, sand grains coating, binder activation and aeration.

Microleakage was graded (0 - 3) using a stereomicroscope at X 40 magnification. Data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon pair wise statistical tests. P&lt; 0. 05 was considered as the limit of significance. Results: The groups lined with SBMP showed the lowest and the groups without liner the highest microleakage (p= 0. 001). Significant difference was observed in microleakage mean rank of enamel and dentin margins (p= 0. 048). <b>Rebonding</b> with resin did not improve the seal (p&gt; 0. 05). Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, total etch adhesive system had significant effect on microleakage of Class V amalgam restorations especially in cervical margin. <b>Rebonding</b> did not show a significant effect on microleakage...|$|R
