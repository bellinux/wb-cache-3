25|$|He also {{insisted on}} always {{wearing the same}} {{battered}} old flowerpot sunhat during his time out in the field, a constant companion from his debut in 1981 to his last game in 2004. Russell lined up the ball with the specially cut back rim, but it ended up rather worn out. Only his wife Aileen was allowed to repair it, while Russell carried an emergency <b>repair</b> <b>kit</b> of cotton thread and rubber. Its state of age and hence apparent disrepair caused more than one argument with the authorities. Russell refused to wear the official coloured one-day sunhat in South Africa, with a compromise only reached when Russell agreed to wear his old flowerpot hat inside the new sun hat. On a second occasion in the West Indies, he agreed to wash it, and placed it to dry in an oven. Forgotten and resultantly overbaked, the hat caught fire, and was only just rescued from total incineration – the top collapsed like puff pastry on removal. The fire damage could still {{be seen on the}} hat years later.|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, the GT is the {{equivalent}} of the Japanese G model but with only an all black interior trim and standard radio head unit, whereas the top-of-the-range GTS model is {{the equivalent}} of the Japanese GT Limited except for an all black leather/Alcantara and red-stitch interior trim only and touchscreen multimedia head unit. Upon Australian launch in June 2012, all models for Australia featured a full-size spare wheel, the GTS lacked a rear spoiler, and a limited slip differential or [...] LSD was standard on all models except automatic GT's. The full-size spare wheel was phased out after the first shipments to Australia, replaced with a <b>repair</b> <b>kit.</b> This model also benefitted from a remapping of its Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to address initial reports of rough idling and stalling. The range of models and main options had the following retail prices: GT manual GT automatic GTS manual GTS automatic metallic paint [...] for all models; [...] "Aero pack" [...] bodykit [...] for GTS only.|$|E

6000|$|A {{month or}} so later--I went again, or {{it may have been}} that my car took the road of her own volition. She over-ran the fruitless Downs, {{threaded}} every turn of the maze of lanes below the hills, drew through the high- walled woods, impenetrable in their full leaf, came out at the cross roads where the butler had left me, and a little further on developed an internal trouble which forced me to turn her in on a grass way-waste that cut into a summer-silent hazel wood. So far as I could make sure by the sun and a six-inch Ordnance map, this should be the road flank of that wood which I had first explored from the heights above. I made a mighty serious business of my repairs and a glittering shop of my <b>repair</b> <b>kit,</b> spanners, pump, and the like, which I spread out orderly upon a rug. It was a trap to catch all childhood, for on such a day, I argued, the children would not be far off. When I paused in my work I listened, but the wood was so full of the noises of summer (though the birds had mated) that I could not at first distinguish these from the tread of small cautious feet stealing across the dead leaves. I rang my bell in an alluring manner, but the feet fled, and I repented, for to a child a sudden noise is very real terror. I must have been at work half an hour when I heard in the wood the voice of the blind woman crying: [...] "Children, oh children, where are you?" [...] and the stillness made slow to close on the perfection of that cry. She came towards me, half feeling her way between the tree boles, and though a child it seemed clung to her skirt, it swerved into the leafage like a rabbit as she drew nearer.|$|E

50|$|Over much use, {{the steel}} primary {{throttle}} shaft {{will tend to}} wear the aluminum casting material in the throttle body.

40|$|This PhD by {{practice}} {{explores the}} possibilities of visible repair using a design-led methodology that aims to bring a new consciousness {{to the relationship between}} consumers and products, as part of an approach to 'circular' product design. Through a series of workshops in which participants repaired broken products, Do-Fix <b>repair</b> <b>kits</b> were developed and trialled; these kits combine new technologies such as 3 D printing with traditional repair methods such as kintsugi, darning and patching, focused on making repairs both visible and engaging to carry out. Current economic systems depend on large quantities of resource and energy use that cannot be sustained with the planet’s finite resources. Producing long-lasting, purposeful and ‘circular’ products is essential in order to decrease the rate of consumption and its negative environmental impacts. Repair is an effective strategy for extending product lifespan and closing the material loops. However, increasing the product’s lifespan is also dependent upon the attitudes and behaviour of users. Therefore, the aim of this research is to explore the role of repair in user-product engagement and create a product or service that encourages people to repair products more for the purpose of awakening human sensitivity to environmental and societal problems. Conventional repair methods, such as kintsugi (a Japanese repair method using gold), darning and patching are combined with new technologies and materials, including 3 D printing, with the help of ‘research through design’ methods. All the repair techniques were tested in workshops with users. The results were fed back into the research, which was then used to develop Do-Fix <b>repair</b> <b>kits,</b> providing users with the opportunity to give a second life to an object. Here the aim is not to disguise the damage, but to make something artful out of it. The Do-Fix <b>repair</b> <b>kits</b> include four different kits, namely (1) the kintsugi kit, (2) 3 D-printed patches, (3) plaster patches for mending textiles, and (4) textile patches for fixing shoes and bags. The value of this research for design practice is in its exploration of potential methods and materials of product repair by providing concrete examples, as well as the creation of the Do-Fix <b>repair</b> <b>kits.</b> For academics and researchers its value lies in reframing the position of repair in the circular economy and developing design considerations related to product repair...|$|R
