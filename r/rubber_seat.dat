25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seat</b> cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim rings, rear seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the Futuramic 98. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for {{the first time}}.|$|E
2500|$|For 1954, the Jet {{received}} minor trim updates to its two- and four-door sedans. A new luxury model, the Jet-Liner {{was added}} making the Jet a three series model line. The Jet-Liner came with chrome trim around {{the windows and}} body side, gravel shields, as well as upgraded color-keyed vinyl interiors featuring foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seat</b> cushions.|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, Oldsmobiles were {{redesigned}} {{across the}} line, with a three body style 98 series at the top. Convertibles were dubbed Starfires, after the previous year's Starfire dream car. A slightly higher horsepower [...] Rocket V8 was {{shared with the}} Super 88 series. Standard 98 equipment included bumper guards, rubber simulated carpets front and rear, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, aluminum door sill plates, turn signals, chrome rocker panel moldings, deck lid ornament, foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seat</b> cushions, padded dash, parking brake light, courtesy light package, stainless steel wheel discs, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring.

50|$|Of {{the trio}} of well-respected faucet {{manufacturers}} in North American plumbing circles, Moen and American Standard use cartridges (Moen's being O-ring based, American Standard's being ceramic), while Delta uses easily replaced <b>rubber</b> <b>seats</b> facing the cartridge(s). Each design has its advantages: Moen cartridges tend to be easiest to find, American Standard cartridges have nearly infinite lifespan in sediment-free municipal water, and Delta's <b>rubber</b> <b>seats</b> tend to be most forgiving of sediment in well water.|$|R
50|$|As delivered, R17s {{came with}} low-running lights and very {{comfortable}} foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seats.</b> In 1957, sealed beam headlights {{were added to}} the cars. Additionally, vandalism and wear & tear contributed to rapid and frequent damage to the original seats, leading the Transit Authority to replace the seats with hard fiberglass benches similar in feel to the ones in use on New York City subway trains today.|$|R
2500|$|The largest 1962 Oldsmobiles {{were again}} the 98s. Five body styles were offered {{including}} three 4-doors plus {{an open and}} a closed 2-door. The Holiday Coupe was renamed the Holiday Sport Coupe, and the Sport Sedan was renamed the Holiday Sport Sedan, so once again, at least temporarily, all hardtops were called Holidays. [...] Ninety-Eights were well appointed with standard equipment including padded dash, guard beam frame, live rubber body cushions, coil springs, foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seats,</b> two-speed windshield wipers, parking brake lights, courtesy lamp package, special moldings, Roto Hydramatic, power brakes, power steering, power windows and power seat. Interiors were leather, vinyl or cloth. Standard tire size was 8.50 x 14inches.|$|R
2500|$|In 1952 the 98 {{remained}} {{as the top}} of the line Oldsmobile. The series shared the higher output 160 HP Rocket V8 with the Super 88s. Standard equipment on the three body styles included bumper guards, gray rubber floor mats front and rear, electric clock, dual horns, aluminum door sill plates, chrome gravel guards, foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seat</b> cushions, turn signals, carpeting front and rear, stainless steel wheel trim rings, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. Upholstery selection was broadcloth or six colors of leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] For the first time power steering was an option. Another new option was the Autronic Eye, an automatic headlight dimmer, which in its initial year was shared only with Cadillac.|$|E
2500|$|The 98 {{topped the}} Oldsmobile line again for 1951 with Three body styles available. The 4-door sedan and {{convertible}} came only with Deluxe equipment, while the Holiday hardtop was available with either Deluxe or Standard trim. The 98 standard equipment included bumper guards, cigarette lighter, dome light, rubber floor mats, stainless steel moldings, lined trunk, illuminated ashtray, foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seat</b> cushions and extra chrome moldings. Deluxe equipment was special rear door ornament, rear center armrests, Deluxe electric clock, Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring and special chrome trim. Upholstery choices were nylon cord, nylon cloth and leather. The pillared Club coupe {{was no longer}} offered. With the only choice in a closed 2-door 98 now being the hardtop, Holiday sales nearly doubled to 17,929 units.|$|E
2500|$|Again in 1956 {{the top of}} {{the line}} Oldsmobile 98 series had an {{exclusive}} [...] wheelbase, [...] longer than the 88. Power came from the 240 horsepower Rocket V8 shared with the Super 88. Standard equipment included armrests, bumper guards, lined trunk, rotary door latches, dual horns, cigarette lighter, turn signals, rubber floor mats, aluminum door sill plates, sun visors, front and rear carpeting, foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seat</b> cushions, courtesy lights, front fender medallions, deck lid '98' script, back-up light moldings, electric clock, Jetaway Hydramatic Drive, padded dash, power steering, windshield washers and Deluxe steering wheel. Upholstery choices were pattern cloth and leather in a variety of colors and combinations. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] made by either U.S. Royal, Goodrich, or Firestone. The parking brake was now a foot pedal.|$|E

2500|$|In 1955 the Oldsmobile 98 again had {{a longer}} {{wheelbase}} than the 88. Standard equipment included turn signals, bumper guards, stainless steel molfings, dual horns, cigarette lighter, {{front and rear}} floor mats, inside rearview mirror, foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seat</b> cushions, stainless steel rocker panel moldings, front seatback robe cord, spun glass hood insulation, rear window ventiplanes, electric clock, stainless steel wheel discs, custom cushion lounge seats front and rear, hand brake light, courtesy light package, padded dash, Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring, and windshield washer.

Standard tire size was [...] by [...] The optional air conditioning unit {{was moved to the}} engine bay instead of the trunk. The turning diameter was 43ft. The Hydramatic automatic transmission gear selector had an S on it, which was used for better performance climbing hills. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday sedan, in the 98 series. The 4-door Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, along with the 4-door 88 Holiday and the 4-door Buick Century Riviera and 4-door Special Riviera, were the first 4-door hardtops ever produced. Perhaps because of the popularity of the new 4-door hardtop body style total 98 sales set a new record of 118,626.|$|E
2500|$|The 1950 Oldsmobile 98 {{repeated}} its 1948 precedent of previewing some of next years styling cues for the 88. The 98 was restyled {{after only}} two years. It {{was the first}} totally slab sided Oldsmobile and the first sedan with wraparound rear windows. A 4-door 98 fastback appeared for one year only in 1950 and was called the Town Sedan, selling only 1,778 units. Standard equipment included bumper guards, dual horns, parking lamps, dome light, rubber floor mats, aluminum sill plates, foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seat</b> cushions, chrome interior trim, lined luggage compartment and counterbalanced trunk lid. Deluxe 98 equipment included rear seat armrest, Deluxe electric clock, Deluxe steering wheel and horn button, special door trim and stainless steel wheel trim rings. Upholstery choices spanned nylon fabric, striped broadcloth or leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] In 1950, Oldsmobile stopped naming the 98 series and so from then through 1996, {{with the exception of}} 1957 when it was called the Starfire 98, and in 1961 when it was called the Classic 98, it was simply known as the Oldsmobile 98. Sales of the 98 Holiday nearly tripled to 8263, approaching the 11,989 sold of the Club coupe. Given the rapidly growing popularity of the 2-door Holiday hardtop, 1950 was the last year for the pillared Club coupe. Total sales set yet another record of 106,220.|$|E

5000|$|The Western Pacific's Zephyrette {{consisted}} of a Budd RDC that was powered by twin inline six General Motors diesel engines, which each produced , and equipped with Allison torque converters. This setup allowed each RDC to cruise at 70 mph in direct drive and 55 mph in torque conversion mode during operation. The foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seats</b> in the RDCs were rated as [...] "comfortable" [...] at speeds up to 83 mph {{and the application of}} disc brakes allowed fully loaded cars to stop from a speed of 85 mph in 2,330 ft. In 6,000 mi of testing and evaluation, the Western Pacific determined that its RDCs averaged 2.8 mpg, which at contemporary diesel prices yielded fuel costs of barely over 3 cents per mile; this compared favorably to the performance of steam locomotives on similar routes, which accrued costs of approximately 22 cents per mile.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} years saw the radiator grille painted black (rather than grey). In 1976, the 101L replaced the De Luxe model, featuring new bumpers with <b>rubber</b> trim, flat-folding <b>seat</b> backs, chrome-trimmed radiator grille, reverse light, electric windshield-washer pump, coolant-temperature gauge, cigarette lighter and servo brakes.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1949 by Dr. Lino Pasquali, {{the company}} began {{production}} of two-wheel tractors, and in the late 1950s ergonomic improvements such as <b>rubber</b> tires, <b>seat,</b> and steering handles were added. In the late 1960s a line of articulated four-wheel tractors was added. In 1999, the BCS group purchased the Pasquali brand. Pasquali machines work all over the world, {{with a wide range}} of motor mowers, two-wheel tractors, and specialized tractors with power up to 100 hp. Headquarters and factories are located at Abbiategrasso.|$|R

Other supplementary buildings are: meeting room, office space, cafeteria, fitness center, computers room, audio-visual room, and library.|$|R
50|$|Hudson {{automobiles}} {{were more}} fully equipped than competitive makes, and all Hudson models received door arm rests, twin air-horns, ashtrays, windshield wipers, stop lights, locking glove box, sealed beam headlights, and deep pile carpeting. Commodore and Commodore Customs added foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seat</b> cushions (Hudson {{was the first}} automaker to introduce foam seat cushions), door-step courtesy lights, rear arm rest (sedans) and gold etched lettering on the dash board panel.|$|E
50|$|The D3 Major {{represented}} {{the first step}} in development of the Bantam, although the D1 would be produced for many years to come. First produced in late (most likely October was the first released) 1953 with a 150cc engine, the D3 continued in production until 1957. A modern-style foam-filled pillion seat was fitted as standard, an economy and comfort breakthrough that had become popular as an option on the D1. It replaced the original standard fitting of a parcel carrier behind an individual sprung <b>rubber</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 66 and 68 were {{renamed the}} Dynamic 66 and 68 in 1948. The Dynamic 60 series were the {{smallest}} Oldsmobiles available and offered the greatest variety or body styles. Either 6-cylinder or 8-cylinder engines were available and were designated 66 or 68. Standard 60 Series equipment included: dual horns, dual sun visors and a cigarette lighter. The Deluxe equipment package added foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seat</b> cushions, Deluxe steering wheel, Deluxe instrument cluster, clock and chrome wheel trim rings. Standard tires were 6.00 x 16 inches. Upholstery was Bedford cord or broadcloth.|$|E
50|$|The R46s were {{constructed}} with sheet <b>rubber</b> floors, plastic <b>seats,</b> fluorescent lighting, spaces for ceiling advertisements {{and the use}} of air springs instead of heavy metal springs. The change in springs reduced noisy and bumpy rides. The cars weren't equipped with straphangers like previous models. Instead, horizontal bars that passengers could hold on to were installed. The cars were built with air-conditioning.|$|R
50|$|The {{atmosphere}} within waveguide assemblies {{is often}} pressurized, either {{to prevent the}} ingress of moisture, or to raise the breakdown voltage in the guide and hence increase the power that it can carry. Pressurization requires that all joints in the waveguide be airtight. This is usually achieved {{by means of a}} <b>rubber</b> O-ring <b>seated</b> in a groove in the face of at least one of flanges forming each join. Gasket, gasket/cover or pressurizable flanges (such as that on the right of figure 2), are identifiable by the single circular groove which accommodates the O-ring. It is only necessary for one of the flanges in each pressurizable connection to be of this type; the other may have a plain flat face (like that in figure 1). This ungrooved type is known as a cover, plain or unpressurizable flange.|$|R
2500|$|A major styling {{change was}} seen in 1958. The 98 series again had its own {{exclusive}} wheelbase of 126.5inches while sharing the more powerful Rocket V8 with the Super 88. Four body styles were available. Standard series equipment included four headlights, oil filter, turn signals, printed circuit instrument cluster, aluminum anodized grille, padded dash, foam <b>rubber</b> padded <b>seat</b> cushions, courtesy lights, parking brake light, special side moldings, chrome rocker panel moldings, Jetaway Hydramatic transmission, power steering and brakes, dual exhaust, electric clock, color accented wheel discs, and chrome wheel frames. Interiors could be ordered {{in a variety of}} colored leathers, cloth, and Morocceen. Standard tires were [...] by [...] Air suspension was added as an option. Also new was a speed warning device, which could be set towards a certain speed and when the limit was reached, a buzzer would sound, alerting the driver of the vehicle to slow down.|$|R
50|$|In 1952 the 98 {{remained}} {{as the top}} of the line Oldsmobile. The series shared the higher output 160 HP Rocket V8 with the Super 88s.

Upholstery selection was broadcloth or six colors of leather. Standard tire size was 8.00 in by 15 in. For the first time power steering was an option. Another new option was the Autronic Eye, an automatic headlight dimmer, which in its initial year was shared only with Cadillac.|$|E
50|$|Sleek {{fastback}} styling {{characterized the}} B-bodied Streamliner Torpedo. The roofline swept from the windshield {{to the rear}} bumper in one smooth curve. The front end sheet metal {{was the same as}} on the Deluxe Torpedo and trim difference between sixes and eights were also the same. Streamliner Sixes were in Series 26. Streamliner Eights were in Series 28. Beige corded wool cloth upholstery. There was also a Super Streamliner Torpedo subseries. Supers had the same body styling and trim but featured two-tone worsted wool cloth upholstery with pin stripes. They also added sponge <b>rubber</b> <b>seat</b> cushions, electric clocks, deluxe flexible steering wheels and divan type seats with folding center armrests. Two bodystyles were available: a 5-passenger 2-door Sedan Coupe and a 5-passenger 4-door Sedan.|$|E
5000|$|In 1954, Oldsmobiles were {{redesigned}} {{across the}} line, with a three body style 98 series at the top. Convertibles were dubbed Starfires, after the previous year's Starfire dream car. A slightly higher horsepower 324 cuin L Rocket V8 was {{shared with the}} Super 88 series. Standard 98 equipment included bumper guards, rubber simulated carpets front and rear, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, aluminum door sill plates, turn signals, chrome rocker panel moldings, deck lid ornament, foam <b>rubber</b> <b>seat</b> cushions, padded dash, parking brake light, courtesy light package, stainless steel wheel discs, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. Upholstery choices were nylon and leather, {{in a variety of}} colors. Standard tire size was 8.00 in by 15 in.|$|E
50|$|The {{tire bead}} {{is the part}} of the tire that {{contacts}} the rim on the wheel. The bead is typically reinforced with steel wire and compounded of high strength, low flexibility <b>rubber.</b> The bead <b>seats</b> tightly against the two rims on the wheel to ensure that a tubeless tire holds air without leakage. The bead fit is tight to ensure the tire does not shift circumferentially as the wheel rotates. The width of the rim in relationship to the tire is a factor in the handling characteristics of an automobile, because the rim supports the tire's profile.|$|R
5000|$|The 1939 models joined other American {{cars in the}} use of a column-mounted {{gearshift}} lever. This freed front-seat {{passenger space}} and remained the industry standard through the 1960s, when [...] "bucket seats" [...] came into vogue. Hudson became the first car manufacturer to use foam <b>rubber</b> in its <b>seats.</b> The Hudson Terraplane was dropped. For 1940 Hudson introduced coil spring independent front suspension, aircraft style shock absorbers mounted within the front springs and true center-point steering on all its models, a major advance in performance among cars in this price range. Despite all these changes, Hudson sales for 1940 were lower than 1939 and the company lost money again. The advent of military contracts the following year brought relief.|$|R
