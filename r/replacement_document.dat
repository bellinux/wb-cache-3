In such patients, lactose intolerance is characterized by abdominal symptoms (e. g. nausea, bloating, and pain) after ingestion of dairy products. The genetic basis of lactose malabsorption is established and several tests for this condition are available, including genetic, endoscopic, and H 2 -breath tests. In contrast, lactose intolerance is less well understood. Recent {{studies show that the}} risk of symptoms after lactose ingestion depends on the dose of lactose, lactase expression, intestinal flora, and sensitivity of the gastrointestinal tract. Lactose intolerance has recently been defined as symptoms developing after ingestion of lactose which do not develop after placebo challenge in a person with lactose maldigestion. Such blinded testing might be especially important in those with functional gastrointestinal diseases in whom self-reported lactose intolerance is common. However, placebo-controlled testing is not part of current clinical practice. Updated protocols and high-quality outcome studies are needed.

However, in order to implement these novel schemes, one needs to maintain complicated data structures. We propose randomized algorithms for approximating any existing web-cache replacement scheme and thereby avoid the need for any data structures. At document-replacement times, the randomized algorithm samples N documents from the cache and replaces the least useful document from the sample, where usefulness is determined according to the criteria mentioned above. The next M < N least useful documents are retained for the succeeding iteration. When the next replacement is to be performed, the algorithm obtains N M new samples from the cache, and replaces the least useful document from the N M new samples and the M previously retained.

Also that year, a pact between the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), who had won the elections, and the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), who came in second, resulted in additional changes. The President was to be elected by the Parliament rather than directly; the constructive vote of no confidence was introduced; and areas in which a two-thirds majority was required to adopt a law were reduced, making governing easier. In exchange for agreeing to this set of MDF proposals, Árpád Göncz of the SZDSZ was elected President.

This enhanced supermajority provision was meant to ensure that the replacement constitution would enjoy broad acceptance.

We characterize the popularity pmf of the stream of misses from the cache, the so-called output of the cache, for a large class of cache replacement policies, including standard on-demand replacement algorithms such as the policy A_ 0 and the random policy, {{as well as the}} LRU and CLIMB policies. We measure strength of locality of reference in a stream of requests through the skewness of its popularity distribution. Using the notion of majorization to capture the degree of skewness, we show that for the policy A_ 0 and the random policy, the output always has less locality of reference than the input. However, we show by counterexamples that this is not always the case under the LRU and CLIMB policies when the input is selected according to a Zipf-like pmf. In that case, conjectures are offered (and supported by simulations) as to when LRU or CLIMB caching indeed reduces locality of reference. <p...|$|R
