25|$|In 1940, the Gladding, McBean & Co. {{introduced}} {{their first}} hand-painted embossed earthenware dinnerware line Franciscan Apple, and shortly thereafter in 1941, Desert <b>Rose.</b> <b>Apple</b> {{was adapted from}} the embossed pattern Zona, produced by the Weller Pottery Company of Ohio. Desert Rose {{was based on a}} pattern design by contract designer Annette Honeywell. Desert Rose would become one of Gladding, McBean & Co.’s bestselling dinnerware lines.|$|E

All other dinnerware and tile lines were discontinued. [...] Archival examples of the Franciscan ware were packed up and given to the Wedgwood Museum.|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} later I {{obtained}} an exceedingly beautiful new butterfly, allied to the fine blue Papilio Ulysses, but differing from it in the colour being of a more intense tint, and in having a row of blue stripes around {{the margin of the}} lower wings. This good beginning was, however, rather deceptive, and I soon found that insects, and especially butterflies, were somewhat scarce, and birds in tar less variety than I had anticipated. Several of the fine Moluccan species were however obtained. The handsome red lory with green wings and a yellow spot in the back (Lorius garrulus), was not uncommon. When the Jambu, or <b>rose</b> <b>apple</b> (Eugenic sp.), was in flower in the village, flocks of the little lorikeet (Charmosyna placentis), already met with in Gilolo, came to feed upon the nectar, and I obtained as many specimens as I desired. Another beautiful bird of the parrot tribe was the Geoffroyus cyanicollis, a green parrot with a red bill and head, which colour shaded on the crown into azure blue, and thence into verditer blue and the green of the back. Two large and handsome fruit pigeons, with metallic green, ashy, and rufous plumage, were not uncommon; and I was rewarded by finding a splendid deep blue roller (Eurystomus azureus); a lovely golden-capped sunbird (Nectarinea auriceps), and a fine racquet-tailed kingfisher (Tanysiptera isis), all of which were entirely new to ornithologists. Of insects I obtained a considerable number of interesting beetles, including many fine longicorns, among which was the largest and handsomest species of the genus Glenea yet discovered. Among butterflies the beautiful little Danis sebae was abundant, making the forests gay with its delicate wings of white and the richest metallic blue; while showy Papilios, and pretty Pieridae, and dark, rich Euphaeas, many of them new, furnished a constant source of interest and pleasing occupation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine post-harvest damage to <b>rose</b> <b>apples</b> due to transportation hazards and to comparatively evaluate the performance of the current and proposed wholesale packaging for the fruit. The methodology comprised of sampling and conducting damage analysis of <b>rose</b> <b>apples</b> of two varieties (Thongsamsri and Toonklao) distributed using commercial packaging to various retailers and wholesalers selected at random around the Bangkok metropolitan areas. Three kinds of current wholesale packaging were packed with newly harvested, damage-free, and uniform sized Thongsamsri <b>rose</b> <b>apples</b> and tested using a vibration simulator. The same testing was performed for the two types of proposed wholesale packaging. Performance of both types of packaging was evaluated in terms of damage parameters. Results showed that the post-harvest damage was mainly in the form of bruising and abrasion. The average fruit damage and the average damage percentage of abrasion were higher than that of bruising at both the wholesaler and retailer levels. The average fruit damage and the average damage percentages at the retailer were greater than that at the wholesaler for both varieties. Majority of the damage seen in the current packaging was a combination of bruising and abrasion. The proposed packaging uses diagonally horizontal fruit orientation which imparts a minimum bruising with negligible abrasion...|$|R

50|$|Phetchaburi {{is known}} for a vast variety of sweets. The {{reputation}} of these sweets stems {{from the use of}} Tanot (palm) sugar as an ingredient. Examples are Mo-kaeng, a sweet made from flour, sugar and eggs; A-lua and Sampanni, a sweet made from flour and sugar; Thong Yip, Thong Yot and Foi Thong, sweets made from baked egg-yolk; and Chao Tan Chueam (palm seed in thick syrup). Khao chae (rice served with ice and sweetened meat) is a renowned local dish and is popular during the summer season. Khanomchin Thotman (rice noodles with fishcakes) is also a popular dish.
