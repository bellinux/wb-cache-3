25|$|Sneevliet, as a {{committed}} socialist and militant trade unionist, was strongly supportive {{of an international}} seamen's strike which was called in 1911 and was disgruntled {{by the failure of}} his union and political party to support the campaign. As a result, he resigned from both organizations, joining instead the more radical Social Democratic Party of the Netherlands (forerunner of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party)</b> and writing for the Marxist magazine De Nieuwe Tijd (The New Time). Sneevliet's alienation strengthened him in his decision to leave the Netherlands for the Dutch East Indies.|$|R

The <b>Dutch</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (CPN) reestablished the Friendship Society as late as March 1947, {{at a time when the}} sympathy of the general public towards the USSR had faded away. It treated its own suborganisation with scepticism and mistrust. Twice, in 1956 and in 1963, party leader De Groot tried to liquidate the society altogether, but his attempts were in vain.

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} war, the {{communist}} movement enjoyed popularity, {{partly because of}} the effort of the USSR in defeating the Nazis. However, with that country's increasing influence in Eastern Europe, the popularity decreased. Because the <b>Dutch</b> <b>communist</b> <b>party</b> celebrated her as an icon, her popularity decreased too, {{to the point that the}} commemoration at Hannie's grave was forbidden in 1951. The commemorators (who were estimated to number over 10,000) were stopped by several hundred police and military with the aid of four tanks. A group of seven managed to circumvent the blockade and reached the burial ground, but were arrested when they tolled the bell. From the next year on, the communists decided to prevent another such scene by holding their commemoration in Haarlem instead.|$|R

50|$|When the old Felix Meritis {{society was}} {{dissolved}} in 1888, the printing company Holdert & Co., which {{became one of}} Amsterdams largest printing companies, moved into the building. In 1932 {{part of the building}} was destroyed in a fire. After the Second World War the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of the Netherlands set up its headquarters in the building. From 1947 until 1981 its newspaper De Waarheid (The Truth) rolled from the presses. In the 50s, Felix Meritis became the symbol of communism in the Netherlands. This image became especially embedded in the collective memory when the building was stormed on 4 November 1956, in response to the Soviet invasion of Hungary and its endorsement by the <b>Dutch</b> <b>communist</b> <b>party.</b> However, in the late sixties, Felix Meritis became a cradle of evenings for alternative youth, which were named Provadya. In 1969 the Shaffy Theater opened, which gained a reputation as a stopping place for the Dutch avant-garde, including Ramses Shaffy, Baal, Neerlands Hoop, Independent Theater and Hauser Orkater.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} morning of 22 June 1941, Adolf Hitler broke the pact by {{implementing}} Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union that began the war on the Eastern Front. Already in autumn 1940 Stalin received a warning from the <b>Dutch</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> via the network of the Red Orchestra, that Hitler was preparing for a winter war by allowing the construction of thousands of snow landing gears for the Junkers Ju 52 transport planes. Although Stalin had received warnings from spies like Richard Sorge, Stalin's top spy in Imperial Japan, and his own Red Army generals, he felt that Germany would not attack the Soviet Union until Germany had defeated Britain. In the initial hours after the German attack commenced, Stalin hesitated, wanting {{to ensure that the}} German attack was sanctioned by Hitler, rather than the unauthorized action of a rogue general.|$|R
25|$|Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Netherlands on 10 May 1940 and {{took control of}} the country. Some Amsterdam {{citizens}} sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to a high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. More than 100,000 Dutch Jews were deported to Nazi concentration camps, of whom some 60,000 lived in Amsterdam. In response, the <b>Dutch</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> organised the February strike attended by 300,000 people to protest against the raids. Perhaps the most famous deportee was the young Jewish girl Anne Frank, who died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. At the end of the Second World War, communication {{with the rest of the}} country broke down, and food and fuel became scarce. Many citizens travelled to the countryside to forage. Dogs, cats, raw sugar beets, and Tulip bulbs—cooked to a pulp—were consumed to stay alive. Most of the trees in Amsterdam were cut down for fuel, and all the wood was taken from the apartments of deported Jews.|$|R
2500|$|De Kadt's early {{political}} career was shaped, in part, by {{the influence of}} Rosa Luxemburg. He [...] joined the <b>Dutch</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> soon only to become disenchanted with it and, especially, with the political developments in the Soviet Union. In consequence, he left the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Holland in 1924. He subsequently chronicled his embrace of, and break with, Communism in {{the first volume of}} his autobiography, Uit mijn communistentijd, published in Amsterdam in 1965 by his loyal publisher, G.A. van Oorschot. De Kadt developed into a trenchant and increasingly uncompromising critic of Stalinism, and articulated an independent line of socialist thought and political practice. This was expressed both in the content of his first major book, From Tsarism to Stalinism published in 1935 in Antwerp,and in his pivotal role {{in the formation of the}} Independent Socialist Party (Netherlands) (OSP). The book, which identified a continuity between the character of the Tsarist state and the Soviet political system under Stalin, contained an intimation of De Kadt's broader critique of twentieth century totalitarianism – a critique which was to define the nature of his subsequent {{political career}}.|$|R
5000|$|The {{trial began}} at 8:45 {{on the morning}} of 21 September, with Van der Lubbe testifying. Van der Lubbe's {{testimony}} was very hard to follow as he spoke of losing his sight in one eye and wandering around Europe as a drifter and that he {{had been a member of}} the <b>Dutch</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> which he quit in 1931, but still considered himself a communist. Georgi Dimitrov began his testimony on the third day of the trial. He gave up his right to a court-appointed lawyer and defended himself successfully. When warned by Judge Bürger to behave himself in court, Dimitrov stated: [...] "Herr President, if you were a man as innocent as myself and you had passed seven months in prison, five of them in chains night and day, you would understand it if one perhaps becomes a little strained." [...] During the course of his defence, Dimitrov claimed that the organizers of the fire were senior members of the Nazi Party and frequently verbally clashed with Göring at the trial. The highpoint of the trial occurred on 4 November 1933, when Göring took the stand and was cross-examined by Dimitrov. The following exchange took place: ...|$|R

Platje, member of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>communist</b> <b>party,</b> about rights and obligations under the labour law. The unions got involved and strikes were initiated. The dispute {{ended up in the}} longest strike in the electrotechnical industry in the Netherlands, which lastet for almost half a year and several court cases were held. The Dutch Union NVV (Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen) with chairman Arie Groenevelt [...] (quote: we will strike until the company ceases) [...] was not willing to amend their demands and as a result the company went into receivership. This made an ending to the Pelger era and 102 Fte's lost their jobs. The company received national notority, due to all the publicity. To continue the employment of the workers a foundation was raised, named Stichting voor behoud van Werkgelegenheid: Combinatie Machines Apparaten en Constructies, or in short COMBIMAC. In the committee of the foundation the following people were appointed: Mr. P.J.S. de Jong, former Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Minister of Defense. Mr. A. Jellesma, director of company W. Hubert & Co. in Sneek and Mr. W. de Vries director of company Hydro-Holland in Meppel. The company continued with 35 Fte's. In 1976 Mr. P.W. Glasmacher, working as a vice director at that time in the company, takes over the foundation and transfers it back into a company: Machine- en Apparatenfabriek Combimac B.V. In 1993 Mr. H.J.

It was the first resistance organisation in the country. As a result, some 2,000 communists were to lose their lives in torture rooms, concentration camps or by firing squad. On the same day Bernardus IJzerdraat distributed leaflets protesting against the German occupation and called on the public to resist the Germans. This was the first public act of resistance. IJzerdraat started to build an illegal resistance organisation called De Geuzen, named after a group who rebelled against Spanish occupation in the 16th century.|$|R
