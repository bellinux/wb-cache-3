25|$|Contributing {{factors include}} the following: first, the first officer's {{predisposition}} to overreact to wake turbulence; second, the training provided by American Airlines {{that could have}} encouraged pilots to make large flight control inputs; third, the first officer likely not understanding an airplane's response to large rudder inputs at high airspeeds or the mechanism by which the rudder rolls a transport-category airplane; finally, light <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> forces and small pedal displacement of the A300-600 <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> system increased the airplane's susceptibility to a rudder misuse.|$|E
25|$|The {{landing gear}} is of a {{tricycle}} configuration {{with all three}} wheels mounted on steel sprung gear legs. The nosewheel is free castering and the aircraft is steered with differential braking. The brakes are mounted conventionally on the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> toes.|$|E
25|$|NTSB investigators' post-accident {{investigation}} {{showed that}} because of the positioning of the fuel selector valves, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to yaw (Nose right) and pitch up.|$|E
50|$|Primary {{flight control}} is {{achieved}} by use of dual control wheels and <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals.</b> The control wheels operate the elevator and ailerons mechanically through a system of cables, pulleys, push-pull tubes and bell cranks.

The <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> mechanically operate the rudder for directional yaw control. Nose wheel steering is electrically controlled via the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals.</b>|$|R

25|$|According to the {{official}} accident report, after the first officer made his initial <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> input, he {{made a series of}} alternating full rudder inputs. This led to increasing sideslip angles. The resulting hazardous sideslip angle led to extremely high aerodynamic loads that resulted in separation of the vertical stabilizer. If the first officer had stopped making these inputs at any time before the vertical stabilizer separation, the natural stability of the airplane would have returned the sideslip angle to near 0°, and the accident would have been avoided. The airplane performance study indicated that when the vertical stabilizer separation began, the aerodynamic loads were about two times the loads defined by the design envelope. It can be determined that the vertical stabilizer's structural performance was consistent with design specifications and exceeded certification requirements.|$|E

2500|$|Both the CVR and FDR were {{recovered}} {{and used for}} the investigation. Due to the limited parameters recorded by the FDR, investigators did {{not have access to}} the position of the flight-control surfaces (rudder, ailerons, elevator, etc.) for the accident. However, two parameters recorded by the FDR were crucial, one being the aircraft's heading, the other being the pitch control yoke position. During the approach, Flight 427 encountered wake turbulence from Delta 1083; the FAA, however, determined [...] "the wake vortex encounter alone would not have caused the continued heading change that occurred after 1903:00." [...] The abrupt heading change shortly before the dive pointed investigators immediately to the rudder. Due to the absence of <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> positions from the data, investigators had to determine whether the rudder moved hard-over by a malfunction or by pilot command. This in turn led to the CVR being more heavily scrutinized than most other recordings as statements and breathing from the pilots could potentially tell investigators if they were fighting for control over a rudder malfunction or inadvertently stomped on the wrong <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> in excitement from the wake-turbulence. Boeing felt the latter more likely, while USAir and the Pilot's Union felt the former was more likely.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{aircraft}} {{commonly used}} tailwheels, many aircraft (like {{a number of}} First World War Sopwith aircraft, such as the Camel fighter) were equipped with steerable tailskids, which operate similar to a tailwheel. When the pilot pressed the right <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> — or the right footrest of a [...] "rudder bar" [...] in World War I — the skid pivoted to the right, creating more drag {{on that side of}} the plane and causing it to turn to the right. While less effective than a steerable wheel, it gave the pilot some control of the direction the craft was moving while taxiing or beginning the takeoff run, before there was enough airflow over the rudder for it to become effective.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{aircraft}} require {{increased pressure}} on the rudder pedals {{to achieve the same}} amount of rudder control at a higher speed. The Airbus A300 and later Airbus A310 do not operate on a fly-by-wire flight control system, but instead use conventional mechanical flight controls. The NTSB determined that [...] "because of its high sensitivity, the A300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> inputs at higher speeds". The Allied Pilots Association, in its submission to the NTSB, argued that the unusual sensitivity of the rudder mechanism amounted to a design flaw which Airbus should have communicated to the airline. The main rationale for their position came from a 1997 report that referenced 10 incidents in which A300 tail fins had been stressed beyond their design limitation.|$|E
25|$|The cockpit was on {{the leading}} edge of the wing. Conventional stick and <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> {{controlled}} the ailerons, elevator and rudder.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> are dual control. The {{distance}} from the seat to the pedals is fixed because the seat position is not adjustable.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} primary flight controls: control stick, <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals,</b> and throttle. Typically, the control stick is termed the cyclic and tilts the rotor in the desired {{direction}} to provide {{pitch and roll}} control (some autogyros do not tilt the rotor relative to the airframe, or only do so in one dimension, and have conventional control surfaces to vary the remaining degrees of freedom). The <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> provide yaw control, and the throttle controls engine power.|$|R
2500|$|The A300-600 {{took off}} {{immediately}} after a Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400 {{on the same}} runway. It flew into the larger jet's wake, an area of turbulent air. The first officer attempted to stabilize the aircraft with alternating aggressive rudder inputs. The force of the air flowing against the moving rudder stressed the aircraft's vertical stabilizer, and eventually snapped it off entirely, causing the aircraft to lose control and crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the enormous stress on the rudder {{was due to the}} first officer's [...] "unnecessary and excessive" [...] rudder inputs, and not the wake turbulence caused by the 747. The NTSB further stated [...] "if the first officer had stopped making additional inputs, the aircraft would have stabilized". [...] Contributing to these <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> inputs were characteristics of the Airbus A300-600 sensitive rudder system design and elements of the American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Training Program (AAMP).|$|E
2500|$|The ERCO 310, which {{included}} a fully cowled engine, made its first flight in October 1937 at College Park Airport and was soon renamed the [...] "Ercoupe". The easy-to-fly design included unique design features, including a large glazed canopy for improved visibility. The prototype 310 featured an ERCO-made inverted four-cylinder engine, the ERCO I-L 116, which was quickly dropped due to its high manufacturing cost compared to the new Continental A-65 horizontal. Lacking rudder pedals, the Ercoupe was flown using only the control wheel. A two-control system linked the rudder and aileron systems, which controlled yaw and roll, with the steerable nosewheel. The control wheel controlled the pitch and the steering of the aircraft, both {{on the ground and}} in the air, simplifying control and coordinated turning and eliminating the need for rudder pedals. A completely new category of pilot's license was created by the CAA for Ercoupe pilots who had never used a <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal.</b>|$|E
2500|$|USAir {{submitted}} to the NTSB that pilots should receive training with regard to a plane's crossover speed and recovery from full rudder deflection. As a result, pilots were warned of and trained {{how to deal with}} insufficient aileron authority at an airspeed at or less than , formerly the usual approach speed for a Boeing 737. Boeing maintained that the most likely cause of the crash was that the co-pilot inadvertently deflected the rudder hard-over in the wrong direction while in a panic and for unknown reasons maintained this input until impact with the ground. According to aviation law firm Katzman, Lampert, and McClune, which represented families and victims of both US Air 427 and United 585, Boeing did not contest in open court that its 737's rudder was prone to an uncommanded rudder issue while in flight. Nonetheless, Boeing agreed to redesign the rudder control system with a redundant backup and paid for the retrofit of the entire worldwide 737 fleet. As one of the NTSB's main recommendations, airlines were required to add four additional channels of information — pilot <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> commands — into flight data recorders, to which the FAA gave airlines until August 2001 to comply. In 2016, former investigator John Cox stated that time so far has proven the NTSB correct in their findings due to the absence of a rudder reversal incident since Boeing's redesign.|$|E
