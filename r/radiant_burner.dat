40|$|Results of the Advanced Radiant Combustion System (ARCS) {{project are}} {{presented}} in this report. This work was performed by Alzeta Corporation as prime contractor under a contract to the U. S. Department of Energy Office of Industrial Technologies {{as part of a}} larger DOE program entitled Research Program for Advanced Combustion Systems. The goals of the Alzeta ARCS project were to (a) Improve the high temperature performance characteristics of porous surface ceramic fiber burners, (b) Develop an Advanced Radiant Combustion System (ARCS) that combines combustion controls with an advanced <b>radiant</b> <b>burner,</b> and (c) Demonstrate the advanced burner and controls in an industrial application. Prior to the start of this project, Alzeta had developed and commercialized a porous surface <b>radiant</b> <b>burner,</b> the Pyrocore{trademark} burner. The product had been commercially available for approximately 5 years and had achieved commercial success in a number of applications ranging from small burners for commercial cooking equipment to large burners for low temperature industrial fluid heating applications. The burner was not recommended for use in applications with process temperatures above 1000 {degrees}F, which prevented the burner from being used in intermediate to high temperature processes in the chemical and petroleum refining industries. The interest in increasing the maximum use temperature of the burner was motivated in part by a desire to expand the number of applications that could use the Pyrocore product, but also because many of the fluid sensitive heating applications of interest would benefit from the distributed flux characteristic of porous surface burners.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years gas {{combustion}} technology has undergone important innovations especially in residential heating appliances. In particular, requirements on low emissions together with load modulation has led to the use of premixed combustion technologies besides traditional diffusive flames. Constant demand for smaller overall dimensions and cost optimization has led to design combustion chambers with higher combustion intensity and this has led to premixed surface <b>burners,</b> then to <b>radiant</b> <b>burners,</b> and then to metallic mat burners in particular. With the metallic mat combustion flame front stabilizes above a metallic mat and at specific power loads is located inside. It differs from porous matrix combustion where combustion takes place inside a solid. If the initial calculations show that the convection heat exchange is not enough to establish the designed combustion intensity, the use of <b>radiant</b> <b>burners</b> becomes decisive. The radiative contribution of the mat is naturally predominant in the power range when flame develops within the mat itself. Apart from the radiative contribution, the metallic mat has others functions: it increases the operating margin with regards to flame lift-off and flashback that can happen with the variation in excess air and gas type like the light-back limit gas (as defined in EN 676). Metallic mat combustion is widely used in residential heating (at least in Europe) especially in those applica-tions where condensation is sought. It is also used in process applications like bread ovens, paint ovens and where a radiant load is required. In the following, metallic mat combustion technology will be described with special reference to metallic mat production technology and material selection. Next, testing for such technology and especially combustion testing will be presented. At the end some design issues regarding combustion chamber coupled with this tech-nology will be given...|$|R

Depending on initial conditions one of these combustion regimes is established. Dependencies of porous-shell temperature, total radiation power and radiation efficiency on the firing rate and mixture composition are obtained for {{both internal and external}} combustion regimes.

40|$|Inert porous <b>radiant</b> <b>burners</b> are {{commonly}} employed in materials processing and manufacturing (drying, cooking, etc.). In {{spite of this}} extensive use, little knowledge was available concerning the operating characteristics and flame structure of such burners until recently. The advent {{of a new generation}} of natural gas-fired burners that include an active matrix introduces further challenges and opens new areas of research. The first catalytic heaters were diffusion-type; recent attempts to improve performance suggest that higher firing rates and efficiency can be attained in a partially-premixed mode. Yet, the effects of the partially-premixed air on the catalytic combustion process have to be determined. ^ The objective of the present work is to investigate theoretically and experimentally the performance characteristics of premixed and partially-premixed inert porous burners. A one-dimensional model for solving the conservation equations inside a porous material, including the detailed chemical kinetics for methane-air mixtures, is developed by modifying an existing burner-stabilized flame computer program. The chemical reactions are modeled using the GRI-Mech 2. 11 mechanism. An energy equation for the solid matrix is introduced to the original system. The convection heat transfer between the gas and solid phases is characterized by means of a volumetric heat transfer coefficient. ^ The results of the experimental and theoretical investigation on metal-fiber porous <b>radiant</b> <b>burners</b> are presented. The experimental burner consisted of a specially-designed multi-diffuser housing capable of producing a very uniform gas flow distribution. Commercial-grade methane is used to simulate the natural gas. Radiation efficiency, gas and solid temperatures, and pollutant emissions data are obtained at atmospheric pressure for firing rates that cover the industrial operation range of interest. Fuel rich equivalence ratios naturally lead to a partially-premixed flame. It was expected that fuel lean and stoichiometric conditions would yield a conventional premixed flame structure. However, the heat transfer to the solid matrix led to some degree of partially-premixed burning for these conditions as well. ^ An extensive parametric study is carried out to investigate the effects of several parameters on a model burner performance. Emphasis is placed on thermal performance and parameters such as temperature distributions, flame location, the radiation efficiency and pollutant emissions. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The present paper compares full {{kinetics}} {{mechanisms in}} numerical modelling of porous <b>radiant</b> <b>burners</b> (PRB), with their reduced forms. The two {{most frequently used}} mechanisms of methane combustion (GRI 3. 0 and Miller) were selected and their effects were examined on temperature, species concentration, burning speed, and pollutant emission. While the findings of numerical simulation of PRB show fine concurrence between each full mechanism and its related reduced mechanism, no significant temperature differences are observed in the results of full mechanisms. However, CO concentration along burner axis shows a small difference between two full mechanisms, which is related to HCO and HO 2 concentrations. The inconsistency is more pronounced for NO concentration along porous axis, {{which is due to}} prompt NO evaluation. The present research finds deviation also between burning speeds, calculated by numerical simulation and experimental results. This difference is much more significant in rich mixtures.
