The letter [...] "D" [...] in D-brane <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> that it satisfies, the Dirichlet boundary condition.|$|E
2500|$|Impaired fasting glycaemia or {{impaired}} {{fasting glucose}} (IFG) <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> in which the fasting blood glucose or the 3-month average blood glucose (A1C) is elevated above what is considered normal levels but is not high enough to be classified as diabetes mellitus. It is considered a pre-diabetic state, associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of cardiovascular pathology, although of lesser risk than impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). IFG sometimes progresses to type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is a 50% risk over 10 years of progressing to overt diabetes.

(3 - 5) Early intervention indicates early detection, diagnosis, and rehabilitation training for children with DD.

25|$|A {{functional}} analysis {{is the most}} direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects {{on the behavior of}} interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>condition.</b> In <b>a</b> {{functional analysis}}, <b>conditions</b> are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent of responding to test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above the control condition (described below) {{it can be said that}} there is a functional relation between that condition and the behavior of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are <b>a</b> few limitations <b>to</b> this particular method. When deciding to use this method, it should be noted that there is a chance of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors.|$|R
