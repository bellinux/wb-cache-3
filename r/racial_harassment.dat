Ellis held progressive views on the subject, and Sorabji expressed high admiration for him, dedicating his Piano Concerto No. 7, Simorg-Anka (1924), to him as an expression of gratitude. Although Sorabji experienced <b>racial</b> <b>harassment</b> in his youth, his homosexuality caused him greater trouble; he wrote to Holliday that he had once been blackmailed over it.|$|E

25|$|However, it {{has been}} argued that one of Lee's failings as {{president}} of Washington College was an apparent indifference to crimes of violence towards blacks committed by students at the college. Historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor notes that students at Washington College formed their own chapter of the KKK and were known by the local Freedmen’s Bureau to attempt to abduct and rape black schoolgirls from the nearby black schools. There were also at least two attempted lynchings by Washington students during Lee’s tenure.

25|$|A {{major problem}} on the estate in the past was the {{presence}} of joyriders exploiting the straight main roads that {{ran the length of}} the estate. To tackle this, the HAT employed a traffic calming scheme in April 1998. This was done by installing speed bumps, mini-roundabouts and narrowing road lanes. An issue for residents was securing their property from thieves and so the HAT provided burglar alarms and car steering locks. In February 1999, 59 Home Wardens were introduced to the estate to help protect property and forge links between residents and community groups. As they had no law enforcement powers, funding was provided for two extra police officers for three years. A centre was also set up for dealing with any reports of <b>racial</b> <b>harassment</b> on the estate.|$|E
40|$|Any useful {{discussion}} of how <b>racial</b> violence and <b>harassment</b> should be tackled needs {{to be based on}} a thorough understanding of the nature and scale of the problem. The official figures on the extent of <b>racial</b> violence and <b>harassment</b> in Britain are based on police statistics and the British Crime Survey. This book offers a critical evaluation and assessment of these sources, to see if the problem has, as some claim, increased. The report reviews a number of small-scale studies in local areas where <b>racial</b> violence and <b>harassment</b> is known to be a problem. Detailed questioning about the experience of <b>racial</b> violence and <b>harassment</b> - particularly 'low-level' harassment - among a sample of African Caribbean and South Asian respondents then reveals: where such incidents take place; who the perpetrators are; what, if anything, the people subject to such violence and harassment try to do about it; {{and the extent to which}} people's lives are affected, beyond the actual harassment that takes place. The report concludes with a {{discussion of}} the key issues involved in addressing the problem more effectively. </p...|$|R

[...] These seamen returned to base, armed themselves with rifles and pistols without authorization and went to the gate to wait.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} sexual harassment, in its modern understanding, is a {{relatively}} new one, dating from the 1970s onwards; although other related concepts have existed prior to this in many cultures. The term sexual harassment was used in 1973 in [...] "Saturn's Rings", a report authored by Mary Rowe to the then-President and Chancellor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) about various forms of gender issues. Rowe has stated that she believes she was not the first to use the term, since sexual harassment was being discussed in women's groups in Massachusetts in the early 1970s, but that MIT may have been the first or one of the first large organizations to discuss the topic (in the MIT Academic Council), and to develop relevant policies and procedures. MIT at the time also recognized the injuries caused by <b>racial</b> <b>harassment</b> and the harassment of women of color, which may be both racial and sexual. The President of MIT also stated that harassment (and favoritism) are antithetical to the mission of a university as well as intolerable for individuals.|$|E
