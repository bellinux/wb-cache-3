Four versions of the portrait are attributed to Stuart, and additional copies were painted by other artists for display in U.S. government buildings. In 1803, Stuart opened a studio in Washington, D.

[...] Herter Brothers executed plasterwork, paneling and cabinetwork for several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public <b>rooms,</b> helping to turn a stylistic hodge-podge of interiors into a unified Neo-Classical whole.

50|$|The Blue Room {{had long}} been {{decorated}} with {{a table in the}} center and other furniture around the edge. Boudin continued this historic decorative scheme, but this required him to find a new centerpiece. Although he was able to locate a mahogany round table with white marble top purchased during the Monroe administration, he disliked its heavy look and asked that it be covered. Sister Parish, an interior decorator and Kennedy friend who had refurbished <b>the</b> private <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House, designed a gold-colored silk damask cloth with tassels to cover the table. Mrs. Kennedy was unhappy that the Monroe table was concealed, and Boudin soon swapped it out for a modern table (retaining the Parish covering).|$|R
25|$|Due to {{security}} concerns about an assassination attempts, President Ronald Reagan lit the National Christmas Tree via remote control from the East <b>Room</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House in 1981, 1982, and 1983. Supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment and increased {{aid for the}} poor protested at the event. The lights on the 1981 tree suffered from faulty wiring, {{and could not be}} lit on the final night of the event (January 1, 1982). 1981 also marked the beginning of a number of changes to the Pageant of Peace. The petting zoo was canceled due to cost concerns, {{but for the first time}} each state or territory donated the ornaments to be used on their tree lining the Pathway of Peace. A request to honor Vietnam War veterans during the ceremony was turned down to keep the focus on Christmas. A new contractor, Westport Marketing Group, was also hired to manage the tree lighting ceremony. Westport changed the ceremony so that fewer guests sat on stage. This made room for more performers. Westport also suggested that more national celebrities be invited to perform as well to turn the event into a national (rather than local) event and boost the appeal to a national audience. Westport suggested even more radical reductions in the number of guests and field seating as well as elimination of the Yule log in 1982. There was also discussion of moving the entire event into the White House, but these suggestions were not acted on.|$|E

5000|$|Electra Havemeyer Webb {{began to}} collect [...] "in earnest" [...] in 1911, {{more than a}} decade before <b>the</b> {{founding}} <b>of</b> Colonial Williamsburg and nearly a half century before authentic American antiques would return to <b>the</b> major <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. When she began to gather <b>the</b> remnants <b>of</b> an earlier America there was no National Register of Historic Places. Americans had yet to understand that their heritage was interesting and worthy of preservation. Before there was Henry Francis Dupont's Winterthur, Henry Ford's Greenfield Village, or even the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, Electra Havemeyer Webb was an ambitious and well-known collector of Americana. She worked with the finest antique dealers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> era, including Edith Halpert and Harry Newman, to assemble encyclopedic and irreplaceable collections of American material culture. <b>The</b> honesty <b>of</b> everyday objects spoke to Mrs. Webb, and she used her significant resources to ensure their preservation.

60|$|A {{few hours}} later he was ushered through <b>the</b> public <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House to a more secluded part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> household.

He reached out a long arm to Brant, who stood hesitatingly on the threshold, grasped his hand, and led him into the room. It had a single, large, elaborately draped window and a handsome medallioned carpet, which contrasted with the otherwise almost appalling simplicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> furniture. A single plain angular desk, with a blotting pad and a few sheets of large foolscap upon it, a waste-paper basket and four plain armchairs, completed the interior with a contrast as simple and homely as its long-limbed, black-coated occupant. Releasing <b>the</b> hand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general to shut a door which opened into another apartment, the President shoved an armchair towards him and sank somewhat wearily into another before the desk. But only for a moment; the long shambling limbs {{did not seem to}} adjust themselves easily to the chair; the high narrow shoulders drooped to find a more comfortable lounging attitude, shifted from side to side, and the long legs moved dispersedly. Yet the face that was turned towards Brant was humorous and tranquil.|$|R

Craig said that the White House ultimately decided to re-administer the oath out of an abundance of caution. Craig added that [...] "the oath of office was administered effectively and... the President was sworn in appropriately... But the oath appears in the Constitution itself." [...] No Bible was present during the retake of the inauguration.|$|E

The tours that were conducted in December displayed the White House's Christmas decor. In addition, she instituted a series of performances by artists at the White House in varied American traditions, from opera to bluegrass; among the guests were The Carpenters in 1972. These events were described as ranging from [...] "creative to indifferent, to downright embarrassing". When they entered the White House in 1969, the Nixons began inviting families to non-denominational Sunday church services in the East <b>Room</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House.
