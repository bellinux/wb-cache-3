25|$|When {{a company}} lists its {{securities}} {{on a public}} exchange, the money paid by the investing public for then newly issued shares goes directly to the company (primary offering) {{as well as to}} any early private investors who opt to sell all or a portion of their holdings (secondary offerings) as part of the larger IPO. An IPO, therefore, allows a company to tap into a wide pool of potential investors to provide itself with capital for future growth, <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> or working capital. A company selling common shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. Those investors must endure the unpredictable nature of the open market to price and trade their shares. After the IPO, when shares trade freely in the open market, money passes between public investors. For early private investors who choose to sell shares as part of the IPO process, the IPO represents an opportunity to monetize their investment. After the IPO, once shares trade in the open market, investors holding large blocks of shares can either sell those shares piecemeal in the open market, or sell a large block of shares directly to the public, at a fixed price, through a secondary market offering. This type of offering is not dilutive, since no new shares are being created.|$|E
500|$|Mexico was strife-torn in {{the early}} 1860s, as it often {{had been in the}} fifty years since independence. [...] France, Spain, and the United Kingdom joined {{together}} to intervene in 1861 on the pretext of protecting their nationals, and to secure <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> [...] Spain and the British soon withdrew, but France remained. Distracted by civil war, Seward could do little to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, and in 1864, French emperor Napoleon III set his cousin, Archduke Maximilian of Austria on the Mexican throne, with French military support. When this became an issue in the U.S., Seward used strident language publicly, but was privately conciliatory toward the French.|$|E
500|$|Bryan {{quickly became}} {{prominent}} in Lincoln {{as a lawyer}} and a public speaker, becoming known as the [...] "Boy Orator of the Platte". [...] In 1890, he agreed to run for Congress against William J. Connell, a Republican, who had won the local congressional seat in 1888. [...] At that time, Nebraska was suffering hard times as many farmers had difficulties making ends meet due to low grain prices, and many Americans were discontented with the existing two major political parties. [...] As a result, disillusioned farmers and others formed a new far-left party, which {{came to be known}} as the Populist Party. [...] The Populists proposed both greater government control over the economy (with some calling for government ownership of railroads) and giving the people power over government through the secret ballot, direct election of United States Senators (who were, until 1913, elected by state legislatures), and replacement of the Electoral College with direct election of the president and vice president by popular vote. [...] Party members in many states, including Nebraska, demanded inflation of the currency through issuance of paper or silver currency, allowing easier <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> After a candidate backed by the nascent Populists withdrew, Bryan defeated Connell for the seat by 6,700 votes (nearly doubling Connell's 1888 margin), receiving support from the Populists and Prohibitionists.|$|E

5000|$|Panyarring was the {{practice}} of seizing and holding persons until the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> or resolution of a dispute which became a common activity along the Atlantic coast of Africa in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Panyarring though is different from this practice as it involves the forced seizure of persons when a debt was not repaid.|$|E
