Soybean oil is {{the primary source of}} biodiesel in the United States, accounting for 80% of domestic biodiesel production. Soybeans have also been used since 2001 as fermenting stock in the manufacture of a brand of vodka. In 1936, Ford Motor Company developed a method where soybeans and fibers were rolled together producing a soup which was then pressed into various parts for their cars, from the distributor cap to knobs on the dash board. Ford also informed in public relation releases that in 1935 over five million acres (20,000 km) was dedicated to growing soybeans in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Print {{heads are}} {{available}} in 203 dpi, 300 dpi and 600 dpi resolution options. Each dot is addressed independently and when a dot is electronically addressed it immediately heats up to a pre-set, (adjustable) temperature. The heated element immediately melts the wax or <b>resin</b> based <b>ink</b> {{on the side of}} the ribbon film facing the substrate and this process, in combination with the constant pressure being applied by the print head locking mechanism immediately transfers it onto the substrate. When a dot ‘turns off’ that element of the print head immediately cools down and that part of the ribbon thereby stops melting/printing. As the substrate comes out of the printer it is completely dry and can be used immediately.|$|R

The helical channel shape’s main advan-tage is its constant curvature radius which generates a constant electric field gradient. The pre-sented separator was fabricated by extruding a sacrificial ink on rotating spindles using a com-puter-controlled robot. After being assembled, connected to the reservoir and encapsulated in epoxy <b>resin,</b> the <b>ink</b> was removed to create a helical microchannel. The resulting device was tested by circulating polystyrene microbeads of 4 and 10 µm diameter through its channel using a volt-age of 900 VDC. The particles were separated with efficiencies of 94. 0 % and 92. 5 %, respectively. However, roughness {{in some parts of the}} channel and connections that had larger diameters compared to the channel created local electric field gradients which, doubtless, hindered separa-tion.

In this work castor oil (CO) and palm olein (PO) polyols were synthesized and partially used as renewable feedstock for the manufacturing of polyurethane plasticizing <b>resin</b> for printing <b>ink</b> applications. The chemical structure of the prepared polyols and polyurethanes were characterized using IR spectra and GPC and their solubility in common solvents was tested. As well, properties such as flexibility, mechanical properties, optical properties, heat seal and freeze resistance of these prepared printing inks were determined. The results indicated that the prepared printing inks from 50 % synthesized polyurethane have high thermal stability, adhesion and excellent freeze resistance.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of pH value on the plastic water-based gravure ink, the primary ink that is dispersed by high-speed grinding is maxed with good- compatible water-based resin (solution resin) and promoter in proportion. Getting the different pH value of ink samples by two methods, one way is the Amine neutralizers were added in the ink samples, the other is alkaline substances of the ink samples were volatilized by raising temperature. The influence of the pH value to the property of ink was analyzed by testing the pH value, viscosity, stetting, and glossiness of the proofs. The result indicates that changing the pH value of ink will affect the viscosity of ink. The pH value can influent {{the release of the}} <b>resin</b> in the <b>ink</b> to the solvent, so the dryness of ink was also influenced. The pH value of water-based ink has a certain influence to the glossiness of the proofs...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{implementation of}} renewable {{resources in the}} chemical industry is mainly driven by environmental reasons. However, as a rather underestimated side-effect of this development, new chemical building blocks have become available, which are not economically accessible from petrochemical sources. In this respect, itaconic acid has gained considerable attention, as it is biotechnologically produced from carbohydrates on an industrial scale. Its trifunctional structure allows for the synthesis of new polymers, like polyitaconates or related co-polymers which have been extensively studied in the past. Polyesters derived from this unsaturated dicarboxylic acid {{on the other hand}} have only recently started to gain interest, despite myriad potential applications, such as UV-curing <b>resins</b> for coatings, <b>inks</b> or adhesives or thermally curing compositions to name but a few. This work aims to review the most relevant work in the field of polyesters derived from itaconic acid and to show the unique properties of these materials and identify the potential for further research in this area...|$|R
40|$|Isocyanates are {{included}} into a class with an extreme commercial importance because {{their use in}} the manufacture of polyurethanes. Polyurethanes are used in several applications such as adhesives, coatings, foams, thermoplastics <b>resins,</b> printing <b>inks,</b> foundry moulds and rubbers. Agglomerated cork stoppers are currently used for still wines, semi-sparkle and gaseous wines, beer and cider. Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is presently the isocyanate used in the production of polyurethane based adhesive in use due to its lowest toxicity comparing with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) previously employed. However, free monomeric TDI or MDI, depending on the based polyurethane, can migrate from agglomerated cork stoppers to beverages therefore it needs to be under control. The presence of these compounds are usually investigated by HPLC with Fluorescence or UV-Vis detector depending on the derivatising agent. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode Array Detector (UPLC-DAD) method is replacing HPLC. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine which method is better to analyze isocyanates from agglomerated cork stoppers, essentially TDI to quantify its monomer. A Design of Experiments (DOE) with three factors, column temperature, flow and solvent, at two levels was done. Eight experiments with three replications and two repetitions were developed. Through an ANOVA the significance of the factors was evaluated and the best level’s factors were selected. As the TDI has two isomers and in this method these two isomers were not always separated an ANOVA with results of resolution between peaks was performed. The Design of Experiments reveals to be a suitable statistical tool to determine the best conditions to quantified free isocyanates from agglomerated cork stoppers to real foodstuff. The best level’s factors to maximize area was column temperature at 30 ºC, flow to 0, 3 mL/min and solvent 0, 1 % Ammonium Acetate, to maximize resolution was the same except the solvent that was 0, 01 % Ammonium Acetate.

40|$|Abstract. Inkjet Printing is a {{non-contact}} printing, {{and it has}} wide adaptability, {{high speed}} and intelligence, low cost and no pollution as well, so {{it is the best}} printing form for food and drug surface printing. Drops control technology {{is the key to the}} development of ink-jet printing technology, and viscosity is also the key factor that influences the drop state. In this article, the samples which have different viscosity are got by the way of adding different levels of <b>resin</b> to the <b>ink.</b> Drop state is observed through drops observatory, the speed, tail length and volume are measured by it in order to evaluate the influence of viscosity to ink-jet drop state. The result shows that viscosity has big influence to ink-jet drop state, if the viscosity is larger, the speed of drops is smaller. The ink with high viscosity is easier to gather into a circular drop than that with small viscosity. If the viscosity more than 13. 2 mPa·s, the rupture time and tail length of the drop increases along with the increase of viscosity. When the viscosity is 10. 3 mPa·s, its rupture time is 80 µs and the ink soon gather into a circular drop under the action of cohesion, its drop state is the best...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{arrangement of}} ductular structures formed by oval cells in rats fed 2 -acetylaminofluorene (2 -AAF) was studied by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) of biliary tract casts and light microscopy of sections of liver injected with india ink via the biliary tract. Both <b>resin</b> and india <b>ink</b> were well injected up to bile ductules, and the findings of each method correlated with each other. By the second week after 2 -AAF administration, a few oval cells appeared in the periportal areas forming ductular structures which connected with the portal bile ducts. At the 4 th week, increased ductular structures occupied {{two thirds of the}} lobule and formed networks communicating with each other, and with the portal bile ducts. At the 8 th week, such ductular structures were compressed around hyperplastic nodules and appeared like a basket in biliary casts examined by SEM. Although a histochemical study of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase revealed activity both on the luminal side of the ductular structures and hepatocytes in hyperplastic nodules, no transition was observed between these two cell populations. These results suggest that oval cells have characteristics more similar to those of biliary epithelia than of hepatocytes, and have no relation to the development of hyperplastic nodules. </p...|$|R
40|$|Adipocyte {{dysfunction}} may be {{a critical}} link between obesity and insulin resistance {{as a result of}} abnormal fat storage and mobilization. Adipocytes uniquely secrete adipokines and cytokines, such as leptin and TNFα, wich promote insulin sensitivity. Previously we reported insulin-signaling related altered gene expression in animals exposed to 2 -Aminoanthracene (2 AA). 2 AA is an aminosubstituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon used in manufacturing dyes, chemicals, <b>inks,</b> <b>resins,</b> and polyurethanes. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the inflammation related effects of 2 AA exposure from gestation to postnatal period on dams that ingested 2 AA. To examine 2 AA effects, pregnant dams were assigned into dose regimens of 2 AA. Dams were fed 2 AA contaminated diet during the period of gestation and postpartum. The expression of key gene transcripts reported to be important in mediating inflammatory processes was examined via quantitative RT-PCR. Histologic examination of adipose tissue (AT) was also carried out to understand the anatomy of AT due to 2 AA exposure during gestation and two weeks postpartum. Examination of the adipose tissue for microscopic changes revealed no alterations between control and low-dose animals. However, AT of the high-dose animals was infiltrated by increased numbers of CD 68 +mononuclear cells (macrophages) and small numbers of eosinophils and mast cells, consistent with inflammation. In addition, analysis of the mRNA expression of cytokines and adipokines demonstrated the importance of inflammation in AT dysfunction. For instance, TNFα, LEPTIN and IL- 6 transcripts were relatively more expressed in the low dose animals than in the high dose and control rats. At the protein level, however, high amounts of cytokines were noted. The effects of 2 AA on pregnant dams appear to be more pronounced in the high dose group than in the low dose group, possibly indicating increased susceptibility of rat offspring within this group to elicit a diabetic-type response...|$|R
