40|$|In New Zealand, {{dairy cows}} {{generally}} calve {{in the spring}} and produce milk through spring, summer and autumn. This is arranged this way to ensure that there is ample good quality grass available when the cows require it most; in early lactation. In the winter most farmers dry all their cows off to let them gain strength and condition in anticipation of the next calving and lactation. The feeding and tending of the cows during the winter period is generally called “wintering” Cows in the Southern parts of New Zealand are mainly wintered on brassica crops. This system has been inherited from the few dairy farmers that were there before the dairy influx in the nineties. Typically cows were farmed at 2. 5 cows per hectare (“one cow to the acre”) and the cows were wintered on brassica crops on the <b>milking</b> <b>platform</b> (home farm). Fifteen to twenty percent of the <b>milking</b> <b>platform</b> was sown out in kale or Swedes and new pasture was sown afterwards. The soil had enough time to restore under pasture and this system worked reasonably well. It did not take long for the newly imported farmers to work out the opportunity cost of having part of the <b>milking</b> <b>platform</b> out of the grazing round for winter crops. Wintering the cows off the <b>milking</b> <b>platform</b> and increasing the stocking rate to about three cows to the hectare on the home block was considered to be a better option. Cows were sent off the <b>milking</b> <b>platform</b> during winter to a runoff. The crop rotation on such a runoff can be as intense as fifty per cent of the land in brassica’s at any given time. Most of these runoffs have previously been used for sheep farming with nearly the whole farm in grass. During the first crop rotation the whole farm can be introduced to brassica crops before the negative effects of this practice are noticed. A common practice is to plough up enough area for winter feed, use the ground for wintering for two years, put the paddocks back into grass and plough up the next lot. This first crop rotation can take up to eight or ten years, but at some stage the first cropping round will run out and paddocks that have had brassica crops in them before will have to be used again. This is when the negative effects are felt in regard to soil structure damage and weed infestation. The viability and sustainability of this system is now in question. This report describes an investigation into the physical, environmental, animal health/ welfare and financial implications of an alternative to this system...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the issues pertaining to runoff ownership in Canterbury, focusing particularly on reasons for purchase, how the runoff was used, and profitability. Six case study farmers were selected and interviewed, following identification by industry key informants. Initial selection criteria were runoff ownership, and availability of comprehensive and reliable information. Final criteria included achieving diversity of situation in respect to land type and farming system. The runoffs were evaluated according to the net benefits they contributed to the overall dairying operation. Achieving greater business control was the major driver for runoff purchase. A secondary driver related to increased profitability opportunities, including both operating returns and capital gains. Farmers also enjoyed the diversity of operations and decision making challenges that runoff ownership provided. All case study farmers used their runoff for wintering purposes and supplying feed to the <b>milking</b> <b>platform</b> for lactating cows. Four farmers used the runoff for rearing their heifers, with three farmers pursuing dairy beef, carrying-over empty cows, and cash cropping activities. Three farmers also sold surplus feed on the open market. The relative amount of runoff area to <b>milking</b> <b>platform</b> area ranged from 0. 4 to 0. 98 ha (per Iha of <b>milking</b> <b>platform).</b> The value of runoff capital invested ranged from $ 1, 540 to $ 8, 645 per lactating cow (on peak numbers). These ratios were dependent on both the management activities undertaken on the runoff and the runoff's resources. Annual operating returns (EBIT) ranged between 3. 4 % and 6. 0 % for the 2004 / 05 year. These cash rates of return are comparable to returns generated through other capital appreciating assets. Capital gains ranged from 15. 5 % to 23. 9 % compounded per annum, from the year of purchase through to 2005, net of development expenditure. Currently these operating returns are less than the interest costs incurred, assuming the current market value is totally funded with debt capital. Runoff cashflow levels were found to become self-funding after a small period of time. Due to capital gains, a 4 % cash return on current market values is considerably greater when expressed across the historical purchase price (debt employed). The financial success of future runoff investments will depend strongly on market price movements for runoff-grown feed and the levels of capital gains that are achieved...|$|R

40|$|As {{dairy farming}} {{businesses}} expand and {{the push for}} productivity improvement continues there is increasing pressure to maximise milksolids production from the <b>milking</b> <b>platform.</b> A consequence of this production drive {{is the need for}} off-farm grazing for replacement stock and cows during winter.

40|$|In Canterbury, the {{majority}} of dairy farmers use their land as an intensive <b>milking</b> <b>platform</b> and rely on feed and grazing from other sources for dry cows and young stock. As a result, the Canterbury cropping sector is {{closely linked to the}} dairy sector. This thesis investigates the integration and complementarities that can occur when arable farmers take a further step and convert part of their land to an intensive <b>milking</b> <b>platform.</b> In the seven case studies analysed, the drivers of land-use change were a combination of profitability, personal lifestyle needs and risk management through diversification of income. Dairy farming was attractive because it was a simple system with a reduced workload compared to their current crop systems. Lower order sharemilkers and/or managers responsible for dairy staff were crucial to meet the lifestyle needs of the farmer. In all cases the farmers had the desire to continue cropping as it was the farming system they enjoyed. There was evidence that diversification did reduce volatility of income. The other benefits achieved through the synergies resulting from vertical integration were reduced transaction costs through reliable crop markets and access to dairy feed. The case study farmers had a higher stocking rate and per cow production than industry averages. Some of the case study farms had adjoining or overlapping crop and dairy land, whereas others had separate land parcels. The case studies were categorised by land sharing and levels of complementarity. While adjoining land may increase some synergistic benefits the level of interaction can vary. A framework was developed for the case studies allowing them to be categorized into three groups: complementary due to spatial separation, integration through amalgamation and in-transition where the case study farm was transitioning away from diversification and into full dairy farming. The case study farmers saw mixed farming as a success, six of the seven case study farmers aimed to continue both crop and dairy farming. All the case study farmers were intensive crop farmers before conversion and therefore had a specialised skill-set related to cropping. These existing skills allow the case study farmers to maintain cropping within their operations. There are implications as to whether the complementarities will pass through to the next generation if the skill-set in crop is not passed on...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} the simulation and modelling of an automatic speed control system of a rotary farm dairy. At present some rotary farm dairies {{can only have}} their speed changed by physically changing the gear ratios between the driving motor and the platform. Others have a manual control to vary {{the speed of the}} driving motor. To use the rotary farm dairy more efficiently the milking pulsators need to be used effectively. Usually near the exit of the dairy there will be some cows finished milking and the pulsators will be idle. The simulation results proved that by automatically controlling the speed of rotation the number of idle pulsators could be reduced and the efficiency of the dairy farm could be increased. The process variable in the farm dairy control problem is not well defined. The speed controller needs to know more than just how many pulsators are idle or active it also needs to know where they are in relation to the exit of the rotating platform. The most difficult part of the control system was representing the state of the system. There is a lack of symmetry around the set-point, which was countered by putting more weight on the pulsators near the exit.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{behavioral}} responses of milked cows and throughput performance of a herringbone milking parlor of capacity 2 x 10. For this purpose, 120 cows, of which about 100 milked, housed in an existing undivided compost bedded-pack barn (manure with minimum straw tilled on a daily basis), were investigated. Cows were milked three times per day in a 30 -degree 2 x 10 herringbone parlor. A real-time monitoring system was designed, developed and installed to obtain the required information. A steady trend of difference between entrance and exit routines in cows from the left and right <b>platform</b> of the <b>milking</b> parlor was found. The most likely reason is the difference in illumination between the two <b>milking</b> <b>platforms,</b> and also direction of the exit traffic. Groups of cows who turned at 180 ˚ had longer exit time, irrespective of the shorter distance covered. Milking duration within the range of the three milkings showed a clearly defined rate. Morning milking was of the shortest duration, although the one-time absolute milk yield is the highest in the morning. The most likely explanation for it is the higher oxytocin release in the early hours of the day as a result of the reduced impact of the surrounding stress factor. Often cows from the left platform would come into contact with those from the right platform and delay movement to the selection gate. Therefore, an optically impenetrable barrier would be required to be installed on the gat...|$|R
40|$|Traditional dairy {{wintering}} {{practice in}} the lower South Island of New Zealand has been to graze brassica crops in situ. This practice has been under increasing scrutiny from local Regional Councils due to the relatively high nitrogen (N) leaching losses from this component of the whole farm system. Alternative wintering options to reduce N leaching losses that are currently available to farmers (such as barns and permanent wintering pads) are high cost and involve a large capital investment. In this work a new wintering system (termed a ‘portable pad’) was developed for use on support blocks (which can be located many kilometres from the <b>milking</b> <b>platform)</b> as an interim measure for reducing N leaching losses that is low cost and low input. This system is designed as a mitigation strategy that is available for use immediately while research investigates more permanent solutions. This system is a hybrid of the traditional crop grazing system and an off-paddock system, where effluent is captured. It makes use {{of the advantages of}} each of the original systems utilising the low cost feed source of the brassica crops, grazed in situ, while also utilising the benefits of duration controlled grazing with its associated effluent capture and irrigation at low rates. The aim of the research was to generate whole system N leaching loss values {{for each of the three}} farm systems investigated (crop wintering, deep-litter wintering barn, and portable pad). Field and laboratory research was conducted to fill identified knowledge gaps such that system N loss values could be estimated. OVERSEER Nutrient Budget software tool was used in conjunction with measured and modelled (APSIM) data to simulate whole farm N leaching loss values for the three farm systems investigated.

In 2008, {{to assess the impact}} of the Lincoln University Dairy Farm (LUDF), a survey was sent to 622 farmers located in the LUDF extension catchment. Responses totalled 146 (24 % response rate). The mean age of respondents was 45 years with 77 % having some form of tertiary education. Respondents had higher milksolids production per cow (419 kg) and per hectare (1441 kg) than the Canterbury averages (381 kg and 1224 kg respectively). Most respondents (86 %) identified themselves as using moderate levels of supplementary feeding (Systems 2, 3, 4). Nearly 70 % of respondents attended at least one focus day (field day) over a three year period. Most attended to learn about grazing and animal management, to benchmark against the LUDF from a production and financial standpoint, and to learn about environmental management. Focus day attendees had larger operations and higher levels of productivity than those who never attended. Over 68 % of respondents visited the farm website each year, with some visiting more than 30 times, but mainly to view benchmarking data rather than to learn about new technologies Of the technologies promoted by the LUDF, 82 % of farmers had adopted low grazing residuals and 74 % had re-grassed paddocks based on monitoring. Lower numbers had adopted synchronisation of heifers to calve a week before the main herd (29 %), aggressive hormone intervention for non-cycling (42 %) and a nil induction policy (36 %). Over 70 % felt that the adoption of some of the LUDF technologies had made their farm management easier. Twenty three farmers were willing to place an economic value on the adoption of LUDF practices. These ranged from $ 50, 000 per year to $ 1, 000, 000 per year.

40|$|To {{maintain}} a predominantly pasture-based system, the large herd milked by automatic milking rotary {{would be required}} to walk significant distances. Walking distances of greater than 1 -km are associated with an increased incidence of undesirably long milking intervals and reduced milk yield. Complementary forages can be incorporated into pasture-based systems to lift total home grown feed in a given area, thus potentially ‘concentrating’ feed closer to the dairy. The aim of this modelling study was to investigate the total land area required and associated walking distance for large automatic milking system (AMS) herds when incorporating complementary forage rotations (CFR) into the system. Thirty-six scenarios consisting of 3 AMS herds (400, 600, 800 cows), 2 levels of pasture utilisation (current AMS utilisation of 15. 0 t dry matter [DM]/ha, termed as moderate; optimum pasture utilisation of 19. 7 t DM/ha, termed as high) and 6 rates of replacement of each of these pastures by grazeable CFR (0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %) were investigated. Results showed that AMS cows were required to walk greater than 1 -km when the farm area was greater than 86 ha. Insufficient pasture could be produced within a 1 km distance (i. e. 86 ha land) with home-grown feed (HGF) providing 43 %, 29 %, and 22 % of the metabolisable energy (ME) required by 400, 600, and 800 cows, respectively from pastures. Introduction of pasture (moderate) : CFR in AMS at a ratio of 80 : 20 can feed a 400 cow AMS herd, and can supply 42 % and 31 % of the ME requirements for 600 and 800 cows, respectively with pasture (moderate) : CFR at 50 : 50 levels. In contrast to moderate pasture, 400 cows can be managed on high pasture utilisation (provided 57 % of the total ME requirements). However, similar to the scenarios conducted with moderate pasture, there was insufficient feed produced within 1 -km distance of the dairy for 600 or 800 cows. An 800 cow herd required 140 and 130 ha on moderate and high pasture-based AMS system, respectively with the introduction of pasture: CFR at a ratio of 50 : 50. Given the impact of increasing land area past 86 ha on walking distance, cow numbers could be increased by purchasing feed from off the <b>milking</b> <b>platform</b> and/or using the land outside 1 -km distance for conserved feed. However, this warrants further investigations into risk analyses of different management options including development of an innovative system to manage large herds in an AMS farming system...|$|R
40|$|End {{of project}} reportTeagasc {{acknowledges}} with gratitude {{the support of}} Dairy Levy Funds and EU Structural Funds (FEOGA) in financing the research programme. Fluctuation around milk price {{will be the biggest}} factor that the dairy industry will experience over the next number of years. This fluctuation is being driven by fluctuation on the world dairy markets. In the past, when intervention was a much bigger feature of the CAP regime, the fluctuation in world markets had little effect on the EU price. This was because the Intervention system bought product from the market when prices were depressed and placed products on the world market when the price rose. This in effect meant that the CAP regime was having a regulatory effect on the world market as well as the EU markets. An example of the type of fluctuation observed on the world market can be gleamed from the Fonterra milk price in 2006 - 2007 ($ 4. 50 /kg (MS) milk solid) versus 2007 - 2008 ($ 7. 90 /kg MS). This corresponds to a 76 % increase in price in 1 year. For the Dairy Industry in Ireland to prosper under these conditions all sectors will be required to be as efficient as possible from the farm, processing and marketing sectors. This report deals with; (1) Milk payment (2) Optimum milk production systems and (3) Seasonality of milk supply. (1) Milk payment systems in Ireland currently do not adequately reward high solids quality milk. Virtually all milk payment systems include a positive constant which reward the production of volume rather than the production of protein and fat kilograms. The A+B-C system of milk payment would adequately reward the production of protein and fat {{while at the same time}} correcting for the volume related processing costs. (2) Optimum systems of milk production will be built around the maximization of grass utilization in the future. Grazed grass is the cheapest feed that can be fed to dairy cows. Stocking rates nationally are 1. 74 cows/Ha around the <b>milking</b> <b>platform</b> and therefore when dairy farms are expanding they should do so by increasing stocking rate. The inclusion of supplementary feeds will reduce profitability for the vast majority of dairy farmers and could only possibly lead to increases in profitability when coupled increases in stocking rate. (3) Grass based systems while substantially reducing costs at farm level result in a seasonal milk supply profile. This results in a reduced capacity utilization of the milk processing facilities as well as restricted product port folio. However the production of Winter milk will lead to significant cost increases at farm level and should only be encouraged if the specific product produced would be sufficient to cover the additional costs associated with over winter production. Within spring calving systems milk payment systems should be used to encourage an efficient milk supply profile with a mean compact calving date of mid February...|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand dairy {{industry}} has experienced rapid intensification during recent decades {{in response to}} increasing land values. Incorporating forage crops on the <b>milking</b> <b>platform</b> is a potential strategy to increase dry matter production and milk production for greater profitability. However, in previous studies, intensification has increased the cost of milk production. This has diminished the low-cost competitive advantage that New Zealand dairy producers have had in international markets. Feeding low crude protein forage crops {{has also been shown}} to reduce the nitrogen (N) concentration in cow urine, which may help reduce N leaching. This study used farm system modelling to determine the profitability and N leaching on the 160. 1 ha (effective) Lincoln University Dairy Farm (LUDF) when fodder beet, wheat for feed and sales, and a double crop rotation of maize and oats silage was grown. The cash operating profit was calculated using FARMAX® Professional Dairy, assuming $ 6. 00 /kg MS. The projected N leaching was calculated using Overseer TM (version 6. 2. 0), which is now compulsory for all farms in Canterbury under the Environment Canterbury Land and Water Regional Plan. The only crop scenario that increased profitability was fodder beet. Incorporating 10 ha each of spring and autumn grazed fodder beet increased operating profit by 20. 0 % to $ 4, 782 /ha compared to the existing 100 % pastoral system ($ 3, 984 /ha). The other cropping scenarios had significant decreases in profitability. Incorporating 20 ha of maize and oats silage reduced operating profit by 10. 6 %, despite increased overall dry matter production. This was due to poor feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and increased feed crop expenses. Operating profit reduced by 3. 2 % and 13. 1 % when wheat was grown for feed and sales respectively. The wheat (fed) scenario had similar milk production to the existing scenario, however greater crop expenditure. The wheat (sold) scenario had significantly reduced overall revenue which impacted on profitability. A second simulation with fodder beet was done so than daily intakes were increased to the recommended maximum 6. 0 kg DM/cow/day. Harvested fodder beet was included in the rotation and fed at 4. 0 kg DM/cow/day during mid-lactation when there was no grazed fodder beet available. The total fodder beet area was increased to 33. 9 ha, which increased the operating profit by 34. 8 % to $ 5, 368 /ha. The projected nitrate leaching for the all proposed scenarios increased due to significant nutrient loss from the cropping blocks. The overall N leaching increased from 34 kg N/ha for the existing system to 41 kg N/ha for both the fodder beet (20 ha) and maize/oats silage scenarios. Leaching was 39 and 37 kg N/ha for the wheat (fed) and wheat (sold) scenarios respectively. Leaching increased to 44 kg N/ha when the fodder beet area was increased to 33. 9 ha. It was concluded that fodder beet was the only suitable crop to increase profitability, however the projected increase in N leaching will likely prevent the strategy from being implemented...|$|R

The Ayrshire-sired rotational crosses yielded 4. 8 percent more milk during a 19 -d longer lactation and with a calving interval that was 14 d longer than those sired by Sahiwal. Milk yield for completed lactations of interbred cows was 4. 5 percent less, and milk yield of Brown Swiss crosses was 9. 5 percent more, than the <b>rotational</b> crosses. Livetime <b>milk</b> yields were 48 percent greater for the rotational crosses sired by Ayrshire than by Sahiwal. Interbreds yielded 34 percent less than {{the average of the}} rotational crosses. Over partial lifetimes, the rotational crosses sired by Ayrshire yielded 45 percent more milk than those sired by Sahiwal; the interbreds and the crosses sired by Brown Swiss yielded 34 percent less and 62 percent more milk, respectively, than the mean of the rotational crosses...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo neste trabalho foi verificar a ocorrência de brucelose bovina em vacas leiteiras nos municípios de Unaí e Buritis utilizando-se teste do anel do leite (TAL). Foram analisadas 423 amostras de leite coletadas no período de 5 de fevereiro a 3 de abril de 2014,na plataforma de recepção do laticínio e nas comunidades produtoras de leite. Dessas 423 amostras, 87 foram oriundas do município de Buritis e 336, de Unaí. Das amostras obtidas em Unaí, 200 foram coletadas na plataforma de leite de diferentes regiões do município; 92, da comunidade do Pico; e 44, na Associação do Funil. O TAL foi realizado estratificando-se as amostras positivas em cruzes. Do total de amostras analisadas, 73 apresentaram resultados positivos, correspondendo a 17, 25 % do total. Nas amostras dos municípios de Buritis e Unaí, 18, 30 % e 16, 96 % dos resultados foram positivos, respectivamente. No município de Unaí, a Associação do Funil foi a comunidade com maior ocorrência da doença, 38, 64 %, enquanto na comunidade do Pico a incidência foi de 16, 30 % e nas outras regiões do município, 12, 5 % dos resultados foram positivos. As amostras da Associação do Funil, com 38, 64 % de resultados positivos, são oriundas de pequenas propriedades, produtoras de até 300 L de leite e que armazenam o produto em latões. É provável, portanto, que o baixo volume de leite, a acidificação, a presença de leite com mamite, e até com colostro, tenham contribuído para o aumento de resultados falso-positivos nessa associação. O programa {{nacional de}} prevenção à brucelose deve ser intensificado nas associações de pequenos produtores de leite e nas propriedades com resultado positivo com três cruzes, uma vez que o programa reduz com maior segurança a ocorrência de resultados falsos-positivos,no entanto, deve-se realizar o teste AAT como confirmatório. The {{aim of this}} work was to verify the {{occurrence}} of bovine brucellosis in dairy cows in the municipalities of Unaí and Buritis using the milk ring test (TAL). 423 milk samples collected were analyzed for the period from February 5 to April 3, 2014, at the dairy receiving platform and in the milk producing communities. Of these 423 samples, 87 were derived from the municipality of Buritis and 336 from Unaí. Of the samples derived in Unaí, 200 were collected in the <b>milk</b> <b>platform</b> of {{different regions of the}} municipality; 92 of the community of Pico; and 44 in Associação do Funil. TAL was performed stratifying positive samples in crosses. Of total samples analyzed, 73 showed positive results, corresponding to 17. 25 % of total. In the samples of the municipalities of Buritis and Unaí, 18. 30 % and 16. 96 % of the results were positive, respectively. In the municipality of Unaí, Associação do Funil was the community with the highest occurrence of the disease, 38. 64 %, while in the community of Pico the incidence was of 16. 30 % and in the other regions of the municipality, 12. 5 % of the results were positive. The samples of Associação do Funil, with 38. 64 % of positive results, are from small farms producing up to 300 L of milk and storing the product in cans. It is likely, therefore, that the low volume of milk, acidification, the presence of milk with mastitis, and even with colostrum, have contributed to an increase in false-positive results in this Associação. The national program for prevention of brucellosis should be intensified in the associations of small milk producers and properties with a positive result with three crosses, since the program more safely reduces the occurrence of false-positive results; however, the AAT test should be performed as confirmatory...|$|R
40|$|Background & Objective: Campylobacter can be {{transmitted}} through the raw milk. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter genus and Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) species in raw milk samples. Materials & Methods: In this study, 72 samples of raw milk were collected of the <b>platforms</b> <b>milk</b> in the Amol city in summer. Phenotypic identification of Campylobacter genus and C. jejuni species using microbiology laboratory methods and molecular identification of this bacterium using Multiplex- Polymerase Chain Reaction (M-PCR) were performed. The data was calculated using the SPSS 16. 0 software and the Fisher's exact test (p < 0. 05). Results: Among the 72 samples, 13. 88 % of samples were contaminated with C. jejuni and 2. 77 % were contaminated with Campylobacter genus. The highest prevalence rate for this bacterium was in July (20. 83 %) and the lowest prevalence rate was in September (12. 5 %). The significant difference between the prevalence of the Campylobacter genus and C. jejuni species in raw milk samples in various months of summer was not observed (p = 0. 07). Conclusion: This study showed the raw milk contamination with Campylobacter, and thereby the sanitation in the dairy food production places and the use of fast and accurate method to identify this bacterium is important...|$|R
