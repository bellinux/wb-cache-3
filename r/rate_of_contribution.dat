The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> was progressively increased along {{with the growth of}} Singapore's economy, reaching 25% for both employers and employees in 1985.

The employer contribution rate reverted to the same level as the employee rate until the 1997-1998 Asian Financial Crisis, when the rate for employers was again lowered to 10% for workers 55 years or younger. Since then, the employer contribution rate has been gradually increased, with ongoing economic problems blamed for postponing the reinstatement of the original principle of equal contribution.

The answer is yes and the intuition of the result is as follows : according to portfolio theory, agents should hold two risky assets : (i) savings, the return on which is, in our model, the return on physical capital and (ii) "contributions" which give rights to benefits. The model works under the assumption of one source of uncertainty (technological uncertainty) or two sources (technological and demographical).

Because of the very low rate of extrahepatic cell contribution, detection of X or Y chromosome as a marker of extrahepatic cells after sex-mismatch transplantation seems difficult.

Despite limitations, the current study found that extrahepatic cells can form a cluster of small cells which closely resemble SHPCs in retrorsine-pretreated transplanted rat liver.

The finite element method incorporated the constitutive equation is applied to analyse time-dependant deformation of soft clay layer after the construction of road embankment in the bypass of route 3 in Onga-gun, Fukuoka.

He or she can choose the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> to the fund, the investment in a given number of risky assets, and a security with constant rate of return. The problem of maximizing the probability that the fund assets achieve some prescribed goal before some undesirable lower value, or ruin point, is first considered. Secondly, the problem of minimizing (resp. maximizing) the expected discounted cost of reaching a ruin point (resp. beating a desired objective) is solved. Finally, maximization of utility function when the fund can suddenly terminate is analyzed. The main finding is that optimal investment policies are of constant proportionality type.
