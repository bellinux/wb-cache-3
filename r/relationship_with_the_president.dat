25|$|Clark's major {{overseas}} {{visit of}} her third term was {{a trip to}} the United States in March 2007, where she met with George W. Bush in Washington. Despite her strained <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> they agreed on many issues, including working cooperatively in foreign affairs, commerce and the need for both nations to work toward energy security.|$|E
25|$|She kept a {{low profile}} when {{diplomatic}} necessity or Obama's involvement required it, but maintained an influential <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and in foreign policy decisions. Her first 100days found her travelling over , having no trouble adapting to being a team player subordinate to Obama, and gaining skills as an executive. Nevertheless, she remained an international celebrity with a much higher profile than most Secretaries of State. Her background as an elected official gave her insight into the needs and fears of elected officials of other countries.|$|E
25|$|General Orme {{tried to}} handle the {{continuing}} scandal over the poor quality beef {{as well as other}} administrative problems which he inherited. After investigation, he exonerated Ninian Edwards and his vendors, and placed the blame for the meat problem solely on sub–contractors. Despite Edwards' exoneration and his <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> the Army took control of subsistence at the camp away from Edwards on January 27, 1864. Edwards, a captain in the Union Army, was reassigned as food commissary and treasurer of the prison fund in March 1864.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 90s {{he made the}} {{counterintuitive}} career move of relocating to Korea to develop McKinsey's practice in the region. Barton enjoyed close <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and government of South Korea. He subsequently parlayed those relationships into a role running McKinsey in Korea from 2000-2004 and then McKinsey in Asia from 2004-2009. Barton's experience in Asia ultimately made him a strong candidate in the firm election as global managing director.|$|R
5000|$|Producer Sandy Howard {{described}} George Hamilton before filming as [...] "a fine actor, I'm convinced, and he's a hot commodity these days", {{due in part}} to {{the fact}} he was dating <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> daughter. Reports put his fee around this time at $100,000 a movie. He was drafted into the army but received a 3-A deferral notice on the grounds he was the sole financial provider for his mother. (Hamilton's draft deferment was highly controversial at the time because it was thought that his <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> daughter gave him preferential treatment.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Hamilton {{played a}} cat burgular in MGM's Jack of Diamonds (1967). It was {{produced}} by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was [...] "a hot commodity these days" [...] because he was dating Lyndon Johnson's daughter.

500|$|Meade wrote that, {{since the}} Secretary of State {{would have to}} work closely with Jefferson Davis, Benjamin was likely the person best suited to the position. In {{addition}} to his <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> Benjamin was very close to the Confederate First Lady, Varina Davis, with whom he exchanged confidences regarding war events and the President's health. [...] "Together, and by turns, they could help him over the most difficult days." ...|$|E
500|$|Season 1 {{introduces}} Olivia Pope, her [...] "iron-clad rules", and her {{demands of}} loyalty. Pope works with her battalion of misfits {{that she has}} rescued from assorted affairs of varying amounts of unsavory elements. Episode six, [...] "The Trial", showed {{the evolution of the}} affair between Pope and President Grant. However, the entire first season is strung together by Olivia's management of the Amanda Tanner case about [...] "a former White House staffer who claims she’s had a <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and is carrying his baby". This season presents the beginnings of Beene's constant attempts to manipulate Grant into dumping Pope. The season ends as Pope's and Grant's shared dream of happiness is shattered.|$|E
2500|$|Abel Corbin, a small time speculator, married Virginia Grant, {{the younger}} sister of President Grant. After the marriage, Gould and Fisk {{approached}} Corbin, {{taking advantage of}} his brother-in-law <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> and persuaded Corbin to introduce them to Grant. [...] Gould and Fisk hoped that befriending the President would get them privy information about up and coming government gold sales—information with which they manipulated the market. [...] It worked, resulting in a scandal that undermined the credibility of Grant's presidency and the national economy. [...] Gould and Fisk used their personal appearances with Grant to gain clout on Wall Street in addition to using their insider information.|$|E
500|$|Carlyle group {{featured}} {{prominently in}} Michael Moore's 2003 film Fahrenheit 9-11. [...] The film suggested that The Carlyle Group exerted tremendous influence on U.S. government policy and contracts through their <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president’s</b> father, George H. W. Bush, {{a former senior}} adviser to the Carlyle Group. [...] Additionally, Moore cited <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Bin Laden family. [...] The movie quotes author Dan Briody claiming that the Carlyle Group [...] "gained" [...] from September 11 because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the U.S. Army {{is one of the few}} weapons systems canceled by the Bush administration.|$|R
2500|$|On September 23, 1944, Roosevelt {{gave his}} famous [...] "Fala speech" [...] while campaigning in the 1944 presidential election. Because of Roosevelt's strong <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Tobin, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> {{delivered}} his speech before the Teamster convention.|$|R

2500|$|Upon {{his arrival}} at RAF Northolt on 4 June 1944 he {{received}} an official welcome, and a letter reading [...] "My dear general! Welcome to these shores, very great military events are about to take place!" [...] Later, on his personal train, Churchill informed him that he wanted {{him to make a}} radio address, but when informed that the Americans continued to refuse to recognise his right to power in France, and after Churchill suggested he request a meeting with Roosevelt to improve his <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> de Gaulle became angry, demanding to know why he should [...] "lodge my candidacy for power in France with Roosevelt; the French government exists".|$|E
2500|$|Howard {{had first}} met US President George W. Bush {{in the days}} before the 11 September {{terrorist}} attacks and was in Washington the morning of the attacks. In response to the attacks, Howard invoked the ANZUS Treaty. In October 2001, he committed Australian military personnel to the War in Afghanistan despite widespread opposition. Howard developed a strong personal <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> and they shared often similar ideological positions– including on the role of the United States in world affairs and their approach to the [...] "War on Terror". In May 2003, Howard made an overnight stay at Bush's Prairie Chapel Ranch in Texas, after which Bush said that Howard [...] "...is not only a man of steel, he's showed the world he's a man of heart." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{vice presidential}} {{candidate}} might also be chosen {{on the basis of}} traits the presidential candidate is perceived to lack, or on the basis of name recognition. To foster party unity, popular runners-up in the presidential nomination process are commonly considered. While this selection process may enhance the chances of success for a national ticket, in the past it often insured that the vice presidential nominee represented regions, constituencies, or ideologies at odds <b>with</b> those of <b>the</b> presidential candidate. As a result, vice presidents were often excluded from the policy-making process of the new administration. Many times their <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and his staff were aloof, non-existent, or even adversarial.|$|R
5000|$|Brands {{believes}} that Americans place too much importance {{on the individual}} in the White House. [...] "We have this very interesting <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> where <b>the</b> <b>president</b> {{is supposed to be}} one of us, {{but on the other hand}} he represents everybody so he is sort of above all of us. We make too much of presidents, but we can hardly help ourselves." [...] Though noting the power of the Office of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> has increased greatly since the opening of the twentieth century, when the United States emerged as a significant world power and U.S. foreign policy became far more important, Brands {{believes that}} popular focus on <b>the</b> <b>president</b> is excessive. [...] "We have a cult of <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> where we make too big a deal of the president." ...|$|R

Louis-Dreyfus has received widespread critical acclaim for her performance, winning a record-breaking six Primetime Emmy Awards and two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and receiving five consecutive Golden Globe nominations.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1864, Bragg {{was summoned}} to Richmond for {{consultation}} with Davis. The orders for his new assignment on February 24 read that he was [...] "charged with the conduct of military operations of the Confederate States", but he was essentially Davis's military adviser or chief of staff without a direct command, a post once held by Robert E. Lee. Bragg used his organizational abilities to reduce corruption and improve the supply system. He took over responsibility for administration of the military prison system and its hospitals. He reshaped the Confederacy's conscription process by streamlining {{the chain of command}} and reducing conscripts' avenues of appeal. During his tenure in Richmond, he had numerous quarrels with significant figures, including the Secretary of War, the Commissary General, members of Congress, the press, and many of his [...] fellow generals; the exception to the latter was Robert E. Lee, who treated Bragg politely and with deference and who had, Bragg knew, an exceptionally close <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During {{his tenure}} as dean, he also began {{to aid in the}} {{establishment}} and progress of libraries and library science department in foreign countries. Among these were a program he helped set up in Bogota, Colombia, and Mexico City's Benjamin Franklin Library, where he served as director between 1943 and 1944. [...] Gjelsness later returned to Mexico, resulting in the publication of one of his major works, The American Book in Mexico: A Bibliography of Books by Authors of the United States of America Published in Mexico, 1952-55. For this project, Gjelsness compiled and sorted a list of books written by Americans that were published and sold in Mexico, as well as wrote an introduction regarding publishing and readership in Mexico. In October 1962, he went to Iraq to act as consultant to the President of the University of Baghdad, as part of a Ford Foundation project to develop the University’s libraries. [...] However, he never managed to establish a <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> and seems to have done little other than organise some training on cataloguing and classification for 5 of the Central Library’s staff over a 2-month period in 1963. [...] His appointment was for 2 years, but he had taken sabbatical leave only for a year, and his departure surprised the Foundation.|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} comparison of two {{regimes in the}} Arab Republic of Egypt, namely <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reigns of Hosni Mubarak and Mohamed Morsi. The first chapter analyses the internal factors as the objects of comparison: legitimacy {{and the status of}} army. The second chapter is concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> group of external factors, including the foreign policy of Egypt towards the region and towards the USA, since <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> USA has been a long-term determinant of Egypt's foreign policy towards the region. The biggest difference between the two regimes is considered to be embodied in the position of army, particularly regarding its <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidents.</b> Moreover, there are diverse origins of legitimacy of the regimes and causes of its loss. On the other hand, foreign policy of Egypt did not get through distinctive changes...|$|R
5000|$|The {{night the}} king and queen arrive, Daisy discovers LeHand is having an affair with Roosevelt. LeHand tells a shocked Daisy that their {{respective}} <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> are not his only ones, mentioning Dorothy Schiff and Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd, and that Daisy must accept sharing Roosevelt with other women. At the picnic the next day the king successfully eats a hot dog for a photo op, and Daisy, in a voiceover, states that the visit helped the two countries form a Special Relationship. Daisy rejects Roosevelt's requests to see her until he calls on her in person; they reconcile, and Daisy accepts her role as one of <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> mistresses. As years pass, Daisy watches Roosevelt become frail as a wartime leader; nonetheless everyone, she says, [...] "still looked to him, still seeing whatever it was they wanted to see".|$|R

2500|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} transferred {{her from}} the White House to the Pentagon because they felt she was {{spending too much time}} around Clinton. At the Pentagon, she worked as an assistant to chief Pentagon spokesperson Kenneth Bacon. [...] Lewinsky told co-worker Linda Tripp about her <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> Beginning in September 1997, Tripp began secretly recording their telephone conversations regarding the affair with Clinton. In December 1997, Lewinsky left the Pentagon position. In January 1998, after Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit in the Paula Jones case denying any physical relationship with Clinton, and had attempted to persuade Tripp to lie under oath in that case, Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, adding to his ongoing investigation into the Whitewater controversy. Starr then broadened his investigation beyond the Arkansas land use deal to include Lewinsky, Clinton, and others for possible perjury and subornation of perjury in the Jones case. Tripp reported the taped conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg. She also convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her during their relationship, and not to dry clean what would later become known as [...] "the blue dress". Under oath, Clinton denied having had [...] "a sexual affair", [...] "sexual relations", or [...] "a sexual relationship" [...] with Lewinsky.|$|E

50|$|Khrushchev's boasts about Soviet missile forces {{provided}} John F. Kennedy with a {{key issue}} to use against Richard Nixon in the 1960 U.S. presidential election—the so-called 'missile gap'. But all Khrushchev's (probably sincere) attempts to build a strong personal <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new <b>president</b> failed, as his typical combination of bluster, miscalculation and mishap resulted in the Cuban fiasco. After the Berlin and Cuba crises, tensions tapered off between the two superpowers.|$|R
