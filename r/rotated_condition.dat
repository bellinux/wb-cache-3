40|$|Mental {{rotation}} tasks {{have been}} used to probe the mental imagery of both sighted and visually impaired people. People who have been blind since birth display a response pattern which is qualitatively similar to that of sighted people but tend to respond more slowly or with a higher error rate. It has been suggested that visually impaired people code the stimulus and its (or their own) motion in a different way from sighted people - in particular, congenitally blind people may ignore the external reference framework provided by the stimulus and surrounding objects, and instead use body-centred or movement-based coding systems. What has not been considered before is the relationship between different strategies for tactually exploring the stimulus and the response pattern of congenitally blind participants. Congenitally blind and partially sighted children were tested for their ability to learn and recall a layout of tactile symbols. Children explored layouts of one, three or five shapes which they then attempted to reproduce. On half the trials there was a short pause between exploring and reproducing the layouts. In an aligned condition children reproduced the array from the same position at which they had explored it; in a <b>rotated</b> <b>condition</b> children were asked to move 90 &# 730; round the table between exploring and reproducing the layout. Both congenitally blind and partially sighted children were less accurate in the <b>rotated</b> <b>condition</b> than in the aligned condition. Five distinct strategies used by the children in learning the layout were identified. These strategies interacted with both visual status and age. We suggest that the use of strategies, rather than visual status or chronological age, accounts for differences in performance between children...|$|E

Through the finite element simulation we got rolling technics parameters on the effect of rolled piece and selecting principle, and then created the 3 D model of the equal diameter period of hollow axle with the MCWR.

40|$|The {{distinction}} between different spatial representations in the peripersonal space was examined in two experiments by requiring sighted blindfolded and blind participants {{to remember the}} locations of objects haptically explored. In Experiment 1, object relocation took place from either {{the same position as}} learning -with the same (centred egocentric condition) or 90 °-rotated (rotated egocentric condition) object array- or from a position different from the learning position (allocentric condition). Results revealed that, in both sighted and blind people, distance errors were higher in the allocentric and rotated conditions than in the centred egocentric condition, and that blind participants made more distance errors than sighted subjects only in the allocentric condition. Experiment 2 repeated rotated egocentric and allocentric conditions, while the centred egocentric condition was replaced by a decentred egocentric condition in which object relocation took place from the same position as learning (egocentric) but started from a decentred point. The decentred egocentric condition was found to remain significantly different from the <b>rotated</b> <b>condition,</b> but not from the allocentric condition. Moreover, blind participants performed less well in the allocentric condition, but were specifically impaired. Overall, our results confirm that different types of spatial constraints and representations, including the decentred egocentric one, can be distinguished in the peripersonal space and that blind people are as efficient as sighted in the egocentric and rotated conditions, but they encounter difficulties in recalling locations also in the peripersonal space, especially when an allocentric condition is required...|$|E

The magnitude of tip vortices at the both sides of the disc was different in <b>rotating</b> <b>condition.</b> In the fluid force measurement, lift and drag forces were taken by varying wind speeds, rotational speeds, and angle of attack. Drag and lift forces were found to increase and to be stable as rotation increased.

It {{is well known that}} such sequential skills involve chaining a number of primitive actions together. A robust representation of skills can be formed by chunking together several elements of a sequence. We demonstrate, using a 2 x 6 finger movement task, that during the process of acquiring visuomotor skills the chunking patterns remained unaltered when utilizing an effector dependent representation of the sequence. In the 2 x 6 task, subjects learned a sequence of 12 visual cues displayed as six sets of two elements each and performed finger movements on a keypad. Two experiments Normal-Motor and Normal-Visual were conducted on nine subjects and two observations were collected from each subject. Each experiment consisted of a Normal and a <b>Rotated</b> <b>condition.</b> In the Rotated (Motor and Visual) conditions, subjects were required to rotate the visual cues by 180 degrees and press the corresponding keys. The display sequence was also rotated for the Motor condition, requiring an identical set of effector movements to be performed as in the Normal condition. Chunking patterns were identified using the response times (RTs) for individual sets of the sequence. A pause between set RTs demarcates an ensuing chunk. We demonstrate that usage of an effector dependent representation is supported by the observation of identical chunking patterns between the Normal and Motor conditions, and the lack of similarity in chunking patterns between the Normal and Visual conditions...|$|E

40|$|In a {{stationary}} duct, ribs placed {{at an angle}} oblique to the main flow direction are more effective in heat transfer enhancement than the ribs placed perpendicular to the flow. Obliquely placed ribs, besides tripping the boundary layer, produce secondary flow patterns to increase heat transfer from the surfaces. Ducts rotating about an axis perpendicular to their own also develop secondary flows. These two secondary flows, produced by oblique ribs and rotation, {{interact with each other}} and develop a new heat transfer pattern that is different from those produced by oblique ribs or by rotation alone. This paper uses two types of rib configurations (60 ∘ parallel ribs and 60 ∘ staggered ribs) as turbulence and secondary flow promoters. The local and surface averaged Nusslt numbers are presented for both stationary and <b>rotating</b> <b>conditions.</b> This experimental study is conducted on a two-pass square channel with two opposite rib roughened surfaces (leading and trailing sides).

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation to}} measure the effect of mainstream turbulence on blade platform cooling effectiveness within a linear cascade has been completed. Turbulence grids generate the wide ranges of turbulence intensity, from 0. 72 % to 13 %. To simulate the <b>rotating</b> <b>condition</b> of engine blades, velocity triangle analogy has been adopted. Different size of inclined injection hole plates produces swirl motion of purge flow, which makes three different swirl ratios of 0. 4, 0. 6 and 1. 0. Pressure sensitive paint (PSP) technique is used to obtain detailed film cooling distribution on blade platform. The inlet Reynolds number is 250, 000, and coolant to mainstream flow rate (MFR) is 1. 0 %. By using CO 2 as a foreign gas, density ratio 1. 5 is obtained. Results show the existence of pressure gradient between suction side and pressure side. Horseshoe vortex and passage vortex sweep coolant remarkably, which results in poor film cooling coverage on the blade. Furthermore, {{the strength of the}} two vortexes increases for higher <b>rotating</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, more coolant can cover the platform by increasing turbulence intensity because turbulence can reduce the strength of vortex.

40|$|Purpose: II is {{possible}} to track (he egocentric position of an object during locomotion using cither perceived 3 D layout and self-motion, or the 2 D flow pattern. When perceived 3 D path of self-motion is erroneous, are perceived object locations updated in a way consistent with the erroneous interpretation? Method: The task was to track a previously cued location on the ground during simulated self-motion for 2 s, and then indicate its final position with a cursor. Three types of motion were simulated: movement on a circular path (Curved condition), movement along a straight path (Straight condition), and movement along a straight path while <b>rotating</b> (<b>Rotating</b> <b>condition).</b> Simulated translation and rotation is known to produce an illusion of travel on a curved path under these conditions. Therefore, if position judgments in the <b>Rotating</b> <b>condition</b> {{are based on the}} erroneous interpretation of self-motion, performance should be similar to the Curved condition, but if the 2 D flow is used, performance would be the same as the straight condition. Results: For each condition, the mapping from initial positions to judged final positions was fit to a Euclidean transformation, which was used as a measure of the subjective change in observer position. The translational component of this transformation differed between the Curved and Straight conditions, but not between the <b>Rotating</b> and Straight <b>conditions.</b> Conclusion: Subjects appear to use the 2 D flow pattern to track the egocentric positions of objects, even when these judgments are inconsistent with the perceived path of self-motion. This suggests (hat there is no single interpretation of 3 D layout and self-motion. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{flow field}} inside a modern {{internal}} cooling channel {{specifically designed for}} {{the trailing edge of}} gas turbine blades has been experimentally investigated under static and <b>rotating</b> <b>conditions.</b> The passage is characterized by a trapezoidal cross-section of high aspect-ratio and coolant discharge at the blade tip and along the wedge-shaped trailing edge, where seven elongated pedestals are also installed. The tests were performed under engine similar conditions with respect to both Reynolds (Re = 20, 000) and Rotation (Ro = 0, 0. 23) numbers, while particular care was put in the implementation of proper pressure conditions at the channel exits to allow the comparison between data under static and <b>rotating</b> <b>conditions.</b> The flow velocity was measured by means of 2 D and Stereo-PIV techniques applied in the absolute frame of reference. The relative velocity fields were obtained through a pre-processing procedure of the PIV images developed on purpose. Time averaged flow fields inside the stationary and rotating channels are analyzed and compared. A substantial modification of the whole flow behavior due to rotational effects is commented, nevertheless no trace of rotation induced secondary Coriolis vortices has been found because of the progressive flow discharge along the trailing edge. For Ro = 0. 23, at the channel inlet the high aspect-ratio of the cross section enhances inviscid flow effects which determine a mass flow redistribution towards the leading edge side. At the trailing edge exits, the distortion of the flow path observed in the channel central portion causes a strong reduction in the dimensions of the 3 D separation structures that surround the pedestals...|$|R
40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{is focused on}} heat transfer measurements on internal cooling channels of a high pressure gas turbine blade in static and <b>rotating</b> <b>conditions.</b> A novel rig designed for the specific purpose {{was used to assess}} the heat transfer coefficients on a full internal cooling scheme of an idealized blade. The channel has a multi-pass design. Coolant enters at the blade hub in the leading edge region and move radially outwards inside a two-sided ribbed channel. The second passage is again a two-sided ribbed channel with a trapezoidal cross section of high aspect ratio, while inside the third leg low aspect-ratio cylindrical pin fins are arranged in a staggered configuration to promote flow turbulence. Inside the third passage, the coolant is progressively discharged at the blade trailing edge and finally at the blade tip. The test model differs with respect to the real design only because there is no curvature due to the blade camber. Conversely, the correct stagger angle of the real blade with respect to the rotation axis is preserved. Experiments were performed for static and <b>rotating</b> <b>conditions</b> with engine similar conditions of Re= 21000 and Ro= 0. 074, both defined at the channel inlet.

Designed models need to be “validate” to predict the response of a real bladed disc within the tolerances set by the manufactures and this process is very expensive as well as difficult.
