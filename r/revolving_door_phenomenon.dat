Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the impact of gender, age, marital status, urban conditions, diagnosis, mean period of stay on the first admission, interval between the first and second admissions on the patterns of hospitalization. RESULTS: The variables with the highest predictive power for readmission were the interval between first and second admissions, and the length of stay in the first admission.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Mental health recidivism in the Emergency Room (ER) ties into the <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> as many patients with prior visits to the emergency room tend to make this a frequent pattern (Dhossche & Ghani, 1998). The ER is often the entry point of mental health patients into the mental health care process and many studies have shown that there are various circumstances that lead to mental health recidivism (Arfken et al., 2004). This patient population requires complex interventions before effective treatment can be assessed (Andrew Kolbasovsky, Reich, & Futterman, 2007). The objective {{of this study is to}} use statistical analysis to identify important predictors of recidivism in our patient population and also to increase the awareness on mental health recidivism in the emergency room. This study explores this objective by using sequential steps of descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze the patient population and identify the most significant factors.

The revolving door between business interests and the public sector could subvert the purpose of government so that instead of serving the general welfare, government serves private purposes. The tendency for public officials to jump {{back and forth between}} Congress and the private sector may not be the same for every country. The purpose of this study will be to determine the effect of different forms of government and regulations on the <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> The study collected members of the United States Congress, both Representatives and Senators, and previous members of the British House of Commons who had left their elected office for any reason. From these lists we randomly selected 100 politicians, one set of 100 politicians for the United States and another set of 100 for the United Kingdom. These randomly selected Senators, Representatives, and Members of Parliament make up the data set the analysis is based upon. The criteria used in the study for politicians who utilize the revolving door is someone who worked on a committee that dealt with the an area of business the politician was then involved with after leaving public office. This number includes lobbyists as those who entered business in the area of question. Conclusions: • There is a drastic difference in the United States and the United Kingdom revolving door scores. • This difference could be due to a combination of the different governing systems and different rules concerning the revolving door the two countries implement. • The data reflects that the United States allows more revolving door connections than the United Kingdom. • There is cause for caution against absolute prohibitions because specialized legislators {{are likely to be more}} effective regulators. • Governments must find a balance between specialization and the possibility of abuse and regulatory capture...|$|E
40|$|Healthcare for the Homeless—Houston (HHH) {{received}} a research grant from The Medallion Foundation, Inc. in March 2006 to pilot The Jail Inreach Project, an intensive “inreach” initiative {{to assess the}} impact of providing continuity of mental and primary health care services for homeless individuals who suffer from mental illness and/or substance abuse being released from jail. This pilot project was initiated by HHH, in collaboration with the Harris County Sheriff’s Office and the Mental Health Mental Retardation Authority of Harris County (MHMRA). Those who are flagged as “frequent flyers” and who are diagnosed with a mental illness are referred to the Jail Inreach Project. In order to maximize the effectiveness of the discharge plan, case managers offer the option of meeting the client at the time of release and bring them to the HHH clinic located four blocks from the jail. Participation in both the program and the option for direct release to the care of a case manager are voluntary. ^ The purpose of this study is to determine the outcomes of the Jail Inreach Project and addresses the following objectives: (1) to evaluate the characteristics of inmates that chose to be released from jail to the direct care of an HHH case manager versus those who opt for self release and (2) to determine the number and percent of inmates that are linked to services and relationship with type of release (direct versus indirect), (3) to determine if there is a relationship between outcomes and characteristics and (4) to determine what outcomes are a function of release, controlling for characteristics. Statistical analysis, including frequencies, cross tabulations, chi-square and logistical regression, found that those who opt for self release are six times less likely to be successfully linked to services and that gender is the most significant predictor of choosing self release. Men are far more likely to opt for self release than women engaged in this program. These findings help inform policy and program design and development that addresses the difference in service utilization and successful linkage to services post-incarceration. Successful linkage to services, thus continuity of and access to care, further impact the effects of the <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of mentally ill homeless individuals cycling between the streets, jails and hospital emergency centers. ...|$|E
40|$|With an {{acknowledgement}} to {{both the}} cultural and medical influences in the literature this thesis analyses the experiences of young people receiving in-patient treatment for anorexia nervosa. Due to the physical complications associated with anorexia nervosa {{and the age of}} diagnosis most often being during adolescence {{it is one of the}} few medicalised mental health conditions where specific in-patient treatment centres operate. Patients are often admitted for relatively long periods of time in order for safe weight gain and a behavioural approach is the underlying philosophy for treatment. The medicalisation of the disorder and focus on treatment and restoration of weight has been widely criticised for not acknowledging the societal and cultural factors that led to admission. Despite much research in this area treatment is often unsuccessful with clinicians referring to a <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> <b>phenomenon</b> where young people are discharged and then deteriorate and are readmitted weeks or months later. This is often attributed to the resistance of the young people to treatment or their tenacity and determination to lose weight. There has been no research in to the treatment environments themselves and how access to and use of space within them may contribute to patient outcomes. This thesis addresses this through an interpretative phenomenological account of the lived experience of young people receiving in-patient treatment for anorexia nervosa in the United Kingdom. This approach was used because it is appropriate for examining major life experiences and how people make sense of them. Participants created mixed media posters expressing their experience of the spaces within and outside the centres where they were receiving treatment. The posters were then used as prompts during follow up, in depth, interviews. The data were then analysed both by individual case and by theme. The overarching message from the young people’s experience was that although the treatment centres provided a structure and the facilities of a therapeutic environment, the approaches to access and use of the treatment spaces were restrictive and inhibited the young people’s ability to develop the resilience they required to live fulfilling lives. In particular, the lack of access to outdoor space and the rules and dominance of the treatment teams left the young people feeling deviant and removed from society. This suggests that a more culturally informed treatment environment that enabled the young people to develop resilience would be more therapeutic. This thesis found that the treatment environments did not require structural change in order to become therapeutic in nature but the practices within them do need to change. Moving away from a philosophy of treatment and restoration of weight towards an environment that is more positive and focussed on developing the resilience required to live a fulfilling life could enhance current practice...|$|E
