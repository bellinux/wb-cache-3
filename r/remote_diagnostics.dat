25|$|In psychiatry, pathography has {{developed}} a poor reputation, especially diagnostics that {{have been carried out}} ex post, without the direct examination of the patient. It is even considered unethical (see Goldwater rule). The German psychiatrist Hans Bürger-Prinz {{went so far as to}} state that any <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> constitute a “fatal abuse of psychiatry”. The immense range of mental disorders that Hitler has been credited with over time indicates how inconclusive this method can be (see table). Another example of the deficiencies present in many of the following Hitler-pathographies is an either completely absent or grossly abbreviated discussion of the abundance of publications which have already been submitted on this subject by other authors.|$|E
25|$|OBD II is {{no longer}} only used by {{professionals}} and hobbyists to repair vehicles. OBD II information is commonly used by vehicle telematics devices that perform fleet tracking, monitor fuel efficiency, prevent unsafe driving, {{as well as for}} <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> and by pay-as-you-drive insurance. Although originally not intended for the above purposes, commonly supported OBD II data such as vehicle speed, RPM, and fuel level allow GPS-based fleet tracking devices to monitor vehicle idling times, speeding, and over-revving. By monitoring OBD II DTCs a company can know immediately if one of its vehicles has an engine problem and by interpreting the code the nature of the problem. OBD II is also monitored to block mobile phones when driving and to record trip data for insurance purposes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTimely {{diagnosis}} and early interventions {{are critical to}} improving the long term functioning {{of a child with}} ASD. However, a major challenge facing parents is difficulty in obtaining on-time access to appropriate diagnostic services. To address this need, an imaging technology, NODA® (Naturalistic Observation Diagnostic Assessment), has been successfully developed and field-tested. NODA® includes 1) NODA SmartCapture; a smart-phone based recording system for parents to capture and share in-home video evidence of their child behavior and 2) NODA Connect; a HIPPA compliant web-platform for diagnosticians to conduct <b>remote</b> autism <b>diagnostic</b> assessments based on in-home video evidence of behavior, developmental history and their clinical judgment. In the field study, parents captured and shared videos evidence from their homes via NODA SmartCapture and diagnosticians conducted <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostic</b> assessment via NODA Connect. Results show that parents were able to successfully collect video evidence of behavior as per given prescription and diagnosticians were able to complete <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostic</b> assessments.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades the {{technological}} development of vehicles has evolved rapidly and today almost {{everything in a}} vehicle is controlled by electronic systems. At present time {{there are no signs}} of any weakening regarding this trend. With the maturity of wireless communication technologies it is possible to provide new kind of telematics services. A category of telematics concern vehicle maintenance and these services depend and take advantage of electronic systems in vehicles. <b>Remote</b> vehicle <b>diagnostics</b> is such a service, which provides opportunities to conduct vehicle diagnostics work remotely. For a while now, there has been optimistic expectations on the potential of providing such services to customers among the automotive industry. These expectations have largely been {{based on the assumption that}} <b>remote</b> vehicle <b>diagnostics</b> could prevent breakdowns by detecting vehicle problems at an early stage. However, the true potential have yet to be revealed and manufacturers struggle in finding profitable business models. This master thesis studies <b>remote</b> vehicle <b>diagnostics</b> intended for the commercial vehicle aftermarket. Reasons to why <b>remote</b> vehicle <b>diagnostics</b> services have failed to reach a strong market penetration are outlined and explained. We have found that such services are often based on a weak architectural design. Therefore, this study examines how a suitable software architecture, for an aftermarket <b>remote</b> vehicle <b>diagnostics</b> system, should be designed. We argue that such software architecture should focus on a well-prepared flexible design and cost-effectiveness. This study has used an explorative approach towards <b>remote</b> vehicle <b>diagnostics</b> with a clear connection to the thoughts of “Practical Informatics”. The conclusion of our study is presented as several design principles that together contribute to software architecture suitable for the aftermarket.
