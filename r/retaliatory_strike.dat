5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{strategic}} threat changed dramatically during the period that Zeus was being developed. Originally expected to face only a few dozen ICBMs, a nationwide defense was feasible, although expensive. In 1957, growing fears of a Soviet sneak attack led it to be repositioned {{as a way to}} protect Strategic Air Command's bomber bases, ensuring a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>strike</b> force would survive. But when the Soviets claimed to be building hundreds of missiles, the US faced the problem of building enough Zeus missiles to match them. The Air Force suggested they close this missile gap by building more ICBMs of their own instead. Adding to the debate, a number of technical problems emerged that suggested Zeus would have little capability against any sort of sophisticated attack.|$|E
5|$|Stone recovered, and was {{released}} from UCDMC on October 15, a week after he was stabbed. Sacramento Police detectives {{were assigned to the}} case shortly after the initial stabbing. Along with video obtained of the assault; eyewitness statements; and tips from the public, detectives determined the identity of the assailant, and an arrest warrant was issued for Tran. On November 4th, 2015, Tran was arrested without incident, after detectives, uniformed officers, and deputies from the Sacramento Police Department, Elk Grove Police Department, and Sacramento County Sheriff's Department conducted a traffic stop near his home in Elk Grove, California. Law enforcement officials involved in the case said that it did not appear Tran or anyone in his group knew of Stone's publicity. Officials also stated that the crime {{did not appear to be}} a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>strike</b> by a terrorist organization (either directly or indirectly) against Stone for his part in foiling a terror attack. Law enforcement officials stated that Tran has previous felony convictions, and that Tran was most likely intoxicated at the time of the assault.|$|E
5|$|During the Vietnam War, Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge communists {{had formed}} an {{alliance}} to fight U.S.-backed regimes {{in their respective}} countries. Despite their open display of cooperation with the Vietnamese, the Khmer Rouge leadership feared that the Vietnamese communists were scheming to form an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the dominant force in the region. In order to pre-empt {{an attempt by the}} Vietnamese to dominate them, the Khmer Rouge leadership began purging Vietnamese-trained personnel within their own ranks as the Lon Nol regime capitulated in 1975. Then, in May 1975, the newly formed Democratic Kampuchea, dominated by the Khmer Rouge, began attacking Vietnam, beginning with an attack on the Vietnamese island of Phú Quốc. In spite of the fighting, the leaders of reunified Vietnam and Kampuchea made several public diplomatic exchanges throughout 1976 to highlight the supposedly strong relations between them. However, behind the scenes, Kampuchean leaders continued to fear what they perceived as Vietnamese expansionism. As such, on 30 April 1977, they launched another major military attack on Vietnam. Shocked by the Kampuchean assault, Vietnam launched a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>strike</b> at the end of 1977 in an attempt to force the Kampuchean government to negotiate. In January 1978, the Vietnamese military withdrew because their political objectives had not been achieved—the Khmer Rouge remained unwilling to seriously negotiate.|$|E

25|$|The ceasefire {{ending the}} war came into effect at noon 22 February 1973. U.S. air power was {{grounded}} at that time. Fifteen minutes into the truce, a Communist offensive began to retake Paksong from the Royalists. On 23 February 1972, nine B-52s dropped a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>strike</b> on the Communists.

25|$|In August 1975, Vietnam {{returned}} {{island of}} Koh Wai to Kampuchea and both governments started making peaceful noises, {{but behind the}} scenes tensions were mounting. On 30 April 1977, Kampuchea started attacking Vietnamese villages. In September, six divisions crossed the border, advancing 10 kilometers (6.2mi) into Tay Ninh Province. Angered by {{the scale of the}} attacks, the Vietnam People’s Army assembled eight divisions to launch a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>strike</b> against Kampuchea.|$|E

In 1964, McDonald was the skipper of Attack Squadron VA-56 flying A-4 Skyhawks aboard the USS Ticonderoga. On August 5, 1964, he served as a flight leader for Operation Pierce Arrow, the first <b>retaliatory</b> <b>strike</b> against North Vietnam following the Gulf of Tonkin incident. McDonald led his Skyhawk strike force against oil tanks at Vinh, destroying 90% of the facility.|$|E
25|$|The cricket {{broadcasts}} {{take precedence}} over on-the-hour news bulletins, but not the Shipping Forecast, carried since its move to long wave in 1978 because that can be received clearly at sea. The station is the UK's national broadcaster in times of national emergency such as war, due to the wide coverage of the Droitwich signal: if all other radio stations were forced to close, it would carry on broadcasting. It has been claimed that the commanders of nuclear-armed submarines believing that Britain had suffered nuclear attack were required to check if they could still receive Radio 4 on 198 long wave, and if they could not they would open sealed orders that might authorise a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|E
25|$|North Korea {{possesses}} {{a vast array}} of long range artillery in shelters just north of the Korean Demilitarized Zone. It has been a long standing cause for concern that a preemptive strike or <b>retaliatory</b> <b>strike</b> on Seoul using this arsenal of artillery north of the Demilitarized Zone would lead to a massive loss of life in Seoul. Estimates on how many people would die in an attack on Seoul vary. When the Clinton administration mobilized forces over the reactor at Yongbyon in 1994, planners concluded that retaliation by North Korea against Seoul could kill 40,000 people. Other estimates projects hundreds of thousands or possibly millions of fatalities if North Korea uses chemical munitions.|$|E

25|$|In {{a vicious}} spiral of sectarian violence, civilians were an easy target. On 18 January 1976 an {{estimated}} 1,000–1,500 {{people were killed}} by Maronite forces in the Karantina Massacre, followed two days later by a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>strike</b> on Damour by Palestinian militias. These two massacres prompted a mass exodus of Muslims and Christians, as people fearing retribution fled to areas {{under the control of}} their own sect. The ethnic and religious layout of the residential areas of the capital encouraged this process, and East and West Beirut were increasingly transformed into what was in effect Christian and Muslim Beirut. Also, the number of Maronite leftists who had allied with the LNM, and Muslim conservatives with the government, dropped sharply, as the war revealed itself as an utterly sectarian conflict. Another effect of the massacres was to bring in Yassir Arafat's well-armed Fatah and thereby the Palestine Liberation Organisation {{on the side of the}} LNM, as Palestinian sentiment was by now completely hostile to the Maronite forces.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. has 18 Ohio-class submarines, {{of which}} 14 are Trident II SSBNs (Ship, Submersible, Ballistic, Nuclear), each capable of {{carrying}} 24 SLBMs. The first four which were all equipped with the older Trident I missiles have been converted to SSGN's each {{capable of carrying}} 154 Tomahawk guided missiles and have been further equipped to support Special Operations (SEALS). If the maximum of 154 Tomahawk missiles were loaded, one Ohio-class SSGN would carry an entire Battle Group's equivalent of cruise missiles. Ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs or boomers in American slang) carry submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) with nuclear warheads for attacking strategic targets such as cities or missile silos anywhere in the world. They are currently universally nuclear-powered to provide the greatest stealth and endurance. They played {{an important part in}} Cold War mutual deterrence, as both the United States and the Soviet Union had the credible ability to conduct a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>strike</b> against the other nation {{in the event of a}} first strike. This comprised an important part of the strategy of Mutual Assured Destruction.|$|E

500|$|Both sides ignored each other's proposals, and the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army {{continued}} sending soldiers {{across the}} border to attack Vietnamese towns and villages. In September 1977, Kampuchean artillery struck several Vietnamese villages along the border, and six villages in Đồng Tháp Province were overrun by Kampuchean infantry. Shortly afterwards, six divisions of the Kampuchea Revolutionary Army advanced about [...] into Tay Ninh Province, where they killed more than 1,000 Vietnamese civilians. Angered by the scale of Kampuchean assaults, the Vietnam People’s Army (VPA) assembled eight divisions, estimated at around 60,000 soldiers, to launch a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>strike</b> against Kampuchea. On 16 December 1977, the VPA divisions, with support from elements of the Vietnam People's Air Force, crossed the border along several axes with the objective of forcing the Kampuchean Government to negotiate.|$|E
500|$|Because ZAPU and ZIPRA {{were based}} in Zambia, many Rhodesians clamoured {{for a massive}} <b>retaliatory</b> <b>strike</b> against {{terrorist}} targets in that country, but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around Chimoio in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during Operation Dingo, destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the insurgents had since built a complex called [...] "New Chimoio", slightly to the east; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals. In a combined airborne-ground assault called Operation Snoopy, the Rhodesian Air Force, Rhodesian Light Infantry and Special Air Service wiped out much of New Chimoio on 20 September 1978. Mozambique sent armour to ZANLA's aid {{in the form of}} nine Soviet-made T-54 tanks and four Russian BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers, but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces. According to Rhodesian figures, there were [...] "several hundred" [...] guerrillas killed, while the security forces lost only two soldiers, one of whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike.|$|E
500|$|In his {{dealings}} with Edward III, Robert blamed his border magnates for the escalating attacks on the English zones, but regardless of this the Scots retained the recaptured lands, which were often portioned out among minor lords, so securing their interest in preventing English re-possession. [...] Despite Robert's further condemnations of his border lords, all the signs were that Robert backed the growing successful Scottish militancy following Edward III's death in 1377. [...] In a charter dated 25 July 1378 the king decreed that Coldingham Priory {{would no longer be}} a daughter house of the English Durham Priory but was to be attached to Dunfermline Abbey. [...] In early February the Scots—apparently unaware of the conclusion of an Anglo-French truce on 26 January 1384 that included the Scots in the cease-fire—conducted an all-out attack on the English zones winning back Lochmaben Castle and Teviotdale. [...] John of Gaunt led a reciprocal English attack that took him as far as Edinburgh, where he was bought off by the burgesses, but destroyed Haddington. [...] Carrick and James, Earl of Douglas (his father William had died in April), wanted a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>strike</b> for the Gaunt raid. [...] Robert may have concluded that as the French had reneged on a previous agreement to send assistance in 1383 and then having entered into a truce with England, that any military action would have been met with retaliation and exclusion from the forthcoming Boulogne peace talks. [...] On 2 June 1384, Robert resolved to send Walter Wardlaw, Bishop of Glasgow to the Anglo-French peace talks, yet Carrick ignored this and allowed raids into the north of England to take place. [...] Despite this, by 26 July, the Scots were part of the truce that would expire in October. [...] Robert called a Council in September, probably for working out how to proceed when the truce concluded, and to decide how the war was to proceed thereafter.|$|E
