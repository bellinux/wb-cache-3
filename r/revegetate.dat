To study the prediction of the potency of Collembola as bioindicator of <b>revegetated</b> tin-mined lands, population densities on <b>revegetated</b> tin-mined lands under Acacia mangium stands at 0, 3, 7, 9, 12, and 13 ¬years old were measured using pitfall trap method. It was recorded four Collembola species i. e. one belongs to family Isotomidae, two to family Entomobryidae, and one to family Sminthuridae. Population density of Collembola spp. in unrevegetated tin-mined land (0 -year old) was significantly different to those in <b>revegetated</b> tin-mined lands. Although population density was higher in the older <b>revegetated</b> tin-mined lands with the highest density recorded in 13 -year old site (4816 ind. m- 2), densities among <b>revegetated</b> tin-mined lands were not significantly different. The different population density appears related to organic material, litter either from <b>revegetated</b> plant, or from plant invaders during succession, and soil humidity. This study confirms the prediction of the potency of Collembola population density as bioindicator of <b>revegetated</b> tin-mined lands under Acacia mangium stands...|$|R
40|$|Willow removal {{followed}} by riparian revegetation {{is a widespread}} river restoration practice in Australia, but the ecological response to this has rarely been evaluated. We sampled river macroinvertebrates from six sites each of three riparian vegetation types: <b>revegetated</b> (treatment), willow-dominated (control) and native forest (reference) in the Gellibrand River catchment during austral spring 2007 and autumn 2008, and measured temperature and light intensity. <b>Revegetated</b> sites varied in age from 1 to 8 years since restoration. Abundances of invertebrates were similar across vegetation types, but were higher during autumn. Macroinvertebrate assemblages at <b>revegetated</b> sites (regardless of age) and at willow-dominated sites showed little among-site variation compared with native forest sites,which showed high site-to-site variability. Water temperatures and light intensity were higher at <b>revegetated</b> sites where works had recently been completed and cooler in native forest sites and long-established <b>revegetated</b> sites. The reduced variability in macroinvertebrate communities among <b>revegetated</b> sites may result from their history as willow-dominated sites or from the disturbance created by willow removal. Either way, {{these results suggest that}} longer than 8 years is required before macroinvertebrate assemblages in restored stretches of stream show the variation that appears characteristic of natural sites...|$|R

40|$|Most {{revegetation}} {{conducted for}} biodiversity conservation aims to mimic reference ecosystems present predisturbance. However, revegetation can overshoot or undershoot targets, {{particularly in the}} early stages of a recovery process, resulting in conditions different from the reference model. Revegetation that has, as yet, failed to fully meet revegetation targets may, nonetheless, provide habitat for threatened species not present in reference ecosystems. To investigate this possibility, we surveyed Quokka (Setonix brachyurus), a threatened macropod, in a mining landscape in south-western Australia. We established four sites in each of riparian forest, which is the preferred habitat of quokkas but is not mined, mid-slope forest, which is the premining reference ecosystem but is not suitable habitat for quokkas, and <b>revegetated</b> forest on mine pits 16 – 21 years postmining. We recorded quokkas in all riparian forest sites and two <b>revegetated</b> forest sites but not in any mid-slope forest sites. Occupied <b>revegetated</b> sites had greater cover between 0 and 2 m and were spatially closer to riparian forest than unoccupied <b>revegetated</b> sites, suggesting predation pressure was likely influencing which mine pits were occupied. Our study demonstrated postmining revegetation can provide new habitat for a threatened species and suggested that <b>revegetating</b> a small proportion of sites to provide new habitat for threatened species could be considered as a management option in some scenarios. This could improve landscape connectivity and increase both the area of available habitat and between-site heterogeneity, which could all potentially increase the ability of revegetation to conserve biodiversity...|$|R

40|$|Context: The {{conversion}} of tropical rainforest to grazing pasture {{results in a}} drastic change in small-mammal community composition. Restoring the landscape through ecological revegetation is thus an increasingly important management technique to conserve rainforest mammals. Aims: This study aimed to determine the habitat ages at which species of small mammals recolonised <b>revegetated</b> habitats on the southern Atherton Tablelands, north-eastern Queensland, Australia. We focussed on changes in rainforest mammal abundance and diversity with increasing habitat age. Methods: Small-mammal trapping and mark–recapture techniques investigated mammal diversity, abundance and community composition within remnant rainforest, three age classes of ecological revegetation and abandoned grazing pasture. Key results: Small-mammal community composition differed between remnant rainforest and abandoned grazing pasture. The pasture and 3 -year old <b>revegetated</b> sites were similar in composition, both lacking rainforest small mammals. Six- and 7 -year old revegetation plantings provided suboptimal habitat for both rainforest and grassland mammals, whereas 16 - and 22 -year old <b>revegetated</b> habitats were dominated by rainforest species, with some individuals being frequently recaptured. Conclusions: As <b>revegetated</b> habitats aged, the small-mammal community composition transitioned from a grassland-like composition to a community dominated by rainforest species. Implications: Although rainforest small mammals were very occasionally captured within the 6 - and 7 -year old habitats, <b>revegetated</b> plantings were not dominated by rainforest species until the habitat was 16 years old. This {{highlights the importance of}} commencing revegetation as early as possible to minimise future population declines and maximise the conservation of rainforest mammals...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} and sustainability of <b>revegetated</b> ecosystems {{is a central}} topic in ecological research. In this study, long-term monitoring and focused research on vegetation, soil and soil moisture from 2006 to 2012 were used to develop a model for evaluating indices of ecosystem stability using the analytical hierarchy process method. The results demonstrated that rainfall (R), vegetation coverage (C), and surface soil moisture (S) were the three most influential factors among the 14 indicators considered in a <b>revegetated</b> desert area in the Tengger Desert, China. A stability index (SI) was defined as SI = VAR (R) × VAR (C) /VAR (S), and a comparative {{study was conducted to}} examine the stability index of the natural vegetation community. The SI was divided into three regimes: SI < 0. 006 was stable, 0. 006 ≤ SI < 0. 015 was semi-stable, and 0. 015 ≤ SI was unstable. The stable, semi-stable and unstable periods of <b>revegetated</b> ecosystems in our simulations were 191, 17 and 11 years, respectively, within the total modeling period of 219 years.

40|$|Abstract: Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{indigenous}} beetle diversity reflects indigenous plant diversity in modified and remnant habitats. This study examines the indigenous: introduced relationship at a locality where degraded pasture has been progressively <b>revegetated.</b> Pitfall traps were used to collect beetles from three <b>revegetated</b> sites of different ages (5, 17 and 100 years) and in a coastal Muehlenbeckia habitat on Matiu-Somes Island (25 ha), Wellington Harbour, New Zealand. A total of 78 morphospecies were found over 12 months. The indigenous: introduced status of 74 species were determined; 67 were classified as ‘indigenous’, and 7 as ‘introduced’. A positive trend was found between the proportion of ground-dwelling indigenous beetle species collected and the proportion of indigenous plant species present at a study site. As the <b>revegetated</b> site matured, the proportion of indigenous beetle species increased. We collected 20 (83 %), 37 (88 %) and 48 (92 %) indigenous beetle species from the 5 -year scrubland, 17 -year shrubland and 100 -year forest, respectively. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

40|$|<b>Revegetating</b> burned {{areas is}} a {{formidable}} challenge facing resource managers in southwestern United States arid lands. Natural revegetation of desert burns by native species may be slow, or dominated by exotic annual grasses that perpetuate a frequent-fire regime. Resource managers may have several reasons for actively <b>revegetating</b> burns with native species, such as for providing competition with exotic species, minimizing soil erosion and dust pollution, and improving aesthetics. The use of native species in revegetation has been limited {{by a lack of}} available seed and by findings that native desert species are difficult to establish (e. g., Bainbridge and Virginia 1990, Banjerjee et al. 2006). Seeding may be one of only a few feasible options for reintroducing propagules to large desert burns covering thousands of hectares.

40|$|Land {{alteration}} for {{intensive agriculture}} {{has been a}} major cause of species decline and extinction globally. In marginal grazing regions of southern Australia, native perennial shrubs are increasingly being planted to supplement pasture feeding of stock. Such revegetation has the benefits of reducing erosion and salinity, and importantly, the potential provision of habitat for native fauna. Weexplored the use of <b>revegetated</b> native saltbush by the sleepy lizard (Tiliqua rugosa) an endemic Australian species common in the region. We repeatedly sampled <b>revegetated</b> saltbush throughout 2010 and 2011 for adults (n = 55) and juveniles (n = 26). Using genotypes from eight microsatellite loci, parents were assigned to half of all juveniles with high statistical confidence. Parents were sampled in the same patch of <b>revegetated</b> saltbush as their offspring, thus supporting the observation that juvenile sleepy lizards remain within the home range of their parents before dispersal. Most importantly, our findings indicate that <b>revegetated</b> saltbush provides important habitat for T. rugosa at significant life stages – before and during breeding for adults, and before dispersal for juveniles. We conclude that revegetation using simple, monoculture plantations provides beneficial habitat for T. rugosa and may also be beneficial habitat for other native species in human-altered agricultural landscapes.
