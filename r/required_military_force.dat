He reached the Emba River on 30 June and sent a smaller group forward to establish the next depot. The Ak Bulak River 100 miles south was chosen and a fort was built there in August. A large amount of hay was mown and reeds and willows were collected for fuel. For 40 kilometers north of Ak Bulak there were salt marshes with no adequate water or grass. By September a fort had been built on the Emba and hay mown. Fort Emba had a garrison of 634 men and Ak Bulak 399. The forts were unhealthy and by December 93 men had died. On the first of November a caravan of 1128 camels left Orenburg and reached the Emba 24 days later.|$|E

40|$|A {{bilateral}} military co-operation between Norway and Sweden {{has essentially}} required handling security challenges and rising costs. In addition, during recent {{years it has}} been revealed that cooperation with other nations is a prerequisite to obtain operational influence in multinational operations. These operations have <b>required</b> <b>military</b> <b>forces</b> {{with a high level}} of interoperability, to get the necessary fighting power. The aim of this study is to describe each country’s understanding of the use of <b>military</b> <b>forces,</b> and then compare them. It is also to present an unbiased assessment of what kind of implications co-operation between Norway and Sweden may have on military interoperability. To achieve this intention, I have chosen to focus on contemporary military strategic and operational doctrines in Norway and Sweden by addressing the following questions: - What is the Norwegian understanding of the use of <b>military</b> <b>forces?</b> - What is the Swedish understanding of the use of <b>military</b> <b>forces?</b> - What kind of differences and similarities exist between the Norwegian and Swedish understanding of the use of <b>military</b> <b>forces?</b> The analysis indicated both similarities and differences between the Norwegian and Swedish understanding. I have focused on the differences. As basic tools in this study I have used NATO`s classification of interoperability and British reflections on what shapes an effective fighting power. The study has discovered that the two countries` understanding of the use of <b>military</b> <b>forces</b> does not form an acceptable basis for their <b>military</b> <b>forces</b> to be interoperable. Through different use of definitions and theories, implications are revealed as to the development and use of <b>military</b> <b>forces,</b> e. g. lack of common doctrines. These implications will reduce the general understanding which is necessary in a military co-operation. In its turn this may reduce the core interoperability. The study shows that if military co-operation is to be useful, it is important to have a common understanding of the doctrines that constitute the basis for military co-operation...|$|R

40|$|The Sinai Peninsula’s {{security}} {{environment has}} altered significantly since President Mubarak’s overthrow in January 2011. Though Sinai {{has a history}} of militant Islamism, prior to 2011 violence was uncommon and limited in scope. Today, conflict is widespread and described by commentators as an insurgency. Violence has increased in frequency and is qualitatively different. Violence has also spilt beyond Sinai, affecting not just Egypt, but Israel and the wider region. This thesis maps how the Arab Spring has affected Sinai’s security environment. This is important as continued security deterioration demonstrates that Egypt’s actions there have failed. To explain why, this thesis provides a framework for understanding the security environment’s principal actors: Egypt, Israel, Gaza, militant Islamists and the Bedouin. Mapping Sinai’s security environment explains the nature of post-Mubarak changes and how these actors influenced these changes. The thesis demonstrates that regardless of the government in Cairo, Egypt’s military has controlled Sinai’s security and has viewed it through a solely security-based lens. To map the causes of these changes this thesis considers three themes. First, it demonstrates how Mubarak-era marginalisation of Sinai’s Bedouin politically, economically and socially has continued following the Arab Spring. Such marginalisation distances the Bedouin from the Egyptian state, and creates an environment susceptible to militant Islamism. Second, the thesis shows that Egyptian-Israeli security cooperation in Sinai has reached its zenith post-Arab Spring, with Israel allowing Egyptian re-militarisation of Sinai to combat militant Islamists. This thesis also argues that any approach that ignores the economic needs of the Bedouin and Gaza’s population will fail, with Bedouin’s reliance on the Egypt-Gaza tunnel trade distancing them economically from the Egyptian authorities. Last, whilst explaining the varied backgrounds of Sinai’s militant Islamists, this thesis demonstrates that the iii post-Morsi intensification of violence results from a coalescence of goals between militants and the Bedouin. Egypt’s current security-centric ‘separate, silence and neutralise’ strategy will not succeed. Whilst <b>requiring</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> tailored for counter-insurgency, Egypt’s strategy must include Bedouin economic development that integrates rather than isolates Gaza. Commencing at the governorate level, this must be combined with Bedouin political and social integration within the Egyptian state...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedCurrently, US <b>military</b> <b>forces</b> deploy and employ {{under the auspices}} of separate systems. Deployment occurs via the Joint Chiefs of Staff managed process called Joint Operational Planning and Employment System (JOPES). Employment of forces occurs under the direction of a combatant theater commander. In the case of special operations forces, the employment process is managed by a Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) commander and is known as Time Sensitive Planning. Special operations forces are able to execute jointly planned and rehearsed special operations missions within 96 hours of receiving a warning order. The JOPES deployment system may take days to complete the coordination <b>required</b> to deploy <b>military</b> <b>forces</b> overseas. However, control of those <b>military</b> <b>forces,</b> and therefore mission preparation, does not currently pass to the theater commanders until the forces arrive in theater. Depending on the method of transportation, this deployment window may take as long as a week. Although in some cases, deployments can be accomplished in a matter of days. This is {{the exception rather than the}} rule, though. The net effect is that the timeliness of military responses to crises is limited not only by the distance to the frontline, but also by the speed of the current JOPES and mission planning processes. This is true for special operations forces as well as conventional <b>military</b> <b>forces.</b> This thesis will offer a new operational concept for the deployment, employment, and command and control of specialized air power.

25|$|States with {{potentially}} hostile neighbors typically adopt defensive measures to delay or forestall an invasion. In addition to utilizing geographical barriers such as rivers, marshes, or rugged terrain, these measures have historically included fortifications. Such a defense can be intended to actively prevent invading forces {{from entering the}} country {{by means of an}} extended and well-defended barrier; the Great Wall of China, Hadrian's Wall, and the Danewerk are famous examples. Such barriers have also included trench lines and, in more modern times, minefields, cameras, and motion-sensitive sensors. However, these barriers can <b>require</b> a large <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to provide the defense, as well as maintain the equipment and positions, which can impose a great economic burden on the country.

40|$|The {{theme for}} this conference is "Civil-Military Relations and Social Issues in the Military. " A more germane topic is {{difficult}} to imagine in times of extreme stress on our fighting forces. Seemingly endless deployments coupled with continuous wars and worldwide tensions require support from the community at large and demand the most effective leadership our society can produce.

Wellgrounded and time-honored philosophical arguments suggest any attempt to successfully develop either of the two prongs of the theme of this conference is problematic at best. First, civil-military relations, as they exist in the United States today, attenuate the effectiveness of our forces and, second, existing social dysfunction within the services is a seed that can lead to eventual internal disintegration of the forces.
