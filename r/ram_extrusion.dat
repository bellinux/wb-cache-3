A laboratory <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion</b> rig {{was designed and}} manufactured, where dies with di fferent angles and exit radii were employed. Rate dependent behaviour was observed from tests conducted at different extrus ion speeds, and higher extrusion pressure was reported for dies with decreasing exit radius. A finite element simulation o f extrusion was performed using the adaptive meshing technique in Abaqus. Simulations using a frictionless contact b etween the billet and die wall showed that the model underestimates the response at high entry angles. On the other hand, when the coefficient of friction value was set to 0. 09 as measured from friction experiments, the dough response was over estimated, i. e. the model extrusion pressure was {{much higher than the}} experimentally measured values. When a critical shear stress limit, max W, was used, the accuracy of the model predictions improved. The results showed that higher die angles require higher max W values for the model and the experiments to agree...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{several studies}} with focus on {{developing}} state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies {{have been conducted}} to produce light vehicles by employing parts made of light materials such as aluminum and magnesium. Of such materials, magnesium {{has been found to}} pose numerous issues, because it cannot be deformed (plastic deformation) easily at low temperatures. Furthermore, oxidation on the surface of manganese occurs at high temperatures. This study analyzes the extrusion process for manufacturing magnesium bumper back beams used in vehicles, using finite element (FE) analysis. The properties of magnesium were determined through a compression test performed at high temperatures. And the temperature at which oxidation occurs at its surface was evaluated via an extrusion test. FE analysis was used to evaluate the extrusion load and temperature during the extrusion process, according to changes in initial material temperature and <b>ram</b> speed. <b>Extrusion</b> limit diagram of the extrusion process was derived {{based on the results of}} the FE analysis.

30|$|In {{both the}} {{cemented}} and uncemented components the polyethylene was machined using <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion</b> and sterilized with ethylene oxide (EtO). There {{are indications that}} PE components produced using molding provide for less wear compared with extruded components [20], but a main factor responsible for wear of UHMWPE in hip replacements is oxidative degradation, which degrades its mechanical properties [21]. Oxidation is strictly correlated with sterilization using high-energy radiation in air (γ radiation or an electron beam with dose of 25 – 40  kGy). UHMWPE components sterilized with ethylene oxide (EtO) do not oxidize. Our results, therefore, should be restricted to these methods of production and sterilization of PE.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{rheological}} properties of an extrudable cement-based paste are investigated {{by means of}} an original <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion</b> apparatus (capillary rheometer). The experimental results indicate that a careful measurement of the die pressure is necessary to obtain a realistic viscosity vs shear rate curve, as required in extrusion technology. In particular, it is shown that the optimal test configuration is when the pressure measurement is made directly inside the rheometer die. By applying this rheological methodology in steady-state conditions, it has been observed that the extrudable cement-based material here evaluated obeys to a simple power–law equation, in the range of shear rates investigated, which are suitable for an industrial extrusion proces...|$|E

40|$|Extrusion honing is a {{technique}} used for the finish machining of engineering components. The process {{may be used to}} deburr, radius or polish depending on the specific application. Extrusion honing utilises a polyborosiloxane polymer, which is mixed with fine abrasive particles and forced through or around components using an extrusion honing machine to achieve the machining action. It is evident that the machining process is very dependent upon the physical and mechanical characteristics of the polyborosiloxane. However, the process to date has largely been developed empirically, and further developments will require a greater understanding {{of the relationship between the}} characteristics of the polymer and the machining action. The rheology of the C- 11 polyborosiloxane has been investigated using a concentric cylinder, a slit-die and a capillary rheometer. The shear history of the polyborosiloxane prior to testing with the capillary rheometer was found to significantly affect the results produced. At shear strain rates up to 100 s- 1 and a temperature of 30 °C the rheology of the polyborosiloxane has been approximated to a power law equation (K. = 989 KPas; n= 0. 935). At shear strain rates greater than 100 s- 1 the pseudoplasticity of the polyborosiloxane increases significantly. Using this power law equation the velocity, shear strain rate and the shear stress within the polyborosiloxane in an extrusion die has been modelled mathematically. In some cases the extrusion barrel pressure and the mass flow rate through the extrusion die have both been shown to vary considerably during the constant <b>ram</b> velocity <b>extrusion</b> of polyborosiloxane in the capillary rheometer. It is tentatively proposed that such variations in the extrusion barrel pressure during capillary flow are a result of periodic slipping and sticking of the polyborosiloxane to the extrusion die wall. This mechanism is thought to be considerably influenced by the polyborosiloxane temperature, the <b>extrusion</b> <b>ram</b> velocity and the flow passage geometry. It is proposed that the measured variations in the mass flow rate of the polyborosiloxane through the extrusion dies are a result of pressure induced density variations within the extrusion barrel. This mechanism has been mathematically modelled. Temperature profiles within the C- 11 polyborosiloxane have been measured on an extrusion honing machine and the results suggest significant heat generation towards the periphery of the restriction. These results have been used to model mathematically the heat generation and transfer within the polyborosiloxane during operation of the extrusion honing machine. It is proposed that heat generation during extrusion honing is by friction at the medium/workpiece interface and internal shear within the medium. Both of these mechanisms would cause the greatest heat generation towards the periphery of an orifice restriction...|$|R
40|$|The {{maximum speed}} at which {{magnesium}} can be extruded is considerably slower than that of many common aluminium extrusion alloys. This affects both the economies of production and the final mechanical behaviour. The present work quantifies the limiting extrusion speeds and ratios of magnesium alloy AZ 31 {{as a function of}} billet temperature. This is done by combining hot compression test results, FE simulations and extrusion trials. Hot working stress–strain curves displayed a distinct dynamic recrystallisation peak. These data were used as a “look-up” table for the FE simulations in which the cracking limit was assumed to occur when the surface temperature reaches the incipient melting point. The maximum extrusion ratio predicted using FE analysis dropped from 90 to 40 when the <b>extrusion</b> <b>ram</b> speed was raised from 5 to 50 mm/s.

40|$|Extrusion {{is a low}} cost, {{versatile}} process {{widely used}} in industry {{for the production of}} a broad range of products of various shapes, including foodstuffs, pharmaceutical pellets and catalysts. The primary tool used to study the extrusion process in this work is Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). An extruder system made from PEEK and aluminium, suitable for use in strong magnetic fields, has been designed and commissioned. It has been used to acquire fully-quantitative spatially resolved real time NMR velocity measurements of two soft-solid materials representative of those commonly extruded in industry; a mixture of 5 cSt polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) added to a commercial soap (Dove TM), and a stiff biscuit dough. Flow patterns were found to be material dependent, with the soap and PDMS mix exhibiting a much flatter velocity profile than that of the biscuit dough. These spatially resolved velocity profiles are reliable and extensive, providing data suitable for evaluating theoretical models. Comparison of the experimentally determined velocity profiles with velocity profiles predicted from geometric and CFD models highlighted the limitations of these existing models, none of which proved to be entirely satisfactory. Self-diffusion measurements were used to investigate extrusion induced changes in the distribution of PDMS within soap and PDMS mixtures prepared by (i) warm-mixing and (ii) cold-mixing. Before extrusion the PDMS exists in domains of ~ 6 mm diameter. Extrusion of the warm-mixed sample leads to a ~ 17 % reduction in domain size, whereas extrusion of the cold-mixed sample causes elongation of the domains but not reduction in domain size. NMR has also been used to make in situ measurements of the extent of rejoining of two streams formed during <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion</b> through a die with a slit obstruction, and of the filling of a cylindrical mould following <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Short fiber {{reinforced}} {{cementitious composites}} (SFRCC) manufactured by the extrusion technique exhibit {{significant improvements in}} physical, mechanical and durable properties {{as compared with the}} fiber-reinforced cementitious composites made by traditional manufacturing techniques. The constitutive properties of the fresh SFRCC pastes for extrusion, as well as their interactions with the walls of extrusion equipments, are very important for enabling a successive and successful extrusion process. However, very few researches have been done in these areas. Till now, no proper experimental method is available for calibrating the constitutive behavior of the fresh SFRCC pastes for extrusion and no reliable constitutive model has been developed for such pastes. Moreover, numerical simulation, optimization and control of various forming processes of the fresh SFRCC pastes are still challenging. In the present study, first, various promising rheology and plasticity methods, including <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion,</b> orifice extrusion, capillary extrusion and upsetting, have been examined to investigate constitutive characteristics of the fresh SFRCC pastes for extrusion. In these experimental works, the traditional <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion</b> and orifice extrusion theories have been further developed and the capillary extrusion theory has been modified by taking the rate and the slip effects. The upsetting theory has been corrected to include the effects of boundary friction and strain rate. It has been found that the fresh SFRCC pastes show pseudo-plasticity and significant strain rate hardening behavior. Only by combing rheology and plasticity methods could it give a full description of the constitutive behavior of such pastes. Second, based on experimental and theoretical investigations, an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model has been proposed for the fresh SFRCC paste, which considers the von Mises yield criterion, the associated flow rule and nonlinear isotropic strain rate-hardening. The model is formulated by introducing a strain rate-dependent yield function. The associated material parameters in the proposed constitutive model could be identified from material tests without the help of numerical methods. These parameters have been determined for the fresh SFRCC paste for extrusion in this study. Third, the proposed elasto-viscoplasticy constitutive model has been formulated in a computational form and implemented into the explicit finite element code ANSYS/LS-DYNA for simulation purposes. Various forming processes of the fresh SFRCC pastes, including upsetting and <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion,</b> have been simulated using the ANSYS/LS-DYNA FE package, combined with the calibrated constitutive model and the established boundary conditions. The finite element simulation results, with respect to the forming load versus imposed deformation data, agree well with the pertinent experimental results, which verify the reliability of the proposed constitutive model, boundary interaction description and numerical procedures. The predicted material flow behavior, in light of displacement fields and distributions of some internal state variables, also gives promising interpretations of various forming processes. The present study provides an appropriate method to link materials science and engineering.

40|$|Aiming at {{assessing}} the stress distribution {{on the surface}} of a die mandrel during the extrusion of ceramic products, the flow of wet ground clay was simulated both in a <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion</b> device and by a FEM based model, considering the von Mises crite-rion for the flow stress, the associative flow rule and the rigid-viscoplastic constitu-tive equation. The friction between clay and die is approached by the Tresca bound-ary condition, which proves a more realistic approach than the Coulomb friction law for the contact conditions between a plastically deforming material and a rigid sur-face. The Tresca friction factor and the material parameters of the constitutive model are determined through comparison of experimental and theoretical results.

40|$|Equal channel angular {{extrusion}} (ECAE) is {{an efficient}} process to obtain enhanced microstructures via super-plastic deformation. In {{view of its}} optimisation, it is of prime importance to assess the relationships between processing conditions and material flow. More precisely, detailed knowledge of the plastic strain distribution in the extruded material {{in relation to the}} ECAE processing variables is required. The key parameters of the ECAE process are primarily die geometry, <b>ram</b> speed, <b>extrusion</b> temperature, use of back-pressure, number of extrusion sequences and processing route (e. g. rotation of the sample between successive passes). A numerical investigation was achieved to check out the influence of these parameters on the homogeneity of plastic strain distribution {{in the case of a}} conventional thermoplastic polymer. Material parameters of a phenomenological elastic viscoplastic model were deduced from compressive deformation tests at different temperatures and strain rates on high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Recommendations on tool geometry and processing conditions can then be provided, according to the numerical results. It was found that optimum ECAE die geometry is strongly material dependent. The application of a back-pressure significantly contributes to reduce the corner gap and consequently promotes the homogeneity of the plastic strain field. A slight sensitivity of plastic strain to ram speed and friction conditions was pointed out. The extrusion temperature strongly influences the magnitude of the plastic strain and has a slight effect on its homogeneity. The number of passes has a significant effect on the magnitude of the plastic strain but has a negligible influence beyond a certain temperature. The extruded material reaches a stationary strain state after few passes. The homogeneity of the plastic strain field is strongly affected by the processing route...|$|R

30|$|In the {{extrusion}} stable stage, {{the average}} grain sizes {{of the whole}} pipe are inhomogeneous. In the length direction, part A are the biggest and part B are the smallest, in the cross section, the middle part are smaller than the two sides. The main reason is the nonuniform deformations during the extrusion. In the length direction, the billet is under the constraint pressure and external friction from the die, the outer surface is under the additional shear deformation, therefore the materials flow out of the extrusion die in a nonuniform speed. Similarly, in the {{cross section of the}} pipe, the materials in outer and inner surface are under the shear deformation. Although the <b>extrusion</b> <b>ram</b> moves in a uniform velocity, but the flow speed of the materials during extrusion is nonuniform. In addition, another nonuniform factor is the temperature gradient of the billet during hot extrusion, and it is higher in the middle and lower in the two sides due to the heat exchanges with die and extrusion needle.|$|R

40|$|<b>Ram</b> <b>extrusion</b> {{of a solid}} {{granular}} soap was studied {{using three}} geometrically identical but differently-scaled extruders. The experimental design revealed deviation from the Benbow and Bridgwater (1993) extrusion model due to nonideal, scale-dependent effects. Typically these effects, linked to the shear rate in the extruder, are absorbed into the model's material pseudo-properties. The data were able to be represented using the Basterfield et al.

Flow visualisation in conjunction with fluid dynamics-based simulations showed, however, that the assumptions underlying the Basterfield et al. model are not appropriate for soap extrusion, despite the good agreement of the model with the experimental extrusion data. This highlights a need for care in interpretation of extrusion data, in that the limited information gathered about any given experiment, typically just the extrusion pressure, {{can lead to the}} generation of spurious parameters if the wrong model is applied.

40|$|Abstract We {{developed}} {{a model to}} predict the <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion</b> force of frictional plastic materials such as cement based pastes. The extrusion of cement based material has already been studied but interaction between shaping force and paste behaviour {{still has to be}} understood. Our model is based on the plastic frictional behaviour of cement based materials and integrates the physical mechanisms that govern material extrusion flow and extrusion force increase. When the process starts, a pressure gradient is created in the extruder due to wall friction of the paste which is submitted to plug flow. It induces a consolidation of the material. As a result, a large increase of extrusion force appears. A Coulomb law is used to model cement based materials which is considered as consolidating granular media. Such modelling is compared with experimental results. Tests were carried out on extrudible cement pastes. Modelling and experimental results are in good agreement.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an easy method of {{extrusion}} freeforming to fabricate microwave electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) crystals. EBG crystals are periodic dielectric structures that can block wave propagation and generate a bandgap. These crystals can be used in high capability antennae, electromagnetic wave semiconductors, microresonators, high-reflectivity mirrors and polarizing beam splitters. Design/methodology/approach – The effects of extrusion process parameters and paste characteristics were investigated. Finally, one-period and two-period woodpile EBG crystals with bandgaps in the frequency region of 90 - 110 ?GHz were fabricated and the bandgap was measured. Findings – The filament diameter is influenced by whether extrusion is carried out with or without a substrate and by the free fall-distance from the nozzle. The quality of lattice structures is dependent on paste flow and properties. A ceramic paste with 60 ?vol. ?% (the fraction of ceramic powder based on solvent-free polymer) was well suited to fabrication. The solvent content also influenced the fabrication. The experimental results show that under ~ 12 per cent solvent mass fraction in the paste and relatively high <b>extrusion</b> <b>ram</b> velocity (more than 0. 014 ?mm/s) at a pressure of 14 ?MPa, samples with high quality were fabricated.

The flow stresses decrease with increasing deformation temperature and {{the rate at which}} this occurs increases with percent reinforcement. Flow stress as a function of strain rate and temperature was suitably represented by the hyperbolic sine and Arrhenius equations for the alloy and metal matrix composites. Extrusion, modeling was performed for the four materials using the constitutive equations above and the finite element software DEFORM which is a registered trademark of Scientific Forming Technologies Corporation.

40|$|Initial work {{presented}} in this dissertation on extrusion supports the findings of others with regard to standard die extrusion. In addition, comparisons between <b>ram</b> and screw <b>extrusion</b> results were made and are briefly discussed. In relation to wide sheet extrusion, unusual flow instabilities {{in the form of}} central line splitting of the extrudates were observed for the first time, indicating that the chocolate was weak in tension. Solutions for eliminating for flow defects are also presented and mathematical modelling provided insight into the flow mechanism. Post extrusion mechanical characterisation of the extruded chocolate was carried out by means of bending and indentation tests and the effect of processing conditions on the flexibility and hardness of chocolate extrudate was examined. The results showed the presence of a two-stage, post extrusion rehardening process, which was consistent with earlier findings. In terms of stamping, the process itself and the effect of processing variables on the shape formability and surface gloss formation in the chocolate product were established for the first time. Optimal conditions that contributed to the formation of well-defined products with high gloss finish were identified.

Both devices provided differing measurements of the pressure sensitivity, and gave shear stress estimates in agreement with a Benbow and Bridgwater (1993) analysis of the extrusion behaviour, which cannot gauge pressure dependence. The influence of the wall material on the slip and extrusion behaviour was also investigated, using three geometrically identical extruders constructed from polycarbonate, stainless steel and tungsten carbide.

In particular, the formulations contained: stearic acid as a low melting binder, monohydrate lactose and polyethylene glycol 6000 as hydrophilic fillers. The influence of type and percentage of the components was studied considering different parameters such as the time required for 50 % of the drug release (t 50 %) and the drug diffusion coefficient in the delivery system. The choice of the different formulations to be tested is carried out employing an axial design with constraint domains. The limits of each component were fixed on the basis of preliminary trials. The analysis of the t 50 % values revealed that the release kinetics is mainly affected by stearic acid and theophylline content, whilst lactose effect is almost negligible.

40|$|Fletcher Aluminium is a New Zealand {{company that}} {{manufactures}} aluminium extrusions {{for the building}} market. Their extrusion process involves using a hydraulic ram to force heated raw supplied material, {{in the form of}} large diameter cylindrical logs, through a die land that is the desired product shape. The final quality of the extruded product is influenced by the <b>extrusion</b> temperature, <b>ram</b> pressure and <b>extrusion</b> speed. The speed of extrusion at Fletcher Aluminium is limited by the <b>extrusion</b> <b>ram</b> pressure because the extrusion machine is operating at the pressure limit of the compressor. Currently the company requires an increase in the extrusion speed, while maintaining quality requirements where these improvements are desired without upgrading the compressor. The press pressure is required to overcome friction and the flow stress of the billet, which is dependent on the precipitates and solutes conditions and their strengthening effects in the billet. However, the preheating temperature and extrusion speeds need to be sufficiently low enough to avoid hot tearing. This research starts to increase the ram speed by decreasing the Mg 2 Si content for precipitation strengthening. Heat treatment may be used to dissolve Mg 2 Si content by billet preheat to a temperature at or exceeds solvus temperature (TSolvus). However, a higher (than TSolvus) billet temperature may have two conflicting effects. First, a higher temperature in general reduces the flow stress thus lowering the required pressure. On the other hand, at temperature higher than Tsolvus, Mg 2 Si should completely dissolve, resulting in solid solution strengthening thus increasing the flow stress. The objective of the study is to quantify the strengthening contributions from solute atoms (Mg / Si) and precipitates (Mg 2 Si) on the as-received and heat treated test samples using room temperature mechanical testing and phase diagram analysis. The selected heat treatment conditions fully enclose the preheating temperature and time range currently used in Fletcher Aluminium production. Simulations of the extrusion were conducted by hot compression testing (Gleeble test), to measure the combination of strengthening effects during deformation at elevated temperatures. The room temperature tests have shown that hardness, yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) are minimised at approximately 405 °C. The minimum point is shown to be caused by the combination of strengthening and softening due to solid solution and precipitation strengthening. The higher values of hardness, YS and UTS at lower and higher preheating temperatures are mainly due to precipitation and solution strengthening respectively. The findings show that, the solution of Mg 2 Si gradually increases as the temperature increases at temperatures exceeding 405 °C. Hardness, YS and UTS were compared {{in order to determine the}} correlation between each mechanical property. A correlation exists, but it is not simple to translate between each mechanical property. The relationship between hardness and stress observed for 8 % permanent strain was also investigated; there was no improvement in correlation. The elevated temperature tests show that initial flow stress and peak flow stress reduces linearly with temperature increases, which means higher testing temperature results lower precipitation and solid solution strengthening effects. Additionally, the constants of the Gleeble – Holomon equation were numerically calculated and are similar to published values. The Gleeble – Holomon equation was combined with Felthams equation in order to provide a relationship between extrusion velocity and extrusion temperature...|$|R

The extrudates were evaluated according to surface characteristics (by visual inspection), force of extrusion and duration of steady-state (after recording the force applied to the ram and its displacement). Simultaneously, for each process of extrusion {{it was possible to}} assess the angles of convergence {{to the bottom of the}} chambers for both the external and internal chambers. These angles reflected the high complexity of the extrusion occurring on the external chamber in consequence of its annular geometry, in which the bisecting-line was not parallel to the axis of the extruder, by opposition to the converging angle in the internal chamber, where the bisecting-line was perfectly aligned to the axis of the extruder. Variations in the amount of water in the formulations and the speed of extrusion affected both the production and the quality of the extrudates and their ability to provide pellets. The rod extrudates were the easiest to produce and the relationships between the formulations, the processing conditions and the properties of the extrudates were immediately apparent. On the other hand, co-extrudates were more complex to characterise, although identical relationships between formulations, processing conditions and the properties of the co-extrudates were observed as for the rod extrudates. Different batches of extrudates (rod, tubular and co-extrudates) were spheronized to a maximum spheronization time of 10 min at 1000 rpm. The pellets were characterized with respect to size, size distribution, sphericity and density. Results have shown that for a larger diameter of the co-extrudates, the pellets produced were bigger (approximate to 3. 38 mm) than the pellets produced from rod extrudates (1. 22 mm). For longer times of spheronization, the aspect ratio and the density increased for both pellets produced from rod (0. 95 and 1. 46 g/cm(3)) and co-extrudates (0. 90 and 1. 47 g/cm(3)). The study has shown the potential of this new technology in providing a product with advantages over the traditional spheres produced by extrusion and spheronization. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The {{metal forming}} process is {{preferable}} for manufacturing {{the parts of}} moderate complexity and greatly diversified profiles for the larger volume of productions to reduce the tooling cost. Energy saving, less scrap generation and near net shape production with better mechanical properties along with high production rate have enhanced the specific forming process, extrusion, {{for the production of}} long straight metal products. The huge demand of aluminium alloy in the extrusion industry for fulfilling the market requirements in the sector of building and architecture, construction, automobile and transport system, electrical and electronics, aerospace, and heat exchangers tends to optimize the process for improved process efficiency as well as product quality. Prediction of the influence of process parameters is very difficult owing to the concealed material deformation during extrusion. Due to this reason, an illustrious finite element analysis tool (DEFORM TM) was adopted to investigate the process. The simulations were performed to ascertain extrusion load, effective stress, effective strain and temperature distribution for square to square extrusion process. To decipher the effect of die length, <b>ram</b> velocity and <b>extrusion</b> ratio in the process, simulations were carried out by varying the variables in a wide range with different types of dies. The process was also employed for the investigation of the round to square extrusion considering the same parameters along with punch shape for Al- 6063 alloy. Influence of die profile plays a predominant role in predicting the ultimate load requirements and flow characteristics. Considering the die profile an important component, the profile for round to square shape has been developed by following cosine, linear converging, elliptic, hyperbolic and 3 rd order polynomial laws. Considering the above die profiles the simulations were conducted with optimised process parameters to find out a suiatable die profile. The simulations were validated with high-temperature experimentations. To improve the product properties, aluminium metal matrix composites (AMMC) prepared by powder metallurgy (PM) route has been extruded. Four different reinforcing elements of 2 wt. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Co-extrusion {{processing}} is a powder-based forming {{method that}} uses the simultaneous <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion</b> {{of two or more}} materials to form multi-phase systems with functionally designed architectures. A functionally designed material has functional properties that are specifically tailored for an application by changing the macrostructure (100 ’s of microns) with little or no change in overall composition. Thus, co-extrusion can be used to improve the functional properties of composite materials, with or without a concurrent boost of its intrinsic properties. An example of a functionally designed material with a coaxially co-extruded architecture, known in the ceramic field as a “fibrous monolith”, has elongated cells of a major (70 - 90 vol. %) phase surrounded by cell boundaries of a minor (10 - 30 vol. %) phase. A variety of strong-phase/weaker-phase combinations have been demonstrated, including Si 3 N 4 /BN, SiC/graphite, SiC/BN. Several wear resistant-phase/ductile-phase combinations have also been studied, including Diamond(Co) /WC(Co) for use in the petroleum drilling industry. The presentation will cover co-extrusion processing as a technology, applications that are being considered or are in production for most of the latter materials combinations, and a discussion of the functional properties that can be achieved using co-extrusion as a means to create functionally designed materials...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, time-continuous {{constitutive}} equations for strain rate-dependent {{materials are}} presented first, among which {{those for the}} overstress and the consistency viscoplastic models are considered. By allowing the stress states to be outside the yield surface, the overstress viscoplastic model directly defines the flow rule for viscoplastic strain rate. In comparison, a rate-dependent yield surface is defined in the consistency viscoplastic model, so that the standard Kuhn-Tucker loading/unloading condition still remains true for rate-dependent plasticity. Based on the formulation of the consistency viscoplasticity, a computational elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model is proposed for the short fiber-reinforced fresh cementitious paste for extrusion purpose. The proposed constitutive model adopts the von-Mises yield criterion, the associated flow rule and nonlinear strain rate-hardening law. It is found that the predicted flow stresses of the extrudable fresh cementitious paste agree well with experimental results. The rate-form constitutive equations are then integrated into an incremental formulation, which is implemented into a numerical framework based on ANSYS/LS-DYNA finite element code. Then, a series of upsetting and <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion</b> processes are simulated. It is found that the predicted forming load-time data are in good agreement with experimental results, suggesting that the proposed constitutive model could describe the elasto-viscoplastic behavior of the short fiber-reinforced extrudable fresh cementitious paste...|$|E
40|$|Quality of {{skim coat}} was {{examined}} by using both {{qualitative and quantitative}} methodologies. The industrial problems of skim coats are of two major types; mixing related and application related. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to rank these problems according to their relative importance. Difficult to trim, poor workability and poor mixing were having the highest ranking based on the comments given by the manufacturers, retailers and users. The effect of thickener percentage in the skim coat {{was found to be}} significant for difficulties in mixing. Mixing was easy up to 0. 5 % of thickener and the flowability was found to be the best in the range of 0. 3 – 0. 6 % of thickener. Increase of thickener percentage has increased the tendency for forming agglomerates and lumps of paste during mixing. Good workability and optimum setting could be achieved with 0. 3 – 0. 5 % of thickener. Optimum performance for trimming could be achieved with 0. 3 – 0. 6 % of thickener. The above qualitative results were verified quantitatively with the physical testing; <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion,</b> set to touch drying time test, pencil hardness test and dust weight on trimming. According to both qualitative and quantitative analysis, the optimum amount of thickener in skim coat was found to be in the range of 0. 3 – 0. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the suitable strategies to enhance the normally poor corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of magnesium alloys {{is an important issue}} that must be solved in order that magneiusm-based materials have wider biomedical applications. The work described in the thesis consists of two processing part: 1) Mg-xCa alloy preparation; in which five different mixture of commercially pure Mg (99. 999 %) and granules of Mg- 40 %Ca were die-cast and 2) extruding one of the as-cast Mg-xCa alloy from the casting process with optimum properties resulted from tests accomplished, at ram speeds of 26, 52 and 65 rpm and temperatures 250 °c, 350 °c and 450 °c. Optical microscopy observations of as-cast products and compositional analysis accomplished by EDS and X-RD showed that Mg-xCa (x= 0. 7 %, 1 %, 1. 9 %, 2. 8 % and 3. 6 %) were composed of two phases, a(Mg) as the grain matrix and Mg 2 Ca on the grain boundaries. The hardness test results also showed that the Vickers hardness rates will increase by increasing the Ca content in the Mg-Ca alloys which was mainly due to the grain refinement and increment of Mg 2 Ca volume hindering the dislocations movements; According to the corrosion potential values, in-vitro corrosion rate and pH values, it was found out that binary Mg-Ca alloys with greater Ca contents corrodes faster than alloys containing less Ca; thus, increases the pH of the SBF solution and hydrogen evoluted from cathodic reaction more than others, that is predominantly due to grain refinement and increased Mg 2 Ca by adding more Ca. Finally by comparing the results acquired from tests and findings of Li et al. (2008) the Mg- 1 %Ca was selected as the the best compromise between mechanical properties, degradation behavior and biocompatibility of the implant. Since the higher <b>ram</b> speeds in <b>extrusion</b> develop finer grain structure (Y. Uematsu et al. 2006) it was expected that the corrosion rate decreased by grain refinement, but {{based on the results of}} electrochemical and immersion test conducted on as-extruded Mg- 1 %Ca products, the corrosion rate is lowest for the temperatures around 350 ºc and ram speeds of approximately 50 rpm. The hardness rates of the samples were enhanced at higher ram speeds and lower processing temperatures which is mainly because of grain refinement and possible phase precipitations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Polyethylene {{has been}} used as a bearing {{material}} for more than fi ft y years. It represents a golden standard in orthopaedics. Today the most important processes for manufacture of polyethylene are compression moulding and <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion.</b> As sterilization methods, irradiation with gamma rays in vacuum or inert gas and sterilization in plasma or ethylene oxide are used. Characteristics: Wear of polyethylene and consequent formation of wear particles are the key factor in the mechanism of aseptic loosening of total hip replacements. Pathophysiology of loosening is a complex process. Osteoclasts and their precursors have a crucial role in bone resorption. Th e diff erentiation of these multinucleated cells and their activation is regulated RANK/ RANKL/OPG regulatory axis. Clinical results: Long-term results of the use of bearings with a metal femoral head and a polyethylene acetabular cup are good although dependent on the size of the used femoral head and the quality of polyethylene. However, these results are inferior to those obtained with a ceramic femoral head and a polyethylene cup, as well as those obtained with cross-linked polyethylene and ceramicon- ceramic bearings. Conclusions: In-vitro simulation cannot fully predict the eff ect of various factors which in vivo aff ect the physical and chemical properties of polyethylene. Th e development of polethylene has thus not been completed yet. Currently, the research is targeted at highly cross-linked polyethylene and polyethylene enriched with alpha-tocopherol...|$|E
40|$|The {{lightweight}} and good strength of oriented thermoplastic tubes, produced through the <b>ram</b> <b>extrusion</b> process, renders {{this class of}} material advantageous from an automotive structural part forming perspective. An analytical model, capable of predicting the forming limits for these matt::rials at elevated temperatures, would avoid the need for difficult and time-consuming tube forming experiments. The uniaxial tensile stress-strain properties of the oriented polypropylene (OPP) tubes along the axial and hoop direction wene determined while methods were developed for obtaining the uniaxial compressive prop 1 erties of the tube. The uniaxial and biaxial testing of the OPP tubes enabled representation of the experimental plastic work contours for the material at a range of temperatures. The use of the pressure-modified Hill criterion, the concept of plastic work contours in stress space, and the stress strain data from uniaxial testing of the tube allowed accurate prediction of the plastic work contours for the OPP tubes {{as a function of}} temperature. The analytical prediction was able to capture the anisotropy, pressure dependency and anisotropic hardening exhibited by the material at elevated temperatures. In addition, the use of a localized necking criterion, which involved {{the point at which the}} maximum force along the hoop direction of the tube was reached, allowed the temperature dependent forming limits for the material to be predicted. The forming limits increased with temperature for all of the strain paths considered. In addition, at a given temperature, the forming limits decreased wit...|$|E
