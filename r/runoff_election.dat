5|$|In March 2016, Jones filed {{to run for}} Georgia House of Representatives, {{this time}} in District SH 091, an open seat vacated by Dee Dawkins Haigler {{to run for the}} Georgia State Senate. In the May 2016 Democratic primary election, Jones came within sixty votes of an {{outright}} victory, but was forced into a <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> with Rhonda Taylor. Jones won the July <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> and in November 2016, once again won election to the Georgia House, defeating Republican Carl Anuszczyk.|$|E
5|$|On September 1st, Reed {{resigned}} from the Georgia Senate to run for mayor. No candidate won {{a majority in the}} November 3 general election, and Donzella James defeated Torrey O. Johnson in the <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> on December 1 to replace Reed.|$|E

5|$|Mayoral {{elections}} were originally run under a two-round system. If no candidate received {{a simple majority}} of votes in the general election, the two candidates who received the most votes competed in a second <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> held several weeks later. In 2002, the election system for city officials was overhauled {{as a result of}} a citywide referendum. The new system, known as instant-runoff voting, allows voters to select and rank three candidates based on their preferences. If no one wins more than half of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and second-choice votes (and third-choice votes, if necessary) are counted until a candidate captures the majority. This eliminates the need to hold a separate <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> and saves money. This was first implemented in the 2004 Board of Supervisors election after two years of preparation. In 2007, the new system was implemented in the mayoral election for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The county prefects, {{city and}} {{municipal}} mayors are elected to four-year terms {{by a majority}} of votes cast within applicable local government units. If no candidate achieves a majority in the first round, a <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> is held. Members of county, city and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms, through proportional representation with the entire local government unit as a single constituency.|$|E
5|$|The general {{election}} {{was held on}} 27 April. Menem won the first round with 24.5 percent of the vote, followed by Kirchner with 22.2 percent. The conservative Ricardo López Murphy finished third, substantially behind the two main candidates. Since Menem was well short of the threshold required to win, a <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> was scheduled for 18 May. He had a negative public image, and polls showed Kirchner receiving 60 to 70 percent of the vote. To avoid a humiliating defeat, Menem {{pulled out of the}} runoff in a move criticized by the other candidates. The judiciary declined requests for a new election and refused to sanction a <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> between Kirchner and López Murphy, although López Murphy said he would not participate. The election was validated by the Congress, and Kirchner became president on 25 May 2003. Kirchner's 22.2 percent is the lowest vote percentage ever recorded for an Argentine president in a free election.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the election, the Louisiana House of Representatives {{consisted}} of 57 Republicans, 46 Democrats, 2 Independents, and one vacancy.

5|$|In 1991 Preckwinkle {{and four}} others {{challenged}} Evans for the 4th ward alderman's position. In {{the first round}} of voting on February 26, 1991, she won nearly one-third popular vote in the ward by winning 20 of 58 precincts (all in the Hyde Park-Kenwood community). Evans and Preckwinkle again advanced to a <b>runoff</b> <b>election,</b> as they had in 1983, but this time the majority of the eliminated candidates endorsed Preckwinkle. On April 2, 1991, Preckwinkle performed better {{in the northern part of}} the ward and was elected by a 109-vote margin, defeating the 17-year incumbent alderman Evans.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{constitution}} and legislation provides for regular {{elections for the}} office of the President of the Republic, parliamentary, county prefects, county assemblies, city and municipal mayors and city and municipal councils. The President of the Republic is elected to a five-year term by a direct vote of all citizens of Croatia. A majority vote is required to win. A <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> round is held in cases where no candidate secures the majority {{in the first round of}} voting. The presidential elections are regulated by the {{constitution and}} dedicated legislation; the latter defines technical details, appeals and similar issues.|$|E

40|$|We compare single round versus <b>runoff</b> <b>elections</b> under {{plurality}} rule, {{allowing for}} partly endogenous party formation. Under <b>runoff</b> <b>elections,</b> {{the number of}} political candidates is larger, but the influence of extremist voters on equilibrium policy, and hence policy volatility, is smaller because the bargaining power of the political extremes is reduced compared to single round elections. The predictions {{on the number of}} candidates and on policy volatility are confirmed by evidence from a regression discontinuity design in Italy, where cities above 15, 000 inhabitants elect the mayor with a runoff system, while those below hold single round elections...|$|R

5|$|The {{mayor is}} elected in citywide {{election}}. Elections follow a two-round system. The {{first round of}} the election is called the primary election. The top-two candidates from the primary election advance to a <b>runoff</b> <b>election,</b> called the general election. Write-in candidates are only allowed to contest the primary election and are not allowed in the general election. The mayor is elected to a four-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms. The mayor is officially non-partisan by state law, although most mayoral candidates identify a party preference.|$|E
5|$|From 1996 to 2001, Jew was District 4 then-supervisor Leland Yee's {{volunteer}} community liaison. Jew first ran for Yee's District 4 seat in 2002 when Yee {{ran for the}} California State Assembly. Despite Yee's endorsement, Jew finished third, {{missing the}} <b>runoff</b> <b>election.</b> In 2006, Jew again ran for same supervisor seat when Fiona Ma ran for the California Assembly. Jew led other candidates including his top challenger Ron Dudum {{in the first round}} with 26% first-place votes. He eventually won the closely fought election after securing a 52% majority. In December 2006, Mayor Gavin Newsom appointed Jew to serve out the remainder of Ma's term; he took office in January 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Capuano {{was elected}} to the Somerville Board of Aldermen {{representing}} Ward 5, once served in by his father. Capuano served one term, stepping down in 1979 to run for Mayor of Somerville. In the 1979 mayoral election he faced Eugene Brune, Paul Haley, and incumbent, Thomas August. He lost the nomination to Brune, who went on to defeat August. Capuano ran again in 1981 to challenge Brune, placing second in a three-person <b>runoff</b> <b>election.</b> Capuano promoted his opposition to the state ballot question Proposition 2½ and criticized Brune for expanding the mayoral staff in the face of tight city budgets, while Brune touted his prevention of service cuts after the proposition passed. Capuano lost in the general election with 40% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|In balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame {{following}} his retirement, Ruffing often received votes from approximately 50% {{of the voters}} in the Baseball Writers' Association of America, short of the 75% required for induction. Bob Feller wrote an article in The Saturday Evening Post in 1962, calling Ruffing, Satchel Paige, and Luke Appling the three most deserving players who {{had yet to be}} elected. The balloting of 1967 was Ruffing's final year of eligibility, as he had retired twenty years prior. Ruffing finished with 212 votes, tied with Joe Medwick for the highest vote count, but was seven votes short of the 219 required for induction. However, a <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> held the next month saw Ruffing into the Hall of Fame the next month.|$|E
5|$|In the July 15, 2008 Democratic primary election, Jones won a {{plurality}} of votes in the Democratic primary. However, Georgia law requires a majority; if no majority is reached by a candidate, the two top vote-getters must face {{one another in a}} runoff. On August 5, 2008 Jones lost the run-off election to Jim Martin by a margin of 20 points. Jones unexpectedly lost to Martin in his home base of Dekalb County. Jones had lost support within the black community before the <b>runoff</b> <b>election,</b> and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head to head match up against Martin. The black turnout in the run-off was also substantially lower than the initial primary election, further hurting Vernon Jones' chances in the runoff.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon {{knew the}} primary bill would be widely {{supported}} in the General Assembly, since both legislators and their constituents {{had grown to}} distrust party nominating conventions. Accordingly, he proposed a bill enacting a mandatory two-stage primary in which a <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> would be held between the top two candidates in the first round. Historian Lowell H. Harrison maintained that Laffoon expected his rival faction to nominate the aging Beckham to oppose Rhea, and that he hoped a two-stage primary would wear Beckham down. Journalist John Ed Pearce, however, contends that Beckham had already declined to become a candidate—citing his own ill health {{and that of his}} son—before the special session convened. Whatever the case, the legislature passed the bill that Laffoon proposed.|$|E

40|$|A crucial {{component}} of Runoff electoral systems is the threshold fraction of votes above which a candidate wins outright in the …rst round. I analyze {{the influence of}} this threshold on the voting equilibria in three-candidate <b>Runoff</b> <b>elections.</b> I demonstrate {{the existence of an}} Ortega Effect which may unduly favor dominated candidates and thus lead to the election of the Condorcet Loser in equilibrium. The reason is that, contrarily to commonly held beliefs, lowering the threshold for first-round victory may actually induce voters to express their preferences excessively. I also extend Duverger’s Law to <b>Runoff</b> <b>elections</b> with any threshold below, equal or above 50 %. Therefore, Runo ¤ elections are plagued with inferior equilibria that induce either too high or too low expression of preferences...|$|R
5|$|The county prefects {{and city}} and {{municipal}} mayors are elected to four-year terms by majority of votes cast within applicable local government units. A <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> is held if no candidate achieves {{a majority in}} the first round of voting. Members of county, city, and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms through proportional representation; the entire local government unit forms a single constituency. The number of council members is defined by the councils themselves based on applicable legislation. Electoral committees are then tasked with determining whether the national minorities are represented in the council as required by the constitution. If the minorities are not represented, further members, who belong to the minorities and who have not been elected through the proportional representation system, are selected from electoral candidate lists and added to the council.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} is elected {{on the basis}} of universal suffrage, through a secret ballot, for a five-year term. If no candidate in the elections secures more than 50% of the votes, a <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> is held in 14 days. The Constitution of Croatia sets a limit to a maximum of two terms in office and requires election dates to be determined within 30 to 60days before the expiry of the term of the incumbent president. Any citizen of Croatia of 18 or over may be a candidate in a presidential election, provided that the candidate is endorsed by 10,000 voters. The endorsements are required in form of a list containing name, address, personal identification number and voter signature. The presidential elections are regulated by an act of the parliament.|$|E
5|$|With the 1979 {{municipal}} elections occurring only {{months after the}} riot, prominent gay leaders feared a backlash at the polls. The elections continued without incident, and the gay community fared better than expected, wielding unprecedented influence. Although the virtually unknown gay Mayoral candidate David Scott {{finished third in the}} election, his showing was strong enough to force Mayor Feinstein into a <b>runoff</b> <b>election</b> against conservative City Supervisor Quentin Kopp. Feinstein's promises to appoint more gay people to public office, and her heavy campaigning in the Castro, ensured that she won enough support from the gay community to give her a full term as Mayor.|$|E
