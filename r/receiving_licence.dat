50|$|A {{television}} licence or broadcast <b>receiving</b> <b>licence</b> is {{an official}} record of payment required in many countries for the reception of television broadcasts, or the possession of a television set where some broadcasts are funded in full or {{in part by the}} licence fee paid.

A TV licence is therefore effectively a hypothecated tax for the purpose of funding public broadcasting, thus allowing public broadcasters to transmit television programmes without, or with only supplemental, funding from radio and television advertisements. However, in some cases the balance between public funding and advertisements is the opposite - the Polish TVP broadcaster receives more funds from advertisements than from its TV tax.|$|E
