30|$|From {{the point}} of view of the evolution, most part of the {{landslides}} classified as fall (63  %) and complex (50  %) resulted in formed-stable dams and just a fraction of these landslides (10  % for falls and 15  % for complex landslides) did not produce a complete obstruction. Instead, a small part of the landslides classified as flows formed a dam stable until now (only 14  %), while the majority of formed dams were stable only for a short period of time (44  %) or not formed at all (41  %). Slides, translational or rotational, have a completely different evolutionary behavior. The <b>rotational</b> <b>slide</b> are almost equally distributed in not formed, formed-unstable and formed-stable, and most part of the translational movements seem not to be able to build a complete damming (56  %). When the damming is complete, though, it is often stable (37  %). The higher stability of fall and complex landslides compared to flows is probably due (Canuti et al., 1998) to the usual bigger volume and the internal geotechnical properties of the fall and complex landslides materials.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to verify and compare the predictive power of different diagnostic areas in assessing landslide susceptibility with a multivariate approach. Scarps, landslide areas (the union between scarp and accumulation zones) and areas uphill from crowns, for <b>rotational</b> <b>slides,</b> source or scarp areas and landslide areas, for flows, have been tested. A multivariate approach was applied to assess the landslide susceptibility on the basis of three selected conditioning factors (lithology, slope angle, and topographic wetness index), which were combined in a Unique Condition Unit (UCU) layer. By intersecting the UCU layer with the vector layer of the diagnostic areas, landslide susceptibility models were produced, in which the susceptibility is assigned to each UCUs {{on the basis of the}} computed density function. In order to test the effects produced by selecting different diagnostic areas in the performance of the susceptibility models, validation procedures have been applied to evaluate and compare the performances of the derived predictive models. The validation results are estimated by comparing the prediction and the success rate curves, exploiting three morphometric indexes. A test area, the Guddemi river basin, was selected in the northern Sicilian Apennines chain, having a total area of nearly 25 km 2 and being mainly characterized by the outcropping of clays, calcilutites, and marly limestones. Aerial analysis, integrated with a field survey, resulted in the recognition of 111 earth-flow and 145 earth-rotational slide landslides. Scarps, for <b>rotational</b> <b>slides,</b> and both source and landslide areas, for flows, produced very satisfactory validation results. For <b>rotational</b> <b>slides,</b> areas uphill from crowns and landslide areas are both responsible for lower predictive performances, characterized by validation curves close to being flat shaped, due to their incapability of identifying specific slope (UCU) conditions. Moreover, because of their limited size, the areas uphill from crowns seem to suffer from a relevant geostatistical ‘‘instability’’, when a splitting is performed to produce the validation domains, so that an enhanced shift between success and prediction rate curves is produced. By comparing the relative susceptibility maps, {{the research}} allowed us to evaluate the key role played by the selection of the diagnostic areas; the validation of the models is proposed as a tool to quantify such differences in terms of predictive performance...|$|R

Most synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data-based landslide detection approaches reported in the literature use change detection techniques, requiring very high resolution (VHR) SAR imagery acquired shortly before the landslide event, which is commonly not available. Modern VHR SAR missions, e. g., Radarsat- 2, TerraSAR-X, or COSMO-SkyMed, do not systematically cover the entire world, due to limitations in onboard disk space and downlink transmission rates. Here, we present a fast and transferable procedure for mapping of landslides, based on change detection between pre-event optical imagery and the polarimetric entropy derived from post-event VHR polarimetric SAR data. Pre-event information is derived from high resolution optical imagery of Landsat- 8 or Sentinel- 2, which are freely available and systematically acquired over the entire Earth’s landmass. The landslide mapping is refined by slope information from a digital elevation model generated from bi-static TanDEM-X imagery.

40|$|Landslide hazard assessment, {{effected}} {{by means of}} geostatistical methods, {{is based on the}} analysis of the relationships between landslides and the spatial distributions of some instability factors. Frequently such analyses are based on landslide inventories in which each record represents the entire unstable area and is managed as a single instability landform. In this research, landslide susceptibility is evaluated through the study of a variety of instability landforms: landslides, scarps and areas uphill from crown. The instability factors selected were: bedrock lithology, steepness, topographic wetness index and stream power index. The instability landform densities computed for all the factors, which were arranged in Unique Condition Unit, allowed us to derive a total of three prediction images for each landslide typology.

Microfacies and microstructures of a 9 mlong sediment core are presented to discuss the depositional environment of deformed glacigenic and postglacial sequences deposited in the deep basin of the lake. Five distinct lithofacies are characterized. The range of glacial microstructures observed in the lower facies (Facies IV) reveals that high stress level occurred outside the crater during the formation of this diamicton released by the ablation of debris-rich basal glacier ice in an ice contact subglacial–proglacial lacustrine environment. The overlying subaqueous and glacigenic sediment gravity flow (Facies IIIb) {{is associated with a}} temporary absence of ice cover over the coring site, and likely results from the efflux plume and the associated suspension sedimentation produced during the retreat of the ice margin. Then, the finely laminated (< 1 – 2 mm) and normally graded meltout silts (Facies IIIa) containing dropstones and load cast featuressuggest underflows in an unstable ice marginal lacustrine environment hydrologically separated from the retreating glacier but containing floating glacial ice blocks. Microstructures within occasional diamictic layers indicate sudden meltout deposits from these drifting ice blocks. The above finer-grained sediments (Facies Ib) lack typical glacial microstructures, marking the onset of postglacial organic sedimentation.

The two major types of <b>slides</b> are <b>rotational</b> <b>slides</b> and translational slides. Rockslides are a type of translational event since the rock mass moves along a roughly planar surface with little rotation or backward tilting. Rock slides are the most dangerous form of mass-wasting because they incorporate a sudden, incredibly fast-paced release of bedrock along a uniform plane of weakness. These uniform weaknesses are key to identifying rock slides because unlike slumps, flows, or falls, the failed material moves in a fairly uniform direction over a layer of solid, pre-existing rock.

40|$|Numerical {{triaxial}} simulations {{using the}} discrete element method (DEM) {{were performed to}} examine how the adopted contact models and the associated parameters affect the response. The increase in the shear modulus G in the Hertz-Mindlin’s contact model can enhance the small-strain Young’s modulus and reduce the initial volumetric contraction but the influence from the Poisson’s ratio, ν, {{used in the same}} model can be neglected. Samples with a higher interparticle friction coefficient, fs, give rise to higher shear strength and greater volumetric dilation. However, the associated peak and critical-state friction angles, ∅p and ∅cs, have a non-proportional relationship with increasing fs. The addition of rolling resistance can render a similar effect to increasing fs but enable the overall response, including the resulting ∅p, ∅cs, εp (the strain at the peak strength), and dilatancy behavior, closer to the experimental observations. As the rolling coefficient, Jn, and the coefficient of <b>rotational</b> <b>sliding,</b> η, increase, the ∅p and ∅cs also increase until they both reach a limit and become saturated. Moreover, the resulting ∅p and ∅cs from the samples with a fixed rolling resistance but different fs also show a similar non-proportional response as fs increases. When fs reaches a certain value, the failure is mainly by <b>rotational</b> <b>sliding</b> and not by frictional <b>sliding</b> because <b>rotational</b> <b>sliding</b> can occur more easily. Hence, the frictional resistance cannot be fully developed and ∅p (or ∅cs) ceases to increase no matter how much fs increase. Similarly, when η reaches a certain value, the failure switches into a frictional sliding mode so ∅p (or ∅cs) also stops increasing even as η continues to increase. In this study, DEM simulations on triaxial creep tests of dense and loose samples were carried out to examine the involved micromechanics during creep in sand. The simulated creep responses fairly reproduce the published experimental results. During the primary creep, the creep rate continuously decreases. This is due to that the contact forces are gradually transferred from decreasing tangential to increasing normal forces to form columnar particle structures. The columnar structures eventually completed formed and the creep rate reaches a minimum. However, the structures become meta-stable and are susceptible to buckling. This explains why a sand packing does not show an extended period of the secondary creep in the experiment. Buckling of the columnar structures also gives rise to maximum dilatancy and a sharp transition of the major fabric orientation from the horizontal to the vertical directions. The continuous process of buckling of columnar structures increases the creep rate and sliding ratios during the tertiary creep. In addition, the trend that contact tangential forces decrease while contact normal forces increase is reversed. Finally creep rupture occurs as the creep stress-strain line intersects the complete stress-strain curve. All the creep samples follow their original volume-change tendency to continue the dilation or contraction response during creep...|$|R

40|$|Early {{detection}} and early warning are {{of great importance}} in giant landslide monitoring because of the unexpectedness and concealed nature of large-scale landslides. In China, the western mountainous areas are prone to landslides and feature many giant complex landslides, especially following the Wenchuan Earthquake in 2008. This work concentrates on a new technique, known as the “hybrid-SAR technique”, that combines both phase-based and amplitude-based methods to detect and monitor large-scale landslides in Li County, Sichuan Province, southwestern China. This work aims to develop a robust methodological approach to promptly identify diverse landslides with different deformation magnitudes, sliding modes and slope geometries, even when the available satellite data are limited. The phase-based and amplitude-based techniques are used to obtain the landslide displacements from six TerraSAR-X Stripmap descending scenes acquired from November 2014 to March 2015. Furthermore, the application circumstances and influence factors of hybrid-SAR are evaluated according to four aspects: (1) quality of terrain visibility to the radar sensor; (2) landslide deformation magnitude and different sliding mode; (3) impact of dense vegetation cover; and (4) sliding direction sensitivity. The results achieved from hybrid-SAR are consistent with in situ measurements. This new hybrid-SAR technique for complex giant landslide research successfully identified representative movement areas, e. g., an extremely slow earthflow and a creeping region with a displacement rate of 1 cm per month and a typical <b>rotational</b> <b>slide</b> with a displacement rate of 2 – 3 cm per month downwards and towards the riverbank.

Recorded observations include the locations of the outcrops of basal sliding surfaces, displacements at the main scarp and in {{the lower part of the}} slide, and a value to describe the total mass transport. Such sparse and inhomogeneous data were insufficient to derive a comprehensive documentation of the landslide or obtain adequate constraints for an accurate numerical analysis. Therefore, slider block models were fitted to the field data, which have only a small number of free parameters.

Surveyed landforms show a slope dynamic related to different types of slope movements: falls of blocks and loose materials, <b>rotational</b> <b>slides,</b> earth flows and colluvium translational slides that have to be considered very widespread; small dimensions characterise these slope movements. A concentration of slope instability phenomena has been surveyed in areas where human activities had been performed or in the surroundings. Slope stability analyses show that unstable areas are located in the medium-upper part of Monte Mario bedrock Unit, above and below sandstone strata. Moreover colluvial deposits become prone to sliding when perched water table and downslope seepage occur as a consequence of intense rainfall...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the analysis, design, and simulation {{of a novel}} microrobotic platform that is able to perform translational and <b>rotational</b> <b>sliding</b> with submicrometer positioning accuracy and develop velocities up to 1. 5 mm/s. The platform actuation system is novel and based on centripetal forces generated by vibration micromotors. The motion principle is discussed in detail, and the dynamic model of the platform and of its actuation system is developed. Analytical expressions for the distinct modes of operation of the platform are derived and used to provide system design guidelines. Simulations are performed that verify the analytical results, demonstrate the platform capabilities, and examine its transient response. The microrobot design is simple, compact, and of low cost. In addition, the energy supply of the {{mechanism can be accomplished}} in an unteth-ered mode using simple means, such as single-cell batteries. Copyright © 2006 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|Local reactivations of {{landslides}} in {{forests are}} rarely reported in landslide catalogues. The occurrence of hillslope sections with fresh morphological landslide features in forested old, deep-seated landslides, however, suggests that landslide reactivations are {{not restricted to}} residential areas. In this study, a dendrogeomorphological analysis of beech stands was used to investigate the periods of reactivation of a deep-seated <b>rotational</b> <b>slide</b> in the Koppenberg forest (Flemish Ardennes, Belgium). The relation to rainfall and the correspondence to landslide reactivations reported in a nearby built-up area were also analysed. A dendrometrical study preceding the dendrochronological analysis proved that, compared with the nearby reference site, trees on the Koppenberg forest landslide site were significantly more inclined and showed more knees, indicating that the landslide site has not stabilized yet. As the sampled trees are younger than the landslide, dendrochronology did not allow determination {{of the year in}} which the landslide was initiated, but analysis of two different tree ring width parameters (i. e. ring eccentricity and growth change) calculated for trees sampled on the Koppenberg landslide and the reference site proved to be of great help in determining the temporal sequence of landslide reactivation. During the past 80 years, several periods indicative of local reactivations (i. e. 1943 – 1945, 1949 – 1952, 1967 – 1970, 1972 – 1977, 1979 – 1981, 1988 – 1997) were found within the investigated landslide, but delineation of the spatial extent of the reactivations during these indicative periods was not straightforward. These periods generally correspond to years with above-average rainfall. Finally, the fact that at least 34 % of the years indicative of reactivation of the Koppenberg forest landslide correspond to a year in which a landslide reactivation was reported in the Flemish Ardennes suggests that in built-up areas, apart from anthropogenic interventions, natural triggering factors remain very important. status: publishe...|$|E

The properties of the slope forming materials are significant in the slope stability analysis. The study area is located at Kuala Balah, Jeli, Kelantan. The total area of the study are is 25 km 2 and bounded within the coordinate of 5 ° 26 ’ 10. 80 ” N, 101 ° 54 ’ 15. 00 ” E and 5 ° 23 ’ 28. 8 ” N, 101 ° 56 ’ 56. 40 ” E. The objectives {{of this study are}} to update the geological map of the Kuala Balah, Jeli, Kelantan with scale of 1 : 25 000, to produce slope failure inventory of the study area with slope geometry, mode/ type of failure, failure geometry, origin of soil/ rock, cause of failure, type of slope stabilization protection and vegetation cover of failure and to construct slope stability analysis for soil cut-slope at study area by using Slope/ W software. Geological mapping and engineering mapping were carried out to identify the geological features and the soil-cut-slope. Geological map of Kuala Balah, Jeli, Kelantan has been updated. The lithology consists of fine-grained granite, granodiorite, fine-grained biotite granite, quartzite, fine-grained gneiss, coarse-grained quartz-plagioclase gneiss, shale, mudstone and metasandstone. There are a total eight cut-slope failure observed in the study area. The inventory of slope failure is constructed. Most of the weathering grade of soil cut-slope is five and originated from shale. The mode of failure of all slope is <b>rotational</b> <b>slide</b> and protected by vegetation or Gabion retaining wall. Major causes of the failure are weathering process and rainfall.

40|$|The {{deformation}} of monolithic bulk-metallic glasses (BMGs), nanocrystal-containing, and micrometer-sized, ductile-particle-reinforced bulk metallic glass composites (BMGCs) has been investigated. The number density of shear bands, {{the interaction of}} shear bands with the particles, {{as well as the}} apparent plasticity was found to be significantly different in three types of samples before failure occurred. The interaction of shear bands with the micrometer-sized particles implied that shear bands can be initiated by stress concentration at the particle boundaries and, at the same time, absorbed by the {{deformation of}} particles. It is hypothesized that the observed number density and motion of shear bands could arise from the interaction of <b>rotational</b> <b>sliding</b> of medium range order (MRO) or dense-packed clusters, fine crystals, and the free volume in the material.
