50|$|In the Domesday Book (1086), a <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> {{done under}} William the Conqueror, {{the place is}} named Becheberie, and it is {{recorded}} that the lands and church in Bibury were held by St. Mary's Priory at Worcester, from whom it passed in 1130 to the Abbey of Osney, near Oxford: the Abbey continued to hold it until its dissolution in 1540.|$|E
5000|$|But, when {{negligence}} {{is followed}} by a natural event of such magnitude that it erases the physical effects of the original negligence, the defendant’s liability ceases at the moment in time when the supervening condition occurs. In Carslogie Steamship Co v. Royal Norwegian Government, the Carslogie collided with the Heimgar and admitted liability. Temporary repairs were effected with permanent repairs to be carried out later in the United States. After the collision but before crossing the Atlantic, the Heimgar was given a certificate of seaworthiness, authorising her to be continued in her present class without fresh <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey,</b> subject to permanent repairs at the owner's convenience. She was held fit to carry dry and perishable cargoes. While crossing the Atlantic, the Heimgar encountered heavy weather and sustained such serious damage as to become unseaworthy and to require immediate dry docking. Thus, prior to encountering the rough weather, the Heimgar was a seaworthy vessel, capable of earning profits for her owners. Repairs due to the collision and to the heavy weather, as well as the owner's repairs were all carried out at the same time. Ten of the fifty days in dry dock were allocated to the repair of the collision damage and the question for the House of Lords was whether the owners of the Carslogie were liable for that ten-day loss of earning capacity. The claim was for damages because a working ship is [...] "a profit-earning machine". If she ceases to earn a profit, it is essential to consider what caused the detention in dry dock at that time. In this case, the Heimgar was a profit-earning vessel before suffering the heavy weather damage. Thus, the loss of earnings at that time was not caused by the collision. Hence, The Oropesa demonstrates that where there are two successive causes of harm, the court may regard the first event as the cause of all the harm, or hold that the second supervening event reduces or eliminates the effect of the initial negligence as in Carslogie Steamship Co v. Royal Norwegian Government.|$|E

40|$|Proper monumentation is {{important}} in referencing a highway’s alignment, {{which is used to}} define its right of way. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) can contribute to the body of public records and minimize duplication of survey work by establishing and recording monuments that are tied to a state plane coordinate system and to a standard vertical datum. WSDOT is required by law to perpetuate existing recorded monuments (Chapter 58. 09 RCW). The department provides monuments for realignments and new highway alignments and perpetuates existing monuments impacted by a project. The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is designated as the official agency for surveys and maps. New monuments set to establish property corners, highway alignment, and so on, shall be recorded on a <b>Record</b> <b>of</b> <b>Survey</b> or Monumentation Map and filed with the DNR Public Land Survey Office and the appropriate county auditor or county engineer. Records of Survey and Monumentation Maps are retained at DNR. Geodetic monuments are established and the Headquarters (HQ) GeoMetrix Office retains their placement records. Geodetic monuments are recorded on a Report of Survey Mark. These records are made available to the public on the following website: www. wsdot. wa. gov/monument...|$|E
40|$|Sailors shipwrecked in {{the waters}} of early-modern East Asia were rescued and {{returned}} to their home country. When Chinese ships were wrecked off the coast of Japan, the Ryukyu Kingdom, and other such locations, a Chinese-language interpreter assisted the shipwrecked sailors. The <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the dialogues that took place at such times reflect how people using different languages conveyed what they wished to say to each other, and reveal their shared means of communication. This paper investigates the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>surveys</b> <b>of</b> shipwrecked Chinese sailors on the Korean Peninsula, which consist of questions posed by Chinese-language interpreters and responses from Chinese sailors, thus adopting a different angle to that taken by Matsuura Akira (2014) in his examination <b>of</b> such <b>records</b> <b>of</b> dialogues between shipwrecked Chinese sailors and Korean officials as <b>records</b> <b>of</b> communication by writing. This paper seeks to establish what kind of language and what kinds of methods were used to survey shipwrecked Chinese sailors on the Korean Peninsula, before going on to clarify the content and vocabulary of the questions posed, as well as offering observations on their value as linguistic source materials. The dialogues, which are likely to have been recorded on the basis of oral conversations as a <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>surveys</b> <b>of</b> shipwrecked sailors, demonstrate the possibility for inconsistencies to arise when recording the spoken word as against the written word, and also reflect contemporary colloquial speech...|$|R

50|$|A {{common use}} <b>of</b> a <b>survey</b> is to {{determine}} a legal property boundary. The first stage in such a survey, known as a resurvey, is to obtain copies of the deed description and all other available documents from the owner. The deed description {{is that of the}} deed and not a tax statement or other incomplete document. The surveyor should then obtain copies of deed descriptions and maps of the adjoining properties, any records from the municipality or county, utility maps, and any <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>surveys.</b> Depending on which region the survey is located in, some or most of this information may not be available or even exist. Whether the information exists or not, a thorough search should be conducted so that no records are overlooked. Copies of deeds usually can be located in the government recorder's office, and maps or plats can usually be found at the recorder or surveyor's office. These arrangements will vary state-to-state and survey-system-to-survey system, so some familiarity may be needed.|$|R
