5|$|Former {{city council}} {{president}} John F. Street was elected mayor in 1999 and city <b>revitalization</b> {{continued into the}} 21st century. The Street administration targeted some of the city's worst neighborhoods for <b>revitalization</b> and made considerable progress. Tax breaks created in 1997 and 2000 helped create a condominium boom in Center City, increasing the population of Center City and helping slow the city's 40-year population decline. The population of Center City rose to 88,000 in 2005 from 78,000 in 2000 {{and the number of}} households grew by 24 percent.|$|E

5|$|At present, {{the city}} of Lawton is {{undertaking}} the Downtown <b>Revitalization</b> Project. Its goal is to redesign the areas between Elmer Thomas Park at the north through Central Mall to the south to be more visually appealing and pedestrian friendly to encourage business growth in the area.|$|E
5|$|Citizens had {{a unique}} and {{powerful}} influence in neighborhood government. Neighborhoods coordinated activities under the Neighborhood <b>Revitalization</b> Program (NRP), which ended in 2009. Minneapolis is divided into communities, each containing neighborhoods. In some cases two or more neighborhoods act together under one organization. Some areas are commonly known by nicknames of business associations.|$|E
5|$|Despite city {{efforts at}} {{large-scale}} <b>revitalization,</b> {{by the beginning}} of the 21st century the downtown area consisted largely of the coal export facilities, the shipyard, and municipal offices. It is bordered by some harbor-related smaller businesses and lower income housing.|$|E
5|$|Focusing on a {{downtown}} <b>revitalization,</b> Harpole explored {{plans to build}} a baseball stadium in Amarillo.

5|$|In the 21st century, {{the city}} has {{improved}} infrastructure, is more diversified, has gained a national reputation in medical fields, and has invested in the arts. Cleveland is generally considered an example of <b>revitalization.</b> The city's goals include additional neighborhood <b>revitalization</b> and increased funding for public education. In 2009, {{it was announced that}} Cleveland was chosen to host the 2014 Gay Games, the fourth city in the United States to host this international event. On July 8, 2014, it was announced that Cleveland was chosen to be the host city of the 2016 Republican National Convention.|$|E

5|$|The 2013 census {{population}} estimate showed an increasing city of Dayton population {{for the first}} time in five decades, attributed to <b>revitalization</b> efforts downtown and the increasing downtown population. However, the 2014 population estimate indicates a net decrease of 897 individuals from 2013's estimate.|$|E
5|$|The city saw {{tremendous}} {{industrial and}} population growth during the 19th century and early 20th century, and experienced racial tension and urban decline {{in the second half}} of the 20th century, culminating in the 1967 Newark riots. The city has experienced <b>revitalization</b> since the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The devastated Point Pleasant Park {{remained}} {{closed for}} cleanup {{after the storm}} before re-opening in June 2004, nine months after the storm hit, with a damaged shoreline and almost 85% of its trees removed. A <b>revitalization</b> and reforestation program began in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The <b>revitalization</b> of {{businesses}} in the former village was credited to the influx of artists. Prior to the 1980s, store owners in Rosendale Village had either retired or died, and their shops had become residential or simply abandoned. Newcomers purchased these properties, restored them, and returned them to commercial service.|$|E
5|$|The <b>revitalization</b> of {{downtown}} Norfolk {{has helped to}} improve the Hampton Roads cultural scene. In particular, {{a large number of}} clubs, representing a wide range of music interests and sophistication now line the lower Granby Street area.|$|E

5|$|When Thompson assumed office, he {{continued}} his fight against economic blight with economic <b>revitalization</b> plans, with special focus on redevelopment of brownfield land, {{but he had to}} combat government inaction and bureaucracy in this effort.|$|E
5|$|A new School of Law {{building}} and parking garage were also {{constructed in the}} 1990s {{as part of the}} <b>revitalization</b> of downtown Newark. Seton Hall continues to be a leader in technology in education, as well as in distance learning, with its renowned Seton World Wide program. In 1998, all incoming full-time, first-year students were issued laptop computers as part of the University's innovative and nationally recognized mobile computing program.|$|E
5|$|Baird held ministerial {{responsibilities}} for the Toronto Harbourfront Centre and the Toronto Waterfront <b>Revitalization</b> Corporation.

Ontario cabinet minister David Caplan described Baird {{as a champion of}} waterfront renewal and Miller described him as an ally of the city. Baird spent Christmas 2006 meeting with Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th {{century and}} {{beginning}} of the 21st, <b>revitalization</b> and gentrification of historic neighborhoods attracted an increase in middle-class population as people began to return to the city. New immigrants from Southeast Asia, and Central and South America have contributed their energy to the city. Promotions and incentives in the 1990s and the early 21st century have improved the city's image and created a condominium boom in Center City and the surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Scarborough station {{dates back}} to the 1860s, when the first station {{building}} stood along the Hudson River Railroad, which was completed in 1851 and served areas from New York City to Rensselaer. It became part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Metro-North Railroad in 1983, when the service was created. The station was included in a <b>revitalization</b> plan in 2007 to help serve its commuters. The 1899 station building has housed the Scarborough post office since 1961.|$|E
5|$|From 1975 until 1982, $606 {{million of}} local and {{national}} community development funds were invested throughout the city. In the 1990s, the city pushed for <b>revitalization,</b> uncovering the rivers (which had been covered by paved bridges), relocating a large section of railroad underground, creating Waterplace Park and river walks along the rivers' banks, and constructing the Fleet Skating Rink (now the Alex and Ani City Center) and the 1.4 million ftÂ² Providence Place Mall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Jewish {{immigrants}} set up numerous businesses along the North 24th Street commercial area. It suffered {{with the loss}} of industrial jobs in the 1960s and later, the shifting of population west of the city. The commercial area is now the center of the African American community, concentrated in North Omaha. The African-American community has maintained its social and religious base, while it is currently experiencing an economic <b>revitalization.</b>|$|E
5|$|A primary issue {{during the}} {{election}} was {{the construction of a}} dam on the Red River. Cook opposed the dam, but Ford supported it and allocated some of the state's budget surplus to its construction. In the election, Ford defeated Cook by a vote of 399,406 to 328,982, completing his <b>revitalization</b> of the state's Democratic party by personally ousting the last Republican from major office. Cook resigned his seat in December so that Ford would have a higher standing in seniority in the Senate. Ford resigned as governor to accept the seat, leaving the governorship to Carroll, who dropped state support for the project, killing it.|$|E
5|$|A slip ramp {{was also}} planned in 2000 {{to connect to}} Lafayette Street in Norristown {{as part of a}} <b>revitalization</b> plan for the community. The project would involve {{extending}} Lafayette Street to the new ramp. This proposed slip ramp is projected to cost $160 million. Montgomery County officials have proposed a surcharge for the new exit in {{to help pay for the}} project. Work on engineering and environmental approval for the interchange occurred in 2008, and acquisition of land began in 2011. On January 7, 2015, the turnpike commission committed $45 million to building this interchange. Construction on the interchange at Lafayette Street may begin as soon as 2018.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Kappa Kappa Psi {{began an}} ambitious {{expansion}} program to reactivate old chapters and install new ones. The fraternity had been divided into 11 districts since 1941, which {{were led by}} a Grand Counselor (now called Governors). With the <b>revitalization</b> of the fraternity, these districts were reorganized and pamphlets were printed detailing the fraternity's purposes and history. District governors were charged with giving information to potential chapters. The expansion program was quite successfulâin the ten years following the fraternity's reorganization in 1947, Kappa Kappa Psi more than doubled the number of installed chapters, growing from 45 chapters installed before the war to 98 {{by the end of}} 1957.|$|E
5|$|At this point, relief {{arrived from}} an {{unexpected}} quarterâMaple Leafs owner Conn Smythe. The Depression had already forced three teams to either shut down outright or suspend operations never to return. Additionally, the New York Americans had been wards {{of the league}} since 1936, and it {{was considered to be}} {{only a matter of time}} before they folded (they eventually did, in 1942). Smythe did not want to see the Canadiens fold, and suggested that the Arena Company hire the Maple Leafs' former coach, Dick Irvin. Irvin was a proven winner, having led the Maple Leafs to seven finals and one Cup in nine years. The Arena Company readily accepted Smythe's suggestion, and turned to Irvin to lead the once-proud team's <b>revitalization.</b>|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Sloatsburg station {{dates back}} to the 1830s, when the station was built along the Erie Railroad. The station served the line heading to Port Jervis northward, along with a stagecoach to Greenwood Lake three times a day. The station was {{populated}} by fishermen {{on their way to the}} lake, but has been the site of several accidents. These calamities include a derailed milk train in 1843 and a fatal accident between the train line and several mules and their owner in 1855. The station became part of Metro-North in 1983, when the service was created. The station was listed under a <b>revitalization</b> plan in 2005 to help serve its commuters.|$|E
5|$|Despite its name, Old Louisville was {{actually}} {{built as a}} suburb of Louisville starting in the 1870s, nearly a century after Louisville was founded. It was initially called the Southern Extension, and the name Old Louisville did not come until the 1960s. Old Louisville was initially {{home to some of}} Louisville's wealthiest residents, but saw a decline in the early and mid-20th century. Following <b>revitalization</b> efforts and gentrification, Old Louisville is currently home to a diverse population with a high concentration of students and young professionals.|$|E
5|$|During a {{national}} recession from 2001 to 2003, the city lost 28,000 jobs. In response, a development initiative, Vision 2025, promised to incite {{economic growth and}} recreate lost jobs. Projects spurred by the initiative promised urban <b>revitalization,</b> infrastructure improvement, tourism development, riverfront retail development, and further diversification of the economy. As of 2007, employment levels have surpassed pre-recession heights and the city is in a significant economic development and investment surge. This economic improvement is also seen in Tulsa's housing trends which show an average of a 6% increase in rent in 2010. Since 2006, more than 28,000 jobs {{have been added to}} the city. The unemployment rate of Tulsa in August 2014 was 4.5%.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{life-threatening}} drug addiction that developed {{after leaving the}} Chili Peppers in 1992, Frusciante made a full recovery after a month of drug rehabilitation during {{the early months of}} 1998. Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the Red Hot Chili Peppers. After several months of writing and recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, Californication was released. The album went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording to date. Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial <b>revitalization</b> from their previous record, One Hot Minute. A two-year-long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances, including Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt {{was elected}} to the Portland City Council in 1970 and then as mayor of Portland in 1972, {{becoming}} the youngest mayor of any major American city. He promoted the <b>revitalization</b> of Downtown Portland and was influential on Portland-area transportation policy, particularly with the abandonment of the Mount Hood Freeway and the establishment of the MAX Light Rail. He was appointed U.S. Secretary of Transportation by President Jimmy Carter in 1979; in that capacity he worked to revive the ailing automobile industry and to deregulate several industries. He served until the end of Carter's presidency in 1981 and then served as a senior executive with Nike for several years.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 2010, the U.S. House of Representatives {{approved}} the Rare Earths and Critical Materials <b>Revitalization</b> Act of 2010 (H.R.6160). The approved legislation {{is aimed at}} restoring the U.S. as a leading producer of rare-earth elements, and would support activities in the U.S. Department of Energy (US DoE) to discover and develop rare-earth sites inside of the U.S. {{in an effort to}} reduce the auto industry's near-complete dependence on China for the minerals. A similar bill, the Rare Earths Supply Technology and Resources Transformation Act of 2010 (S. 3521), is being discussed in the U.S. Senate.|$|E

5|$|The Smart Street Initiative, a 20-year plan to {{make the}} city safer for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists, began in 2013 with the {{conversion}} of one-way streets to two-way streets. The hope is to bring more businesses to the area, create shorter travel routes, and to reduce speeding. This phase {{of the project was}} expected to be completed by 2016. The other part of the initiative is the West Side Main Streets Plan, which is a <b>revitalization</b> plan for the Lincoln Way West and Western Avenue corridor focusing on guiding business owners, residents, and developers to improve the street front by offering a reimbursement on exterior improvements from the city and the Urban Enterprise Association.|$|E
