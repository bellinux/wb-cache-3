50|$|A grade II* listed building, {{the theatre}} was first {{built as a}} Music hall in 1863, as MacDonald's Music hall. It is an unrestored example of the saloon-style. In the theatre, an iron-railed, two tier galleried {{auditorium}} <b>rises</b> on three <b>sides,</b> <b>supported</b> on cast iron columns, above a small, high, multi-tiered stage. It survives, largely in its original form, as for many years it {{was used as a}} Quaker meeting house.|$|R
50|$|Another {{difference}} is that under most practical circumstances, dissolved gases, vapor pressure, and (sometimes) lack of adhesion with tube walls, conspire to render the tensile strength within the liquid ineffective for siphoning. Thus, unlike a chain which has significant tensile strength, liquids usually have little tensile strength under typical siphon conditions, and therefore the liquid on the <b>rising</b> <b>side</b> cannot be pulled up, {{in the way the}} chain is pulled up on the <b>rising</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this naturalistic study was to {{investigate}} the effect of booster seat design on the choice of children’s seating positions during naturalistic riding. Data was collected through observations of children during in-vehicle riding by means of a film camera. The children were positioned in high back boosters in the rear seat while a parent drove the car. The study included two different booster designs: one with large head and torso <b>side</b> <b>supports,</b> and one with small head <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> and no torso <b>side</b> <b>supports.</b> Six children between three and six years of age participated in the study. Each child was observed in both boosters. The duration of the seating positions that each child assumed was quantified. The design with large <b>side</b> head <b>supports</b> resulted more often in seating positions without head and shoulder contact with the booster’s back. There was shoulder-to-booster back contact during an average of 45 % of riding time in the seat with the large head <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> compared to 75 % in the seat with the small head supports. The children in the study were seated with the head in front of the front edge of the head <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> more than half the time, in both boosters. Laterally, the children were almost constantly positioned between the <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> of the booster in both seats. The observed seating positions probably reduce the desired protective effect by the <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> in <b>side</b> impact, and may increase the probability of head impact with the vehicle interior in frontal impact...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} model, {{based on}} fracture mechanics analysis, is proposed for estimating the minimum wafer thickness {{as a function}} of the diameter requirement for solar cells. The conditions under which the model can be applied are discussed with reference to the critical flaw size, the applied force, and the width of the <b>side</b> <b>support.</b> It is shown that the equivalent cantilever force applied during ID slicing can be estimated from the wafering mechanical yield data. The width of the wafer <b>side</b> <b>support</b> was found to be a significant factor in controlling the minimum allowable wafer thickness during slicing. Wafer <b>side</b> <b>support</b> width requirements were found to increase with decreasing wafer thickness...|$|R

40|$|Several {{factors can}} affect the {{behaviour}} of the hollowcore floor slabs in fire. This paper analytically investigates {{the relationship between the}} fire resistance of the overall floor system and the floor length to width ratio as well as the type of <b>side</b> <b>supports.</b> The study uses beam grillage and shell elements to model the hollowcore slabs and the topping concrete under the platform of the non-linear finite element program, SAFIR. Different methods to model precast, prestressed concrete hollowcore floor slabs subjected to fire are also investigated. The results show that <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> can enhance the fire performance of hollowcore floor slabs provided that the spacing of the <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> does not greatly exceed the span length...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the fire {{performance}} of hollowcore units is significantly affected by the end support conditions, but it has not been clear how the fire resistance of the overall floor system can be improved by providing <b>side</b> <b>supports.</b> The previous studies used beam grillage and shell elements to separately model the hollowcore units and the topping concrete slab using the platform of the non-linear finite element program SAFIR. The modelling method required a lot of computational resources and is not ideal to model a large floor area. This paper describes the effect of the <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> and the aspect ratio of the floor on the predicted fire resistance. It also compares the efficiencies of shell elements and short beam elements for finite element modelling of the topping concrete in fire conditions. The results show that integrating the topping concrete slab into the beam grillages reduces the complexity of the model and also provides satisfactory results. <b>Side</b> <b>supports</b> can increase the fire performance of hollowcore floor slabs provided that the spacing of the <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> does not greatly exceed the span length...|$|R

Irwandi Yusuf got more support from the grass root level and won {{the election}}.

In the event, the gubernatorial election due to be held at the end of 2011 was delayed by procedural squabbling as different factions scrambled for advantage.
