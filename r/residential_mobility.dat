40|$|Research on {{migration}} decisionmaking {{has been}} {{centered on the}} notion that <b>residential</b> satisfaction and <b>mobility</b> intentions are intervening variables which fully mediate the effects of structural factors on moving behavior. Results from empirical studies, however, have rendered only modest support for this view. The author examines the role of <b>residential</b> satisfaction and <b>mobility</b> intentions vis-�-vis structural variables in migration decisionmaking with the aid of data drawn from the 1985 - 1989 waves of the American Housing Survey. A conceptual model is derived which is based on behavioral theories developed in social psychology, namely the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior. Several previously ignored links among structural variables, mobility predispositions, and moving behavior are incorporated. Empirical analyses show that, although satisfaction and intentions are important predictors of mobility, most of the structural variables that are commonly known to be related to migration also have direct effects on subsequent moving behavior, independent of satisfaction and intentions. The theories of reasoned action and planned behavior provide a theoretical framework for {{a better understanding of the}} complex relationships between structural variables, <b>residential</b> satisfaction, <b>mobility</b> intentions, and behavior. ...|$|R

50|$|An {{experimental}} Hoabinhian assemblage {{was created}} and analyzed by Marwick (2008), which identified variables and methods {{that are the}} most useful in analyzing Hoabinhian assemblages. In particular he advocated {{for the use of}} a new method involving the dorsal cortex location of a flake. This method in particular was found to be especially useful in determining reduction intensity and may prove instrumental in answering broader archaeological questions involving subsistence, geographic range, and domestication. Based on Marwick's own research and Shoocongdej's (2000, 2006), behavioral ecological models were applied to examine human behavior through lithic assemblages which found in Tham Lod and Ban Rai rockshelters. In theory, high frequencies of pre-processing should reflect logistical mobility strategy. However, at Tham Lod, a high frequencies of pre-processing (CPM) but a <b>residential</b> <b>mobility</b> strategy (ODM) and a low intensity of occupation (PCM) was observed: We can see an internal conflict between models. An multiple optima model is proposed to explain this contradictory result. Multiple optima model allows more than one optimal scenario and is valid to explain high time-devoting lithic technology (i.e., pre-processing of lithic) and more <b>residential</b> <b>mobility</b> strategy in the same time.|$|E

It provides information on trends in the population structures of the different housing types brought about by vacancies-reoccupancies.
