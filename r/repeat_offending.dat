40|$|Background: Criminal {{offending}} {{is strongly}} transmitted across generations. Aims: To clarify {{the contribution of}} rearing environment to crossgenerational transmission of crime. Method: Using Swedish national registries, we identified 1176 fullsibling and 3085 half-sibling sets from high-risk families where at least one sibling was adopted and the other raised by the biological parents. Results: Risk for criminal conviction was substantially lower in the fulland half-siblings who were adopted v. home-reared (hazard ratios (HR) = 0. 56, 95 % CI 0. 50 - 0. 64 and 0. 60, 95 % CI 0. 56 - 0. 65, respectively). The protective effect of adoption was significantly stronger in sibships with two v. one high-risk parent. Conclusions: Using matched high-risk full- and half-siblings, we found replicated evidence that (a) rearing environment has a strong impact on risk for criminal conviction, (b) high-quality rearing environments have especially strong effects in those at high familial risk for criminal offending and (c) the protective effects of adoption are stronger for more severe crimes and for <b>repeated</b> <b>offending...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose. This study {{examined}} {{the degree to which}} child sex offenders demonstrated crossover in victim choice, as defined by age, gender, and relationship to the offender. It also aimed to explore the direction of the shift in victim type with <b>repeated</b> <b>offending</b> within each of the three domains and to identify variables predictive of crossover behaviour. Method. The sample comprised 128 adult male child sexual offenders. All had offended against multiple victims and were attending a community-based assessment and treatment service for sexual offenders at the time of data collection. Variables were gathered, coded, and de-identified from a manual search through clinical casenotes, from client assessment reports as well as from supplementary information consisting of sentencing remarks or other professional reports. Results. More than half of the sample (63. 3 %, N = 81) demonstrated crossover in victim type across at least one domain. Crossover was 48. 0 % (N = 59) in the age domain, 22. 0 % (N = 28) in the gender domain, and 25. 8 % (N = 33) in the relationship to victim domain. Crossover offending was associated with number of victims but unrelated to frequency of offending or to recidivism risk as assessed by a standard risk assessment instrument. Transitional matrices showed general stability in victim type across offences within the gender and relationship domains, but lower stability within the age domain. Conclusions. Crossover offending behaviour was found to be frequent in the age domain, but the high frequency of crossover in this domain may be artifactual. Crossover offending was less frequent in the gender and relationship domains, but should be taken into account in risk assessment. Victim type shows stability across multiple offences in the gender and relationship to victim domains. Analysis of victim type across multiple offences should be replicated under conditions where disclosure of offending is maximized. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between salivary cortisol and frequency of past driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} (DUI) convictions. Methods: A total of 104 males with previous DUI convictions (from one to eight) and mean age of 44. 7 years were assessed on measures characterizing repeat DUI offenders, including sociodemographic information, alcohol use behaviours, biological indices of the organic consequences of chronic abuse, negative consequences of excessive drinking, past DUI conviction history, impulse control, and antisocial behaviour tendencies. Saliva samples were taken approximately every 30 min over a 6 h period during an exhaustive multidimensional assessment protocol, and were then assayed to obtain cortisol responses. Results: Blunted cortisol response, typically observed in alcoholics and in high-risk non-alcoholics, was associated with increased number of past DUI convictions. This association was particularly pronounced in multiple DUI offenders, and was stronger than, and independent of, other measures of alcohol use severity and chronicity commonly used for DUI assessment.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of marine park management in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, in achieving conservation and ecological sustainable use objectives was examined using three key determinants: 1) assessment of allowable activities put in practice to meet marine park and zoning objectives; 2) {{assessment of the}} {{effectiveness of}} marine park integration with fisheries management; and, 3) effectiveness of compliance to ensure that legislated plans and management strategies were enforced. The selection and planning of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in NSW was found to be consistent with international and national guidelines, and key commitments set at international, national and state levels of government had been fully or partially met. A quantitative gap analysis on ecosystem and habitat representation demonstrated that NSW was well advanced and in a strong position to achieve current 2020 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) MPA targets. A qualitative risk assessment of permitted activities in relation to zoning objectives indicated considerable variation between NSW MPAs, but more concerning was that multiple use zones might not be achieving their stated objectives, with several allowable activities being inconsistent with zoning objectives. Performance indicators to evaluate effectiveness of integration between MPA and fisheries management activities were developed and indicated that positive impacts had resulted from this partnership for the NSW case study. It was concluded that the partnership process could have been improved through formal arrangements being developed and with particular attention being given to community and stakeholder communication and engagement. Empirical evidence suggested that adopting manageability criteria for compliance during the design and planning of MPAs could lead to a marked increase in voluntary compliance. It was demonstrated that the majority of zones in the Port Stephens - Great Lakes Marine Park were relatively effective in optimizing voluntary compliance. Analyses of compliance data from 2007 - 2013 indicated encouraging trends in compliance in NSW marine parks, with the MPA offence rate declining over this period, {{with the exception of the}} Jervis Bay Marine Park. Despite evidence that offenders were deterred from <b>repeating</b> <b>offending,</b> general deterrence for first time offenders remained an issue in all NSW marine parks. The current level of non-compliance is concluded to not being conducive in achieving anticipated conservation objectives of the marine park system. Overall, this study has provided solid guidance for future improvements in marine park management, in particular providing recommendations for improved zoning design, more effective compliance and improving integration between MPA and fisheries management...|$|R

Methods: A systematic search was conducted in 6 bibliographic databases from January 1966 to January 2009, supplemented with correspondence with authors. Studies that reported risks of <b>repeat</b> <b>offending</b> in individuals with psychotic disorders (n = 3511) compared with individuals with other psychiatric disorders (n = 5446) and healthy individuals (n = 71 [*] 552) were included.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, comorbidity patterns, and the relationship between psychiatric disorders and <b>repeat</b> <b>offending</b> among a cross-section of youths detained in a male juvenile detention center in South Korea. Methods One hundred seventy-three juvenile detainees were recruited. The distribution of psychiatric disorders within the sample was estimated by applying criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV. Logistic regression was used to assess significant comorbidity patterns and relationships between psychiatric disorders and <b>repeat</b> <b>offending.</b> Results In all, 90. 8 % of the detainees had at least one psychiatric diagnosis, and 75. 1 % had psychiatric comorbidities. The most common psychiatric disorder was alcohol use disorder, followed by conduct disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Among the comorbidities present, alcohol use disorder with disruptive behavior disorder was the most common combination. The presence of two psychiatric disorders was associated with a higher rate of recidivism, and alcohol use disorder was also associated with <b>repeat</b> <b>offending</b> when combined with disruptive behavior disorders, but not with anxiety disorders, major depression, or psychotic disorders.

40|$|M. Cur. South Africa {{is called}} the Rainbow Nation {{with a variety of}} {{cultures}} and ethnic groups. The population currently is estimated at over 40 million, of whom 73 % are women and children (Government Gazette, 1997 : 11). According to the Government Gazette (1997 : 11) major disparities and inequalities exist between the different population groups, with reference to their socio-economic position. This inevitably led to major problems such as poverty and violence. One of these problems of violence seems to be domestic violence as stated by the South African Police Service (1998 : 10). They confirmed that the number of incidents of domestic violence in which especially women, children and the elderly are the victims, appear to be continually on the increase in South Africa. The South African Police Service (1998 : 1) states that domestic violence is a serious crime against society, which can lead to repeated victimisation and <b>repeated</b> <b>offending</b> and sometimes eventually spirals into fatality. Domestic violence became a topic of interest to the researcher {{because of the number of}} women that came under her attention while working in the community services. Evaluation of the service delivery and understanding of domestic violence by community members and health care workers showed poor results with some still clinging to myths coming from cultural beliefs. According to Hague and Wilson (2000 : 157) the most common explanation for domestic violence continues to be a lack of compliance by the wife, coupled with historically long-lived ideas about the breadwinner's rightful authority. The goal of this study was to explore and describe the lived experience of abused women subjected to domestic violence and to describe guidelines for psychiatric nurse practitioners to support abused women who are subjected to domestic violence, in facilitating their mental health and optimising their ability to terminate the abusive situation. In conducting this research the framework of the Theory for Health Promotion in Nursing (Rand Afrikaans University, 2000) were used, which dealt with the internal and external world experience of the abused women. A qualitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual research design was used specific to domestic violence for this study. In-depth, semi-structured phenomenological interviews were conducted with abused women subjected to domestic violence who met the sample criteria. To ensure trustworthiness, the researcher made use ofGuba's (DeVos, 1998 : 348 - 350) model of trustworthiness. Data analysis was done according to Tesch's (DeVos, 1998 : 343 - 352) method. The results of this study showed that abused women who are subjected to domestic violence suffer a great deal of trauma and degrading due to physical or mental abuse of a loved one. Their trauma was evident by the experience of negative psychological dynamics that contributed to the shattering of the self. The degrading of the person eventually leads to the shattering of other relations and at the end to the realisation that they are victims...|$|R
40|$|This {{review paper}} follows on from a {{previous}} {{review of the literature}} with regard to learning disability and murder (Read, S. 2008). This paper, in turn, examines the relationship, if any, between learning disability and fire setting. The approach taken in both these papers involves the concept of Disruptive Behaviour Disorder as being the group of behaviour and personality disorders most involved in the aetiology of these criminal and anti-social behaviours. Disruptive behaviour disorders (Read, 2007) comprise: Oppositional Defiant Disorder Conduct Disorder Anti-social Personality Disorder Intermittent Explosive Disorder (DSM IVR, 2001, APA) The common characteristics of these disorders comprise aggression, irritability, over-activity, high arousal, and repetitive behaviour. In this context, perhaps we can see there is a continuum of offences. As we will show in the third paper (on Learning Disability and Sexual Offence), the sexual offences most often carried out by individuals with an intellectual disability are those of a less serious nature (for example, exhibitionism or indecent assault), than compared to the more serious sexual offence of aggravated rape. If serious crime involving individuals with a learning disability can then be graded as to gravity along a continuum from sexual offence to arson, through to murder as the most serious, then the involvement of learning disabled people becomes less as the offence becomes more serious then the involvement of learning disabled people becomes less as the offence becomes more serious. Consequently, a conclusion of the paper concerning murder was that learning disabled people are not disproportionately involved. This is not true of arson, where learning disabled people are over-represented (however, this over-representation should be treated with some caution as there may be methodological problems within studies that support this finding). This paper, as with the paper concerned with murder (Read, 2008), shows that the predominant diagnoses of arsonists are those in the group of Disruptive Behaviour Disorders. Mental illness is a minority diagnosis amongst those firesetters who suffer from learning disability. This accords well with the Review findings of Whitaker and Read (2007), who evidenced that there is little to support the notion that learning disabled people suffer disproportionately high levels of mental illness. However, behaviour and personality disorders are over-represented. The aetiology of these conduct and personality disorders is not so clear and these review papers regarding murder and arson relate the common occurrence of environmental factors in the developmental years as being of direct relevance to the offending behaviour as well as the association with learning disability which dates from birth or very early years. Such observations are seen to have import with regard to treatment which is likely to be as much supervisory, educational and psychological as it is pharmacological. Medical treatment cannot be ignored as it represents the first step in psychiatric rehabilitation, involving as it does the drug treatment of conduct and personality disorders. However other treatment modalities, importantly individually tailored, are liable to be of great importance with regard to reducing risk of <b>repeated</b> <b>offending...</b>|$|R
