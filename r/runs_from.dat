5|$|The tournament {{began on}} 30 July at Headingley in Leeds, where the Loughborough Lightning faced the Yorkshire Diamonds. The Lightning batted first and scored 128 for nine, led by 52 <b>runs</b> <b>from</b> their New Zealand international, Sophie Devine. The Diamonds began their {{response}} well, and their captain, Lauren Winfield scored 23 <b>runs</b> <b>from</b> just 13 balls {{before she was}} run out. There was some controversy regarding the dismissal; Winfield felt {{that she had been}} impeded by the bowler, but the umpires upheld the dismissal. Regular wickets and miserly bowling from the Lightning attack restricted Yorkshire's batsmen, and they were eventually all out for 85, giving the Lightning a 43-run victory. The following day saw two low-scoring matches; the Surrey Stars were restricted to 85 <b>runs</b> <b>from</b> their 20 overs by a economic Southern Vipers bowling attack. Nat Sciver managed to score 36 runs for the Stars late in the innings, but the Vipers scored 66 <b>runs</b> <b>from</b> their opening partnership, including 41 <b>runs</b> <b>from</b> 43 balls for Georgia Adams to help them towards their target. They won with six wickets and 28 balls to spare. In the other fixture that day, the Lancashire Thunder reached 65 for four, but then a spell of bowling from Heather Knight and Stafanie Taylor for the Western Storm saw the Thunder dismissed all out for 83 runs. Taylor finished with four wickets, while Knight took three. In their batting response, Knight and Taylor were again the best performers; Knight scored 23 and Taylor 14 as the Storm chased down the total with 27 balls remaining.|$|E
