5|$|Kilroy made {{an issue}} of Pryce's {{knowledge}} of the Foley scandal {{and the need for}} Hastert to resign. Kilroy also linked her opponent to the unpopular <b>Republican</b> <b>administration</b> and congressional majority. After Foley resigned following the page scandal, Kilroy attacked Pryce with the conservative religious voters. Kilroy ran radio commercials on Christian and conservative radio stations in an attempt to appeal to family-values-oriented listeners.|$|E
5|$|From 1951 to 1953, Uanna was {{the special}} {{assistant}} to the Secretary of Commerce as Chief of the Facilities Protection Board, and was a staff member of the Industrial Evaluations Board. These boards were overseen by the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security (ICIS) and the National Security Resources Board (NSRB). The NSRB was charged with developing security programs for industry and several were developed jointly with representatives from the power, transportation, explosives, petroleum, and communications industries. Since he was directly responsible to the Secretary of Commerce, after the <b>Republican</b> <b>Administration</b> took office in 1953, Uanna found himself without a job.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. had granted full de jure {{recognition}} to all three Baltic states by July 1922. The recognitions were granted during the shift from the Democratic administration of Woodrow Wilson to the <b>Republican</b> <b>administration</b> of Warren Harding. While the U.S. did not sponsor any meaningful political or economic initiatives in the region during the interwar period, and its administrations did not consider the states strategically important, it maintained normal diplomatic relations with the states.|$|E

5|$|Swiatek and Breen {{described}} the Alabama half dollar as {{caught up in}} the presidential election of 1920, as a <b>Republican</b> <b>administration</b> might not be willing to put the Democrat Wilson on a coin, or might insist on the new incumbent appearing, something likely to dampen sales in Alabama, part of the Democratic Solid South. The Republican, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, won the election and was inaugurated in March 1921. On June 29, 1921, Owen wrote to Baker, suggesting a new pair of honorees for the coin: Kilby, the state's chief executive {{at the time of the}} 1919 centennial, and the State of Alabama's first governor, William Bibb. Cartoonist Frank Spangler of the Montgomery Advertiser prepared sketches of the new design. At James Fraser's suggestion, the plaster models were created by his wife, Laura Gardin Fraser, who was a noted sculptor in her own right. She shipped her completed work to the Commission of Fine Arts on September 22, 1921, and gained members' approval; the models were then sent to the Philadelphia Mint for use in making coinage dies. Laura Fraser thus became the first woman to design a coin, not only of the U.S., but of any country.|$|E
25|$|Ames was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of a}} veteran's home in Minneapolis. He initially promoted the idea at the state's Democratic convention in 1886. Despite losing the election, the <b>Republican</b> <b>administration</b> accepted his suggestions and authorized the construction of the Minnesota Veterans Home. Ames later served there as a surgeon.|$|E
25|$|Despite an {{overwhelming}} Democratic majority, the 86th United States Congress {{was not able}} to accomplish much of their agenda since the President had immense popularity and a veto pen. With the 1960 elections nearing, congressional Democrats sought issues on which they could conspicuously oppose the <b>Republican</b> <b>administration.</b> The Strauss nomination proved tailor made.|$|E
50|$|Bob Goodlatte {{voted to}} {{increase}} the U.S. debt ceiling seven times and has voted to pass budgets from Democratic as well as <b>Republican</b> <b>administrations.</b> He voted for Bill Clinton's Budget Act in July, 1997 and Barack Obama's Budget Act of 2011.|$|R

50|$|A staunch Republican {{and generous}} donor to the Republican Party, Roach enjoyed the {{patronage}} of successive <b>Republican</b> <b>administrations,</b> but the Democrats continued to suspect him of obtaining government contracts not through merit but from favoritism and jobbery with a corrupt Navy Department. While Roach may indeed {{have benefited from}} a degree of favoritism under <b>Republican</b> <b>administrations,</b> no credible evidence was ever presented to substantiate the allegations of corruption made against him, and indeed his ability to regularly undercut his competitors sometimes saved the government considerable sums of money. Suspicions persisted however, and when the Democratic administration of Grover Cleveland assumed office, it repudiated a partly completed set of government contracts with Roach, driving the Roach shipyard into receivership.|$|R
25|$|Both John Carmody (FWA Administrator) and Colonel Lawrence Westbrook {{continued}} to be devoted to the mutual housing concept and discussed the final disposal of the eight projects {{in keeping with the}} original mutual housing plan. As late as 1952 Westbrook was looking for ways to resurrect this middle-class public housing effort but this plan was abandoned with the election of the <b>Republican</b> <b>administration</b> of Dwight Eisenhower.|$|E
25|$|The Union's {{recruitment}} of slaves {{into the army}} (which gained them freedom) turned some slaveholders in Kentucky against the US government. In later years, the depredations of guerrilla warfare in the state, together with Union measures to try to suppress it, and the excesses of General Burbridge as military governor of Kentucky, were probably more significant in alienating more citizens. Civic rights were overridden during the crisis. These issues turned many against the <b>Republican</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Parliament of Northern Ireland {{came into}} being in June 1921. At its inauguration, in Belfast City Hall, King George V made a famous appeal for Anglo-Irish and north–south reconciliation. The speech, drafted by the {{government}} of David Lloyd George on recommendations from Jan Smuts Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, with the enthusiastic backing of the King, opened the door for formal contact between the British Government and the <b>Republican</b> <b>administration</b> of Éamon de Valera.|$|E
5000|$|Wohlstetter and his wife, Roberta Wohlstetter, also counseled both Democratic and <b>Republican</b> <b>administrations,</b> {{including}} {{advisers to}} President John F.

5|$|Estimates {{ranged from}} 400 to 700 to 900 {{unauthorized}} file disclosures. The incident caused an intense burst of criticism {{because many of}} the files covered White House employees from previous <b>Republican</b> <b>administrations,</b> including top figures such as James Baker, Brent Scowcroft, and Marlin Fitzwater.|$|R

25|$|Through the {{initiative}} of Father Francisco Pinto Ferreira, on 22 June 1916, during an easing of tensions between the Church and <b>Republican</b> <b>administration,</b> the Marian Cult, the Congregação das Filhas de Maria (Congregatio {{of the children of}} Mary) was established. On 20 February 1923, chandeliers are fixed to the site, produced by a sawmiller from Moimeta mounted by mason José da Costa. On 14 July 1929, the Ministry of Justice transferred the sanctuary to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lamego.|$|E
25|$|With a new <b>Republican</b> <b>administration</b> in the White House, Jackson was {{a likely}} {{contender}} {{for a federal}} appointment, especially since he had known George W. Bush, the Texas governor declared {{the winner of the}} 2000 presidential election, since 1989, when both lived in the same Dallas neighborhood. In early 2001 Jackson's name was approved by Congress to serve as the deputy secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), a post that essentially made him second-in-command {{and chief operating officer of}} the cabinet department, working under HUD Secretary Mel Martinez.|$|E
25|$|Both the {{outgoing}} <b>Republican</b> <b>Administration</b> {{and the new}} Democratic Administration offered Congress proposed legislation to reform the FSP in 1977. The Republican bill stressed targeting benefits to the neediest, simplifying administration, and tightening controls on the program; the Democratic bill focused on increasing access to those most in need and simplifying and streamlining a complicated and cumbersome process that delayed benefit delivery as well as reducing errors, and curbing abuse. The chief force for the Democratic Administration was Robert Greenstein, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS).|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s, Norwegian {{media was}} limited to NRK TV and radio {{broadcasts}} with Oslo {{at the center of}} political analysis.

5000|$|He {{wrote his}} autobiography, [...] "Tax Dodgers" [...] in 1942. He relates stories of how President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) used the IRS to attack his {{political}} enemies. One was Andrew Mellon, who was Secretary of the Treasury during previous <b>Republican</b> <b>administrations.</b> Mellon was found innocent of all charges.|$|R
25|$|In December 1860, {{the final}} {{session of the}} Thirty-sixth Congress met. In the House, the Committee of Thirty-Three, with one member from each state, led by Ohio Republican Thomas Corwin, was formed to reach a {{compromise}} to preserve the Union. In the Senate, former Kentucky Whig John J. Crittenden, elected as a Unionist candidate, submitted the Crittenden compromise, six proposed constitutional amendments that he hoped would address all the outstanding issues. Hopes were high, especially in the Border States, that the lame duck Congress could reach a successful resolution before the new <b>Republican</b> <b>administration</b> took office.|$|E
25|$|There were {{concerns}} {{that if the}} EDC was not ratified as they wanted, the US <b>Republican</b> <b>Administration</b> might withdraw into defending only the Western Hemisphere (although recent documentary evidence confirms that the US intended to withdraw troops from Europe anyway if the EDC was ratified). After the French Assembly rejected the EDC in September 1954, Eden tried {{to come up with}} a viable alternative. Between 11 and 17 September he visited every major West European capital, to negotiate West Germany becoming a sovereign state and entering the Brussels pact prior to entering NATO. Paul-Henri Spaak said he “saved the Atlantic alliance”.|$|E
25|$|By 1830, Federal {{land policy}} {{had long been}} an issue. The National <b>Republican</b> <b>administration</b> had held land prices high. According to Adams' Secretary of the Treasury Richard Rush, this served to provide the federal {{government}} with an additional source of revenue, but also to discourage westward migration that tended to increase wages through the increased scarcity of labor. Senator Hayne, {{in an effort to}} sway the west against the north and the tariff, seized upon a minor point in the land debate and accused the north of attempting to limit western expansion for their own benefit. As Vice President Calhoun was presiding officer over the Senate but could not address the Senate in business, James Schouler contended that Hayne was doing what Calhoun could not.|$|E
25|$|The CPPA's Philip Smith has commented publicly, on {{a number}} of occasions, about U.S. {{intelligence}} community and Central Intelligence Agency figures, and operations, including Vietnam and Cold War era figures and activities, undertaken by both Democratic and <b>Republican</b> <b>Administrations,</b> including such officials as William Colby, Tony Poe, Lawrence Devlin and others.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} the lack of evidence, Dana never {{retracted}} the charges of corruption he had levelled against Roach in the pages of The Sun. Roach's name had become tainted by his association with Robeson, and Democrats in particular continued to suspect him of receiving favorable treatment from successive <b>Republican</b> <b>administrations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Navarro {{has served}} {{in a number of}} <b>Republican</b> <b>administrations,</b> {{including}} the transition team for Florida governor Jeb Bush in 1998. She also served as the National Co-Chair of the Hispanic Advisory Council for John McCain in 2008 and Jon Huntsman Jr. in 2012. She supported Jeb Bush's 2016 presidential campaign.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} the first ship to be completed, Dolphin, was ready for her final sea trials in early 1885, a new Democratic {{administration}} under Grover Cleveland had come to power. In spite of Dolphin passing her sea trials, the new administration, which suspected Roach of receiving favors from the previous <b>Republican</b> <b>administration,</b> found a pretext to declare the Dolphin contract void. Roach, by now a terminally ill old man, placed his company into receivership a short time later. He later explained that the voiding of the Dolphin contract {{made it impossible for}} him to secure a loan to continue his business since he still had another three Navy vessels on his slipways whose contracts might also be declared void.|$|E
25|$|In {{his second}} term, Webster found Miles Bearden, {{a leader of}} the {{fragmented}} House Federalists who had split following the failure of the secessionist-minded 1814 Hartford Convention, who he avoided. Speaker Henry Clay made Webster chairman of the Judiciary Committee in an attempt to win his and the Federalists' support. His term of service in the House between 1822 and 1828 was marked by his legislative success at reforming the United States criminal code, and his failure at expanding the size of the Supreme Court. He largely supported the National <b>Republican</b> <b>administration</b> of John Quincy Adams, including Adams' candidacy in the highly contested election of 1824 and the administration's defense of treaty-sanctioned Creek Indian land rights against Georgia's expansionist claims.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 10,000 largely {{peaceful}} protesters marched {{against the}} war in Iraq and 2,000 more to end homelessness and poverty. They represented a number of organizations opposed to the <b>Republican</b> <b>Administration</b> including the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign, Veterans for Peace, Iraq Veterans Against the War, Military Families Speak Out, the Teamsters, Code Pink, the American Indian Movement and the RNC Welcoming Committee. About 1,000 people in place for the third major march, and the last to be sanctioned, were stopped on Thursday, September 4, 2008, by police because they attempted to begin their march after the time their march permit expired. The Anti-War Committee, which supports nonviolent action and civil disobedience and had cooperated with anarchist groups, had organized and publicized the march to protest at the time of McCain's acceptance speech, which was in violation of the court-approved protest permit time.|$|E
5000|$|The song, whose lyrics {{argue that}} {{conspiracy}} theories about 9/11, such as George W. Bush and previous <b>Republican</b> <b>administrations</b> being {{largely responsible for}} the September 11, 2001 attacks, was received critically given its controversial chorus theme [...] "Bush knocked down the towers", sampled from the song [...] "Why?"
