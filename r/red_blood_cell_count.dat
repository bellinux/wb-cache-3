5|$|Most {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of AML are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. A lack of normal white blood cell production makes people more susceptible to infections; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors, they have no infection-fighting capacity. A drop in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> (anemia) can cause fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath. A lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} {{occurs in}} 1% of people following infections with Campylobacter species, and Guillain–Barré syndrome occurs in 0.1%. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may occur due to infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or Shigella species, causing low platelet counts, poor kidney function, and low <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> (due to their breakdown). Children are more predisposed to getting HUS than adults. Some viral infections may produce benign infantile seizures.|$|E

25|$|The <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> {{per unit}} volume in the ostrich is about 40% of {{that of a}} human; however, the red blood cells of the ostrich are about three {{times larger than the}} red blood cells of a human. The blood oxygen affinity, known as P50, is higher than that of both humans and similar avian species. The reason for this {{decreased}} oxygen affinity is due to the hemoglobin configuration found in common ostrich blood. The common ostrich’s tetramer is composed of hemoglobin type A and D, compared to typical mammalian tetramers composed of hemoglobin type A and B; hemoglobin D configuration causes a decreased oxygen affinity {{at the site of the}} respiratory surface.|$|E
25|$|The aging {{red blood}} cell {{undergoes}} changes in its plasma membrane, making it susceptible to selective recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocyte system (spleen, liver and lymph nodes), thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood. This process is termed eryptosis, {{red blood cell}} programmed cell death. This process normally occurs {{at the same rate}} of production by erythropoiesis, balancing the total circulating <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count.</b> Eryptosis is increased {{in a wide variety of}} diseases including sepsis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, malaria, sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, phosphate depletion, iron deficiency and Wilson's disease. Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock, oxidative stress, energy depletion as well as a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics. Excessive eryptosis is observed in red blood cells lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK. Inhibitors of eryptosis include erythropoietin, nitric oxide, catecholamines and high concentrations of urea.|$|E
500|$|Scully doubts [...] "Chapel's" [...] credibility, but Mulder {{believes}} his story {{due to his}} credentials and experience. Scully performs an autopsy on Weiss and finds that his blood has coagulated, while his <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> is excessively high. Scully finds an address on a bag recovered from Dickens' residence and heads there, discovering a lab {{that is in the}} process of being destroyed by [...] "Chapel."

50|$|A {{diagnosis}} of DBA is {{made on the}} basis of anemia, low reticulocyte (immature <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells)</b> <b>counts,</b> and diminished erythroid precursors in bone marrow.

2500|$|Blood—hematologic disorder—hemolytic anemia (low <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count),</b> {{leukopenia}} (white {{blood cell}} count<4000/µl), lymphopenia (<1500/µl), or low platelet count (<100000/µl) {{in the absence}} of offending drug; sensitivity = 59%; specificity = 89%. [...] Hypocomplementemia is also seen, due to either consumption of C3 and C4 by immune complex-induced inflammation or to congenitally complement deficiency, which may predispose to SLE.|$|E
2500|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} [...] (RA) is {{a long-term}} autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved {{on both sides of}} the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count,</b> inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months.|$|E
2500|$|Males {{typically}} have larger tracheae and branching bronchi, with about 30% greater lung volume per unit body mass. They have larger hearts, 10% higher <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count,</b> and higher hemoglobin, hence greater oxygen-carrying capacity. They also have higher circulating clotting factors (vitamin K, prothrombin and platelets). These differences lead to faster {{healing of wounds}} and higher peripheral pain tolerance. Females {{typically have}} more white blood cells (stored and circulating), more granulocytes and B and T lymphocytes. Additionally, they produce more antibodies {{at a faster rate}} than males. Hence they develop fewer infectious diseases and these continue for shorter periods. Ethologists argue that females, interacting with other females and multiple offspring in social groups, have experienced such traits as a selective advantage. According to Daly and Wilson, [...] "The sexes differ more in human beings than in monogamous mammals, but much less than in extremely polygamous mammals." [...] But given that sexual dimorphism in the closest relatives of humans is much greater than among humans, the human clade must be considered to be characterized by decreasing sexual dimorphism, probably due to less competitive mating patterns. One proposed explanation is that human sexuality has developed more in common with its close relative the bonobo, which exhibits similar sexual dimorphism, is polygynandrous and uses recreational sex to reinforce social bonds and reduce aggression.|$|E

5000|$|A low {{hematocrit}} {{level is}} a sign of a low <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count.</b> One way to increase the ability of oxygen transport in red blood cells is through blood transfusion, which is carried out typically when the <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> is low.

40|$|Biochemical and histopathological {{evaluations}} of the protective effects of the iron-chelator desferrioxamine against the cardiac and haematological toxicities of doxorubicin in normal rats were carried out. A single dose of doxorubicin (15 mg/kg, i. v.) caused myocardial damage that manifested biochemically as an elevation of serum cardiac enzyme [glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) ] and cardiac isoenzyme levels and histopathologically as a swelling and separation of cardiac muscle fibers. Doxorubicin caused severe leucopenia and decreases in <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> and haemoglobin concentrations at 72 h after its administration.
