Previous measurement technique of elastic constant has the limitation of application for thin film or polymer material because contact to specimen affects the result. Speckle pattern interferometry (SPI) has been developed as a noncontact optical measurement technique which can visualize resonance vibration mode shapes with whole-field. The maximum vibration amplitude at each vibration mode shape is a clue to find the resonance frequencies. The dynamic elastic constant of test material can be easily estimated from vibration of a beam equation using the measured resonance frequencies. The proposed technique is able to give high accurate elastic modulus of materials through a simple experiment set up and analysis. The result also compared to the theoretical result.

The flutter and resonance characteristics are placed in juxtaposition, and an attempt is made to correlate the tw~ sets of phenomena by means of the Kiissner criterion.

40|$|The {{vibration}} {{analysis is}} the study of the behaviour and dynamic properties of mechanical structures under actuation by harmonic vibration forces. The aim of <b>resonance</b> <b>tests</b> of the structures is the experimental delimitation of frequencies and the modes of resonance vibrations. Vibration analysis, or more precisely experimental vibration analysis, is the field of measuring and analyzing the dynamic response of mechanical structures when excited by a mechanical input. The broadly applied method of research relies on the harmonic actuation of vibrations and the measurement of respective parameters. Examples would include measuring the vibration of an aircraft load bearing structure when it is attached to an electromagnetic force actuator. Current vibration testing systems are composed of actuators set with their control and powering circuits, the vibration measurement transducers (typically accelerometers), an analog-to-digital converter to digitize analog instrumentation signals) and a system host computer to analyze the data and view it.
