5|$|J Duncan M Derrett, a {{professor}} of Oriental Laws, states that chapter 2.8 of the text discusses three kinds of constitutions and recommends that the king should delegate large responsibilities to their ministers, a system that implied that the kingdom was virtually ruled through the ministers. The Manasollasa gives a significant role to an astrologer in the council of advisors to the king who would forecast the auspicious time to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> attack, which Hartmut Scharfe, {{a professor}} of Indo-European Studies, states proved disastrous during Muslim and foreign invasion of the Deccan peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Air force experts raised {{questions}} and the Malaysian opposition leveled criticisms {{about the state of}} Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities. Many criticized the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace. The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation.|$|E

5|$|By December 1409 Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas {{had agreed}} on a common strategy: Their armies would unite into a single massive force and march {{together}} towards Marienburg (Malbork), capital of the Teutonic Knights. The Knights, who took a defensive position, did not expect a joint attack and were preparing for a dual invasion—by the Poles along the Vistula River towards Danzig (Gdańsk) and the Lithuanians along the Neman River towards Ragnit (Neman). To counter this perceived threat, Ulrich von Jungingen concentrated his forces in Schwetz (Świecie), a central location from where troops could <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> invasion from any direction rather quickly. Sizable garrisons were left in the eastern castles of Ragnit, Rhein (Ryn) near Lötzen (Giżycko), and Memel (Klaipėda). To keep their plans secret and mislead the knights, Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas organised several raids into border territories, thus forcing the knights to keep their troops in place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Puerto Cabezas, {{population}} 60,000, meteorologists expected a direct hit. Local authorities announced a curfew to prevent looting. The government also cut off electricity throughout the small coastal city to prevent injuries. Evacuations were limited, and the most vulnerable of the population weathered the storm in poorly constructed shelters. To be able to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> emergency following Beta, the government of Nicaragua requested relief supplies for 41,866 families which would last 15 days. These supplies consisted of 98,000lb (44,452kg) of cereals, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of beans, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of corn, 125,7200lb (57,025kg) of rice, 44,500lb (20,184kg) of sugar, 171,600lb (77,836kg) of salt, 4,929gal (18,658L) of cooking oil, 324,900lb (147,372kg) of milk and 21,264 blankets.|$|E
5|$|Like other volcanoes in the NCVP, Level Mountain is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the GSC to ascertain how active its magma system is. The Canadian National Seismograph Network {{has been established}} to monitor earthquakes throughout Canada, {{but it is too}} far away to provide an accurate indication of activity under the mountain. It may sense an increase in seismic activity if Level Mountain becomes highly restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption; the system might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting. If Level Mountain were to erupt, mechanisms exist to orchestrate relief efforts. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan was created to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> erupting volcano in Canada, an eruption close to the Canada–United States border or any eruption that would affect Canada.|$|E

5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E
5|$|Ventidius Cumanus (fl. 1st century AD) was the Roman procurator of Iudaea Province from AD 48 to c. AD 52. A {{disagreement}} between the surviving sources, the Jewish historian Josephus and the Roman Tacitus, makes it unclear whether his authority was over {{some or all}} of the province. Cumanus' time in office was marked by disputes between his troops and the Jewish population. Ventidius Cumanus failed to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> anti-Jewish murder in Samaritan territory which led to the violent conflict between Jews and Samaritans. Following an investigation by the governor of Syria, Gaius Ummidius Durmius Quadratus, Cumanus was sent to Rome for a hearing before the Emperor Claudius, who held him responsible for the violence and sentenced him to exile.|$|E
5|$|Like other volcanoes in the Anahim Volcanic Belt, the Itcha Range is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma system is.

5|$|The film {{presents}} {{examples of}} crowd psychology and collective behavior {{which can lead}} to mass hysteria and the loss of social order. The bafflement, outrage, and helplessness associated with the lack of information, combined with new media such as blogs, allow conspiracy theorists like Krumwiede to spread disinformation and fear, which become dangerous contagions themselves. Dr. Cheever must balance the need for full disclosure but avoid a panic and allow the time to characterize and <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unknown virus. The movie indirectly critiques the greed, selfishness, and hypocrisy of isolated acts in contemporary culture and the unintended consequences they can have {{in the context of a}} pandemic. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends social distancing by forcibly isolating the healthy to limit the spread of the disease, which stands in stark opposition to contemporary demands for social networking. Responding to the pandemic presents a paradox, as the contagiousness and lethality of the virus instills deep distrust of others but surviving and limiting the spread of the disease also requires individuals to work together.|$|E

25|$|Normal {{platelets}} can <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> abnormality on {{the vessel}} wall {{rather than to}} hemorrhage, resulting in inappropriate platelet adhesion/activation and thrombosis: {{the formation of a}} clot within an intact vessel. This type of thrombosis arises by mechanisms different than those of a normal clot: namely, extending the fibrin clot of venous thrombosis; extending an unstable or ruptured arterial plaque, causing arterial thrombosis; and microcirculatory thrombosis. An arterial thrombus may partially obstruct blood flow, causing downstream ischemia, or may completely obstruct it, causing downstream tissue death.|$|E

However, the more antidepressants an individual had already tried, the less likely they were to benefit from a new antidepressant trial.
