The experiment was performed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) using the 100  TW Callisto laser of the Jupiter Laser Facility (JLF). Thin metal foils (Au, Cu, and Al) with thicknesses ranging from 10 to 20 [*][*]μm were irradiated by a variable number of low intensity (∼ 10 ^{ 12 }[*][*]W/cm^{ 2 }) laser pulses, the last one arriving 100  ms before the main pulse.

A lot of new information concerning possibilities of their subsequent removal from the living environment is published every year. A very important step for an application of new methods as functional technologies is their pilot scale testing or other verification under service conditions.

This is of particular concern if the residue might contain prions. We investigated {{at the molecular level}} the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> model and real-life proteinaceous contamination from model and practical surfaces by air plasma (ionised air) treatment. The surface-sensitive technique of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to assess the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> proteinaceous <b>contamination,</b> with the nitrogen (N 1 s) photoelectron signal as its marker. Model proteinaceous contamination (bovine serum albumin) adsorbed on to a model surface (silicon wafer) and the residual proteinaceous contamination resulting from incubating surgical stainless steel (a practical biomaterial) in whole human blood exhibited strong N 1 s signals [16. 8 and 18. 5 atomic percent (at. %), respectively] after thorough washing. After 5 min air plasma treatment, XPS detected no nitrogen on the sample surfaces, indicating complete <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> proteinaceous <b>contamination,</b> down to the estimated XPS detection limit 10 ng/cm 2. Applying the same plasma treatment, the 7. 7 at. % nitrogen observed on a clinically cleaned dental bur was reduced to a level reflective of new, as-received burs.

This study demonstrates the effectiveness of air plasma treatment for removing proteinaceous contamination from both model and practical surfaces and offers a method for ensuring that no molecular residual contamination such as prions is transferred upon re-use of surgical and dental instruments. ...|$|R

40|$|From {{the early}} days of {{radiocarbon}} dating, the standard sample treatment has involved <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> from carbonates and humic acids by washes in acid and base, respectively. A modification of this acid-base-acid (ABA) method has been suggested, especially for material older than 20, 000 yr. However, the criticism of ABA and application of a more aggressive oxidizing method, such as wet oxidation (ABOX) or cellulose extraction, might only be needed in some special cases, for example, in the case of poorly preserved or chemically treated wood. Separation of cellulose seems to be the ultimate solution; however, it is not always applicable when samples contain small amounts of wood. As a part of studies focusing on the chronology of late Pleistocene sedimentary processes in the Venetian–Friulian Plain and Carnic Alps (NE Italy), 14 C analyses were performed on old wood samples found in sedimentary deposits of pre-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) age. Wood samples were treated by five methods: ABA, two modified ABA treatments (ABOX and ABA+Bleach), as well as two different cellulose separations. Infrared spectra of treated samples and 14 C results show that in most cases the ABA method is sufficient in removing the contamination of naturally deposited wood, even when the wood is of very old age...|$|E

40|$|A major {{mission of}} the US Department of Energy during the 1990 s is site and {{environmental}} cleanup. In pursuit of this mission, numerous remediation projects are under way and many others are being planned at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). In this report, tests using two proposed methods for decontaminating surfaces one using water ice crystals [Crystalline Ice Blast (CIB) ], the other using dry ice crystals (CO{sub 2 } Cleanblast{trademark}) [...] are described. Both methods are adaptations of the commonly used sand blasting technology. The two methods tested differ from sand blasting in that the particles are not particularly abrasive and do not accumulate as particles in the wastes. They differ {{from each other in}} that the CO{sub 2 } particles sublime during and after impact and the ice particles melt. Thus, the two demonstrations provide important information about two strong candidate decontamination methodologies. Each process was tested at ORNL using contaminated lead bricks and contaminated tools and equipment. Demonstrations with the prototype Crystalline Ice Blast and the CO{sub 2 } Cleanblast systems showed that paint, grease, and oil can be removed from metal, plastic, asphalt, and concrete surfaces. Furthermore, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> from lead bricks was highly effective. Both processes were found to be less effective, under the conditions tested, with contaminated tools and equipment that had chemically bonded contamination or contamination located in crevices since neither technology abrades the substrates or penetrates deeply into crevices to remove particulates.

40|$|Background and Aim: The {{efficiency}} of disinfecting materials and procedures in <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> from dental surfaces and equipments is essential. In authors' previous study, daily use of 2 : 100 dilution of 5 % sodium hypochlorite {{in water and}} disposable covers were recommended since HBV contamination was found on semi-critical parts of the operative dentistry department. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the HBV contamination following application of the recommended procedures. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in two parts. In the first cross-sectional part, samples were collected from 17 sites of dental surfaces. In the second interventional part samples were collected from 10 sites of 9 dental and 3 sites of 2 light cure units, before and after disinfection with 5 % sodium hypochlorite solution diluted to 2 : 100. Sterile cotton swabs moistened with sterile BSAS (Bovine Serum Albumin in Sodium Chloride) solution were used for sampling. Samples were tested by PCR technique in Pasteur Institute, Iran. Results: None of the samples collected in the first part of the study showed contamination. In the second part of the study, from 96 samples taken from various parts of dental and light cure units, before and after disinfection, there was only one HBV contaminated site before disinfection which showed no contamination after disinfection.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of {{nonionic}} surfactant on <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> and also investigates {{the impact of}} surfactant temperature on slider bar corrosion. The experiments were carried out for various ultrasonic frequencies, sonication time, sonication power and surfactant temperatures. Different parts of corrosion suspect parts were analysed to identify the corrosion by using nano scanning electron microscope SEM technique. Potentiostat tests were carried out to identify the corrosion potential for different surfactant temperatures. From experimental results, it can be observed that the corrosion rate was slightly higher for 60 οC surfactant temperature as compared to 25 οC. The results indicates that the removal efficiency of glue contamination and other particulate contamination improved from 67 % (Surfactant temperature 25 οC) to 85 % (Surfactant temp 55 οC) but when the temperature was over 55 οC the removal rate was decreased. This {{is due to the}} fact that at temperature around 50 - 55 οC the solubility of surfactant in water is higher and therefore the surfactant becomes more active. At higher temperature (more than 55 οC) the solubility of surfactant in water is poor. The surfactant seperates out from water and the liquid becomes cloudy. When the surfactant temperature exceeds the cloud point, the effect of surfactant is lowered. From data it can also be seen that 2 % surfactant concentration gives higher removal efficiency as compared to other concentration levels. From SEM analysis, no slider bar corrosion was found for both 25 and 60 οC surfactant temperature. The optimum sonication time and ultrasonic power obtained was 3 min and 250 W respectively...|$|E
