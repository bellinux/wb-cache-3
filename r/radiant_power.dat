60|$|The {{question}} is probably considered too simply--too {{much to the}} neglect of concurrent influences. Until we know, for example, somewhat more of the comparative <b>radiant</b> <b>powers</b> of different soils, we cannot expect any very definite result. A change of temperature would certainly be effected by the plantation of such a marshy district as the Sologne, because, if nothing else were done, the roots might pierce the impenetrable subsoil, allow the surface-water to drain itself off, and thus dry the country. But might not the change be quite different if the soil planted were a shifting sand, which, fixed by the roots of the trees, would become gradually covered with a vegetable earth, and be thus changed from dry to wet? Again, the complication and conflict of effects arises, not only from the soil, vegetation, and geographical position of the place of the experiment itself, but from the distribution of similar or different conditions in its immediate neighbourhood, and probably to great distances on every side. A forest, for example, as we know from Herr Rivoli's comparison, would exercise a perfectly different influence in a cold country subject to warm winds, and in a warm country subject to cold winds; so that our question might meet with different solutions even on the east and west coasts of Great Britain.|$|R

Emissivity is {{the ratio}} between the <b>radiant</b> {{hemispherical}} <b>power</b> emitted by a real body, at an absolute temperature, and the <b>radiant</b> hemispherical <b>power</b> emitted {{by a black}} body at the same temperature. The energy emitted {{is proportional to the}} fourth power of the object´s temperature. Emissivity may vary from 0 (reflected by a mirror) to 1. 0 (black body theory). Studies are being carried out at the University of Brasilia to investigate the microstructural behavior of materials used in the repairing of hydroelectric turbines, after several thermal cycles of welding. These studies use thermographic techniques for monitoring the temperature and require that the correct emissivity value for specific materials and surface conditions are used in order to guaranty that the temperatures reported by the radiometric sensors are consistent with the actual temperatures. This study aims to validate an experimental methodology for evaluating the emissivity of the steel ASTM A 743 CA 6 NM and the AWS 410 NiMo as deposited by a GMAW process at temperatures ranging from 100 ºC to 1000 ºC. The experiment consists of heating a small sample of the material with an oxyacetylene torch while a thermocouple, welded on surface of the sample, an infrared sensor and a thermographic camera monitor the surface temperature. During the heating and the cooling process, the sample surface is protected from the air by an argon gas flow directed towards the visualized area. Results consistent with the reported in the literature for similar materials were attained and curves of the emissivity “versus ” temperature for the tested materials were produced, providing a basis for proper thermographic temperature monitoring...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{applicability of}} antifungal treatments, the {{limited range of}} available drug classes {{and the emergence of}} drug resistance in Candida spp. suggest the need for new treatment options. To explore the applicability of C. albicans photoinactivation, we examined nine structurally different imidazoacridinone derivatives as photosensitizing agents. The most effective derivatives showed a > 10 (4) -fold reduction of viable cell numbers. The fungicidal action of the three most active compounds was compared at different <b>radiant</b> <b>powers</b> (3. 5 to 63 mW/cm 2), and this analysis indicated that 7 mW/cm 2 was the most efficient. The intracellular accumulation of these compounds in fungal cells correlated with the fungicidal activity of all 9 derivatives. The lack of effect of verapamil, an inhibitor targeting Candida ABC efflux pumps, suggests that these imidazoacridinones are not substrates for ABC transporters. Thus, unlike azoles, a major class of antifungals used against Candida, ABC transporter-mediated resistance is unlikely. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) -spin trapping data suggested that the fungicidal light-induced action of these derivatives might depend on the production of superoxide anion. The highest generation rate of superoxide anion was observed for 1330 H, 1610 H, and 1611. Singlet oxygen production was also detected upon the irradiation of imidazoacridinone derivatives with UV laser light, with a low to moderate yield, {{depending on the type of}} compound. Thus, imidazoacridinone derivatives examined in the present study might act via mixed type I/type II photodynamic mechanism. The presented data indicate lack of direct correlation between the structures of studied imidazoacridinones, cell killing ability, and ROS production. However, we showed for the first time that for imidazoacridinones not only intracellular accumulation is necessary prerequisite of lethal photosensitization of C. albicans, but also localization within particular cellular structures. Our findings present IA derivatives as efficient antifungal photosensitizers with a potential to be used in local treatment of Candida infection...|$|R

40|$|Complementary colours {{have been}} {{researched}} for 340 years but {{little is known}} of their role in colour vision. Complementary colours are defined {{as a pair of}} colour stimuli which admix a given white (i. e. cancel all hue). This chapter aims to describe recent research of the roles of complementary colours in colour vision. Presently, only one role for complementary colours is accepted in the scientific literature: a colorimetric role in colour mixture. A second role, in chromatic induction, was generally accepted until (erroneously) usurped 50 years ago by the opponent colours theory of chromatic induction. The visual system develops many functions from complementary colours (whose physiological basis is color-opponent cells in retina and cortex.) For a start, two of the cones (S and L, peaks about 445 and 568 nm) are complementary. The third cone (M, peak about 530 nm) complements the nonspectral hues. This chapter shows complementarism structures ten visual functions. First, complementary colours are shown to form hue cycle structure. Second, a relative wavelength scale is derived from dominant and complementary wavelengths, extended into nonspectral hues to form an overarching wavelength-based metric over the;whole hue cycle. Third, complementary wavelengths are shown to structure a colour constancy mechanism where constant hues and complementary constant hues form, remarkably, parallel straight lines (related by invariant wavelength ratios) in the plane of wavelength and reciprocal ilIuminant colour temperature. The relative wavelength scale is used to extend this grid-like mechanism into the nonspectrals. A key paper establishes a further seven roles, six by formulating math models for wavelength discrimination, u. mform hue, spectral sensitivity, saturation, chromatic adaptation, chromatic induction, from tbe ratio of either complementary wavelength intervals or complementary <b>radiant</b> <b>powers.</b> Complementary colours' II varied roles (including the colorimetric role) extend over the visual process from cones to cortex. These discrete roles have an overall structural role, in shaping functions to a trimodal framework (ROB peaks, complementary CMY troughs) which facilitates adapting functions to the illuminant. Thus the general role is evidently chromatic adaptation, for the purpose of colour constancy and improved image recognition in different iIIuminants. Given the role of complementary colours in colour constancy and hue discrimination, they may prove to be central to the visual process. 44 pages(s...|$|R
