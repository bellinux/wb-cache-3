40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{evolution}} of viscous and radiative circumstellar disks {{under the influence of}} a companion star. We focus on the eccentric γ Cephei and α Centauri system as examples and compare the disk quantities such as disk eccentricity and precession rate to previous isothermal simulations. We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the binary star systems under the assumption of coplanarity of the disk, host star and binary companion. We use the grid-based, staggered mesh code FARGO with an additional energy equation to which we added radiative cooling based on opacity tables. The eccentric binary companion perturbs the disk around the primary star periodically. Upon passing periastron spirals arms are induced that wind from the outer disk towards the star. In isothermal simulations this results in disk eccentricities up to ϵ_disk 0. 2, but in more realistic radiative models we obtain much smaller eccentricities of about ϵ_disk 0. 04 - 0. 06 with no <b>real</b> <b>precession.</b> Models with varying viscosity and disk mass indicate show that disks with less mass have lower temperatures and higher disk eccentricity. The rather large high disk eccentricities, as indicated in previous isothermal disk simulations, implied a more difficult planet formation in the γ Cephei system due to the enhanced collision velocities of planetesimals. We have shown that under more realistic conditions with radiative cooling the disk become less eccentric and thus planet formation may be made easier. However, we estimate that the viscosity in the disk has to very small, with α≲ 0. 001, because otherwise the disk's lifetime will be too short to allow planet formation to occur along the core instability scenario. We estimate that the periodic heating of the disk in eccentric binaries will be observable in the mid-IR regime. Comment: 12 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|E
