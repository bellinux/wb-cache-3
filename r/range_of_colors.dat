Hydnellum packii produces gray, brown, and olive colors. Hydnuferrugin and hydnuferruginin are pigments responsible for the coloration of H. ferrugineum and H. zonatum. Geogenin is a yellow pigment found in H. geogenium.|$|E
5|$|The new camera {{will allow}} Hubble to take large-scale, {{extremely}} clear and detailed photos over a wider <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> {{than the old}} camera did. After the installation, controllers at the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center sent commands to the camera to perform an aliveness test, which passed, indicating the camera was installed correctly.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these and}} {{numerous}} other influences, however, Shelly Manne's style of drumming was always his ownpersonal, precise, clear, {{and at the same}} time multilayered, using a very broad <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors.</b> Manne was often experimental, and had participated in such musically exploratory groups of the early 1950s as those of Jimmy Giuffre and Teddy Charles. Yet his playing never became overly cerebral, and he never neglected that element usually considered fundamental to all jazz: time.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians could {{fabricate}} a {{wide variety}} of objects from glass with great skill, {{but it is not clear}} whether they developed the process independently. It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.|$|E
5|$|Very rarely (about 1 in 10,000 conchs), a conch pearl may {{be found}} within the mantle. Though they occur in a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> {{corresponding}} to {{the colors of the}} interior of the shell, pink specimens are the most valuable. These pearls are considered semi-precious, and a popular tourist curio. The best specimens have been used to create necklaces and earrings. A conch pearl is a non-nacreous pearl (formerly referred to by some sources as a 'calcareous concretion') which differs from most pearls that are sold as gemstones.|$|E
5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for a wider <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors,</b> as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E

50|$|Nembrotha chamberlaini {{is easily}} {{confused}} with Nembrotha aurea and Nembrotha purpureolineata. All three species {{have a similar}} <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> variation although N. aurea often has orange patches not present in Nembrotha chamberlaini.|$|R
5|$|Tornadoes {{can have}} a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors,</b> {{depending}} on {{the environment in which}} they form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris {{at the base of the}} funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{detailed}} analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers were only able to determine the most basic facts about their makeup, primarily their color. These first data showed a broad <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> among KBOs, ranging from neutral grey to deep red. This suggested that their surfaces were composed {{of a wide range}} of compounds, from dirty ices to hydrocarbons. This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of the volatile ices from their surfaces to the effects of cosmic rays. Various solutions were suggested for this discrepancy, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing. Jewitt and Luu's spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in color was too extreme to be easily explained by random impacts. The radiation from the Sun is thought to have chemically altered methane on the surface of KBOs, producing products such as tholins. Makemake has been shown to possess a number of hydrocarbons derived from the radiation-processing of methane, including ethane, ethylene and acetylene.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the composition, techniques, layout, and style of Delian mosaics {{can be found in}} 5th-century BC pebble mosaics of Olynthus in the Chalcidice of {{northern}} Greece, with mosaics positioned in the center of cement floors and utilizing garland, meander, and wave patterns around a centralized motif or figured scene. This design scheme {{is similar to that of}} 4th-century BC mosaics of Pella in Macedonia, although the pebble mosaics there employ a wider <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> to create the effects of volume. The transition from pebble mosaics to more complex tessellated mosaics perhaps originated in Hellenistic-Greek Sicily during the 3rd century BC, developed at sites such as Morgantina and Syracuse. Much like Olynthus, mosaics of Morgantina contain the garland, wave, and meander patterns, although the latter was finally executed with perspective.|$|E

25|$|Diamond {{color is}} graded by {{comparing}} a sample stone to a master stone set of diamonds. Each master stone {{is known to}} exhibit the very least amount <b>of</b> body <b>color</b> that a diamond in that color grade may exhibit. A trained diamond grader compares a diamond of unknown grade against the series of master stones, assessing where in the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> the diamond resides. This process occurs in a lighting box, fitted with daylight equivalent lamps. Accurate color grading can only be performed with diamond unset, as the comparison with master stones is done with diamond placed on its table facet and pavilion side facing upwards. When color grading {{is done in the}} mounting, the grade is expressed as an estimated color grade and commonly as a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> Grading mounted diamonds involves holding the mounted diamonds table close to the table facet of the master stone and visually comparing the diamond color under the same color conditions as unmounted diamond grading. The resulting grade is typically less accurate, and is therefore expressed as a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> While a grading laboratory will possess a complete set of master stones representing every color grade, the independent grader working in a retail environment works with a smaller subset of master stones that covers only the typical grade <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> they expect to encounter while grading. A common subset of master stones would consist of five diamonds in two grade increments, such as an E, G, I, K, and M. The intermediate grades are assessed by the graders judgement.|$|R

5|$|Diamond is the allotrope {{of carbon}} {{in which the}} carbon atoms are {{arranged}} in the specific type of cubic lattice called diamond cubic. Diamond is an optically isotropic crystal that is transparent to opaque. Diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Yet, due to important structural weaknesses, diamond's toughness is only fair to good. The precise tensile strength of diamond is unknown, however strength up to 60GPa has been observed, {{and it could be}} as high as 90–225GPa depending on the crystal orientation. The anisotropy of diamond hardness is carefully considered during diamond cutting. Diamond has a high refractive index (2.417) and moderate dispersion (0.044) properties which give cut diamonds their brilliance. Scientists classify diamonds into four main types according to the nature of crystallographic defects present. Trace impurities substitutionally replacing carbon atoms in a diamond's crystal structure, and in some cases structural defects, are responsible for the wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> seen in diamond. Most diamonds are electrical insulators but extremely efficient thermal conductors. Unlike many other minerals, the specific gravity of diamond crystals (3.52) has rather small variation from diamond to diamond.|$|E

50|$|The wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> donors {{makes it}} {{possible}} to simulate accurately process, corporate, brand, spot and special colors. Process donors include cyan, magenta, yellow and black. Additional donors, orange, green and blue, extend the color gamut. There are 2 opaque donors: white and metallic. The metallic donor combined with the other color donors allows for the creation <b>of</b> a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> metallic <b>colors</b> such as gold, copper, bronze, etc. This produces special effects not possible via inkjet printers but commonly used in today’s packaging.|$|R
50|$|Models in {{this line}} were the 'Heritage', 'Heritage-Deluxe', and later the 'Heritage III'. In each case, the basic design {{was the same as}} the Futura’s.

25|$|These are compact bodies (solid sticks/rods) with shades {{ranging from}} light blue to dark purple. The <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> {{is due to}} varying {{proportions}} of Han blue, Han purple, and colorless material.

They may have been of importance themselves, as ceremonial or bureaucratic items of importance.|$|E
25|$|The word {{peridotite}} {{comes from}} the gemstone peridot, which consists of pale green olivine. Classic peridotite is bright green with some specks of black, although most hand samples tend to be darker green. Peridotitic outcrops typically range from earthy bright yellow to dark green in color; this is because olivine is easily weathered to iddingsite. While green and yellow {{are the most common}} colors, peridotitic rocks may exhibit a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> such as blue, brown, and red.|$|E
50|$|An early {{application}} of exposure compensation was the Zone System developed by Ansel Adams and Fred Archer. Although the Zone System {{has sometimes been}} regarded as complex, the basic concept is quite simple: render dark objects as dark and light objects as light, according to the photographer's visualization. Developed for black-and-white film, the Zone System divided luminance into 11 zones, with Zone 0 representing pure black and Zone X representing pure white. The meter indication would place whatever was metered on Zone V, a medium gray. The tonal <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> negative film is slightly {{less than that of}} black-and-white film, and the tonal <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> reversal film and digital sensors even less; accordingly, there are fewer zones between pure black and pure white. The meter indication, however, remains Zone V.|$|R
