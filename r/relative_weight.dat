5|$|The first {{remarkable}} historiographical {{school of}} {{interpretation of the}} history of Argentina was founded by members of the 1837 generation, including Bartolom√© Mitre. Mitre regarded the May Revolution as an iconic expression of political egalitarianism: a conflict between modern freedoms and oppression represented by the Spanish monarchy, and an attempt to establish a national organization on constitutional principles as opposed to the charismatic authority of the caudillos. These authors' views were treated as canonical {{until the end of the}} 19thcentury, when the proximity of the centennial encouraged authors to seek new perspectives. The newer authors would differ about the <b>relative</b> <b>weight</b> of the causes of the May Revolution and about whose intervention in the events was more decisive, but the main views expressed by Mitre were kept, such as to consider the revolution to be the birth of modern Argentina and an unavoidable event. These authors introduced the idea of popular intervention as another key element. By the time of the World Wars, liberal authors attempted to impose an ultimate and unquestionable historical perspective; Ricardo Levene and the Academia Nacional de la Historia were exponents of this tendency, which still kept most perspectives of Mitre. Left-wing authors took a revisionist view based on nationalism and anti-imperialism; they minimized the dispute between criollos and peninsulars and portrayed events as a dispute between enlightenment and absolutism. However, most of their work was focused on other historical periods.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: I use an {{experiment}} {{to examine how}} accurate versus inaccurate <b>relative</b> incentive <b>weights</b> on multiple measures that lead bottom-line financial results (i. e., lead measures) affects managerial performance. The experiment has three types of incentive contracts which reward different combinations of performance measures: only a lag financial measure (ONLYLAG), two lead measures and a lag financial measure (LEADLAG), or only two lead measures (ONLYLEAD). I find that adding lead measures to an incentive contract with only a lag measure (LEADLAG versus ONLYLAG) increases performance when the two lead measures have accurate <b>relative</b> <b>weights,</b> but does not decrease nor increase performance when the two lead measures have inaccurate <b>relative</b> <b>weights.</b> Hence, the addition of lead measures at best benefits performance when the <b>relative</b> <b>weights</b> on lead measures are accurate, and at worst does not harm performance when the <b>relative</b> <b>weights</b> on lead measures are inaccurate. I also find that removing the lag measure from the incentive contract (ONLYLEAD versus LEADLAG) increases performance when the two lead measures have accurate <b>relative</b> <b>weights,</b> but decreases performance when the two lead measures have inaccurate <b>relative</b> <b>weights.</b> The {{results suggest that the}} dysfunctional effect of having lead measures with inaccurate <b>relative</b> <b>weights</b> i...|$|R

500|$|According to a 2011 {{article in}} Investments & Pensions Europe, the risk parity {{approach}} has [...] "moderate risks" [...] which include: [...] communicating its value to boards of directors; [...] unforeseen {{events like the}} 2008 market decline; market timing risks associated with implementation; the use of leverage and derivatives and basis risks associated with derivatives. Other critics warn {{that the use of}} leverage and relying heavily on fixed income assets may create its own risk. Portfolio manager Ben Inker has criticized risk parity for being a benchmarking approach that gives too much <b>relative</b> <b>weight</b> to bonds when compared to other alternative portfolio approaches. However, proponents of risk parity say that its purpose is to avoid predicting future returns. Inker also says that risk parity requires too much leverage to produce the same expected returns as conventional alternatives. Proponents answer that the reduced risk from additional diversification more than offsets the additional leverage risk and that leverage through publicly traded futures and prime brokerage financing of assets also means a high percentage of cash in the portfolio to cover losses and margin calls. Additionally Inker says that bonds have negative skew, (small probability of large losses and large probability of small gains) which makes them a dangerous investment to leverage. Proponents have countered by saying that their approach calls for reduced exposure to bonds as volatility increases and provides less skew than conventional portfolios.|$|E

Will this <b>relative</b> <b>weighting</b> be the same for one given self as it is for a different given self? If it is, then we have a case of time consistency.

If there exists a case of one <b>relative</b> <b>weighting</b> of utilities where one self has a different <b>relative</b> <b>weighting</b> of those utilities than another self has, then we have a case of time inconsistency and the decision-maker will be said to have time-inconsistent preferences.|$|R
60|$|Of {{the flowers}} which were crossed {{in the three}} generations, taken together, a rather larger {{proportion}} yielded capsules than did those which were self-fertilised. The seeds were counted in forty-seven capsules from the crossed flowers, and they contained on an average 9.95 seeds; whereas forty-eight capsules from the self-fertilised flowers contained on an average 8.45 seeds; or as 100 to 85. The seeds from the crossed flowers were not heavier, on the contrary a little lighter, than those from the self-fertilised flowers, as was thrice ascertained. On one occasion I weighed 200 of the crossed and 106 of the self-fertilised seeds, and the <b>relative</b> <b>weight</b> of an equal number was as 100 for the crossed to 101.5 for the self-fertilised. With other plants, when the seeds from the self-fertilised flowers were heavier than those from the crossed flowers, this appeared to be due generally to fewer having been produced by the self-fertilised flowers, and to their having been in consequence better nourished. But in the present instance the seeds from the crossed capsules were separated into two lots,--namely, those from the capsules containing over fourteen seeds, and those from the capsules containing under fourteen seeds, and the seeds from the more productive capsules were the heavier of the two; so that the above explanation here fails.|$|E
60|$|In the Indian Frizzled fowl, which cannot fly, the {{reduction}} is {{carried to the}} greatest extent, namely, to thirty-three per cent of their proper proportional weight. In the next four birds, including the Silk hen, which is incapable of flight, {{we see that the}} wings, relatively to the legs, are slightly increased in weight; but it should be observed that, if in these birds the legs had become from any cause reduced in weight, this would give the false appearance of the wings having increased in <b>relative</b> <b>weight.</b> Now a reduction of this nature has certainly occurred with the Burmese Jumper, in which the legs are abnormally short, and in the two Hamburghs and Silk fowl, the legs, though not short, are formed of remarkably thin and light bones. I make these statements, not judging by mere eyesight, but after having calculated the weights of the leg-bones relatively to those of G. bankiva, according to the only two standards of comparison which I could use, namely, the relative lengths of the head and sternum; for I do not know the weight of the body in G. bankiva, which would have been a better standard. According to these standards, the leg-bones in these four fowls are in a marked manner far lighter than in any other breed. It may therefore be concluded that in all cases in which the legs have not been through some unknown cause much reduced in weight, the wing-bones have become reduced in weight relatively to the leg-bones, in comparison with those of G. bankiva. And this reduction of weight may, I apprehend, safely be attributed to disuse.|$|E
60|$|With {{respect to}} the {{relative}} period of germination of crossed and self-fertilised seeds, a record was kept in only twenty-one cases; {{and the results are}} very perplexing. Neglecting one case in which the two lots germinated simultaneously, in ten cases or exactly one-half many of the self-fertilised seeds germinated before the crossed, and in the other half many of the crossed before the self-fertilised. In four out of these twenty cases, seeds derived from a cross with a fresh stock were compared with self-fertilised seeds from one of the later self-fertilised generations; and here again in half the cases the crossed seeds, and in the other half the self-fertilised seeds, germinated first. Yet the seedlings of Mimulus raised from such self-fertilised seeds were inferior in all respects to the crossed seedlings, {{and in the case of}} Eschscholtzia they were inferior in fertility. Unfortunately the <b>relative</b> <b>weight</b> of the two lots of seeds was ascertained in only a few instances in which their germination was observed; but with Ipomoea and I believe with some of the other species, the relative lightness of the self-fertilised seeds apparently determined their early germination, probably owing to the smaller mass being favourable to the more rapid completion of the chemical and morphological changes necessary for germination. On the other hand, Mr. Galton gave me seeds (no doubt all self-fertilised) of Lathyrus odoratus, which were divided into two lots of heavier and lighter seeds; and several of the former germinated first. It is evident that many more observations are necessary before anything can be decided with {{respect to the}} relative period of germination of crossed and self-fertilised seeds.|$|E
