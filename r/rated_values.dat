40|$|Abstract. The present article {{deals with}} {{calculation}} of the <b>rated</b> <b>values</b> of noise characteristics (RVNC) of UKM vegetable kitchen cutter. There are given results of experimental researches of noise characteristics (NC) of the UKM vegetable cutter within the sound power levels (SPL) in octave frequency bands in the load-free and on-load operation with a product. There have been also determined their correlation to the <b>rated</b> <b>values</b> of noise characteristics. The study {{results show that the}} sound power level emitted by the UKM cutter according to the A characteristic exceeds the RVNC at operation of the cutter with a product. The frequency of 500 Hz usually is “dangerous ” in the octave frequency bands; excess of the RVNC is 11 dB. Operation of the cutter at a higher rotation rate worsens its noise characteristics. Gears of the drive, {{as well as of the}} changeable vegetable cutting mechanism are the source of the increased noise level...|$|E
