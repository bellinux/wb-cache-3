40|$|Abstract — Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{are becoming increasingly}} important in recent years due {{to their ability to}} detect and convey real-time in-situ scenes for many civil and military applications. A major technical challenge for a wireless sensor network lies in the energy constraint at each node, which poses a fundamental limit on the network lifetime. We consider two-tiered wireless sensor networks and address the network lifetime problem for upper-tier aggregation and forwarding nodes (AFNs). Prior efforts have formulated the network lifetime problem into a linear programming (LP) that results in a multi-session flow <b>routing</b> <b>solution.</b> Under multi-session flow routing, each AFN must be equipped with multiple transmitter to reach various destinations at the same time, which poses a scalability problem in practice. This paper shows that, by exploiting dynamic power control at an AFN’s transmitter, a multi-session flow <b>routing</b> <b>solution</b> can be converted into an equivalent single-session flow <b>routing</b> <b>solution</b> (requiring only a single transmitter at each AFN). Consequently, it shows {{that it is possible to}} design a single-session flow <b>routing</b> <b>solution</b> that has the same optimal network lifetime as a multi-session flow <b>routing</b> <b>solution.</b> Index Terms — Network lifetime, energy constraint, flow routing, power control, wireless sensor networks.

In this paper, we address the problem of routing multi-terminal nets in a multi-FPGA system that uses partial crossbars as interconnect structures. First, we model the multi-terminal routing problem as a partitioned bin packing problem and formulate it as an integer linear programming problem where the number of variables is exponential. A fast heuristic is applied to compute an upper bound on the <b>routing</b> <b>solution.</b> Then, a column generation technique is used to solve the linear relaxation of the initial master problem in order to obtain a lower bound on the <b>routing</b> <b>solution.</b> This is followed by an iterative branch-and-price procedure that attempts to find a <b>routing</b> <b>solution</b> somewhere between the two established bounds. In this regard, the proposed algorithm guarantees an exact <b>routing</b> <b>solution</b> by searching a branch-and-price tree. Due to the tightness of the bounds, the branch-and-price tree is small resulting in shorter execution times. Experimental results are provided for different netlists and board configurations in order to demonstrate the algorithm’s performance.

40|$|The {{objective}} of unicast routing {{is to find}} a path from a source to a destination. Conventional routing has been used mainly to provide connectivity. It lacks the ability to provide any kind of service guarantees and smart usage of network resources. Improving performance is possible by being aware of both traffic characteristics and current available resources. This paper surveys a range of <b>routing</b> <b>solutions,</b> which can be categorized depending on the degree of the awareness of the algorithm: (1) QoS/Constraint-based <b>routing</b> <b>solutions</b> are aware of traffic requirements of individual connection requests; (2) Traffic-aware <b>routing</b> <b>solutions</b> assume knowledge of the location of communicating ingress-egress pairs and possibly the traffic demands among them; (3) <b>Routing</b> <b>solutions</b> that are both QoS-aware as (1) and traffic-aware as (2); (4) Best-effort solutions are oblivious to both traffic and QoS requirements, but are adaptive only to current resource availability. The best performance can be achieved by having all possible knowledge so that while finding a path for an individual ﬂow, one can make a smart choice among feasible paths to increase the chances of supporting future requests. However, this usually comes at the cost of increased complexity and decreased scalability.

40|$|Abstract—Wireless mesh {{networks}} have attracted increasing attention and deployment as a high-performance and low-cost solution to last-mile broadband Internet access. Traffic routing plays {{a critical role}} in determining the performance of a wireless mesh network. To investigate the best <b>routing</b> <b>solution,</b> existing work proposes to formulate the mesh network routing problem as an optimization problem. In this problem formulation, traffic demand is usually implicitly assumed to be static and known a priori. Contradictorily, recent studies of wireless network traces show that the traffic demand, even being aggregated at access points, is highly dynamic and hard to estimate. Thus, in order to apply the optimization-based <b>routing</b> <b>solution</b> in practice, one must take into account the dynamic and unpredictable nature of wireless traffic demand. This paper studies the oblivious routing algorithm that is able to provide the optimal worst-case performance on all possible traffic demands users may impose on the wireless mesh network, where the goal is to minimize the maximum congestion appearing at all interference sets in the network over all properly scaled traffic demand patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt that investigates the oblivious routing issue in the context of wireless mesh networks.
