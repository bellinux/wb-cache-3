25|$|Today, all {{funding for}} state {{highways}} and around 50% {{of funding for}} local roads comes directly from road users through the National Land Transport Fund. <b>Road</b> <b>user</b> revenue directed to the fund includes all fuel excise duty on LPG and CNG, around 55% of revenue from fuel excise duty on petrol, all revenue from <b>road</b> <b>user</b> charges (a prepaid distance/weight licence that all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, and all non petrol/LPG/CNG vehicles are liable to pay) and most non-ACC revenue from motor vehicle registration and licensing fees. In addition, {{in the last three}} years the government has increasingly allocated additional funds to land transport, to the extent that today the total expenditure by the NZ Transport Agency on land transport projects exceeds road tax revenue collected. The remainder of funding for local city and district roads primarily comes from local authority property rates.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} of testing self-driving vehicles in mixed traffic arises from the interaction with other <b>road</b> <b>users.</b> In some situations, {{it is not clear}} what the vehicle will do next and how other <b>road</b> <b>users</b> should behave. For example, the shuttle signals a stop via a display on the back windshield. However, does this mean for the other <b>road</b> <b>users</b> that it is safe to overtake the shuttle or should they also stop behind the shuttle? Another example is that other <b>road</b> <b>users</b> abandon their priority that confuses the shuttle and thus leads to pat-situations where neither the shuttle nor the other vehicle move on. In some situations, other <b>road</b> <b>users</b> were not aware whether the shuttle had recognised them as an obstacle and if they can continue their drive or if they should stop. Right now, these kinds of questions are completely open and standards for the interaction with other <b>road</b> <b>users</b> are missing.|$|R

25|$|The sight {{distance}} {{needed for a}} given situation is the distance travelled during the two phases of a driving maneuver: perception-reaction time (PRT), and maneuver time (MT).

25|$|People who {{are driving}} {{as part of}} their work duties are an {{important}} <b>road</b> <b>user</b> category. First, workers themselves are at risk of road traffic injury. Contributing factors include fatigue and long work hours, delivery pressures, distractions from mobile phones and other devices, lack of training to operate the assigned vehicle, vehicle defects, use of prescription and non-prescription medications, medical conditions, and poor journey planning. Death, disability, or injury of a family wage earner due to road traffic injury, in addition to causing emotional pain and suffering, creates economic hardship for the injured worker and family members that may persist well beyond the event itself.|$|E
25|$|A {{report by}} TfL in early 2007 {{indicated}} that there were 2.27 traffic delays per kilometre in the original charging zone. This compared with a figure of 2.3 before {{the introduction of the}} congestion charge. After the scheme was introduced they had measured an improvement in journey times of 0.7 minutes per km, or 30%. This improvement had decreased to 22% in 2006, and during 2006 congestion levels had increased so that the improvement, compared to the year before the scheme, was just 7%. TfL explained this as a result of changes to road priorities within the zone, delays caused by new pedestrian and <b>road</b> <b>user</b> safety schemes, and, most particularly, a doubling of road works {{in the latter half of}} 2006. Utilities were encouraged to complete planned road works in the year preceding the congestion charge, so it would appear that the first year of measurement used for later comparisons would also have been affected by streetworks to some extent.|$|E

40|$|When {{applying}} dynamic {{route guidance}} to improve the road network performance, {{the interests of the}} road authorities and the <b>road</b> <b>users</b> are likely to conflict. <b>Road</b> <b>users</b> are normally aiming at minimising their travel times by choosing the time-shortest route, whereas the authorities might want to send <b>road</b> <b>users</b> to a time-longer alternative to prevent phenomena like capacity drop and spill-back. In this study, the authors demonstrate how, in such a situation, bounded rationality and indifference bands (IB) of <b>road</b> <b>users</b> can be used to improve the network performance, such that the <b>road</b> <b>users</b> will not experience being disadvantaged by the advice. An interpretation and utilisation of the IBs in a route guidance control approach is proposed, which degrades the routes such that the network performance deterioration is prevented while the IBs of <b>road</b> <b>users</b> are respected. By means of a simulation test case, the potential gain in network performance of different IBs is evaluated. Results show a reduction in total travel time of 5 % compared with user equilibrium, in case of an IB of 4 min for a trip of ~ 22 min, and up to 14 % in case of an IB of 10 min...|$|R

2500|$|Speed {{reduction}} {{has traditionally}} been attempted {{by the introduction of}} statutory speed limits.

[...] Zones where speeds are set at 30 km/h (or 20mph) are gaining popularity [...] as they are found to be effective at reducing crashes and increasing community cohesion. Speed limits which are set below the speed that most motorists perceive to be reasonable for the given road require additional measures to improve compliance.
