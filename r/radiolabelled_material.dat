In patients with active disease mucus production was {{not significantly different from}} normal subjects.

Quantification of m-tyrosine has been widely used as an index of oxidative damage in tissue proteins.

We demonstrated that proteolytic digests of 3 H-methylated G 25 K contained <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> that coeluted with synthetic S-(geranylgeranyl) cysteine methyl ester on reversed-phase HPLC.

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) beta gamma complexes purified from bovine brain membranes are methyl esterified on a C-terminal cysteine residue of the gamma polypeptide. In the present study, 3 H-methylated G beta gamma complexes cleaved to their constituent amino acids by exhaustive proteolysis {{were shown to}} contain <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> that coeluted with geranylgeranylcysteine methyl ester on reversed-phase HPLC and two TLC systems. Further treatment by performic acid oxidation yielded <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> that coeluted with L-cysteic acid methyl ester, verifying that the prenyl modification occurs on a C-terminal cysteine residue. Analysis by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry of material released from purified G beta gamma by treatment with Raney nickel positively identified the covalently bound lipid as an all-trans-geranylgeranyl (C 20) isoprenoid moiety. To delineate the distribution of this modification among gamma subunits, purified G beta gamma complexes were separated into 5 -kDa (gamma 5) and 6 -kDa (gamma 6) forms of the gamma polypeptide by reversed-phase HPLC. Gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry analyses of Raney nickel-treated purified gamma 5 and gamma 6 subunits showed that both polypeptides were modified by geranylgeranylation. These results demonstrate {{that at least two}} forms of brain gamma subunit are posttranslationally modified by geranylgeranylation and carboxyl methylation.

40|$|The G 2 line of peas (Pisum sativum L.) {{displays}} senescence {{and death}} of the apical bud only in long days and {{in the presence of}} fruit. As the removal of fruit prevents senescence, one possible mechanism by which fruits induce senescence is that the fruits produce some `senescence factor' under long day conditions, which is then transported to the apical bud. Allowing developing fruits to photosynthesize in the presence of 14 CO 2 results in the recovery of label in the apical bud. In order to determine the chemical nature of this <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material,</b> fruits of G 2 peas, growing under long days, were exposed to 14 CO 2 at the time when the first senescence symptoms start to appear. The <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> from apical buds was then extracted, purified, and identified. Using HPLC and GC-MS the major labeled compound found in the apical bud following exposure of pea fruits to 14 CO 2 was identified as sucrose, while malic acid was identified as the major ethyl acetate-soluble compound. These compounds accounted for about 73 and 16 %, respectively, of the radioactivity in the apical bud. No other compounds were present in significant amounts. As neither of these chemicals is likely to have any kind of senescence effect, we report no evidence for a senescence factor...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the influence of anti-idiotypic antibodies on the complementary idiotype (Id), the clearance kinetics, tissue distribution and fate of idiotype-anti-idiotype complexes were investigated in mice. The complexes were prepared by mixing purified radiolabelled monomeric (mIgA) or polymeric IgA (pIgA) with monoclonal anti-T 15 idiotype (B 39 - 38). The 24 hr clearance from circulation of intravenously administered mIgA, mIgA-anti-Id complexes, pIgA and pIgA-anti-Id complexes showed three exponential phases. There {{was no significant difference in}} the amount, half-life (t 1 / 2), or organ distribution of mIgA and mIgA-anti-Id during the first two phases. The mIgA-anti-Id complexes were removed at a faster rate (9. 2 +/- 0. 5 hr) than the mIgA alone (17. 7 +/- 1. 3 hr) during the third phase. In contrast, anti-Id affected the clearance of pIgA during the first phase whereby 75 % of the administered pIgA-anti-Id complexes, compared with 50 % of the pIgA, cleared from the circulation with a t 1 / 2 of 3 min. This rapid removal from circulation was mediated predominantly by the liver, where 66 % of pIgA-anti-Id and 40 % of pIgA were detected 10 min after administration of the <b>radiolabelled</b> <b>material.</b> In the second phase, pIgA-anti-Id were removed from circulation at a faster rate (t 1 / 2 = 28 min) than pIgA (t 1 / 2 = 43 min). During this phase, 1 hr after administration of <b>radiolabelled</b> <b>material,</b> significantly more pIgA-anti-Id than pIgA were localized in the liver, kidneys, skin and spleen. In contrast, the digestive tract contained more pIgA (22 %) than pIgA-anti-Id (11 %). Analysis of the mIgA-anti-Id and pIgA-anti-Id by gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that mIgA-anti-Id were composed of small-sized complexes, while intermediate-sized complexes constituted the majority of the pIgA-anti-Id complexes. These results suggest that the modulatory effect of anti-Id on the complementary IgA idiotype is determined largely by the molecular form of the IgA and the size of the Id-anti-Id complexes...|$|E
40|$|The {{sedimentation}} f radiolabelled 22 nm hepatitis B {{surface antigen}} particles was unaffected by treatment with either trypsin or SDS alone, but combined treatment disrupted the particulate {{nature of the}} <b>radiolabelled</b> <b>material.</b> Con-siderable antibody binding activity by the group-specific determinant (a) was preserved after combined SDS and trypsin treatment but {{was released from the}} bulk of the radiolabelled protein; gel filtration indicated an approximate mol. wt. of 5 too to 15 ooo for the released antibody binding material. This material was precipitated by concanavalin A, suggesting the presence of carbohydrate. Its serological activity was remarkably resistant to boiling and to proteolytic digestion, but was partially sensitive to treatment with o-oi M-periodate orwith mixed carbohydrases and neuraminidase, and was greatly reduced by treatment with reducing agent. These data suggest that the stability of the a determinant is due to the structure of the antibody binding site itself, rather than to involvement in the quaternary structure of the particle, and that intact disulphide bonds and carbohydrate, closely related to the antibody binding site, are necessary for the full expression of serological activity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{standard}} in vitro protocol currently in use for drug testing against Plasmodium falciparum, {{based on the}} incorporation of the purine [3 H]-hypoxanthine, has two serious drawbacks. Firstly it is unsuitable for the testing of drugs that directly or indirectly impact on purine salvage or metabolism. Secondly, it relies {{on the use of}} expensive <b>radiolabelled</b> <b>material,</b> with added issues concerning detection, storage and waste disposal that make it unsuitable for use in many disease-endemic areas. Recently, the use of fluorochromes has been suggested as an alternative, but quenching of the fluorescence signal by the haemoglobin present in cultures of Plasmodium falciparum -infected erythrocytes severely limits the usefulness of this approach. Methods In order to resolve this problem, a new PicoGreen ® -based procedure has been developed which incorporates additional steps to remove the interfering haemoglobin. The 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of chloroquine and pyrimethamine against P. falciparum laboratory lines 3 D 7 and K 1 were determined using the new protocol. Results The IC 50 values of chloroquine and pyrimethamine against P. falciparum laboratory lines 3 D 7 and K 1 determined with the new fluorescence-based protocol were statistically identical to those obtained using the traditional 3 H-hypoxanthine incorporation method, and consistent with literature values. Conclusion The new method proved to be accurate, reproducible and sensitive, and has the advantage of being non-radioactive. The improved PicoGreen ® method has the potential to replace traditional in vitro drug resistance assay techniques. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{graphical}} {{procedure for}} determining the specific activity of radiolabeled ligands has been developed for use with radioimmunoassays. Although with this procedure we utilize the same experimental information required for displacement analysis, we are also able to determine both the specific activity and the binding constants of the labeled and unlabeled materials without assuming that these constants are equal; the concentration of antibody-binding sites can also be calculated. Thus, this graphical technique permits calculation of additional information without ad-ditional experimentation.

Biochem. (Tokyo) 114, 862 - 873]. On metabolic labelling of the proteoglycan with [32 P]Pi, followed by identification of the <b>radiolabelled</b> <b>material</b> using glycanases, almost all the isotope {{was found to have}} been incorporated into a core portion of molecular mass 48 kDa, which was generated by digestion with heparan sulphate lyase I plus chondroitin ABC lyase. Immunoblotting of the core protein with a monoclonal antibody, F 58 - 6 G 12, demonstrated that the proteoglycan was mouse syndecan- 2. CsCl-density-gradient centrifugation after mild treatment of liposome-intercalated 32 P-labelled syndecan- 2 with trypsin resulted in clear separation of the radioactivity into a bottom fraction containing all the glycosaminoglycans (accounting for 40 % of the total radioactivity) and a top fraction containing liposome-associated peptides (60 %). The former isotope was shown to be linked covalently to both heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate chains, probably at their bridge regions. The latter was mostly attributed to phosphoserine, the one and only phosphorylated amino acid released on acid hydrolysis of this proteoglycan, strongly suggesting that the phosphorylation occurs at a specific serine residue(s) in the cytoplasmic domain of the core protein...|$|E
40|$|Viper venom disintegrins {{contain the}} RGD/KGD motif. They inhibit {{platelet}} aggregation and cell adhesion, but show structural and functional heterogeneity. We investigated {{the interaction of}} four prototypic disintegrins with alpha IIb beta 3 expressed {{on the surface of}} resting and activated platelets. The binding affinity (Kd) of 125 I-albolabrin, 125 I-echistatin, 125 I-bitistatin and 125 I-eristostatin toward resting platelets was 294, 153, 48 and 18 nM respectively. The Kd value for albolabrin decreased 3 -fold and 6 -fold after ADP- or thrombin-induced activation. The Kd values for bitistatin and echistatin also decreased with ADP, but there was no further decrease with thrombin. In contrast, eristostatin bound with the same high affinity to resting and activated platelets. The pattern of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -eristostatin and FITC-albolabrin binding to resting and activated platelets was consistent with observations using <b>radiolabelled</b> <b>material.</b> Eristostatin showed faster and more irreversible binding to platelets, and greater potency compared with albolabrin in inducing conformational neo-epitopes in beta 3. The anti-alpha IIb beta 3 monoclonal antibody OP-G 2 that is RGD-dependent inhibited disintegrin binding to activated platelets more strongly than binding to resting platelets and it inhibited the binding to platelets of albolabrin more strongly than eristostatin.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to utilise click chemistry to develop novel types of 18 F labelled carbohydrates for use in positron emission tomography imaging through the coupling of [18 F]-fluoroalkynes with various 1 -azido sugars and 2 -azido sugars. In total, eight novel compounds were synthesized in this study. The products of the click reaction between various types of alkynes and 1 -azido sugars, the 1, 2, 3 -triazole sugars, were afforded in good yields. Two hydroxy triazole sugars prepared in this manner were fluorinated and used as cold standards for HPLC analysis and identification of the analogous <b>radiolabelled</b> <b>material.</b> It was subsequently demonstrated that 1 -azido glucosamine could be succesfully labelled with fluorine- 18 in just 8 mins via a click reaction using 4 -[18 F]-fluoro- 1 -butyne. The above work was then extended to the preparation of 2 -azido sugar triazoles, which widens the scope of click reactions on 2 -azido sugars as only a few examples have been reported in the literature. Further extension of the work to the conjugation of 1 -azido glucosamine and 1 -azido glucuronide methyl ester with an acetylenic phenol, provided new examples of sugar triazole compounds which might be labelled with fluorine- 18 using the same methods as those used to radiolabel the well known imaging agent fluoroethyltyrosine. In summary, the click reaction is a very useful method for radiolabelling carbohydrates, which can be achieved in short reaction times and in good yield. The methodology that was developed here can be used to modify various bioactive peptides with radiolabelled carbohydrates to generate new types of cancer imaging agents...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} glucose-analogue inhibitors of {{glycogen}} phosphorylase b (GPb) has been designed, synthesized and investigated in crystallographic binding and kinetic studies. The {{aim is to}} produce a compound that may exert more effective control over glycogen metabolism than the parent glucose molecule and which could alleviate hyperglycaemia in Type-II diabetes. N-Acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosylamine (1 -GlcNAc) has a Ki for muscle GPb in crude extracts of 30 microM, 367 -fold {{lower than that of}} beta-D-glucose [Board, Hadwen and Johnson (1995) Eur. J. Biochem. 228, 753 - 761]. In the current work, the effects of 1 -GlcNAc on the activation states of GP and glycogen synthase (GS) in cell-free preparations and in isolated hepatocytes are reported. In gel-filtered extracts of liver, which lack ATP for kinase activity, 1 -GlcNAc produced a rapid and time-dependent inactivation of GP with a subsequent activation of GS. Effects of 1 -GlcNAc on both enzymes were stronger than those of glucose, with 0. 8 mM 1 -GlcNAc being equipotent with 50 mM glucose. At 1 mM, 1 -GlcNAc enhanced the dephosphorylation of exogenous GPa by liver extracts (600 %) and by muscle extracts (75 %). This represents an approximately 500 -fold improvement on glucose for the liver activity and 40 -fold for the muscle activity. In whole hepatocytes, 1 -GlcNAc showed an approximately 5 -fold enhancement of glucose effects for GP inactivation but failed to elicit activation of GS. Glucose-induced activation of GS in whole hepatocytes was reversed by subsequent addition of 1 -GlcNAc. However, when GS activation was achieved via the adenosine analogue and kinase inhibitor, 5 '-iodotubercidin (ITU), subsequent addition of 1 -GlcNAc allowed continued activation of GS. Phosphorylation of 1 -GlcNAc in rat hepatocytes was established using <b>radiolabelled</b> <b>material.</b> The rate of phosphorylation was 1. 60 nmol/min per 10 (6) cells at 20 mM 1 -GlcNAc but was reduced by the presence of 50 microM ITU (0. 775 nmol/min per 10 (6) cells). It is suggested that the phosphorylated derivative of 1 -GlcNAc formed in hepatocytes is 1 -GlcNAc 6 -phosphate and that the presence of this species is responsible for the failure of 1 -GlcNAc to activate GS. The relative importance of the reduction in concentration of GPa versus increased glucose 6 -phosphate levels for activation of GS is discussed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In New Zealand {{malignant}} ovine lymphoma is a low-prevalence, sporadic disease affecting sheep 4 {{years and}} older. The aetiology {{of the disease}} is unknown but a previous study showed that when cell-free extracts of ovine lymphomas were inoculated into in utero and new-born lambs they developed a persistent lymphocytosis and cell-mediated immunity to the lymphoma extracts. Furthermore, particles interpreted as virus-like were observed by electron microscopy in phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes from these sheep. This thesis reports the continued investigation of sporadic ovine lymphoma including its immunological characterisation and a search for evidence of conventional retroviruses. Techniques {{for the detection of}} T cell-specific antigens, surface immunoglobulin, complement receptors and Fc receptors on lymphocytes from the blood and mesenteric lymph nodes from normal sheep were established and ranges of values for T and B cells determined. The use of α naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) as a specific marker for sheep T cells was investigated. No correlation was found between T lymphocytes and ANAE-positive cells. Cells from 17 cases of lymphoma were characterised for the presence of T cell antigens and surface immunoglobulin, markers for T and B cells respectively. Seven cases were T cell and 6 were B cell in origin; in one case cells displayed both markers and in another there were similar numbers of both T and B cells; the cells from the remaining 2 cases had neither marker. An apparent correlation was found between the patho-anatomical classification of the disease and the immunological origin of the lymphoma. All the T cell lymphomas were of multicentric distribution, whereas 4 of the 6 B cell neoplasms were confined to the alimentary tract and its associated lymphoid tissue. There was no correlation between the cellular morphology of the lymphomas and whether they were T or B cell in origin. Electron microscopy of several ovine lymphomas and their suspension cultures revealed only a few nonbudding particles with the dimensions of retroviruses. Smaller vesicular structures were seen associated with cells from a single suspension culture and in control cultures but these were considered unlikely to be of viral origin. Attempts were made to establish continuous cell cultures derived from ovine lymphomas. These included the culturing of lymphoma cells either over normal fibroblast "feeder" monolayers in various combinations of media and sera, or in simple Suspension cultures. Alternatively, lymphoma tissue was used in plasma clot explant cultures. Limited success occurred only with the plasma clot explant cultures where cells from one lymphoma survived 2 passages. Several fibroblast cell lines derived from the lymphoma explant cultures have been developed and passaged over 20 times. To detect the presence of retroviruses in a variety of materials derived from ovine lymphomas, 2 biochemical techniques were used. The first involved the assay of culture supernatants for 3 H uridine-labelled virus in density gradients, and the second the search for RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP) activity in various preparations. Four ovine lymphoma cell suspension cultures were assayed for the production of RNA-containing virus particles. Tritiated uridine was added at the time the cultures were established and the media harvested after 96 hr. The pellets obtained following differential ultracentrifugation were centrifuged through 15 to 60 percent sucrose gradients and fractions of the gradient were assayed for acid-precipitable radioactivity. Although radiolabeled material was detected at densities of 1. 15 to 1. 18 gm per ml in preparations of 2 lymphoma cultures, normal lymph node cultures yielded similar results. <b>Radiolabelled</b> <b>material</b> treated with sodium dodecyl sulphate and sedimented through a sucrose gradient had a sedimentation value of approximately 7 S. No high molecular weight RHA consistent with that of retroviruses was found. Further experiments using normal ovine fibroblasts led {{to the conclusion that the}} <b>radiolabelled</b> <b>material</b> detected in the 15 to 60 percent sucrose gradient was probably slowly sedimenting cellular RNA. The RDDP assay was performed on ultracentrifuged preparations from media of lymphoma and normal lymph node cultures, and Rous sarcoma and bovine leukaemia viruses were used as positive controls. Incorporation of 3 H thymidine triphosphate into acid-insoluble material was detected in 4 of 16 ovine lymphoma cultures but was also found in material from control lymph node cultures. Little variation in incorporation kinetics could be evinced by altering the assay conditions, and the observed activity was not associated with a particle of density 1. 15 gm per ml. Furthermore, RDDP could not be detected in preparations from the homogenates of 6 lymphomas. It was concluded that the activity observed in both the lymphoma and control lymphocyte preparations was not due to RDDP. Depressed responsiveness by lymphocytes to nonspecific mitogens has been associated with infections by retroviruses in other species. However, there were no differences in responses to phytohaemagglutinin by lymphocytes from lymphoma-inoculated and control sheep. Although conventional retroviruses have not been clearly demonstrated in association with sporadic ovine lymphoma in these experiments, the failure to detect virus does not rule out the possibility of retroviral involvement at some stage of lymphomagenesis. The development of more sensitive techniques might allow the detection of low levels of virus or viral nucleic acid sequences within cells...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the observations of}} field trials and analytical investigations of the residues of maleic hydrazide (1, 2 -dihydro- 3, 6 -pyridazinedione) known as MH. MH is marketed in a formulation called `Fazor' and {{was introduced to the}} United Kingdom under PSPS (Pesticide Safety Precaution Scheme) in 1985. It is targeted at sprout suppression of ware tubers in store with the added benefits of increased marketable yield and reduced groundkeepers. Two field trials were conducted to investigate the sprout inhibition of MH and its effect on yield. Both field trials used a popular ware seed (c. v. Maris Piper) grown under typical growth conditions and treated with Fazor(5 kg/ 500 litres/hectare) under optimum conditions. Treated potatoes were observed to have typical characteristics of a break in apical dominance. Every eye on the tubers was active and formed spikelets that developed into growths similar in appearance to a small cauliflower head. It was also noticed that sprout suppression was not complete. A proportion of potatoes had inadequate suppression. Some showed no characteristics of MH, typical of an untreated potato. The inadequate sprout suppression was investigated by analysing the MH distribution and the comparison of sprout suppression. MH treated plots were found to have slightly lower yields than untreated plots. This reduction in yield was not shown to be statistically significant. Two methods to calculate the residues of MH were adapted. The first used the action of zinc in concentrated sodium hydroxide to produce hydrogen, which reduced and hydrolysed MH to hydrazine. The hydrazine was distilled and caught in an acid scrubber containing a colour reagent. The colour reagent and hydrazine combined to produce a coloured chromophore. The colour intensity was proportional to the amount of MH. This method was used to calculate the total MH. The second method calculated the amount of free MH (not metabolised or conjugated) by a methanol extraction, cleanup of the concentrate and analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The total MH was roughly made up of three factions:- (1) Non-extractable MH (2) Methanol extractable MH (a) free MH (b) metabolised MH The uptake of MH over a four week period, after spraying Fazor, was assessed by harvesting at weekly intervals for four weeks and analysing the tubers by the above methods. The distribution of MH between individual tubers was investigated by calculating the MH in whole tubers. The distribution within individual tubers was calculated by analysing the skin, the outer flesh and the inner core. The distribution of MH between grades was calculated. The carryover of MH into processed foods was calculated by analysis of crisps and boiled potatoes from field treated plots. It was found that the MH accumulated in the potato tubers before one week and remained static up to four weeks. However, there was a fraction, a possible metabolite, that increased in concentration, whereas the free MH concentration decreased. Sprout suppression was found to be dependent on the total MH. Small tubers had lower concentrations than larger tubers. MH was found throughout the whole tuber with a slightly lower concentration in the core. MH was also found in fried and boiled potatoes and was identified as free MH. The metabolites of MH were investigated by applying radiolabelled MH to greenhouse grown potato plants. The potatoes were extracted by methanol and the concentrated extracts separated by thin layer chromatography (tlc). A metabolite was detected after exposing the plates to X-ray photographic plates. However, this metabolite was not successfully identified. This was due to the combination of low specific activity of the <b>radiolabelled</b> <b>material,</b> and the low quantity of metabolite produced. Hydrolytic enzymes were used to cleave possible conjugated metabolites in the potato juice concentrates. The action of a beta-D-glucosidase was found to increase the free MH. This would appear to suggest that a metabolite of MH is a conjugated product between MH and a glucose molecule. However, a conjugate could not be synthesized between uridine diphospho glucose (UDPG) and MH with soluble potato protein. There was no evidence to suggest that a metabolite is produced between MH and glutathione. It was suspected that MH would inhibit wound healing because it inhibits cell division. Cut potatoes treated with various concentrations of MH were examined histologically to assess cell division and suberin production. The rate of water loss from potato discs treated with MH was calculated. If the rate of water loss does not slow down because of chemical inhibition of the process, potatoes will lose weight and condition in store. No difference between control potatoes and MH treated potatoes was found {{at the beginning of a}} storage season.

The bulk of this evidence rests upon reverse transcriptase studies (1 - 3), DNA-RNA hybridization homologies (4, 5), immunochemical analysis of viral-like antigens in human tissues (6 - 8), and the isolation of C-type viruses from human tissues (9 - 11). Recently, Mak et al. (12) and Vosika et al. (13) reported that some human marrows in culture-released particles with some physical and biochemical properties resembling those of oncornaviruses. We have undertaken to examine the immunological properties of particles obtained in similar marrow culture supernates, {{particularly with regard to}} (a) whether they contain determinants cross-reactive with mammalian RNA tumor viruses and (b) whether antibodies to such determinants occur spontaneously in human sera. Internally <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> from marrow culture supernates was used as antigen in a double-antibody immunoprecipitation assay, and precipitated antigens were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In this paper, we report that proteins similar to those of th...|$|R
40|$|A {{very simple}} {{procedure}} which enhances sensitivity in visualizing proteins stained by all standard procedures in polyacrylamide gels is described. The process, {{based on the}} use of concentrated polyethylene glycol 6000 solutions, produces a conspicuous, reversible, and uniform size reduction of gels. The entity of the reduction depends principally on the polyethylene glycol 6000 concentration and on the acrylamide content of gels. Using an appropriate polyethylene glycol 6000 concentration, it is possible to regulate the final size and then the sensitivity as needed. Depending upon the above conditions it is possible to increase the sensitivity by a factor of 4 - 6 or more. Reduction of the gel volume by such a factor may eliminate the need for the cumbersome and frequently impossible preconcentration of samples. Besides the Coomassie blue stained gels, silver stained gels may also be treated in a similar manner with a consequent further enhancement in sensitivity. In addition, gels containing <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>materials</b> can be autoradiographed in times proportionally shorter, without significant sacrifice of resolution...|$|R
40|$|Proteoglycans are glycoconjugates {{composed}} of a core protein and covalcntly attached glycosaminoglycans. Skeletal muscle produces {{a number of different}} types of proteogiycans, and, importantly, the types of proteogiycans made by skeletal muscle vary during muscle development. At early stages of muscle development, large chondroiim sulfate proteogiycans of the PG-M/versican type are produced both in culture and in vivo. Localization both by autoradiography of <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> and by imrnunohistochemistry indicates that the chondroitin sulfate proteogiycans are deposited in a peri cellular region around the muscle cells. Although biosynthesis of these molecules is not detected in mature skeielal muscle, their synthesis is re-initiated during regeneration, which suggests a requirement for these molecules in some early aspect of muscle development. Al later stages of muscle development, small dermatan sulfate proteogiycans are synthesized. One of the::iajor types of dermatan sulfate proteogiycans in skeletal muscle is decorin, which can bind to collagen and affect fibril formation. Decorin is initially localized in the fibrous connective tissue areas of skeletal muscle, but eventually, at later stages of muscle development, is also found in proximity to th...|$|R
40|$|Corneal {{specimens}} obtained {{during surgery}} from patients with macular corneal dystrophy and obtained at autopsy from control eyes were incubated {{in a medium}} containing radioactive precursors of glycoproteins and proteoglycans. Biosynthetically <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> was extracted and characterized by using molecular sieve chromatography and specific enzymes. Cells in control corneas synthesized both a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and a keratan sulfate proteoglycan similar to those present in monkey and bovine corneas. Cells in macular corneas synthesized a normal chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan but did not synthesize either keratan sulfate or a mature keratan sulfate proteoglycan. Instead, macular corneas synthesized a glycoprotein with unusually large oligosaccharide side chains. This glycoprotein was not detected in normal corneas and is slightly smaller than normal keratan sulfate proteoglycan. The failure to synthesize a mature keratan sulfate proteoglycan may produce corneal opacity and result in blindness. Because of evidence indicating that the corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan is normally synthesized through a glycoprotein intermediate [Hart, G. W. & Lennarz, W. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253 - 5795 - 5801], macular corneal dystrophy may be a defect in glycoprotein processing...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} ecdysone, the steroid molting hormone of arthropods, are of {{considerable}} interest both to insect physiologists {{and to those}} studying steroid-regulated gene expression. Yet progress in understanding ecdysone receptors has been inhibited {{by the lack of}} a suitable highly radioactive hormone analog with high affinity for the receptor. Here we report that the synthetic ecdysteroid 26 -iodoponasterone A {{is one of the most}} active ecdysones known, inducing half-maximal morphological transformation in Drosophila Kc 167 cells when present at 0. 5 nM. 26 -[125 I]Iodoponasterone A can be prepared at a specific activity of 2175 Ci/mmol (1 Ci = 37 GBq) by reaction of the precursor 26 -mesylinokosterone with carrier-free Na 125 I. The <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> binds to Kc 167 cell ecdysone receptors specifically and with affinity (Kd ca. 3. 8 X 10 (- 10) M). Thus, 26 -[125 I]iodoponasterone A appears to be a superior radioligand for ecdysone receptors on grounds both of affinity and of specific activity. Its ready availability should greatly facilitate studies of these receptors...|$|R
40|$|A mouse mAb, TS 43, which {{recognized}} the human CD 5 molecule, {{was found to}} induce the proliferation of human peripheral blood T cells. TS 43 mAb precipitated from 125 I-radiolabeled T cells a 67 -kDa band, which comigrated with the 67 -kDa band precipitated by the anti-CD 5 mAb OKT 1. Preclearing of cell lysates with OKT 1 mAb abolished the capacity of TS 43 mAb to precipitate <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> from T cell lysates. Furthermore, a mouse T cell hybridoma transfected with human CD 5 was stained by TS 43 mAb. T cell proliferation mediated by TS 43 mAb was monocyte dependent, and was accompanied by IL- 2 R expression and by IL- 2 synthesis. T cell activation by TS 43 mAb involved a rise in intracellular calcium level (CA 2 +) i and was dependent on {{the expression of the}} TCR/CD 3 complex because no rise in (Ca 2 +) i was observed in a TCR-beta-deficient Jurkat T cell mutant. This study indicates that CD 5 should be added to the list of surface molecules that can signal T cells to proliferate...|$|R
40|$|A {{radioimmunoassay}} {{capable of}} measuring 1 pmole of human fibrinopeptide A has been developed, and should prove useful {{to detect the}} release of this peptide from fibrinogen during the coagulation process. Antibodies to fibrinopeptide A were produced by injecting New Zealand white rabbits {{with a mixture of}} Freund's adjuvant and native fibrinopeptide coupled to human albumin. N-Tyrosyl fibrinopeptide A was synthesized by the solid-phase method, and was iodinated with 125 I by the Chloramine-T method. 48 - 73 % of the radiolabeled peptide could be bound by the serum of a rabbit immunized with the fibrinopeptide-albumin preparation. Antibody-bound peptide was precipitated by dioxane and was thus separated from unbound peptide. The addition of excess native fibrinopeptide to the <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> prevented its binding to serum. Native fibrinopeptide A and synthetic fibrinopeptide A were identical in their ability to prevent binding, whereas fibrinogen was from 1 / 25, 000 to 1 / 50, 000 as effective on a weight basis. Plasma filtered through a membrane relatively impermeable to molecules larger than a molecular weight of 34, 000 showed no fibrinopeptide reactivity, whereas a similar filtrate of serum gave quantitative recovery of fibrinopeptide reactivity...|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} directed primarily against antigenic determinants {{associated with}} the goldfish optic nerve were prepared and characterized. One selected clone 23 - 4 -C(IgG 2 a), detected antigenic determinants of glycoprotein nature with an apparent mol. wt. of 140 000. Following injury the level of these molecules increased with a peak at 5 - 7 days after the lesion (2 - to 3 -fold higher than the basal level). The results strongly suggest that the increase derives, at least partially, from a real increment {{in the level of}} these molecules in the retinal ganglion cells rather than from changes in accessibility. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that the retinal ganglion cells carry the antigenicity. Intraocular injection of the monoclonal antibodies, concomitantly with crush injury, resulted in an earlier and higher regenerative response, reflected by sprouting capacity, protein synthesis and accumulation of <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> in the tectum contralateral to the side of injury. This may indicate that the antibodies directly activate retinal cells via interaction with surface molecules. Alternatively, the antibodies may be directed against surface molecules which are associated with axonal growth inhibitors, and may therefore mask these surface antigens from further interaction with their native substrate...|$|R

These interactions are essential for numerous cellular functions, and in silico methods of reducing in vitro trial and error would accelerate the pace of research in cell biology. We have utilized a combination of three-dimensional protein modeling and protein bioinformatics to identify domains present in Rab proteins that are predictive of their functional interaction with a specific RabGAP. The RabF 2 and RabSF 1 domains appear to play functional roles in mediating the interaction between Rabs and RabGAPs. Moreover, the RabSF 1 domain {{can be used to}} make in silico predictions of functional Rab/RabGAP pairs. This method is expected to be a broadly applicable tool for predicting protein–protein interactions where existing crystal structures for homologs of the proteins of interest are available.

40|$|Rates of {{substrate}} hydrolysis by nonattached {{bacteria and}} by bacteria attached to particles derived from marine diatom frustules were estimated by using two substrates, a dipeptide analog and a protein. Adsorption {{of the two}} substrates onto the particles was also evaluated. Methyl-coumarinyl-amide-leucine (MCA-leucine) was used to estimate hydrolysis of dipeptides by measuring an increase in fluorescence as MCA-leucine was hydrolyzed to leucine and the fluorochrome methylcoumarin. To examine hydrolysis of a larger molecule, we prepared a radiolabeled protein by 14 C-methylation of bovine serum albumin. The rate of protein hydrolysis in samples of particle-attached or nonattached bacteria was estimated by precipitating all nonhydrolyzed protein with cold trichloroacetic acid and then determining the trichloroacetic acid-soluble <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material,</b> which represented methyl- 14 C-peptides and -amino acids. About 25 % of the MCA-leucine adsorbed to the particles. MCA-leucine was hydrolyzed faster by nonattached than attached bacteria, which was probably related to its tendency to remain dissolved in the liquid phase. In contrast, almost 100 % of the labeled protein adsorbed to the particles. Accordingly, protein was much less available to nonattached bacteria but was rapidly hydrolyzed by attached bacteria...|$|R
40|$|The fate of Escherichia coli strains {{within the}} {{polymorphonuclear}} leukocytes was studied by determining {{the killing of}} bacteria, measuring the release of degradation products, and examining the phagocytic bacteria by electron microscopy. When sufficiently opsonized, both unencapsulated and encapsulated E. coli strains were rapidly phagocytized by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Once phagocytized, the two unencapsulated E. coli strains (K- 12 and O 111) were rapidly killed (99 % of the bacteria were killed during the first 5 min of phagocytosis) and extensively degraded (about 40 % of the <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> was released from bacteria after 15 min of phagocytosis). Electron micrographs taken after 15 min of phagocytosis revealed extensive structural changes {{in most of the}} internalized bacteria. In contrast to the rapid killing and extensive breakdown of these strains, encapsulated E. coli O 78 :K 80 was more resistant to killing and withstood degradation by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (only 5 % of the radioactivity was released from the radiolabeled bacteria after 1 h of phagocytosis). Electron micrographs of thin sections taken after 1 h of phagocytosis revealed virtually no structural changes. Most of the internalized bacteria were still surrounded by thick capsular material...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} activation of the reticuloendothelial system on the localization of immune complexes in the kidney, a model of passive serum sickness nephritis in the mouse was used, with activation of the reticuloendothelial system with Corynebacterium parvum. Groups of mice, control and C. parvum-treated animals, were injected with BSA- 125 I-anti-BSA complexes containing 3 mg 125 I-anti-BSA. Blood was obtained at 5 min, at 3 h, and at 12 h, when the animals were killed. Blood concentrations of BSA- 125 I-anti-BSA complexes were reduced in C. parvum-treated animals compared with controls. This appeared to be mediated by two effects, increased uptake of complexes in the liver and spleen, and enhanced degradation of immune complexes as measured by TCA-soluble radioactivity. In vitro studies using cultures of peritoneal macrophages also showed enhanced uptake of immune complexes. The amount of immune complexes deposited in the glomeruli of C. parvum-treated animals was reduced as determined by quantitation of <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> bound to isolated gomeruli and by immunofluorescence techniques. The results of the study emphasize the role of the reticuloendothelial system in the modulation of immune complex localization in the kidney and suggest a potential use of stimulants of the reticuloendothelial system in the therapy of immune complex nephritis...|$|R

(1993) Nucleic Acids Res. 21, 5323 - 5327) {{presented}} {{evidence of an}} activity in HeLa cell nuclear extracts that released <b>radiolabeled</b> <b>material</b> from a poly(dG. dC) polymer that had been methylated and simultaneously labeled on cytosine residues by incubation with a CpG-specific DNA methylase and [methyl- 3 H]S-adenosylmethionine. Based on chromatographic evidence that the released products were thymine and 5 -methylcytosine and on f 1 p 4 olabeling data suggesting a concomitant increase in abasic sites, the authors concluded that the releasing activity was a 5 -methylcytosine-specific glycosylase and that the solubilized 5 -methylcytosine was converted to thymine by a nuclear deaminase. We have confirmed that HeLa nuclear extracts promote release of ethanol-soluble radioactivity from a methyl-labeled poly(dG- 5 -methyl-dC) polymer, but the products released were neither 5 -methylcytosine nor thymine. Furthermore, free 5 -methylcytosine was not deaminated by incubation with the nuclear extract. The labeled compound released initially from the polymer appeared to be 5 -methyl-deoxycytidine monophosphate, which was converted to 5 -methyl-deoxycytidine, thymidine monophosphate, and/or thymidine by further incubation with the nuclear extract. The activity responsible for the release, therefore, was a nuclease. Release of 32 P-labeled nucleotides from a 32 P-labeled poly(dG-dC) polymer suggested, furthermore, that the activity was not specific for methylated DNA...|$|R
