2500|$|This {{design of}} {{incinerator}} has 2 chambers: a primary chamber and secondary chamber. [...] The primary chamber in a rotary kiln incinerator {{consists of an}} inclined refractory lined cylindrical tube. The inner <b>refractory</b> <b>lining</b> serves as sacrificial layer to protect the kiln structure. This refractory layer needs to be replaced from time to time. Movement of the cylinder on its axis facilitates movement of waste. In the primary chamber, there is conversion of solid fraction to gases, through volatilization, destructive distillation and partial combustion reactions. The secondary chamber is necessary to complete gas phase combustion reactions.|$|E

50|$|Unless the ladle {{is to be}} {{used with}} alloys that have very low {{temperature}} melting point, the ladle is also fitted with a <b>refractory</b> <b>lining.</b> It is the <b>refractory</b> <b>lining</b> that stops the steel vessel from suffering damage when the ladle is used to transport metals with high melting temperatures that, if the molten metal came in direct contact with the ladle shell, would rapidly melt through the shell. <b>Refractory</b> <b>lining</b> materials come in many forms and the right choice very much depends on each foundry's working practices. Traditionally ladles used to be lined using pre-cast firebricks however refractory concretes have tended to supersede these in many countries.|$|E

A slag hole, located higher up on the {{cylinder}} of the furnace, and usually to the rear or side of the tap hole, is opened to let the slag flow out. The viscosity is low (with proper fluxing) and the red hot molten slag will flow easily. Sometimes the slag which runs out the slag hole is collected in a small cup shaped tool, allowed to cool and harden. It is fractured and visually examined. With acid <b>refractory</b> <b>lined</b> cupolas a greenish colored slag means the fluxing is proper and adequate. In basic <b>refractory</b> <b>lined</b> cupolas the slag is brown.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperature}} requirements for FR operations, a <b>refractory</b> <b>lining</b> is required to reinforce and maintain vessel integrity over time. Also, a <b>refractory</b> <b>lining</b> serves to isolate the chamber’s high temperature from ambient temperature. For example, in the Reco-Dust process, the FR is lined with two separate refractory materials: aluminum oxide bricks for the combustion chamber, and silicon carbide bricks for the conical outlet part. In addition, design of the vessel can vary in shapes and sizes (i.e. from pipeline to an egg-like shape) that aims to promote the vertical circulation of the gases and particulate matter.|$|E
50|$|The {{products}} of combustion left the chamber and {{passed through a}} narrow ceramic neck which reached temperatures of 2000 degrees F where the gases and tars released by the wood completed their burning. The products then passed through a <b>refractory</b> <b>lined</b> ash chamber which slowed the flow and let ash settle out. From here the hot gases travelled up through the boiler tubes which pass through the water jacket. Turbulators in the tubes improve heat transfer to the water jacket.|$|R
50|$|The furnace used {{a forced}} and {{induced draft fan}} to draw {{combustion}} air and exhaust gases through the combustion chamber at 1/3 {{of the speed of}} sound (100 m/s+). The wood was loaded into a vertical tube which passed through the water jacket into a <b>refractory</b> <b>lined</b> combustion chamber. In this chamber the burning took place and was limited {{to the ends of the}} logs. The water jacket prevented the upper parts of the logs from burning so they would gravity feed as the log was consumed.|$|R

A first way to increase energy efficiency is to substitute mains frequency (50  Hz) furnaces with medium frequency (up to 250  Hz) ones. The latters have a higher power density (up to 1, 000  kW t− 1) than the formers (300  kW t− 1). This allows {{the use of a}} smaller crucible (up to a factor of three smaller) which results in a smaller total heat loss. The thermal efficiency of medium frequency furnaces is 10  % higher than for the mains frequency types [14].|$|R
