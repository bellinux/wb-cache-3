The design of landfill membranes is at such low volumes that they should never have a measurable adverse impact {{on the quality of}} the <b>receiving</b> <b>groundwater.</b> A more significant risk may be the failure or abandonment of the leachate collection system. Such systems are prone to internal failure as landfills suffer large internal movements as waste decomposes unevenly and thus buckles and distorts pipes. If a leachate collection system fails, leachate levels will slowly build in a site and may even over-top the containing membrane and flow out into the environment. Rising leachate levels can also wet waste masses that have previously been dry, triggering further active decomposition and leachate generation. Thus, what appears to be a stabilised and inactive site can become re-activated and restart significant gas production and exhibit significant changes in finished ground levels.|$|E

The classification of other hydrologic function types had lower accuracies reducing the overall accuracy for the four hydrologic function classes to 51 %.

We {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments, coupling seepage meters directly to phytoplankton enclosure experiments to determine the impacts of groundwater-borne nutrients on biomass and response in community structure of phytoplankton. To assess the impacts of groundwater-borne nutrients, we measured chlorophyll a concentrations as a proxy for overall biomass and used genetic sequencing techniques to characterize the phytoplankton community structure. Groundwater carried a high N load to the estuary with NO 3 - up to 295 µmol/L, and NH 4 + up to 55 µmol/L. As a result treatment mesocosms had NO 3 - concentrations up to 55. 5 µmol/L and NH 4 + up to 4. 0 µmol/L, while control mesocosms received filtered seawater, and were thus relatively low in nutrients (24. 2 µmol/L NO 3 - and ∼ 2 µmol/L NH 4 +). In June the highest chlorophyll a concentrations occurred after 3. 5 days, with significant differences between control mesocosms (4. 3 ± 0. 2 mg/L), groundwater amended mesocosms (7. 0 ± 0. 6 mg/L), and mesocosms <b>receiving</b> <b>groundwater</b> across the sediment-water interface (10. 9 ± 0. 2 mg/L). In August, biomass peaked after 3 days and showed larger variation across treatment groups with groundwater amended mesocosms reaching significantly higher values (36. 6 ± 2. 0 mg/L) than mesocosms <b>receiving</b> <b>groundwater</b> across the sediment-water interface (18. 7 ± 4. 8 mg/L), which showed significantly different values than both controls and phosphate amended mesocosms (11. 9 ± 0. 7 and 9. 9 ± 0. 2 mg/L respectively). Community gene sequence data showed that species assemblage was also impacted by availability of nutrients, with significant differences in community structure for mesocosms receiving nutrients vs control mesocosms in both June and August experiments. Several harmful algal species also proliferated in high nutrient treatments, including Cylindrotheca closterium, Karlodinium veneficum, Nitzschia ovalis, and Heterocapsa sp.

In Western Europe especially soligenous fens, <b>receiving</b> <b>groundwater,</b> {{are threatened by}} human hydrological intervention. We demonstrate the impact of artificial versus natural hydrologies on such fens by comparing 3 case areas: the Biebrza valley (reference) and the Gorecht and Vecht river plains (both reclaimed and drained). The patterns found in the fairly undisturbed Biebrza area suggest local water quality is governed by a strong regional groundwater flow emerging in the fen near the valley margins and seeping through {{it down to the}} river. Hence water quality gradients are smooth: there is little variation in water type over large distances. The pattern is determined by the natural geomorphology. In the reclaimed Vecht and Gorecht river plains large differences exist at short distance. Regional water flow from the adjacent ridges into the plains is weak here and governed primarily by water management (polders and pumping wells). However, the relations between specific water types and fen species and communities in this artificial pattern are quite similar to those found in the natural landscape. Low-productive rich fens are fed by calcium-rich and base-rich, nutrient-poor groundwater in both cases. While conservation of such rich fens is served best by maintaining the natural groundwater flow, some opportunities for restoration with an artificial hydrology are discussed...|$|E

An alternative routing function employs a transfer function that is discretely-coincident to a cascade of two linear reservoirs in series.

This could further explain recent HD salinity increases corresponding to increasing PET/T and decreasing rainfall. The local warming is crucial as, T and ET are highest in wet months hence more water losses (Ibid). This is especially worrisome since wind, another factor driving ET, is also highest during wet months and local rains are often interrupted by strong sunhours (Ibid).

Unstable and less protective corrosion scale {{is one of the}} main factors causing "discolored water" issues when quality of water entering into distribution system changed significantly. The morphological and physicochemical characteristics of corrosion scales formed under different source water histories in duration of about two decades were systematically investigated in this work. Thick corrosion scales or densely distributed corrosion tubercles were mostly found in pipes transporting surface water, but thin corrosion scales and hollow tubercles were mostly discovered in pipes transporting groundwater. Magnetite and goethite were main constituents of iron corrosion products, but the mass ratio of magnetite/goethite (WG) was significantly different depending on the corrosion scale structure and water source conditions. Thick corrosion scales and hard shell of tubercles had much higher WG ratio (> 1. 0), while the thin corrosion scales had no magnetite detected or with much lower WG ratio. The WG ratio could be used to identify the characteristics and evaluate the performances of corrosion scales formed under different water conditions. Compared with the pipes transporting ground water, the pipes transporting surface water were more seriously corroded and could be in a relatively more active corrosion status all the time, which was implicated by relatively higher siderite, green rust and total iron contents in their corrosion scales. Higher content of unstable ferric components such as gamma-FeOOH, beta-FeOOH and amorphous iron oxide existed in corrosion scales of pipes <b>receiving</b> <b>groundwater</b> which was less corroded.

40|$|Radon (222 Rn) {{and major}} ion {{geochemistry}} {{were used to}} define and quantify the catchment-scale groundwater-surface water interactions along the Ovens River in the southeast Murray–Darling Basin, Victoria, Australia, between September 2009 and October 2011. The Ovens River {{is characterized by the}} transition from a single channel within a mountain valley in the upper catchment to a multi-channel meandering river on flat alluvial plains in the lower catchment. Overall, the Ovens River is dominated by gaining reaches, <b>receiving</b> <b>groundwater</b> from both alluvial and basement aquifers. The distribution of gaining and losing reaches is governed by catchment morphology and lithology. In the upper catchment, rapid groundwater recharge through the permeable aquifers increases the water table. The rising water table, referred to as hydraulic loading, increases the hydraulic head gradient toward the river and hence causes high baseflow to the river during wet (high flow) periods. In the lower catchment, lower rainfall and finer-gained sediments reduce the magnitude and variability of hydraulic gradient between the aquifer and the river, producing lower but more constant groundwater inflows. The water table in the lower reaches has a shallow gradient, and small changes in river height or groundwater level can result in fluctuating gaining and losing behaviour. The middle catchment represents a transition in river-aquifer interactions from the upper to the lower catchment. High baseflow {{in some parts of the}} middle and lower catchments is caused by groundwater flowing over basement highs. Mass balance calculations based on 222 Rn activities indicate that groundwater inflows are 2 to 17 % of total flow with higher inflows occurring during high flow periods. In comparison to 222 Rn activities, estimates of groundwater inflows from Cl concentrations are higher by up to 2000 % in the upper and middle catchment but lower by 50 to 100 % in the lower catchment. The high baseflow estimates using Cl concentrations may be due to the lack of sufficient difference between groundwater and surface water Cl concentrations. Both hydrograph separation and differential flow gauging yield far higher baseflow fluxes than 222 Rn activities and Cl concentrations, probably indicating the input of other sources to the river in additional to regional groundwater, such as bank return flows...|$|E

The {{impact of these}} constituents of interest (CIs) on <b>receiving</b> <b>groundwater</b> systems {{and the potential for}} their natural attenuation is investigated. A 10. 7 km 2 mine-impacted research catchment (West Line Creek) was instrumented with 13 monitoring wells and 8 drivepoint wells to characterize the hydraulics and geochemistry of the aquifer system downgradient of the waste rock dump. These data were augmented with geophysical surveys and by characterizing the lithology, geotechnical properties, and geochemistry of core samples obtained during drilling. Furthermore, the groundwater monitoring program also facilitated the development of a conceptual model of hydrogeology in a small montane valley. 	An unconfined aquifer at the overburden/fractured bedrock interface, i. e. the basal alluvial aquifer was identified as the primary groundwater conduit for the migration of water and solutes from the waste rock dump toward Line Creek. Vertical and horizontal dispersion of CIs was confirmed with porewater analysis of core samples, with Se concentrations exceeding the BC water quality guideline (2. 0 µg/L) in 98 % of samples (n = 223). Residence time for groundwater in the overburden aquifers was determined using 3 H/ 3 He age dating (n = 3) and estimates of groundwater velocity to be less than three years across the 650 m study site. The chemistry of groundwater was compared with rock drain water samples to evaluate CIs from their source through to identified discharge locations. Linear correlation of CI concentrations with SO 42 - concentrations in water samples showed that Se and NO 3 - were conservative solutes, whereas Cd was non-conservative and may be undergoing mineral precipitation or adsorption reactions in the groundwater system. The distribution of CIs in the overburden aquifers was seasonally variable and dilution was determined to be the dominant mechanism controlling the concentrations of conservative CIs (Se, SO 42 - and NO 3 -) away from the toe of the waste rock dump and during the spring freshet.

40|$|Groundwater flow {{typically}} provides stable stream habitat within glacierised floodplains. However, spatio-temporal {{differences within}} and between groundwater flow pathways can create marked variability in the physicochemical characteristics of groundwater-fed streams. Research conducted on a floodplain terrace of the Toklat River, Denali National Park, Alaska, predominantly from May to September 2008, determined the influence of groundwater flow dynamics upon benthic and hyporheic macroinvertebrate assemblages. During periods of resource depletion benthic macroinvertebrate abundance was dependent upon contributions from specific flow pathways (DFSdeep), which supplied fine particulate organic matter. Dynamics of groundwater flow pathways influenced macroinvertebrates throughout the summer, however, with higher diversity observed in perennial streams which <b>received</b> <b>groundwater</b> flow from DFSdeep. Ephemeral flow pathways of glacial seepage supported lower diversity. Within the hyporheic zone, environmental stability of surface waters was influential, as this reflected the sub-surface residence time of percolating waters; nested routes of flow within each flow pathway, of varying length or permeability, created differences in the environmental stability of each stream. Macroinvertebrate diversity in the hyporheic zone was higher at sites of lower surface environmental stability, suggesting possible migration into the hyporheic zone.

The mire-rich Kalix River drainage basin was chosen as a typical northern shield area because this river may represent typical waters flowing into the Arctic and northern seas. Groundwaters from bedrock and glacial tills have comparable Th isotope concentrations and do not exhibit significant Th isotopic shifts relative to host rocks. The extensive peat deposits of the basin <b>receive</b> <b>groundwater</b> discharges and concentrate Th and U (but not Ba and Ra), which cause high 230 Th/ 232 Th ratios in mire waters.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScIn the Kruger National Park (KNP) {{which is}} the {{flagship}} conservation area in South Africa, the impact on groundwater should be {{kept to a minimum}} as groundwater plays a vital role in sustaining ecosystem functioning and sustaining baseflow to streams and rivers. For this reason groundwater has been {{recognized as one of the}} environmental indicators that need to be monitored. The KNP has adopted a Strategic Adaptive Management (SAM) approach with clear ecosystem management goals. The achievement of these goals is evaluated by using environmental indicators. These indicators are evaluated against thresholds of potential concern (TPC). TPCs are a set of boundaries that together define the spatiotemporal conditions for which the KNP ecosystem is managed. TPCs are essentially upper and lower limits along a continuum of change in selected environmental indicators. Historically, groundwater recharge and surface water interaction with rivers has tended to be overlooked in the KNP. This study proposes a conceptual model of groundwater recharge processes in the KNP, defining when and how groundwater recharge occurs. Two methods were used, the Cumulative Rainfall Departure (CRD) and stable isotopes of ²H and ¹⁸O. An adapted version of the CRD which incorporates a long and short term memory of the system was used to identify possible recharge processes. Further, using the CRD method a reliable reconstruction of the long term groundwater level trends are simulated using monthly rainfall totals with reference to the average rainfall over the entire time series 1936 - 2009. The stable isotope of ²H and ¹⁸O samples from cumulative rainfall samplers, surfacewater (streams and rivers) and groundwater from boreholes were collected monthly for approximately one year (May 2010 to July 2011). The isotope composition of the groundwater was used to establish whether recharge was immediate or delayed. Additionally, the isotopic composition of surface-water from rivers and streams were compared to that of groundwater to identify surface-water interactions. Groundwater recharge in KNP occurs during the rainy summer months (December to March) and very little to none during the dry winter season (April to September). Recharge takes place during rainfall sequences 100 mm or more. The stable isotope records collected from cumulative rainfall, groundwater and surface water (streams and rivers) indicate that groundwater experiences evaporation prior to infiltration. As the KNP experiences high evaporation rates, insignificant rainfall sequences contribute little or zero to recharge. The CRD analysis of groundwater level fluctuations shows that recharge to the aquifers respond to dry and wet cycles that last for 6 to 14 years. The KNP experienced several periods of below-average rainfall and hence no significant recharge took place to the basement aquifers. During a normal rainy season the water levels rise somewhat then starts receding again. It is only during major rainfall events that may occur every 100 yrs to 200 yrs causing the aquifers to fully recharge. This was perfectly illustrated by the high groundwater levels after the 2000 major rainfall event that recharged the aquifers fully. During below average rainfall years the overall water level trend is drastically declining. The system experiences higher natural losses than gains due to outflow of groundwater to streams and rivers. The KNP is divided down the center by two geological formations, granites along the west and basalts along the east. The combination of the CRD model and the stable isotopic analysis suggest that the dominant recharge processes that occur in the southern region of the KNP are direct recharge via piston flow and indirect recharge via preferred pathways particularly streams and rivers. Along the eastern half of the KNP on the Basalts and Rhyolite direct recharge via piston flow are dominant. Groundwater is not recharged via small streams and rivers (Sweni and Mnondozi Rivers) as it was found that at these particular sites these rivers are detached and do not interact with groundwater. Along the western granitic areas the dominant recharge process are indirect recharge. Recharge takes place via preferred pathways particularly streams and rivers. It was found that ephemeral rivers (Nwatsisonto River) act as sinks for groundwater recharge and influent-effluent conditions are experienced along seasonal rivers (Mbyamiti River). The large perennial Sabie and its tributary the Sand River are consistently fed by groundwater, above all maintaining base flow during the dry season. These rivers act as basin sinks <b>receiving</b> <b>groundwater</b> discharge all year round. Using the stable isotope composition of rainfall, surface-water and groundwater to act as a natural tracer, in combination with the CRD method proved invaluable to confirm the plausible recharge processes. The study provided a conceptual understanding of the groundwater system in the KNP forming the foundation to developing acceptable limits (TPCs) of the groundwater levels in the KNP. The model will serve as a guide for the recharge processes and for deciding on the location and time frames for data collection to ultimately set TPCs for groundwater in the KNP to sustainably manage the resource...|$|E

Water quality was monitored in Topanga Creek and in surface discharge from 20 springs on a monthly basis from April to December 2005. Instream habitat mapping and monthly snorkel surveys were also conducted to determine whether steelhead preferentially selected habitat units with groundwater. Sixteen percent of habitat units in the Topanga Creek study area <b>received</b> <b>groundwater</b> from known springs. For six out of the nine months of the study, significantly more trout were found in groundwater areas than would be expected by the frequency of such sites. The most likely reason for steelhead to select habitat units with groundwater during this study was differences in habitat between areas with and without groundwater. Habitat units with groundwater had characteristics that were more favorable for steelhead such as greater surface area, greater depth, and higher shelter value. Habitat units with groundwater may also have acted as refugia from high stream temperatures. While {{there was no significant difference}} between temperature of the creek and temperature of surface discharge from springs, deep pools were significantly cooler than shallow pools.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Although {{millions}} of dollars are spent restoring wetlands, failures are common, {{in part because the}} planted vegetation cannot survive in the restored hydrology. Wetland restoration would be more successful if the hydrologic requirements of wetland plant communities were known so that the most appropriate plants could be selected for the range of projected hydrology at the site. Here we describe how hydrologic models can be used to characterize the long‐term hydrology of wetland plant communities, and we show how these results can be used to define wetland design criteria. In our study, we quantified differences in long‐term (40 ‐year) hydrologic characteristics of the pond pine woodland (PPW), nonriverine swamp forest (NRSF), high pocosin (HP), and bay forest (BF) plant communities native to the North Carolina Coastal Plain. We found that the median water level was 8 cm below the land surface in PPW and 9, 2, and 8 cm above the land surface for NRSF, HP, and BF, respectively. When the land surface was inundated, the median duration of inundation was 91 d year‐ 1 for PPW and 317, 243, and 307 d year‐ 1 for NRSF, HP, and BF, respectively. Our models suggested that the PPW received an average of 15 % of its water input from groundwater inflow, whereas the other communities we modeled did not appear to <b>receive</b> <b>groundwater</b> inflow. Using these results and soil organic layer thickness, we developed and propose design criteria linking soil, vegetation, and hydrology parameters that should contribute to improved restoration success...|$|R
40|$|In {{areas where}} peatlands are abundant, {{they are likely}} to play a {{significant}} role in the hydrological and hydrogeological dynamics of a watershed. Although individual case studies are reported in the literature, there is a large range of aquifer–peatland interactions and there is a need to understand the controls of these interactions. The objectives of this study were (1) to better understand aquifer–peatland connections and how these may be predicted by geology and geomorphic location and (2) to provide a variety of reference sites for glacial geological settings. Slope and depression peatlands were studied in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region and in the St. Lawrence Lowlands, two contrasting regions of southern Quebec. A total of 12 transects that span a shallow aquifer–peatland interface were instrumented with piezometers. Field investigations included peatland characterization, monthly water level monitoring, and continuous hydraulic head measurements with pressure transducers. The results indicate that 7 of the 12 transects <b>receive</b> <b>groundwater</b> from the surrounding shallow aquifer. At the peatland margin, four lateral flow patterns were identified and associated with slope peatlands (parallel inflow and divergent flow) and with depression peatlands (convergent flow and parallel outflow). Vertical hydraulic gradients suggest that water flows mainly downwards, i. e. from the peatland to the underlying mineral deposits. Vertical connectivity appears to decrease as the distance from the peatland margin increases. All of these exchanges are important components in the sustainability of peatland hydrogeological functions. The regional comparison of aquifer–peatland flow dynamics performed in this study provides a new set of referenced data for the assessment of aquifer–peatland connectivity...|$|R

Gradual pollution of water in Europa over the past decades have resulted in a water management across country boarders and increased the need for research in running waters. Freshwater research has gained important knowledge through experiments in artificial streams. Results from artificial streams may not be comparable with processes in nature, but replication and flume design improve data strength. In this thesis, eight artificial streams were constructed of stainless steel with bottom substrate of coarse gravel. Water was circulated separately for each flume. Tiles and leaves were exposed for six weeks at different longitudinal positions in each flume. It was tested if periphyton colonized the tiles differently between the flumes or between the positions in each flume, and if leaf litter degraded differently between the flumes or between the positions in each flume. Two different sampling methods were used. There were no differences between the sampling methods, which indicate that removal of random tiles and leaf litter bags did not affect the remaining tiles. There were no differences in leaf litter degradation between the flumes or between the positions in a flume. Similarly, there were no differences in colonization of algae on tiles between the flumes or positions in each flume, so neither the location of the flume nor the longitudinal position within the flume affected litter degradation or algal growth. However, algal density in Flume 1 differed from that of the other flumes. Flume 1 <b>received</b> <b>groundwater</b> while the other flumes were filled with surface water. Different water quality may be the reason why Flume 1 had different algal assemblage as well as less leaf litter degradation, than the other flumes. It was concluded that the artificial streams at Solbergstrand were suited for future experiments and they may well contribute to our further knowledge on how to keep freshwater healthy and clean...|$|R

All of these chemicals may derive from the former phenol manufacturing activities present at the Industri-Plex site during World War I. Concentrations up to 1660 microgram/l benzene, 450 micro/l DPS, 230 microgram/l PPP, and 100 microgram/l OPP were detected in the hypolimnion. Epilimnetic concentrations of the chemicals were significantly lower (normally < 5 microgram/l). DPS showed a distinct seasonal behavior: It was readily biodegradable during warm periods. No biodegradation was observed in the winter, leaving export to the Aberjona River as the major removal mechanism.

40|$|How much {{groundwater}} {{flows to}} boreal streams {{depends on the}} relative contributions from each landscape unit (forested uplands, lakes, and peatlands) within a catchment along with its hydrogeologic setting. Although there is {{an understanding of the}} hydrologic processes that regulate groundwater outputs from individual landscape units to their underlying aquifers (both coarse- and fine-textured) in the boreal forest, less understood is how the topography, typology, and topology (i. e. hydrologic connectivity) of the landscape units regulates groundwater flow to streams. Improved understanding of groundwater-stream interactions in the Boreal Plain of Alberta and Saskatchewan is critical as this region is undergoing substantial environmental change from land cover disturbances for energy and forestry industries and climate change. This thesis determines groundwater-stream interactions during the autumn low-flow period in a 97 km 2 glacial outwash sub-catchment of White Gull Creek Research Basin, Boreal Ecosystem Research and Modelling Site, Saskatchewan. The catchment (Pine Fen Creek) is comprised of a large (30 km 2) valley-bottom peatland, two lakes, and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) uplands. The pine uplands are important areas of annual groundwater recharge for the catchment. Vertical hydraulic gradients (VHGs) show frequent flow reversals between the lakes and sand aquifer, and spatially diverse VHGs between the peatland and sand aquifer. Groundwater flow nets and lateral hydraulic gradients indicate the stream <b>receives</b> <b>groundwater</b> along its length. Isotopic samples of end members corroborate the hydrometric data. Catchment streamflow response during the 2011 low flow period was not simply the addition of net groundwater inputs from each landscape unit. Instead, the large size, valley-bottom position, and short water ‘memory’ of the peatland were the critical factors in regulation of catchment streamflow during low flow periods. Peatland hydrologic function alternated between a source and sink of runoff (surface and subsurface) to the stream, dependent on the position of the water table; a value of 0. 15 m below peat surface was the critical functional tipping point. Given the high percentage of peatlands (21 %) within the Boreal Plain, incorporating their runoff threshold is required in parameterizing runoff generation in hydrological models, and thus predicting impacts of peatland degradation and forest clearing on streamflow...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} of Th, Ra, and ^(210) Pb from a continental source region and through an estuarine environment was investigated. Unlike previous studies, here both short- and long-lived nuclide {{data were obtained}} for river inputs, river water, and estuarine waters. The mire-rich Kalix River drainage basin was chosen as a typical northern shield area because this river may represent typical waters flowing into the Arctic and northern seas. Groundwaters from bedrock and glacial tills have comparable Th isotope concentrations and do not exhibit significant Th isotopic shifts relative to host rocks. The extensive peat deposits of the basin <b>receive</b> <b>groundwater</b> discharges and concentrate Th and U (but not Ba and Ra), which cause high ^(230) Th/^(232) Th ratios in mire waters. However, mire outflows {{do not have a}} significant impact on Th and Ra isotopic compositions of the river. Overall weathering characteristics for the basin are obtained from the river data. The ^(230) Th/^(232) Th, ^(228) Ra/^(226) Ra, and ^(226) Ra/Ba river ratios are comparable to those of source rocks, consistent with similar release rates of these nuclides from U-, Th-, and Ba-bearing minerals. River ratios of (^(230) Th/^(238) U) _(AR) and (^(226) Ra/^(238) U) _(AR) are < 1, so that Th and possibly Ra are accumulating in the weathering regions, and the weathering profile is still evolving. Low (^(228) Ra/^(232) Th) _(AR) and (^(226) Ra/^(230) Th) ^(AR) ratios indicate that Th is preferentially retained over Ra. River (^(234) Th/^(238) U) _(AR) ratios are greater than (^(230) Th/^(238) U) _(AR) ratios and suggest that in systems where river inputs are well characterized, these ratios can be used to calculate Th transit times through the watershed. Filtration data indicate that although a dominant fraction of the Th is transported in the river on particles, the rest is almost entirely carried by colloids. The Kalix River discharges into the Baltic Sea. Model calculations for the {{transport of}} Th and Ra isotopes in the Baltic Sea show that the high ratios of (^(234) Th/^(238) U) _(AR) found here reflect long Th residence times relative to particle scavenging of ∼ 50 d. The water column ^(232) Th budget is dominated by eolian inputs. The ^(226) Ra concentrations may be higher than those of water inflows, with ≤ 60...|$|R
