Moreover, recent neuroimaging studies have <b>reveled</b> similarities <b>in</b> hemodynamic patterns between motor imagery and movement execution as well as motor imagery and movement observation. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate differences in hemodynamic responses among these three conditions, pointing out the contribution of motor areas. We used a fNIRS event related paradigm in co-registration with EEG. Healthy right-handed participants were asked either to imagine, observe or execute right hand movements. During the tasks, changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin were recorded in the left fronto-central, central and parietal areas with fNIRS (24 channel - 8 detectors and 8 injectors). Cerebral activity was simultaneously recorded by EEG. Data analyses showed variations in hemodynamic responses across the conditions, with significant similarities between motor imagery and movement observation. Therefore, the present results showed that differences in hemodynamic profiles are congruent with the type of motor task. Specifically changes in hemodynamic responses within motor areas mirror the specific role of cortical areas underpinning the tasks. Moreover, there are preliminary evidences of a congruent modulation of EEG data in relation with hemodynamic data...|$|R

Methods. A total of 340 community participants from Sichuan Province, Mainland China involved in the study, most of which experienced Wenchuan and Lushan Earthquake. Participants were required to complete the self-reported questionnaire packages at one time point for obtaining their scores on virtues (Chinese Virtues Questionnaire), PTSD (PTSD Checklist-Specific), and PTG (Post-traumatic Growth Inventory-Chinese). Results. Significant and positive correlations between the three virtues and PTG were identified (r =. 39 –. 56; p <. 01). Further regression analysis by stepwise method <b>reveled</b> that: <b>in</b> the indirect trauma samples, vitality explained 32 % variance of PTG. In reference to the direct trauma sample without PTSD, both relationship and conscientiousness explained 32 % variance of PTG, whereas in the direct trauma sample with PTSD, only conscientiousness accounted for 31 % the variance in PTG.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a survey questionnaire, data were collected against forty one supply chain management skills.

These are supply chain general management (SCG) skill-category, supply chain analytical (SCA) skill-category, supply chain information technology (SCIT) skill-category, and supply chain environmental-related (SCE) skill-category. Subsequently, the importance-performance matrix (IPM) analysis was conducted to these higher level skill-categories to assess {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the offered skills as perceived by the respondents.
