5|$|A {{third major}} pulse brought the lahar's {{duration}} to roughly two hours. By that point, 85percent of Armero was enveloped in mud.

5|$|For {{short-range}} missile (throwing) weapons, a Roman infantryman {{would probably}} had either a long throwing-spear {{or two or}} three short javelins (lanceae) and half a dozen plumbatae (weighted darts) with an effective range of about 30m. Ammianus talks of a variety of missiles being thrown by the Alamanni in the battle: spicula (a kind of long pilum-type javelin, also known as an angon), verruta missilia (short throwing-spears) and ferratae arundines (probably darts and franciscas: throwing-axes). Overall, there appears little difference in the throwing-missile capability of the contenders. Ammianus indicates that the Roman infantry ranks were obliged to hold their shields above their heads for much of the time due to the volume of missiles <b>raining</b> <b>down</b> on them.|$|E

25|$|Sagan {{was among}} the first to hypothesize that Saturn's moon Titan might possess oceans of liquid {{compounds}} on its surface and that Jupiter's moon Europa might possess subsurface oceans of water. This would make Europa potentially habitable. Europa's subsurface ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft Galileo. The mystery of Titan's reddish haze was also solved with Sagan's help. The reddish haze was revealed to be due to complex organic molecules constantly <b>raining</b> <b>down</b> onto Titan's surface.|$|E
25|$|As {{noted in}} The Gypsy Moth (1896) by Forbush and Fernald, the gypsy moth was {{considered}} a nuisance just ten years after their release.

At first it was uncertain what species {{was responsible for the}} outbreak, but after the caterpillar was identified by entomologist Maria Elizabeth Fernald, an eradication program began in 1890.|$|E

25|$|At 15:08, , moored at Tare 8, exploded, {{sending a}} large {{fireball}} into the sky. The noise was heard miles away at Pearl Harbor Headquarters. More explosions of increasing intensity followed, sparking {{fears of a}} Japanese attack or even an earthquake. Fire and debris <b>raining</b> <b>down</b> on the fuel and munitions stored on the decks of other LSTs had caused an explosive chain reaction. Within minutes, 200 men had been blown into the water. Eleven wooden buildings on the shore were destroyed and vehicles blown on their side. In all, 20 buildings were damaged.|$|E
25|$|Search and {{recovery}} operations {{were conducted by}} federal, state, and local agencies, as well as government contractors. An HH-60 helicopter of the New York Air National Guard saw the explosion from approximately eight miles away, and arrived on scene so quickly that debris was still <b>raining</b> <b>down,</b> and the aircraft had to pull away. They reported their sighting to the tower at Suffolk County Airport (now Gabreski ANG Base). Remote-operated vehicles (ROVs), side-scan sonar, and laser line-scanning equipment were used to search for and investigate underwater debris fields. Victims and wreckage were recovered by scuba divers and ROVs; later scallop trawlers were used to recover wreckage embedded in the ocean floor. In {{one of the largest}} diver-assisted salvage operations ever conducted, often working in very difficult and dangerous conditions, over 95% of the airplane wreckage was eventually recovered. The search {{and recovery}} effort identified three main areas of wreckage underwater. The yellow zone, red zone, and green zone contained wreckage from front, center, and rear sections of the airplane, respectively. The green zone with the aft portion of the aircraft was located the furthest along the flight path.|$|E

After five more minutes of shelling, Nürnberg struck her colors, and Kents crew prepared to lower lifeboats to pick up survivors.|$|E

Large amounts fell upon the Franklin, starting fires which caused the arms locker to explode and set fire to the poop and quarterdeck.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said he {{was surprised}} by the complexity of [...] "200" [...] and the amount of South Park references and subplots it encompassed, especially the questions over Cartman's father. Tucker praised the episode, and said, [...] "With jokes <b>raining</b> <b>down</b> like hell-fire, the 200th episode spared no one except the South Park kids themselves." [...] Ramsey Isler of IGN said it was fun to identify all the references to past South Park moments, but felt [...] "200" [...] itself didn't stand out as a great episode. Isler said the new material wasn't very funny, and that the rehashed material was not as funny as the first time they were shown, which was disappointing due to the hype surrounding the episode. The A.V. Club writer Sean O'Neal said the episode was funny, but that the original material was far outnumbered by rehashed jokes. O'Neal said the use of all the celebrities demonstrated how South Park had been more original in early episodes, but now had [...] "morph into something whose default mode is mocking famous people in the news".|$|E

2500|$|At about 08:00 on 19 June, {{he raised}} his periscope and {{found himself in the}} midst of Ozawa's main body. Blanchard, with astounding aplomb {{considering}} how juicy the target was, allowed one Japanese carrier to pass unharmed and selected a second one for his target at 9,000yards (8,200m). Waiting while a destroyer passed before his sights, he saw his TDC had gone awry, so at 5,300yards (4,850m) he fired six bow tubes by eye. Three Japanese destroyers immediately charged Albacore, and Blanchard dived. While on the way down, he heard (and felt) one solid hit, correctly timed for his last torpedo. About the same time, 25 depth charges began <b>raining</b> <b>down</b> on the submarine, some so close the cork insulation was shaken loose.
