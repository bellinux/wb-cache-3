25|$|The popular {{conception}} of the Bauhaus {{as the source of}} extensive Weimar-era working housing is not accurate. Two projects, the apartment building project in Dessau and the Törten <b>row</b> <b>housing</b> also in Dessau, fall in that category, but developing worker housing was not the first priority of Gropius nor Mies. It was the Bauhaus contemporaries Bruno Taut, Hans Poelzig and particularly Ernst May, as the city architects of Berlin, Dresden and Frankfurt respectively, who are rightfully credited with the thousands of socially progressive housing units built in Weimar Germany. The housing Taut built in south-west Berlin during the 1920s, close to the U-Bahn stop Onkel Toms Hütte, is still occupied.|$|E

5000|$|Project <b>Row</b> <b>Houses,</b> {{conceived}} and founded by artist Rick Lowe {{together with a}} group of African American artists and community activists, rescued and rehabilitated a series of shotgun-style houses in Houston’s Third Ward, one of the city’s oldest African American communities. Installations, exhibitions, and performances were programmed in the houses, some of which also became a residential program for young, single mothers [...] The opening of Project <b>Row</b> <b>Houses</b> was preceded by the Drive-By Show, which invited artists to paint on the plywood temporarily covering the windows of the <b>row</b> <b>houses</b> facing Holman Street. Project <b>Row</b> <b>Houses</b> has grown from the original 23 shotgun houses on 2 blocks to about 50 buildings on 8 blocks. Project <b>Row</b> <b>Houses</b> is internationally recognized and Michael Kimmelman of the New York Times said that Project <b>Row</b> <b>Houses</b> [...] "may be the most impressive and visionary public art project in the country." [...] In 1999 Project <b>Row</b> <b>Houses</b> partnered with the School of Architecture at Rice University to build low-income housing. By the end of 2010 Project <b>Row</b> <b>Houses</b> will be housing over 75 residents. The art installations continue in six-month cycles.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{parts of}} {{construction}} started in February 1956 at Rødtvet. Most of the earthwork was concluded by early 1964 on the [...] section from Hasle to Grorud. This included building a 37-million-kroner tunnel under Ring 3 and the Alna Line. The {{construction of the}} Grorud Line ran parallel with a large-scale residential construction along the line, especially on the upper sections. Commuter towns {{with a mix of}} <b>row</b> <b>housing,</b> condominiums and high-rises were built along the line, often concentrating close to the stations. Some also received small shopping centers.|$|E
2500|$|Construction of the Sognsvann Line {{started in}} 1933. It and Kringsjå Station were opened on 10 October 1934.

Unlike further south along the line there was not as much construction of housing. The area around Kringsjå was mostly developed from the 1960s. Until 1970 there was a café at the station. Kringsjå Student City opened in 1970, followed by Fjellbirkeland Student City in 1990.

While newer homes are scattered throughout the city, much of the housing is from the early 20th century or older.
