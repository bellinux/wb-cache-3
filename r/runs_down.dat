5|$|A stream issuing to {{the west}} of the site <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> the {{tributary}} valley of Hope Wood before joining the main gorge. The original watercourse which may have cut the gorge into the limestone became diverted underground and now emerges at Wookey Hole Caves to form the River Axe.|$|E
5|$|A {{young woman}} {{steps out of}} an elevator, bloody and half-naked. She leaves the {{building}} and <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> a busy street. She is taken to a police station, where two detectives, Dan Williams (Casey Siemaszko) and Rosario Ortiz (Maya Days), find in her pocket a business card for Hollis M. Nye.|$|E

5|$|Marbled newts {{owe their}} name to their green–black, marbled colour pattern. In females, an orange-red line <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> back and tail. The crest of male marbled newts is smaller and fleshier {{than that of}} the crested newts and not indented, but marbled newt males also have a whitish tail band at {{breeding}} time.|$|E
5|$|Scar makes a brief cameo {{appearance}} in the film in Simba's nightmare. In the nightmare, an adult Simba <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> the cliff where his father died, attempting to rescue him. Scar intervenes, however, and then turns into Kovu and throws Simba off the cliff. Scar makes another cameo {{appearance in}} a pool of water, as a reflection, after Kovu is exiled from Pride Rock.|$|E
5|$|Children of Men used several lengthy single-shot {{sequences}} {{in which}} extremely complex actions take place. The longest {{of these are}} a shot in which Kee gives birth (199 seconds; 3:19); an ambush on a country road (247 seconds; 4:07); and {{a scene in which}} Theo is captured by the Fishes, escapes, and <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> a street and through a building {{in the middle of a}} raging battle (378 seconds; 6:18). These sequences were extremely difficult to film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion, aided by CGI effects.|$|E

5|$|Kaldalis is a protoss zealot and a {{close friend}} of Hierarch Artanis. Kaldalis takes pride {{in the history of the}} protoss and the Khala, though does not express {{prejudice}} towards the Nerazim, and believes that driving them away was a sin. A scar <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> his left eye. Kaldalis survived the zerg conquest of Aiur during the Great War. Afterwards, he joined the Protoss Protectorate led by Hierarch Artanis. Kaldalis was impressed by Artanis' vision of a unified protoss society, the Daelaam: incorporating the cultures of Khalai, Nerazim, Tal'Darim and Purifiers.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> {{to the foot of}} the cliffs. In the 13th century, the sea came up close to the stairway, allowing resupply by sea, but today the sea has retreated significantly, making it more difficult to envisage the concept in its original setting.|$|E
5|$|The road makes several {{appearances}} in literature. In Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, the titular character <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> the road {{trying to escape}} from London to Dover, though in the narrative the street is still partly rural in nature. After suffering an attack of amnesia, the main character of George Orwell's A Clergyman's Daughter, Dorothy Hare, finds herself alone on Old Kent Road. In 1985, the BBC arts series Arena included a documentary about the road.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} the {{population}} of the nearby village of Burnside was expanding and required a new water supply. First Creekwhich <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> Waterfall Gully and enters the River Torrens near today's Botanic Gardenswas seen as the perfect solution to the water shortage. A weir was built during 1881 and 1882, and was made to hold approximately two megalitres (530,000USgallons) of water. A pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at Burnside South, and from there the water was used throughout the surrounding area. As a side effect, the weir also reduced the volume of water available to the local market gardeners, and over many years that aspect of the region disappeared.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, Marvel {{announced}} that an eight-issue comic-book {{prelude to the}} film, written by Christopher Yost and Eric Pearson with art by Luke Ross and Daniel HDR, would be released in March 2012. In February 2012, Marvel announced {{the release of a}} second limited series comic book tie-in, Black Widow Strikes written by Fred Van Lente, who wrote Captain America: First Vengeance, the comic-book prequel to Captain America: The First Avenger. The story is set between Iron Man 2 and The Avengers and follows Black Widow as she <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> some loose ends from Iron Man 2. Additionally, the title Avengers Assemble was launched in March 2012, written by Brian Michael Bendis with art by Mark Bagley and features the same Avengers line-up as the film battling a new incarnation of the supervillain team Zodiac.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a {{man with}} a camera follows a woman from an {{elevator}} through a corridor to another elevator, where all the people appear to be gray. He gets off on a floor before the woman and <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> the stairs. Lights flicker and the elevator cable snaps. As the man reaches the basement, the cab crashes and its door spills open to reveal the woman's wrist, covered with blood. The man begins to snap photos. Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) assigns Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), along with Agent Peyton Ritter from New York, to the case. Scully's partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks at the material on Scully's desk and points out that the case looks like an X-file—and that Kersh is obviously splitting them up.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Nurse Edwards (Vernee Watson-Johnson) confronts Preijers {{about an}} {{injection}} {{she saw him}} give Reyes; he kills Edwards to cover his tracks. Later, in the floating hospital, Stephen collapses and disappears when he too is pulled off of life support. After Doggett is spotted with Audrey in the basement by Preijers, he begins to worry that she could expose what he is doing. He injects the same drug he used to kill Edwards, but Audrey is able to concentrate and move into the floating hospital one last time. She informs Reyes that her only way out is {{to jump into the}} void. Reyes does so and wakes up in her hospital bed moments before her organs are to be harvested. Doggett <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> to Audrey's room only to find that Preijers has killed her. Doggett manages to capture Preijers before he can escape.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{entering}} Cayuga County, NY31 crosses {{and begins to}} parallel the New York State Thruway (I-90), which NY31 does {{for most of its}} routing west of the outer Syracuse suburbs. In Port Byron, NY31 intersects NY38 {{in the center of the}} village. The routes embark on an overlap through the village before separating near the eastern edge of Port Byron. NY31 continues alone to Weedsport, where the route meets NY34 and County Route31B (CR31B, formerly NY31B) north of the village. East of Weedsport, NY31 and the Thruway are joined by the CSX Rochester Subdivision mainline, which <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> the center of the strip of land created by the Thruway to the north and NY31 to the south.|$|E
5|$|The Q11 {{begins at}} Queens Boulevard, and <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> {{the entire length}} of Woodhaven Boulevard and a short portion of Cross Bay Boulevard to Pitkin Avenue. The route then turns east along Pitkin, then south along several local streets through the eastern portion of Howard Beach, running near Aqueduct Racetrack and the Howard Beach–JFK Airport station of the subway and AirTrain JFK. At 160th Avenue, the route splits into two branches; a western branch to Old Howard Beach and an eastern branch to Hamilton Beach (the two neighborhoods are {{separated}} by Hawtree Creek). Both terminate near the southern coast of their respective neighborhoods at 165th Avenue. Select weekday rush hour trips short-turn at Pitkin Avenue. During late night hours, all Q11 trips terminate at Pitkin Avenue; prior to 2010, 24-hour service had been provided to Old Howard Beach and Hamilton Beach.|$|E

5|$|This {{causes a}} power flicker in the Hub; Ianto makes {{an excuse to}} look into it himself and finds Tanizaki's body. As he leaves Lisa to hide the body, she drains even more power by {{re-entering}} the conversion unit. Believing the Hub is under attack, team leader Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) sends Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) and Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) to the basement where they find the abandoned conversion unit. Jack <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> to find Owen unconscious and Gwen about to be converted. He stops the process and attempts to shoot Lisa, but Ianto stops him, allowing Lisa to escape. Ianto pleads with Jack that they try to save her, but Jack affirms that there is no cure.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E
