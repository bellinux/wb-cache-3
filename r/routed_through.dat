5|$|In 1985, the Utah Department of Transportation petitioned {{to extend}} US666 {{northwest}} to Richfield, but {{the proposal was}} rejected. The proposed extension followed SR95, SR24, and SR119. A concurrency with US191 would have been <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> Blanding and Monticello to connect {{to the rest of}} the route. One of the reasons cited for rejecting the proposal was that portions of SR24 were not built to standards desired for additions to the U.S. Highway System.|$|E
5|$|Until 1864, {{communications}} between Fort Greble {{and its neighbors}} had to be <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> departmental headquarters in Washington. After {{a test of the}} system completely failed, efforts were made to establish signaling points between the forts, and the forts themselves were connected to Washington via telegraph wire. Signal detachments were present at Fort Stanton, near Uniontown, and sometimes visited Fort Greble as part of training efforts.|$|E
5|$|When M-35 was <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> {{downtown}} Negaunee, it joined Bus. M-28 northward {{from the}} east fork of Silver Street on to US41/M-28. This routing was moved to bypass the city in 1964 when iron ore mining activity destabilized {{a portion of the}} M-35 routing southeast of town. From this point on, Bus. M-28 has not shared its routing with any other state trunklines.|$|E

5|$|A {{state highway}} was <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> {{downtown}} starting on May 13, 1913, {{when the system}} was created. It was first a part of M-15 when the highway system was signed in 1919, and then later as US41/M-28 after {{the creation of the}} United States Numbered Highway System in 1926. (Under the original 1925 draft plan for the U.S. Highway System, US102 was the number assigned to run through Marquette.) The streets have been paved since at least the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The US-412 {{designation}} {{was applied}} to preexisting Oklahoma highways. From Woodward to just east of Enid, US-412 replaced SH-15. From there to the I-35 junction, it was overlaid on US-64; east of I-35, the designation {{was applied to}} the Cimarron Turnpike. US-412 continued east {{from the end of the}} turnpike along US-64. From there, it was <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> the Tulsa metropolitan freeway system along I-244 and I-44. East of Tulsa, the highway replaced SH-33 to the Arkansas line. The highway designations made redundant by US-412 were removed, effective December 12, 1988.|$|E
5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E

5|$|After a busy week {{servicing}} Hubble, {{the crew}} of Atlantis had {{the majority of the}} day off, giving them time to rest and prepare for landing. They took their traditional on-orbit crew portrait, and spoke with reporters from around the world in a news conference. The crew also had the opportunity to speak with the Expedition 19 crew on board the International Space Station, in a conference call <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> satellites. The station crew congratulated them on a very successful mission, and {{the crew of}} Atlantis expressed their gratitude to the station crew for all the work they do during their long duration stays on the station.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Columbia become {{home to the}} {{headquarters}} of both the University of Missouri System and the Columbia College system. The insurance industry also became important to the local economy as several companies established headquarters in Columbia, including Shelter Insurance, Missouri Employers Mutual, and Columbia Insurance Group. State Farm Insurance has a regional office in Columbia. In addition, the now defunct Silvey Insurance was once a large local employer. Columbia became a transportation crossroads when U.S. Route 63 and U.S. Route 40 (which became present-day Interstate 70) were <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> the city. Soon after, the city opened the Columbia Regional Airport. By 2000, the city's population was nearly 85,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{the trail}} was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and a {{checkpoint}} was added there, and the Lake Laberge stretch {{was replaced by}} a route through Braeburn and along the Dawson-Whitehorse Overland Trail. In 1997, mushers were <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project and to the Alaska town of North Pole before continuing on to Fairbanks. The North Pole loop was removed before the 2009 race, and mushers were directed through Two Rivers instead. Starting in the 2010 race, the Mile 101 location was upgraded from a dog drop to a full-fledged checkpoint. In the past several races, the Two Rivers checkpoint has changed locations annually: from a lodge to a campground, and then to a gravel pit in 2011.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, {{the route}} was realigned onto {{the south and}} west {{beltline}} to bypass Grand Rapids; the old <b>routing</b> <b>through</b> downtown became Business M-50 (Bus. M-50). In the late 1950s, when the US127 freeway bypass east of Jackson opened up, the old <b>routing</b> <b>through</b> town became Bus. US127/M-50. At the same time, the concurrency with US23 between Dundee and the Ida area was dropped after the new US23 freeway opened; the old route becomes solely designated M-50.|$|R
5|$|Natural {{springs in}} the Senchal Range provide most of Darjeeling's water supply. Water {{collected}} is <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> stone conduits to two lakes that were constructed in 1910 and 1932, {{from where it}} is piped to the town after purification at the Jorebungalow filtration plant. During the dry season, when water supplied by springs is insufficient, water is pumped from Khong Khola, a nearby small perennial stream. Increasing demand {{has led to a}} worsening shortfall in water supply; just over 50% of the town's households are connected to the municipal water supply system. Various efforts made to augment the water supply, including the construction of a third storage reservoir in 1984, have failed to yield desired results.|$|E
5|$|One Canadian auto {{trail was}} <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> the UP as well. In 1920, the King's International Highway linked Vancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, {{but there was}} no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior. Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to {{continue}} along the auto trail. The routings varied on the maps of the time, but its basic route used US2 through the UP from Ironwood to Sault Ste. Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960; by that time, the auto trail had taken on the Trans-Canada Highway name.|$|E
5|$|Route 41 {{was chosen}} {{as one of the}} initial routes to be <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> the Metro Bus Tunnel in Downtown Seattle, but due to a delay in the {{production}} of special dual-mode buses for the tunnel, route 41 was not moved into the tunnel until 1991. Route 41 ran primarily during peak hours, with some limited midday service, and was supplemented by route 307, which ran from Downtown Seattle to Northgate and Bothell on weekends and nights. The northern terminus of route 41 was moved from Magnuson Park to 5th Avenue NE and NE 125th Street in 1997, eliminating service to Sand Point and Lake City.|$|E

5|$|StarCraft II {{does not}} offer the ability to play {{directly}} over a local area network (LAN), as is possible with StarCraft; all network games are <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> the Internet via Blizzard's gaming servers. The latency delay between commands issued and game response when played online is greatly reduced when playing over a LAN and this allows for much finer control over in-game units; there were concerns that a professional scene would not develop as a result. Over 250,000 fans signed a petition asking Blizzard to add LAN play to StarCraft II, before the game's release. Currently, Blizzard {{has no plans to}} support LAN play. Although it does not change the routing of the game through Blizzard's servers, a Players Near You feature was added in StarCraft II patch 2.0.4, to help with organizing games with other players on the same local network.|$|E
5|$|The MSHD started {{construction}} in 1936 {{on a new}} road that rerouted US2 into St. Ignace for the first time. Between Brevort and Moran, US2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the Tahquamenon Trail to meet the northern extension of US31 into the Upper Peninsula. The new routing took US2 along the lakeshore into St. Ignace. US31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and US2 was <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> St. Ignace along the former US31 to Rogers Park; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M‑122. Further changes in the early 1940s straightened the roadway out near Watersmeet and Crystal Falls.|$|E
5|$|The current M-82 {{dates back}} to 1926. It ran from US31 in Hart to the {{northern}} junction of US131 and M-46 in Howard City. The highway was <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> Ferry, Hesperia and Fremont, replacing M-41. In late 1936, M-46 was extended along the section between Newaygo and Howard City, forming a M-46/M-82 concurrency {{to fill a gap}} in the M-46 routing. This concurrent section became just M-46 in 1938, shortening M-82 back to the northern M-37 junction in Newaygo. The highway was moved to a new alignment west of Ferry in late 1947 or early 1948. Instead of heading northwesterly to Hart, it was continued west to end in Shelby.|$|E

5|$|Valley was a {{populated}} {{place and}} post {{office on the}} South Branch line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It was centered near the intersection of West Sioux Lane and Depot Valley Road, now located within the present-day corporate boundaries of Romney. Valley developed in 1884 following {{the completion of the}} South Branch line when the rail line's original southern terminus and corresponding Romney Depot were built there. The United States Post Office Department established a post office at Valley on May 19, 1928, remaining in operation until its disestablishment on June 15, 1937. Following the closure of Valley's post office, its mail was <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> the post office in Romney.|$|E
5|$|Yvonne Navarro co-wrote a novelization {{based on}} the {{original}} screenplay with Dennis Feldman. The book gives several in-depth details about the characters not seen in the film, such as Sil's ability to visualize odors and determine harmful substances from edible items by the color. Gas appears black, food appears pink, and an unhealthy potential mate appears to give off green fumes. Other character details include Preston's background in tracking down AWOL soldiers {{as well as the}} process of decoding the alien signal. Although no clues are given as to its origin, it is mentioned that the message was somehow <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> several black holes to mask its point of origin.|$|E
5|$|The Rush+ {{realignment}} {{was intended}} to free up space in the Rosslyn Portal (the tunnel between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom), which operates at full capacity already. When Silver Line service began, those trains would be <b>routed</b> <b>through</b> the tunnel, and so some of what were Blue Line trains to Largo Town Center were now diverted across the Fenwick Bridge to become Yellow Line trains running {{all the way up}} the Green Line to Greenbelt. Select Yellow Line trains running south diverted along the Blue Line to Franconia-Springfield (as opposed to the normal Yellow line terminus at Huntington). Until the start of Silver Line service, excess Rosslyn Tunnel capacity was used by additional Orange Line trains that traveled along the Blue Line to Largo (as opposed to the normal Orange Line terminus at New Carrollton). Rush+ had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys, though severely increasing headways for the portion of the Blue Line running between Pentagon and Rosslyn. In May 2017, Metro announced that Yellow Rush+ service would be eliminated effective June 25, 2017.|$|E
