40|$|AbstractDisposal of spent {{nuclear fuel}} is a major {{political}} and public-perception problem for nuclear energy. From a radiological standpoint, the long-lived component of {{spent nuclear fuel}} primarily consists of transuranic (TRU) isotopes. Full recycling of TRU isotopes can, in theory, lead {{to a reduction in}} repository radiotoxicity to reference levels corresponds to the radiotoxicity of the unburned natural U required to fuel a conventional LWR in as little as ∼ 500 years provided reprocessing and fuel fabrication losses are limited. This strategy forms part of many envisaged ‘sustainable’ nuclear fuel cycles. However, over a limited timeframe, the radiotoxicity of the ‘final’ core can dominate over <b>reprocessing</b> <b>losses,</b> leading to a much lower reduction in radiotoxicity compared to that achievable at equilibrium. The importance of low <b>reprocessing</b> <b>losses</b> and minor actinide (MA) recycling is also dependent on the timeframe during which actinides are recycled. In this paper, the fuel cycle code ORION is used to model the recycle of light water reactor (LWR) -produced TRUs in LWRs and sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) over 1 – 5 generations of reactors, which is sufficient to infer general conclusions for higher numbers of generations. Here, a generation is defined as a fleet of reactors operating for 60 years, before being retired and potentially replaced. Over up to ∼ 5 generations of full actinide recycle in SFR burners, the final core inventory tends to dominate over <b>reprocessing</b> <b>losses,</b> beyond which the radiotoxicity rapidly becomes sensitive to <b>reprocessing</b> <b>losses.</b> For a single generation of SFRs, {{there is little or no}} advantage to recycling MAs. However, for multiple generations, the reduction in repository radiotoxicity is severely limited without MA recycling, and repository radiotoxicity converges on equilibrium after around 3 generations of SFRs. With full actinide recycling, at least 6 generations of SFRs are required in a gradual phase-out of nuclear power to achieve transmutation performance approaching the theoretical equilibrium performance – which appears challenging from an economic and energy security standpoint. TRU recycle in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) with zero net actinide production provides similar performance to low-enriched-uranium (LEU) -fueled LWRs in equilibrium with a fleet of burner SFRs. However, it is not possible to reduce the TRU inventory over multiple generations of PWRs. TRU recycle in break-even SFRs is much less effective from a point of view of reducing spent nuclear fuel radiotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|The COmbined Non-Fertile and UO 2 (CONFU) {{fuel system}} for {{sustainable}} actinide management {{has the potential}} to reduce accumulation of actinides in the next 50 years under the assumption of a growing worldwide nuclear energy power demand. The system, which is compatible with currently operating Light Water Reactors (LWRs), employs CONFU fuel assemblies where about 20 % of the UO 2 fuel pins are replaced with fertile free fuel (FFF) hosting the TRU. Over the next 50 years the CONFU is shown to allow reduction of the TRU stored inventory by 25 % with respect to the reference once-through (OT) fuel cycle scheme. The CONFU assembly has a net TRU incineration rate equal to zero, which depletes the TRU inventory by displacing this mass from the spent fuel inventory into the CONFU cores to meet the growing power demand (only <b>reprocessing</b> <b>losses</b> of TRU proceed to repository). Additionally, further TRU reduction using a CONFU assembly that achieves a net TRU destruction with each cycle appears possible. 56...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFull {{recycling}} of transuranic (TRU) isotopes can in theory {{lead to a}} reduction in repository radiotoxicity to reference levels in as little as ∼ 500 years provided reprocessing and fuel fabrication losses are limited. However, over a limited timeframe, the radiotoxicity of the ‘final’ core can dominate over <b>reprocessing</b> <b>losses,</b> leading to a much lower reduction in radiotoxicity compared to that achievable at equilibrium. In Part I of this paper, TRU recycle over up to 5 generations of light water reactors (LWRs) or sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) is considered for uranium (U) fuel cycles. With full actinide recycling, at least 6 generations of SFRs are required in a gradual phase-out of nuclear power to achieve transmutation performance approaching the theoretical equilibrium performance. U-fuelled SFRs operating a break-even fuel cycle are not particularly effective at reducing repository radiotoxicity as the final core load dominates over a very long timeframe. In this paper, the analysis is extended to the thorium (Th) fuel cycle. Closed Th-based fuel cycles are well known to have lower equilibrium radiotoxicity than U-based fuel cycles but the time taken to reach equilibrium is generally very long. Th burner fuel cycles with SFRs are found to result in very similar radiotoxicity to U burner fuel cycles with SFRs for one less generation of reactors, provided that protactinium (Pa) is recycled. Th-fuelled reduced-moderation boiling water reactors (RBWRs) are also considered, but for burner fuel cycles their performance is substantially worse, with the waste taking ∼ 3 – 5 times longer to decay to the reference level than for Th-fuelled SFRs with the same number of generations. Th break-even fuel cycles require ∼ 3 generations of operation before their waste radiotoxicity benefits result in decay to the reference level in ∼ 1000 years. While this is a very long timeframe, it is roughly half that required for waste from the Th or U burner fuel cycle to decay to the reference level, and less than a tenth that required for the U break-even fuel cycle. The improved performance over burner fuel cycles is due to a more substantial contribution of energy generated by 233 U leading to lower radiotoxicity per unit energy generation. To some extent this an argument based on how the radiotoxicity is normalised: operating a break-even fuel cycle rather than phasing out nuclear power using a burner fuel cycle results in higher repository radiotoxicity in absolute terms. The advantage of Th break-even fuel cycles is also contingent on recycling Pa, and <b>reprocessing</b> <b>losses</b> are significant also for a small number of generations due to the need to effectively burn down the TRU. The integrated decay heat over the scenario timeframe is almost twice as high for a break-even Th fuel cycle than a break-even U fuel cycle when using SFRs, as a result of much higher 90 Sr production, which subsequently decays into 90 Y. The peak decay heat is comparable. As decay heat at vitrification and repository decay heat affect repository sizing, this may weaken the argument for the Th cycle...|$|R
40|$|The fuel {{composition}} of the Generation IV 600 MWth 'efficient' Gas Cooled Fast Reactor (GCFR) that realizes zero breeding gain without using fertile blankets is determined. The analysis includes all the stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, including irradiation, reprocessing and fuel fabrication. The time-dependent multiplication factor, reactor safety parameters, and decay heat production for different {{fuel composition}}s are simulated using the deterministic SCALE 4. 4 code. The depletion equation and the 1 -D transport equation are solved for multiple timesteps during reactor irradiation. It is seen that adding {{a small percentage of}} minor actinides (MA) to a mixture of uranium- and plutonium carbide favors the creation of a closed fuel cycle with zero breeding gain. Furthermore, addition of MA increases the burnup potential of the fuel, extending its feasible irradiation time from 40 to 90 MWd / kg, due to the transmutation of Np- 237 to fissionable Pu- 238 and Am- 241 to fissionable Am- 242. Mixing MA negatively affects safety parameters by decreasing the delayed neutron fraction, decreasing the negative Doppler feedback and increasing the positive reactivity introduced when the reactor is depressurized. However, the magnitude of the delayed neutron fraction is comparable to existing fast reactors. Worths of individual isotopes are introduced as a value of their contribution to the core reactivity. Throughout the fuel cycle, the time-dependence of the isotopic and total worth of the fuel is determined. Zero breeding gain is achieved when the initial total worth of the fuel stays constant for multiple cycle burnup. The effect of different reprocessing strategies on the closed fuel cycle is shown. Research confirms that when there are no <b>reprocessing</b> <b>losses,</b> depleted uranium can be used during the recycling step to replace fission products and obtain a new critical fuel composition.

2500|$|Less {{long-lived}} waste. LFTRs can dramatically {{reduce the}} long-term radiotoxicity of their reactor wastes. Light water reactors with uranium fuel have fuel {{that is more}} than 95% U-238. These reactors normally transmute part of the U-238 to Pu-239, a long-lived isotope. Almost all of the fuel is therefore only one step away from becoming a transuranic long-lived element. Plutonium-239 has a half life of 24,000 years, and is the most common transuranic in spent nuclear fuel from light water reactors. Transuranics like Pu-239 cause the perception that reactor wastes are an eternal problem. In contrast, the LFTR uses the thorium fuel cycle, which transmutes thorium to U-233. Because thorium is a lighter element, more neutron captures are required to produce the transuranic elements. U-233 has two chances to fission in a LFTR. First as U-233 (90% will fission) and then the remaining 10% has another chance as it transmutes to U-235 (80% will fission). The fraction of fuel reaching neptunium-237, the most likely transuranic element, is therefore only 2%, about 15kg perGWe-year. This is a transuranic production 20x smaller than light water reactors, which produce 300kg of transuranics per GWe-year. Importantly, because of this much smaller transuranic production, {{it is much easier to}} recycle the transuranics. That is, they are sent back to the core to eventually fission. Reactors operating on the U238-plutonium fuel cycle produce far more transuranics, making full recycle difficult on both reactor neutronics and the recycling system. In the LFTR, only a fraction of a percent, as <b>reprocessing</b> <b>losses,</b> goes to the final waste. When these two benefits of lower transuranic production, and recycling, are combined, a thorium fuel cycle reduces the production of transuranic wastes by more than a thousand-fold compared to a conventional once-through uranium-fueled light water reactor. The only significant long-lived waste is the uranium fuel itself, but this can be used indefinitely by recycling, always generating electricity.If the thorium stage ever has to be shut down, part of the reactors can be shut down and their uranium fuel inventory burned out in the remaining reactors, allowing a burndown of even this final waste to as small a level as society demands. The LFTR does still produce radioactive fission products in its waste, but they don't last very long - the radiotoxicity of these fission products is dominated by cesium-137 and strontium-90. The longer half-life is cesium: 30.17 years. So, after 30.17 years, decay reduces the radioactivity by a half. Ten half-lives will reduce the radioactivity by two raised to a power of ten, a factor of 1,024. Fission products at that point, in about 300 years, are less radioactive than natural uranium. What's more, the liquid state of the fuel material allows separation of the fission products not only from the fuel, but from each other as well, which enables them to be sorted by the length of each fission product's half-life, so that the ones with shorter half-lives can be brought out of storage sooner than those with longer half-lives.|$|R
40|$|Process mean {{selection}} for a container-filling process {{is an important}} decision in a single-vendor single-buyer supply chain. Since the process mean determines the vendor's conforming and yield rates, it influences the vendor-buyer decisions regarding the production lot size and number of shipments delivered from the vendor to buyer. It follows, therefore, that these decisions should be determined simultaneously {{in order to control}} the supply chain total cost. In this paper, we develop a model that integrates the single-vendor single-buyer problem with the process mean selection problem. This integrated model allows the vendor to deliver the produced lot to buyer in number of unequal-sized shipments. Moreover, every outgoing item is inspected, and each item failing to meet a lower specification limit is reprocessed. Further, in order to study the benefits of using this integrated model, two baseline cases are developed. The first of which considers a hierarchical model where the vendor determines the process mean and schedules of production and shipment separately. This hierarchical model is used to show the impact of integrating the process mean selection with production/inventory decisions. The other baseline case is studied in the sensitivity analysis where the optimal solution for a given process is compared to the optimal solution when the variation in the process output is negligible. The integrated model is expected to lead to reduction in <b>reprocessing</b> cost, minimal <b>loss</b> to customer due to the deviation from the optimum target value, and consequently, providing better products at reduced cost for customers. Also, a solution procedure is devised to find the optimal solution for the proposed model and sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the effect of the model key parameters on the optimal solution.

40|$|The {{once through}} nuclear fuel cycle {{adopted by the}} {{majority}} of countries with operating commercial power reactors imposes a number of concerns. The radioactive waste created in the once through nuclear fuel cycle has to be isolated from the environment for thousands of years. In addition, plutonium and other actinides, after the decay of fission products, could become targets for weapon proliferators. Furthermore, {{only a small fraction of}} the energy potential in the fuel is being used. All these concerns can be addressed if a closed fuel cycle strategy is considered offering the possibility for partitioning and transmutation of long lived radioactive waste, enhanced proliferation resistance, and improved utilization of natural resources. It is generally believed that dedicated advanced reactor systems have to be designed in order to perform the task of nuclear waste transmutation effectively. The development and deployment of such innovative systems is technically and economically challenging. In this work, a possibility of constraining the generation of long lived radioactive waste through multi-recycling of Trans-uranic actinides (TRU) in existing Light Water Reactors (LWR has been studied. Thorium based and fertile free fuels (FFF) were analyzed as the most attractive candidates for TRU burning in LWRs. Although both fuel types can destroy TRU at comparable rates (about 1150 kg/GWe-Year in FFF and up to 900 kg/GWe-Year in Th) and achieve comparable fractional TRU burnup (close to 50 a/o), the Th fuel requires significantly higher neutron moderation than practically feasible in a typical LWR lattice to achieve such performance. On the other hand, the FFF exhibits nearly optimal TRU destruction performance in a typical LWR fuel lattice geometry. Increased TRU presence in LWR core leads to neutron spectrum hardening, which results in reduced control materials reactivity worth. The magnitude of this reduction is directly related to the amount of TRU in the core. A potential for positive void reactivity feedback limits the maximum TRU loading. Th and conventional mixed oxide (MOX) fuels require higher than FFF TRU loading to sustain a standard 18 fuel cycle length due to neutron captures in Th 232 and U 238 respectively. Therefore, TRU containing Th and U cores have lower control materials worth and greater potential for a positive void coefficient than FFF core. However, the significantly reduced fuel Doppler coefficient of the fully FFF loaded core and the lower delayed neutron fraction lead to questions about the FFF performance in reactivity initiated accidents. The Combined Non-Fertile and UO[subscript 2] (CONFU) assembly concept is proposed for multirecycling of TRU in existing PWRs. The assembly assumes a heterogeneous structure where about 20 % of the UO[subscript 2] fuel pins on the assembly periphery are replaced with FFF pins hosting TRU generated in the previous cycle. The possibility of achieving zero TRU net is demonstrated. The concept takes advantage of superior TRU destruction performance in FFF allowing minimization of TRU inventory. At the same time, the core physics is still dominated by UO[subscript 2] fuel allowing maintenance of core safety and control characteristics comparable to all-UO[subscript 2]. A comprehensive neutronic and thermal hydraulic analysis as well as numerical simulation of reactivity initiated accidents demonstrated the feasibility of TRU containing LWR core designs of various heterogeneous geometries. The power peaking and reactivity coefficients for the TRU containing heterogeneous cores are comparable to those of conventional UO[subscript 2] cores. Three to five TRU recycles are required to achieve an equilibrium fuel cycle length and TRU generation and destruction balance. A majority of TRU nuclides reach their equilibrium concentration levels in less than 20 recycles. The exceptions are Cm 246, Cm 248, and Cf 252. Accumulation of these isotopes is highly undesirable with regards to TRU fuel fabrication and handling because they are very strong sources of spontaneous fission (SF) neutrons. Allowing longer cooling times of the spent fuel before reprocessing can drastically reduce the SF neutron radiation problem due to decay of Cm 244 and Cf 252 isotopes with particularly high SF source. Up to 10 TRU recycles are likely to be feasible if 20 years cooling time between recycles is adopted. Multi-recycling of TRU in the CONFU assembly reduces the relative fraction of fissile isotopes in the TRU vector from about 60 % in the initial spent UO[subscript 2] to about 25 % at equilibrium. As a result, the fuel cycle length is reduced by about 30 %. An increase in the enrichment of UO[subscript 2] pins from 4. 2 to at least 5 % is required to compensate for the TRU isotopics degradation. The environmental impact of the sustainable CONFU assembly based fuel cycle is limited by the efficiency of TRU recovery in spent fuel <b>reprocessing.</b> TRU <b>losses</b> of 0. 1 % from the CONFU fuel reprocessing ensure the CONFU fuel cycle radiotoxicity reduction to the level of corresponding amount of original natural uranium ore within 1000 years. The cost of the sustainable CONFU based fuel cycle is about 60 % higher than that of the once through UO[subscript 2] fuel cycle, whereas the difference in total cost of electricity between the two cycles is only 8 %. The higher fuel cycle cost is a result of higher uranium enrichment in a CONFU assembly required to compensate for the degradation of TRU isotopics and cost of reprocessing. The major expense in the sustainable CONFU fuel cycle is associated with the reprocessing of UO[subscript 2] fuel. Although reprocessing and fabrication of FFF pins have relatively high unit costs, their contribution to the fuel cycle cost is marginal as a result of the small TRU throughput. Reductions in the unit costs of UO[subscript 2] reprocessing and FFF fabrication by a factor of two would result in comparable fuel cycle costs for the CONFU and conventional once through cycle. An increase in natural uranium prices and waste disposal fees will also make the closed fuel cycle more economically attractive. Although, the cost of the CONFU sustainable fuel cycle is comparable to that of a closed cycle using a critical fast actinide burning reactor (ABR), the main advantage of the CONFU is the possibility of fast deployment, since it does not require as extensive development and demonstration as needed for fast reactors. The cost of the CONFU fuel cycle is projected to be considerably lower than that of a cycle with an accelerator driven fast burner system. Idaho National LaboratoryUnited States.
