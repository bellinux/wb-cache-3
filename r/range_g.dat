40|$|To better {{understand}} {{the environmental impact of}} lead (Pb) in shooting range soils, Pb levels in three berm soils were characterized via size distribution, total Pb concentration, water-soluble Pb, sequential extraction and X-ray diffraction (XRD). About 60 % of the mid-berm soils of <b>ranges</b> <b>G</b> and O existed in grain sizes between 0. 5 and 0. 25 mm (medium sand) while range-L was most abundant in the 0. 25 – 0. 106 mm (fine sand) size fraction. All three range soils had the most accumulation of lead (60 – 70 %) in the very coarse sand size (2. 0 – 1. 0 mm). In <b>ranges</b> <b>G</b> and L, the index shows a decreasing Pb enrichment with decreasing particle size, which may be a result of bullet fragmentation and abrasion in shooting range soils. Sequential extractions reveal that <b>ranges</b> <b>G</b> and L had the highest proportion of Pb bound to organic matter while range-O was dominated by the carbonate-bound fraction. However, a substantial proportion (one-third) of Pb in soil from the three shooting ranges was associated with carbonates. The XRD result revealed the dominance of carbonates in range-O soil, calcite in range-G soil and metallic lead in <b>ranges</b> <b>G</b> and O soil. The conversion of metallic lead to carbonates may be a mechanism for natural attenuation of lead in shooting range soils. Implications for remediation of shooting range soils are further discussed...|$|R

G. korfii has a more block-like or square appearance, and its yellowish-brown to reddish-brown cap surface has fewer wrinkles, folds, and convolutions. G. fastigiata is a European species that resembles the North American G. brunnea. The common and widespread G. esculenta has a loosely lobed, irregularly shaped, brainlike cap. It has shorter spores measuring 21-25 by 12-13 μm.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a linear theory for the {{barotropic}} large-scale current fluctuations at midlatitudes driven by fluctuating winds is presented. It {{is based on}} both numerical and analytical arguments and provides an extention of the steady Munk’s theory of the wind-driven circulation {{to the case of}} a time-dependent wind forcing. The numerical resolution of a circulation model forced by an idealized oscillatory wind in a box leads to two distinct ranges for the oceanic fluctuating response. The first one is Rossby wavelike and westward intensified, with a width of the western boundary layer decreasing with increasing eddy viscosity AH. For sufficiently high values of the latter, a second range arises in which the wavelike character disappears and the boundary layer width increases with AH. To explain this behavior an analytical expression is proposed for the first (linear inertial– viscous) range in terms of an appropriate superposition of damped forced Rossby waves. Such expression provides also a length scale for the oscillating western boundary layer, which is inversely proportional to viscosity and proportional to the fourth power of the forcing frequency v. The second (purely viscous) range corresponds to oscillating Munk’s western boundary layer and Sverdrup flow in the oceanic interior. A nondimensional number, G 5 AHb 2 /v 3, is determined (b is the variation of the Coriolis parameter with latitude), which controls the transition between the two ranges.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the tactile pressure thresholds perceived with dental implants during a three-month healing phase following implant placement (osseointegration phase). The absolute threshold of tactile perception was measured in a group of patients 1 week, 1, 2 and 3 months following implant placement (ITI Dental Implant System, Straumann AG, Waldenburg, Switzerland). Contralateral and neighbouring teeth were measured at the same time. For determination of the axial forces exerted on the implants and teeth, an electronic device with semiconductor strain gauges was used (Hämmerle et al. 1995). The results demonstrated mean thresholds of tactile perception for the implants of 160. 2 g (SD 61. 7 <b>g,</b> <b>range</b> 77 ̃ 283 g) at 1 week, 133. 4 g (SD 51. 9 <b>g,</b> <b>range</b> 32 ̃ 239 g) at 1 month, 147. 9 g (SD 53. 5 <b>g,</b> <b>range</b> 70 ̃ 257 g) at 2 months, and 146. 9 g (SD 57. 4 <b>g,</b> <b>range</b> 77 ̃ 248 g) at 3 months. Statistical analysis using Student's paired t-test revealed no significant differences between the values over time. The control teeth exhibited mean values for tactile perception of 13. 1 g (SD 9. 6 <b>g,</b> <b>range</b> 5 ̃ 47 g) at 1 week, 10. 2 g (SD 6. 4 <b>g,</b> <b>range</b> 4 ̃ 29 g) at I month, 14. 8 g (SD 15. 9 <b>g,</b> <b>range</b> 2 ̃ 58 g) at 2 months, and 15. 4 g (SD 12. 2 <b>g,</b> <b>range</b> 3 ̃ 36 g) at 3 months. Again, these values did not differ significantly from each other and indicated the absence of systemic alterations in perceived pressure threshold over the observation period. The mean perceived pressure threshold was more than 10 times higher for implants than for natural teeth (P 0. 001) at all observation times. It is concluded that the absolute threshold of tactile perception with dental implants during the phase of osseointegration is not affected by bone and soft tissue healing taking place during the time period.
