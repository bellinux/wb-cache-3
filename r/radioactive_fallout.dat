5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout,</b> including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout</b> from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E
5|$|The cockroach's {{ability to}} {{withstand}} radiation better than {{human beings can}} be explained through the cell cycle. Cells are most vulnerable {{to the effects of}} radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once each time it molts, which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach. Since not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time, many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation, but lingering <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout</b> would still be harmful.|$|E
5|$|Warren was {{personally}} responsible for the safety aspects of the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July 1945 at Alamogordo, New Mexico. There was considerable concern about <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout</b> and a network of geiger counters was established to track the fallout cloud. Groves found Warren at the base camp shortly after the explosion and was displeased to discover that Warren had been awake for the previous 48 hours. Groves had US Navy Captain George Lyons take over so Warren could get some rest. Fortunately, no problems arose with the test.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to get {{information}} on the possibilities of the shallow lake self-cleaning from plutonium isotopes using Lake Žuvintas {{as an object of}} study. A choice of the object is mainly related to the peculiarity of hydrology and hydrodynamics of Lake Žuvintas located {{in the southern part of}} Lithuania that was affected by <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallouts</b> after the nuclear events. During the period of study the bottom sediments of Lake Žuvintas behaved mainly as an accumulator of Pu isotopes. The main part of plutonium of the Chernobyl origin in surface sediments is present in exchangeable and potentially mobile physico-chemical forms. Processes of Pu migration are especially active during winter season when under anaerobic conditions the most important role in the Pu isotopes transfer belongs to reduced plutonium ions...|$|R
50|$|Matayoshi {{was born}} in Kwajalein. His father, Woodrow Matayoshi, was a second-generation Japanese American from Hawaii, whose parents were {{immigrants}} from Okinawa. Matayoshi's mother, Almira Ainri, was a Marshallese from Rongelap and was an activist on issues pertaining to nuclear warfare until her death in June 2005. In her youth, Ainri was exposed to <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallouts</b> from the nuclear bomb tests, which left her with thyroid problems {{for the rest of}} her life. Two of Matayoshi's older siblings, Robert and Alex also suffered from thyroid problems as a result of the nuclear bomb tests. Ainri also suffered a miscarriage in 1955 which resulted in a stillborn child without a skeleton. In his youth, Matayoshi was educated in Hawaii, but returned to the Marshall Islands and was elected as Rongelap's mayor in 1995.|$|R
5|$|As {{the only}} {{scientist}} {{among the five}} AEC commissioners, it fell to Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration's stance on atmospheric nuclear testing. He argued that the dangers of radiation from nuclear tests were less than that from chest X-rays, and therefore {{less important than the}} risk of having an inadequate nuclear arsenal, but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public. In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of research studies to ascertain the impact of <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout</b> on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC. By 1958, even Libby and Teller were supporting limits on atmospheric nuclear testing.|$|E
5|$|Safety and {{security}} required a remote, isolated and unpopulated area. The scientists also wanted a flat area to minimize secondary {{effects of the}} blast, and with little wind to spread <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout.</b> Eight candidate sites were considered: the Tularosa Valley; the Jornada del Muerto Valley; the area southwest of Cuba, New Mexico, and north of Thoreau; and the lava flats of the El Malpais National Monument, all in New Mexico; the San Luis Valley near the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in Colorado; the Desert Training Area and San Nicolas Island in Southern California; and the sand bars of Padre Island, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Between 1962 and 1992 {{there was}} a {{hardened}} nuclear bunker, built for No 16 Group Royal Observer Corps Shrewsbury, who provided the field force of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation and would have sounded the four-minute warning alarm {{in the event of}} war and warned the population of Shrewsbury in the event of approaching <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout.</b> The building was manned by up to 120 volunteers who trained on a weekly basis and wore a Royal Air Force style uniform. After the breakup of the communist bloc in 1989, the Royal Observer Corps was disbanded between September 1991 and December 1995. However, the nuclear bunker still stands just inside Holywell Street near the Abbey as a lasting reminder of the Cold War, but is now converted and used as a veterinary practice.|$|E
40|$|Thyroid {{cancer in}} {{children}} is usually rare, {{but in the}} individuals exposed to radiation risk of disease increases considerably. After the Chernobyl acci-dent in 1986, an over 10 -fold maximal elevation {{in the incidence of}} thyroid cancer was registered about a decade later, cumulatively resulting in more than a thousand of newly diagnosed cases in children who lived in the ter-ritories of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine affected by <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallouts.</b> Experience from the epidemic substantially promoted knowledge in clini-cal pediatric oncology, pathology and basic sciences. This article overviews epidemiology, clinical features, results of treatment and follow-up of childhood patients with radiation-induced Chernobyl thyroid cancer in comparison to sporadic cases diagnosed at present. In addition, we dis-cuss general issues of pathology and molecular findings in childhood thy-roid carcinomas. (Arq Bras Endocrinol Metab 2007; 51 / 5 : 748 - 762...|$|R

5|$|Graves and Elizabeth {{moved to}} work at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico {{when it opened in}} 1943. He made it a {{condition}} of his going to Los Alamos that a job be found there for her. This was probably unnecessary, as someone with her skills—she {{was one of the few}} physicists who had experience with a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator—would have been quickly snapped up at Los Alamos. At the time of the Trinity nuclear test in 1945, Elizabeth was seven months pregnant with her first child. Graves therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. They listened to Samuel K. Allison's countdown to the explosion on the radio, and monitored the <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout</b> from the test, which took until the afternoon to reach them, with Geiger counters. The child was a healthy daughter, Marilyn Edith.|$|E
5|$|The other iodine radioisotopes {{have much}} shorter half-lives, {{no longer than}} days. Some of them have medical {{applications}} involving the thyroid gland, where the iodine that enters the body is stored and concentrated. Iodine-123 has a half-life of thirteen hours and decays by electron capture to tellurium-123, emitting gamma radiation; it is used in nuclear medicine imaging, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and X-ray computed tomography (X-Ray CT) scans. Iodine-125 has a half-life of fifty-nine days, decaying by electron capture to tellurium-125 and emitting low-energy gamma radiation; the second-longest-lived iodine radioisotope, it has uses in biological assays, nuclear medicine imaging and in radiation therapy as brachytherapy to treat a number of conditions, including prostate cancer, uveal melanomas, and brain tumours. Finally, iodine-131, with a half-life of eight days, beta decays to an excited state of stable xenon-131 that then converts to the ground state by emitting gamma radiation. It is a common fission product and thus is present in high levels in <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout.</b> It may then be absorbed through contaminated food, and will also accumulate in the thyroid. As it decays, it may cause damage to the thyroid. The primary risk from exposure {{to high levels of}} iodine-131 is the chance occurrence of radiogenic thyroid cancer in later life. Other risks include the possibility of non-cancerous growths and thyroiditis. The usual means of protection against the negative effects of iodine-131 is by saturating the thyroid gland with stable iodine-127 in the form of potassium iodide tablets, taken daily for optimal prophylaxis. However, iodine-131 may also be used for medicinal purposes in radiation therapy for this very reason, when tissue destruction is desired after iodine uptake by the tissue. Iodine-131 is also used as a radioactive tracer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It {{is known}} that {{irradiation}} stress induces late intracellular processes and adaptation. In this paper, we formulate the adaptation hypothesis. On its basis, we present statistical modeling of cellular distributions {{on the number of}} chromo-somal abnormalities in root meristems of pea seeds that experienced low-dose-rate irradiation, high temperatures, and ag-ing. The modeling shows that multiple appearances of chromosomal abnormalities can be explained as a result of primary or late processes caused by DNA damage, with or without cell selection, which can be described with geometrical or Pois-son distributions, respectively. The connections between the late intercellular processes (the “bystander effects”) and late intracellular regulatory processes are considered. It is shown that combinations of low-dose-rate irradiation, high tempera-tures, and aging lead to synergistically increasing instabilities and decreasing seed survivals. Approaches to risk estima-tion of chromosomal instability are investigated in plant cells and in human blood lymphocytes. Risks of instability were estimated as values of distribution parameters dependent on radiation intensity in ecology and in generations of persons who experienced <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallouts</b> from nuclear tests. We conclude that statistical model of adaptation describes intra-and intercellular processes of genetic instability coupled with selection, and that the risks of these processes can be calcu-lated as model parameters...|$|R
30|$|Isotope {{hydrology}} {{was born}} {{just after the}} Second World War, mainly as a resultant of the knowledge collected in the monitoring of man-made <b>radioactive</b> nuclide <b>fallout</b> (specifically tritium) and the usage of radioactive isotopes as age estimation tools in geology with the theoretical understanding gained on the fractionation of isotopic species (Aggarwal, et al., 2005). Thus, a field called “Isotope hydrology—the use of isotopic tools {{in the study of}} water cycle” came into existence, and today isotope hydrology is considered as the most promising modern hydrological tools, apart from remote-sensing, for water resources managers and practitioners.|$|R
50|$|In 1949, Smith at Oak Ridge {{conducted}} a study sponsored by the A.E.C.’s Division of Biology and Medicine, and performed calculations to determine the theoretical number of atomic bomb detonations necessary to achieve significant radiation exposure and <b>radioactive</b> material <b>fallout.</b> In 1951 after the Ranger and Greenhouse tests, Smith reassessed the earlier calculations and estimates. He determined that detonation of 100,000 Nagasaki type bombs would be sufficient to achieve the doomsday effect. With this information, the A.E.C.’s staff of the Division of Biology and Medicine concluded this to be extremely remote and dubbed the study as Project GABRIEL.|$|R

25|$|On 24 March, three {{workers were}} exposed {{to high levels of}} {{radiation}} which caused two of them to require hospital treatment after radioactive water seeped through their protective clothes while working in unit 3. It rained in Tokyo from the morning of 21 March to 24 March. The rain brought <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout</b> there. In Shinjuku, based on the research by Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health, 83900 Bq/m2 of I-131, 6310 Bq/m2 of Cs-134, and 6350 Bq/m2 of Cs-137 were detected for these four days in total as <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout,</b> including 24hours from 20 March 9:00am to 21 March 9:00am.|$|E

25|$|The global alarm over <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout,</b> {{which began}} with the Castle Bravo event, {{eventually}} drove nuclear testing literally underground. The last U.S. above-ground test took place at Johnston Island on November 4, 1962.

40|$|Detecting {{changes in}} humans {{that result from}} {{radioactive}} contamination of the area of residence many years after an incident (i. e., when the radiation has substantially decayed) presents a difficult epidemiological problem. Problems of this kind are even more complicated ina areas where the population is continually exposed to other harmful man-made factors. The city of Kamensk-Uralsky (Sverdlovsk region, Russia) is a good case in point. In 1957, part of Kamensk-Uralsky was contaminated {{as the result of}} an accident at the Kyshtym nuclear plant. In addition, the population of the contaminated area is being exposed to atmospheric emissions from several industrial enterprises. Two comparable groups of residents were formed: one in the contaminated are and another in a control area within the same city characterized by similar levels of chemical pollution but substantially lower radioactive contamination. The groups were composed of only those people who had been living in these areas continually since time of the accident and who were under 15 years of age {{at the time of the}} accident. The groups were matched by sex, age, and socio-occupational characteristics. For each subject, data were gathered on more than 50 parameters including hematological, immunological, and biochemical indices of the health status. All these data were obtained from blood tests taken in the fall of 1992. Data processing was carried out with the help of a computerized mathematical pattern recognition methodology, which ensured reliable discrimination between the generalized health status in the areas under study. We found that the health status of inhabitants of the area more contaminated with <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallouts</b> was adversely affected by radiation...|$|R
50|$|The nuclear bunker buster is {{the nuclear}} weapon {{version of the}} bunker buster. The non-nuclear {{component}} of the weapon is designed to greatly enhance the penetration into soil, rock, or concrete to deliver a nuclear warhead to a target. These weapons {{would be used to}} destroy hardened, underground military bunkers deeply buried. In theory, the amount of <b>radioactive</b> nuclear <b>fallout</b> would be reduced from that of a standard, air-burst nuclear detonation because they would have relatively low explosive yield. However, because such weapons necessarily come into contact with large amounts of earth-based debris, they may, under certain circumstances, still generate significant fallout. Warhead yield and weapon design have changed periodically throughout the history of the design of such weapons. An underground explosion releases a larger fraction of its energy into the ground, compared to an explosion at or above the surface which releases most of its energy into the atmosphere.|$|R

25|$|According to General Aleksandr Rukshin, the Russian Deputy Chief of Staff, the new {{bomb was}} smaller than the MOAB but much deadlier because the {{temperature}} at {{the centre of the}} blast is twice as high.

25|$|Storax Sedan was {{a shallow}} {{underground}} nuclear test conducted in Area 10 of Yucca Flat at the Nevada National Security Site on July 6, 1962 {{as part of}} Operation Plowshare, a program to investigate {{the use of nuclear}} weapons for mining, cratering, and other civilian purposes. The <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout</b> from the test contaminated more US residents than any other nuclear test. The Sedan Crater is the largest man-made crater in the United States, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|Most fission {{products}} {{have too many}} neutrons to be stable so they are radioactive by beta decay, converting neutrons into protons by throwing off beta particles (electrons) and gamma rays. Their half lives range from milliseconds to about 200,000 years. Many decay into isotopes that are themselves radioactive, so from 1 to 6 (average 3) decays {{may be required to}} reach stability. In reactors, the radioactive products are the nuclear waste in spent fuel. In bombs, they become <b>radioactive</b> <b>fallout,</b> both local and global.|$|E
50|$|Atomic {{and nuclear}} tests can involve many hazards. Some {{of these were}} {{illustrated}} in the U.S. Castle Bravo test in 1954. The weapon design tested was {{a new form of}} hydrogen bomb, and the scientists underestimated how vigorously some of the weapon materials would react. As a result, the explosion—with a yield of 15 Mt—was over twice what was predicted. Aside from this problem, the weapon also generated a large amount of <b>radioactive</b> nuclear <b>fallout,</b> more than had been anticipated, and a change in the weather pattern caused the fallout to spread in a direction not cleared in advance. The fallout plume spread high levels of radiation for over a hundred miles, contaminating a number of populated islands in nearby atoll formations. Though they were soon evacuated, many of the islands' inhabitants suffered from radiation burns and later from other effects such as increased cancer rate and birth defects, as did the crew of the Japanese fishing boat Daigo Fukuryū Maru. One crewman died from radiation sickness after returning to port, and it was feared that the radioactive fish they had been carrying had made it into the Japanese food supply.|$|R
