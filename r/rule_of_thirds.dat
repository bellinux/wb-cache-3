2500|$|Breathing gas management: The {{breathing}} {{gas supply}} must last the diver until {{out of the}} overhead environment. There are several strategies for gas management. The most common protocol is the 'rule of thirds,' in which {{one third of the}} initial gas supply is used for ingress, one third for egress, and one third to support another team member {{in the case of an}} emergency. This is a very simple method, but is not always sufficient. UK practice is to adhere to the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds,</b> but with an added emphasis on keeping depletion of the separate air systems [...] "balanced," [...] so that the complete loss of any single gas supply will still leave the diver with sufficient gas to return safely. The <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> makes no allowance for increased air consumption that the stress caused by the loss of an air system may induce. Dissimilar tank sizes among the divers are also not allowed for by the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds,</b> and a sufficient reserve should be calculated for each dive. UK practice is to assume that each diver is completely independent, as in a typical UK sump there is usually nothing that a buddy can do to assist a diver in trouble. Most UK cave divers dive solo. US sump divers follow a similar protocol. The <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> was devised as an approach to diving Florida's caves - they typically have high outflow currents, which help to reduce air consumption when exiting. In a cave system with little or no outflow it is prudent to reserve more air than is provided by the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> {{is applied}} by {{aligning}} a subject with the guide lines and their intersection points, placing the horizon {{on the top}} or bottom line, or allowing linear features in the image to flow from section to section. The main reason for observing the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> is to discourage placement of the subject at the center, or prevent a horizon from appearing to divide the picture in half. Michael Ryan and Melissa Lenos, authors of the book An Introduction to Film Analysis: Technique and Meaning in Narrative Film state {{that the use of}} <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> is [...] "favored by cinematographers in their effort to design balanced and unified images" [...] (page 40).|$|E

40|$|This {{communication}} hypothesises a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> two <b>thirds</b> {{which seems}} to operate in Indian diabetes epidemiology. Two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> all persons with dysglycemia are prediabetic; two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> all persons with diabetes are diagnosed to have the condtion; and two thirds are diagnosed {{before the age of}} 50 years. Two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> people with diabetes have concomitant hypetension or dyslipidemia; two thirds do not get their HbA 1 c assessed; and two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> those who do, do not achiev target values. Yet, two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> people with diabetes report satisfactory psychosocial health and quality of life, and adherence to dietary therapy and medication. Only one thirds adhere to exercise and self monitoring advice, however. Two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> persons on oral glucose lowering drugs receive metformin; two <b>thirds</b> <b>of</b> those on insulin receive premixed insulin or twice daily isnuslin, and a similar proportion uses pens for delivery. Thus, the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> two <b>thirds,</b> rather than <b>of</b> halves, operates in modern Indian diabetes practice...|$|R

5000|$|The {{diagonal}} method (DM) is a rule {{of thumb}} in photography, painting and drawing. Dutch photographer and lecturer Edwin Westhoff discovered the method when, after having long taught the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> in photography courses, he conducted visual experiments to investigate why this <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> only loosely prescribes that points of interest should be placed more or less near the intersection of lines, rather than being rigid and demanding placement to be precisely on these intersections. Having studied many photographs, paintings and etchings, he discovered that details of interest were often placed precisely on the diagonals of a square, instead of any [...] "strong points" [...] that the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> or the photographic adaptation of the golden ratio suggests. A photograph is usually a rectangular shape with a ratio of 4:3 or 3:2, in which case one should look at the bisection of each corner. Manually placing certain elements of interest on these lines results in a more pleasing photograph.|$|E

50|$|The <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> {{is thought}} to be a {{simplification}} of the golden ratio. The golden ratio {{is thought to}} have been used by artists throughout history as a composition guide, but there is little evidence to support this claim.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} rabatment {{can be applied}} to {{rectangles}} of any proportion. For rectangles with a 3:2 ratio (as in 35mm film in still photography), it happens that the rabatment lines are exactly matched to the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> lines.|$|E
50|$|The {{photograph}} to {{the right}} demonstrates {{the application of the}} <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds.</b> The horizon sits at the horizontal line dividing the lower third of the photo from the upper two-thirds. The tree sits at the intersection of two lines, sometimes called a power point or a crash point. Points of interest in the photo do not have to actually touch one of these lines {{to take advantage of the}} <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds.</b> For example, the brightest part of the sky near the horizon where the sun recently set does not fall directly on one of the lines, but does fall near the intersection of two of the lines, close enough to take advantage of the rule.|$|E

40|$|Contracts create binding legal {{relationships}} between the parties to that contract. In Scotland and England, {{those who are not}} parties to a contract - 'third parties' - only gain rights in restricted circumstances. The existing historic common law <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>third</b> party rights in Scotland, known as jus quaesitum tertio, lie adrift of commercial practice through lack of use and uncertainty as to their application in reality. Lack of clarity means that there is what the present writer has termed a 'death spiral': lack of use has meant that there is no opportunity for the case law to be clarified and certainty brought to the law; lack of certainty in the law means that the rights are not used. Indeed, they are often expressly excluded, to avoid the risk of their inadvertent creation - and unexpected claims from unexpected quarters...|$|R
5000|$|As {{one of many}} {{composition}} techniques, rabatment of {{the rectangle}} {{can be used to}} inform the positioning of elements within the rectangle. There is no hard and fast rule regarding such positioning; a composition can have a sense of dynamic unrest or a sense of equilibrium relative to important lines such as ones taken from rabatment or from the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds,</b> or from nodal points such as the [...] "eyes of a rectangle"—the four intersections derived from the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds.</b> Primary image elements can be positioned within one of the two rabatment squares to define the center of interest, and secondary image elements can be placed outside of a rabatment square.|$|E

50|$|Most {{technical}} and overhead-environment divers will maintain the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> as the least conservative option when diving sidemount. Because air-sharing {{will remain a}} possibility while a second diver is present, it is considered good practice that both cylinders retain independent reserves of sufficient gas for both divers to reach the surface safely from any point in the planned dive. {{one third of the}} capacity of the cylinder is considered a simple rule of thumb reserve sufficient for most circumstances, but there are times when it is not enough and times when it will be more than enough. The principle of the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thirds</b> is that one third of the gas supply is available for the penetration, one third for the return and one third is a reserve which allows for gas sharing on the return. Therefore the dive is turned when either cylinder drops to two thirds of total capacity.|$|E
