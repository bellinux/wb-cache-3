500|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. Day {{had become}} a big issue in McCain's home state, with Governor Evan Mecham making {{opposition}} to it his signature stance. [...] McCain had continued {{his opposition to the}} holiday by supporting Mecham's rescinding of the Arizona holiday for King in 1987. [...] In 1988, Mecham was impeached and removed from office due to felony charges. McCain told Mecham, [...] "You should never have been elected. You're an embarrassment to the party." [...] By 1989, McCain reiterated his opposition to the federal holiday, but <b>reversed</b> <b>position</b> on the state holiday, due to the economic boycotts and image problems Arizona was receiving as a result of it not having one. [...] He told Republicans opposing the state holiday, [...] "You will damn well do this. You will make this a holiday. You're making us look like fools." [...] In 1990, a state referendum on enacting the holiday was held; McCain persuaded Ronald Reagan to support it.|$|E

2500|$|The British element {{strongly}} supported {{the war with}} men, money and enthusiasm. So too did the Francophone element until it <b>reversed</b> <b>position</b> in 1915. [...] Given Germany {{as one of the}} Axis Powers, the Canadian government was suspicious of the loyalty of residents of German descent, and anti-German sentiment escalated in the country. The City of Berlin was renamed Kitchener after Britain's top commander. Left-wing anti-war activists also came under attack. In 1917–18 Isaac Bainbridge of Toronto, the dominion secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Canada and editor of its newspaper, Canadian Forward, was charged three times with seditious libel and once with possession of seditious material; he was imprisoned twice.|$|E
2500|$|New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg agreed it was humiliating, but {{defended the}} practice, stating: [...] "If you don't {{want to do}} the perp walk, don't do the crime. I don't have a lot of sympathy for that." [...] New York novelist Jay McInerney observed, [...] "The mayor seems to have {{forgotten}} about the presumption of innocence, but his statement probably reflects the attitude of his constituents pretty accurately. New York's a tough place. Deal with it." [...] Seven weeks later, when doubts about the accuser's credibility made it unlikely the case would be tried, Bloomberg <b>reversed</b> <b>position,</b> stating: [...] "I've always thought perp walks were outrageous...e vilify them for the benefit of theater, for the circus. You know they did it in Roman times, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opponents of {{same-sex}} marriage, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Southern Baptist Convention, and National Organization for Marriage, argue that children do best when {{raised by a}} mother and father, and that legalizing same-sex marriage is, therefore, contrary to {{the best interests of}} children. [...] David Blankenhorn cites the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which says that a child has [...] "the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents," [...] in support of this argument (before he <b>reversed</b> <b>position</b> on the issue). [...] Some same-sex marriage opponents argue that having and raising children is the underlying purpose of marriage. The opponents {{of same-sex}} marriage assume that same-sex unions implicitly lack the everyday ability of opposite-sex couples to produce and raise offspring by natural means. They also argue that children raised by same-sex partners are disadvantaged in various ways and that same-sex unions thus cannot be recognized within the scope of [...] "marriage." [...] The argument that a child has the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents leaves a number of issues open to debate involving same-sex marriage, including infertile heterosexual couples or couples not wishing for children, as well as same-sex unions where a family exists with children from previous relationships, [...] adoption, artificial insemination, surrogacy, or co-parenting. Social consequences are also heavily debated, such as whether marriage should be defined in terms of procreation.|$|E

"The terrible Column {{with slow}} inflexibility advances; cannon (now in <b>reversed</b> <b>position)</b> from that Redoubt d'Eu ('Shame on you, Ingoldsby!'), and {{irregular}} musketry from Fontenoy side, playing upon it; defeated regiments making barriers of their dead men and firing there; Column always closing its gapped ranks, and girdled with insupportable fire. It {{ought to have}} taken Fontenoy and Redoubt d'Eu, say military men; it ought to have done several things! It has now cut the French fairly in two;--and Saxe, who is earnestly surveying it a hundred paces ahead, sends word, conjuring the King to retire instantly,--across the Scheld, by Calonne Bridge and the strong rear-guard there,--who, however, will not. King and Dauphin, on horseback both, have stood 'at the Justice (GALLOWS, in fact) of our Lady of the Woods,' not stirring much, occasionally shifting to a windmill which is still higher,--ye Heavens, with what intrepidity, all day!--'a good many country-folk in trees close behind them.' Country-folk, I suppose, have by this time seen enough, and are copiously making off: but the King will not, though things do look dubious.|$|E
60|$|Before {{they had}} {{returned}} to Ca'stocks Cottage, Undy had succeeded in persuading his friend that the game must be played on--on and on, and out. If a man intends to make a fortune in the share-market he will never do it by being bold one day and timid the next. No turf betting-book {{can be made up}} safely except on consistent principles. Half-measures are always ruinous. In matters of speculation one attempt is made safe by another. No man, it is true, can calculate accurately what may be the upshot of a single venture; but a sharp fellow may calculate with a fair average of exactness what will be the aggregate upshot of many ventures. All mercantile fortunes have been made by the knowledge and understanding of this rule. If a man speculates but once and again, now and then, as it were, he must of course be a loser. He will be playing a game which he does not understand, and playing it against men who do understand it. Men who so play always lose. But he who speculates daily puts himself exactly in the <b>reversed</b> <b>position.</b> He plays a game which experience teaches him to play well, and he plays generally against men who have no such advantage. Of course he wins.|$|E

60|$|The {{compressed}} {{wave of the}} Brezon, more complex in arrangement, was more clearly defined. A section of it was given, showing the <b>reversed</b> <b>position</b> of the Hippurite limestone in the summit and lower precipices. This limestone wave was shown {{to be one of}} a great series, running parallel with the Alps, and constituting an undulatory district, chiefly composed of chalk beds, separated from the higher limestone district of the Jura and Lias by a long trench or moat, filled with members of the tertiary series--chiefly nummulite limestones and flysch. This trench might be followed from Faverges, {{at the head of the}} lake of Annecy, across Savoy. It separated Mont Vergi from the Mont Dorons, and the Dent d'Oche from the Dent du Midi; then entered Switzerland, separating the Moleson from the Diablerets; passed on through the districts of Thun and Brientz, and, dividing itself into two, caused the zigzagged form of the lake of Lucerne. The principal branch then passed between the high Sentis and the Glarnisch, and broke into confusion in the Tyrol. On the north side of this trench the chalk beds were often vertical, or cast into repeated folds, of which the escarpments were mostly turned away from the Alps; but on the south side of the trench, the Jurassic, Triassic, and Carboniferous beds, though much distorted, showed a prevailing tendency to lean towards the Alps, and turn their escarpments to the central chain.|$|E
6000|$|No doubt, {{the novelty}} of the Doctor's <b>reversed</b> <b>position,</b> thus {{standing}} up to receive such a fulmination as the clergy have heretofore arrogated the exclusive right of inflicting, might give additional weight and sting to the words which I found utterance for. But there was another reason (which, had I in the least suspected it, would have closed my lips at once) for his feeling morbidly sensitive to the cruel rebuke that I administered. The unfortunate man had come to me, laboring {{under one of the}} consequences of his riotous outbreak, in the shape of delirium tremens; he bore a hell within the compass of his own breast, all the torments of which blazed up with tenfold inveteracy when I thus took upon myself the Devil's office of stirring up the red-hot embers. His emotions, as well as the external movement and expression of them by voice, countenance, and gesture, were terribly exaggerated by the tremendous vibration of nerves resulting from the disease. It was the deepest tragedy I ever witnessed. I know sufficiently, from that one experience, how a condemned soul would manifest its agonies; and for the future, if I {{have anything to do with}} sinners, I mean to operate upon them through sympathy, and not rebuke. What had I to do with rebuking him? The disease, long latent in his heart, had shown itself in a frightful eruption on the surface of his life. That was all! Is it a thing to scold the sufferer for? ...|$|E
