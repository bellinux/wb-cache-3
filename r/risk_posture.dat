Traditional measures of mortgage risk, such as house appreciation rates and loan-to-value ratios (LTVs), appear to explain some, but not all, {{of the long-term}} trend. In an effort to explain the remaining part of the trend, several non-traditional hypotheses are explored.

40|$|AbstractHolistic {{assessment}} of cyber security risks {{is a complex}} multi-component and multi-level problem involving hardware, software, environmental, and human factors. As part of an on-going effort to develop a holistic, predictive cyber security risk assessment model, the characterization of human factors, which includes human behavior, is needed {{to understand how the}} actions of users, defenders, and attackers affect cyber security risk. The work group developing this new cyber security risk assessment model and framework has chosen to distinguish between trust and confidence by using “trust” only for human factors, and “confidence” for all non-human factors (e. g. hardware and software) in order to reduce confusion between the two concepts within our model. We have developed an initial framework for how to incorporate trust as a factor/parameter within a larger characterization of the human influences (users, defenders and attackers) on cyber security risk. Trust in the human factors is composed of two main categories: inherent characteristics, that which {{is a part of the}} individual, and situational characteristics, that which is outside of the individual. The use of trust as a human factor in holistic cyber security risk assessment will also rely on understanding how differing mental models and <b>risk</b> <b>postures</b> impact the level trust given to an individual and the biases affecting the ability to give said trust...|$|R
40|$|We assess individuals’ {{preferences}} for time paths of reductions in mortality risk yielding a life-expectancy gain {{of about one}} month. In a {{survey of more than}} 1000 French residents, we find substantial coherence and heterogeneity. We elicit pairwise preferences between three perturbations of age- and gender-specific survival curves: transient (reduce hazard for next ten years), additive (reduce hazard in all future years by subtracting a constant), and proportional (reduce hazard in all future years by a common fraction). The preference order implied by these pairwise responses is transitive for 85 percent of respondents. The most common preference orders, accounting for more than half the respondents, are strict indifference, proportional ? additive ? transient, and the inverse of that ranking. These are consistent with globally risk-neutral, risk-seeking, and risk-averse preferences toward longevity, respectively. Choices between one of these scenarios and a latent version that provides no risk reduction for the first 10 or 20 years are consistent with these <b>risk</b> <b>postures.</b> The mean and median consumption-discount rates are 12 and 5 percent per year, respectively, and the average coefficient of relative risk aversion with respect to financial gambles is about 0. 5.

This suggests the need for bringing trust management into running software itself, so that executing soft-ware be guard-railed by policies that reflect <b>risk</b> <b>postures</b> deemed to be appropriate for software and its deployment context. We sketch here an implementation of a prototype that realizes, in part, such a vision. The technical work described below relies on the concept of Trust Evidence. By this we mean any source of information (credentials, reputation, system state, past or present behavior, etc.) {{that can be used in}} order to assess the trustworthi-ness of running a unit of code. The variety of sources for Trust Evidence suggest the need for an extensible language in which such evidence can be combined. The quantitative (e. g. reputation) and qualitative (e. g. a claimed credential) na-ture of such evidence means that such a language has to consistently compose qualitative as well as quantitative notions of Trust Evidence. We here present an exploratory case study (whose usability issues are dis-cussed in [1]) where Scala [2] methods are the units of software that guard rails are meant to control.

40|$|At present, CubeSat {{components}} and buses {{are generally not}} appropriate for missions where significant risk of failure, or the inability to quantify risk or confidence, is acceptable. However, in the future we anticipate that CubeSats {{will be used for}} missions requiring reliability of 1 - 3 years for Earth-observing missions and even longer for Planetary, Heliophysics, and Astrophysics missions. Their growing potential utility is driving an interagency effort to improve and quantify CubeSat reliability, and more generally, small satellite mission risk. The Small Satellite Reliability Initiative (SSRI) —an ongoing activity with broad collaborative participation from civil, DoD, and commercial space systems providers and stakeholders—targets this challenge. The Initiative seeks to define implementable and broadly-accepted approaches to achieve reliability and acceptable <b>risk</b> <b>postures</b> associated with several SmallSat mission risk classes—from “do no harm” missions, to those associated with missions whose failure would result in loss or delay of key national objectives. These approaches will maintain, to the extent practical, cost efficiencies associated with small satellite missions and consider constraints associated with supply chain elements, as appropriate. The SSRI addresses this challenge from two architectural levels—the mission- or system-level, and the component- or subsystem-level. The mission- or system-level scope targets assessment approaches that are efficient and effective, with mitigation strategies that facilitate resiliency to mission or system anomalies while the component- or subsystem-level scope addresses the challenge at lower architectural levels. The initiative does not limit strategies and approaches to proven and traditional methodologies, but is focused on fomenting thought on novel and innovative solutions.

40|$|The Regolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) is {{a student}} {{designed}} and built payload instrument aboard NASA's OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission. The interplanetary target for this mission is a primitive asteroid known as Bennu that {{is believed to be}} relatively unchanged since the formation of the Solar System over 4. 5 billion years ago. The primary goal of REXIS is to provide data to determine the elemental abundance composition of Bennu's surface through the measurement of X-ray fluorescence from Bennu's regolith. Achieving this goal requires the REXIS instrument to have an avionics system designed to operate the x-ray detectors, perform some preliminary processing of the x-ray events detected, and transfer this information to the main spacecraft computer for transmission to Earth. REXIS avionics accomplish these tasks using a mixture of commercial and spaceflight-grade hardware, reconfigurable Xilinx and Actel FPGAs, and a softcore MicroBlaze processor. Although the REXIS instrument is classified as a high-risk Class-D project by NASA, it must safely interface (in the manner of "do no harm") with the low-risk Class-B OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. Furthermore, REXIS must operate in the interplanetary space radiation environment of the OSIRIS-REx mission. This thesis details the REXIS avionics system and its novel features for collecting scientific x- ray data, interfacing safely with the OSIRIS-REx main spacecraft in spite of differing Class B/D <b>risk</b> <b>postures,</b> and robust operation in the interplanetary space radiation environment.

40|$|The REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) is {{a student}} {{collaboration}} instrument aboard the NASA New Frontiers Program's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. Set to launch in 2016 OSIRIS-REx will travel to, survey, and return a sample from the near-earth asteroid Bennu. One of five hosted payloads, REXIS images the asteroid in the soft x-ray spectrum. The REXIS science goals are to classify Bennu among the meteorite groups and spatially map surface elemental distributions. To accomplish this, REXIS carries 4 CCID- 41 detectors sensitive from 0. 5 keV to 7. 0 keV, in order to observe fluoresced x-rays {{from the surface of}} the asteroid. Fluoresced x-rays are dependent on the incident solar x-rays; therefore, REXIS includes a secondary detector to image the solar spectrum simultaneous with REXIS observations of Bennu. This secondary detector, the Solar X-ray Monitor (SXM), consists of a silicon drift diode (SDD) that faces the sun while the REXIS detectors face the asteroid. The SXM provides an energy histogram of x-ray events between 0. 6 keV and 6. 0 keV that is fit to known solar spectral data to provide accurate knowledge of the incident x-ray spectrum at Bennu. As a student collaboration, the REXIS instrument is classified as a high-risk and low-cost payload. The high level requirements for REXIS mission success are to provide students experience in engineering design and project execution, and to do no harm to the host spacecraft. In addition the REXIS project is highly resource constrained in budget, schedule, and personnel. The higher <b>risk</b> <b>posture</b> adopted by the REXIS mission is evidenced in the SXM design. The SDD is a commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) component, and the SXM leverages design heritage from other missions. As an independent subassembly within the REXIS instrument that incorporates many aspects of the REXIS <b>risk</b> <b>posture,</b> including COTS components and design heritage, the SXM can provide insights into the application of risk management to high-risk payload development in general. This thesis presents the engineering design of the REXIS SXM. Overviews are given of structural and thermal components, electronics hardware, and software elements of the design. Additionally this thesis explores the difficulties inherent in creating a balanced <b>risk</b> <b>posture</b> for highly-constrained payload development. First, background on current risk management techniques and applications to high-risk missions are discussed, especially in the context of NASA. Examples of difficulties in high-risk missions are drawn from the REXIS SXM, especially its use of COTS parts and design heritage from other missions. Finally, some conclusions about the risk management of highly constrained missions and suggestions for future work towards a more balanced risk approach are presented. by Michael P. Jones. Thesis: S.

Introducing postural alternatives to the standard procedure (seating and/or raising patient or radiographer), for the most extreme scenarios such as the radiographer being taller or shorter than the patient, can reduce the risk of WRMSDs.|$|R
