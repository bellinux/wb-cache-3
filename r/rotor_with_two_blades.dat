40|$|A {{software}} package is developed for numerical simulation of wind turbine rotors autorotation {{by using the}} modified LS-STAG level-set/cut-cell immersed boundary method. The level-set function is used for immersed boundaries description. Algorithm of level-set function construction for complex-shaped airfoils, based on Bézier curves usage, is proposed. Also, algorithm for the level-set function recalculation at any time without reconstructing the Bézier curve for each new rotor position is described. The designed second-order Butterworth low-pass filter for aerodynamic torque filtration for simulations using coarse grids is presented. To verify the modified LS-STAG method, the flow past autorotating Savonius <b>rotor</b> <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>blades</b> was simulated at Re= 1. 96 · 105...|$|E
25|$|Despite severe {{material}} shortages, work on {{the experimental}} design started in 1948, and the main designer became Bronisław Żurakowski (brother of test pilot Janusz Żurakowski), who designed the helicopter rotor and the control system. It used simpler Hiller <b>rotor</b> type, <b>with</b> <b>two</b> auxiliary <b>blades.</b> The structure of the fuselage, tail boom, auxiliary rotor and tricycle undercarriage were designed by Tadeusz Chyliński. The power unit and final drive were designed by Zbigniew Brzoska. The design utilized some components left by the Germans, like a piston engine Hirth HM 504 (re-configured for vertical use), rear gear from a Zündapp motorcycle and wheels from a DFS Kranich glider's jettisonable landing gear.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of research were {{to understand the}} influence of the installation of guide vane on the performance of Savonius wind turbine and to acknowledge the number of rotor blade which produces the most maximum performance. There are three variations for the number of rotor blade, which are 2, 3 and 4 blades on the range of wind speed are 4 - 7 m/s. Result of research indicated that <b>rotor</b> <b>with</b> three blades can give better performance than <b>rotor</b> <b>with</b> <b>two</b> and four <b>blades.</b> <b>Rotor</b> <b>with</b> guide vane has produced better performance in power coefficient rate for 0, 3638 at wind speed 5 m/s, while rotor without guide vane can only provide power coefficient for 0, 2595 at similar wind speed 5 m/s...|$|R
40|$|The modal {{dynamics}} of structures <b>with</b> bladed isotropic <b>rotors</b> is analyzed using Hill's method. First, analytical derivation of the periodic system matrix shows that isotropic <b>rotors</b> <b>with</b> more than <b>two</b> <b>blades</b> {{can be represented}} by an exact Fourier series with 3 /rev (three per rotor revolution) as the highest order. For two-bladed rotors, the inverse mass matrix has an infinite Fourier series with harmonic components of decreasing norm; thus, the system matrix can be approximated by a truncated Fourier series of predictable accuracy. Second, a novel method for automatically identifying the principal solutions of Hill's eigenvalue problem is introduced. The corresponding periodic eigenvectors {{can be used to}} compute symmetric and antisymmetric components of the two-bladed rotor motion, as well as the additional forward and backward whirling components for <b>rotors</b> <b>with</b> more than <b>two</b> <b>blades.</b> To illustrate the use of these generic methods, a simple wind turbine model is set up with three degrees of freedom for each blade and seven degrees of freedom for the nacelle and drivetrain. First, the model parameters are tuned such that the low-order modal {{dynamics of}} a three-bladed 10  MW turbine from previous studies is recaptured. Second, one blade is removed, leading to larger and higher harmonic terms in the system matrix. These harmonic terms lead to modal couplings for the two-bladed turbine that do not exist for the three-bladed turbine. A single mode of a two-bladed turbine will also have several resonance frequencies in both the ground-fixed and rotating frames of reference, which complicates the interpretation of simulated or measured turbine responses...|$|R
30|$|Wind turbine {{aerodynamics}} must {{be designed}} for optimal output {{to exploit the}} wind energy in a specific location. Diaz et al.[2] analyzed the drag and lift coefficients of a Savonius wind turbine to quantify the aerodynamic performance of the rotor. They found that maximum efficiency, in terms of power coefficient, occurs at a tip speed ratio of λ[*]=[*] 1, and the drag coefficient decreases sharply when the tip speed ratio increases or decreases from this value. They {{also found that the}} most important region of Savonius rotor operation occurs at a tip speed ratio around λ[*]=[*] 1, where the lift coefficient remains as a constant 0.5. Sawada et al.[3] studied the mechanism of rotation of a Savonius <b>rotor</b> <b>with</b> <b>two</b> semi-cylindrical <b>blades</b> and found that a <b>rotor</b> <b>with</b> a gap ratio of 0.21 produces positive static torque at all angles. They also found that lift force contributes significantly to dynamic torque, while the rotor angle is between α[*]=[*] 240 ° and α[*]=[*] 330 °. Aldoss and Obeidat[4] used the discrete vortex method to analyze the performance of two Savonius rotors running side-by-side at different separations. They compared their computational results on torque and power coefficients with their experimental results for verification. Fujisawa and Gotoh[5] studied the aerodynamic performance of a Savonius rotor by measuring pressure distribution on the blade surfaces at various rotor angles and tip speed ratios. Torque and power performance, evaluated by integrating the pressure, were in close agreement with direct torque measurements.|$|R
