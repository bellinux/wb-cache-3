40|$|It {{has often}} been {{suggested}} that differential usage of codons recognized by rare tRNA species, i. e. "rare codons", represents an evolutionary strategy to modulate gene expression. In particular, <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes</b> are reported to have an extraordinarily high frequency of rare codons. From E. coli we have compiled codon usage data for highly expressed genes, moderately/lowly expressed <b>genes,</b> and <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes.</b> We have identified a clear and general trend in codon usage bias, from the very high bias seen in very highly expressed genes and attributed to selection, to a rather low bias in other genes {{which seems to be}} more influenced by mutation than by selection. There is no clear tendency for an increased frequency of rare codons in the <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes,</b> compared to a large group of other moderately/lowly expressed genes with low codon bias. From this, as well as a consideration of evolutionary rates of <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes,</b> and of experimental data on translation rates, we conclude that the pattern of synonymous codon usage in <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes</b> reflects primarily the relaxation of natural selection...|$|R

25|$|Evans et al. (2006) had {{previously}} {{suggested that a}} group of alleles collectively known as haplogroup D of microcephalin, a critical <b>regulatory</b> <b>gene</b> for brain volume, originated from an archaic human population. The results show that haplogroup D introgressed 37,000 years ago (based on the coalescence age of derived D alleles) into modern humans from an archaic human population that separated 1.1 million years ago (based on the separation time between D and non-D alleles), consistent with the period when Neanderthals and modern humans co-existed and diverged respectively. The high frequency of the D haplogroup (70%) suggest that it was positively selected for in modern humans. The distribution of the D allele of microcephalin is high outside Africa but low in sub-Saharan Africa, which further suggest that the admixture event happened in archaic Eurasian populations. This distribution difference between Africa and Eurasia suggests that the D allele originated from Neanderthals according to Lari et al. (2010), but they found that a Neanderthal individual from the Mezzena Rockshelter (Monti Lessini, Italy) was homozygous for an ancestral allele of microcephalin, thus providing no support that Neanderthals contributed the D allele to modern humans and also not excluding the possibility of a Neanderthal origin of the D allele. Green et al. (2010), having analyzed the Vindija Neanderthals, also could not confirm a Neanderthal origin of haplogroup D of the microcephalin gene.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} DCC in {{this form}} of dosage {{compensation}} was postulated by Barbara J. Meyer in the 1980s, and its individual components and their cooperative function were later parsed out by her lab. Notably, in 1999, data from Meyer’s lab showed that SDC-2 is a particularly important transcriptional factor for targeting the DCC to the X chromosome and for assembling DCC components onto the X chromosomes in XX embryos. More recently, Meyer’s lab has shown that proteins known as X-linked signal elements (XSEs) operate in concert with SDC-2 to differentially repress and activate other genes in the dosage compensation pathway. By selectively mutating a panel of genes hypothesized to contribute to dosage compensation in worms, Meyer’s group demonstrated which XSEs specifically {{play a role in}} determining normal dosage compensation. They found that during embryonic development, several X-linked genes—including sex-1, sex-2, fox-1, and ceh-39—act in a combinatorial fashion to selectively repress transcriptional activity of the xol-1 gene in hermaphrodites. Xol-1 expression is tightly regulated during early development, and is considered the most upstream gene in sex determination of C. elegans. In fact, xol-1 is often referred to in the literature as the master sex <b>regulatory</b> <b>gene</b> of C. elegans. XX C. elegans embryos have much lower xol-1 expression than their XO counterparts, resulting from overall increases in the amount of SEX-1, SEX-2, CEH-39, and FOX-1 transcription produced in the female embryos. This consequent decrease in xol-1 expression then allows higher SDC-2 expression levels, which aids in the formation and function of the DCC complex in the XX hermaphroditic worms, and in turn results in equalized expression of X-linked genes in the hermaphrodite.|$|E

Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, the present study compared the expression of about 50 <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes</b> that are expressed at early stages of neurogenesis in five human NBs and NETs, also upon GDNF/TGF-β 1 and retinoic acid (RA) treatment.

40|$|Animal {{development}} is an elaborate process programmed by genomic <b>regulatory</b> instructions. <b>Regulatory</b> <b>genes</b> encode transcription factors and signal molecules, and their expression {{is under the}} control of cis-regulatory modules that define the logic of transcriptional responses to the inputs of other <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes.</b> The functional linkages among <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes</b> constitute the <b>gene</b> <b>regulatory</b> networks (GRNs) that govern cell specification and patterning in development. Constructing such networks requires identification of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes</b> involved and characterization of their temporal and spatial expression patterns. Interactions (activation/repression) among transcription factors or signals can be investigated by large-scale perturbation analysis, in which the function of each gene is specifically blocked. Resultant expression changes are then integrated to identify direct linkages, and to reveal the structure of the GRN. Predicted GRN linkages can be tested and verified by cis-regulatory analysis. The explanatory power of the GRN was shown in the lineage specification of sea urchin endomesoderm. Acquiring such networks is essential for a systematic and mechanistic understanding of the developmental process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnimal {{development}} {{is controlled by}} gene regulation networks that are composed of sequence-specific transcription factors (TF) and cell signaling molecules (ST). Although housekeeping genes {{have been reported to}} show clustering in the animal genomes, whether the genes comprising a given regulatory network are physically clustered on a chromosome is uncertain. We examined this question in the present study. Ascidians are the closest living relatives of vertebrates, and their tadpole-type larva represents the basic body plan of chordates. The Ciona intestinalis genome contains 390 core TF genes and 119 major ST genes. Previous gene disruption assays led to the formulation of a basic chordate embryonic blueprint, based on over 3000 genetic interactions among 79 zygotic <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes.</b> Here, we mapped the <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes,</b> including all 79 <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes,</b> on the 14 pairs of Ciona chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Chromosomal localization of upstream and downstream <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes</b> demonstrates that the components of coherent developmental gene networks are evenly distributed over the 14 chromosomes. Thus, this study provides the first comprehensive evidence that the physical clustering of <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes,</b> or their target genes, is not relevant for the genome-wide control of gene expression during development...|$|R

First diagnosis of aHUS is often made in the context of an initial, complement-triggering infection, and Shiga-toxin has also been implicated as a trigger that identifies patients with aHUS. Additionally, in one study, [...] mutations of genes encoding several complement regulatory proteins were detected in 8 of 36 (22%) patients diagnosed with STEC-HUS. However, the absence of an identified complement <b>regulatory</b> <b>gene</b> mutation does not preclude aHUS as the cause of the TMA, as approximately 50% of patients with aHUS lack an identifiable mutation in complement regulatory genes.|$|E

The phenotypes of these mutants strongly suggested that the mutations reside in <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes.</b> Using these mutant strains, we showed that multiple <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes</b> are required {{for the expression of}} the lectin structural genes and that these <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes</b> (the dis+ alleles) act in trans to regulate this <b>gene</b> family. These <b>regulatory</b> <b>genes</b> fall into two complementation groups (disA and disB) and map to linkage groups II and III, respectively. A further regulatory locus was defined by the identification of an unlinked supressor gene, drsA (discoidin restoring), which is epistatic to disB, but not disA, and results in the restoration of lectin expression in cells carrying the disB mutation. Mutant cells carrying the drsA allele express the discoidin lectin gene family during growth and development, in contrast to wild-type cells which express it only during development. Therefore, the suppressor activity of the drsA allele appears to function by making the expression of the discoidin lectins constitutive and no longer strictly developmentally regulated. The data indicate that normal expression of the discoidin lectins is dependent on the sequential action of the disB+, drsA+, and disA+ gene products.
