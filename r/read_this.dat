5|$|In a {{footnote}} to Chapter XIII, Poe {{refers to the}} Polly, a wreck which drifted for six months across the Atlantic Ocean in 1811-1812. Poe probably <b>read</b> <b>this</b> history in an 1836 book by R. Thomas, Remarkable Events and Remarkable Shipwrecks, from which he quotes verbatim.|$|E
5|$|I <b>read</b> <b>this</b> book, and I {{was totally}} stunned. At {{the same time}} I was pretty upset with myself that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
5|$|Forster wrote well-polished German prose, {{which was}} not only scientifically {{accurate}} and objective, but also exciting and easy to <b>read.</b> <b>This</b> differed from conventional travel literature of the time, insofar as it presented {{more than a mere}} collection of data – it also demonstrated coherent, colourful and reliable ethnographical facts that resulted from detailed and sympathetic observation. He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations. His main focus was always on the people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In A Voyage Round the World he even presented the songs sung by the people of Polynesia, complete with lyrics and notation. The book {{is one of the most}} important sources concerning the societies of the Southern Pacific from the times before European influence had become significant.|$|E

5|$|In actuality, Boyce {{stopped in}} London {{en route to}} a safari in British East Africa. It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street; he did not take him to the Scout {{headquarters}} and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked up a copy of Scouting For Boys and other printed material on Scouting. He <b>read</b> <b>this</b> while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention fog, a 1928 account says there was fog. Climatologists report no fog on that day in London.|$|E
5|$|Kenney <b>read</b> <b>this</b> Ultra {{intelligence}} {{in the office of}} the Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area – General Douglas MacArthur – on 25 February. The prospect of an additional 6,900 Japanese troops in the Lae area greatly disturbed MacArthur, as they might seriously affect his plans to capture and develop the area. Kenney wrote out orders, which were sent by courier, for Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead, the deputy commander of the Fifth Air Force, and the commander of its Advance Echelon (ADVON) in New Guinea. Under the Fifth Air Force’s unusual command arrangements, Whitehead controlled the Allied Air Forces units of all types in New Guinea. This included the RAAF units there, which were grouped as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, under the command of Air Commodore Joe Hewitt.|$|E

25|$|Rapid automatized naming: The {{ability to}} say quickly {{the names of}} letters, objects and colors predicts an individual's ability to <b>read.</b> <b>This</b> might {{be linked to the}} {{importance}} of quick retrieval of phonological representations from long-term memory in reading and the importance of object-naming circuits in the left cerebral hemisphere that are recruited to underpin a child's word-recognition abilities.|$|E

25|$|This did not suffice, however. Franklin {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a subscription library, which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to <b>read.</b> <b>This</b> was the birth of the Library Company of Philadelphia: its charter was composed by Franklin in 1731. In 1732, Franklin hired the first American librarian, Louis Timothee. The Library Company is now a great scholarly and research library.|$|E
25|$|This {{novel was}} first issued in the UK in 1977 by Collins and in 1978 in the US by Stein & Day.

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that García Lorca was apolitical and had many friends in both Republican and Nationalist camps. Gibson {{disputes}} this in his 1978 book about the poet's death. He cites, for example, Mundo Obrero's published manifesto, which Lorca later signed, and alleges that Lorca was an active supporter of the Popular Front. Lorca <b>read</b> <b>this</b> manifesto out loud at a banquet in honour of fellow poet Rafael Alberti on 9 February 1936.|$|E

Barton played in ten non-first-class matches on the tour and in the only match against a South African XI at Newlands Cricket Ground which was later recognised as a Test match.

25|$|After a near-incident with Spanish {{forces at}} Natchitoches, Wilkinson decided he could best serve his {{conflicting}} interests by betraying Burr's plans to President Jefferson {{and to his}} Spanish paymasters. Jefferson issued an order for Burr's arrest, declaring him a traitor before any indictment. Burr <b>read</b> <b>this</b> in a newspaper in the Territory of Orleans on January 10, 1807. Jefferson's warrant put Federal agents on his trail. Burr twice turned himself in to the Federal authorities. Two judges found his actions legal and released him.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{functions}} of the cathedral is the reading and expounding upon the Holy Scripture. The cathedral generally has a lectern from which the scripture is <b>read.</b> <b>This</b> often takes the form of an eagle of brass or carved wood which supports the book on its outstretched wings and is the symbol of John the Evangelist. However, some cathedrals retain elaborate medieval structures {{on either side of the}} church, one for the reading of the Gospel and the other for the reading of the Epistle.|$|E

25|$|In 1921, Dange {{published}} a pamphlet titled Gandhi Vs. Lenin, a {{comparative study of}} approaches of both the leaders; but, Lenin coming out as better of the two. This work {{proved to be a}} turning point in Dange's life. Prominent Marxist leader M.N. Roy read the work and went on to meet its young author, when he came to Mumbai. Ranchoddas Bhavan Lotvala, a flour mill owner from Mumbai who 'concerned himself for radical causes', also <b>read</b> <b>this</b> treatise and was impressed by its contents. Lotvala sponsored Dange's study of Marxism for several years, and together they built up a library of Marxist Literature and published translations of classics.|$|E
