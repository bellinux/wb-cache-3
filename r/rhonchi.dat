5000|$|Several sources {{will also}} refer to [...] "medium" [...] crackles, as a {{crackling}} sound {{that seems to}} fall between the course and fine crackles. Crackles are defined as discreet sounds that last less than 20 ms, while the continuous sounds (<b>rhonchi</b> and wheezes) last approximately 250 ms.

Since the mid-1990s, it has no longer been considered appropriate terminology in auscultation of the thorax, as much confusion {{has been reported in}} the published literature which confuses this with crepitations and wheezes, so the exact nature of this term is unclear (see Fleischner Society for standardized terminology).|$|E
50|$|Mendelson's {{syndrome}} is characterised by a bronchopulmonary reaction following aspiration of gastric contents during general anaesthesia due to {{abolition of the}} laryngeal reflexes. The main clinical features are signs of general hypoxia, two to five hours after anaesthesia. Such features may include cyanosis, dyspnea, fever, pulmonary wheeze, crepitant rales, <b>rhonchi,</b> and tachycardia with a low blood pressure. Decreased arterial oxygen tension {{is also likely to}} be evident. Pulmonary edema can cause sudden death or death may occur later from pulmonary complications.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of alpha-1 antitrypsin {{deficiency}} include shortness of breath, wheezing, <b>rhonchi,</b> and rales. The patient's symptoms may resemble recurrent respiratory infections or asthma {{that does not}} respond to treatment. Individuals with A1AD may develop emphysema during their thirties or forties even without a history of significant smoking, though smoking greatly increases the risk for emphysema. A1AD causes impaired liver function in some patients and may lead to cirrhosis and liver failure (15%). In newborns, alpha-1 {{antitrypsin deficiency}} has indicators that include early onset jaundice followed by prolonged jaundice. It is a leading indication for liver transplantation in newborns.|$|E
50|$|His {{clinical}} work {{allowed him}} to follow chest patients from bedside to the autopsy table. He was therefore able to correlate sounds captured by his new instruments with specific pathological changes in the chest, in effect pioneering a new non-invasive diagnostic tool. Pulmonary phthisis, for example, was one ailment he could more clearly identify using his knowledge of typical and atypical chest sounds. Laennec {{was the first to}} classify and discuss the terms rales, <b>rhonchi,</b> crepitance, and egophony - terms that doctors now use on a daily basis during physical exams and diagnoses. In February 1818, he presented his findings in a talk at the Académie de Médecine, later publishing his findings in 1819.|$|E
50|$|The {{most obvious}} sign that {{meconium}} {{has been passed}} during or before labor is the greenish or yellowish appearance of the amniotic fluid. The infant's skin, umbilical cord, or nailbeds may be stained green if the meconium was passed {{a considerable amount of}} time before birth. These symptoms alone do not necessarily indicate that the baby has inhaled in the fluid by gasping in utero or after birth. After birth, rapid or labored breathing, cyanosis, slow heartbeat, a barrel-shaped chest or low Apgar score are all signs of the syndrome. Inhalation can be confirmed by one or more tests such as using a stethoscope to listen for abnormal lung sounds (diffuse 'wet' crackles and <b>rhonchi),</b> performing blood gas tests to confirm a severe loss of lung function (respiratory acidosis as a consequence of hypercapnia), and using chest X-rays to look for patchy or streaked areas on the lungs. Infants who have inhaled meconium may develop respiratory distress syndrome often requiring ventilatory support. Complications of MAS include pneumothorax and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.|$|E
40|$|Ten {{patients}} with chronic bronchitis were treated in a double-blind crossover study during two separate acute bacterial exacerbations, once with 320 mg of trimethoprim (TMP) and 1, 600 mg of sulfamethoxazole daily, and once with ampicillin, 2 g daily, each for 14 days. Patients were observed initially, twice a week during therapy and weekly after therapy. Graded clinical observations in-cluded frequency and severity of cough, dyspnea, rales and <b>rhonchi,</b> breath sounds, prolongation of expiration, and vital signs.

40|$|Erdosteine has {{positive}} effects on mucus rheology and transport due to the active metabolite (Metabolite 1) which contains a free thiol group. Erdosteine inhibits bacterial adhesiveness and has antioxidant properties. A synergistic effect of erdosteine with various antibiotics has been demonstrated in pharmacological and clinical studies. The present study was multicenter, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled. The aims {{of the study were}} to compare a combination of erdosteine with amoxicillin against an amoxicillin-placebo combination in pediatric patients with acute lower respiratory tract disease. A total of 158 patients (78 in the erdosteine group and 80 in the placebo group) were treated for 7 2 days. The efficacy parameters were cough (primary), polypnea, <b>rhonchi,</b> rales and body temperature (all measured at baseline, on Day 3 {{and at the end of}} treatment). Safety was assessed by strictly monitoring the occurrence of adverse events and using standard laboratory parameters. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis showed that the severity of cough was decreased by 47 % at Day 3 in the erdosteine group with a statistically significant difference compared to placebo, the difference was still significant at the final visit. The decrease in the severity of rales was significantly greater at Day 3 in the erdosteine group than in the placebo group. The incidence of polypnea and <b>rhonchi</b> in the two groups showed similar decreases, an improvement mainly due to the antibiotic. No adverse events occurred and no adverse changes in laboratory parameters were observed. It is concluded that the combination of erdosteine and amoxicillin is a safe medication which is clinically superior to that of the antibiotic combined with placebo, especially in regard to the effects on cough...|$|E
30|$|Adventitious {{pulmonary}} sounds can {{be divided}} into five categories: wheezes, crackles, stridors, squawks and <b>rhonchi.</b> Although stethoscope is widely used by physicians as a simple, non-invasive tool for the auscultation of pulmonary sounds, it has been regarded as a tool with low diagnostic value, not only because pulmonary sounds for each patient are significantly different and they change for the same patient over time, but also because it is a subjective process that depends on the experience and hearing capability of physician. Stethoscope is not an ideal acoustic instrument either; it attenuates frequency components of pulmonary sounds above 120 Hz by making it impossible for the physician to hear pathological sounds of higher frequencies. Moreover, auscultation with stethoscope does not allow long term monitoring of pulmonary sounds.|$|E

Instrumentation used to collect data included microphones, stethoscopes, and accelerometers. Several references obtained data from online repositories or book audio CD companions.

Two main features of this methodology are: the use of symbolic knowledge about the signal sources (in addition to sensory inputs), and fusion of multisensor information.

We also compare the performance of the resulting algorithm with both a single-sensor system and with a system that selects features using an entropy-based criterion. To evaluate the methodology we used both normal lung sounds (bronchial and vesicular) as well as adventitious sounds (<b>rhonchi,</b> wheezes and crackles).
