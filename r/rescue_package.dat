40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} market {{reaction}} to bank <b>rescue</b> <b>packages</b> announced in six countries between October 2008 and January 2009. The study distinguishes {{the impact on}} creditors {{as seen in the}} change of CDS spreads from the impact on shareholders as seen in the movement of bank stock prices. Government interventions benefited creditors at the expense of shareholders, with bank CDS spreads narrowing around the announcements in all cases. Despite a brief positive reaction, bank stock prices continued to underperform in all countries except the United States where the favourable terms of the government support allowed bank stocks to outperform. banking, <b>rescue</b> <b>packages,</b> stock prices, CDS spreads, financial crisis, event study...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{a dynamic}} panel {{approach}} {{to explain the}} determinants of widening sovereign bond yield spreads vis- 0 -vis Germany in selected euro area countries during the period end-July 2007 to end-March 2009, when the financial turmoil developed into a full-blown financial and economic crisis. Emphasis {{is given to the}} role of fiscal fundamentals and government announcements of substantial bank <b>rescue</b> <b>packages.</b> The paper finds that higher expected budget deficits and/or higher government debt ratios relative to Germany contributed to higher government bond yield spreads in the euro area during the analysed period. More importantly, the announcements of bank <b>rescue</b> <b>packages</b> have led to a re-assessment, from the part of investors, of sovereign credit risk, first and foremost through a transfer of risk from the private financial sector to the government...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{effectiveness}} of the financial sector <b>rescue</b> <b>packages</b> provided by the national governments during the 2008 financial crisis. This study questions the implicit assumption that government interventions have an uniform effect on the default risk of individual banks. After testing the results for sensitivity, our main findings suggest that there exists a significant negative relationship between the announcement of the financial sector <b>rescue</b> <b>packages</b> and the daily change of the credit default premium. However, quantile regressions show that {{the effectiveness of}} these packages differs across banks: most interventions do not decrease the risk of intermediate to low-risk banks, while they do reduce the risk of high-risk banks. Besides, we find that interventions aimed at specific financial institutions are more effective in restraining banking risk than broad interventions taken to stabilize the financial market as a whole...|$|R

25|$|Brazil {{received}} an International Monetary Fund <b>rescue</b> <b>package</b> in mid-2002 of $30.4billion, then a record sum. Brazil's central bank paid back the IMF loan in 2005, {{although it was}} not due to be repaid until 2006. One of the issues the Central Bank of Brazil recently dealt with was an excess of speculative short-term capital inflows to the country, which may have contributed to a fall {{in the value of the}} U.S. dollar against the real during that period. Nonetheless, foreign direct investment (FDI), related to long-term, less speculative investment in production, is estimated to be $193.8billion for 2007.

40|$|As {{the global}} banking crisis {{intensified}} {{in the fall}} of 2008, governments announced comprehensive <b>rescue</b> <b>packages</b> for financial institutions. In this paper, we put the joint response of euro area bank and sovereign CDS premia under the microscope. We find that the bank <b>rescue</b> <b>packages</b> led to a clear structural break in these premia’s comovement, which had been rather tight and stable in the weeks preceding the intensification of the crisis. Firstly, the packages induced a decrease in risk spreads for banks at the expense of a marked increase in risk spreads for governments. Secondly, we show that in addition to this one-off jump in the levels of CDS spreads, the packages strongly increased the sensitivity of sovereign risk spreads to any further aggravation of the crisis. At the same time, the sensitivity of bank credit risk premia declined and became more sovereign-like, reflecting the extensive government guarantees of banking sector liabilities.

25|$|After a {{long period}} of very high growth of GDP, the GDP of Estonia {{decreased}} by a little over 3% on a yearly basis in the 3rd quarter of 2008. In the 4th quarter of 2008 the negative growth was already −9.4%. Some international experts and journalists, who like to view the three Baltic states as a single economic identity, have failed to notice that Estonia has constantly performed better than Lithuania and Latvia on many fundamental indicators. Still, in 2009 Estonia was one of the five worst performing economies in {{the world in terms of}} annual GDP growth rate. The current account deficit and inflation is lower than in Latvia, the GDP per capita is higher than in Latvia and Lithuania, Estonia's public debt is a very low 3.8% of GDP and government reserves are close to 10% of GDP. The difference is exemplified by the fact that in December 2008 Estonia became one of the donor countries to the IMF lead <b>rescue</b> <b>package</b> for Latvia.|$|E

He traces the crisis through its three interrelated origins: financial sector weaknesses; external sector problems; and the contagion that spread from Thailand to other countries.
