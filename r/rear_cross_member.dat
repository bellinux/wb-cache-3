The Series II update featured {{the addition of a}} new <b>rear</b> <b>cross</b> <b>member,</b> revised rear control arm assemblies with new style bushing and toe-control links to the semi-trailing arm rear suspension to better maintain the toe settings during suspension movements, resulting in more predictable car handling, noticeably over uneven surfaces, and improved tyre wear.|$|E
50|$|However the insuperable {{problem was}} the {{proximity}} of the engine to the rear axle, and on 33 ft versions many different designs of drive-shaft were employed but no effective way was found of insulating the engine and gearbox from road shocks. Crosville had all of its 36 ft models converted with a revised engine and gearbox mounting closer to the <b>rear</b> <b>cross</b> <b>member,</b> allowing a longer universal-jointed drive shaft to be put in place, this arrangement was also applied to later long-wheelbase RU as built. To cover for vehicles being modified, Seddon Atkinson lent Crosville the prototype Pennine 7 (UBU72N), which remained with Crosville after the work was done.|$|E
5000|$|Jim Sambrooks of Doncaster Corporation and South Yorkshire PTE {{recalled}} a Doncaster engineering foreman saying [...] "If it's a Seddon it's a dead 'un." [...] Again {{referring to the}} unlikelihood of pulling up in a straight line, he also recalled the first batch had car-type handbrake levers which disintegrated in use; later upon becoming a fitter he discovered that the brake adjusters (of two different sorts on the different batches) were virtually inaccessible, that spring shackle-pins often needed to be knocked out which was equally difficult, that topping up the fluid flywheel was [...] "nigh-on impossible" [...] and only done when a bus developed gearbox-slip, and {{that in order to}} remove the engines for overhaul, Doncaster engineers actually had to cut-away the <b>rear</b> <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> and bolt in a removable piece of girder once they had done. Problems on the Doncaster Pennine bodies included rivets falling out and frame-fractures above the exit door.|$|E
50|$|The {{back axle}} was of spiral bevel type with ratios between 4.4:1 and 5.6:1. A short torque tube ran {{forward from the}} {{differential}} housing to a bearing and bracket on the <b>rear</b> axle <b>cross</b> <b>member.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{exhibit at}} the 1964 show was a Manchester Corporation unit with a Park Royal body derived from the BET design, but {{featuring}} deeper windows forward of the exit door. The reviewer for Buses Illustrated noted the unladen weight was 6.5 tons, even though the body was 'well-finished'. The two bodied Panthers on show-stands were for Glasgow and Hull and had, respectively an Alexander body weighing 7ton, 8.75cwt and a Charles H Roe body tipping the scales at 7ton 6cwt. Thus a bodied Panther Cub weighed almost one ton less than the equivalent Panther. Interestingly although the chassis type is widely quoted as [...] "PSRC1/1", the designation engraved on the <b>rear</b> chassis <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> of preserved example BND 874C is simply [...] "P/C".|$|R

50|$|Whereas the RE used {{a complex}} stepped frame on bus variants. Seddon {{decided to use}} a {{straight}} frame using 8in channel longitudinals and mainly tubular cross-members which was oriented to rise from front to rear at about 5 degrees from the horizontal. Wheelbases offered were either 16 ft 6in for 33 ft coachwork or 18 ft 6in for 36 ft bodies. Instead of the complex drive-line arrangement of the RE a straightforward T-drive layout was employed. The rear end of the 10.45-litre Gardner 6HLX (the 8.6 litre 6HLW was optional) was mounted below and hard against the <b>rear</b> <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> on the short version, driving directly via a fluid flywheel into a Self-Changing Gears 4 or 5-speed direct-operating epicyclic gearbox, air-operated with electrical control. The Eaton spiral-bevel rear axle, {{to a variety of}} different final drive ratios, was just ahead of the power pack and a very short drive shaft was fitted with resilient rubber-based joints. Originally on the long-wheelbase version a similar arrangement was employed but with the engine further {{from the rear of the}} frame. Conventional leaf springs were used, but the spring shackle-pins were fitted with polyurethane bushes, which would not require greasing and so reduce maintenance costs. The braking was full air-operated using Girling wedge-type drum brakes. A spring operated air parking-brake was employed, power steering for the Seddon-designed front-axle was optionally available. Unlike the RE and the Leyland Panther the radiator was not carried at the front but hung from the offside of the chassis in mid-wheelbase, ahead of the rear axle. A combined saloon heating and ventilation system with a thermostatically-controlled heat-exchanger and reversible fan drive was announced but this was never made available to customers.|$|E

40|$|Trusses {{used for}} roof support in coal mines are {{constructed}} of two grouted bolts installed at opposing forty-five degree angles into {{the roof and}} a <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> that ties the angled bolts together. The load on the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is vertical, which is transverse to the longitudinal axis, and therefore the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is loaded in the weakest direction. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the vertical load capacity and deflection of three different types of <b>cross</b> <b>members.</b> Single-point load tests, with the load applied {{in the center of}} the specimen and double-point load tests, with a span of 2. 4 m, were conducted. For the single-point load configuration, the yield of the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> was nominally 98 kN of vertical load, achieved at 42 cm of deflection. For cable <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> yield was not achieved even after 45 cm of deflection. Peak vertical loads were about 89 kN for 17 mm cables and 67 kN for the 15 mm cables. For the double-point load configurations, the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> yielded at 150 kN of vertical load and 25 cm of deflection. At 25 cm of deflection individual cable strands started breaking at 133 and 111 kN of vertical load for the 17 and 15 mm cable <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> respectively.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{infrared}} (IR) local heating method drastically reduces springback of advanced high-strength steels (AHSSs). Though the IR local heating method saves heating energy because it utilizes focused IR rays to heat only the plastic deformation zone, there has yet to be an attempt to show that the heating method can be applied to industrial manufacturing processes. In this work, the IR local heating method is used to manufacture a seat <b>cross</b> <b>member.</b> Seat <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> require high strength because they are responsible for protecting passengers from broadside collisions. Although AHSS is preferred in seat <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> the large amount of springback of AHSS makes a problem in the accuracy of the shape. This work verifies that the IR local heating method is able to make the seat <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> with the target shape in the manufacturing process. A thermo-mechanical analysis was also conducted with the finite element method to discuss the springback results...|$|R
