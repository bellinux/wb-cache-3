In the general case, an automated routing assistant may not know the driver’s final destination and may need to consider probabilities over destinations in identifying the ideal waypoint along with the revised route that includes the waypoint. We consider general principles of opportunistic routing and present the results of several studies with a corpus of real-world trips. Then, we describe how we can compute the expected value of asking a user about the primary destination so as to remove uncertainty about the goal and show how this measure can guide an automated system’s engagements with users when making recommendations for navigation and analogous settings in ubiquitous computing...|$|R

40|$|The Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN) is a {{component}} of the global DECnet Internet, which has over 17, 000 host computers. The growth of SPAN from its implementation in 1981 to its present size of well over 2, 500 registered SPAN host computers, has created a need for users to acquire timely information about the network through a central source. The SPAN Network Information Center (SPAN-NIC) an online facility managed by the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) was developed to meet this need for SPAN-wide information. The remote node descriptive information in this document is not currently contained in the SPAN-NIC database, but will be incorporated in the near future. Access to this information is also available to non-DECnet users over a variety of networks such as Telenet, the NASA Packet Switched System (NPSS), and the TCP/IP Internet. This publication serves as the Yellow Pages for SPAN node information. The document also provides key information concerning other computer networks connected to SPAN, nodes associated with each SPAN <b>routing</b> <b>center,</b> science discipline nodes, contacts for primary SPAN nodes, and SPAN reference information. A section on DECnet Internetworking discusses SPAN connections with other wide-area DECnet networks (many with thousands of nodes each). Another section lists node names and their disciplines, countries, and institutions in the SPAN Network Information Center Online Data Base System. All remote sites connected to US-SPAN and European-SPAN (E-SPAN) are indexed. Also provided is information on the SPAN tail circuits, i. e., those remote nodes connected directly to a SPAN <b>routing</b> <b>center,</b> which is the local point of contact for resolving SPAN-related problems. Reference material is included for those who wish to know more about SPAN. Because of the rapid growth of SPAN, the SPAN Yellow Pages is reissued periodically...|$|E
40|$|During {{a series}} of network {{management}} retreats in June and July 1990, representatives from NASA Headquarters Codes O and S agreed on networking roles and responsibilities for their respective organizations. The representatives decided that NASA Science Internet (NSI) will assume management of both the Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN) and the NASA Science Network (NSN). SPAN {{is now known as}} the NSI/DECnet, and NSN is now known as the NSI/IP. Some management functions will be distributed between Ames Research Center (ARC) and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). NSI at ARC has the lead role for requirements generation and networking engineering. Advanced Applications and the Network Information Center is being developed at GSFC. GSFC will lead the NSI User Services, but NSI at Ames will continue to provide the User Services during the transition. The transition will be made as transparent as possible for the users. DECnet service will continue, but is now directly managed by NSI at Ames. NSI will continue to work closely with <b>routing</b> <b>center</b> managers at other NASA centers, and has formed a transition team to address the change in management. An NSI/DECnet working group had also been formed as a separate engineering group within NSI to plan the transition to Phase 5, DECnet's approach to Open System Integration (OSI). Transition is not expected {{for a year or more}} due to delays in produce releases. Plans to upgrade speeds in tail circuits and the backbone are underway. The proposed baseline service for new connections is up to 56 Kbps; 9. 6 Kbps lines will gradually be upgraded as requirements dictate. NSI is in the process of consolidating protocol traffic, tail circuits, and the backbone. Currently NSI's backbone is fractional T 1; NSI will go to full T 1 service as soon as it is feasible...|$|E

Inspired by recent {{interests}} in using shared trees for interdomain multicasting, we investigate the trade-offs among shared tree types and source specific shortest path trees, by comparing performance over both individual multicast group and the whole network. The performance is evaluated in terms of path length, link cost, and traffic concentration. We present simulation results over a real network as well as random networks under different circumstances. One practically significant conclusion is that member- or sendercentered trees have good delay and cost properties on average, but they exhibit heavier traffic concentration which makes them inappropriate as the universal form of trees {{for all types of}} applications.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{states that}} TCP {{performs}} poorly when packets arrive out of order. Reordered packets interact poorly with TCP’s fast retransmit mechanism.

Data <b>center</b> networks {{are very different from}} the Internet, having regular topologies, high-capacitylow-latency links, and switches with very small packet buffers.

In this paper, we survey techniques for making TCP more robust to packet reordering, in the hope of making per-packet load balancing a reality. ...|$|R

This drawing style is well suited for the visualisation of centrality in social networks and similar concepts. Radial drawings also allow a more flexible edge routing than horizontal drawings, as edges can be <b>routed</b> around the <b>center</b> in two directions. In experimental results this reduces the number of crossings by approx. 30 % on average. This paper is the last step to complete the framework for drawing hierarchical graphs in a radial fashion. We present three heuristics for crossing reduction in radial level {{drawings of}} hierarchical graphs, and also briefly cover extensions of the level assignment step {{to take advantage of}} the increasing perimeter of the circles. ...|$|R

Its upper level, originally an open hall, was used for town meetings and all manner of social gatherings until 1952, when it was subdivided into offices.|$|R
50|$|A {{vertical}} bandsaw, {{also called}} a contour saw, keeps the blade's path stationary while the workpiece is moved across it. This type of saw {{can be used}} to cut out complex shapes and angles. The part may be fed into the blade manually or with a power assist mechanism. This type of metal-cutting bandsaw is often equipped with a built-in blade welder. This not only allows the operator to repair broken blades or fabricate new blades quickly, but also allows for the blade to be purposely cut, <b>routed</b> through the <b>center</b> of a part, and re-welded in order to make interior cuts. These saws are often fitted with a built-in air blower to cool the blade and to blow chips away from the cut area giving the operator {{a clear view of the}} work. This type of saw is also built in a woodworking version. The woodworking type is generally of much lighter construction and does not incorporate a power feed mechanism, coolant, or welder.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} dynamic multi-skill <b>routing</b> in call <b>centers.</b> Calls from different customer classes are offered to the call center according to a Poisson process. The agents are grouped into pools according to their heterogeneous skill sets that determine the calls that they can handle. Each pool of agents serves calls with independent exponentially distributed service times. Arriving calls that cannot be served directly are placed in a buffer that {{is dedicated to the}} customer class. We obtain nearly optimal dynamic routing policies that are scalable with the problem instance and can be computed online. The algorithm is based on approximate dynamic programming techniques. In particular, we perform one-step policy improvement using a polynomial approximation to relative value functions. We compare the performance of this method with decomposition techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms leading routing policies and has close to optimal performance. © 2012 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
