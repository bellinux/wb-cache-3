The gate comprised an outer porch, an inner gatehall and a porter's lodge on the ground floor with chambers above the arch. It survived intact into the early 18th century but only the outer porch remains. The structure consists of a single large round-headed archway on the outer side with two smaller arches of different sizes, both deeply <b>rebated</b> to accommodate doors, a few metres to the south.

25|$|In general, elite Aksumite {{buildings}} such as palaces {{were constructed}} atop podia built of loose stones {{held together with}} mud-mortar, with carefully cut granite corner blocks which <b>rebated</b> back a few centimeters at regular intervals as the wall got higher, so the walls narrowed as they rose higher. These podia are often all that survive of Aksumite ruins. Above the podia, walls were generally build with alternating layers of loose stone (often whitewashed, like at Yemrehana Krestos Church) and horizontal wooden beams, with smaller round wooden beams set in the stonework often projecting out of the walls (these are called 'monkey heads') on the exterior and sometimes the interior. Both the podia and the walls above exhibited no long straight stretches, but were indented at regular intervals so that any long walls consisted {{of a series of}} recesses and salients. This helped to strengthen the walls. Worked granite was used for architectural features including columns, bases, capitals, doors, windows, paving, water spouts (often shaped like lion heads) and so on, as well as enormous flights of stairs that often flanked the walls of palace pavilions on several sides. Doors and windows were usually framed by stone or wooden cross-members, linked at the corners by square 'monkey heads', though simple lintels were also used. Many of these Aksumite features are seen carved into the famous stelae {{as well as in the}} later rock hewn churches of Tigray and Lalibela.|$|E

40|$|A channel <b>rebate</b> is {{a payment}} from a {{manufacturer}} to a retailer based on retailer sales to end consumers.

40|$|Abstract: Manufacturer <b>rebates</b> are {{commonly}} used as price discount tools for attracting end customers. In this study, we consider a two-stage supply chain with a manufacturer and a retailer, where a single seasonal product faces uncertain and price-sensitive demand.

Our results thus imply that “mail-in <b>rebates,</b> ” where some customers end up not claiming the <b>rebate,</b> particularly when the size of the <b>rebate</b> is relatively small, always benefit the manufacturer.

2500|$|While IMI makes a cosmetically similar pistol, {{originally}} {{called the}} Jericho 941 and marketed by Magnum Research as the [...] "Baby Eagle", the guns bear no functional equivalence: the Jericho/Baby Eagle design {{is a standard}} double action, short-recoil design derived from the CZ-75. The one functional similarity is in the IMI developed cartridges. The [...]41 Action Express (or [...]41 AE) developed for the Jericho 941 used a <b>rebated</b> rim, so that the pistol could switch between 9mm Luger and [...]41 AE with just the change of a barrel. This is because the [...]41 AE {{was based on a}} shortened [...]41 Magnum case with the rim and extractor groove cut to the same dimensions of the 9mm Luger. This allowed the same extractor and ejector to work with both cartridges. The [...]50 AE has a similar <b>rebated</b> rim, cut to the same dimensions as the [...]44 Magnum. This is what allows caliber changes between [...]44 Magnum and [...]50 AE with just the change of the barrel and magazine. Beginning January 1, 2009, KBI began importing the Jericho (using its original trade name). KBI Jericho pistols can be distinguished from earlier Jericho models by the addition of an accessory rail just forward the trigger guard. The Jericho 941's name was derived from the two cartridges it chambers, with the conversion kit.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]300 RUM {{features}} a <b>rebated</b> rim {{much like the}} [...]300 Canadian Magnum so as to allow the cartridge to function in the Remington M700 action without having to increase the bolt and bolt face diameter of the action. Unlike the belted Magnum cases based on the [...]375 H Magnum cartridge, the [...]300 RUM {{does not have a}} belt. All things being equal, a beltless cartridge would feed more reliably and more smoothly than a belted cartridge. Furthermore, as this is a beltless cartridge headspacing is designed to take place on the shoulder, which is considered beneficial by some as it is thought to promote accuracy and prolong case life of the cartridge. As modern belted magnums such as 7mm Remington Magnum and [...]300 Winchester Magnum actually headspace on the shoulder despite retaining the belt found on their parent cartridge, belted or unbelted is basically irrelevant in discussions of modern cartridges, and particularly so in discussions of unbelted cartridges.|$|E

40|$|Manufacturers have {{increasingly}} instituted widespread mail-in <b>rebate</b> programs in recent years. Two primary purposes for <b>rebates</b> are to: (1) more directly impact consumer demand by reducing net retail price, and (2) capitalize on consumers' slippage behavior {{because not all}} consumers who intend to redeem the <b>rebate</b> at purchase time end up actually redeeming it. However, retailers can counteract the power of <b>rebates</b> to impact demand by simply raising the retail price {{by the amount of}} the manufacturer's <b>rebate.</b> We show that by combining a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) along with a <b>rebate,</b> the manufacturer can better control the channel by inhibiting the retailer's ability to raise price, particularly when consumers exhibit loss aversion. As a result, incorporating MSRP with a <b>rebate</b> promotion plan increases the manufacturer's profit. More surprisingly, the profit of the supply chain as a whole also increases, and the channel efficiency increases as well. In fact, contrary to results from the existing <b>rebate</b> literature suggesting that <b>rebates</b> should always be offered whenever slippage exists, we demonstrate that MSRP can actually be a more effective tool than <b>rebates</b> in managing retailer and consumer behavior when consumers do not have sufficient loss aversion and the slippage rate is low enough.
