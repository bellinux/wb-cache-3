25|$|In the Earth's {{rotating}} {{frame of}} reference, a freely moving body follows an apparent path that deviates {{from the one}} it would follow in a fixed frame of reference. Because of the Coriolis effect, falling bodies veer slightly eastward from the vertical plumb line below their point of release, and projectiles veer right in the northern hemisphere (and left in the southern) from {{the direction in which}} they are shot. The Coriolis effect is mainly observable at a meteorological scale, where it is responsible for the differing <b>rotation</b> <b>direction</b> of cyclones in the northern and southern hemispheres.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} figure, the two {{orthogonal}} components {{have the same}} amplitudes and are 90° out of phase. In this case, one component is zero when the other component is at maximum or minimum amplitude. There are two possible phase relationships that satisfy this requirement: the x component can be 90° ahead of the y component {{or it can be}} 90° behind the y component. In this special case, the electric vector traces out a circle in the plane, so this polarization is called circular polarization. The <b>rotation</b> <b>direction</b> in the circle depends on which of the two phase relationships exists and corresponds to right-hand circular polarization and left-hand circular polarization.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} misconception, water {{rotation}} in home bathrooms {{under normal circumstances}} {{is not related to}} the Coriolis effect or to the rotation of the Earth, and no consistent difference in <b>rotation</b> <b>direction</b> between toilet drainage in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres can be observed. The formation of a vortex over the plug hole may be explained by the conservation of angular momentum: The radius of rotation decreases as water approaches the plug hole, so the rate of rotation increases, {{for the same reason that}} an ice skater's rate of spin increases as they pull their arms in. Any rotation around the plug hole that is initially present accelerates as water moves inward.|$|E

A microscopic picture of the non-reversality of optical interaction with zinc blende materials which breaks the kinetic coefficient symmetry is also presented...|$|R
25|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Uranus is calm {{compared to those}} of other giant planets. Only a limited number of small bright clouds at middle latitudes in both hemispheres and one Uranus Dark Spot have been observed since 1986. One of those bright cloud features, located at −34° of latitude and called Berg, probably existed continuously since at least 1986. Nevertheless, the Uranian atmosphere has rather strong zonal winds blowing in the retrograde (counter to the <b>rotation)</b> <b>direction</b> near the equator, but switching to the prograde direction poleward of ±20° latitude. The wind speeds are from −50 to −100m/s at the equator increasing up to 240m/s near 50° latitude. The wind profile measured before the equinox of 2007 was slightly asymmetric with winds stronger in the southern hemisphere, although {{it turned out to be}} a seasonal effect as this hemisphere was continuously illuminated by the Sun before 2007. After 2007 winds in the northern hemisphere accelerated while those in the southern one slowed down.|$|E
2500|$|The {{handedness}} of {{polarized light}} is also reversed {{when it is}} reflected off of a surface at normal incidence. Upon such reflection, {{the rotation of the}} plane of polarization of the reflected light is identical to that of the incident field. However, with propagation now in the opposite direction, the same <b>rotation</b> <b>direction</b> that would be described as [...] "right handed" [...] for the incident beam, is [...] "left-handed" [...] for propagation in the reverse direction, and vice versa. Aside from the reversal of handedness, the ellipticity of polarization is also preserved (except in cases of reflection by a birefringent surface).|$|E
2500|$|The Turbo-Hydramatic {{heavy-duty}} three-speed {{automatic transmission}} became available during {{development of the}} Toronado. Called the TH425 in FWD form, the transmission's torque converter was separated from its planetary gearset, with the torque converter driving the gearset through a [...] wide silent chain-drive called Hy-Vo, riding on two [...] sprockets. The Hy-Vo chain drive was developed by GM's Hydra-Matic Division and Morse Chain Division of Borg-Warner. The chains were made from a very strong hardened steel and required no tensioners or idler pulleys because they were pre-stretched on a special machine at the factory. Although the <b>rotation</b> <b>direction</b> of the transmission's gearing had to be reversed, {{a large number of}} components were shared with the conventional TH400. Use of the automatic also obviated the need to devise a workable manual-shift linkage; no manual transmission was ever contemplated, as engineers deemed performance to be adequate with the automatic transmission and because virtually all U.S.-built luxury cars during this period came with automatic transmissions as standard equipment. With this, the [...] time was clocked in 9.5seconds.|$|E
40|$|Conservation of angular {{momentum}} {{depends on the}} existence of rotational symmetry. However, even in systems where this symmetry is broken, flipping between {{angular momentum}} eigenstates often requires an activation energy. Here we discuss an example of superfluid flow in a toroidal potential, which shows sustained oscillations between two different <b>rotation</b> <b>directions.</b> The energy required to change the <b>direction</b> of <b>rotation</b> is taken out of and temporarily restored into the rotational and intra-component interaction energies of the system.

30|$|Experimental {{images with}} the {{constant}} velocity spiral {{are shown in}} Fig.  5 c. The outward and inward parts of the scan are displayed separately. Significant distortions are apparent {{at the center of}} the images where the scan frequency is changing the fastest. The two images have opposite <b>rotation</b> distortion <b>directions</b> in the center, which result from different spiral <b>rotation</b> <b>directions.</b> Therefore, the drawback of this spiral is that the angular frequency changes. Since the distortions depend on frequency, the disadvantage is that the distortions are non-uniform across a single frame. Another way to look at this problem is that to keep a constant linear velocity, the angular velocity has to be large near the center and smaller at the edges. Thus, the angular distortion changes with angular velocity, which results in much more severe distortions at the center.|$|R
50|$|The {{enlarged}} view below shows {{the left hand}} spikes to be slightly further apart than those on the right. This {{is an indication that}} the focus knob needs to be rotated slightly anti-clockwise. If the right hand spikes were further apart, a clockwise rotation would be needed. The mask should always be placed over the aperture with the same orientation. If the mask was rotated 180 degrees, then the focus knob directions would be reversed. The operator soon becomes familiar with the <b>rotation</b> <b>directions</b> needed for a given setup.|$|R

50|$|Single-engined {{propeller}} {{aircraft are}} inherently asymmetric, as the propeller <b>rotation</b> <b>direction</b> {{and the resultant}} propwash gives a strongly asymmetric effect over the tail control surfaces, especially at low speeds during takeoff. As engines became more powerful, {{around the end of}} World War II, the last single piston-engined fighters used contra-rotating propellers both to handle this great power, and also to reduce their asymmetry.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports a}} {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{study of the}} microstructure and texture below a conical nanoindent in a (111) Cu single crystal at nanometer-scale resolution. The experiments are conducted using a joint high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy/electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) set-up coupled with serial sectioning in a focused ion beam system {{in the form of}} a cross-beam 3 D crystal orientation microscope (3 D EBSD). The experiments (conducted in sets of subsequent (112 ¯) cross-section planes) reveal a pronounced deformation-induced 3 D patterning of the lattice rotations below the indent. In the cross-section planes perpendicular to the (111) surface plane below the indenter tip the observed deformation-induced rotation pattern is characterized by an outer tangent zone with large absolute values of the rotations and an inner zone closer to the indenter axis with small rotations. The mapping of the <b>rotation</b> <b>directions</b> reveals multiple transition regimes with steep orientation gradients and frequent changes in sign. The experiments are compared to 3 D elastic–viscoplastic crystal plasticity finite element simulations adopting the geometry and boundary conditions of the experiments. The simulations show a similar pattern for the absolute orientation changes but they fail to predict the fine details of the patterning of the <b>rotation</b> <b>directions</b> with the frequent changes in sign observed in the experiment. Also the simulations overemphasize the magnitude of the rotation field tangent to the indenter relative to that directly below the indenter tip...|$|R
30|$|Evidence {{including}} the <b>rotation</b> <b>directions,</b> the measured {{maximum principal stress}} magnitudes and the previous stress data is gathered to prove {{the authenticity of the}} two stress fields in the Late Mesozoic–Cenozoic models, and it is found that the calculated results are reliable. Despite slight differences between the calculated and observed maximum principal compressive stress, the modeling results of the Late Mesozoic stress fields indicate that the orientation of the maximum principal compressive stress in the Ordos Basin is WNW, whereas in the Cenozoic model, the orientation is NE. Based on the above-mentioned proofs, the validity of the two models in the Late Mesozoic and the Cenozoic can be corroborated.|$|R
5000|$|The Gibbs vector has the {{advantage}} (or disadvantage, depending on context) that 180° rotations cannot be represented in it. (Even using floating point numbers that include infinity, <b>rotation</b> <b>direction</b> cannot be well-defined; for example, naively, a 180° rotation about the axis (1, 1, 0) would be (∞, ∞, 0), {{which is the same}} representation as 180° rotation about (1, 0.0001, 0).) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{interactive}} system for reconstructing surface normals {{from a single}} image. Our approach has two complementary contributions. First, we introduce a novel shape-from-shading algorithm (SfS) that produces faithful normal reconstruction for local image region (high-frequency component), but it fails to faithfully recover the overall global structure (low-frequency component). Our second contribution consists of an approach that corrects low-frequency error using a simple markup procedure. This approach, aptly called rotation palette, allows the user to specify large scale corrections of surface normals by drawing simple stroke correspondences between the normal map and a sphere image which represents <b>rotation</b> <b>directions.</b> Combining these two approaches, we can produce high-quality surfaces quickly from single images...|$|R
50|$|Finlay, Dodwell, and Caelli (1984) and Finlay and Dodwell (1987) studied {{perception}} of rotating wheels under stroboscopic illumination when {{the duration of}} each frame was long enough for observers to see the real rotation.
