5|$|On 9 December 2014 it was {{reported}} that the Science Museum, London had acquired a large collection of Patrick Moore's objects and manuscripts and memorabilia, including The Sky at Night scripts, and about 70 of his observation books, over more than 60 years, and manuscripts for astronomy and fiction books, and a 12.5 inch <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope.</b>|$|E
5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope,</b> today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge {{the quality of the}} optics for his telescopes. In late 1668 he was able to produce this first <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope.</b> It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope.</b> Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.|$|E
5|$|Kepler was {{the first}} to devise a system that {{described}} correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the Sun at the center. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was left to Newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation to finally explain the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Reflecting</b> <b>telescopes,</b> {{just like}} any other optical system, do not produce [...] "perfect" [...] images. The need to image objects at {{distances}} up to infinity, view them at different wavelengths of light, along with the requirement to have some way to view the image the primary mirror produces, means there is always some compromise in a <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope's</b> optical design.|$|R

5|$|The OSO and OAO {{missions}} {{demonstrated the}} important role space-based observations could play in astronomy, and in 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-based <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope</b> with a mirror 3m in diameter, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. These plans emphasized the need for manned maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the reusable space shuttle indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available.|$|E
25|$|In 1666, Isaac Newton {{argued that}} the faults of the refracting {{telescope}} were fundamental because the lens refracted light of different colors differently. He concluded that light could not be refracted through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could {{be made in the}} refracting telescope. However, he was able to demonstrate that the angle of reflection remained the same for all colors, so he decided to build a <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope.</b> It was completed in 1668 and is the earliest known functional <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{speculum}} metal mirror secondaries or diagonal mirrors {{greatly reduced}} {{the light that}} reached the eyepiece, several <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope</b> designers tried {{to do away with}} them. In 1762 Mikhail Lomonosov presented a <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope</b> before the Russian Academy of Sciences forum. It had its primary mirror tilted at four degrees to telescope's axis so the image could be viewed via an eyepiece mounted {{at the front of the}} telescope tube without the observer's head blocking the incoming light. This innovation was not published until 1827, so this type came to be called the Herschelian telescope after a similar design by William Herschel.|$|E

25|$|William Herschel, {{previously}} a clarinet player, of Bath discovered {{infrared radiation}} on 11 February 1800, {{and the planet}} Uranus in March 1781; he had made important improvements to the <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope</b> by increasing the mirror diameter. Herschel then built a 20-ft <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope</b> and invented the star count, working out that the Milky Way was a disc, which he called a grindstone, and the Milky Way was a galaxy but that {{that was all the}} universe contained; he had noticed other nebulas but did not recognise what these were; only when the Hooker telescope was built sufficiently large-enough in California in 1924, did Edwin Hubble realise that these nebulas (Andromeda Galaxy) were other galaxies. The Herschel Space Observatory was launched by ESA in March 2009 to map the Milky Way. Sir Arthur C. Clarke of Minehead invented the idea of artificial satellites; he sent a letter to Harry Wexler who then developed the first weather satellite TIROS-1. Sir Arthur Eddington of Weston-super-Mare was the first to realise that nuclear fusion powered the Sun; previously the age of Sun was thought to be only 20 million years old, which he knew had to be older than that; at the 1920 British Association meeting he said that the Sun converted hydrogen into helium, but he did not know how, and that mass was lost; nuclear fission was only considered in 1933. James Bradley was an important astronomer from Gloucestershire, who discovered the aberration of light.|$|E
25|$|Since {{crafting}} large lenses is {{much more}} difficult than crafting large mirrors, most modern <b>telescopes</b> are <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescopes,</b> that is, telescopes that use a primary mirror rather than an objective lens. The same general optical considerations apply to <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescopes</b> that applied to refracting telescopes, namely, the larger the primary mirror, the more light collected, and the magnification is still equal to the focal length of the primary mirror divided by the focal length of the eyepiece. Professional telescopes generally do not have eyepieces and instead place an instrument (often a charge-coupled device) at the focal point instead.|$|R

25|$|The initial Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS or POSS-I), {{sponsored}} by the National Geographic institute, was completed in 1958. The first plates were shot in November 1948 and the last in April 1958. This survey was performed using 14inch2 (6 degree2) or blue-sensitive (Kodak 103a-O) and red-sensitive (Kodak 103a-E) photographic plates on the 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope.</b> The survey covered the sky from a declination of +90 degrees (celestial north pole) to -27 degrees and all right ascensions and had a sensitivity to +22 magnitudes (about 1 million times fainter than the limit of human vision). A southern extension extending the sky coverage of the POSS to -33 degrees declination was shot in 1957 - 1958. The final POSS I consisted of 937 plate pairs.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Newton (1643–1727) {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into {{a spectrum of}} colours, and that a lens and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that {{regardless of whether it}} was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours, and invented a <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope</b> (today known as a Newtonian telescope) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his <b>reflecting</b> <b>telescope.</b> Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour, which he later expanded into his Opticks. Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light (Opticks Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons and the idea of wave-particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.|$|E
25|$|Williams College is {{the site}} of the Hopkins Observatory, the oldest extant astronomical {{observatory}} in the United States.
