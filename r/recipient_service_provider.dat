40|$|In {{the debate}} in global mental health about the most {{effective}} models for developing and scaling interventions, there have been calls {{for the development of}} a more robust literature regarding the "non-specific", science of delivery aspects of interventions that are locally, contextually, and culturally relevant. This study describes a rigorous, exploratory, qualitative examination of the key, non-specific intervention strategies of a diverse group of five internationally-recognized organizations addressing mental illness in middle income countries (MICs). A triangulated approach to inquiry was used with semi-structured interviews conducted with <b>service</b> <b>recipients,</b> <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> and leaders, and key community partners (N = 159). The interview focus was upon processes of implementation and operation. A grounded theory-informed analysis revealed cross cutting themes of: a holistic conceptualization of mental health problems, an intensive application of principles of leverage and creating the social, cultural, and policy "space" within which interventions could be applied and resourced. These findings aligned with key aspects of systems dynamic theory suggesting that it might be a helpful framework in future studies of mental health service implementation in MICs...|$|R

It {{includes}} a thorough legal analysis of this multifaceted issue of high {{the economic and social}} impact and derives to guide the reader to deal with outsourcing. The purpose is to help in understanding the key legal factors involved in an outsourcing process, both for organizations considering IT outsourcing and for organizations that provide IT outsourcing. This thesis covers what is generally applicable to all types of outsourcing, while it also focuses on what is specifically relevant for IT. Each chapter centers on a different aspect of IT outsourcing contracts. IT outsourcing occurs when a <b>service</b> <b>recipient</b> externalizes, in whole or in part, an internal business function, activity or service to a <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> that manages and delivers to an agreed quality level during a period of time. It may include the transfer of the <b>service</b> <b>recipient’s</b> staff and/or assets -mainly hardware and software- previously used to execute the outsourced function to the <b>service</b> <b>provider.</b> In such a case, the outsourcing contract must define the legal issues involved in transferring the assets associated with the services from the <b>service</b> <b>recipient</b> to the <b>service</b> <b>provider’s</b> control [...] ...|$|R

Many of the existing studies about bodywork have however, centred primarily on paid workers in nursing or social care. This focus means that little is known about unpaid family carers’ experiences of bodywork and the associated emotional labour arising from the challenges of caring for older people. This paper draws on a longitudinal, qualitative study which used a grounded theory methodology. Over a period of 28 months, it explored the experiences of carers of older people who were unsupported by formal services and who initially had no help with personal and intimate care. Findings reveal that caregivers are confronted daily with the changing realities of bodywork as they deal with a deteriorating body, increasing levels of dependency and the changing nature of relationships with the care <b>recipient</b> and <b>service</b> <b>providers.</b> The paper argues that younger carers in particular, find bodywork one of the most distressing and challenging parts of their role and that <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> should not assume that carers can manage this aspect of their role with equanimity. ...|$|R

As a response to external change banks have created new synergies in the pursuit of greater growth and interviewees expected that changes in synergy creation should be reflected in banks' diversification and market positioning moves. New synergies required new capabilities and participants from all countries agreed that the current wave of change in synergy creation had carried through greater emphasis on customer profitability. All countries recorded a shift from a supply-oriented strategic stance to the development of skills to retain customers and even becoming a one-stop financial service institution for their customers. However, greater emphasis on customer profitability was seldom followed by recognition of the key capabilities required for high customer value creation.

40|$|The {{intimate}} and personal care provided {{for older people}} by informal carers has been recognised {{as a form of}} bodywork (Twigg 2000, 2006). While bodywork may not be undertaken by all informal carers, it is central to those who are at the ‘heavy end’ of caring. Yet many of the existing studies about bodywork have centred primarily on paid carers working in the health and social care sectors (Shakespeare 2003, Twigg 2006). Furthermore, in terms of social work literature and theory, the body is invisible, unproblematised and under-theorised. Bodies are implicit and taken-for-granted while other phenomena, such as emotion, sensation and cognition tend to be overlooked (Cameron and McDermott 2007). These omissions mean that little is known about unpaid carers’ experiences of bodywork and the associated emotions and sensations arising from the challenges of caregiving. This paper highlights the problematic and invisible nature of bodywork. It draws on a longitudinal qualitative study which used a grounded theory methodology to explore the experiences of unsupported carers of older people who initially had no help to provide personal and intimate care. Findings reveal that as caregivers deal with deteriorating and ageing bodies, they are confronted daily with the unpleasant realities of bodywork, with increasing levels of dependency and the changing nature of relationships with care <b>recipients</b> and <b>service</b> <b>providers.</b> The paper argues that younger carers in particular, find bodywork one of the most distressing and challenging parts of their role; that <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> {{need to be aware of}} this issue.

Increasingly, conceptions of role are seen not as static and absolute, but as related to the differing (and subjective) viewpoints of the various participants involved. This study uses semi-structured interviews, conducted immediately after five interpreter-mediated encounters (four medical, one legal), to examine: (1) how participants in each encounter differ in their comments on the interpreter, and (2) whether the resulting perspective on the interpreter’s role is related to each respondent’s specific conversational goal on the occasion in question. Twenty six excerpts from the interviews are discussed: all three participants (<b>service</b> <b>provider,</b> <b>service</b> user, interpreter) were interviewed in three cases, while the interpreter was unavailable for interview in one case and the <b>service</b> <b>recipient</b> in another.
