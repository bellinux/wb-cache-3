40|$|Abstract Background Understanding {{demographic}} histories, such as divergence time, {{patterns of}} gene flow, and population size changes, in ecologically diverging lineages provide {{implications for the}} process and maintenance of population differentiation by ecological adaptation. This study addressed the demographic histories in two independently derived lineages of flood-resistant riparian plants and their non-riparian relatives [Ainsliaea linearis (riparian) and A. apiculata (non-riparian); A. oblonga (riparian) and A. macroclinidioides (non-riparian); Asteraceae] using an isolation-with-migration (IM) model based on variation at 10 nuclear DNA loci. Results The highest posterior probabilities of the divergence time parameters were estimated to be ca. 25, 000 years ago for A. linearis and A. apiculata and ca. 9000 years ago for A. oblonga and A. macroclinidioides, although the confidence intervals of the parameters had broad ranges. The likelihood ratio tests detected evidence of historical gene flow between both riparian/non-riparian species pairs. The <b>riparian</b> <b>populations</b> showed lower levels of genetic diversity and {{a significant reduction in}} effective population sizes compared to the non-riparian populations and their ancestral populations. Conclusions This study showed the recent origins of flood-resistant riparian plants, which are remarkable examples of plant ecological adaptation. The recent divergence and genetic signatures of historical gene flow among riparian/non-riparian species implied that they underwent morphological and ecological differentiation within short evolutionary timescales and have maintained their species boundaries in the face of gene flow. Comparative analyses of adaptive divergence in two sets of riparian/non-riparian lineages suggested that strong natural selection by flooding had frequently reduced the genetic diversity and size of <b>riparian</b> <b>populations</b> through genetic drift, possibly leading to fixation of adaptive traits in <b>riparian</b> <b>populations.</b> The two sets of riparian/non-riparian lineages showed contrasting patterns of gene flow and genetic differentiation, implying that each lineage showed different degrees of reproductive isolation and that they had experienced unique evolutionary and demographic histories in the process of adaptive divergence. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Species {{movement}} {{responses to}} landscape structures {{have been studied}} {{using a variety of}} methods, but movement research is still in need of simple methods that help predicting and comparing movements across structurally different landscapes. We demonstrate how habitat-specific movement models can be used to disentangle causes of differentiated movement patterns in structurally different landscapes and to predict movement patterns in altered and artificial landscapes. In our case study, we studied the role of riparian landscapes to the persistence of the endangered false heath fritillary butterfly (Melitaea diamina) in its newly discovered coastal distribution region in Finland. We compared the movement parameters of the <b>riparian</b> <b>population</b> to two reference populations by using capture-recapture data and habitat-specific diffusion modelling, and analysed the role of the river and riverbank buffer zones in facilitating or hindering false heath fritillary movement with movement simulations. Results The <b>riparian</b> <b>population</b> of the false heath fritillary did not show major differences to reference populations in terms of movement parameters within breeding habitat, high-quality matrix and low-quality matrix. However, movement simulations showed that the habitat-specific movement parameters estimated for the false heath fritillary can lead into markedly different movement patterns in structurally different landscapes. An artificial riparian landscape mimicking those of the coastal distribution resulted into more directional, longitudinal movements both parallel and perpendicular to the river than a more mosaic-like landscape, but the existence of the river in the landscape reduced movements across the river. Conclusions Our study demonstrates how habitat-specific movement models enable comparisons of movement patterns across structurally different real, altered and artificial landscapes. As such, they can be used to compare movement parameters across populations, to study the effects of management interventions to endangered species and to identify areas that have high sensitivity to individual movement. In our case study, the river is shown to perform a dual role for the movements of the riparian false heath fritillary population. Whereas the river acts as a moderate movement barrier for the false heath fritillary, the longitudinal configuration of riverbank habitats provides a means especially for the male false heath fritillaries to move across the landscape...|$|E

The monoecious African fig tree Ficus sycomorus L. relies on the small, short-lived, night-flying, host-specific fig wasp Ceratosolen arabicus Mayr for pollination. We used microsatellite markers to characterize a geographically isolated <b>riparian</b> <b>population</b> of F. sycomorus growing along the Ugab River in the Namib Desert, Namibia, together with paternity analysis of seedlings from known mothers, to map pollen movement within this population. In this way we tracked insect movements between individually recognizable trees by means of their pollen cargo and documented the movement of C. arabicus between known trees separated by more than 160 km, with a mean distance for confirmed successful pollination events of 88. 6 km. The predominant observed movement of pollinators was in a westerly direction, toward the sea, reflecting seasonal nighttime wind direction and the wind-borne dispersal of fig wasps.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the implications of the fish export trade on the fishers and the fisheries resources of Lake Victoria, Uganda with respect to sustainability. Eight fish processing factories and ninety fishers were qualitatively investigated. Socio-economic characteristics of fishers and the economic characteristics of fish factories formed a basis for the analysis. Results of the research indicate that there is a relationship between the growth in fish export trade, particularly the growth in industrial fish processing (for export) and declining fisheries resources of the lake. However, whether or not that impact is positive or negative, and to what extent there is an impact, is highly dependent upon the underlying socio-economic considerations of the fishers to the process. The fish-ban imposed by the European Union countries was particularly decried by fishers and factory owners as the main cause for the present poverty among the fishers. Fundamentally, several conflicting issues: ecological, physical and economic activities are a threat to the sustainability of the Lake Victoria fisheries, and for all that depend on and interact with the lake. There is urgent need to address the immediate issue of the growing <b>riparian</b> <b>population</b> and the global fish trade, to educate and train all the relevant actors in appropriate fisheries management techniques. Attitudes of fishers towards the fish factory developments are positive and this is a way forward for co-management for the sustainability of the fisheries resource...|$|E

This study focuses on stream water quality along a Mekong basin tributary, the Houay Xon that flows within a mountainous, mosaic land-use catchment of northern Lao P. D. R. To compare direct water quality measurements to the perception of water quality within the <b>riparian</b> <b>population,</b> our survey included interviews of villagers. Water quality was found to vary greatly depending on the location along the stream. Overall, it reflected the balance between the stream self-cleaning potential and human pressure on the riparian zone: (i) high bacteria and suspended load levels occurred where livestock are left to free-range within the riparian zone; (ii) very low oxygen content and high bacteriological contamination prevailed downstream from villages; (iii) high concentrations of bacteria were consistently observed along urbanized banks; (iv) low oxygen content were associated with the discharge of organic-rich wastewater from a small industrial plant; (v) very high suspended load and bacteria levels occurred during flood events due to soil erosion from steep cultivated hill slopes. Besides these human induced pollutions we also noted spontaneous enrichments in metals in wetland areas fed by dysoxic groundwater. These biophysical measurements were in agreement with the opinions expressed by the majority of the interviewees who reported poor and decreasing water quality in the Houay Xon catchment.

The mode of infection is probably transepithelial penetration. The large number of rivers and lakes and the strong presence of <b>riparian</b> <b>populations</b> in the State of Maranh√£o are strong predisposing factors for rhinosporidiosis. METHODS: A 5 -year retrospective {{study was conducted in}} a tertiary medical center situated in Maranh√£o, Northeast Brazil.

40|$|In Lake Kivu, gases accumulate, {{exposing the}} <b>riparian</b> <b>population</b> to {{the perils of}} a limnic eruption. This primary {{challenge}} {{has been known for}} years. Measurements have now established that the chemoclines in Lake Kivu are moving upward at the following total vertical flow rates (in km 3 y- 1) : ~ 0. 05 below 390 m, ~ 0. 12 below 313 m, ~ 0. 13 below 257 m, ~ 0. 25 below 191 m, and ~ 1. 39 below ~ 140 m depth. The upward movement is caused by inflows to the deeper parts of the lake from water sources with different salinities and thus of different densities. As a result, they stratify at their different isopycnal levels (especially at 350 m and at 220 to 245 m depth) and mix into the waters at those levels, thus pushing up all water above, chemoclines and mixed zones alike. Water from rivers in the catchment area remains in the mixolimnion and when cold, some may sink down to the uppermost mixolimnion. Depending on the wind direction, it is suggested that alternating outflows from Kabuno Bay with variable density ends up either in the mixolimnion or at 245 m depth. In Lake Kivu, only the uppermost chemocline remains at the same level; in this case the upward movement results in transport of mass across the chemocline. In the uppermost mixed zone of the monimolimnion, from 130 to 180 m depth, the natural dilution might suffice to outbalance methane accumulation and thus to prevent any future limnic eruption from this zone. In the next mixed zone below (at 200 to 250 m depth), the upward displacement of dissolved gases to higher levels increases the risk of future limnic eruption. In fact, over time this risk is changed to certainty, even if gas is removed from the deeper (commercially attractive) layers. The limited dilution in this zone probably does not suffice to outbalance methane accumulation. Furthermore, if this upward movement is not prevented, probably within a decade or two a point of no return is likely to be passed, leaving us with no reliable means of responding to this challenge. It is therefore necessary to stop the upward movement by disposing ~ 0. 25 km 3 y- 1 of degassed water into the mixolimnion. It is what gas extraction plants do to the lake in the next decades that determines whether realistically a future limnic eruption from this layer may be prevented...|$|E
40|$|The Wouri River, {{situated}} in the Wouri Basin, {{is one of the}} main rivers of the Littoral Region in the city of Douala in Cameroon. It is a source of income and food for the population living around these areas. Since the 1990 s, the fishing, transportation, irrigation and sand extraction activities have been impeded by the invasion of aquatic plants, specifically water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes [Mart. ] Solms-Laubach: Pontederiaceae). Introduced in 1997 to the shore of Lake Chad, water hyacinth has invaded almost 114 ha of the Wouri Basin. Furthermore, Douala, the economic capital of the Cameroon and location for more than 70 % of the country‚Äôs industries, uses the Wouri River and its tributaries to deposit its effluent and waste, which has worsened the problem of water hyacinth. This thesis examined the ecological and socio-economic impacts of water hyacinth in the Wouri Basin and its possible control. An increase in the nutrients in the water has provided water hyacinth with appropriate conditions for its fast growth during both the rainy and dry seasons. The availability of nutrients in these areas is enhanced by the constant, daily tidal fluctuation of water, providing enough water to the plant for easy nutrient uptake. A survey of the impacts of water hyacinth on aquatic plant communities in the Wouri Basin showed that this plant is able to out-compete native species. Assessment of the impact of water hyacinth on the abundance and diversity of plant communities indicated that at some invaded sites, 65 % of the vegetation consisted of water hyacinth. Species found in association with water hyacinth with a high level of abundance-dominance were Pistia stratiotes L. (Araceae) (another invader), Commelina benghalensis L. (Commelinaceae) and Echinochloa pyramidalis (Lam.) Hitchc. & Chase (Poaceae). This component of the study also showed that habitats rich in water hyacinth were poor in diversity, while habitats without water hyacinth were rich in diversity, thus raising awareness of the importance of monitoring invasive aquatic weeds along the Wouri Basin, and of implementing correct control management of all invasive aquatic weeds. Communities living along the invaded rivers are well aware of the range of problems caused by the weed; because as the rivers and water bodies used for fishing, transportation, and sand extraction are progressively invaded by the weed, the <b>riparian</b> <b>population</b> is the first to feel the impact. The impact on people has been noticeable, with an increase in diseases, such as malaria, cholera, diarrhoea, typhoid, filariasis, schistosomiasis, scabies and yellow fever increasing the need for a medicine and hospitalization. Economic losses due to the management of invasive aquatic weeds were recorded, and the Ministry of Environment spent an estimated US$ 1 200 000 between 2010 and 2015 to manage this scourge. In 2016, an amount of US$ 160 000 was transferred to these regions to manage invasive aquatic weeds, especially water hyacinth, although manual clearing is still the only method used to control this weed. Isolation of fungi from diseased water hyacinth plants in the Wouri Basin revealed several fungal species, most of which have been isolated from water hyacinth species in water bodies elsewhere, which showed a higher diversity during the dry season than during the rainy season. These fungi included Acremonium zonatum (Sawada). W. Gams (Hypocreaceae), Alternaria eichhorniae Nag Raj & Ponnappa (Pleosporaceae), Chaetomium sp., Colletotrichum sp., Curvularia pallescens Boedjin (Pleosporaceae), Curvalaria sp., Epicoccum nigrum Link (Pleosporaceae), Fusarium sp., Pithomyces chartarum fBerk. & M. A. Curtis) M. B. Ellis (Montagnulaceae), to a lesser extent Myrothecium roridum Tode ex Fr. (Incertae sedis) and Nigrospora sp. Although never released in Cameroon, arthropod biological control agents (Neochetina eichhorniae Warner (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) and N. bruchi Hustache (Coleoptera, Curculionidae)) were present, but their populations were relatively low. The slow spread of the insect population was explained by several factors, among them the tidal fluctuation of water, which has an impact on the population growth of the weevils. Whilst adults may be able to survive tidal fluctuations, larvae are severely impacted by them, contributing to the slow success of biological control. In this study, a significant increase in pathogen-induced disease severity and incidence was noted when Neochetina eichhorniae weevils were present, possibly because larvae tunnelling on the petiole created openings for the penetration of fungal spores. This study highlights the negative impacts of water hyacinth, on the environment, people, and thus economy of Cameroon. The presence of biological control agents and pathogens offers Cameroon the possibility of initiating and properly implementing the biological control option, or an integrated management solution, to manage water hyacinth in the Wouri Basin, and in the rest of Cameroon...|$|E

Crows and ravens spread along with agriculture and urbanization into the western part of North America.|$|R

However, different factors may control population dynamics in different microhabitats. This study recognizes that microhabitat variation may attenuate the influence of climatic seasonality on the population dynamics of herbaceous species in dry forest (Caatinga) areas of Brazil. We evaluated the influence of three microhabitats (flat, rocky and <b>riparian)</b> on the <b>population</b> dynamics of four herbaceous species (Delilia biflora, Commelina obliqua, Phaseolus peduncularis and Euphorbia heterophylla) in a Caatinga (dry forest) fragment at the Experimental Station of the Agronomic Research Institute of Pernambuco in Brazil, over a period of three years. D. biflora, C. obliqua and P. peduncularis were found in all microhabitats, but they were present at low densities in the riparian microhabitat. There was no record of E. heterophylla in the <b>riparian</b> microhabitat. <b>Population</b> size, mortality rates and natality rates varied over time in each microhabitat. This study indicates that different establishment conditions influenced the population size and occurrence of the four species, and it confirms that microhabitat can attenuate the effect of drought stress on mortality during the dry season, but the strength of this attenuator role may vary with time and species...|$|R
40|$|The Aral Sea, which before 1960 was {{the fourth}} largest lake in the world, has now split into four {{separate}} water bodies. This break-up and desiccation mainly resulted from upstream irrigation withdrawals from the two main influent rivers, the Syr Darya and and Amu Darya. The negative effects on the lake ecosystem due to declining water level and increasing salinity, {{as well as the}} profound socioeconomic and human impacts to the <b>riparian</b> <b>populations,</b> have been well documented. This paper focuses on the conservation and rehabilitation efforts for four remaining key water bodies of the Aral Sea: the Northern (Small) Aral and its ecosystem: the Southern (Large) Aral and its ecosystem; the delta and delatic water bodies of the Syr Darya; and the delta and deltaic water bodies of the Amu Darya. It is encouraging to note the reversal of the degradation in the Northern Aral after the creation of a dike at Berg 2 ÃÜ 7 s Strait in 1992. The dike washed out in 1999 but has been replaced with a new structurally sound dike. The water level in the Northern Aral has increased several meters and salinity is returning to levels that can sustain the pre- 1960 ecosystem. However, much less success has been obtained regarding the Southern Aral which continues its retreat and salinization. There have been recent efforts also in the deltas and deltaic regions of the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya, the rehabilitation of Sudochie Lake probably being the most famous. These restoration projects are critiqued in this paper and recommendations for future actions are given...|$|R
5|$|Bivalves {{have long}} {{been a part of}} the diet of coastal and <b>riparian</b> human <b>populations.</b> Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and {{mariculture}} has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques. A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research study is to assess the capability of time-series of MODIS imagery to provide information suitable for enhancing {{the understanding of the}} temporal cycles shown by the abnormal growth of the floating macrophytes in order to support monitoring and management action of Lake Victoria water resources. The proliferation of invasive plants and aquatic weeds is of growing concern. Starting from 1989, Lake Victoria has been interested by the high infestation of water hyacinth with significant socio-economic impact on <b>riparian</b> <b>populations.</b> In this paper, we describe an approach based on the time-series of MODIS to derive the temporal behaviour, the abundance and distribution of the floating macrophytes in the Winam Gulf (Kenyan portion of the Lake Victoria) and its possible links to the concentrations of the main water constituencies. To this end, we consider the NDVI values computed from the MODIS imagery time-series from 2000 to 2009 to identify the floating macrophytes cover and an appropriate bio-optical model to retrieve, by means of an inverse procedure, the concentrations of chlorophyll a, coloured dissolved organic matter and total suspended solid. The maps of the floating vegetation based on the NDVI values allow us to assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of the weeds with high time resolution. A floating vegetation index (FVI) has been introduced for describing the weeds pollution level. The results of the analysis show a consistent temporal relation between the water constituent concentrations within the Winam Gulf and the FVI, especially in the proximity of the greatest proliferation of floating vegetation in the last 10 years that occurred between the second half of 2006 and the first half of 2007. The adopted approach will be useful to implement an automatic system for monitoring and predicting the floating macrophytes proliferation in Lake Victoria...|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} and genetic structure of populations, and the processes shaping gene flow {{within and between}} populations, {{are influenced by the}} landscapes they occur within. Within terrestrial landscapes, rivers and their riparian habitat are among the most dynamic, diverse and complex of landscapes and their linear structure appears as an interlinking feature across large landscapes. This thesis took a landscape genetics approach to examine the influence of river landscape features on Alnus glutinosa populations, a widespread keystone tree species of European riparian ecosystems. By accounting for the differing dispersal mechanisms of A. glutinosa (wind and water), landscape effects on seed- and pollen-mediated gene flow, {{genetic diversity}}, demographic and genetic structure were identified at different spatial scales of a large UK river catchment. Widespread gene flow within and between A. glutinosa populations was identified with no apparent limitation of wind-mediated pollen dispersal. Hydrochorous dispersal of seed between populations was evident, and found to increase genetic connectivity between riparian populations; however an isolation by distance effect was identified between populations located further apart from each other. No pattern of genetic diversity was found, with high levels of genetic diversity identified at all spatial and temporal scales. At the river-catchment scale no genetic clustering was observed, either within or between the six rivers studied. Demographic structuring within A. glutinosa populations was evident, and correlated with distance from the main river channel. Interactions between seed dispersal, hydrological disturbance, colonisation, and historical influences are discussed in relation to fine-scale spatial genetic structure between A. glutinosa sapling and adult generations. Central to the landscape genetics approach taken in this thesis was the incorporation of key A. glutinosa life history attributes. By incorporating gene flow analyses, species ecology and landscape features, the research presented here furthers our understanding of riverine landscape influences on their <b>riparian</b> <b>populations</b> at different spatial scales and can be used to inform management principles...|$|R
500|$|By the 1970s and 1980s, {{a century}} of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the {{riparian}} vegetation along stream banks in the Trout Creek Mountains {{and elsewhere in the}} Great Basin. [...] As a result, stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into <b>riparian</b> zones. Aspen <b>populations</b> declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees, decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures. These conditions put the rare Lahontan cutthroat trout population at risk. [...] Since the Lahontan was officially designated as a threatened species, environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the Trout Creek Mountains.|$|R
40|$|Two rural stream sites {{intended}} for enhancement were evaluated pre-construction to collect baseline data on <b>riparian</b> bird <b>populations</b> and vegetative characteristics. The fixed-radius point count method {{was used to}} survey the winter avian community, and vegetative attributes (DBH, percent tree canopy cover, volume of downed woody debris) were collected {{within each of the}} radius plots. Using a multinomial regression, the probability of detecting each bird species was calculated for each survey plot and subsequently related to the characteristics of the vegetation to create a model that describes the winter bird-habitat relationship. The model predicted that major vegetative disturbances would be highly detrimental to the diversity of the winter bird community, and demonstrated that mature bottomland hardwood forests are ideal for the numerous habitat preferences of different wintering birds. These data provide the basis for multiple suggestions for stream restoration practices on sites where the riparian buffer is already composed of mature bottomland hardwood forests, the most important of which is conserving and improving the established vegetation by considering stream mitigatio...|$|R

50|$|St. Francis' satyrs {{are found}} in wetland habitat {{dominated}} by graminoids and sedges. Most subpopulations {{are found in}} abandoned beaver dams or along streams with active beavers. Suitable habitat is highly susceptible to variation in rainfall and subpopulations can be reduced with {{too much or too}} little water flow. St. Francis' satyrs cannot survive in sites that are either inundated by flooding or that succeed to <b>riparian</b> forest, thus <b>population</b> persistence often depends on disturbance by beaver and periodic fire that eliminates encroaching woody shrubs and trees. Past management practices of beaver eradication and fire suppression have likely contributed to current low population abundances and restricted distribution.|$|R
40|$|Our main {{objective}} is to describe the spatial behavior of several microclimatic conditions and how they affect {{the structure of a}} <b>riparian</b> plant <b>population.</b> <b>Riparian</b> zones provide space for high biological diversity compared with adjacent upland forest because of their special microclimatic conditions. The study site is in an old-growth temperate forest in the Cuenca del Suspiro, Bertiz Natural Park of the north of Navarra (Spain). Our first objective it to explain spatio-temporal soil moisture gradient generated from the stream edges, and explain how it affect to the presence of a riparian species. Our second {{objective is to}} understand the dependence on abiotic factors and the biotic process of the development of Carex remota L. population. Soil moisture showed a sigmoid trend and allowed us to define the limits of a wet riparian zone at 1. 25 m of distance from and 0. 55 m in elevation above stream banks. Elevation above stream banks is more influential than distance in defining the limits of the riparian zone. Riparian zone values of soil moisture are high and constant even {{at the end of a}} dry period due to the continuous water flow. These high and constant soil moisture values allow the establishment and development of a riparian plant species. With the approach of point processes we were able to simulate separately and jointly the effect of a homogeneous or heterogeneous habitat and the absence or presence of some biotic processes, as seed dispersal and/or density-dependent interactions. The result of the bivariate function analysis suggested a weak positive relation between adults and seedlings that survived the first summer. Models from three censuses showed a decreasing degree of clustering from seedlings to adults. The new Matern Cluster process allowed the quantification of the different sources of variation driving the spatial distribution of Carex remota population studied. Besides, the results showed that the importance of the main factors that explain the population structure changes along the development of Carex stages. Compared to seedlings, the adults pattern showed an increasing dependence of abiotic factors...|$|R
