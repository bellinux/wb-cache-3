50|$|Amberjack is an Atlantic and Pacific fish of the Carangidae family (genus Seriola). They are a game fish, {{most often}} found in the warmer parts of ocean. There are many types of amberjacks, {{including}} greater amberjacks (Atlantic), lesser amberjacks (Atlantic), Almaco jack (Pacific), yellowtail (Pacific), and the banded <b>rudderfish</b> (Atlantic).|$|E
5000|$|The {{black ruff}} (Centrolophus niger) is a medusafish, {{the only member}} of the genus Centrolophus. It is a mesopelagic fish found in all {{tropical}} and temperate oceans at depths of 50 to 1,000 m. Its length is typically up to 60 cm, but it may reach 150 cm. Other common names include <b>rudderfish</b> and blackfish.|$|E
50|$|Girella nigricans, {{commonly}} known as the opaleye or <b>rudderfish,</b> is a species of sea chub found in the Eastern Pacific, from California to southern Baja California. A rarely documented isolated population also exists in the Gulf of California, which might be genetically {{different from the rest of}} the species. They are commonly found in shallow waters and intertidal zones, usually over rocks and kelp beds, at depths of 1 to 32 m. They feed primarily on algae, but will occasionally consume sessile invertebrates (including crustaceans, worms, and molluscs). They are considered commercially important game fish.|$|E
50|$|Banded <b>rudderfish,</b> Seriola zonata, is the second-smallest amberjack. This jack can be {{distinguished}} from the pilot fish {{by the presence of}} a first dorsal fin. Juveniles are banded vertically like pilotfish, and follow large objects or animals. Large individuals (over 10 inches) have no bands. This fish, though commonly caught, is rarely identified. Large ones, with a raccoon-stripe on the eye and an iridescent gold stripe on the side, are usually called amberjacks when caught, and juveniles are called pilotfish. They are found as far north as Nova Scotia. They are less dependent on sharks, etc., than pilotfish. They can be caught on shrimp, silversides, lures (e.g. spoons), and flies.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the widely}} {{accepted}} importance of fish herbivory on coral reefs, {{few studies have}} considered the temporal variability {{in the nature of}} algalâ€“herbivore interactions. We therefore quantified monthly feeding intensity on Sargassum sp. bioassays for 12 mo with remote underwater video cameras deployed to identify the herbivores responsible for macroalgal removal on an inshore island of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Significantly higher removal rates were observed during the summer months whereas winter months were characterized by 4 times lower removal rates. However, rather than being simply changes in the feeding activity of a single species, this temporal pattern in herbivory also incorporated changes in the species responsible for the removal of Sargassum. Video analyses revealed that, of the 43 herbivore species recorded from the bay, only 3 {{played a significant role in}} Sargassum removal: Kyphosus vaigiensis, Naso unicornis and Scarus rivulatus. K. vaigiensis, a <b>rudderfish,</b> was primarily responsible for the removal of Sargassum during the summer months (83 % of the total recorded bites; 85553 bites). There was almost no feeding activity on Sargassum by K. vaigiensis during the winter months (82 bites). However, there was a reciprocal increase in feeding intensity on Sargassum by parrotfishes in the winter months, particularly S. rivulatus (71 bites during summer versus 2884 bites in winter). This temporal variability in herbivore functional roles suggests that functional redundancy on reefs may be less than previously assumed in that the feeding activities of fishes may be both spatially and temporally constrained...|$|E
