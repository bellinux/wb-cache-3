5|$|Coghlan {{directed}} {{his attention to}} Northern Rhodesia. Howard Moffat, his Minister for Mines and Works, had supervised mineral exploration in Northern Rhodesia twenty years earlier and so knew of the rich copper deposits across the Zambezi. However, Moffat's first public claim on the northern territory, in November 1925, was {{on the issue of}} control of the railway, which would grant control of the central African cattle trade. At the 1926 Imperial Conference in London, some degree of control over the railway was granted to Southern Rhodesia. There was also the issue of attracting labour for mines and farms from the far north and this gave impetus to Coghlan's and Moffat's territorial expansionism in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Coghlan called on Britain's Colonial Secretary, Leopold Amery, to give the North entirely to the South or at least the reversionary <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> but Amery refused this request. During his tour of Southern Rhodesia the following year, Amery appeared to give support to its claims to neighbouring territories. But by 1928, after Coghlan's death, both the Dominions Office and the Colonial Office were for maintaining Northern Rhodesia's territory intact, and favoured its association with the East African dependencies of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda.|$|E

Stewart received the temporalities of the abbey on 6 October 1526 until his death 1539.|$|E
500|$|MK Dons {{initially}} {{maintained that}} any debate was pointless as their club {{was simply a}} renamed Wimbledon F.C.. Winkelman was unequivocal when answering readers' questions in FourFourTwo magazine in November 2004: [...] "MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon share the same heritage, but we're the real child of Wimbledon", he wrote. One reader asked: [...] "Now that you have renamed the team, and changed the badge and colours, {{do you agree that}} AFC Wimbledon now carry the true spirit of Wimbledon?"; Winkelman replied that AFC Wimbledon's founders had betrayed their club and [...] "left their team before their team left them". In another answer, he poured scorn on suggestions that he might give Wimbledon F.C.'s trophy replicas to AFC Wimbledon, writing that the fans had [...] "abdicated their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> when they all walked away." [...] "The fans who have continued to support us from London—they're the ones who've {{had to put up with}} this shit for so long," [...] he concluded.|$|E

500|$|A {{person does}} not need to be a member of a clan society to be able to wear a crest badge. Any clan member has a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> not just clan {{societies}} and clan society members. According to the Court of the Lord Lyon clan membership goes with the surname. [...] Although, today many people who do not bear a clan surname do wear crest badges of their mother's clan, and anyone who offers their allegiance to a clan chief is a member of a clan (unless the chief decides to refuse that person's allegiance). Many people bear names that, while not actual clan surnames, are sept names or associated names of certain clans. Surnames such as Smith, Wright, Fletcher, and Miller are examples as such names that are associated names of many clans (as every clan would have its own smiths, wrights, fletchers and millers). It is up to the individual to explore their personal ancestry and discovery the correct clan that they belong to.|$|E
