40|$|This work {{is part of}} {{an ongoing}} project to develop a Superheated Superconducting Granule (SSG) {{detector}} for cold dark matter and neutrinos. The response of SSG devices to nuclear recoils has been explored irradiating SSG detectors with a 70 MeV neutron beam. The aim of the experiment was to test the sensitivity of Sn, Al and Zn SSG detectors to nuclear <b>recoil</b> <b>energies</b> down to a few keV. The detector consisted of a hollow teflon cylinder (0. 1 cm^ 3 inner volume) filled with tiny superconducting metastable granules embedded in a dielectric medium. The nuclear <b>recoil</b> <b>energies</b> deposited in the SSG were determined measuring the neutron scattering angles with a neutron hodoscope. Coincidences in time between the SSG and the hodoscope signals have been clearly established. In this paper the results of the neutron irradiation experiments at different SSG intrinsic thresholds are discussed and compared to Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that SSG are sensitive to <b>recoil</b> <b>energies</b> down to ∼ 1 keV. The limited angular resolution of the neutron hodoscope prevented us from measuring the SSG sensitivity to even lower <b>recoil</b> <b>energies.</b> Comment: 14 pages in pure LaTeX, 17 figures available on request from schmiemann@lhep. unibe. ch, submitted to Phys.

50|$|Perception of recoil {{is related}} to the {{deceleration}} the body provides against a recoiling gun, deceleration being a force that slows the velocity of the recoiling mass. Force applied over a distance is energy. The force that the body feels, therefore, is dissipating the kinetic <b>energy</b> of the <b>recoiling</b> gun mass. A heavier gun, that is a gun with more mass, will manifest lower <b>recoil</b> kinetic <b>energy,</b> and, generally, result in a lessened perception of recoil. Therefore, although determining the <b>recoiling</b> <b>energy</b> that must be dissipated through a counter-recoiling force is arrived at by conservation of momentum, kinetic <b>energy</b> of <b>recoil</b> is what is actually being restrained and dissipated. The ballistics analyst discovers this <b>recoil</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> through analysis of projectile momentum.|$|R

2500|$|The [...]380 ACP {{cartridge}} {{was derived}} from Browning's earlier [...]38 ACP design, which was only marginally more powerful. The [...]380 ACP {{was designed to be}} truly rimless, with headspace on the case mouth instead of the rim for better accuracy. These relatively low-powered designs were intended for blowback pistols which lacked a barrel locking mechanism, which is often required for any handgun firing a round more powerful than a [...]380. Using blowback operation, the design can be simplified, and lowered in cost; a locking mechanism is unnecessary, since the mass of the slide and strength of the recoil spring are enough to absorb the <b>recoil</b> <b>energy</b> of the round, due to the round's relatively low bolt thrust. Blowback operation also permits the barrel to be permanently fixed to the frame, which promotes accuracy, unlike a traditional short recoil-operation pistol, which requires a [...] "tilting" [...] barrel to unlock the slide and barrel assembly when cycling. A drawback of the blowback system is that it requires a certain amount of slide mass (weight) to counter the recoil of the round used. The higher the power the round, the heavier the slide assembly has to be in order for its inertia to safely absorb the recoil, meaning that a typical blowback pistol in a given caliber will be heavier than an equivalent recoil-operated weapon (alternatively, a very stiff spring will work, but will make operating the slide very difficult). Blowback weapons can be made in calibers larger than [...]380 ACP, but the required weight of slide and strength of spring makes this an unattractive option. Although the low power of the [...]380 ACP does not require a locking mechanism, there have also been a number of locked-breech pistols chambered in [...]380 ACP, such as the Remington Model 51, Kel-Tec P3AT and Glock 42; all three being designed to be lighter than blowback operated [...]380 ACP weapons.
