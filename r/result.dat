5|$|In the 1995 local {{elections}} the Progress Party regained {{the level of}} support seen at the 1987 elections. This was said largely to have been as a <b>result</b> of a focus on Progress Party core issues in the electoral campaign, especially immigration, {{as well as the}} party dominating the media picture as a <b>result</b> of the controversy around the 1995 Norwegian Association meeting at Godlia kino. The latter particularly gained the party many sympathy votes, as a <b>result</b> of the harsh media storm targeted against Hagen. In the 1997 parliamentary election, the party obtained 15.3% of the vote, {{and for the first time}} became the second largest political party in Norway. The 1999 {{local elections}} resulted in the party's first mayor as a direct <b>result</b> of an election, Terje Søviknes in Os. 20 municipalities also elected a deputy mayor from the Progress Party.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound is the <b>result</b> of a reaction between a strong acid and a weak base, the <b>result</b> is an acidic salt. If it is the <b>result</b> of a reaction between a strong base and a weak acid, the <b>result</b> is a basic salt. If it is the <b>result</b> of a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, the <b>result</b> is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E
