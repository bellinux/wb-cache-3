30|$|The {{morphological}} {{changes in}} wood tissues of Japanese beech (Fagus crenata) upon treatment with the ionic liquid, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([C 2 mim][Cl]), which can dissolve cellulose, were investigated. Treatment with [C 2 mim][Cl] induced significant swelling of all wood tissues. However, the swelling behavior of wood fibers {{was different from}} that of vessels. Intervascular pits were occluded, and pit membranes in <b>ray-vessel</b> pits were broken after treatment with [C 2 mim][Cl]. No significant differences in swelling behavior were found between latewood and earlywood, although different morphological changes for latewood and earlywood during [C 2 mim][Cl] treatment were seen in our previous studies on sugi (Cryptomeria japonica). We have found that the effects of [C 2 mim][Cl] on Japanese beech tissues are inhomogeneous and different from those found for other wood species.|$|E
40|$|The {{anatomy of}} 56 wood samples {{representing}} 11 native species of Eugenia s. str. was studied. Wood structure {{is described in}} detail with emphasis on the taxonomic value of qualitative and quantitative characteristics. Features observed in most samples include: wood diffuseporous; pores solitary; perforation plates simple; vestured pits in vessel elements of Van Vliet’s type B; vascular and vasicentric tracheids; fibre tracheids with vestured pits; axial parenchyma apotracheal; rays heterogeneous type I and II; <b>ray-vessel</b> pitting small and rounded; chambered axial parenchyma cells with prismatic crystals enclosed by a thick lignified sheath; intracellular deposits of tanniniferous substances; starch grains hollow; no visual distinction between heartwood and sapwood. Pith flecks were occasionally present and limited gummosis of pith fleck parenchyma resulted {{in the formation of}} gum veins. Crystalliferous chains in pith flecks resemble those of the secondary phloem. The wood anatomy of the species studied largely resembles that of Eugenia {{in other parts of the}} world and is quite distinct from that of Syzygium. No single characteristic or combination of characteristics could be found to be diagnostic at species level. Features that might be useful to distinguish between some species are average pore diameter and lack of tannin in ray cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{cortical}} microfilament (MF) {{component of}} the cytoskeleton within axial elements of the secondary vascular system of the angiosperm tree, Aesculus hippocastanum L. (horse-chestnut) was studied using transmission electron microscopy of ultrathin sections and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of actin in thick sections. As seen by electron microscopy, MF bundles have a net axial orientation within fusiform cambial cells and their secondary vascular derivatives (i. e. in the axial xylem and phloem parenchyma, xylem fibres, vessel and sieve elements, and companion cells). Immunofluorescence studies, however, reveal that this axial orientation can be more accurately described as a helix of extremely high pitch; it is a persistent feature of all axial secondary vascular elements during their development. Helical MF arrays are the only arrangement seen in secondary phloem cells. However, in addition to helices, other MF arrays are seen in secondary xylem cells. For example, fibres possess ellipses of MFs associated with simple-pit formation, and vessel elements possess circular arrays of MFs that associate with the developing inter-vessel bordered pits, <b>ray–vessel</b> contact pits, and with the perforation plate. Linear MF arrays are seen co-oriented with the developing tertiary wall-thickenings in vessel elements. The possible roles of MFs during the cytodifferentiation of secondary vascular cells is discussed, and {{compared with that of}} microtubules...|$|E
