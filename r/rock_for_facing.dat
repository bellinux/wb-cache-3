50|$|The quarry became disused in {{the early}} 20th century. It is remote and has {{developed}} an interesting flora and fauna. As a consequence there are restrictions {{on the use of}} the <b>rock</b> <b>faces</b> <b>for</b> mountaineering purposes. In particular, no climbing is allowed in the nesting season, and the faces which have the best plant growth are not permitted in the climbing routes.|$|R
5000|$|The edge, {{which is}} characterised as a steep <b>rock</b> <b>face</b> <b>for</b> {{much of its}} 4 km length, runs from grid {{reference}} [...] {{just east of the}} village of Deepcar in a roughly southeasterly direction to grid reference [...] just east of Wharncliffe Side. Wharncliffe Crags stand on {{the eastern side of the}} upper River Don valley at around 250 m above sea level, the highest spot height being 297 m. Although set in a pleasant situation, the northern end of the crags are never far away from the buzz of civilisation with the noise of the nearby Stocksbridge bypass and A6102 road ever-present; there are also two lines of electricity pylons, which converge at the northern end of the crags. The escarpment was formed 320 million years ago in the Paleozoic era.|$|R
50|$|In archaeology, palaeontology, and geomorphology, lichenometry is a geomorphic {{method of}} geochronologic dating that uses lichen growth to {{determine}} the age of exposed rock, based on a presumed specific rate of increase in radial size over time. Measuring {{the diameter of the}} largest lichen of a species on a rock surface can therefore be used {{to determine the}} length of time the rock has been exposed. Lichen can be preserved on old <b>rock</b> <b>faces</b> <b>for</b> up to 10,000 years, providing the maximum age limit of the technique, though it is most accurate (within 10% error) when applied to surfaces that have been exposed for less than 1,000 years. Lichenometry is especially useful for dating surfaces less than 500 years old, as radiocarbon dating techniques are less accurate over this period. The lichens most commonly used for lichenometry are those of the genera Rhizocarpon (e.g. the species Rhizocarpon geographicum) and Xanthoria.|$|R
50|$|When a S.T.A.R. Labs sub crashes {{far below}} the surface of the ocean, one of its {{scientists}} is exposed to experimental radiation. He is washed to shore, with memories of the life he had, and the woman he loved and lost. Alone on a desert island, he fights to survive, eating the local, tropical vegetation. When a leopard finds and attacks him, he unexpectedly emits a blast of radiation that vaporizes the feline's body. Eventually, he learns to use this power to his benefit, killing animals for food, and blasting away holes in the <b>rock</b> <b>faces</b> <b>for</b> shelter. The radiation soon takes its toll on him, as he remembers how he had caught his wife flirting with someone at a dance club and murdered her in a jealous rage. In anger, he destroys most of the island. His face, meanwhile, practically melts away, revealing his radioactive skull.|$|R
50|$|Lichenometry is a {{technique}} {{used to determine the}} age of exposed rock surfaces based on the size of lichen thalli. Introduced by Beschel in the 1950s, the technique has found many applications. it is used in archaeology, palaeontology, and geomorphology. It uses the presumed regular but slow rate of lichen growth to determine the age of exposed rock. Measuring the diameter (or other size measurement) of the largest lichen of a species on a rock surface indicates the length of time since the rock surface was first exposed. Lichen can be preserved on old <b>rock</b> <b>faces</b> <b>for</b> up to 10,000 years, providing the maximum age limit of the technique, though it is most accurate (within 10% error) when applied to surfaces that have been exposed for less than 1,000 years. Lichenometry is especially useful for dating surfaces less than 500 years old, as radiocarbon dating techniques are less accurate over this period. The lichens most commonly used for lichenometry are those of the genera Rhizocarpon (e.g. the species Rhizocarpon geographicum) and Xanthoria.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{discusses}} {{the requirements of}} the Quarries Regulations 1999 and suggests practical techniques {{that can be used to}} identify, evaluate and record hazards on quarry rock faces in strong rock. An attempt is made to explain, clarify and simplify the terminology and techniques involved in hazard and risk assessment where they relate to quarry excavations, and present a method of risk evaluation that is transparent, practical and does not rely on complex analytical techniques or probability analysis. In the system, single hazards are identified by a hazard appraisal and the danger to health and safety is evaluated in terms of a hazard level. This hazard level allows hazards to be ranked according to the seriousness of the danger and significant hazards identified. Where multiple hazards are present a hazard rating <b>for</b> the <b>face</b> can be calculated. Significant hazards are then separately evaluated by a geotechnical assessment and a risk rating is estimated by additionally considering exposure to the risks. Risk mitigation actions can be identified by taking into account the nature of the hazard and the risk rating. The two-stage system described is considered to satisfy the core requirements of the Quarries Regulations where the hazard appraisal is performed using competent judgement and the geotechnical assessment using expert judgement to form the basis of a practical and effective method of risk evaluation and management <b>for</b> <b>rock</b> <b>faces</b> in quarries.

50|$|Cost {{basis is}} needed because tax is due {{based on the}} gain in value of an asset. For example, if a person buys a <b>rock</b> <b>for</b> $20, and sells the same <b>rock</b> <b>for</b> $20, there is no tax, {{since there is no}} profit. If, however, that person buys a <b>rock</b> <b>for</b> $20 and then sells the same <b>rock</b> <b>for</b> $25, then there is a capital gain on the rock of $5, which is thus taxable. The {{purchase}} price of $20 is analogous to cost of sales.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Rock</b> <b>for</b> Choice {{concert series}} {{originated}} {{at about the}} same time as the Riot Grrrl movement, made up of a new generation of feminists and rock bands originating in Olympia, Washington. Both <b>Rock</b> <b>for</b> Choice and Riot Grrrl were reacting to the early 1990s bombing of abortion clinics by certain fringe elements of the pro-life movement, and were often associated in the public's mind as a single movement, although few Riot Grrrl bands, with the exception of Bikini Kill, ever played <b>Rock</b> <b>for</b> Choice shows. But <b>Rock</b> <b>for</b> Choice formed an important cultural bridge between the baby boomer feminists of the 1970s, who had organized the Feminist Majority, and the generation X feminists of the 1990s music scene.|$|R
