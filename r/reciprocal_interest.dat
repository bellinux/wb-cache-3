He had again petitioned Congress on the subject of his accounts. The Board of Treasury had made a report far short of his wishes. He had appealed, and his appeal, together with all the documents connected with the case, was referred to a committee of three. Old doubts and difficulties continued; there was no prospect of a speedy settlement; he was in extremity. [In his extremity he applied to the French minister, M. de Luzerne, a generous-spirited man, representing the hardships of his case, the ingratitude of his country, the hostility he had experienced from Pennsylvania, his urgent private necessities, and implored a loan equal to the amount of his debts, intimating that the attachment and gratitude of an American general of his rank and influence would be of vast importance to France in the transactions likely to arise between the two countries. M. de Luzerne, in reply, said that the league between France and America had for its basis a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>interest</b> and good will, and that it could be fulfilled without intrigue or secret practices. Arnold retired from the interview a mortified and desperate man; and writing to General Schuyler, who was about to visit the camp as one of the committee, expressed a wish to rejoin the army, and intimated that as his wounds made it painful for him to ride or walk, the command of West Point would best suit his present condition.] ...|$|E

Their economic interests and methods of expansion were different: Rome did not look to the sea, engaged first in defending itself against the neighbouring Samnites, Etruscans, Gauls, and Greeks, and then in conquering them; Carthage, lacking a real civic army and repelled in Sicily by the Greeks, appeared indecisive regarding its expansion strategy: while the aristocratic party was inclined to extend the power of the city into surrounding lands, the commercial party was more interested in exploiting trade routes and markets. By stipulating and observing four main treaties, the relationship between Rome and Carthage was one of tolerance for centuries. Carthage and Rome also concluded two treaties to end the First and Second Punic War in 241 BC and 201 BC, by which time the relationship between the powers had changed considerably.|$|R
5000|$|The village Littenweiler is {{mentioned}} {{for the first}} time in the 11th century as [...] "Lutenwile" [...] in a document of the Einsiedeln monastery. It has been a farming village located Eastern of the city of Freiburg at the edge of the Black Forest, where the Dreisam valley opens up to the Zartener basin in the East. Because the village’s church is dedicated to Saint Barbara the patron of miners, it can be assumed that miners lived in Littenweiler, who along with the residents of the neighbouring village Kappel (Freiburg im Breisgau) worked in the tunnels of the Schauinsland (called “Erzkasten”). After various property situations, the village was divided in 1560 into two districts: one district belonging to the lords of the House of Sickingen and the other district belonging to the Teutonic Order of Freiburg.

40|$|How World Trade Organization (WTO) rules {{relate to}} human rights norms, and whether one takes {{precedence}} over {{the other in the}} event of conflict remains a subject of contention. This article aims to demonstrate why human rights have primacy over WTO rules. Three lines of argument are advanced here. First, trade is merely a means to advance socioeconomic ends (most of which are recognized as human rights). Should conflict arise between the two, it remains to reason that the end must trump the means. Second, while WTO rules are ordinary treaty rules of reciprocal nature, at least certain human rights norms have peremptory status. Moreover, the U. N. Charter is the foundation for modern human rights law. Thus, the overriding character of the U. N. Charter, it is argued here, accords human rights a superior value compared to ordinary treaty rules. Finally, their peremptory status notwithstanding, human rights are distinct in that they are not statutory norms; they are inherent, inalienable, and universal entitlements of individuals, not of states. On the contrary, human rights are primarily meant to constrain {{the power of the state}} (including its contractual power) vis-d-vis the individual. Therefore, human rights transcend the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>interests</b> of trading nations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract__ This PhD-thesis {{presents}} the results of a study about leadership that promotes policy preferences of multiple actors with <b>reciprocal</b> <b>interests</b> to be of the same direction. The underlying assumption is that when preferences that consist of concrete measures will have more impact when they aim at realizing the same system state. The development of such policy preferences by different cooperating actors is conceptualized in this study as a process of social co-evolution. The multiple case study described and analyzed in this thesis is the Dutch Delta Program. To unravel the impact of leadership on the social co-evolution of these preferences this studies uses the term synchronization. We have defined synchronization as activities that contribute to developing preferences of the same direction. As a result of our case study we found that enabling leadership is the dominant type of leadership promoting synchronization of policy preferences. This corresponds to our theoretical expectations based on CLT. Based on the results of our case study we recommend further development of both theory and methods to study coevolution, leadership and synchronization concerning program management. We propose a specific conceptualization of administrative and enabling leadership for situations of program management within process systems. Our proposal is to consider administrative and enabling leadership as two ideal types stretching a continuum between maintaining existing boundary judgments (administrative leadership) and administratively applying adjusted boundary judgments that enable adaptations (enabling leadership) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to advance some ideas {{regarding}} future cooperation between Europe and Taiwan. The existing channels, such as the regular diplomacy and political lobbying, for some considered as hard diplomacy, as well as academic exchange opportunities are dealt with by respectively career diplomat participants as well as Taiwan Studies academics during other sessions of this conference. To extend the discussion on how to cultivate further Europe-Taiwan dialogue and interaction, the following contribution can be considered as a “soft diplomacy”, a parallel dimension to the above-mentioned “hard diplomacy”. In order to facilitate such soft diplomacy we believe a neutral, non-politicized, access-friendly exchange and dialogue platform should be created, parallel to the two existing contact channels of political lobbying and academic exchange. There is an undeniable importance to enhance the mutual understanding and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>interest</b> for ordinary citizens of Taiwan and Europe to discover common grounds for further cooperation. To this purpose we suggest observing the public sphere and civil society of each region and then identifying common issues for potential cooperation as a natural way to involve Taiwanese and European citizens in meeting, understanding, and collaborating with each other.

40|$|The Python {{programming}} language is steadily increasing in popularity as {{the language of}} choice for scientific computing. The ability of this scripting environment to access a huge code base in various languages, combined with its syntactical simplicity, make it the ideal tool for implementing and sharing ideas among scientists from numerous fields and with heterogeneous methodological backgrounds. The recent rise of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>interest</b> between the machine learning (ML) and neuroscience communities {{is an example of}} the desire for an inter-disciplinary transfer of computational methods that can benefit from a Python-based framework. For many years, a large fraction of both research communities have addressed, almost independently, very high-dimensional problems with almost completely non-overlapping methods. However, a number of recently published studies that applied ML methods to neuroscience research questions attracted a lot of attention from researchers from both fields, as well as the general public, and showed that this approach can provide novel and fruitful insights into the functioning of the brain. In this article we show how PyMVPA, a specialized Python framework for machine learning based data analysis, can help to facilitate this inter-disciplinary technology transfer by providing a single interface to a wide array of machine learning libraries and neural data-processing methods. We demonstrate the general applicability and power of PyMVPA via analyses of a number of neural data modalities, including fMRI, EEG, MEG, and extracellular recordings...|$|E
40|$|Sandro Nannini, Unconscious, {{consciousness}} and intentionality in cognitive naturalism New studies on unconscious show an increasing <b>reciprocal</b> <b>interest</b> between psychoanalysts {{on the one}} hand and neuroscientists and philosophers of mind oriented toward naturalism and materialism on the other hand. Such an orientation was already manifest in Freud’s Entwurf der Psychologie and other essays. Moreover Freud could deny Descartes’ identification of mind to consciousness thanks to F. Brentano’s concept of intentionality. Freud could maintain that unconscious states such lapsus are strictly mental acts endowed with a goal, a content and a meaning, although they are not conscious, only because he followed Brentano and did not define mentality by its identification to consciousness but by its being endowed with intentionality. However, Freud unlike Brentano was not a dualist and oscillated between materialism and functionalism with regard to the Mind-Body Problem. Therefore, one can read in Freud’s psychoanalysis the attempt to reconcile naturalism with an anticartesian concept of mentality based on intentionality and not on consciousness. The same attempt can be recognized in philosophers of mind such as D. C. Dennett or the Churchlands. More in general, {{consciousness and}} the self can be naturalized only if intentionality has been previously reduced to a first order property of brain dynamics. In this perspective consciousness is reducible to a higher order property (a “format”) that gives unity and coherence to certain parts of brain activity. To sum up, those psychoanalysts who correct Freud’s theories in the light of contemporary neurosciences do not betray him but realize his deepest aspiration...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} how {{the structure}} of cabaret was translated into painting by the artists of the Weimar era. German cabaret was a theatrical art form that actively welcomed visual artists into its domain. In turn, German artists responded to their shared strategies of art making, recognizing their common bond of Nietzsche’s aesthetic and existential philosophy. Both shared progressive, leftist political concerns, solidifying their <b>reciprocal</b> <b>interests</b> and mutual concerns. Also, the cabaret environment provided artists with a setting in which to explore the social and psychological manifestations found in their culture, and to find inspiration from its dazzling array of types. Both cabaret’s text and performances were directed towards an audience representing a microcosm of its society, and this was understood by visual artists who adapted cabaret’s course of action and common targets. This in turn provided artists with a method to transform the language of images into a critique expressed within their own works. And this environment of cabaret’s conceptual palette of human behavioral types and performance structures, mixed with the artists’ social and historical conditions, together with their readings {{of the works of}} Nietzsche and Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk, resulted in the creation of intermedial works of art. Such works differed from the era’s New Objectivity style that was characterized by a lack of emotional content, in including cabaret’s spectacle of amusement and heightened emotional levity to emphasize the extreme social disparities and injustices of their time...|$|R

City-regions 1 have become the preferred targets for attacks against collective security, driving city authorities to be increasingly involved in the management and enforcement of security policies (Tebaldi 2016). To face the challenges of these highly populated territories, city-regions are increasingly relying on new technologies. Smart cities {{are based on the}} idea of achieving sustainable development and a high quality of life thanks to the ‘smart’ use of human and social capital and technologies (Dameri 2013, Giffinger et al. 2007). Smart cities rely on data and the idea of algorithmic management of life: traffic data to develop intelligent transportation systems, medical data for health policies, feedback data for policies development and so on. From this point of view, smart cities and online platforms are of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>interest.</b> Online platforms are “digital infrastructures coordinating access to services, products, data, and content, primarily through algorithmic matching” (Casilli 2017, p. 2068). Online platforms appeal to the management of smart cities, as they are in control of the collection and gathering of data and metadata from users/citizens. At the same time smart cities represent an essential market for platform companies, which, like Uber or Airbnb, are increasingly involved in the management of cities (Gregory 2018). Platforms technology can help developing smart cities, {{but at the same time}} can creates new threats.

Therefore, political conflicts between two states will influence the economical relation.   This research analyses how far the implication of political conflict toward economic relation by observing trade relation between Indonesia and Australia, especially on trade of goods. As we know, Australia gives a great contribution on the separation of East Timor which impact on the strained political relations between Indonesia - Australia. Furthermore, this strained political relation indicates the lowest rate {{in the history of}} these two country bilateral relationship. Several incidents emphasize this fact:many demonstration which shows the people's hatred from these two countries, the destruction of the embassy building of the two countries, the destruction of Australian Consulate's car, the flag burning, the cancelation of the agreement by Indonesia and the rise of anti Indonesia and anti Australia feeling. Using qualitative method and analysis, the result of this research shows that political conflicts have no significant influence on economy especially trade relation between Indonesia and Australia, which is determined by the rising volume and value of export and import in 2000. This condition due to: (1) The exist criticism emerges only on the top level or the state elite and related association, so conflict does not spread to the low level. (2) The boycott action is only taken by Australian Council Trade Union/ACTU and Maritime Union of Australian/MUA {{in a very short time}} from September 8 - 22, 1999. (3) There is a quick efforts to restore bilateral relation. (4) There is a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>interest</b> between Indonesia and Australia.

40|$|Advertising {{has long}} been of {{interest}} to semiotic, linguistics and pragmatic theorists including Barthes (1957; 1977), Williamson (1978), Myers (1994), Cook (2001) and Tanaka (1994). Marketing scholars, including Brierley (2002) and Beaseley (in Beaseley & Danesi, 2002) show a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>interest</b> in the potential for semiotics to advance their discipline, {{but there is no}} apparent awareness of theories of pragmatics or its relevance to their field. While semiotics offers a tool in understanding how meaning is conveyed through linguistic and non-linguistic signs, pragmatics focuses upon language, speaker intentions and the interpretation of utterances in context. This study compares these two approaches in understanding the creative processes involved in the design of advertisements. Universities and professional bodies were contacted to ascertain whether these subjects were taught to prospective and practising advertising professionals and, if so, what was the precise content. Considerable variation is found between institutions, ranging from no input to a moderate level of input in semiotics; pragmatics is absent in the syllabus. Where semiotics is taught, it is confined to using theories to deconstruct selected advertisements rather than employing semiotic principles as a design technique. In addition, five copywriters are interviewed to ascertain their awareness of semiotics and, more generally, the creative processes they adopt. While a vague knowledge of the theories is reported, and some appreciation of their possible relevance to the industry, practitioners make no attempt to apply semiotics systematically in their design practices. There is evidence of an awareness of the effects of signification and context which aligns with the theoretical frameworks, although this alignment can be explained more through intuition and job experience than a conscious application of theories. It is recommended that further research should be conducted into the value of teaching semiotics to marketing students, that an applied semiotic method is developed specifically for students of advertising and that consideration is given to incorporating aspects of pragmatics into their training...|$|E

It considers that the author’s formulations are answers to the contradictory demands of society. The huge development of industry, science, technology and urban life favored confidence in human welfare in a society undergoing a process of change and growth.
