Second opportunity is when the user receives ‘Like!’ or comments from other participants on their posts. We think that users can <b>reflect</b> objectively <b>by</b> receiving evaluation from others.|$|R

5|$|After Mindaugas' death, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania entered {{times of}} {{relative}} instability, as <b>reflected</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact that}} seven Grand Dukes held the title {{over the course of}} the next 32 years. Little is known about this period, but the Gediminid dynasty was founded in about 1280. Despite the instability, the Grand Duchy did not disintegrate. Vytenis assumed power in 1295, and during the next 20 years laid solid foundations for the Duchy to expand and grow under the leadership of Gediminas and his son Algirdas. While the Grand Duchy was established between 1219 and 1295, the years after 1295 marked its expansion.|$|E

The FPÖ opposed Austria's joining the EU in 1994, and promoted a popular initiative against the replacement of the Austrian Schilling with the Euro in 1998, but to no avail. Owing to perceived differences between Turkish and European culture, the party opposes the accession of Turkey to the EU; it has declared that should this happen, Austria must immediately leave the EU.|$|E

5|$|Eolambia {{would have}} lived in a forested {{environment}} {{at the edge of}} lakes in a humid floodplain environment, feeding on gymnosperms, ferns, and flowering plants. The water levels in the lakes changed over time with cyclical wet and dry spells caused by the precession of the Earth, <b>reflected</b> <b>by</b> alternating bands in the sediments of the Mussentuchit Member. As a juvenile, Eolambia would have been preyed upon by large crocodylomorphs residing in the lake waters. With increasing age, however, they became impervious to the crocodylomorphs, and mature individuals (at least eight to nine years in age) were preyed on by large theropods such as the neovenatorid Siats.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus Sepioteuthis, bigfin reef squids are easy to {{distinguish}} from other squids in that they possess thick and muscular oval fins that extend around almost the entire mantle. The fins extend about 83 to 97% of the mantle length and are 67 to 70% of the mantle length in width. Because of these fins, bigfin reef squids are sometimes mistaken for cuttlefish, a fact <b>reflected</b> <b>by</b> their scientific names. A narrow blue or white line is visible at the point of attachment of the fins to the mantle. A fleshy ridge is also present where the fins meet {{at the back of the}} squid.|$|E

5|$|The 2004 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was notable in that no tropical cyclone {{of at least}} tropical storm intensity moved ashore, an unusual occurrence. The season officially began on May15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June1 in the central Pacific; it officially ended in both basins on November30. These dates conventionally delimit the period during each year when a majority of tropical cyclones form. Activity throughout the year fell slightly below the long-term average, with 12 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.

On defense, State gave up an average of 402yards per game, while Tech allowed an average of 366yards. NC State averaged almost 28points per game, while Virginia Tech averaged just over 24points.

5|$|A {{light ray}} {{emanating from the}} source S is <b>reflected</b> <b>by</b> a beam {{splitter}} G and is collimated into a parallel beam by lens L. After passing the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through the tubes A1 and A2, through which water is streaming {{back and forth as}} shown by the arrows. The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L, so that one ray always propagates {{in the same direction as}} the water stream, and the other ray opposite to the direction of the water stream. After passing back and forth through the tubes, both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated eyepiece. The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.|$|E

Light polarized in the plane {{is said to be}} p-polarized, while that polarized perpendicular to it is s-polarized. At a special angle known as Brewster's angle, no p-polarized light is reflected from the surface, thus all reflected light must be s-polarized, with an electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence.|$|R
