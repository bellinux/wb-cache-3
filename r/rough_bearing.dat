40|$|For ultra-thin gas lubrication, the surface-to-volume ratio {{increases}} dramatically when {{flow geometry}} is scaled {{down to the}} micro/nano-meter scale, where surface roughness, albeit small, may {{play an important role}} in gas slider bearings. However, the effect of surface roughness on the pressure and load capacity (force) in gas slider bearings has been overlooked. In this paper, on the basis of the generalized Reynolds equation, we investigate the behavior of a gas slider bearing, where the roughness of the slider surface is characterized by the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot fractal function, and the mass flow rates of Couette and Poiseuille flows are obtained by deterministic solutions to the linearized Bhatnager-Gross-Krook equation. Our results show that the surface roughness reduces the local mass flow rate as compared to the smooth channel, but the amount of reduction varies for Couette and Poiseuille flows of different Knudsen numbers. As a consequence, the pressure rise and load capacity in the <b>rough</b> <b>bearing</b> become larger than the smooth bearing in the slip and early transition flow regimes, e. g. a 6 % roughness could lead to an increase of 20 % more bearing load capacity. However, this situation is reversed in the free-molecular flow regime, as the ratio of mass flow rate between Couette and Poiseuille flows is smaller than that in the smooth channel. Interestingly, between the two extremes, we have found a novel "rarefaction cloaking" effect, where the load capacity of a <b>rough</b> <b>bearing</b> equals to that of a smooth bearing at a certain range of Knudsen numbers, as if the roughness does not exist...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} an {{approach}} has been developed to investigate the influence of surface roughness on thermohydrodynamic performance in aligned and misaligned journal bearings by considering an average flow model and deriving the shear flow factor for various roughness configurations, similar to the pressure flow factor. An average Reynolds equation for rough surfaces is defined in term of pressure and shear flow factors, which {{can be obtained by}} numerical flow simulation, though the use of measured or numerically generated rough surfaces. Reynolds, heat conduction and energy equations are solved simultaneously by using a suitable numerical technique (Finite Difference Method) to obtain the pressure and temperature distribution through the oil film thickness of the journal bearing. These equations are obtained for isotropic surfaces and for surfaces with directional patterns. The flow factors for these surfaces are expressed as empirical relations in term of normalized oil film thickness (h/&# 963;) and surface characteristic (&# 947;) defined as the ratio of x and z correlation lengths. The results of this approach showed increase in load carrying capacity and maximum pressure and decrease in maximum temperature in the case of stationary surface roughness (<b>rough</b> <b>bearing</b> and smooth journal) with transverse pattern.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the effect of}} surface {{roughness}} properties on the steady-state and dynamic characteristics of hydro dynamic journal bearing using non-Newtonian lubricants obeying power-law model. An analytical expression for average film thickness is obtained and introduced in the modified Reynolds equation. The resulting differential equation is then solved by the finite difference method with a successive over-relaxation scheme. The modified Reynolds equation with rough surfaces having Gaussian distribution has been solved using the non-linear transient approach to determine the stability parameters considering longitudinal, transverse and isotropic roughness patterns. The equation of motion is then solved by the fourth-order Runge- Kutta method. The results are compared with established results for smooth bearings. It is found from the detailed analysis that roughness parameter considerably influences stability of journal bearings. Stability is highest when the bearing is rough than journal. Surface pattern orientation of bearings has {{an important role in}} determining the stable running of a bearing. Improvement in stability not only depends on whether the surfaces have isotropically, longitudinally, or transversely oriented surface but also on the variation in the roughness between journal and bearing. Transversely oriented surface with <b>rough</b> <b>bearing</b> gives higher stability. Lower L/D ratios (short bearing) gives better stability characteristics. Non-Newtonian effects cause the maximum film pressure to increase. It is observed from the pressure distribution that for different values of flow behavior index, non-Newtonian lubricants show flatter pressure distribution which is advantageous for bearings subjected to oscillatory loads...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} surface {{roughness}} on the load capacity and friction force of hydrodynamic bearings has received considerable interest from scientists and engineers. Surfaces of most engineered materials are textured {{at some level}} either deliberately to achieve some desired effect or produced by wear and friction of surfaces.

The implementation of sinusoidal roughness model is verified using a verification problem. Reynolds’ lubrication theory, derived from thin-region approximations of the Navier-Stokes equations, is used as the main tool for this study. The performance of a <b>rough</b> slider <b>bearing</b> is compared with a corresponding smooth slider bearing. The presence of roughness tends to increase the load capacity of a slider bearing at high amplitudes and low wavelengths.

40|$|This article aims {{to analyze}} the {{performance}} of a magnetic-fluid-based porous <b>rough</b> step <b>bearing</b> considering slip velocity. The Neuringer-Rosensweig model governs the fluid flow while the velocity slip is modeled by the method of Beavers and Joseph. The bearing surfaces are assumed transversely rough and the transverse surface roughness of the bearing surfaces is characterized by a stochastic random variable with non-zero mean, variance, and skewness. With the usual assumptions of hydrodynamic lubrication, the related stochastically averaged Reynolds’ equation for the fluid pressure is solved with appropriate boundary conditions, which is then used to calculate the load-carrying capacity. It is found that although the bearing suffers owing to transverse surface roughness, the performance of the bearing system can be improved to some extent by the positive effect of magnetization, considering the slip parameter at the minimum; at least in the case of negatively skewed roughness. A comparison of this paper with some established investigations indicates that here, the reduction of load-carrying capacity due to porosity and slip velocity is comparatively less, especially, when negative variance occurs. In augmenting the performance of the bearing system, the step ratio plays a central role, even if the slip parameter is at the minimum...|$|R

At slightly higher detergent concentrations (0. 12 - 0. 16 %) membrane areas bearing ribosomal aggregates invaginated into the microsomal lumen and separated {{from the rest of the}} membrane. Two distinct classes of vesicles could be isolated by density gradient centrifugation from microsomes treated with 0. 16 % Triton X- 100 : one with ribosomes bound to the inner membrane surfaces ("inverted rough" vesicles) and another with no ribosomes attached to the membranes. Analysis of the fractions showed that approximately 30 % of the phospholipids and 20 - 30 % of the total membrane protein were released from the membranes by this treatment. Labeling with avidin-ferritin conjugates demonstrated that concanavalin A binding sites, which in native rough microsomes are found in the luminal face of the membranes, were present on the outer surface of the inverted rough vesicles.

The magnetic field is oblique to the stator and the bearing surfaces are considered to be transversely rough. The roughness of the bearing surface is characterized by a stochastically random variable with non-zero mean, variance and skewness. The concerned Reynolds equation is stochastically averaged with respect to the random roughness parameters. This stochastically averaged equation is solved with suitable boundary conditions to obtain the expression of pressure distribution, which is then used to calculate the load carrying capacity. Besides, friction is also computed. The results show that the transverse surface roughness affects the performance of the bearing system adversely. It is seen that the load carrying capacity increases while friction decreases due to the magnetic fluid lubricant. It is revealed that the negative effect of transverse roughness can be minimized to certain extent by the positive effect of the magnetization in the case of negatively skew roughness. It is noticed that positively skewed roughness and variance (+ve) decrease the friction.
