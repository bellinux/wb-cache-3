5000|$|<b>Ruddy</b> <b>turnstones</b> {{engage in}} a variety of {{behaviours}} to locate and capture prey. These behaviours can be placed into six general categories: ...|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} {{wintering}} sites, <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstones</b> are particularly faithful to specific locations. A {{study published in}} 2009 examined turnstones wintering along a stretch of coastline in the Firth of Clyde. It found that 95% of birds resident to the area {{at the end of}} winter returned the following autumn. The same study also confirmed <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstones</b> as one of the longest lived wader species, with annual adult mortality rates of under 15%. Their average lifespan is 9 years with 19 years and 2 months being the longest recorded.|$|R
25|$|Kiritimati's lagoon and the saltflats are a prime {{location}} for migratory birds to stop over or even stay all winter. The most commonly seen migrants are <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstone</b> (Arenaria interpres), Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva), bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis) and wandering tattler (Tringa incana); other seabirds, waders and even dabbling ducks can be encountered {{every now and}} then.|$|E
25|$|Several {{varieties}} of shorebirds {{and other species}} inhabit the island and nearby waters, some considered endangered. The <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstone,</b> bar-tailed godwit, sanderling and Pacific golden plover are considered species of least concern. The bristle-thighed curlew is considered vulnerable on the national conservation priority scheme. Green turtles and hawksbill turtles, both critically endangered, can be found along the reef.|$|E
25|$|The furry-legged rock {{ptarmigan}} {{is a widespread}} bird in this region. Typical birds of prey include the gyrfalcon and snowy owl. Some of the more widespread shore and seabirds are the thick-billed murre, black-legged kittiwake, <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstone,</b> red knot, black guillemot, widespread ringed plover, little ringed plover and northern fulmar. Songbirds found in the Arctic Cordillera include the hoary redpoll, common redpoll, snow bunting, and Lapland longspur. The snow goose, common and king eider, and red-throated loon are some species of waterfowl {{that live in the}} region.|$|E
30|$|Observations at East Bay 1999 – 2007 {{suggest that}} <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstones</b> nest early {{relative}} to the other three species, and white-rumped sandpipers nest late and {{over a longer period}} (Smith et al. 2010). The elevated (albeit, non-significant) levels of mercury in the eggs of white-rumped sandpipers relative to <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstones,</b> and the great variability in concentrations for white-rumped sandpipers are consistent with an effect of amount time spent foraging on the breeding grounds. In the future, testing for an effect of nest initiation date on egg mercury concentration (with a larger sample size) could provide some insight into how pre-breeding activities (e.g., foraging) affect mercury dynamics.|$|R
50|$|They are late {{migrants}} {{and move}} to rocky ice-free Atlantic coasts in winter. most go no further south than North Carolina and northern Portugal. They are fairly gregarious, forming small flocks, often with <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstones.</b> This species is tame and approachable.|$|R
40|$|Vagrant birds {{recorded}} ashore at Marion Island and Prince Edward Island from 1987 to 2009 are documented. In total, 101 observations (including multiple {{sightings of}} potentially the same individual) of 29 species were made. Palaearctic and Holarctic migrants (17 species), African species (n = 6) and pelagic species with a predominantly Southern Ocean distribution (n = 6) were observed. The number of observations peaked during the austral autumn, which corresponded {{to both the}} northward migration of Palaearctic species and maximum observer effort. <b>Ruddy</b> <b>turnstones</b> Arenaria interpres, barn swallows Hirundo rustica, common house-martins Delichon urbicum and cattle egrets Bubulcus ibis were most frequently observed; <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstones</b> and common house-martins apparently increasing in occurrence {{over the past two}} decades...|$|R
25|$|As of 2006, the {{following}} birds {{have been observed}} - Richard's pipit, wedge tailed eagle, white-faced heron, eastern reef egret, <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstone,</b> masked woodswallow, galah, red-necked stint, Cape Barren geese, Horsfield's rufous tailed, Australian raven, white-fronted chat, crimson chat, rockhopper penguin, Australian kestrel, white bellied sea eagle, welcome swallow, silver gull, Pacific gull, singing honeyeater, budgerigah, rock parrot, golden whistler, osprey, house sparrow, red-capped robin, red-tailed tropicbird, great cormorant, white-browed scrubwren, crested tern, common starling, hooded dotterel, barn owl, masked plover, silver eye and breeding colonies of fairy tern, little penguin and sooty oystercatcher.|$|E
25|$|Many coastal {{birds are}} {{frequently}} found in Rottnest. These include the pied cormorant, osprey, pied oystercatcher, silver gull, crested tern, fairy tern, bridled tern, rock parrot and the reef heron. The island salt lakes contain brine shrimp which support birds {{such as the}} red-necked avocet, banded stilt, <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstone,</b> curlew sandpiper, red-capped dotterel, Australian shelduck, red-necked stint, grey plover, white-fronted chat, Caspian tern and the crested tern. Several pairs of osprey nest at Rottnest each year; one nest at Salmon Point {{is estimated to be}} 70 years old. Introduced peafowl are often seen near the main settlement.|$|E
25|$|Yala {{is one of}} the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Of 215 {{bird species}} of the park, seven are endemic to Sri Lanka. They are Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, crimson-fronted barbet, black-capped bulbul, blue-tailed {{bee-eater}} and brown-capped babbler. The number of waterbirds inhabiting wetlands of Yala is 90 and half of them are migrants. Waterfowl (lesser whistling duck, garganey), cormorants (little cormorant, Indian cormorant), large waterbirds (grey heron, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, Asian openbill, painted stork), medium-sized waders Tringa spp., and small waders Charadrius spp. are among the most common waterbirds. Black-necked stork and lesser adjutant are many of the rare birds that {{can be seen in the}} park. The migrant great white pelican and resident spot-billed pelican are also have been recorded. Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include lesser flamingo, pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, white-winged tern, Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, godwits, and <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstone.</b> The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew. Rock pigeon, barred buttonquail, Indian peafowl, black stork, black-winged stilt, and greater flamingo are among the other bird species. Crested serpent eagle and white-bellied sea eagle are the raptors of the park. The forest birds are orange-breasted green pigeon, hornbills, Old World flycatchers, Indian paradise flycatcher, Asian barbets, and orioles.|$|E
50|$|Other birds {{breeding}} on {{the islands}} include masked boobies, Australian pelicans, lesser frigatebirds, eastern reef egrets, silver gulls, crested, bridled and lesser crested terns, common noddies, and pied and sooty oystercatchers. Visiting waders include grey-tailed tattlers, <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstones,</b> great knots and greater sand plovers.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether shorebirds breeding in the High Arctic have relatively {{high rates of}} energy expenditure due to the harsh climatic conditions that prevail even in summer, we measured daily energy expenditure (DEE) and water turnover of <b>Ruddy</b> <b>Turnstones</b> (Arenaria interpres) during the incubation phase on Rowley Island in Foxe Basin, N. W. T., Canada, at 69 °N, using the doubly-labeled-water technique. Simultaneously, we conducted detailed measurements of ambient climatic conditions, including in situ measurements with heated taxidermic mounts. A series of 11 doubly-labeled-water measurements with eight individual <b>Ruddy</b> <b>Turnstones,</b> of which at least seven successfully hatched eggs, yielded a mean DEE of 4. 08 W. This is a relatively high value for a 108 -g bird, equalling four times their basal metabolic rate (BMR). Most variation in DEE was attributable to standard operative temperature, which combines the effects of air temperature, wind and radiation on heat loss from the turnstone's point of view. On average, 25 % of DEE was attributable to BMR, 31 % {{to the cost of}} thermoregulation, and 44 % to the cost of activity. The average value for water turnover of 96. 6 g/day is high compared to published values for other birds and confirms the large requirement for food (which is water-rich) of incubating <b>Ruddy</b> <b>Turnstones.</b> An analysis of the climatic conditions prevalent in Foxe Basin during the breeding seasons of <b>Ruddy</b> <b>Turnstones,</b> based on the 33 -year period 1958 - 1990, indicated that they faced thermostatic hardships, defined as energy expenditure exceeding the maximum sustained working level (estimated at 4. 5 times BMR), on 15 % of the days. Climatic conditions were most severe in the early 1960 s, but have improved since. ...|$|R
5|$|Adult terns may be hunted by owls and raptors, {{and their}} chicks and eggs {{may be taken}} by herons, crows or gulls. Less obvious nest predators include <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstones</b> in the Arctic, and gull-billed terns in little tern colonies. Adults may be robbed of their catch by avian kleptoparasites such as frigatebirds, skuas, other terns or large gulls.|$|R
2500|$|Nineteen {{bird species}} are {{presently}} known on Toke Atoll. These include the reef heron, the migratory pectoral sandpiper and accidental {{examples of the}} spotted sandpiper and skua, for which Toke is their only sighting in Marshall Islands. Others include the resident [...] crested tern, sooty tern, brown noddy, black noddy, white tern, black-naped tern, and the migrant wedge-tailed shearwater, red-tailed tropicbird, red-footed booby, brown booby, great frigatebird, golden plover, bristle-thighed curlew, wandering tattler, and <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstone.</b>|$|E

50|$|Akekeke (<b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstone,</b> Arenaria interpres) {{is a small}} shorebird easily {{identified}} by the bold black and white pattern on its wings, and its black “necklace.” Named for its feeding behavior, the <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstone</b> uses its strong neck and bill to turn over stones in search of prey. It can be seen year round on Kauai but is abundant in spring and fall.|$|E
5000|$|The {{saltmarsh}} and fringing farmland provide {{habitat for}} critically endangered orange-bellied parrots on migration, {{as well as}} flame robins and many of Tasmania’s endemic bird species. [...] Significant numbers of <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstones</b> and Far Eastern curlews have been recorded. White-bellied sea eagles and Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles breed within the site. The IBA also supports some 242,000 breeding pairs of short-tailed shearwaters.|$|R
40|$|To {{cope with}} changes in the environment, organisms not only show {{behavioural}} but also phenotypic adjustments. This is well established for the digestive tract. Here we present a first case of birds adjusting their flight machinery in response to predation risk. In an indoor experiment, <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstones</b> Arenaria interpres were subjected to an unpredictable daily appearance of either a raptor or a small gull (as a control). <b>Ruddy</b> <b>turnstones</b> experiencing threat induced by a flying raptor model, longer than after similar passage by the gull model, refrained from feeding after this disturbance. Pectoral muscle mass, but not lean mass, responded in a course of {{a few days to}} changes in the perceived threat of predation. Pectoral muscle mass increased after raptor scares. Taking the small increases in body mass into account, pectoral muscle mass was 3. 6 % higher than aerodynamically predicted for constant flight performance. This demonstrates that perceived risk factors may directly affect organ size. ...|$|R
50|$|This new marsh, {{together}} with another, {{designed to be}} managed as a brackish marsh with lagoons, now forms an RSPB reserve. Freiston Shore is home to pied avocets, common redshanks, ringed plovers, northern wheatears and marsh harriers in spring and summer. In the autumn and winter migrating waders such as common redshanks, <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstones,</b> dunlins, and waterfowl such as dark-bellied brent goose and Eurasian wigeon, can be seen.|$|R

50|$|The <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstone</b> has a staccato, {{rattling}} {{call and}} also a chattering alarm-call which is mainly given during the breeding season.|$|E
50|$|The plumage {{patterns}} of <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstones</b> exhibit an unusual {{amount of variation}} in comparison with other shorebirds. Turnstones use these unique plumage patterns to recognize individuals and discriminate intruders in their territory from neighbours occupying an adjacent territory. When a fake fiberglass turnstone model is placed in a turnstone's territory, the occupant {{is less likely to}} respond aggressively if the model is painted to have the plumage pattern of a neighbouring turnstone.|$|R
5|$|The {{keys are}} a {{transitional}} area capable of hosting unexpected birds, often Caribbean species that have strayed near the mainland. The {{interior of the}} keys are frequented by warblers and the hawks that prey on them. Coastal zones are habitat for <b>ruddy</b> <b>turnstones</b> and least sandpipers. Gulls and terns include royal terns, laughing gulls and ring-billed gulls, with brown pelicans just offshore. Wilson's plovers nest on Boca Chita Key, where nesting zones are closed during breeding season.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ruddy</b> <b>turnstones</b> {{can survive}} {{in a wide range}} of {{habitats}} and climatic conditions from Arctic to tropical. The typical breeding habitat is open tundra with water nearby. Outside the breeding season, it is found along coasts, particularly on rocky or stony shores. It is often found on man-made structures such as breakwaters and jetties. It may venture onto open grassy areas near the coast. Small numbers sometimes turn up on inland wetlands, especially during the spring and autumn migrations.|$|R

40|$|Foraging birds {{can manage}} time spent {{vigilant}} for predators by forming groups of various sizes. However, group size {{alone will not}} always reliably determine the optimal level of vigilance. For example, variation in predation risk or food quality between patches may also be influential. In a field setting, we assessed how simultaneous variation in predation risk and intake rate affects the relationship between vigilance and group size in foraging <b>Ruddy</b> <b>Turnstones</b> Arenaria interpres. We compared vigilance, measured {{as the number of}} ‘head-ups’ per unit time, in habitat types that differed greatly in prey energy content and proximity to cover from which predators could launch surprise attacks. Habitats closer to predator cover provided foragers with much higher potential net energy intake rates than habitats further from cover. Foragers formed larger and denser flocks on habitats closer to cover. Individual vigilance of foragers in all habitats declined with increasing flock size and increased with flock density. However, vigilance by foragers on habitats closer to cover was always higher for a given flock size than vigilance by foragers on habitats further from cover, and habitat remained an important predictor of vigilance in models including a range of potential confounding variables. Our results suggest that foraging <b>Ruddy</b> <b>Turnstones</b> can simultaneously assess information on group size and the general likelihood of predator attack when determining their vigilanc...|$|R
