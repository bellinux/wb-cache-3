5|$|Immunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to P.falciparum malaria {{does occur}} naturally, {{but only in}} {{response}} to years of <b>repeated</b> <b>infection.</b> An individual can be protected from a P.falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry {{a version of the}} parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of X-ray irradiation. The highly polymorphic nature of many P.falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito. Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own. For example, SPf66 was tested extensively in areas where the disease is common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.|$|E
25|$|These {{days there}} is not much disputing that Ixodes holocyclus is the main vector for Rickettsial Spotted Fever (also known as Queensland tick typhus) (causative {{organism}} the bacteria Rickettsia australis) and Flinders Island Spotted Fever (causative organism Rickettsia honei). Rickettsia australis is an obligate, intracellular bacterial parasite that proliferates within the endothelial cells of small blood vessels, causing a vasculitis. Spotted Fever is probably more common than the Lyme-like Disease. Sometimes infection with Rickettsia australis occurs without a rash - there may just be a high fever. Usually (65% of cases) there is a black spot (known as an eschar, usually 2–5mm in diameter) {{at the site of the}} tick bite. This looks like a scab with redness and swelling around it. Usually there is only one eschar unless there has been more than one tick bite. Often lymph glands nearby are enlarged and painful. Fever starts 1–14 days (usually 7–10 days) following the tick bite, followed within a few days by a rash. The rash can look like chicken pox as the spots may contain some fluid. Other symptoms include headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, aching muscles and joints. The illness may be more severe in adults and elderly persons. Spotted Fever is diagnosed by two blood tests (IgM and Weil-Felix tests) taken 10 days apart. PCR analysis of skin biopsies is a more recent testing method. The disease runs its course in two weeks or so but can be cured more quickly with antibiotics (tetracyclines). As antibiotic treatment is very effective, many persons feel so well that they do not return to have the second blood sample collected. But this second blood test is important as it is the only way of proving the diagnosis of Spotted Fever. Spotted Fever rarely, if ever, occurs more than once because the body usually becomes immune for life. In rare instances there may be an apparent <b>repeated</b> <b>infection</b> after recovery - it is not known whether this is caused by another strain. It is also presently unknown if chronic infections occur. It is rarely fatal. Australian Spotted Fever was first described in 1946 when 12 soldiers contracted the disease during training exercises in north Queensland - it was at that time known as Queensland Tick Typhus (QTT). Infections generally arise in rural areas, but 10% of reported cases appear to have been acquired in major cities. It is apparently commonly seen in tick collectors in southern Queensland. It mostly occurs during the winter and spring, but can occur at any time in temperate areas.|$|E

40|$|Background Young African-American {{women have}} {{the highest rates of}} Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the United States. The {{objective}} was to identify baseline predictors of repeat Chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea infections among African-American adolescent females. Methods Sociodemographic, psychosocial and behavioural data were collected at baseline and every 6 months for 2 years from 701 African-American females (14 – 20 years) enrolled in an HIV prevention trial. Vaginal swabs were self-collected at each visit and assayed for Chlamydia and gonorrhoea using DNA amplification. Among participants testing positive for Chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea at baseline, logistic regression analyses assessed baseline predictors of <b>repeat</b> <b>infection.</b> Results Of 618 (88 %) participants with ≥ 1 follow-up assessment, 123 (20 %) had a positive Chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea test result at baseline; 49 (40 %) had a <b>repeat</b> <b>infection</b> during the study period. Of those with a <b>repeat</b> <b>infection,</b> 30 (61 %) were positive at one follow-up visit, 18 (37 %) at two and 1 (2 %) at three follow-up visits.

Methods: Data collection included socio-demographic and sexual behavioural variables at first (T 0) and repeat test (T 1). Participation in retesting, prevalence and determinants of <b>repeat</b> <b>infection</b> among study participants are described and compared with findings from non-participants. Results: Of the 216 visitors enrolled in the study, 75 accepted retesting (35 %). The retest participation was 46 % (50 / 109) in the home group versus 23 % (25 / 107) in the clinic group (p = 0. 001). Men were less often retested than women (15 % versus 43 %, p < 0. 001). The overall chlamydia positivity rate at retest was 17. 3 % (13 / 75) compared to 12. 4 % seen at all visits at the STI clinic in 2011. <b>Repeated</b> <b>infections</b> were more frequent among non-Dutch than Dutch participants (27. 0 % versus 7. 9 %; p = 0. 04) and in persons reporting symptoms (31. 0 % versus 7. 0 %; p = 0. 01).

The receptor-binding domain of this protein lies within a cysteine-rich region referred to as region II (DBPII).

40|$|Severe burn injury renders {{patients}} {{susceptible to}} multiple infection episodes, however identifying specific patient groups {{at high risk}} remains challenging. Burn-induced inflammatory response dramatically modifies the levels of various cytokines. Whether these changes could predict susceptibility to infections remains unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the early changes in the pro- to anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio and investigate its ability to predict susceptibility to <b>repeated</b> <b>infections</b> after severe burn trauma. The patient population consisted of 34 adult patients having early (≤ 48 hours since injury) blood draws following severe (≥ 20 % total burn surface area (TBSA)) burn injury, and suffering from a first infection episode at least one day after blood collection. Plasma TNF-α and IL- 10 levels were measured to explore the association between the TNF-α/IL- 10 ratio, hypersusceptibility to infections, burn size (TBSA), and common severity scores (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHEII), Baux, modified Baux (R-Baux), Ryan Score, Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (ABSI)). TNF-α/IL 10 plasma ratio measured shortly after burn trauma was inversely correlated with burn size and the injury severity scores investigated, and was predictive of <b>repeated</b> <b>infections</b> (≥ 3 infection episodes) outcome (AUROC [95 %CI] of 0. 80 [0. 63 – 0. 93]). Early measures of circulating TNF-α/IL 10 ratio may be a previously unidentified biomarker associated with burn injury severity and predictive of the risk of hypersusceptibility to <b>repeated</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R

Slow, progressive, and destructive changes in the residual lung after surgery for lung cancer, known as “destroyed lung, ” are delayed nonrecurrent complications. Destroyed lung can be a difficult condition to treat due to <b>repeated</b> <b>infections</b> and is therefore a complication {{that should not be}} ignored. We had three cases of intractable pulmonary aspergillosis difficult to treat associated with destroyed lung, after lung cancer surgery. Two of these patients followed a characteristic clinical course, which started with a cystic change just below the pleura and subsequently led to respiratory failure and death due to <b>repeated</b> <b>infections.</b> The third patient followed a similar clinical course and is currently under regular follow-up. Our cases suggest that concomitant occurrence of severe complications following surgery for lung cancer, such as destroyed lung and pulmonary aspergillosis, should bemonitored because these complications can lead to respiratory failure and fatal clinical course. Radical surgery is not possible, especially when medical treatment is ineffective in controlling <b>repeated</b> <b>infections</b> and the patient’s general condition is worsened due to prolonged chronic inflammation. Therefore, aggressive surgical intervention should be considered before patients worsen. 1...|$|R
