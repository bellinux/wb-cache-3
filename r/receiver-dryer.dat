40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} to analyze performance of static mobile air conditioning (MAC) system based on compressor speed variation. Refrigerant CFC- 12 and HFC- 134 a used as working fluid. The MAC test rig has several main parts : compressor, condensor, <b>receiver-dryer,</b> thermal expansion valve (TXV), and evaporator. System is equipped with sensors to measure temperature and pressure. Test varied with compressor speed : 1000 rpm, 1200 rpm, 1500 rpm, 1800 rpm, and 2000 rpm. The result indicated that coefficient of performance (COP) decrease {{with the increase of}} compressor speed. Ideal and actual COP of CFC- 12 is higher than HFC- 134 a. Refrigerating capacity and power compression of HFC- 134 a is higher than CFC- 12. Keywords : mobile air conditioning, refrigerant, HFC- 134 a, CFC- 12, Coefficient of Performance (COP) v...|$|E
