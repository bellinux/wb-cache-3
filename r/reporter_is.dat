500|$|For this Adventure, Hergé {{decided to}} update his {{depiction}} of Tintin's clothes, having been influenced {{in doing so}} by the depiction of the character in the 1969 animated film Tintin and the Temple of the Sun. As such, in Tintin in the Picaros, the young <b>reporter</b> <b>is</b> depicted wearing a motorcycle helmet emblazoned with a CND symbol, while he also wears new flared brown trousers rather than the plus-fours that he had worn in previous instalments. Later commenting on {{the inclusion of the}} CND peace symbol, Hergé stated that for Tintin, [...] "That's normal. Tintin is a pacifist, he was always anti-war." [...] Hergé also changed the behaviour of several characters within the story, for instance by depicting Tintin practising yoga and Nestor the butler both eavesdropping and drinking Haddock's whisky. Another new development that Hergé added to the story was through revealing that Haddock's first name is Archibald for the first time.|$|E

In the miniseries, he played Jack Nash, a television reporter who battles an addiction to cocaine. The Andromeda Strain received mixed reviews, and McCormack's performance was criticized. Joanna Weiss of the Boston Globe wrote, [...] "The presence of Eric McCormack, as an intrepid TV <b>reporter,</b> <b>is</b> especially extraneous (no disrespect to intrepid reporters)." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today commented, [...] "The central cast is completed by... poor Eric McCormack as a crusading, coke-addicted journalist who spends {{the second half of the}} movie playing Rambo in the desert. Let's just say McCormack does the best he can with what he's given, and leave it at that."

She never had to grovel for an appointment." [...] Covering world leaders' speeches after World War II at the National Press Club was limited to men by a Club rule. When women were eventually allowed in to hear the speeches, they still {{were not allowed to}} ask the speakers questions, although men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work. Times reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the Club after covering one speech on assignment. Nan Robertson's article on the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said, [...] "'It will {{come as a surprise to}} you, perhaps, that the <b>reporter</b> <b>is</b> a girl, he began... asps; amazement in the ranks. 'She had used all her senses, not just her eyes, to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards. She chose a difficult subject, an offensive subject. Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you.'"

Dropped on 13 February 2013 and directed by up-and-coming visionary Nabil Elderkin (some may notice similarities to Frank Ocean's [...] "Pyramids" [...] video which he also directed). Simren Bolaria of music blog Earmilk, describes the video, [...] "A long way from his former faceless, anti-media Internet persona, a distracted Abel Tesfaye sits down for a grey and dreary television interview with a foreign journalist while a haunting hologram girl sits in bed watching from her own television set. He's under surveillance—the crew is watching, hologram girl is watching, and the <b>reporter</b> <b>is</b> talking at him, so he dips into mental absence. The Weeknd continues to slip back into his alternate stripper world where the lights are flashing, the strippers don't get tired, the décor is decadent, and he can do the watching himself, with a camcorder in hand, of course. The line between what's real and what's imagined is blurred, {{but one thing is}} clear—this video is definitely NSFW." ...|$|E

2500|$|The setting now {{switches}} to 2001. Dr. Joyce Reardon (Nancy Travis) {{is a professor}} at the fictional Beaumont University who teaches classes on psychic phenomena. Kevin Bollinger (Jimmi Simpson), a reporter for the campus newspaper, skeptically questions her about a trip she will be taking to Rose Red, an ostensibly haunted and abandoned mansion in Seattle. Professor Carl Miller (David Dukes), Joyce's departmental chair who questions the validity of Joyce's research, orders Bollinger to follow Reardon and spy on a meeting with the group of psychics she is taking to Rose Red. The group includes Victor [...] "Vic" [...] Kandinsky (Kevin Tighe), an elderly precognate with heart disease; Pam Asbury (Emily Deschanel), a young psychometric; Cathy Kramer (Judith Ivey), a middle-aged automatic writer; Nick Hardaway (Julian Sands), a telepath with remote viewing capabilities; and Emery Waterman (Matt Ross), a young post-cognate. The group meets with Steve Rimbauer (Matt Keeslar), the last descendent of Ellen (Julia Campbell) and John Rimbauer (John Procaccino), in an auditorium at the college. Bollinger takes a photo of the group joining hands in a circle, and the photo and an article ridiculing Joyce are published in the campus newspaper. Dr. Miller takes Bollinger to Rose Red and drops him off, instructing him to obtain additional embarrassing photos once the group of psychics arrives.
