5|$|Boating on {{the canal}} is encouraged, {{although}} {{the lack of}} a link to the River Parrett at Bridgwater is restrictive. At this point, the Parrett is a salt water river, and is laden with silt, whereas the canal contains fresh water. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate the fresh, as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for the population of Bridgwater. The canal forms part of the local flood <b>relief</b> <b>system,</b> in winter taking water from the River Tone at Taunton and discharging it into the Parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of Bridgwater, near the Bridgwater Canalside Centre.|$|E
5|$|Famines became {{common in}} {{northern}} China {{in the early}} 17th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event {{now known as the}} Little Ice Age. Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining <b>relief</b> <b>system,</b> and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility. The central government, starved of resources, could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities. Making matters worse, a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan, killing an unknown but large number of people. The deadliest earthquake of all time, the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556, occurred during the Jiajing Emperor's reign, killing approximately 830,000 people.|$|E
5|$|One {{result of}} these changes were the Highland Clearances, by which much of the {{population}} of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the UK, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia. Many that remained were now crofters, living on very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals. For these families kelping, fishing, spinning of linen and military service became important sources of additional revenue. Scotland suffered its last major subsistence crisis, when the potato blight that caused the Irish potato famine reached the Highlands in 1846. Some 150,000 people whose food supply was mainly potatoes faced disaster. They were rescued by an effective emergency <b>relief</b> <b>system</b> that stands in contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland, but the danger of starvation remained into the 1850s.|$|E

50|$|Formed in 1977, the Design Institute for Emergency <b>Relief</b> <b>Systems</b> was a {{consortium}} of 29 companies {{under the auspices of}} the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) that developed methods for the design of emergency <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> to handle runaway reactions. Its purpose was to develop the technology and methods needed for sizing pressure <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> for chemical reactors, particularly those in which exothermic reactions are carried out. Such reactions include many classes of industrially important processes including polymerizations, nitrations, diazotizations, sulphonations, epoxidations, aminations, esterifications, neutralizations and many others. Pressure <b>relief</b> <b>systems</b> can be difficult to design, not least because what is expelled can be gas/vapour, liquid, or a mixture of the two - just as with a can of carbonated drink when it is suddenly opened. For chemical reactions, it requires extensive knowledge of both chemical reaction hazards and fluid flow.|$|R
5|$|The {{agricultural}} revolution {{changed the}} traditional system of agriculture which had existed in Lowland Scotland. Thousands of cottars and tenant farmers migrated from farms and smallholdings {{to the new}} industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh and northern England. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), Highland landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society. Whereas rents had often been paid in kind, the landlords turned to money rents. They displaced farmers to raise sheep and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in the mid-nineteenth century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production. One result of these changes was the Highland Clearances, by which much of the population of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the United Kingdom, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, and further afield to England, Canada, America and Australia. The potato famine of the 1840s, caused by potato blight, which devastated the population of Ireland, reached the Highlands in 1846. Although 150,000 people faced disaster, because their food supply was largely potatoes (with a little herring, oatmeal and milk), they were rescued by an effective emergency <b>relief</b> <b>system</b> that stands in dramatic contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland and prevented a major demographic crisis.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{these changes}} the {{highlands}} remained very poor and traditional, with few {{connections to the}} uplift of the Scottish Enlightenment and little role in the Industrial Revolution. A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of Argyll, Atholl, Buccleuch, and Sutherland, owned the best lands and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society, and had less need of soldiers.

This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in mid-century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production. The Irish potato famine of the 1840s was caused by a plant disease that reached the Highlands in 1846, where 150,000 people faced disaster because their food supply was largely potatoes (with a little herring, oatmeal and milk).

30|$|Considering the {{hydrological}} {{boundary conditions}} the flood <b>relief</b> <b>system’s</b> capacity {{was set to}} approx. 9  m 3 /s. This value includes safety margins and refers to the plant’s design storage level of 15  m which was defined in accordance to local geological characteristics (see “Determination of the hydraulic head”). As it later became apparent (rainy season 2011 / 2012), however, peak discharge values distinctly above 10  m 3 /s occurred as well as ongoing high discharge values exceeding the flood <b>relief</b> <b>system’s</b> capacity for days. In total this lead to extreme storage levels, which are especially critical in terms of seepage in spatial proximity to the barrage (see “Initial operational phase”). Fortunately they did not cause any damage to the plant or the surrounding geology. Although fragmentary discharge data of the past decades do not allow a statistical classification of this event, investigations of KIT showed the necessity of extending the flood <b>relief</b> <b>system’s</b> discharge capacity. Even though {{it is assumed that}} the observed event will only occur sporadically in the future, the flood <b>relief</b> <b>system’s</b> discharge capacity was extended to approx. 11.5  m 3 /s (also referring to the plant’s design storage level of 15 m).|$|R

2500|$|The Stellungsdivisionen held {{sectors that}} were too wide for swift replacement, because of the tempo of British attacks and the Eingreif {{divisions}} [...] must begin to swap places to enable frequent reliefs, which would limit the exhaustion of the infantry {{and make sure that}} the troops defending an area were familiar with the ground. The <b>relief</b> <b>system</b> could only apply only to infantry and engineers, because the artillery had been divided into two thirds in emplacements and one third kept mobile in support of counter-attacks. Armin ordered that the new tactics were to apply to Gruppe Staden, Gruppe Ypres and the right flank division of Gruppe Wijtschate. Divisional reliefs should be accomplished in one night; Eingreif divisions were to keep a third of their troops close to the front and the rest in reserve, only to advance to the battlefront after a British attack had started. If the Eingreif troops were needed, then at the minimum, the battalions engaged were to be relieved by fresh troops. The new Vorfeld defence system was to be explained in detail to the troops before they were sent into action. Armin concluded with a warning that more troops were straggling to the rear and that a cordon should be used to prevent soldiers without written authority moving beyond. Punishments for abandoning posts were to be inflicted and announced to the troops.|$|E
