40|$|We {{have been}} {{developing}} a state-of-the-art tool {{to estimate the}} atmospheric path delays by raytracing through mesoscale analysis (MANAL) data, which is operationally used for numerical weather prediction by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The tools, which we have named KAshima RAytracing Tools (KARAT) ', are capable of calculating total slant delays and <b>ray-bending</b> angles considering real atmospheric phenomena. The KARAT can estimate atmospheric slant delays by an analytical 2 -D ray-propagation model by Thayer and a 3 -D Eikonal solver. We compared PPP solutions using KARAT with that using the Global Mapping Function (GMF) and Vienna Mapping Function 1 (VMF 1) for GPS sites of the GEONET (GPS Earth Observation Network System) operated by Geographical Survey Institute (GSI). In our comparison 57 stations of GEONET during the year of 2008 were processed. The KARAT solutions are slightly better than the solutions using VMF 1 and GMF with linear gradient model for horizontal and height positions. Our results imply that KARAT is {{a useful tool for}} an efficient reduction of atmospheric path delays in radio-based space geodetic techniques such as GNSS and VLBI...|$|E
40|$|Recent Chandra and XMM-Newton {{observations}} {{of a number}} of X-ray ``dim'' pulsating neutron stars revealed quite unexpected features in the emission from these sources. Their soft thermal spectrum, believed to originate directly from the star surface, shows evidence for a phase-varying absorption line at some hundred eVs. The pulse modulation is relatively large (pulsed fractions in the range ~ 12 %- 35 %), the pulse shape is often non-sinusoidal, and the hard X-ray color appears to be anti-correlated in phase with the total emission. Moreover, the prototype of this class, RX J 0720. 4 - 3125, has been found to undergo rather sensible changes both in its spectral and timing properties over a timescale of a few years. All these new findings seem difficult to reconcile with the standard picture of a cooling neutron star endowed with a purely dipolar magnetic field, at least if surface emission is produced in an atmosphere on top of the crust. In this paper we explore how a dipolar+quadrupolar star-centered field influence the properties of the observed lightcurves. The phase-resolved spectrum has been evaluated accounting for both radiative transfer in a magnetized atmosphere and general relativistic <b>ray-bending.</b> We computed over 78000 lightcurves varying the quadrupolar components and the viewing geometry. A comparison of the data with our model indicate that higher order multipoles are required to reproduce the observations. Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{project was}} to develop a method for {{implicit}} structural inversion of geophysical data, using a gridded model. With the term structural inversion we mean an inversion to obtain an image of the (gridded) sub-surface, which can directly be interpreted in terms of sharp boundaries between different lithologies. Implicit indicates that we neither assume a fixed number of anomalies, nor enforce a fixed structure explicitly. We model the sub-surface with a grid of homogeneous, rectangular prisms. The values of the physical property of these cells are the parameters inverted for. The structures in the model should be apparent from large contrasts in parameter values between neighboring cells. We developed a method for such an implicit structural inversion, using Linear Programming (LP). All the models investigated comprised of two lithologies, with one or more homogeneous anomalous regions embedded within a homogeneous background. The contrast between rock properties is used a constraint on the parameters. Ideally each cell will ultimately be identifiable as belonging to one of the lithologies. This LP-based method (using the L 1 -norm data misfit) was tested on synthetic gravity data and was able to reconstruct important features of the test models. The results compared favorably with a traditional inversion using Truncated Singular Values. This method does have the limitation that the minimum depth to the top needs to be known a priori. This method was then extended to simultaneously invert for both a linear trend in the data and for the density contrasts of the cells. The method was used to invert a field gravity data set. The results are in agreement with the ones obtained by the industry using detailed forward modeling. The same LP-based method was applied to invert synthetic seismic cross-well first arrival travel-times for the absolute inter-well slowness distribution. This is a non-linear problem due to <b>ray-bending</b> in a heterogeneous medium. For a simple sub-surface model, the implicit structural inversion using the true rays, or using the iterative scheme, both produced very good models of the sub-surface. However, a regularisation parameter needs to be chosen properly. A more complicated model with poor ray-coverage, was difficult to retrieve using only seismic data, however, a joint inversion of seismic data (using the true rays) together with gravity data gave encouraging results. Another method, this time using the L 2 -norm of the data misfit, was developed in parallel. In an iterative scheme, a reference model was constructed, using information regarding the density contrasts, which the inversion result should resemble. The method needs 5 tuning constants; when proper (wide) ranges are supplied, a parameter search for the constants, yields their optimal values to be used for the inversion. This search can be steered using the resulting data misfits. One of the tuning parameter is dynamically increased during the iterations to ensure a result with clear structure. Experiments on synthetic gravity data gave good inversion results, even when the top of the anomaly was unknown...|$|E
