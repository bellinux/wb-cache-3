5|$|Tension {{had been}} {{building}} among the base's staff in <b>recent</b> <b>days,</b> and most suspected that an attack would come {{against one of the}} border stations in the near future. Ample evidence of the coming attack was discovered by British patrols, but signs of enemy troop movements were disregarded and newly cleared positions were mistaken for ambush sites. Thus the base was continually left with the bare minimum number of men as the majority that could be spared went out on patrol. As a result of these conditions, only 36 men were present in the base {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 April 1965 when it came under ferocious attack by 150 to 400 Indonesian troops, supported by artillery and rocket fire. Immediately, the Indonesians swarmed into one segment of the trenches and destroyed one of the two mortars.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The main aim of the United Kingdom Day Visits Survey, the Great Britain Day Visits Survey (GBDVS), and latterly the England Leisure Visits Survey (ELVS), is to measure the extent of participation in day visits, and to estimate the scale and value of visits taken. In particular the principal investigators {{are interested in the}} extent of participation in different kinds of day trips, how frequently particular types of trip are undertaken, and associated expenditure. The survey also seeks to provide information on a number of other trip details, such as activities undertaken, areas visited, time spent at the main destination, modes of transport, distance travelled, number of people involved and the trip party composition. Respondents to the survey are generally asked to recall trips taken within the past two weeks. The 1994 survey covered three main types of trip : home-based trips - trips made from home for leisure activities, which start and finish on the same day (i. e. do not include an overnight stay); visits made from home on business - day trips for business purposes for special or one-off purposes such as attending a conference for the day; holiday-based trips - day trips made from a holiday base in the UK, taken while staying away from home. Main Topics : The following information is included: record of all day trips from home in the last two weeks; record of all day trips from holiday base in the last two weeks; details of up to 7 most <b>recent</b> <b>day</b> trips from home in the last two weeks; details of up to 7 most <b>recent</b> <b>day</b> trips from holiday base in the last two weeks; details of up to 7 most <b>recent</b> <b>day</b> trips for business purposes in the last two weeks; details of <b>recent</b> <b>day</b> trips in the last 12 months to a town, seaside, countryside, wood, or river.
