But what testicular cancer taught me is that the NHS will probably let you down if you need screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you".

2500|$|In 2008, Brooks {{returned}} to EastEnders for a guest stint. She was later confirmed {{to be coming}} back as a regular character. She said, [...] "I had doubts to begin with, mainly because of Kiki, as I know how full-on EastEnders can be, and then there's that stigma {{about going back to}} a soap. But I'm so pleased I did, it was the right decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel <b>really</b> <b>lucky</b> to have a job and I need the security because of Kiki. I was just going to go back for a year, but I had a meeting with the boss last week and we're going to go for another year. So lots more time to get up to much mischief". Executive producer Diederick Santer said, [...] "I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining EastEnders. With her appearances last month, she reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine". She temporarily departed in September 2012, and returned in April 2013 before departing again in March 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{factor in}} the change of the band's sound was due to Wilson's meeting of Israeli rock singer Aviv Geffen. The two met when Geffen, a fan of Wilson's music, invited Porcupine Tree on a tour in 2000 {{in support of the}} band's {{previous}} album, Lightbulb Sun. Touring together lead to a separate musical collaboration named Blackfield. Geffen, not being a fan of metal music, kept that project in more of a pop rock genre, sounding more like prior Porcupine Tree albums Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun. This gave Wilson an outlet for that side of his music, allowing him to concentrate on more metal sounds with Porcupine Tree without abandoning the prior genre altogether either. Rounding out the changes was the departure of drummer Chris Maitland, with the replacement being Gavin Harrison, who joined in early 2002. Maitland was unable to make a larger commitment with being signed to a major record label, and the band found Harrison's style more fitting to a more metal-sounding album. Wilson summarized the band's changes at the time as: In Absentia was all written before Gavin came on; even the drum parts were kind of programmed. But it’s one of those times sometimes in life when everything comes together. I’d written these songs and I was very much more interested at that time—having worked with Opeth—in the idea of combining a more kind of brutal or metal aspect back again into the fabric of the music. At the same time Gavin came along and Gavin was a very different drummer to our previous drummer, Chris Maitland. He was much more of a powerhouse and he was much more technical. He had more of a contemporary edge to his sound so {{it was just one of}} those <b>really</b> <b>lucky</b> things that he just came in and he played those songs and just blew everyone away and everything just kind of came together. And of course it was the first record we made for our new label and we got signed to a big American label for the first time [...] Gavin was the final piece of that equation in a way—he just totally raised the bar in terms of not just the drumming but just the musicianship right throughout the band. Everyone was listening to Gavin and saying, “Fuck, wow. We really need to step up our game.” ...|$|E

Before that it belonged to Howard Rockerduck (the father of John D. Rockerduck). The customer who paid it to him, a ditch-digger called Burt, seemingly [...] "cheated" [...] Scrooge. In reality, Scrooge's father, Fergus McDuck, gave Burt the dime specifically for paying Scrooge for his services. Scrooge McDuck never learned that fact, although Fergus did reveal it to Scrooge's sisters Matilda and Hortense. Burt and Magica De Spell, who learned about this when she traveled in time to the day Scrooge earned the Dime, are the only other ones who know. McDuck kept it as a reminder not to be fooled again in the future. When he emigrated to the US three years later, he carried it with him. Scrooge still has the dime and keeps it on a pillow under glass because of its sentimental value.

After Luke and Laura talk privately, he announces that his engagement to Tracy is off. Secretly, Luke and Laura admit that they could never truly be together again, but because of a family crisis, they must pretend to be. It appears that Lucky has been kidnapped and when they arrive in Canada, they encounter Luke's old fiancee, Jennifer Smith, who demands one night with Luke in exchange for Lucky. However, she doesn't <b>really</b> have <b>Lucky</b> and because of the amount of wine both consumed, they don't spend the night together. Next, they encounter a gun-wielding Holly Sutton who informs them that now Ethan is missing. The kidnappers send them a picture of a tied up and gagged Lucky and Ethan. Through the photo, Luke, Laura and Holly discover clues thanks to Lucky and Ethan and it leads them to their location. This leads them to another old enemy of Luke's, the still very much alive Frank Smith, now paralyzed as a result of Luke's gun battle with him 22 years before. Frank demands the life of Laura, knowing that this would leave the already emotionally fragile Luke a broken man. But at the last moment, Lucky storms in, and with a blast of gunfire, Frank Smith's guards are dead. Luke pumps Frank full of lead, this time sending the aging mobster to his death for sure. Lucky informs them that he had to play along with Frank Smith in order to save his son Jake. When Luke and Laura discover that Helena wants to see Luke, Luke goes alone and learns a shocking truth, that their grandson Jake (whom Luke believed he had run over in his car while drunk) is very much alive. Meanwhile, Dillon Quartermaine (Robert Palmer Watkins) returns to Port Charles after having followed Luke and Laura, having discovered that Luke is still in love with Tracy and that his reconciliation with Laura was only to save their son.|$|R

We had a mail call while we were there, an AT- 7 flew down from Craig with a load. I’m sending you a letter we got from your mother. Tell her hello for me, and send her my love, she’s very sweet. I also {{got a letter from}} you written Thursday night. It didn’t sound like you honey, it was very disgusted and very bitter and I’m sorry. But darling it can’t be helped. The Army is running our lives and there’s {{nothing we can do about}} it. Keep that beautiful chin of yours up baby, don’t let it get you down, it’s much harder that way. Darling I’m making this promise to you that every minute, every second that we can be together we will be. We can’t afford to spend a second of our time thinking about the past of the future. What’s important is that we will have that time and we’ve got to pack into it a lifetime of laughs, of wonderful moments, and maybe a few sorrows. And if you think I’m going to live on the post you’re nuts, and if the Army thins so its nuts too. You bet I’m going to live with you darling, the Army or anyone isn’t strong enough to stop me. Honey we really have no right to complain, we’re <b>really</b> very <b>lucky,</b> there are many other couples who haven’t had the happiness that we are going to, and will never be able to. Darling we should thank God that we will have all those wonderful months together. We have had some tough weeks but we can’t be bitter about it. If we let that happen we’ll start blaming each other, and that’s the quickest way of breaking up a marriage. I can’t help what the Army does with me darling, from the job they’re doing over there I guess they know what they’re doing. All fighter pilots have to go through this and I’m glad to be getting it over with. It would be even tougher later wouldn’t it darling? So keep smilin’ baby, and I’ll see you Saturday. Yes, Saturday, I was going to surprise you but I guess you need some cheering up (conceited ain’t I?). If you feel a tenth as bad as I do darling, you sure must. It’s so damned lonesome around here anyway and being separated from you makes it so God damned much worse. Please darling tell me that you’re happy, because when you aren’t, I’m not. Remember honey, the most important thing in the world to me is you. I love you darling, I feel I should make some attempt to tell you how much, but I can’t. It’s as hard to grasp and as large as the infinity of the universe angel, and even Einstein can’t explain that, so how could I ever begin to. All I can tell you is I love you, I love you, again and again, and if I kept on from now ‘til doom’s day, and every “I love you” was materially a part of my love for you, I’d not have enough time darling. The time will pass honey. It will be the longest week of my life, but believe it or not science has proved that time waits for no one. I guess we’ve come the closest to disproving it though. Just think of the time we’ll have together, - it helps. And I will be able to live off the Post darling. It’s not exactly legal but what the Army doesn’t know won’t hurt it. I love you angel, I love you with all my heart. You have all my love all my life, my darling wife, and until Saturday honey, I remain, as always, Your devoted husband Judd P. S. – It’s the moments apart that make the moments together so much more enjoyable. [Translation ends...|$|R
