PURPA required that electric utilities must interconnect with <b>renewable</b> <b>power</b> <b>production</b> facilities.

5000|$|SWITCH is a {{power system}} model, focused on {{renewables}} integration. It can identify which generator and transmission projects to build {{in order to satisfy}} electricity demand at the lowest cost over a several year period while also reducing [...] emissions. SWITCH utilizes multi-stage stochastic linear optimization with the objective of minimizing the present value of the cost of power plants, transmission capacity, fuel usage, and an arbitrary per-tonne [...] charge (to represent either a carbon tax or a certificate price), {{over the course of a}} multi-year investment period. It has two major sets of decision variables. First, at the start of each investment period, SWITCH selects how much generation capacity to build in each of several geographic load zones, how much power transfer capability to add between these zones, and whether to operate existing generation capacity during the investment period or to temporarily mothball it to avoid fixed operation and maintenance costs. Second, for a set of sample days within each investment period, SWITCH makes hourly decisions about how much power to generate from each dispatchable power plant, store at each pumped hydro facility, or transfer along each transmission interconnector. The system must also ensure enough generation and transmission capacity to provide a planning reserve margin of 15% above the load forecasts. For each sampled hour, SWITCH uses electricity demand and <b>renewable</b> <b>power</b> <b>production</b> based on actual measurements, so that the weather-driven correlations between these elements remain intact.|$|E

The compromise between {{the stability of}} a hybrid electric grid (HEG) and the total operating cost {{can be reached by}} accurately anticipating the future <b>renewable</b> <b>power</b> <b>productions.</b> This thesis suggests the use of weather forecasts to establish day-ahead operating schedules for a grid that include the operating plan of dispatchable fuel-based generators, the charge or discharge of energy storage units, and the energy to exchange with the commercial grid if the configuration of the HEG allows it. The weather forecasts used as a key factor to establish the optimal plan are subject to uncertainty. In order to mitigate this problem, multiple weather forecast scenarios are used in the optimization. This thesis alters the optimization model to represent various configurations of the HEG and optimizes over a variety of weather forecasts. It then tests the operating plans suggested by the model using particular weather scenarios representing actual observed weather conditions. Finally, this thesis gives an illustration of how to run the optimization model with the rolling horizon method using updates of weather forecasts. Lieutenant, Tunisian Nav...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Now a {{days the}} {{requirement}} for <b>renewable</b> energy <b>power</b> <b>production</b> is increasing due to scarcity of conventional energy resources. So, {{one of the best}} renewable energy resource for production of electrical energy is wind. As most of the loads are lagging loads, losses will be more due to low power factor. In our study even though capacitor bank is connected to compensate reactive power, and to maintain voltage stability, it is observed that there is no constant required power factor at all loads. Due to connection of capacitor in steps using capacitor bank, there is over compensation. In this paper “Thyristor switched Capacitor”is proposed to improve power factor in windmill power plant.

40|$|Abstract. With {{increasing}} {{the contribution of}} <b>renewable</b> energies in <b>power</b> <b>production,</b> the task of reducing dynamic instability in power grids must also be addressed from the generation side, because the power delivered from such sources is spatiotemporally stochastic in na-ture. Here we characterize the stochastic properties {{of the wind and}} solar energy sources by studying their spectrum and multifractal expo-nents. The computed power spectrum from high frequency time series of solar irradiance and wind power reveals a power-law behaviour with an exponent ∼ 5 / 3 (Kolmogorov exponent) for the frequency domain 0. 001 Hz < f < 0. 05 Hz, which means that the power grid is being fed by turbulent-like sources. Our results bring important evidence on the stochastic and turbulent-like behaviour of <b>renewable</b> <b>power</b> produc-tion from wind and solar energies, which can cause instability in power grids. Our statistical analysis also provides important information that must be used as a guideline for an optimal design of power grids that operate under intermittent <b>renewable</b> sources of <b>power.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} minimizing {{the difference in the}} demand and the supply of power using microgrids. We setup multiple microgrids, that provide electricity to a village.

During each time period, these microgrids need to take decision on the amount of <b>renewable</b> <b>power</b> to be used from the batteries as well as the amount of power needed from the main grid. We formulate this problem in the framework of Markov Decision Process (MDP), similar to the one discussed in [1]. The power allotment to the village from the main grid is fixed and bounded, whereas the renewable energy generation is uncertain in nature. Therefore we adapt a distributed version of the popular Reinforcement learning technique, Multi-Agent Q-Learning to the problem. Finally, we also consider a variant of this problem where the cost of <b>power</b> <b>production</b> at the main site is taken into consideration. In this scenario the microgrids need to minimize the demand-supply deficit, while maintaining the desired average cost of the <b>power</b> <b>production...</b>|$|R
40|$|European {{energy markets}} have undergone, and will {{continue}} to undergo, large changes in coming years, as the share of <b>renewable</b> energy <b>power</b> <b>production</b> increases and markets become more interconnected. We analyze the fundamental drivers behind electricity spot prices in Nord Pool and the German European Power Exchange (EPEX), and compare the price formation dynamics in these two markets. The comparison is motivated by the NordLink cable which will connect Germany and Norway in 2020. It will exploit the different market characteristics, and is expected to reduce the price spread and improve utilization of renewable energy sources. Our thesis increases the understanding of the market mechanisms, which is required by market participants in order to adapt to the future changes. A linear quantile regression is used to estimate quantiles spanning the entire price distribution. Separate regression models are estimated for each trading period to capture highly varying intraday properties of the electricity prices. We examine the price formation dynamics across the entire distribution, and how it differs between Nord Pool and EPEX. The results show that the fundamental variables impact the two markets differently and non-linearly throughout the trading day. Autoregressive effects are most influential in Nord Pool, together with demand and supply in the highest quantile. Overall, most variables have a low price impact; this is likely due to the large amount of flexible and stable hydro power which cancels out fluctuations in other parameters. EPEX has a higher number of important price drivers across the price distribution. Demand is the primary price determinant, while fossil fuel prices, autoregressive effects, and wind <b>power</b> <b>production</b> also notably impact the price formation. The energy mix characteristics are the likely reason for these differences, as EPEX is much more inflexible due to large-scale thermal production and intermittent renewable energy. Clearly, market participants can utilize the different characteristics and mutually benefit from the upcoming connection...|$|R

40|$|A major {{challenge}} for power grids {{with a high}} share of renewable energy systems (RES), such as island grids, is to provide frequency stability {{in the face of}} renewable fluctuations. In this work we evaluate the ability of electric vehicles (EV) to provide distributed primary control and to eliminate frequency peaks. To do so we for the first time explicitly model the network structure and incorporate non-Gaussian, strongly intermittent fluctuations typical for RES. We show that EVs can completely eliminate frequency peaks. Using threshold randomization we further demonstrate that demand synchronization effects and battery stresses can be greatly reduced. In contrast, explicit frequency averaging has a strong destabilizing effect, suggesting that the role of delays in distributed control schemes requires further studies. Overall we find that distributed control outperforms central one. The results are robust against a further increase in <b>renewable</b> <b>power</b> <b>production</b> and fluctuations...|$|E

With the current state-of-the art PRO membranes, we estimate the minimum levelized cost of electricity for PRO of US$ 1. 2 /kWh for seawater and river water pairing, $ 0. 44 /kWh for reverse osmosis brine and wastewater, and $ 0. 066 /kWh for nearly saturated water (26 % wt) and river water, all for a 2 MW production system. Only a pairing of extremely high salinity (greater than 18 %) water and freshwater {{has the potential to}} compete with wind power currently at $ 0. 074 /kWh.
