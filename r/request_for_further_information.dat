40|$|Information {{retrieval}} (IR) based bug localization approaches {{process a}} textual bug report {{and a collection}} of source code files to find buggy files. They output a ranked list of files sorted by their likelihood to contain the bug. Recently, several IR-based bug localization tools have been proposed. However, there are no perfect tools that can successfully localize faults within a few number of most suspicious program elements for every single input bug report. Therefore, it is difficult for developers to decide which tool would be effective for a given bug report. Furthermore, for some bug reports, no bug localization tools would be useful. Even a state-of-the-art bug localization tool outputs many ranked lists where buggy files appear very low in the lists. This potentially causes developers to distrust bug localization tools. In this work, we build an oracle that can automatically predict whether a ranked list produced by an IR-based bug localization tool is likely to be effective or not. We consider a ranked list to be effective if a buggy file appears in the top-N position of the list. If a ranked list is unlikely to be effective, developers do not need to waste time in checking the recommended files one by one.

Inspections for building work can also be carried out by a local council building certifier, but many councils now permit owners and builders to employ their own private certifiers. The building certifier inspects the project during progress of the work and can give directions, issue permits, notices and orders as required ensuring compliance.

50|$|Cultural {{variation}} {{can be seen}} by {{the extent}} of information learned or absorbed by children in non-Western cultures through learning by observation. Cultural variation is not restricted only to ethnicity and nationality, but rather, extends to the specific practices within communities. In learning by observation, children use observation to learn without verbal <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>further</b> <b>information,</b> or without direct instruction. For example, children from Mexican heritage families tend to learn and make better use of information observed during classroom demonstration then children of European heritage. Children of European heritage experience the type of learning that separates them from their family and community activities. They instead participate in lessons and other exercises in special settings such as school. Cultural backgrounds differ from each other in which children display certain characteristics in regards to learning an activity. Another example is seen in the immersion of children in some Indigenous communities of the Americas into the adult world and the effects it has on observational learning and the ability to complete multiple tasks simultaneously. This might be due to children in these communities having the opportunity to see a task being completed by their elders or peers and then trying to emulate the task. In doing so they learn to value observation and the skill-building it affords them because of the value it holds within their community. This type of observation is not passive, but reflects the child's intent to participate or learn within a community.|$|R
