5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E
5|$|The Vishnudharmottara Purana {{describes}} {{the iconography of}} Vishnu. While the lotus and shankha are held in the upper hands, the lower hands rest on two dwarf figures: the personified gada and chakra. The gada personified as a slim-waisted woman, holds a chamara (chowry) {{in her hands and}} is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> head; chakra stands as a man on Vishnu's left. The personified weapons known as Ayudhapurusha emerge in Gupta era (320–550 CE) sculptures. The personified Kaumodaki is also known as Gada-devi (the suffix devi means goddess) or Gada-nari ("gada-woman"). Since the Sanskrit word gada is feminine, gada is regarded as a woman. A Gupta Vishnu in Udayagiri Caves depicts Vishnu accompanied by Gadadevi and the personified chakra. Gadadevi often appears in Vishnu images from Kashmir, including Vishnu's four-headed form Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. She holds a chamara and looks in adoration towards her master, whose hand rests on her head. She wears a crown or has an elaborate hairstyle. Apart from a lower garment, she might wear a blouse or have a bare torso. She is depicted emerging from the gada.|$|E
5|$|Treatises {{such as the}} Vishnudharmottara Purana {{and various}} Agamas {{describe}} the iconography of the ayudhapurushas. Shakti is depicted as a red-hued woman seated on a wolf. The Danda is a fearful black-complexioned man with wrathful red eyes. The Khadga is also a dark and angry man. Pasha is depicted as a male snake with seven hoods. Dhvaja ("banner") is a yellow-coloured strong man with his mouth wide open. The Trishula is a handsome black-complexioned man with lovely eyebrows. The Shankha {{is described as a}} white male with adorable eyes. The Bana (arrow) is a red-coloured man with beautiful eyes, however the Vaikhaashagama describes it to be a black-complexioned eunuch with three eyes, dressed in white clothes and riding on the wind. The Dhanus (bow) is a red lotus coloured female with a stringed bow on her head. The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes Chakra as man with a fat belly and round eyes, decorated with various ornaments and holding a chamara (chowry) and with Vishnu's left hand on his head. The slim-waisted woman Gada holds a chowry in her hands and is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|E

500|$|At 31cm × 14cm, the painting's {{dimensions}} are {{small enough to}} be almost considered miniature, consistent with most 15th-century devotional diptychs. A reduced size increased portability and affordability, and encouraged the viewer to approach the piece to more closely see its intricate details. [...] The work shows Mary wearing a dark blue robe – the colour traditionally used to emphasise her humanity – over a red dress of different textured fabrics. Her hem is embroidered in gold with gilded lettering that reads [...] "SOL" [...] and [...] "LU", or perhaps SIOR SOLE HEC ES, in all probability, fragments of the Latin words for [...] "sun" [...] (sole) and [...] "light" [...] (lux). On her head is an elaborately tiered and jeweled crown and in her arms she carries the infant Jesus, his feet <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> left hand.

[...] "Breakaway" [...] was {{also included in the}} setlist of Clarkson's 2009 All I Ever Wanted Tour where she performed the song in Hammerstein Ballroom without any dancers, acrobatics, moving set pieces and no special effects. Caryn Ganz noted that Clarkson belted the ballad song effortlessly by walking {{back and forth across the}} stage with her right hand on the mic and her left <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> chest. Jim Cantiello of MTV opined that Clarkson's [...] "low chest-voice cooed the verses of 'Breakaway and complimented the singer's vocal prowess throughout the concert. On April 3, 2012, Clarkson performed [...] "Breakaway" [...] as an encore to her Stronger Tour at Nokia Theatre L.A.

[...] Fannia are drawn to feces and urine, and their presence is strong evidence of neglect. The woman probably had not changed clothes or bathed in some time. [...] She had developed pressure spots where her head had been <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> chest for long periods of time. [...] If she had been taken care of, the caregiver would have noticed these wounds.|$|E
