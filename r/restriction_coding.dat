40|$|Abstract — Almost every {{software}} system must include a security module to authenticate users and to authorize what {{elements of the}} system can be accessed by each user. This paper describes a security model called “CincoSecurity ” that follows the Role Based Access Control model (RBAC), but implementing fine-grained roles that can be grouped into “security profiles”. This leads to a great flexibility to configure the security of an application by selecting the operations allowed to each security profile, and later, by registering the users in one or several of these profiles. We describe also a security software module (that implements the CincoSecurity model) that we propose to be the initial code baseline {{for the development of}} any Use Cases oriented Java EE system, offering from the beginning a flexible, extensible and administrable access control to the elements of the application that is to be developed. Moreover, CincoSecurity allows automating the generation of the additional code required to protect the use cases and its elements of the Java EE application being developed, with tools that add the required security <b>restriction</b> <b>code</b> accordingly with the proposed security model...|$|R

40|$|The Uplink Synchronous Transmission Scheme [1], is a {{technique}} used by operators, that exploit the uplink orthogonality, to reduce multiple access interferences in uplink direction and consequently to increase uplink capacity. The USTS gives better performances when we have an ideal case presented by no channelization <b>code</b> <b>restrictions</b> per scrambling <b>code.</b> In reality, channelization codes are limited. To resolve this problem, several scrambling codes are used to admit more users in the cell. However, the use of different scrambling codes increases the multiple access interference and consequently decreases uplink capacity gain, since signals transmitted by users under different scrambling codes are non-orthogonal. To obtain more performances and therefore to increase the uplink capacity gain, we will study {{the introduction of a}} multiuser detector for interferences cancellation, in uplink synchronous mode. For that, two values of interference cancellation efficiency  of the multi-user detector are considered. In this study, only the multiple access interference is reduced. To show the effect of other-cell interferences on uplink synchronous mode capacity, two scenarios are considered: an isolated cell and a multiple cell networ...|$|R

40|$|Traditional code {{design for}} fading {{channels}} assumes that interleaving {{is able to}} make the fading on all received symbols independent. However, the ideal interleaving depth depends on vehicle speed via the Doppler rate. If the vehicle stops, infinite interleaving depth would be required. Transmitter diversity may be used to achieve independent fading without interleaving, even in the presence of zero Doppler. Even so, not all of the fading samples are uncorrelated, and this {{must be taken into account}} in code design or the desired diversity might not be achieved. In this work convolutional trellis codes are presented which utilize the full diversity capability of the system. ^ A multichannel signaling model is presented which can accommodate transmitter diversity in addition to time diversity, receiver antenna diversity, and frequency diversity. The exact pairwise error event probability for frequency non-selective Rayleigh fading channels is derived for this model. At high signal-to-noise ratio a tight upper bound is derived. ^ Examination of the error bound shows that the most important design metrics for transmitter diversity on Rayleigh fading channels are the minimum (1) effective Hamming distance (eH) and (2) effective product distance (eP). It is shown that for independent fading with one level of transmitter diversity these metrics are equivalent to the traditional Hamming and product distances. ^ Useful properties of the design metrics are proven. It is shown how to compute eH and eP recursively. This allows efficient algorithms such as the Viterbi algorithm to be employed for code analysis. It is proven that under certain <b>restrictions,</b> <b>codes</b> which are geometrically uniform with respect to eP can only achieve one level of diversity. Other techniques to obtain space-time codes with a uniform distance spectrum are investigated. ^ Design rules are presented which guarantee full diversity codes for any desired diversity level and throughput. Numerous codes are presented. ...|$|R
