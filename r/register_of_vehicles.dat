The plates are inscribed with a 3-letter and 3-number combination (similar to those used in the Argentine Republic), and remain with the vehicle for its lifetime.The series [...] "Axx nnn" [...] and [...] "Bxx nnn" [...] have been used mainly by the central office of the Registro in Asunción, series beginning with other letters have been used by regional offices in the interior of the country. [...] "Exx nnn" [...] is reserved for public vehicles which are tax-exempt, the serie [...] "Txx nnn" [...] is for agricultural tractors and machinery, the serie [...] "Vxx nnn" [...] for antique cars (and [...] "VAP nnn" [...] for those belonging to members of the Circulo de Vehiculos Antiguos del Paraguay). There are also plates inscribed in black for persons whose occupation or elective position gives them immunity from prosecution, like the [...] "SEN xxx" [...] plates of Senators, [...] "DIP xxx" [...] of Representatives (Diputados), [...] "JMx nnn" [...] for elected municipal council members (Junta Municipal) authorities, and the [...] "PJx nnn" [...] plates indicates official vehicles of judges.|$|E

40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of public transport on {{example of the}} Pardubice Region Abstract This diploma thesis {{is devoted to the}} {{competitiveness of}} public transport in the municipalities of the Pardubice Region. Competitiveness is understood mainly in terms of the price difference between travel time and cost of public and individual car transport, and also in terms of the real demand in the municipalities, thus the share of commuting by public transport. Other parameters of mode choice, that is understood as the main indicator of competitiveness, is the number of public transport lines and automobilization. The main objective of this work is to determine how public transportation depends on the other transport characteristics of municipalities. To select significant variables, multiple linear regression analysis was used. After that, geographically weighted regression was applied in order to explain the share of commuting from municipalities. Most data originate in public databases (The <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> of Department of Transport, population census, digital geographic databases ArcČR and CEDA) and web portals (OREDO, IDOS), part of the data was obtained within questionnaire survey in selected municipalities. An expected negative relationship between the degree of automobilization and the number of public [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{second part}} of a {{research}} proposal into the relationship between general periodic vehicle testing for vehicles having a weight less than 3500 kg and traffic safety is described. The proposal consists of two parts. (1) a theoretical consideration {{of the relationship between}} the state of maintenance <b>of</b> the <b>vehicles</b> and traffic safety. (2) a study into the influence of a general periodic vehicle testing on the number <b>of</b> <b>registered</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the netherlands. Changes in the number <b>of</b> <b>registered</b> <b>vehicles</b> and the state of maintenance are caused by changes in ownership, use, maintenance practice and market supply.

40|$|Good {{database}} design {{practices are}} well-known and proven. However, when a particular base has to include also a complete history of changes {{introduced to the}} data, the project realization becomes a much more complex task. If we take into account temporal aspects, we naturally transform {{the relations between the}} interlinked objects into the relationships between the states of these objects. Additionally, the possibility of various interpretations of time dependencies prevented us so far from developing a generally accepted methodology for designing temporal databases. This article is {{the first in a series}} of articles published within the framework of the work carried out on the system of the Central <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vehicles</b> and Drivers (in Polish: CEPiK). It presents the approach to the design of a relational database, which stores a complete history of the changes made to the states of these objects. It describes a database model, which explains in detail the influence of the changes made to the states of these objects, whilst also containing the life history of these objects and presents algorithms of the right operation modifying the state of the database. The presented approach has been used in practice to create one of CEPiK’s databases.

40|$|One {{main reason}} for {{automatic}} enforcement, except of the safety situation, is that the police {{will not be able}} to take direct action to each detected violator at normal police enforcement activities in some environments. By using detectors and camera technology the violators can be identified and sanctioned. Though it's almost three decades of use, automated traffic enforcement has mainly been applied to speed and red light violations. In the recent years, however, there has been an extension to other violations, e. g., following distance, lane keeping, and toll payment violations. The increased use of digital video and image processing technology, as well as the electronic identification of vehicles, has paved the way for extending the applications to a still wider spectrum of violations, as well as making the enforcement considerably more efficient in the future. Automatic enforcement always consist of at least three different procedures: Detection of the violation; Identification of the vehicle involved; Identification of and contact with the owner of the vehicle. In order to combine these procedures into one system the aim is of course to have to create a fully automatic system. Today the detection of the violation is automatic but the identification processes are more or less manual. The strategy for automatic enforcement varies a lot between countries depending on detection technology used, police force organisation, traffic legislation and sanction system. It is impossible to recommend a European harmonised solution. An important prerequisite for an efficient automated enforcement system is the availability of a centralised <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their owners at a national level. If the register were not centralised, the process of identifying vehicles and drivers from outside the jurisdiction where the violation takes place would be extremely laborious. That is also a reason why few countries routinely follow up violators from foreign countries. An example of sanctioning across borders is found in Scandinavia, where there are mutual agreements between Norway, Sweden and Denmark regarding the process of fining violators from the neighbouring countries. Some automated enforcement applications are manned; for example in those instances where the automatic system is operated from a police car. As long as the detection of violations is automatic, and the purpose of the manning is only to supervise the equipment, these applications are considered within our definition of automated enforcement (whereas applications depending on a police officer to initiate the recording when observing a suspect vehicle, is not automated.). An advantage of manned controls seems to be increased flexibility concerning the choice of sites. Extensive unmanned operation on the other hand requires a certain number of fixed facilities between which the equipment can be rotated. In the long run, however, the costs of such facilities are probably lower than the costs of manned operation for a similar level of enforcement.

40|$|The {{market system}} is {{unavailable}} to reflect negative externalities, caused by road motor traffic, in the realized prices. For that purpose, {{it would be}} appropriate to implement a general environmental road tax in the European Union member states.
