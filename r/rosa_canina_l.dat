40|$|The genus Rosa {{contains}} over 100 {{species that}} are widely distributed mostly in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North America. <b>Rosa</b> <b>canina</b> <b>L.</b> (dog rose) is an erect shrub of up to 3. 5 meters height, sometimes climbing; its branches are often curved or arched. Petals are white to pale pink, rarely deep pink and fruit ripens late. Information about the biology and biochemistry of <b>Rosa</b> <b>canina</b> <b>L.</b> has allowed a good documentation by presenting it in several ways (botanical, agro technical, chemical composition and uses). The dog rose hips (Cynosbati fructus) comprise several biologically active compounds, such as: sugars, organic acids, pectins, flavonoids, tannins, carotenoids, fatty acids, vitamins (particularly vitamin C and also vitamins B 1, B 2, K, PP, E), macro- and microelements etc. <b>Rosa</b> <b>canina.</b> <b>L.</b> fruits have constituted {{an important source of}} food and medicine for many cultures. Common food preparations using rose hips include juice, wine, tea, jelly, jam, as well as mixed with dried salmon eggs. Dog rose can be found all the mountains in the Republic of Macedonia. Usually grows in areas exposed to the sun, mostly on the southern slopes outside the forest or roadsides. The aim of our study was to evaluate the amount of the main phyto-chemicals (vitamin C, total polyphenols, and total flavonoids) content in the dog rose pulp obtained from two genotypes var. transitoria, altitude 1120 m, and var. assiensis, altitude 410 m. The results of our study revealed that regarding the content of vitamin C, the results have significant difference between the studied genotypes: 432. 2 mg/ 100 g dry pulp for var. transitoria versus 154. 3 mg/ 100 g dry pulp for var. assiensis. Contrary to these findings, the content of total polyphenos was found to be similar for the both genotypes: 594. 3 mg/ 100 g dry pulp for var. transitoria and 570. 3 mg/ 100 g dry pulp for var. assiensis. The content of total flavonoids expressed as mg quercitin/ 100 g dry pulp were 131 for var. transitoria and 172. 4 for var. assiensis. According to the obtained results, it can be concluded that the content of vitamin C in the pulp of <b>Rosa</b> <b>canina.</b> <b>L</b> is in direct correlation of the altitude where the plant grows.

Therefore, the immunmodulatory effect of standardized rose hip powder of <b>Rosa</b> <b>canina</b> <b>L.</b> was investigated and active principles isolated using the Mono Mac 6 cell line as a model for human macrophages. Treatment of Mono Mac 6 cells with the residue of a crude dichloromethane extract of rose hip powder significantly and concentration dependently inhibited the lipopolysaccharide induced interleukin- 6 release. Through bioassay-guided fractionation the immunomodulatory effect of the dichloromethane extract was correlated to a mixture of three triterpene acids; oleanolic acid, betulinic acid and ursolic acid (IC 50 21 ± 6 µM). Further studies revealed that only oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, but not betulinic acid, could inhibit the lipopolysaccharide induced interleukin- 6 release from Mono Mac 6 cells when tested separately. Combination of either oleanolic acid or ursolic acid with betulinic acid enhanced the immunomodulatory effect of the two triterpene acids...|$|E
