50|$|Many {{individuals}} and organizations argued that the settlement in the consent decree should have included broader relief. However, the judge said {{that was not the}} test; the test is whether settlement is fair and reasonable compared to cost of trial. The judge found that the two tracks would ensure prompt distribution, while a trial would have been complicated, long, and costly. Also, the judge appointed a monitor to track and <b>report</b> <b>on</b> <b>enforcement</b> and court retained jurisdiction. Notably, the USDA would not include a provision that they would prevent future discrimination. The court concluded the Consent Decree represented a significant first step away from historical discrimination.

40|$|This report {{assesses the}} efforts made by OECD members to curb bribery {{practices}} and global corruption. This is the seventh annual Progress <b>Report</b> <b>on</b> <b>Enforcement</b> of the OECD Convention prepared by Transparency International (TI), the global coalition against corruption. The OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Offi cials in International Business Transactions, adopted in 1997, requires each State Party to make foreign bribery a crime. The Convention has 38 parties and is {{overseen by the}} OECD Working Group on Bribery. The Working Group conducts a follow-up monitoring process under which representatives of two governments and the Secretariat visit each member country and assess its compliance with the Convention’s provisions. The monitoring process {{is now in its}} third phase, which focuses primarily on enforcement and on the steps which countries have taken to follow up on recommendations in prior reviews. The OECD Convention is a key instrument for combating global corruption because the parties are involved in two-thirds of international trade and three-quarters of international investment. The Working Group’s monitoring process has been conducted in a rigorous and highly professional manner, which provides a model for other treaties.  Follow-up monitoring is important to make sure that governments comply with their treaty commitments. TI’s annual progress reports represent an independent assessment of the status of OECD Convention enforcement.  The reports have shown steady progress in the decade since the Convention went into effect. There is now active enforcement in seven countries, which represent 30 per cent of world exports, and moderate enforcement in nine countries, which represent 20 per cent of world exports. However, {{there is little or no}} enforcement in 21 countries, which represent 15 per cent of world exports. There has been no change in these numbers in the past year. This trend raises concern about whether the Convention is losing forward momentum. Continued lack of enforcement in 21 countries a decade after the Convention entered into force, notwithstanding repeated OECD reviews, clearly indicates lack of political commitment by their governments. And in some of those with moderate enforcement, the level of commitment is also uncertain. This is a danger signal because the OECD Convention depends on the collective commitment of all parties to ending foreign bribery...|$|E

40|$|Qualitative data <b>on</b> <b>enforcement</b> of {{the minimum}} {{drinking}} age in the United States were obtained through in depth interviews with law enforcement officers in May and June 1992. Interviews were conducted with 37 supervisory and line law enforcement personnel in 15 city and county law enforcement agencies in four States. The selected agencies had varying levels of enforcement as measured by arrest rates. Interviews focused on {{the social and political}} context of enforcement of the drinking age, constraints to enforcement, and officers' recommendations for improving enforcement efforts. Officers generally perceive an acceptance of youth drinking by many segments of their communities, and they do not receive significant encouragement from community members to increase enforcement efforts. Political factors are thought to play some role in determining enforcement levels, especially in sheriffs' departments. <b>Reported</b> constraints <b>on</b> <b>enforcement</b> {{of the minimum}} drinking age include resource limitations, a number of practical problems, perceptions that punishments are inadequate, time and effort required for processing and paperwork, and the low status accorded enforcement of the minimum drinking age.

In addition, many observers are concerned these reported declines may reduce taxpayers' motivation to voluntarily pay their taxes. Because of these concerns, GAO was asked to review a number of issues surrounding IRS's enforcement efforts. GAO determined the trends in the percent of returns filed that are audited (contact rate) compared with similar data on taxpayer contacts through other enforcement programs for fiscal years 1993 through 2002.

40|$|News media {{ought to}} be {{recognised}} {{as one of the}} factors that can affect attitudes towards and demand for illicit drugs and there is an opportunity to expand use of news media to shape youth attitudes to drugs. This research funded by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing explored the ways that the Australian print media portrays illicit drug use and how this impacts on youth attitudes. The research method included a retrospective content analysis of 4, 397 newspaper articles from 2003 to 2008; a national online survey of 2, 296 youth aged 16 - 24 who <b>reported</b> <b>on</b> the impact of various portrayals on their perception of the risk, acceptability and likelihood of future illicit drug use; and an exploration of media effects on 52 youth attending focus groups. The media content analysis provides a detailed overview of what is making illicit drugs appear in Australian news media, the implied consequences of drug use, moral evaluation of drug use, and the number and type of sources cited in current newspaper reporting. The dominant portrayals in Australian newspaper coverage depicted law enforcement or criminal justice action, and emphasised the legal problems associated with drugs/use. Coverage of harms from illicit drugs was much more rare. The survey indicated that news media reporting can deter interest in illicit drug use. But the most effective reports for deterring interest are currently under-reported in Australian news media. This is because the most effective reports covered health and social harms. These were more effective than the <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> law <b>enforcement</b> arrests or drug busts. The research concludes that, while exploratory, it suggests news media {{ought to be}} recognised as one of the factors that can affect attitudes towards and demand for illicit drugs and there is an opportunity to expand use of news media to shape youth attitudes to drugs through more targeted media engagement about health and social harms from drug use.
