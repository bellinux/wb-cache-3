50|$|The {{standard}} phrases {{are defined}} in Annexes III and IV of the directive. Annex III defines phrases {{relating to the}} Nature of special risks attributed to dangerous substances and preparations, {{often referred to as}} <b>R-phrases.</b> Annex IV defines phrases relating to Safety advice concerning dangerous substances and preparations, often referred to as S-phrases.|$|E
50|$|The European Union has {{implemented}} the GHS through the CLP Regulation. Nevertheless, the older {{system based on}} the Dangerous Substances Directive wase used in parallel until June 2015. Some <b>R-phrases</b> which do not have simple equivalents under the GHS have been retained under the CLP Regulation: the numbering mirrors {{the number of the}} previous R-phrase.|$|E

5000|$|Hazard {{statements}} {{form part}} of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). They are intended to form a set of standardized phrases about the hazards of chemical substances and mixtures that can be translated into different languages. As such, they serve the same purpose as the well-known <b>R-phrases,</b> which {{they are intended to}} replace.|$|E
40|$|TheTh UK has {{developed}} a simple scheme to provide practical control advice to {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs), to assist them in their risk assessments and risk management decisions. This scheme makes use of toxicological hazard information indicated by <b>R-phrases</b> assigned under the European Union (EU) classification system, to assign substances to hazard bands. In the UK scheme, the allocation of substances to hazard bands according to <b>R-phrases</b> has taken into account three key factors: whether or not the toxicological endpoint has an identifiable dose threshold; the seriousness of the resultant health effect; and the relative exposure levels at which toxic effects occur. Based on all these considerations, <b>R-phrases</b> have been allocated to hazard bands within the scheme. An evaluation exercise has been undertaken, to compare the output of the scheme with established health-based occupational exposure limits, for more than 100 subst-ances. The results of this exercise demonstrate that as far as possible, the scheme recommends control strategies which should provide adequate control. This scheme is potentially a very powerful means of helping SMEs adequately control chemical health risks in the workplace. Since it utilises the EU-agreed classification system, the scheme can be applied to any substance supplied and used in the workplace and it may also be used internationally. ICrown copyright © 1998.

40|$|Characterization {{of toxic}} {{chemicals}} with relevance to human exposure does normally not belong to Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) and is still a topic of research. The concept of hazard potential classes proposed in this paper is primarily based on threshold limit values that {{are considered to be}} a measure of the severity of potential effects. In the absence of threshold limit values the <b>R-phrases</b> of the ordinance of dangerous substances are used. Substances are assigned to five hazard potential classes (A to E). Potentially dangerous chemicals are identified ad substances of low toxicological relevance are excluded from further evaluation. The location where a probable exposure might occur (indoor versus outdoor) and inter-media transport of substances is considered. The product comparison is based both on the results of the proposed "semi-quantitative screening method" and on toxicological expert knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Sorbent based {{methods have}} been {{successfully}} used {{in the collection of}} air samples to determine air quality. The complexity of the occurrence in air samples of several compounds in terms of composition (polar to non-polar compounds, very volatile to semi-volatile compounds) and abundance (below detection limit to over detector saturation limit) are topics that have {{to be taken into account}} when analytical methods are developed, especially in terms of sorbent choosing. An important amount of compounds found in air (eg. volatile organic compounds (VOC), volatile sulphur compounds (VSC) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) generate odour problems, have associated <b>R-phrases,</b> are ozone precursors or have been declared carcinogens. The knowledge of their concentrations is very important to define air quality, not only in terms of odour nuisance but also in terms of toxicity. Therefore, emission and immission controls are important in air quality determination, both outdoors and indoors. Activated charcoal, Tenax TA, XAD- 2, Carbotrap, Carbopack, Carbosieve and Carboxen 569 are found among the different types of sorbents available. They have variable selectivity towards the different types of compounds present in air. Hence, a good combination of different sorbents may allow the determination of a wide range of compounds in air samples. The idoneity, the hydrophobicity and the mesh size of the adsorbent particles together with the air flow, the air volume sampled, the ambient temperature and humidity would determine the adsorption efficiency of a compound. Several techniques are available for desorbing the compounds adsorbed, being the most relevant the ones based on thermal desorption and solvent extractions. When developing an analytical methodology, several quality criteria have to be taken into account focusing in the selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, breakthrough and accuracy of the method. Comparatives between different types of sorbents (Tenax TA, self-made multi-bed tubes (Carbotrap, Carbopack X and Carboxen- 569) and Radiello) arè done to determine the most reliable sorbent for the determination of concrete compounds present both in urban, rural and indoor air.
