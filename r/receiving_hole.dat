50|$|The process {{starts with}} the <b>receiving</b> <b>hole</b> and {{entrance}} pits. These pits will allow the drilling fluid to be collected and reclaimed to reduce costs and prevent waste. The first stage drills a pilot hole on the designed path, and the second stage (reaming) enlarges the hole by passing a larger cutting tool known as the back reamer. The reamer's diameter depends {{on the size of}} the pipe to be pulled back through the bore hole. The driller increases the diameter according to the outer diameter or the conduit and to achieve optimal production. The third stage places the product or casing pipe in the enlarged hole by way of the drill stem; it is pulled behind the reamer to allow centering of the pipe in the newly reamed path.|$|E
50|$|As {{the punch}} is further {{pressed against the}} workpiece, the tumbler travels back until the point where its tapered {{midsection}} begins contacting {{the surface of the}} guide hole {{in the body of the}} punch. As it continues back, it is pushed into alignment with the center axis of the tool. When the tip of the tumbler is nearly centered, it slips into the <b>receiving</b> <b>hole</b> in the hammer mass, and releases the hammer. The hammer mass is then allowed to move forward, propelled by the rear spring. Because the hole in the hammer mass does not go through the mass and is less deep than the end section of the tumbler, the tip of the tumbler bottoms out in the hole in the hammer, and the impulse of the hammer mass is transmitted through the tumbler, through the punch, and to the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the later}} {{generation}} Beretta 92/96/M9 series, the Px4's trigger guard is rounded for better concealed carry. The takedown pin of earlier models {{is replaced by}} a spring-loaded bar, accessed via frame recesses on both sides, which must be grasped and pulled down simultaneously to release the slide. The slide spring is doubly captive, being inserted approximately an inch into the transfer block at one end and a <b>receiving</b> <b>hole</b> {{in the front of the}} slide at the other. It is a self-contained assembly, completely captured by the polymer guide. The magazine holds the top round directly behind the barrel's breech end so only a slight feed ramp is needed. This allows the barrel to fully support the case. The 6-R rifling of the barrel generates counter-clockwise torque which is harnessed by the locking system to reduce the amount of pressure required from the rotating barrel lock's cam and pin system to effect unlocking. The steel transfer block's cam pin is 5 mm wide and 2 mm deep. The entire hammer unit mechanism can be removed from the Px4, without the use of special tools, as a single group. This allows easy access to the firing mechanism for cleaning. The Px4's design makes it impossible to assemble incorrectly from a field-stripped takedown.|$|E

40|$|Although {{loosening}} of cemented glenoid components {{is one of}} {{the major}} complications of total shoulder arthroplasty, there is little information about factors affecting initial fixation of these components in the scapular neck. This study was performed to assess the characteristics of structural fixation of pegged glenoid components, if inserted with two different recommended cementing techniques. Six fresh-frozen shoulder specimens and two types of glenoid components were used. The glenoids were prepared according to the instructions and with the instrumentation of the manufacturer. In 3 specimens, the bone cement was inserted into the peg <b>receiving</b> <b>holes</b> (n = 12) and applied to the back surface of the glenoid component with a syringe. In the other 3 specimens, the cement was inserted into the holes (n = 15) by use of pure finger pressure: no cement was applied on the backside of the component. Micro-computed tomography scans with a resolution of 36 microm showed an intact cement mantle around all 12 pegs (100 %) when a syringe was used. An incomplete cement plug was found in 7 of 15 pegs (47 %) when the finger-pressure technique was used. Cement penetration into the cancellous bone was deeper in osteopenic bone. Application of bone cement on the backside of the glenoid prosthesis improved seating by filling out small spaces between bone and polyethylene resulting from irregularities after reaming or local cement extrusion from a drill hole. The fixation of a pegged glenoid component is better if the holes are filled with cement under pressure by use of a syringe and if cement is applied to the back of the glenoid component than if cement is inserted with pure finger pressure and no cement is applied to the back surface of the component...|$|R

30|$|In [21], a novel sensing scheme {{combining}} {{the best of}} stand-alone and cooperative spectrum sensing has been proposed. A coordinating node senses the spectrum and forms a table of spectrum holes. It sends a list of empty slots (holes) to the requesting vehicle. The requesting vehicle then rescans the <b>received</b> <b>holes</b> and reconfirms {{the availability of the}} spectrum. If it finds a hole, it utilizes it for communication. In [22], a cluster-based scheme is proposed with each cluster having a cluster head. The cluster head senses the spectrum and assigns the spectrum holes to its cluster members. These papers do not include the shadowing, correlation, and distance factors as a hole for one vehicle may not be a hole for another due to a high dynamic environment. In [23], the authors have a division of the wideband spectrum into small sub-bands and assigning a sub-band to a group of vehicles to sense and utilize the provided spectrum. This paper does not take into consideration any criteria for assigning any sub-band to a particular group of vehicles. The assigned sub-band may or may not suit any particular group of vehicles. In [24], multi-RAT technology has been discussed. It suggests usage of different technologies for different classes of service such as Wi-Fi for data exchange and Wi-MAX for video conferencing. In this paper, no spectrum sensing technique or any cooperative scheme has been discussed. In [25], a two-user model has been proposed. In this model, one user acts as a relay sending the information regarding the primary user’s presence or absence to the other user. In this model, two cooperative sensing schemes have been proposed. In the first scheme, one user detects the primary user’s presence or absence and relays to the other user through a central controller. In the second scheme (in order to reduce the detection time), the amplify and forward (AF) protocol has been used.|$|R
3000|$|At {{a certain}} time, the hole {{injection}} rate becomes very slow because almost all Ag+ ions coming {{into contact with}} Ag particles or the silicon surface are reduced into Ag. Subsequently, silicon oxidation becomes very slow, causing {{a decrease in the}} silicon etching rate, hence the need to use a complementary hole injection species to allow the continuation of the silicon nanostructuring. Consequently, H 2 O 2 is added to the etching solution because it is a strong oxidant capable of playing a major role of hole injection instead of Ag ions. The moment that coincides with the addition of the hydrogen peroxide is the start time of the second step related to the MACE reactions as it is illustrated in Figure  5 under the label step 2. In fact, Si atoms underneath Ag particles <b>receive</b> <b>holes</b> not only from the reduction of hydronium ions (H 3 O+) but mainly from the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Both reactions occur at the silver cluster/acid solution interface. In brief, H 2 O 2 contributes greatly in increasing the hole flow rate towards silicon and facilitates its dissolution. Furthermore, H 2 O 2 may even oxidize the Ag particles previously nucleated on the silicon surface or stacked to the silver microclusters. This oxidation permits the feeding of the solution with Ag+ ions, enhances hole injection, and keeps the silicon dissolution going. Both silver microclusters and silicon surfaces maintain their microelectrochemical roles as during the silver plating step: cathode and anode, respectively. Cathode and anode reactions are sketched and exposed by numerous previous works[12, 13, 24, 33, 34]. Among the numerous models proposed for the dissolution process of silicon, we think that the model established by Chartier et al. is the most convincing. Indeed, in contrast to other models, Chartier and co-workers evidenced that H 2 is produced as an anodic reaction simultaneously to the direct dissolution of silicon in its divalent state (SiF 62 -)[13]. This process can be described by the following equations: [...]...|$|R
