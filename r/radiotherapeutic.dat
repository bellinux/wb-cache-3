Leon finally confronts Saddler, and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island self-destructs.|$|E
25|$|Cancer cells exhibit greater ROS stress {{than normal}} cells do, {{partly due to}} oncogenic stimulation, {{increased}} metabolic activity and mitochondrial malfunction. ROS is a double-edged sword. On one hand, at low levels, ROS facilitates cancer cell survival since cell-cycle progression driven by growth factors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) require ROS for activation and chronic inflammation, a major mediator of cancer, is regulated by ROS. On the other hand, {{a high level of}} ROS can suppress tumor growth through the sustained activation of cell-cycle inhibitor and induction of cell death as well as senescence by damaging macromolecules. In fact, most of the chemotherapeutic and <b>radiotherapeutic</b> agents kill cancer cells by augmenting ROS stress. The ability of cancer cells to distinguish between ROS as a survival or apoptotic signal is controlled by the dosage, duration, type, and site of ROS production. Modest levels of ROS are required for cancer cells to survive, whereas excessive levels kill them.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} to these developments, {{a similar approach}} was designed for a linear particle accelerator or Linac. Installation of the first 4MeV clinical linear accelerator began in June 1952 in the Medical Research Council (MRC) <b>Radiotherapeutic</b> Research Unit at the Hammersmith Hospital, London.

In 1982, the Spanish neurosurgeon J. Barcia-Salorio began to evaluate the role of cobalt-generated and then Linac-based photon radiosurgery for the treatment of AVMs and epilepsy. In 1984, Betti and Derechinsky described a Linac-based radiosurgical system. Winston and Lutz further advanced Linac-based radiosurgical prototype technologies by incorporating an improved stereotactic positioning device and a method to measure the accuracy of various components. Using a modified Linac, the first patient in the United States was treated in Boston Brigham and Women's Hospital in February 1986.|$|E

50|$|Following {{embolization}} of the yttrium-90 glass microspheres in tumorous liver tissue, {{the beta}} radiation emitted provides a therapeutic effect. The microspheres are delivered into the liver tumor through a catheter placed into the hepatic artery that supplies {{blood to the}} tumor. This is usually performed in a hospital's radiology suite and patients remain conscious throughout the procedure. The microspheres are unable {{to pass through the}} vasculature of the liver due to arteriolar capillary blockade and are trapped in the tumor. There they exert a local <b>radiotherapeutic</b> effect with some damage to surrounding normal liver tissue.|$|E
50|$|IORT {{was found}} to be useful and {{feasible}} in the multidisciplinary management of many solid tumors but further studies are needed to determine the benefit more precisely. Single-institution experiences have suggested a role of IORT e.g. in brain tumors and cerebral metastases, locally advanced and recurrent rectal cancer, skin cancer, retroperitoneal sarcoma, pancreatic cancer and selected gynaecologic and genitourinary malignancies. For local recurrences, irradiation with IORT is besides brachytherapy the only <b>radiotherapeutic</b> option if repeated EBRT is no longer possible. Generally, the normal tissue tolerance does not allow a second full-dose course of EBRT, even after years.|$|E

50|$|Notably, GJA1 {{expression}} {{has been}} associated {{with a wide variety of}} cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, meningioma, hemangiopericytoma, liver tumor, colon cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, mesothelioma, glioblastoma, lung cancer, adrenocortical tumors, renal cell cancer, cervical carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, prostate cancer, thyroid carcinoma, and testis cancer. Its role in controlling cell motility and polarity was thought to contribute to cancer development and metastasis, though its role as a gap junction protein may also be involved. Moreover, the cytoprotective effects of this protein can promote tumor cell survival in radiotherapy treatments, while silencing its gene increases radiosensitivity. As a result, GJA1 may serve as a target for improving the success of <b>radiotherapeutic</b> treatment of cancer. As a biomarker, GJA1 could also be used to screen young males for risk of testis cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Radiotherapy {{of cancer}} cells using 64Cu {{can be applied}} in medical {{research}} and clinical practice. The advantages of radiotherapy with beta emitters of this energy are that there is enough to do substantial damage to the target cells but the mean range in tissue {{is less than a}} millimeter so non target tissues are unlikely to be harmed. [...] In addition, 64Cu is a positron emitter making it a viable PET imaging radionuclide which can give real time images of the physiological processes in the system. These abilities in conjunction enable accurate monitoring of drug distribution and biokinetics simultaneously. <b>Radiotherapeutic</b> efficacy of copper-64 depends highly upon the radioligand delivery to the target cells, so the development of bifunctional chelates is central to development of 64Cuâ€™s potential as a radiopharmaceutical.|$|E

50|$|The initial {{angiographic}} evaluation {{can include}} an abdominal aortogram, Superior mesenteric and Celiac arteriograms, and selective {{right and left}} hepatic arteriograms. These studies allow for documentation of the gastrointestinal vascular anatomy and flow characteristics. Extrahepatic vessels found on angiographic evaluation are often embolized {{in order to prevent}} nontarget deposition of microspheres, that can lead to gastrointestinal ulceration. Once the branch of the hepatic artery supplying the tumor is identified and the tip of the catheter is selectively placed within the artery, the 90Y microspheres are infused. The radiation dose absorbed is dependent on microsphere distribution within the tumor vascularization. Equal distribution is necessary to ensure tumor cells are not spared due to 2.5mm mean tissue penetration, with maximum penetration up to 11mm. Injection of <b>radiotherapeutic</b> materials through the hepatic artery allows for targeted delivery of treatment to a hepatic tumor with significantly reduced damage to surrounding tissue. Tumor angiogenesis creates preferential arterial flow to the tumor bed, increasing delivery of particles to tumor rather than to normal liver parenchyma (which mainly receives flow from the portal venous system).|$|E

Common curative methods of treating skin tumours include surgical, <b>radiotherapeutic,</b> chemotherapeutic or biological treatment or their combination. The subject of my thesis is the role of radiotherapy in treatment of skin tumours. I have compared the results of <b>radiotherapeutic</b> treatment in the period from 1981 to 1985 and from 2001 to 2005 in the oncology ward of Nemocnice ÄŒeskÃ© BudÄ›jovice, and also examined the count of radiated patients in comparison with the number of all reported skin tumours. On the basis of these statistical data we obtain a certain idea of the rate of use of both the above stated methods in treatment of carcinoma. The first part of my thesis is theoretical and provides a historical survey of tumour diseases, based on study of technical literature. Following the survey, I address radiotherapy in general and attend to skin anatomy; a special chapter is focused on skin cancer and its symptoms. The theoretical part describes curative methods of skin tumours. With regard to the topic of the thesis I pay larger attention to selection of a radiation source and to general planning of <b>radiotherapeutic</b> treatment. This part of the thesis includes a description of radiation side effects and a section discussing prevention of tumour diseases. In the practical part I compare the results of <b>radiotherapeutic</b> treatment of patients treated in two five-year intervals in the space of 16 years.
