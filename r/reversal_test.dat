A maximum of eleven (11) leak-free, fluid expulsions were achieved by a 25 deg cone angle diaphragm hoop-reinforced with. 110 -inch cross-sectional diameter wires. This represents a 70 % improvement in diaphragm reversal cycle life compared to results previously obtained.

40|$|Abstract. In-plane tension/compression {{tests of}} a {{dual phase steel}} sheet with a tensile {{strength}} of 780 MPa were carried out using in-plane stress <b>reversal</b> <b>testing</b> machine. Remarkable tension/ compression asymmetry of flow stress (TCA) has been observed. Moreover, biaxial tensile tests using cruciform specimens were performed to measure contours of plastic work. The test material exhibited differential work hardening (DWH). In order to reproduce the TCA, an asymmetric quadratic yield function proposed by Verma et al. (2011) was used. The parameters of the yield function were changed {{as a function of}} reference plastic strain to reproduce the DWH. Furthermore, to assess the springback prediction accuracy of the developed model, a 3 -point bending experiment and finite element analyses (FEA) were performed.

Because cognitive functions {{play a key role}} in animal exploration, in the present study we assessed the role of Me 5 in spatial learning and memory in the water maze. Mice with bilateral Me 5 lesions exhibited severe deficits in both a reversal learning and a <b>reversal</b> probe <b>test</b> compared with sham-operated mice. In spite of these <b>reversal</b> <b>tests,</b> Me 5 lesions had no effect on a hidden platform test. These results suggest that Me 5 -lesioned mice show a perseveration of the previously learned spatial strategy rather than an inability to learn a new strategy, resulting in reduced spatial memory resetting. Moreover, adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, which has been proposed to have a causal relationship to spatial memory, was stimulated in Me 5 -lesioned mice. Thus, a stimulation of hippocampal neurogenesis observed after Me 5 lesions may lead to a rigidity and perseverance of the previously learned strategy because of inferential overuse of past memories in a novel situation. These results suggest that Me 5 contributes to spatial memory resetting by controlling the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis through an ascending neuronal pathway to the hippocampus...|$|R

For this purpose, a series of liquefaction tests with constant amplitude cyclic stresses were performed on sand samples which had been previously　subjected to simple stresses. Through this study, it has been recognized that the effects of stress history on the liquefaction characteristics of saturated sand are brought about by fabric changes during preshearing, an that the character of these effects of stress history can be explained by the observations obtained during stress <b>reversal</b> <b>tests</b> on dry sand...|$|R

Compression-tension and shear <b>reversal</b> <b>tests</b> were performed to examine the Bauschinger effect at high levels of forming strain. Good correlation between the shear reversal and the compression-tension test was observed suggesting that for DP steel, shear stress strain data, converted to equivalent stress-strain, may be applied directly to characterize kinematic hardening behavior for numerical simulations. Permanent softening was observed following strain reversal and increased with martensite volume fraction and pre-strain level. While the Bauschinger ratio saturates at 3 % pre-strain, the Bauschinger strain increases linearly with forming strain without showing saturation.

40|$|Abstract—This paper reports recent {{progress}} in ultra-wideband (UWB) radio testbed design and development. Exper-imental radio testbeds are ideal means to verify theoretically ideas, test feasibility, {{and reduce the}} uncertainty between the-oretical expectation and practical implementation. The testbed under development has been designed as a general experimental platform to explore the advanced radio technologies, such as UWB based communications as well as ranging, physical layer security, optimum transmit waveforms, and cognitive radio. Our preliminary testbed includes a transmitter and a receiver, with a single UWB antenna at each side. It can be expanded to include multiple transmitters and receivers, multiple antennas at one or both sides, and a feedback link paired with the forward link. Programmability and flexibility are top concerns in the system design, and these two design goals are reflected throughout the three building blocks, i. e., baseband, mixed-signal and RF front-end. Two major contributions of the paper are: 1) providing the art of design and implementation with theoretical guideline; 2) demonstration {{of a set of}} end-to-end radio testbed {{for a wide range of}} research exploration—To our best knowledge, it is the first testbed with UWB time reversal function.

40|$|Detailed rock {{magnetic}} and {{electron microscope}} analyses {{indicate that the}} magnetic signature of Neogene marine sediments from {{the east coast of}} New Zealand is dominated by the authigenic iron sulphide greigite. The greigite is present as a mixed population of stable single domain and superparamagnetic grains, which is consistent with authigenic growth from solution. This growth can result from pyritization reactions soon after deposition, which also leads to dissolution of most detrital magnetite; however, where constrained by field tests, our data suggest that remanence acquisition can occur > 1 Myr after deposition, and can vary in timing at the outcrop scale. Strong viscous overprints result from oxidation of the iron sulphides, probably during percolation of oxic ground water. This process can sometimes destroy any ancient remanent magnetization. This complex magnetic behaviour, particularly the presence of late-forming magnetizations carried by greigite, means that the remanence in New Zealand Cenozoic sediments, and in similar sediments elsewhere, cannot be assumed to be primary without confirmation by field <b>tests.</b> The <b>reversals</b> <b>test</b> should be employed with caution in such sediments, as patchy remagnetizations can lead to false polarity stratigraphies...|$|R

This post-Eocene final separation (exact age is not constrained directly, but estimated as end-of-Miocene) was preceded by a small CW rotation of Adria with respect to Africa, suggested by unchanged orientation of the former across the Cretaceous– Paleocene boundary, while the latter continued its CCW rotation. ...|$|R
