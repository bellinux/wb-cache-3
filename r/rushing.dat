5|$|Michigan's <b>rushing</b> {{touchdown}} {{in the fourth quarter}} snapped a streak of 24 quarters where Iowa hadn't allowed a <b>rushing</b> touchdown (dating back to the Orange Bowl vs. Georgia Tech). With his <b>rushing</b> performance, Denard Robinson surpassed 1,000 <b>rushing</b> yards for the season, becoming just the second Big Ten quarterback to accomplish the feat in conference history. Indiana's Antwaan Randle El established the Big Ten record for <b>rushing</b> yards by a quarterback (1,270) in 2000. Robinson ended the contest with 1,096 <b>rushing</b> yards on the year.|$|E

5|$|Tarkenton is {{also the}} {{franchise}} leader for <b>rushing</b> attempts and <b>rushing</b> yards as a quarterback, but it is Daunte Culpepper – with 72 fewer <b>rushing</b> yards on 10 fewer attempts than Tarkenton – who has the most <b>rushing</b> touchdowns.

He was the first to rush for over ten touchdowns in a season, a feat he {{accomplished}} three times before any other player did so once. He was the last Eagles player to win the <b>rushing</b> title until LeSean McCoy led the league in <b>rushing</b> yards in 2013.

5|$|Alabama's defense again had {{a strong}} {{performance}} in only allowing the Rebels 141 total yards of offense (28 <b>rushing,</b> 113 passing). Richardson set a new career high with his 183 <b>rushing</b> yards and four <b>rushing</b> touchdowns. For his performance, Richardson was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Week. The 52 total points were the most Alabama had scored in a SEC game since defeating Vanderbilt 59–28 in 1990. The victory was their eighth straight over Ole Miss and improved Alabama's all-time record against the Rebels 45–9–2 (49–8–2 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E

Hardesty had 1,345 <b>rushing</b> yards on the season, the fourth-highest season total for any player in Tennessee's history. Tennessee's No. 2 rusher was Tauren Poole, who gained 15 yards on 3 carries. Collectively, Tennessee had just five yards net <b>rushing,</b> the second-least ever in a Tennessee bowl game and the least allowed by Virginia Tech in a bowl game.

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1996 regular season, the Nebraska Cornhuskers boasted the No. 4 <b>rushing</b> offense in Division I-A college football, averaging 292 <b>rushing</b> yards per game and 422 overall yards per game. Despite those figures, the Cornhuskers' two leading rushers were hampered by injury and their participation was in doubt. Ahman Green, who led the Nebraska offense with 155 carries, 917 <b>rushing</b> yards, and seven touchdowns, suffered a stress fracture in his foot during the second-to-last Nebraska regular-season game. The No. 2 rusher, DeAngelo Evans, had 776 <b>rushing</b> yards and a team-high 14 <b>rushing</b> touchdowns, but was limited by a groin injury. Because of the injuries, Damon Benning, who earned 465 yards and seven touchdowns during the regular seasons, was anticipated to see significant playing time.

In that same period, Maryland also improved from last to first in the conference in <b>rushing,</b> {{due in large part to}} Heisman Trophy candidate and school career <b>rushing</b> leader LaMont Jordan.

Also, defensive end Murray Shelton recovered a fumble and returned it for a touchdown. Hughitt's <b>rushing</b> touchdown was the final score of the game.|$|E
5|$|His {{abilities}} seemingly in decline, Johnson {{was traded}} to Pittsburgh in 1960, where he had the most productive years of his career, recording two 1,000-yard <b>rushing</b> seasons.
