25|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>genetics</b> is a {{powerful}} tool to study and characterize the previously unknown viral genes. <b>Reverse</b> <b>genetics</b> system is currently available for VHSV. A vaccinia virus free reverse genetic system for Great Lakes VHSV (Genotype IVb) was developed by a research group from the USA. This system allows the investigators to explore the functional properties of individual viral genes of VHSV in detail. This system was immediately utilized to characterize the non-virion (NV) gene of novirhabdoviruses. Even though it has been demonstrated that the NV gene is not necessary for viral replication, it is highly essential for viral pathogenesis. A new role of NV protein has been discovered and demonstrated that it inhibits apoptosis at the early stage of viral infection. This discovery unlocked the mystery of presence of NV proteins in novirhabdoviruses.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} these {{homeotic}} genes determine an organ’s identity becomes evident when a gene that represents a particular function, for example the A gene, is not expressed. In Arabidopsis this loss results in a flower which is composed of one verticil of carpels, another containing stamens and another of carpels. This method for studying gene function uses <b>reverse</b> <b>genetics</b> techniques to produce transgenic plants that contain a mechanism for gene silencing through RNA interference. In other studies, using forward genetics techniques such as genetic mapping, it is {{the analysis of the}} phenotypes of flowers with structural anomalies that leads to the cloning of the gene of interest. The flowers may possess a non-functional or over expressed allele for the gene being studied.|$|E
500|$|A Morpholino, {{also known}} as a Morpholino {{oligomer}} and as a phosphorodiamidate Morpholino oligomer (PMO), is a type of oligomer molecule (colloquially, an oligo) used in molecular biology to modify gene expression. Its molecular structure has DNA bases attached to a backbone of methylenemorpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups. Morpholinos block access of other molecules to small (~25 base) specific sequences of the base-pairing surfaces of ribonucleic acid (RNA).

40|$|This review {{describes}} {{some recent}} advances in the molecular-genetic analysis of mouse development. <b>Reversed</b> <b>genetics</b> and gene assignment {{have been used to}} isolate genes affected in developmental mutations. The establishment of a high-density molecular-genetic map promises to facilitate cloning of additional genes with developmental functions. Based on molecular, biochemical or other biological criteria many mouse genes that code for transcriptional regulators, growth-factor-like molecules and their receptors have been isolated. The role of these genes during development can be analysed in vivo after producing targeted mutations. Mutations can be generated by homologous recombination in the genome of embryonic stem cells and can then be introduced into the mouse germ line by means of germ-line chimaeras. Additional approaches employing stem cells to identify and mutate putative developmental genes are coming into use...|$|R

However, functional evidence for the roles of monosaccharide transporters in rice (Oryza sativa) has not previously been presented. In this study, <b>reversed</b> <b>genetics</b> was used to identify OsGMST 1 {{as a member of}} the monosaccharide transporter family in rice. The predicted 481 amino acid protein has the typical features of a sugar transporter in the plastid glucose transporter subfamily consistent with reduced monosaccharide accumulation in plants with reduced OsGMST 1 expression. OsGMST 1 -green fluorescent protein is localized to the Golgi apparatus. OsGMST 1 expression is induced by salt treatment and reduced expression confers hypersensitivity to salt stress in rice. OsGMST 1 may play a direct or an indirect role in tolerance to salt stress in rice...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPlakoglobin is {{the only}} {{component}} common to both the desmosomal plaque and the cadherin–catenin cell adhesion complex in the adherens junction. It is highly homologous to vertebrate β-catenin and toDrosophilaarmadillo protein and may—like these proteins—be also involved in signaling pathways. To analyze the role of plakoglobin during mouse development we inactivated theplakoglobingene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells and generated transgenic mice. Plakoglobinnull-mutant embryos died from Embryonic Day 10. 5 onward, due to severe heart defects. Some mutant embryos developed further, especially on a C 57 BL/ 6 genetic background, and died around birth, presumably due to cardiac dysfunction, and with skin blistering and subcorneal acantholysis. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that here desmosomes were greatly reduced in number and structurally altered. Thus, using <b>reversed</b> <b>genetics</b> we demonstrate that plakoglobin is an essential structural component for desmosome function. The skin phenotype in plakoglobin-deficient mice {{is reminiscent of the}} human blistering disease, epidermolytic hyperkeratosis...|$|R

Through unbiased forward genetic screens designed to detect perturbations in neuronal function, he has uncovered many genes involved in synaptic transmission and has used <b>reverse</b> <b>genetics</b> to help to establish their function. His lab was the first to provide in vivo evidence that Synaptotagmin 1 functions as the main Calcium sensor in synaptic transmission [...] and that Syntaxin-1A plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion in vivo. His lab showed that Endophilin and Synaptojanin control uncoating of SVs, that the V0 component of the v-ATPase affects SV fusion, that synaptic mitochondria control SV dynamics, and in addition discovered a novel calcium channel involved in SV biogenesis. His pioneering work on synaptic vesicle trafficking molecules was later confirmed in the mouse.|$|E

40|$|Reductive {{dehalogenation}} of {{vinyl chloride}} (VC) to ethene {{is the key}} step in complete anaerobic degradation of chlorinated ethenes. VC-reductive dehalogenase was partially purified from a highly enriched culture of the VC-respiring Dehalococcoides sp. strain VS. The enzyme reduced VC and all dichloroethene (DCE) isomers, but not tetrachloroethene (PCE) or trichloroethene (TCE), at high rates. By using <b>reversed</b> <b>genetics,</b> the corresponding gene (vcrA) was isolated and characterized. Based on the predicted amino acid sequence, VC reductase is a novel {{member of the family}} of corrinoid/iron-sulfur cluster containing reductive dehalogenases. The vcrA gene was found to be cotranscribed with vcrB, encoding a small hydrophobic protein presumably acting as membrane anchor for VC reductase, and vcrC, encoding a protein with similarity to transcriptional regulators of the NosR/NirI family. The vcrAB genes were subsequently found to be present and expressed in other cultures containing VC-respiring Dehalococcoides organisms and could be detected in water samples from a field site contaminated with chlorinated ethenes. Therefore, the vcrA gene identified here may be a useful molecular target for evaluating, predicting, and monitoring in situ reductive VC dehalogenation...|$|R
40|$|We have cloned {{the single}} beta-globin gene from an Italian patient {{who is a}} double {{heterozygote}} for beta o/delta beta o thalassaemia. RNA isolated from nucleated red cells from this patient can be translated in vitro to give detectable levels of A gamma- G gamma and alpha-globin, but no beta-globin. S 1 -mapping transcription studies show that beta-globin mRNA is present at about 1 - 3 % {{of the level of}} alpha- and gamma-globin mRNA. In addition, the expression of this gene has been studied by <b>reversed</b> <b>genetics.</b> SV 40 -plasmid-beta o-globin gene recombinants have been transfected into Hela cells and analysed for beta-globin mRNA. In contrast to the results obtained with mRNA isolated directly from the blood of this patient, in the transfected Hela cells the same level of beta-globin mRNA is seen for the beta o thalassaemic globin gene and for a normal beta-globin gene. To elucidate the nature of the lesion, the entire DNA sequence of the beta-globin gene of this patient has been determined. The sequence shows that this gene contains a termination codon at position 39 (CAG - greater than UAG). Otherwise, there is a remarkable conservation of the entire DNA sequence...|$|R
40|$|Streptomyces reticuli has an {{inducible}} ATP-dependent uptake system specific for cellobiose and cellotriose. By <b>reversed</b> <b>genetics</b> a {{gene cluster}} encoding {{components of a}} binding protein-dependent cellobiose and cellotriose ABC transporter was cloned and sequenced. The deduced gene products comprise a regulatory protein (CebR), a cellobiose binding lipoprotein (CebE), two integral membrane proteins (CebF and CebG), and the NH 2 -terminal part of an intracellular β-glucosidase (BglC). The gene for the ATP binding protein MsiK is not linked to the ceb operon. We have shown earlier that MsiK is part of two different ABC transport systems, one for maltose and one for cellobiose and cellotriose, in S. reticuli and Streptomyces lividans. Transcription of polycistronic cebEFG and bglC mRNAs is induced by cellobiose, whereas the cebR gene is transcribed independently. Immunological experiments showed that CebE is synthesized during growth with cellobiose and that MsiK is produced {{in the presence of}} several sugars at high or moderate levels. The described ABC transporter is the first one of its kind and is the only specific cellobiose/cellotriose uptake system of S. reticuli, since insertional inactivation of the cebE gene prevents high-affinity uptake of cellobiose...|$|R

40|$|Influenza A virus NS 2 protein, {{also called}} nuclear export protein (NEP), {{is crucial for}} the nuclear export of viral ribonucleopro-teins. However, the {{molecular}} mechanisms of NEPmediation in this process remain incompletely understood. A leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES 2) in NEP, located at the predicted N 2 helix of the N-terminal domain, was identified in the present study. NES 2 was demonstrated to be a transferable NES, with its nuclear export activity depending on the nuclear export recep-tor chromosome regionmaintenance 1 (CRM 1) -mediated pathway. The interaction between NEP and CRM 1 is coordinately reg-ulated by both the previously reported NES (NES 1) and now the new NES 2. Deletion of the NES 1 enhances the interaction be-tween NEP and CRM 1, and deletion of the NES 1 and NES 2 motifs completely abolishes this interaction. Moreover, NES 2 interacts with CRM 1 in the mammalian two-hybrid system. Mutant viruses containing NES 2 alterations generated by <b>reversed</b> <b>genetics</b> exhibit reduced viral growth and delay in the nuclear export of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). The NES 2 motif is highly conserved in the influenza A and B viruses. The results demonstrate that leucine-rich NES 2 {{is involved in the}} nuclear ex-port of vRNPs and contributes to the understanding of nucleocytoplasmic transport of influenza virus vRNPs. The transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and thecytoplasm ismediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) em-bedded in the nuclear envelope.

40|$|Pyrococcus furiosus uses {{a variant}} of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway during growth on sugars. All but one of the genes that encode the glycolytic enzymes of P. furiosus have {{previously}} been identified, either by homology searching of its genome or by <b>reversed</b> <b>genetics.</b> We here report the isolation of the missing link of the pyrococcal glycolysis, the phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), which was purified to homogeneity from P. furiosus and biochemically characterized. The P. furiosus PGI, a dimer of identical 23. 5 -kDa subunits, catalyzes the reversible isomerization of glucose 6 -phosphate to fructose 6 -phosphate, with Km values of 1. 99 and 0. 63 mM, respectively. An optimum pH of 7. 0 has been determined in both directions, and at its optimum temperature of 90 °C the enzyme has a half-life of 2. 4 h. The N-terminal sequence was used for the identification of the pgiA gene in the P. furiosus genome. The pgiA transcription start site has been determined, and a monocistronic messenger was detected in P. furiosus during growth on maltose and pyruvate. The pgiA gene was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3). The deduced amino acid sequence of this first archaeal PGI revealed that it is not related to its bacterial and eukaryal counterparts. In contrast, this archaeal PGI shares similarity with the cupin superfamily that consists of a variety of proteins that are generally involved in sugar metabolism in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. As for the P. furiosus PGI, distinct phylogenetic origins have previously been reported for other enzymes from the pyrococcal glycolytic pathway. Apparently, convergent evolution by recruitment of several unique enzymes has resulted in the unique Pyrococcus glycolysis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe NP and M 2 {{proteins}} {{of influenza}} A viruses are cleaved by caspases. M 2 cleavage occurs with {{both human and}} avian viruses, whereas NP cleavage is specific for human strains. In the present study we have modified fowl plaque virus (A/FPV/Rostock/ 34 (H 7  N 1)) by introducing the NP cleavage site and removing the M 2 cleavage site and have analyzed {{the effects of these}} modifications on virus growth and pathogenicity. The viruses generated by <b>reversed</b> <b>genetics</b> were: mutant NPgd which had the NP cleavage site METD↓G 17, recombinant wild type virus and mutant NPdel with the non-cleavable motifs METGG 17 and MET-G 17, respectively, and mutant M 2 nn in which the M 2 cleavage site VDVD↓DG 89 of wild type virus was replaced by the non-cleavable sequence VNVNDG 89. Mutant NPgd replicated in cell cultures and in chicken embryos equally well as wild type virus and mutant NPdel. This observation was in contrast to previous results obtained with the human WSN strain that required caspase cleavage of NP for optimal virus growth. Thus, it appears that acquisition of the NP cleavage site is an adaptive mutation promoting interspecies transmission from an avian to a mammalian host. Like mutant NPgd, mutant M 2 nn virus did not show replication defects in cell culture and in chicken embryos. However, there was a reduction in pathogenicity for chickens, that was moderate with NPgd and dramatic with M 2 nn. Single injections with NPgd and M 2 nn at low doses induced high antibody titers and protected chickens from lethal FPV infection. These results show that a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus can be attenuated by modulating the caspase cleavage sites of NP and M 2 and that these sites should be considered as novel targets for the design of live vaccines...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{interference}} {{through the}} expression of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules has become a very promising tool in <b>reverse</b> mouse <b>genetics</b> as it may allow inexpensive and rapid gene function analysis in vivo. However, the prerequisites for ubiquitous and reproducible shRNA expression are not well defined. Here we show that a single copy shRNA-transgene can mediate body-wide gene silencing in mice when inserted in a defined locus of the genome. The most commonly used promoters for shRNA expression, H 1 and U 6, showed a comparably broad activity in this configuration. Taken together, the results define a novel approach for efficient interference with expression of defined genes in vivo. Moreover, we provide a rapid strategy {{for the production of}} gene knockdown mice combining recombinase mediated cassette exchange and tetraploid blastocyst complementation approaches...|$|R

40|$|Phenotypic {{cell-based}} screening is {{a powerful}} approach to small-molecule discovery, but a major challenge of this strategy lies in determining the intracellular target and mechanism of action (MoA) for validated hits. Here, we show that the small-molecule BRD 0476, a novel suppressor of pancreatic β-cell apoptosis, inhibits interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) -induced Janus kinase 2 (JAK 2) and signal transducer and activation of transcription 1 (STAT 1) signaling to promote β-cell survival. However, unlike common JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors, BRD 0476 inhibits JAK-STAT signaling without suppressing the kinase activity of any JAK. Rather, we identified the deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9 X (USP 9 X) as an intracellular target, using a quantitative proteomic analysis in rat β cells. RNAi-mediated and CRISPR/Cas 9 knockdown mimicked the effects of BRD 0476, and <b>reverse</b> chemical <b>genetics</b> using a known inhibitor of USP 9 X blocked JAK-STAT signaling without suppressing JAK activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of a putative ubiquitination site on JAK 2 mitigated BRD 0476 activity, suggesting a competition between phosphorylation and ubiquitination to explain small-molecule MoA. These results demonstrate that phenotypic screening, followed by comprehensive MoA efforts, can provide novel mechanistic insights into ostensibly well-understood cell signaling pathways. Furthermore, these results uncover USP 9 X as a potential target for regulating JAK 2 activity in cellular inflammation...|$|R

However, the performance of combinatorial chemistry in filling pharmaceutical pipelines has been lower than anticipated and the tide may be turning back to Nature {{in the search for}} new drug candidates. Even though diversity oriented synthesis is now producing molecules that are natural product-like in terms of size and complexity, these molecules have not evolved to interact with biomolecules. Natural products, on the other hand, have evolved to interact with biomolecules, which is why so many can be found in pharmacopoeias. However, the cellular targets and modes of action of these fascinating compounds are seldom known, hindering the drug development process. This review focuses on the emergence of chemical proteomics and reverse chemical proteomics as tools for the discovery of cellular receptors for natural products, thereby generating protein / ligand pairs that will prove useful in identifying new drug targets and new biologically active small molecule scaffolds.
