40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Gravity {{measurements}} {{made during}} 1979 and 1980, combined with existing gravity measurements, provide {{data for the}} interpretation of upper crustal structures relevant to {{the assessment of the}} geothermal potential of south-central Oregon. West of Upper Klamath Lake, free-air gravity anomalies trend north-south and average near 35 mgals. East of Upper Klamath Lake, free-air gravity anomalies trend west to northwest, and average near ten mgals. The complete Bouguer anomaly field exhibits a regional gradient of nearly. 4 mgals/km, which is attributed to the existence of a low-density upper mantle layer beneath the Basin and Range province. The large northwest-trending negative anomaly associated with the Klamath graben suggests a depth of low-density fill of up to 2300 m (7500 feet). The regional gravity field exhibits a broad regional high over the area surrounding Klamath Falls which may be caused by a shallow mantle or a large intrusive body at depth, or may simply be due to intense silicification of the area by thermal waters. The <b>residual</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>field</b> exhibits broad bands of positive anomalies which enclose the negative anomaly associated with the Klamath graben. The easternmost of these broad, positive trends may correspond to the eastern flank of an anticline which may have existed prior to graben faulting. Positive anomalies west of the graben coincide with the Mount McLoughlin lineament. A large positive anomaly located south of Sprague River is interpreted to be a volcanic center and the heat source for thermal waters found in the Sprague River Valley. A two-dimensional cross section near 42 ° 26 ' N. latitude suggests that step-like faults form {{the west side of the}} Klamath graben. The model indicates the presence of a high density body south of Sprague River that is interpreted to be a buried volcanic source for local extrusive volcanic rocks. Northwest-trending gravity anomalies west of Upper Klamath Lake indicate that structural trends of the Basin and Range province extend into the Cascade Mountains, and suggest that a heat source for thermal waters may exist beneath the High Cascades, rather than beneath the areas which exhibit geothermal activity...|$|E
40|$|Gravity and seismic {{refraction}} {{studies were}} undertaken {{in order to}} investigate the geological structure of the Central Volcanic Region. A detailed analysis of density determinations from bore-hole rock samples, three seismic refraction surveys and a spectral analysis of the magnetic anomaly field are described. Interpretation of the observed gravity anomaly fie ld for the Central Volcanic Region is initially undertaken by analytically separating the observed anomaly field into its regional and residual components; the almost entirely negative <b>residual</b> <b>anomaly</b> <b>field</b> is then interpreted in terms of varying thicknesses of near-surface, low-density volcanic rocks. At Mangakino and just west of Taupo, however, {{it is found that}} the calculated gravity anomaly effect of the seismically determined thickness of low-velocity, and hence low-density, volcanic rocks is less negative than the observed residuals; at both locations "secondary residuals" of about - 200 μN/kg remain unexplained. Models are presented that account for these secondary residuals as being due to discrete volumes of low-density molten rhyolite emplaced within the seismic basement. The second method of gravity interpretation used in this study involves modelling all components of the observed gravity anomaly field. This necessitated giving consideration to both the gravity effect of the subducted Pacific plate and to seismic data bearing upon the variation of crustal thickness and mantle density throughout the central North Island. A gravity model for the central North Island is developed for which the important features are: i) The crust of the Central Volcanic Region is deduced to be only about half the normal continental thickness, and underlying the crust is an "anomalous", low-density upper mantle. This finding from the gravity model is supported by the results of a previous study of upper mantle seismic velocities and from the interpretation of a longrange seismic refraction survey carried out within the Region. These seismic data indicate the depth to, and the velocity of the upper mantle beneath the Region to be 15 km and 7. 4 km/s respectively. ii) The positive gravity anomalies that predominate over the western and northwestern North Island can largely be explained by gravity edge-effects associated with variations in the crustal thickness and mantle density within the back-arc areas of the North Island. The gravity model is interpreted as lending support for a previously made proposal that the Region is the site of asymmetric back-arc spreading, and that the crustal rocks now being created are transitional in character between typical oceanic and typical continental...|$|E

40|$|Summary An {{ensemble}} of geophysical techniques: airborne radio echo sounding combined with magnetic and gravity measurements {{as well as}} surface seismic refraction shooting provide high levels of resolution of the sub-ice surface and its material properties and hence geological inferences. <b>Residual</b> magnetic <b>anomaly</b> <b>fields</b> are produced by variations {{in the distribution of}} magnetised material in the uppermost crustal layers. In order to model possible structures and geological units from magnetic surveys magnetic susceptibilities are required. During long-range airborne geophysical missions in the later 1970 s by the Scott Polar Research Institute in conjunction with National Science Foundation and Technical University of Denmark magnetic data were collected over West Antarctica and have been reported by Jankowski (1981). To assist their interpretation magnetic susceptibility measurements were made of rocks specimens from West Antarctic outcrops collected or assembled by Cam Craddock and examples of their use in the modelling the geophysical architecture of West Antarctica are outlined.

40|$|This report {{represents}} {{a continuation of}} gravity work in the Cascade Mountains of Washington supported by the Division of Geology and Earth Resources since 1974. The purpose of this research has been collection of baseline gravity data for use in geothermal resource evaluation. Results of the Division's gravity studies to date are given in Danes and Phillips (1983 a, 1983 b). One of the problems encountered when analyzing gravity data is distinguishing between {{those parts of the}} data that represent geologic structures of interest, and those that do not. In many cases, the features of interest are relatively small, near-surface features, such as those sought in mineral, petroleum, or geothermal exploration. Gravity anomalies caused by such structures may be distorted or masked by anomalies caused by larger, deeper geologic structures. Gravity anomalies caused by relatively shallow, small geologic structures are termed <b>residual</b> <b>anomalies.</b> Those due to broad, deep-seated features can be described as regional anomalies. The purpose of this report is to describe a Fourier analysis method for separating residual and regional gravity anomalies from a complete Bouguer gravity <b>anomaly</b> <b>field.</b> The technique has been applied to gravity data from the Southern Cascade Mountains, Washington. <b>Residual</b> gravity <b>anomaly</b> maps at a scale of 1 : 250, 000 are presented for various regional wavelength filters, and a power spectrum of the frequency components in the South Cascade gravity data is displayed.

40|$|Abstract: Some 100 km {{southwest}} of Tuz Lake in central Turkey {{there are strong}} gravity and magnetic anomalies oriented in a NW-SE direction. The surface geology does not suggest a cause for the anomalies {{although there are some}} small exposures of mafic and ultramafic rocks. The gravity and aeromagnetic <b>anomaly</b> <b>fields</b> are separated into regional and <b>residual</b> <b>anomalies</b> by graphical and planar trend removal, respectively. Three-dimensional models of residual gravity and magnetic anomalies are constructed using an iterative method and depths controlled by power spectrum analysis. A density contrast of 0. 5 g/cm 3 is used with the gravity model. Pseudodensity contrast ranges of 0. 2 - 0. 5 g/cm 3 are used with the magnetic models. The models constructed suggest that different bodies cause the gravity and magnetic anomalies and their bases extend no deeper than the middle of the upper crust. It is suggested that magma was injected into the upper crust at two different stages from the same location. The second stage probably commenced with the formation of high magnetite content igneous rocks when the African plate was closer to the Anatolian plate...|$|R

In this phase, the <b>residual</b> gravity <b>anomaly</b> at each point is estimated in a cross-validation sense (using only gravity anomalies of neighbouring points). The standard deviation {{of the differences between the}} estimated and observed values for all the points is computed.

Besides, subsurface formations of previous geological studies are well expressed through <b>residual</b> <b>anomaly</b> map. Gravity data derived from EGM 2008 expose efficiently the geophysical response of the geology {{in the area of}} study. Located dense materials of volcanic formations like basalts (Telford et al. 1990) are aligned in the same direction with the CVL (N 30 °). This <b>residual</b> <b>anomaly</b> map presents obviously sedimentary basin characterized by low amplitude anomaly such as Douala basin filled by cretaceous deposits (Regnoult 1986; Nguene et al. 1992) and the cretaceous Benue Trough. Positive <b>residual</b> <b>anomaly</b> of Ngambe exposes the garnetiferous gneiss. Abate Essi (2010) studied the density of diverse geological formations of Pan-African Fold Belt and showed that garnetiferous gneiss of Yaoundé Group and especially where there is intense accumulation of garnet called garnetite or garnet rock has high density above 3  g/cm 3. EGM 2008 is therefore useful for geological investigation based on rock density variation. Furthermore, horizontal gradient maxima derived from upward continuation at different heights and deconvolution of Euler enable to characterize some structural linear features. These two last techniques present approximately similar limit depth of features at 10  km. The lineaments highlighted in this work are discussed in the next section.|$|R

40|$|The Bouguer {{correction}} using a mean {{sea level}} reduction datum compensates the gravitational effect {{of the mass of}} the terrain above sea level. This correction generally results in long -wavelength Bouguer gravity anomalies if the mass of the terrain is isostatically compensated. These anomalies correlate with regional elevations, especially in areas with significant regional variations in elevation, such as western North America. The adverse effect of this correlation is that other anomalies of potential interest in a tectonic or geologic analysis may be overshadowed. To circumvent this problem in an analysis of gravity in Arizona, a <b>residual</b> Bouguer gravity <b>anomaly</b> map has been constructed for the state in which a trend surface of the elevation is used as the reduction datum in the Bouguer correction.

The steepness of the magnetic sources suggest possible relative displacement of the blocks of the rock bodies of these magnitudes. The fault correlate with Romanche fracture zone which, if extrapolated into Nigerian landmass will pass through the area diagonally in a NE-SW striking direction...|$|R
40|$|The space {{distribution}} of the magnetic <b>anomaly</b> <b>field</b> for the Pacific Ocean is obtained from data of the satellite MAGSAT. A number of long-wavelength magnetic anomalies of the region are identified. A spectrum analysis {{of a number of}} profiles of the <b>anomaly</b> <b>field</b> is performed disclosing typical scales of such anomalies. The wave transform of the anomaly magnetic profiles reveals and explicitly exposes the structure of the considered profile. A schematic complex cross-section is constructed, which demonstrates that the satellite data may be used {{in the study of the}} magnetic anomaly...|$|R
