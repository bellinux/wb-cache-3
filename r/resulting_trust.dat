5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust,</b> but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E

5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Trusts {{where the}} {{doctrine}} is applicable {{are divided into}} two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose has failed after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the redirection of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, {{since there is no}} question of allowing the settlor's next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds should be subject to cy-près or returned to the estate in a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust.</b> This is decided based on the charitable intention of the settlor, something determined on the facts of each individual case.|$|E

25|$|No {{declaration}} of trust is the most straightforward form of <b>resulting</b> <b>trust,</b> and is created when a trust is created, but the settlor does not give the form in which the property is to be held. For example, the settlor might give property to the beneficiary to hold for life, but fail to explain what is {{to happen to the}} property when the holder dies. When this occurs, the property is held on <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> for the settlor, as in Vandervell v IRC. This also occurs where a trust is formed over property which requires formality, but is improperly created (for example, a land transfer that does not adhere to the Law of Property Act 1925).|$|E

25|$|A <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> {{will also}} be found where the {{purposes}} of a trust have been completed, but there is excess property left over; for example, a trust by a settlor to provide for his children's university education. Judges and academics disagree over what should happen to the property; possibilities are {{that it should be}} held for the donors, that it should be held for the beneficiaries (as the donors intended to make an irrevocable gift) or that it should be given to the Crown as bona vacantia. A fourth suggestion is that the trustees take the surplus, as in Re Foord. The general rule was set out in Re Trusts of the Abbot Fund, where it was decided that excess funds will be held on <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> for the settlor. There are exceptions to this rule; the general rule is put aside if the court can find intention to benefit specific individuals, as in Re Osoba.|$|E
25|$|Resulting trust: A <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> {{is a form}} of {{implied trust}} which occurs where (1) a trust fails, wholly or in part, as a result of which the settlor becomes {{entitled}} to the assets; or (2) a voluntary payment is made by A to B in circumstances which do not suggest gifting. B becomes the resulting trustee of A's payment.|$|E
25|$|Trusts may {{be created}} by the {{expressed}} intentions of the settlor (express trusts) or they may {{be created by}} operation of law known as implied trusts. An implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties. Implied trusts are divided into two categories: resulting and constructive. A <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties, but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent. A constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties, regardless of their intentions.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, Quistclose trusts have {{sometimes}} been {{considered to be}} purpose trusts, but the modern view {{is that they are}} <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> to the settlor subject to a power to dispose of the assets in a predetermined fashion.

50|$|Where a {{settlement}} of property on a third party trustee by a settlor fails, the property is usually said to be held on <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> for the settlor. However, if a settlor validly transfers property to a third party, and the words used are held not to create a trust, the usual rule is that the donee take the property absolutely.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In 1910 Frederic Maitland, in {{his famous}} lectures on Equity, {{described}} <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> as follows: [...] "I have made a trustee for somebody, and a trustee he must be - if for no one else then for me or my representatives". It remains controversial whether they respond to unjust enrichment, or {{what would have been}} intended by the parties.|$|R
25|$|Linked to this {{category}} {{is the problem}} of unincorporated associations. Unincorporated associations cannot hold rights (chattels or land) on their own account. When they dissolve, the question is then what to do with property that has been transferred to the association. The traditional view, as laid out in Re West Sussex Constabulary's Widows, Children and Benevolent (1930) Fund Trusts, is that the members of the association hold these rights on purpose trust. Where the money was raised from identified individuals, the property should be held on <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> for donors upon the failure of the purpose trust. Where it is impossible or impractical, the property should be passed to the Crown as bona vacantia. The more modern view developed from Walton J's judgment in Re Bucks Constabulary Benevolent Fund. This is that dissolving a society and distributing property to its members is a matter of contract, not trusts law. As such, the contract between the association's members should be the deciding factor in how the property is to be distributed, and {{there is no need to}} involve resulting trusts. If the contractual provisions identify how to distribute property, they will be followed; if not, the property will be distributed according to an implied term, usually in equal shares.|$|E
500|$|Two further {{problems}} are apparent {{when considering the}} fraud theory {{in the context of}} half-secret trusts. Since the will mentions the trust, it is impossible for the trustee to deny the existence of the trust. Whether or not the intended beneficiaries can be ascertained, in case of inter vivo transaction, the trust-beneficiary cannot benefit personally and any meaning of fraud seems apparent because fraud requires an intention to act dishonestly. It appears to create an alternative route: the trustee may bring false oral testimony in favour of a third party who was not the intended beneficiary, a party that cannot benefit if the law did not uphold half-secret trusts in conclusion but it could operate without court's interference. Secondly, a half-secret trust ought to fail for uncertainty, being a trust with no terms, with a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> to the residuary legatee. Under the rule of three uncertainties in private trust, half or fully secretly trust ought to fail because of lack of intentional element. Those in favour of its enforcement must therefore observe the imposition of <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> as required under three certainties rule, and the [...] "fraud" [...] theory seems insufficient to do so, since there is no sublet and significant impact for dishonest act and if otherwise fraud can be upheld; and therefore no conduct {{on the part of the}} trustee to warrant it. The deceased's intended disposition remains imperfectly constituted and the intended beneficiary's claim is thus weaker than the residuary legatee's. Whilst one response has been to suggest that whether a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> or enforcement of the secret trust is most appropriate remedy is a question for the courts, subsequent cases have typically defined the automatic <b>resulting</b> <b>trust,</b> as in this case, as operating as a matter of law and not a question for the courts, and this should be settled by parliament legislation.|$|E
500|$|Cases {{of initial}} failure are where, {{rather than an}} {{established}} charitable trust failing, a gift has failed {{at the moment of}} its creation by having an invalid purpose. This raises different questions, as {{it is a matter of}} deciding [...] "has the original charitable gift failed, and, if it has, can the money be applied cy-près or must it go on <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> to the settlor's estate"? ...|$|E
40|$|The {{equitable}} {{doctrine of}} <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> plays {{a significant role}} in defining and allocating the rights and responsibilities of adult children and older adult parents who are co-holders of joint bank accounts. Where equity deems the adult child to be a resulting trustee for their parent, it also imposes a rule that the adult child must follow the directions of the older adult, that is, a beneficiary-direction rule. This rule suffices to hold to account a financially abusive adult child co-holder, but it appears to preclude a beneficiary-protection power, that is, a power of an honest adult child co-holder to take protective action, against the wishes of the older adult, to safeguard the parent from financial abuse by others. This article explores, from a Canadian perspective, but with comparative aspects, the preference of equity for a beneficiary-direction rule over a beneficiary-protection power in the context of joint bank account <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts.</b> While it is contended that it is possible for equity to recognize a beneficiary-protection power, by analogizing such <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> to express trusts, it is ultimately concluded that the preference for the beneficiary-direction rule is reasonable. That conclusion is reached on the basis of considerations of precedent and policy that give rise to a number of interconnected barriers to this analogy. However, since it can be anticipated that a need for protective action might arise, it is argued that equity should respect an express grant of protective power. This, in turn, has implications for lawyers and other advisors on financial affairs and related legal matters. Peer reviewe...|$|R
25|$|For {{a living}} trust, the grantor may retain {{some level of}} control to the trust, such by {{appointment}} as protector under the trust instrument. Living trusts also, in practical terms, tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations.

5000|$|... #Caption: The Corpus Juris Civilis (534 AD) of Justinian I (depicted left) {{followed}} Gaius' Institutes (170 AD) by categorising {{the law of}} obligations into contracts, delicts, and [...] "miscellaneous" [...] others. Unjust enrichment {{was slowly}} seen as a third category, but it is controversial whether proprietary rights arise to reverse it. <b>Resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> and some constructive trusts are usually conceptualised as responding to unjust enrichment.|$|R
500|$|Since {{allowing}} the {{trustee of the}} will to retain the property {{is at the heart}} of the [...] "fraud", it is not clear why courts have considered the appropriate remedy to recognise a trust on behalf of others, rather than a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> in favour of the estate (the residuary legatee). To this it has been argued that, since the testator is dead, a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> is often reversing the beneficiary's claims since the testator cannot make any attempt to revoke or undo the trust terms. Save in case of a will and except the plain reading of clauses within the will, having admitted external evidence as operating under the proper introduction of the doctrine of incorporation by reference, a conclusive claim that it is necessary to observe further the formality requirement cannot be disregarded, because Will Act clearly set out the requirements of property transfer in case of failure has to be based on result trust that a party ultimately intended. The enforcement of the secret trust as a response to perceived fraud also opens the door to a further form of deceit, whereby the trustee funnels the trust monies to the wrong beneficiary. In light of evidential burden of proof, when establishing the identity of the secret beneficiary, ...|$|E
2500|$|A <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> {{is usually}} {{recognised}} when {{one person has}} given property to another person without the intention to benefit them. The recipient will be declared by the court to be a [...] "resulting trustee" [...] so that the equitable property right returns to the person it came from. For some time, the courts of equity required proof of a positive intention before they would acknowledge the passing of a gift, primarily {{as a way to}} prevent fraud. If one person transferred property to another, unless there was positive evidence that {{it was meant to be}} a gift, it would be presumed that the recipient held the property on trust for the transferee. It was also recognised that if money was transferred as part of the purchase of land or a house, the transferee would acquire an equitable interest in the land under a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust.</b> On the other hand, if evidence clearly showed a gift was intended, then a gift would be acknowledged. In Fowkes v Pascoe, an old lady named Mrs Baker had bought Mr Pascoe some company stocks, because she had become endeared to him and treated him like a grandson. When she died, the executor, Mr Fowkes, argued that Mr Pascoe held the stocks on <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> for the estate, but the Court of Appeal said the fact that the lady had put the stocks in Mr Pascoe's name was absolutely conclusive. The presumption of a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> was rebutted.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, when {{a person}} sought to rebut presumptions but was {{required}} to rely on an illegal act to prove that a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> was intended, the equitable maxim that [...] "he who comes to equity must come with clean hands" [...] was applied; the presumption would take effect, and no <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> would be created, as in Mucklestone v Brown. In addition, as in Gascoigne v Gascoigne, where {{the purpose of the}} transfer involves illegality, the courts will not uphold it as a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust.</b> This rule was subtly modified by the House of Lords decision in Tinsley v Milligan. Tinsley and Milligan had jointly purchased a house to run as a business, and both accepted that it had been bought to own jointly. Only Tinsley was registered as the owner, however, so that Milligan (with Tinsley's knowledge) could claim state benefits. The House of Lords decided that Milligan could claim an equitable interest, since it was the contribution to the purchase price (a lawful act) which she was relying on, not the associated fraud (an illegal act). Although the purpose of the initial registration had been illegal, the purpose of the purchase itself had not.|$|E
5000|$|One {{usage of}} the term [...] "fiduciary trust" [...] is to {{distinguish}} the word [...] "trust" [...] from usage in general contexts where it does not imply a trustee-beneficiary relationship, and also sometimes to distinguish it from implied trusts (such as some constructive <b>trusts</b> and some <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts)</b> in which the trustee does not have express intent of a major fiduciary duty involving nontrivial discretion {{on the part of}} the trustee.|$|R
