The target of specifying strategic preferences of <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> has been to find the correct way of disposal or beneficial use of sludge. Material and methods: In this study, to select the best alternative for reuse of wastewater sludge two systematic methods are introduced, which four alternatives for <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> (use in agriculture, use in green space, biogas, desert combat) are introduced and they are compared by four main parameters including: 1 - physicochemical 2 -biological 3 - economic, social and cultural, and 4 - environmental pollution situation, that each contains some criteria. In this study, first each of the related parameters and criteria are compared by the expert groups of and through questionnaire. Then these weights are entered into Expert Choice software for the analyze of AHP model and paired comparisons and weightings have been done on the related parameters and criteria. Ultimately, the output of the software is entered into TOPSIS software for the analyze of TOPSIS model until the best alternative is selected. Results: sludge of Ardabil municipal wastewater treatment plant, according to standards and EPA regulations is eligible to class B, and due to the chemical in terms of heavy metals have special (excellent) quality and contains considerable quantities of organic substance, nutrients and micronutrients which indicates the fertilizer value of the sludge.

Therefore, the alternate or suitable solution is <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> in an ecofriendly approach. Biotechnology is an interesting tool to add value to the processes involved in wastewater and wastewater sludge disposal/reuse. In this context, a study was carried out on thermophilic bacterial strains that produce thermostable proteases. The bacterial strains were first isolated from municipal wastewater sludge. In contrast to the conventional strains used in industries, like Bacillus sp., the new strains were Gram-Negative type. In semi-synthetic medium, a maximal protease activity of 5. 25 IU/ml (International Unit per ml) was obtained at a pH of 8. 2 and at a temperature of 60 oC, which {{is higher than the}} stability temperature of 37 °C for a similar protease obtained from the conventional producer Bacillus licheniformis. Moreover, growth and protease activity of the strains were tested in wastewater sludge. It is expected that the complexity of sludge could stimulate/enhance the protease production and their characteristics. In conclusion, reuse of wastewater sludge will help to reduce their quantity as well as the value-added products produced will replace chemical products used in industries...|$|E

After composting the sludge can be reused as fertiliser and soil conditioner in agriculture. Compared to landfilling and incineration, utilisation of sludge-compost is a more sustainable treatment because it recycles both nutrients and organic matter. However the high levels of heavy metals in sludge frequently prevent the <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> compost in agriculture. The extraction of heavy metals from the sludge before composting is therefore a necessary step to achieve a more sustainable sludge treatment. Extraction of heavy metals by inorganic acids and complexing agents has severe drawbacks. Organic acids could be an attractive extracting agent because the extraction can be performed at mildly acidic conditions (pH 3 - 5) and they are biologically degradable. The extraction was studied for heavy metals Cu and Zn and for competing metals Ca and Fe. The rate of extraction increases for increasing temperature and citric acid concentration. Cu can be extracted for 60 - 70 nd Zn for 90 - 100 ␋y citric acid at pH 3 - 4.

40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental TechnologyTreatment of {{municipal}} wastewater produces {{large quantities of}} sludge that represents a cost for the individual wastewater treatment plant. Proper sludge treatment enables <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge,</b> possibly as fertilizers. Fertilizer application of sludge is desirable since it improves the organic material reconstitution of the soil and implies recycling of nutrients. Negative aspects of sludge reuse are accumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the sludge, and fertilizers based on sludge can therefore {{be a source of}} pollution. At present, there are only regulations regarding heavy metals (HMs) for sludge reuse in Norway, however, more stringent requirements is inevitable as the European Union {{is currently working on a}} document on sludge and sludge utilization where maximum levels of other pollutants in fertilizers, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), will be determined. In this thesis, fate of POPs during the processes leading to bio pellets production at the municipal wastewater treatment plant Sentralrenseanlegg Nord-Jæren (SNJ) was examined. Fate of POPs and HMs in anaerobic digesters was determined based on modeling of PAH’s partitioning between sludge particles and water phase using the software AQUASIM. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the distribution of POPs and HMs in the processes of centrifugation and drying. Analyses of samples of spiked sludge, dewatered sludge, reject water, and dried sludge were done externally by Eurofins. Modeling of partitioning of PAHs between sludge and surrounding aqueous phase showed an approxumate setting of equilibrium within the first 10 hours after which almost all of the PAHs were found sorbed to the sludge. Experimental work showed that during the processes of dewatering THC (total hydrocarbon), PAH, PCB, and HM were all tightly bound to sludge whereas BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) was found to follow the reject water. During drying almost all remaining BTEX evaporated whereas THC, PAH, PCB, and HM were found in elevated quantities in the dried sludge, i. e. bio pellets...|$|E

Environmental advantages <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> consist <b>of,</b> application <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use <b>of</b> Sewage <b>Sludge,</b> with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs <b>of</b> parasitic worms. <b>Sludge</b> also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits <b>of</b> <b>reusing</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> from use <b>of</b> organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension <b>of</b> benefits <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish.

40|$|Contaminants of {{emerging}} concern are increasing {{in all the}} ecosystems, due to the unintentional or intentional release into the environment of new molecules/compounds or to a new employment and disposal of complex and potentially polluted matrices. In this respect, the <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> from wastewater treatment plants in farming soils is recognized as a cost-effective practice to dispose of a byproduct, that, after specific treatments and maturation, can be provided as a fertilizer, rich in organic matter and nutrients (1). On the other hand, due to the uncertainty of its contents not thoroughly tested for safety, sludge can result a possible sink of unknown priority pollutants {{as well as of}} not commonly monitored chemicals, such as nanoparticles (NPs) (2). The latter emerging contaminants are becoming a worldwide problem: nanotechnologies are being gradually more employed in all sectors of technology and innovation, but their effects on living organisms are not yet fully clear and unambiguously interpretable (3). Besides, NPs behavior is poorly estimated in the different environmental matrices, especially in agricultural soils. In such complex matrices, the bioavailability of the different nanomaterials frequently is not predictable, for the tendency of NPs to aggregate, to adsorb/precipitate on solid phase, as well as to be coated by organic molecules (4). In addition, the overall picture of their possible interactions with crop plants and with food chains {{is not at all clear}} (5). In the present work we aimed to investigate the effects of TiO 2 NPs in a sludge amended agricultural soil to evaluate the growth and development of the crop Pisum sativum L. at microcosm scale under long term exposure, possibly miming an environmental occurrence. TiO 2 was spiked in two different concentrations in the form of bulk material or of NPs and by using the two main crystal forms (anatase and rutile), applied singularly or in a mixture of the two. Electron microscopy imaging studies allowed us to visualize internalized NPs in the different sub-cellular compartments of the root tissues and their effects on cell ultrastructure. Synchrotron studies demonstrated that both titanium crystal forms, especially anatase, were taken up and moved to the vascular system. Studies dealing with the possible induction of oxidative stress were performed by in situ histochemical techniques and by biochemical approach. The potential fertilized value of the sludge-amended agricultural soil seemed to have no beneficial effects on the plant, but rather to induce disturbance at different levels for the selected crop. The addition of NPs in the sludge-amended soil marked oxidative damages in P. sativum. This result was more pronounced at the lowest NPs concentration and this fact could be probably related to the low tendency of the diluted NPs suspension to form homo- and heteroaggregates in a complex matrix, with a consequent greater bioavailability. In our experimental system, the most adverse effects on plants were mainly recorded following exposure with anatase crystal form, alone or mixed with rutile as well as in the presence of the corresponding bulk material. These findings rise some reflections on fertilization practices of agricultural soils by treated sludge and on the exploitation of nanomaterials, which safety must be carefully evaluated, in order to establish precise regulation over their use, confinement and environmental disposal...|$|E
40|$|Environmental and {{legislative}} constraints regarding sludge disposal, {{such as its}} application on agricultural land, stimulate {{research in this area}}. Since municipalities are responsible for sludge disposal and finance it from taxpayers’ money, cost is the major constraint in providing this service. Therefore, research in this area has to provide economically viable solutions. The Autothermal Thermophilic Aerobic Digestion (ATAD) process is one practical solution that enables the <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> in agriculture, though its high energy demand reduces its appeal. One of the main attractiveness of ATAD process is its stability and low sensitivity to changeable operating conditions. Our theory is that the cost efficiency of ATAD process could be enhanced by improving its energy performance and therefore operating cost attractiveness. Thus, the main objective of the research was to improve the energy efficiency of the ATAD sludge treatment process. The hypothesis of certain modifications applied to the ATAD process to increase its operational temperature can enhance its energy efficiency was investigated. This thesis answered the question whether the energy efficiency of the ATAD process can be improved by increasing the operating temperature in the reactors, e. g. reducing and/or eliminating the thermal shock. This research further deepened the understanding of the process and indicated areas of improvements for design and operation. It established, through analysis, redesign options and best operation conditions leading to a more energy efficient ATAD process. The dynamic mathematical model used is capable of predicting the rate of volatile solids degradation and the temperature of the sludge in the reactors, therefore the compliance with legislation (pasteurisation and stabilisation criteria) can be assessed. The applicability of the ATAD dynamic mathematical model on a full-scale was demonstrated. It was proven to give a more realistic picture of process performance than the current design guidelines. Recommendations for improving the existing process were proposed and verified by the ATAD mathematical model. Modifications made to the operational circumstances, such as changing the feeding pattern (feeding volume and frequency), changing the characteristics of the feed sludge, such as its concentration or temperature (achieved by heat integration) and changing the characteristics of the air supplied, such as its temperature; and combination of the above listed solutions were analysed. This project has proven that the design of the ATAD system could be further improved with the recommendation such as heat integration and changed feeding pattern. The results include: • More stable and steady operation. • The proposed improvements lead to reduced retention time, which also reduces the need for aeration and mixing energy – ultimately, this improves energy efficiency as it reduces the electricity needs by 25 % for running the system for a certain throughput. A tool which can be utilized to evaluate the different ATAD systems has been provided. The model’s potential is not restricted to a tool for evaluation of process modifications from an energy efficiency perspective. It can be used along different objectives and at different stages of ATAD systems’ life span, such as design, operation and control; and even as a teaching tool. This research further deepened the understanding of the process and indicated areas of improvements for design and operation and also opens the doors for further research in this area. Improvements can lead to ATAD’s wider acceptance in the wastewater treatment field and its more extensive use in Ireland and around the globe...|$|E

A “tidal flow” strategy was employed to enhance the wetland aeration to stimulate organic pollutants and N oxidation while the “step feed” operation was adopted to supply the necessary amount of carbon source for denitrification. The results reveal that alum sludge acted as P adsorbent can secure the P removal. Meanwhile, high removals of ammoniacal-nitrogen and organic matters can also be obtained due to the active bacteria attached growth on the alum sludge surface.

All the results conclusively show that ageing time has insignificant effect on the structure and properties of the dewatered alum sludge and thus the phosphate adsorption capacity <b>of</b> the alum <b>sludge</b> remains insignificant change during the ageing...|$|R
40|$|Disposal <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> from {{waste water}} {{treatment}} plants is a serious environmental problem of increasing magnitude. Waste water treatment generates as much as 70 g of dry solids per capita per day. Although one of the disposal solutions for this waste is through incineration, still almost 30 % <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> solids remain as ash. This paper presents results related to <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> ash in concrete. The sludge was characterised for chemical composition (X-ray flourescence analysis), crystalline phases (X-ray diffraction analysis) and pozzolanic activity. The effects of incineration on crystal phases <b>of</b> the dry <b>sludge</b> were investigated. Two water/cement (W/C) ratios (0. 55 and 0. 45) and three sludge ash percentages (5 %, 10 % and 20 %) per cement mass were used as filler. The mechanical performance <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> ash concrete (SSAC) at different curing ages (3, 7, 28 and 90 days) was assessed by means of mechanical tests and capillary water absorption. Results show that sewage sludge ash leads {{to a reduction in}} density and mechanical strength and to an increase in capillary water absorption. Results also show that SSAC with 20 % <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> ash and W/C= 0. 45 has a 28 day compressive strength of almost 30 MPa. SSAC with a <b>sludge</b> ash contents <b>of</b> 5 % and 10 % has the same capillary water absorption coefficient as the control concrete; as for the concrete mixtures with 20 % sludge ash content, the capillary water absorption is higher but in line with C 20 / 25 strength class concretes performance...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the glyphosate adsorption by water treatment residual (termed as alum sludge) in dewatered form (DAS) and liquid form (LAS). Batch adsorption tests were carried out with DAS at different pH, particle size and DAS mass. Standard jar tests were conducted with LAS at two different concentrations (3 g/l and 5 g/l) for glyphosate adsorption. Thereafter, the glyphosate-enriched LAS (after adsorption tests) was subjected to sludge conditioning procedure with polymer LT 25 as conditioner to explore any possible further glyphosate reduction. The results indicate that alum sludge has the high adsorption capacity of 85. 9 mg/g for DAS and 113. 6 mg/g for LAS. This demonstrated the potential <b>of</b> the alum <b>sludge</b> to be an efficient and cost-effective adsorbent for glyphosate removal in comparison with other adsorbents, such as soils, humic substances, clay minerals, and layered double hydroxides (LDH). The polymer conditioning of the glyphosate-enriched LAS cannot bring about the further glyphosate reduction in the supernatant of the dewatered LAS. Overall, this study promotes the beneficial <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> alum <b>sludge</b> in wide range of pollutant control in environmental engineering...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Microalgal {{heterotrophic}} bioreactors are {{a potential}} technological development that can convert organic matter, {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} of wastewaters into a biomass suitable for energy production. The aim of this work was to evaluate the performance of microalgal heterotrophic bioreactors in the secondary treatment of cattle-slaughterhouse wastewater and the <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> microalgal <b>sludge</b> for biodiesel production. The experiments were performed in a bubble column bioreactor using the microalgae Phormidium sp. Heterotrophic microalgal biore-actors removed 90 % of the chemical oxygen demand, 57 % of total nitrogen and 52 % of total phosphorus. Substantial microalgal sludge is produced in the process (substrate yield coefficient of 0. 43 mgsludge mgchemical oxygen demand − 1), resulting in a biomass with high potential for producing biodiesel (ester content of more than 99 %, cetane number of 55, iodine value of 73. 5 giodine 100 g− 1, unsaturation degree of ~ 75 % and a {{cold filter plugging point}} of 5 ºC) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This work reports some {{reflections}} {{about the}} European and Italian regulation on sewage sludge. In Europe, the progressive augment {{of the production}} <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> from municipal wastewater treatment plants has recently led to a growing attention about management {{of this type of}} solid matrix. European Directives and Italian guidelines stimulated <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> on agricultural soils or in composting facto-ries encouraging the restitution to the biogeochemical natural cycles of recovered material. Nevertheless current Italian law on wastes suggests that sewage sludge must be subjected to the general regulation of waste and sometime public opin-ion suspect about the sludge recovery practice prevails on the convincement concerning a more convenient waste man-agement. Fundamental policy of constituting European Union regulation on sewage sludge promotes agricultural reuse when sludge has transformed according to conventional and advanced treatments, this means that a well defined and standardized norm for characterization and treatment is necessary. In the year 2000, the 3 rd draft of “Working document on sludge ” was developed with the aim to promote the use <b>of</b> sew-age <b>sludge</b> in agriculture, to ensure safety of land application and to harmonize sludge quality standards. This document can be considered an optimum basis to develop further guidelines considering a new approach to the field. The aim is to obtain without delay a final draft to introduce a European shared prospective in sewage sludge management which is every time stimulated and directed by certain and actual regulations. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{management}} <b>of</b> residual <b>sludge</b> is {{a current}} {{environmental and economic}} problem for many Italian and Swiss dimensional stone quarries. It {{may be possible to}} transfer sludge to local treatment plants where sludge could be treated in order to ensure its reuse. Sludge production is about: 70. 000 t/year for Ossola Valley Basin, 16. 000 t/year for Luserna Stone District and 8 - 10. 000 t/year for Canton Ticino. This paper outlines research that has developed a method to convert residual sludge into loam that can be reused for as a fertile substrata for quarry remediation. Case studies in Val d'Ossola, Luserna stone and Canton Ticino basins describe the <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> this <b>sludge.</b> It is not feasible to use sludges for farming applications due to their granulometry and physio-chemical nature, as well as their probable contamination brought about by the quarry processing (e. g. TPH: C 10 -C 40). Technological advances have enabled the composting of a mix <b>of</b> residual <b>sludge</b> with green material and nutrients. Bioremediation of this material takes approximately 12 weeks. Initial results indicate that the total petroleum hydrocarbons (range C 10 -C 40) in the dry sludge were reduced by 70 % and that the CFU (colonies forming units) increased within 10 weeks. Compost maturity and agronomical parameters indicate that the product is similar to standard forest soil. The aim of the paper is to indicate the benefit <b>of</b> treating quarry <b>sludge</b> waste...|$|R
