25|$|Assam has {{wildlife}} sanctuaries, {{the most}} prominent of which are two UNESCO World Heritage sites-the Kaziranga National Park, {{on the bank of the}} Brahmaputra River, and the Manas Wildlife Sanctuary, near the border with Bhutan. The Kaziranga is a refuge for the fast-disappearing Indian one-horned rhinoceros. The state is the last refuge for numerous other endangered and threatened species including the white-winged wood duck or deohanh, Bengal florican, black-breasted parrotbill, red-headed vulture, white-rumped vulture, greater adjutant, Jerdon's babbler, <b>rufous-necked</b> <b>hornbill,</b> Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, pygmy hog, gaur, wild water buffalo, Indian hog deer, hoolock gibbon, golden langur, capped langur, barasingha, Ganges river dolphin, Barca snakehead, Ganges shark, Burmese python, brahminy river turtle, black pond turtle, Asian forest tortoise, and Assam roofed turtle. Threatened species that are extinct in Assam include the gharial, a critically endangered fish-eating crocodilian, and the pink-headed duck (which may be extinct worldwide). For the state bird, the white-winged wood duck, Assam is a globally important area. In addition to the above, there are three other National Parks in Assam namely Dibru Saikhowa National Park, Nameri National Park and the Orang National Park.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conservation}} area or habitat in the Phobhjikha Valley, established in 2003 has, {{not only the}} black-necked cranes, but also 13 other vulnerable species such as <b>rufous-necked</b> <b>hornbill</b> Aceros nipalensis, chestnut-breasted partridge Arborophila mandellii, Pallas's fish eagle Haliaeetus leucoryphus, nuthatch Sitta Formosa, wood snipe Gallinago nemoricola, Blyth's tragopan Tragopan blythii, greater spotted eagle Clanga clanga, imperial eagle Aquila heliaca, Baer's pochard Aythya baeri, Hodgson's bushchat Saxicola insignis, dark-rumped swift Apus acuticauda, and grey-crowned prinia Prinia cinereocapilla. The black-necked cranes arrive in this valley in late October and depart in mid February. They feed on the particular type of dwarf bamboos that grow in the wetlands of the valley. The thick grasslands of wetlands are also grazing grounds for {{a large number of}} cattle and horses during the summer months that helps the growth of the tender bamboo shoots on which the cranes feed later during the winter season. There were suggestions that the wetlands be drained and used to grow cash crops such as potatoes, which is also the main crop of the valley. Such an action would have deprived the cranes of their main feeding centres. However, Palje [...] "Benjie" [...] Dorji, former Chief Justice of Bhutan, former Minister for Environment and uncle of the present King of Bhutan, as the Chairman of the Royal Bhutan Society and as founder of the Black-necked Conservation Programme prevailed on the Government of Bhutan to drop the proposal to drain the wetlands of the Phobjika Valley to create farms to grow cash rich seed potatoes.|$|E

5000|$|Royal Manas National Park in {{southern}} Bhutan, considered the national heritage of Bhutan, was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1996 and subsequently {{raised to the}} status of a national park in 1993. Covering an area of 9938.54 km2, the area is forested to the extent of 92% and is a well-preserved Eastern Himalayan ecosystem. The park is bounded on its north by the Black Mountain National Park and the Manas Tiger Reserve on its South in India. Within Bhutan, biological corridors linked with the park are the Thrumshingla National Park in the North, Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary in the West, and Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary in the East. As researched so far, the park has a large diversity of tropical grasslands, temperate moist forests, alpine meadows, and scrublands. The various flora and fauna identified in the park are 45 species of mammals, 366 species of birds and 900 species of vascular plants. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is actively working on a conservation management plan in association with local wildlife authorities to preserve and protect this national heritage.Some of the important faunal species identified are: the royal Bengal tiger, elephant, gaur (Bos gaurus), four rare species of golden langur (Trachypithecus geei), pygmy hog (Sus salvanius), hispid hare (Caprolagus hispidus), greater one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and wild Asiatic water buffalo (Bubalus arnee). There are 362 species of birds, out of which four species of <b>hornbills</b> (<b>rufous-necked,</b> wreathed, pied and great Indian) have been recorded. Apart from the Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) other aquan species identified in the river are the deep bodied mahseer (Tor tor), golden mahseer (Tor putitora), and chocolate mahseer or katle (Acrossocheilus hexangonolepis). Five thousand people live within the park limits in several villages. Tigers, the most revered animal in Bhutan, are estimated to number about 100 and are mostly in this national park and the neighbouring Manas National Park in India ...|$|R

50|$|While {{predominantly}} a bird of ridged and hilly forests, chiefly broadleaved forests at altitudes of 150 - 2200 m, it {{has also}} been recorded in dry woodland. The nesting period is from March to June, the trees preferred are tall and have broad girths. There is evidence to suggest the <b>rufous-necked</b> <b>hornbill</b> communities move seasonally between one forested area to another to avail of the differing abundance of fruiting trees due to local conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{forests are}} home to over 500 species of bird some of which migrate to the higher Himalayas in the hot summer. There are twelve near-endemic bird species {{as well as the}} {{strictly}} endemic rufous-throated wren-babbler. A number of bird species especially pheasant, tragopan and hornbill are easily threatened by changes to their habitat and those found here include the globally threatened <b>rufous-necked</b> <b>hornbill</b> (Aceros nipalensis), Sclater's monal (Lophophorus sclateri), white-bellied heron (Ardea insignis), Blyth's tragopan (Tragopan blythii) and Ward's trogon (Harpactes wardi).|$|E

50|$|As for {{the other}} Asian {{hornbill}} species, Buceros and Rhinoplax are each other's closest relatives, Anorrhinus {{is part of a}} clade that has Ocyceros and Anthracoceros as sister taxa, and Aceros, Rhyticeros, and Penelopides form another clade. However, according to this study, Aceros is polyphyletic; the Rufous-headed hornbill, Writhed hornbill, and Wrinkled hornbill form a clade with the Sulawesi hornbill, and are in turn more closely related to Penelopides. These four species have been classified in a separate genus, Rhabdotorrhinus. Similarly, the Knobbed hornbill is more closely related to Rhyticeros, leaving the <b>Rufous-necked</b> <b>hornbill</b> {{the only member of the}} genus Aceros.|$|E

50|$|None of the African {{species of}} {{hornbills}} are seriously threatened, but many Asian hornbills {{are threatened by}} hunting and habitat loss, as they tend to require primary forest. Among these threatened species, only the plain-pouched hornbill and <b>rufous-necked</b> <b>hornbill</b> are found on the Asian mainland; all others are insular in their distribution. In the Philippines alone, one species (the Palawan hornbill) is vulnerable, and two species (the Mindoro and Visayan hornbills) are endangered. The only critically endangered hornbills, the rufous-headed hornbill and the Sulu hornbill, are also restricted to the Philippines. The latter species {{is one of the}} world's rarest birds, with only 20 breeding pairs or 40 mature individuals, and faces imminent extinction. The Ticao hornbill, a subspecies of the Visayan hornbill, is probably already extinct.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the earlier}} {{papers on the}} birds of Namdapha was {{published}} in 1990. The park has about 425 bird species with many more to be recorded from work in the higher areas. There are five species of hornbills recorded from the area. Several species of rare wren-babblers have been recorded in Namdapha. Other bird groups include laughing thrushes, parrotbills, fulvettas, shrike babblers and scimitar babblers. The snowythroated babbler is a rare species of babbler found only in the Patkai and Mishmi hills and nearby areas in Northern Myanmar, is found in Namdapha.

40|$|The loss of {{tropical}} forests and associated biodiversity {{is a global}} concern. Conservation efforts in tropical countries such as India have mostly focused on state-administered protected areas despite the existence of vast tracts of forest outside these areas. We studied hornbills (Bucerotidae), an ecologically important vertebrate group and a flagship for tropical forest conservation, to assess the importance of forests outside protected areas in Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India. We conducted a state-wide survey to record encounters with hornbills in seven protected areas, six state-managed reserved forests and six community-managed unclassed forests. We estimated the density of hornbills in one protected area, four reserved forests and two unclassed forests in eastern Arunachal Pradesh. The state-wide survey showed that the mean rate of encounter of rufous-necked hornbills Aceros nipalensis was four times higher in protected areas than in reserved forests and 22 times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The mean rate of encounter of wreathed hornbills Rhyticeros undulatus was twice as high in protected areas as in reserved forests and eight times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The densities of <b>rufous-necked</b> <b>hornbill</b> were higher inside protected areas, whereas the densities of great hornbill Buceros bicornis and wreathed hornbill were similar inside and outside protected areas. Key informant surveys revealed possible extirpation of some hornbill species at sites in two protected areas and three unclassed forests. These results highlight a paradoxical situation where individual populations of hornbills are being lost even in some legally protected habitat, whereas they continue to persist {{over most of the}} landscape. Better protection within protected areas and creative community-based conservation efforts elsewhere are necessary to maintain hornbill populations in this biodiversity-rich region...|$|E
