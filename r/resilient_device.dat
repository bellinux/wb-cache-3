A TCAD-based Preliminary Design Kit(PDK) development strategy is present here for a 10 nm SOI FinFET technology, with reliable device statistical variability coming from the comprehensive 3 D statistical device simulation and accurate statistical compact modelling.

A measurement method to characterise the frequency dependency of the transfer stiffness and the input stiffness of the <b>resilient</b> <b>device</b> is presented. The mechanical characteristics of the measurement method are investigated. In addition, some resilient devices used in buildings are analysed with respect to acoustic properties.

40|$|Point&Connect (P&C) {{offers an}} {{intuitive}} and <b>resilient</b> <b>device</b> pairing solution on standard mobile phones. Its operation follows the simple sequence of point-and-connect: when a user plans to pair her mobile phone with another device nearby, {{she makes a}} simple hand gesture that points her phone towards the intended target. The system will capture the user’s gesture, understand the target selection intention, and complete the device pairing. P&C is intentionbased, intuitive, and reduces user efforts in device pairing. The main technical challenge is {{to come up with}} a simple system technique to effectively capture and understand the intention of the user, and pick the right device among many others nearby. It should further work on any mobile phones or small devices without relying on infrastructure or special hardware. P&C meets this challenge with a novel collaborative scheme to measure maximum distance change based on acoustic signals. Using only a speaker and a microphone, P&C can be implemented solely in user-level software and work on COTS phones. P&C adds additional mechanisms to improve resiliency against imperfect user actions, acoustic disturbance, and even certain malicious attacks. We have implemented P&C in Windows Mobile phones and conducted extensive experimental evaluation, and showed that it is a cool and effective way to perform device pairing...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} {{our knowledge of the}} sound transmission and radiation processes of lightweight wall and floor structures, theoretical models are needed. Detailed models may form a valuable tool. In lightweight floor structures, impact sound insulation is perhaps the most important property to consider. This thesis presents an overview of various solution strategies that may be useful in finding a theoretical model for impact sound insulation. Expressions for the point mobility of infinite plates driven by a rigid indenter are derived. These expressions are needed when determining the deformation close to the excitation area, which is important when studying impact noise to properly describe the interaction between the source and the floor. A detailed three-dimensional thick-plate analysis is used. The excitating pressure is found by means of a variational formulation. The point mobility is calculated by means of numerical integration. The excitation force provided by the ISO tapping machine is examined, partly in relation to the three-dimensional deformation analysis. Results found in the literature are reviewed and reconsidered. Low-frequency asymptotes are derived. A more general impact force description is derived, suited for arbitrary frequency-dependent mobilities of the floor structure. The frequency-dependency of the mobility can be due to local effects, investigated by means of thick-plate theory, and/or global effects, investigated by means of a spatial Fourier transform method. A theoretical model for a point-excited simple lightweight floor is presented. The model is used for the prediction of impact noise level. A comparison between numerical computations and measurements found in the literature is performed. A relatively good correspondence between measurements and calculations can be achieved. Lightweight walls (and floors) are often designed as a framework of studs with plates on each side. The studs can be seen as walls in the cavity, thus introducing finiteness. A prediction model for airborne sound insulation including these effects is presented. Due to variabilities, no structure can be perfectly periodic. The effects of near-periodicity are studied by means of transform technique and the expectation operator. The near-periodicity leads to an increase of the damping (if material damping is present). <b>Resilient</b> <b>devices</b> are commonly used in lightweight structures to decrease the sound transmission in a broad frequency band. Applications of such devices may be found, for example, in resiliently mounted ceilings in aeroplanes, ships and buildings.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{a method for}} activity recognition partially <b>resilient</b> on mobile <b>device</b> orientation, by using data from a mobile phone embedded accelerometer. This method is partially <b>resilient</b> on mobile <b>device</b> orientation, {{in such a way}} that a mobile device can be rotated around only one axis for an arbitrary angle. The classifier for activity recognition is built using data from one default orientation. This method introduces a calibration phase in which the phone’s orientation is determined. After that, accelerometer data is transformed into the default coordinate system and further processed. The solution is compared with the method that built a classifier using data from multiple orientations. Three classifiers were tested and a high accuracy of around 90 % was achieved for all of them. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Deploying mobile {{devices to}} {{frontline}} troops presents many potential benefits, e. g. situational awareness, enhanced communication capabilities, etc. However, security remains {{an impediment to}} realizing such capability. In this research, we develop and evaluate an approach to securing the non-volatile storage {{of a collection of}} mobile devices. Our technique relies on well-established cryptographic primitives, combining them in a unique way to meet military mission specific security and resiliency requirements. Specifically, we create MDFS, a distributed mobile file system using erasure coding, Shamir’s threshold secret sharing, and the symmetric AES block cipher. The resulting system provides two important properties: (1) data at rest is protected even after total compromise of up to k devices, and (2) data is replicated within an infrastuctureless ad hoc network and, as such, <b>resilient</b> to <b>device</b> outages. We implement MDFS on Android mobile devices and achieve ≃ 10 Mbps throughput in real-world performance experiments, suggesting that MDFS is suitable for a variety of practical workloads. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper makes simple {{observation}} {{on security}} of the net-worked cryptographic <b>device</b> <b>resilient</b> to capture that was developed to protect user’s private keys by software-only techniques. That scheme provided valuable features for secure generation of digital signatures or decryption of messages in a way of retaining a password-protected pri-vate key in a user-controlled device. The key idea was to exploit network connectivity rather than tamper-resistance of the device for securing the private key in software. However, we have found a few weak points that are not negligible in some sense. It was difficult to protect the private key in software even with provable security. So, we will describe such dif-ficulties and provide possible solutions in this paper. Also the networked cryptographic devices will be augmented in that fashion. ...|$|R
40|$|Orientation {{estimation}} is a {{very well}} known topic in many fields such as in aerospace or robotics. However, the sensors used are usually very ex- pensive, heavy and big, which make them not suitable for IoT (Internet of Things) based applications. This thesis presents a study of how different sensor fusion algorithms perform in low cost hardware and in high acceler- ation scenarios. For this purpose, an Arduino MKR 1000 is used together with an accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. The objective of the thesis is to choose the most suitable algorithm for the purposed practical application, which consists on attaching the device to a moving object, such as a skate board or a bike. Once the orientation is estimated, a movement recognition algorithm that was developed is able to match what trick or movement was performed. The algorithm chosen was the Madgwick one with some minor adjustments, which uses quaternions for the estimation and is very <b>resilient</b> when the <b>device</b> is under strong external accelerations...|$|R
