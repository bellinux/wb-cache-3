40|$|One {{of the key}} {{decisions}} in crop production is the choice of row distance and plant density. The choice of these planting pattern parameters is especially challenging in heterogeneous systems, such as systems containing alternating strips. Here we use functional-structural plant modelling {{to address the problem}} of identifying optimal row distances and plant density in a heterogeneous crop system. We compare radiation capture in sole cotton and <b>relay</b> <b>strip</b> cotton, remaining after harvest of wheat from a wheat-cotton <b>relay</b> <b>strip</b> intercrop. We compare light interception in the two systems under different scenarios of row distance and plant density. Light interception calculations with the functional-structural plant model were evaluated using field observations. Light interception by cotton was mainly determined by row distances and to a lesser extent by plant density. Light interception was reduced by the gaps between the strips in strip cotton. Plant density (per unit area of the whole system) providing maximum light interception was lower in <b>relay</b> <b>strip</b> cotton than in normal cotton. Plastic responses of cotton to canopy heterogeneity, accounted for in the model, did not result in full radiation capture in strip cotton. The gaps between the rows in strip cotton allowed light penetration to deeper canopy layers relevant for the reduction of fruit abortion rate. We conclude that <b>relay</b> <b>strip</b> cotton cannot attain the same light interception as sole cotton, due to the gaps between the strips. Increasing plant density was insufficient to bridge the gap. Thus, the maximum light interception in strip cotton is lower than in sole cotton, and is achieved at a lower overall plant density. FSP modelling provided a suitable tool to identify row distance and plant densities providing high light interception in a heterogeneous canopy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Production {{practice}} shows shaded soybean in wheat-maize-soybean; <b>relay</b> <b>strip</b> intercropping {{system has}} better {{tolerance to drought}} as compared with sole cropping soybean. Our researches are to understand the reasons through non-hydraulic root signals (nHRS), yield and the relationships among them. Pot experiments were conducted with two soybean cultivars, under shade of maize (LI) and normal irradiance (HI). nHRS were traced during manipulative progressive soil drying period at branching stage under good soil conditions (HW), water stress treatment (LW), in 2010. Well-watered (WW), light drought (LD), moderate drought (MD) and severe drought (SD) were applied in 2009. In response to soil drying, nHRS appeared earlier in Gongxuan No. 1 (GX) than Gongqiudou 05 - 8 (GQ) under two irradiance treatments, but it disappeared earlier for GX than GQ under normal irradiance. GX exhibited a wider average soil water content threshold range (TR) of nHRS under low irradiance. Drought stress significantly decreased the shoot dry mass, root mass and grain yield (P< 0. 05), excluding LD and nHRS treatments. Water use efficiency was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in GX than GQ under drought conditions in both irradiances. In a conclusion, soybean cultivar GX has wider TR in low irradiance condition, light drought had no significant effect on yield, nHRS maybe beneficial to maintain soybean yield under drought condition...|$|E
40|$|Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) /maize (Zea mays L.) /soybean (Glycine max L.) <b>relay</b> <b>strip</b> {{intercropping}} (W/M/S) {{system is}} commonly used by the smallholders in the Southwest of China. However, little known is how to manage phosphorus (P) to enhance P use efficiency of the W/M/S system and to mitigate P leaching that is {{a major source of}} pollution. Field experiments were carried out in 2011, 2012, and 2013 to test the impact of five P application rates on yield and P use efficiency of the W/M/S system. The study measured grain yield, shoot P uptake, apparent P recovery efficiency (PRE) and soil P content. A linear-plateau model was used to determine the critical P rate that maximizes gains in the indexes of system productivity. The results show that increase in P application rates aggrandized shoot P uptake and crops yields at threshold rates of 70 and 71. 5 kg P ha- 1 respectively. With P application rates increasing, the W/M/S system decreased the PRE from 35. 9 % to 12. 3 % averaged over the three years. A rational P application rate, 72 kg P ha- 1, or an appropriate soil Olsen-P level, 19. 1 mg kg- 1, drives the W/M/S system to maximize total grain yield while minimizing P surplus, {{as a result of the}} PRE up to 28. 0 %. We conclude that rational P application is an important approach for relay intercropping to produce high yield while mitigating P pollution and the rational P application-based integrated P fertilizer management is vital for sustainable intensification of agriculture in the Southwest of China...|$|E

40|$|Optimum {{planting}} geometries {{have been}} shown to increase crop yields in maize-soybean intercrop systems. However, little is known about whether changes in planting geometry improve the seasonal water use of maize and soybean intercrops. We conducted two different field experiments in 2013 and 2014 to investigate the effects of changes in planting geometry on water use efficiency (WUE) and evapotranspiration (ETc) of maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] <b>relay</b> <b>strip</b> intercrop systems. Our results showed that the leaf area index of maize for both years where intercropping occurred was notably greater compared to sole maize, thus the soil water content (SWC), soil evaporation (E), and throughfall followed a decreasing trend in the following order: central row of maize strip (CRM) < adjacent row between maize and soybean strip (AR) < central row of soybean strip (CRS). When intercropped, the highest grain yield for maize and total yields were recorded for the 40 : 120 cm and 40 : 160 cm planting geometries using 160 cm and 200 cm bandwidth, respectively. By contrast, the highest grain yield of intercropped soybean was appeared for the 20 : 140 cm and 20 : 180 cm planting geometries. The largest land equivalent ratios were 1. 62 for the 40 : 120 cm planting geometry and 1. 79 for the 40 : 160 cm planting geometry, indicating that both intercropping strategies were advantageous. Changes in planting geometries did not show any significant effect on the ETc of the maize and soybean intercrops. WUEs in the different planting geometries of intercrop systems were lower compared to sole cropping. However, the highest group WUEs of 23. 06 and 26. 21 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 for the 40 : 120 cm and 40 : 160 cm planting geometries, respectively, were 39 % and 23 % higher than those for sole cropping. Moreover, the highest water equivalent ratio values of 1. 66 and 1. 76 also appeared for the 40 : 120 cm and 40 : 160 cm planting geometries. We therefore suggest that an optimum planting geometry of 40 : 160 cm and bandwidth of 200 cm could be a viable planting pattern management method for attaining high group WUE in maize-soybean intercrop systems...|$|E
50|$|In May 2016, it was {{reported}} that Alekseyev was one of 14 Russian athletes, and nine medalists, implicated in doping following the retesting of urine from the 2008 Olympic Games. Alekseyev was named by Russian press agency TASS as having failed the retest, which was undertaken following the Russian doping scandal of 2015 and 2016. If confirmed, under IOC and IAAF rules, he stands to lose all results, medals and records from the date of the original test to May 2016. As this would be a second doping offence, he also faces a lifetime ban from sport. By 13 September 2016 his doping case and subsequent disqualification from the 2008 Summer Olympics was confirmed, and he and the Russian 4x400m <b>relay</b> team were <b>stripped</b> of their bronze medals.|$|R
5|$|Two days later, Bolt ran as {{the third}} leg in the Jamaican 4x100 metres relay team, {{increasing}} his gold medal total to three. Along with teammates Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, and Asafa Powell, Bolt broke another world and Olympic record, their 37.10 s finish breaking the previous record by three-tenths of a second. Powell, who anchored the team to the finishing line, lamented {{the loss of his}} 100 m record to Bolt but showed no animosity towards his Jamaican rival, stating that he was delighted to help him set his third world record. In January 2017 the Jamaican <b>relay</b> team were <b>stripped</b> of their gold medals after a blood sample taken from Nesta Carter - one of Bolt's teammates in the relay - after the race, was tested again nine years later and tested positive for a banned substance. Following his victories, Bolt donated US$50,000 to the children of Sichuan province in China to help those harmed by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.|$|R
