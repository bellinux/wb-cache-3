40|$|BACKGROUND: The repair and/or {{replacement}} of lock culvert valves {{is an issue}} that many US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) offices are facing, partly because many of the navigation locks have reached or exceeded their design life. <b>Reverse</b> tainter <b>valves</b> are the most common valve type found on navigation locks constructed by the USACE (Pickett and Neilson 1988; Headquarters, USACE 1975). Many existing <b>reverse</b> tainter <b>valves</b> are of double-skin-plate construction, but several projects {{are in the process of}} replacing these valves with new valves of a vertically framed, single-skin design because they are easier to inspect and repair. The geometric and hydraulic parameters describing a <b>reverse</b> tainter <b>valve</b> are shown in Figure 1. Lock culvert flow is controlled by rotating the valve about the trunnion axis. The valve position is listed as the valve opening ratio b/B, where b is the distance from the valve lip to the culvert floor, and B is the culvert height at the <b>valve.</b> Figure 1. <b>Reverse</b> tainter <b>valve</b> parameters...|$|R

50|$|A scheme {{patented}} in 2004 {{is intended}} for conversion of existing AC transmission lines to HVDC. Two of the three circuit conductors are operated as a bipole. The third conductor {{is used as a}} parallel monopole, equipped with <b>reversing</b> <b>valves</b> (or parallel <b>valves</b> connected in <b>reverse</b> polarity). The parallel monopole periodically relieves current from one pole or the other, switching polarity over a span of several minutes. The bipole conductors would be loaded to either 1.37 or 0.37 of their thermal limit, with the parallel monopole always carrying ±1 times its thermal limit current. The combined RMS heating effect is as if each of the conductors is always carrying 1.0 of its rated current. This allows heavier currents to be carried by the bipole conductors, and full use of the installed third conductor for energy transmission. High currents can be circulated through the line conductors even when load demand is low, for removal of ice.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} functional and hemodynamic factors that determine the mitral-tricuspid and aortic-pulmonary valve closure sequence in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Background. The physiologic factors determining closure sequence of cardiac valves in various forms of heart disease have been found to be complex. Few data exist for dilated cardiomyopathy, particularly for differentiating the effects of a conduction delay versus changes in ventricular performance. Methods. A group of 64 patients were compared with 36 control subjects. Timing of valve closure and electromechanical intervals were determined by combined M-mode echocardiography, phonocardiography and apexcardiography. Hemodynamic data from right heart catheterization were available in 46 patients. Results. In all control subjects, the aortic valve closed before the pulmonary valve and the mitral valve closed before the tricuspid valve. In the study group, 30 patients (49 %) had <b>reversed</b> aortic-pulmonary <b>valve</b> closure and 27 (90 %) of these had a left-sided conduction delay. There were 38 patients (60 %) who had <b>reversed</b> mitral-tricuspid <b>valve</b> closure, but this was unrelated to the presence of a left-sided conduction delay. The presence of high ventricular filling pressures and poor systolic function was associated with delayed closure of both the mitral and the tricuspid valve. This caused the closure sequence to be related to the size of the difference between mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure and mean central venous pressure and also the magnitude of right ventricular dysfunction. Patients with a low wedge pressure (16 mm Hg) but a low central venous pressure had a high prevalence (86 %) of reversal of mitral-tricuspid valve closure. Patients with high wedge and central venous pressures had a moderate prevalence (47 %) of mitral-tricuspid valve closure reversal. Similar findings were observed for right ventricular dysfunction. If the right ventricle was normal or severely dysfunctional, a reversed closure sequence was less common (52 % and 41 %, respectively) than if moderate dysfunction was present (78 %). Conclusions. Aortic-pulmonary valve closure sequence is strongly related to the presence of a left-sided conduction delay. The mitraltricuspid valve closure sequence is unrelated to a conduction delay but can be reversed by relative differences in the severity of systolic dysfunction and filling pressures between the two ventricles...|$|R

5000|$|As {{the output}} of an impact wrench, when hammering, is a very short impact force, the actual {{effective}} torque is difficult to measure, with several different ratings in use. As the tool delivers a fixed amount of energy with each blow, rather than a fixed torque, the actual output torque changes with {{the duration of the}} output pulse. If the output is springy or capable of absorbing energy, the impulse will simply be absorbed, and virtually no torque will ever be applied, and somewhat counter-intuitively, if the object is very springy, the wrench may actually turn backwards as the energy is delivered back to the anvil, while it is not connected to the hammer and able to spin freely. [...] A wrench that is capable of freeing a rusted nut on a very large bolt may be incapable of turning a small screw mounted on a spring. [...] "Maximum torque" [...] is the number most often given by manufacturers, which is the instantaneous peak torque delivered if the anvil is locked into a perfectly solid object. [...] "Working torque" [...] is a more realistic number for continually driving a very stiff fastener. [...] "Nut-busting torque" [...] is often quoted, with the usual definition being that the wrench can loosen a nut tightened with the specified amount of torque in some specified time period. Accurately controlling the output torque of an impact wrench is very difficult, and even an experienced operator will have a hard time making sure a fastener is not undertightened or overtightened using an impact wrench. Special socket extensions are available, which take advantage of the inability of an impact wrench to work against a spring, to precisely limit the output torque. Designed with spring steel, they act as large torsion springs, flexing at their torque rating, and preventing any further torque from being applied to the fastener. Some impact wrenches designed for product assembly have a built-in torque control system, such as a built-in torsion spring and a mechanism that shuts the tool down when the given torque is exceeded. When very precise torque is required, an impact wrench is only used to snug down the fastener, with a torque wrench used for the final tightening. Due to the lack of standards when measuring the maximum torque, some manufacturers are believed to inflate their ratings, or to use measurements with little bearing on how the tool will perform in actual use. Many air impact wrenches incorporate a flow regulator into their design, either as a separate control or part of the <b>reversing</b> <b>valve,</b> allowing torque to be roughly limited in one or both directions, while electric tools may use a variable speed trigger for the same effect.|$|E

Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw <b>reverser</b> to control <b>valve</b> events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs.

40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, a {{passenger}} car suspension must has high performance criteria with light weight, low cost, and low energy consumption. Pilot controlled proportional valve is designed and analyzed to get small pressure change rate after blow-off, {{and to get}} a fast response of the damper, a reverse damping mechanism is adapted. The reverse continuous variable damper is designed as a HS-SH damper which offers good body control with reduced transferred input force from the tire, compared with any other type of suspension system. The damper structure is designed, so that rebound and compression damping forces can be tuned independently, of which the variable valve is placed externally. The rate of pressure change with respect to the flow rate after blow-off becomes smooth when the fixed orifice size increases, which means that the blow-off slope is controllable using the fixed orifice size. Damping forces are measured with the change of the solenoid current at the different piston velocities to confirm the maximum hysteresis of 20 N, linearity, and variance of damping force. The damping force variance is wide and continuous, and is controlled by the spool opening, of which scheme is usually adapted in proportional <b>valves.</b> The <b>reverse</b> continuous variable damper developed in this study is expected to be utilized in the semi-active suspension systems in passenger cars after its performance and simplicity of the design is confirmed through a real car test.
