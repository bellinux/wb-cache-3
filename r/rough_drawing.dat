He was the first English artist to make illustrations of dragonflies accurate enough to be identified to species (Aeshna grandis at top left of plate illustrated), though his <b>rough</b> <b>drawing</b> of a larva (at lower left) with the mask extended appears to be plagiarised.|$|E
25|$|The Kushans {{sponsored}} Buddhism {{together with}} other Iranian and Hindu faiths, and probably contributed to the flourishing of Greco-Buddhist art. Their coins, however, suggest a lack of artistic sophistication: the representations of their kings, such as Kanishka, tend to be crude (lack of proportion, <b>rough</b> <b>drawing),</b> {{and the image of}} the Buddha is an assemblage of a Hellenistic Buddha statue with feet grossly represented and spread apart in the same fashion as the Kushan king. This tends to indicate the anteriority of the Hellenistic Greco-Buddhist statues, used as models, and a subsequent corruption by Kushan artists.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{has been}} {{creating}} complicated abstract paintings and litographs since the 1970s. She employs {{a wide variety}} of media, working in painting, printmaking and richly textured mixed media pieces. Such images and collage elements as commercial slogans, sign-like petroglyphs, <b>rough</b> <b>drawing,</b> and the inclusion and layering of text are unusually intersected into a complex vision created out of the artist’s personal experience. Her works contain strong, insistent socio-political commentary that speaks to past and present cultural appropriation and abuse, while identifying the continued significance of the Native American peoples. She addresses today’s tribal politics, human rights and environmental issues with humor. Smith is known internationally for her philosophically centered work regarding her strong traditional beliefs and political activism.|$|E

There!” (another plunge)—“put thy beard out of the other opening, and Allah will {{make it easy to}} us.” In the ecstasy of fear my tormentor turned his face, as he was bidden, towards the camel’s head.

6000|$|All day {{the wind}} had been rising, so that the larks on the moor chirruped fitfully near the ground, or rose only to be driven like leaves before the wind. The sun set in a bloody welter of clouds, and the moon was hidden. The glare, they say, was golden like a beam shining out of the sky, not a uniform blaze, but broken all over by curving flashes like the waving of swords. It lasted but a moment and left the night dark and obscure. There were letters about it in Nature, and a <b>rough</b> <b>drawing</b> that no one thought very like. (You may see it for yourself--the drawing that was unlike the glare--on page 42 of Vol. cclx. of that publication.) ...|$|E

"Never mind," [...] said he at length, [...] "this will answer;" [...] and he {{drew from}} his {{waistcoat}} pocket {{a scrap of}} what I took to be very dirty foolscap, and made upon it a <b>rough</b> <b>drawing</b> with the pen. While he did this, I retained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly. When the design was complete, {{he handed it to}} me without rising. As I received it, a loud growl was heard, succeeded by a scratching at the door. Jupiter opened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand, rushed in, leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown him much attention during previous visits. When his gambols were over, I looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth, found myself not a little puzzled at what my friend had depicted.|$|E
60|$|The {{problem that}} was forcing itself upon my mind was: did Robina {{know how to}} milk a cow? Robina, I argued, the idea once in her mind, would {{immediately}} have ordered a cow, clamouring for it--as Hopkins had picturesquely expressed it--as though she had not strength to live another day without a cow. Her next proceeding {{would have been to}} buy a milking-stool. It was a tasteful milking-stool, this one she had selected, ornamented with the <b>rough</b> <b>drawing</b> of a cow in poker work: a little too solid for my taste, but one that I should say would wear well. The pail she had not as yet had time to see about. This galvanised bucket we were using was, I took it, a temporary makeshift. When Robina had leisure she would go into the town and purchase something at an art stores. That, to complete the scheme, she would have done well to have taken a few practical lessons in milking would come to her, as an inspiration, {{with the arrival of the}} cow. I noticed that Robina's steps as we approached the cow were less elastic. Just outside the cow Robina halted.|$|E

50|$|The prestezza method {{consists}} of three steps: At first the artist applied a brown undercoat, using a color that was used for etching technology, on the canvas. Thereafter he made a <b>rough</b> <b>drawing</b> using white colour, very often like a sketch. Then the actual painting process started.|$|E
50|$|The {{impetus for}} this episode was {{the writers and}} {{producers}} not wanting to keep writing episodes in which Finn is continuously rejected by Princess Bubblegum. The character of Flame Princess was largely designed by Sugar, based on a <b>rough</b> <b>drawing</b> by storyboard revisionist and character designer Natasha Allegri. The episode received largely positive reviews from critics, with both David's and DiCicco's voice work earning praise.|$|E

A local legend has the two famous outlaws meeting for dinner in the Old Adobe Hotel in nearby Hot Springs, New Mexico. Supposedly Jesse invited Billy to come to Missouri and join his gang but the Kid declined. However, that is generally viewed as legend, and it is not confirmed that the two ever even met.|$|R

50|$|According to the {{reconstruction}} Masaccio started by producing a <b>rough</b> <b>drawing</b> {{of the composition}} and perspective lines on the wall. The drawing was covered with fresh plaster for making the fresco. To ensure the precise transfer of the perspective lines from the sketch to the plaster, Masaccio inserted a nail in at the vanishing point under {{the base of the}} cross and attached strings to it, which he pressed in (or carved into) the plaster. The marks of the preparatory works are still visible.|$|E

50|$|The oldest {{depiction}} of Schloss Lauterbach is in a map by Philipp Apian from 1568. It is a <b>rough</b> <b>drawing,</b> but shows {{the remains of}} a fort with four corner towers.An engraving by Michael Wening from around 1700 shows the castle complex with a French parterre to the east of the castle.The earlier main structure is shown, {{with the addition of a}} chapel and a wing joining it to a three-story building that no longer exists.Another engraving by Wening, also published in the 1700 Historico Topographica Descriptio, shows the schloss from the northwest. The main building appears as two separate structures, and the chapel has a rounded apse. The two engravings may represent the building at a different stage of construction.|$|E
50|$|Shelton has {{frequently}} employed techniques of doubling, reversing and inverting photographs. She {{refers to this}} approach as 'visual stammering', and uses it {{to draw attention to}} the subjectivity of photography. Doublet (after Heavenly Creatures), Parker/Hulme crime scene, Port Hills, Christchurch, New Zealand (from 2001) from her Public Spaces series (2001-2003) for example is a dipytch made up of a single image of a curve of a forest path, one moving to the left and one to the right. The seemingly banal image draws its power from the site it documents, the location of the murder of Honorah Parker, later dramatised in Peter Jackson's film Heavenly Creatures. In another work, Wintering, after a Van der Velden study, Otira Gorge from 2008, Shelton works from a preparatory sketch by Dutch-born artist Petrus van der Velden held in the collection of the Hocken Library at the University of Otago, choosing the <b>rough</b> <b>drawing</b> over the artist's dramatic oil paintings of the same topic.|$|E
