40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The root pathogen, Phytophthora lateralis Tucker and Milbrath, {{continues}} its destructive spread among Port-Orford Cedars (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (Murr.) Parl.) of southwestern Oregon. This thesis concerns {{spread of the}} fungus between root systems of individual trees in a 49 -year-old stand predominantly of Port-Orford- Cedar. The contribution of <b>root</b> <b>grafts</b> to spread is given special attention. Root systems of five groups of trees, 36 in all, were hydraulically excavated and examined for the frequency and character of <b>root</b> <b>grafting</b> and for the part played by the grafts in disease spread. Eighty three percent of the trees studied {{had at least one}} <b>root</b> <b>graft</b> and frequently trees were grafted into complexes of as many as nine trees, functionally uniting widely spaced (39 feet) individuals. The frequency of <b>root</b> <b>grafting</b> was found to be a linear function of both horizontal and vertical distances between trees of a pair. If either distance is increased the frequency of <b>root</b> <b>grafting</b> decreases. <b>Root</b> <b>grafting</b> is therefore most prevalent in dense stands on level ground and least prevalent in sparse stands on slopes. Disease may spread between trees by fungus sporulation on infected roots followed by reinfection (discontinuous spread) and/or by vegetative spread between <b>root</b> <b>grafted</b> trees (continuous spread). The two forms were compared with respect to rate of spread. Approximately 91 percent of the disease spread in the study trees resulted from discontinuous spread, while only 9 percent resulted from continuous spread through <b>root</b> <b>grafts.</b> An elementary simulation model was formulated to determine the degree of association of roots of trees separated by given distances. The model is used to explain disease spread between trees in the absence of <b>root</b> <b>grafts.</b> Here, an hypothesis, "wash back," is introduced to explain disease spread upslope by the overlap of infected and healthy roots. The following conclusions concerning disease spread emerge from examination of root systems: (1) disease spread through <b>root</b> <b>grafts</b> is of minor importance over time as compared with spread by sporulation and reinfection; (2) <b>root</b> <b>grafts</b> are important in disease spread in the absence of sporulation and reinfection (vegetative fungus spread through grafted complexes will result in continued tree mortality), and (3) disease spread upslope through <b>root</b> <b>grafted</b> trees becomes less likely as slope steepens. Disease spread between overlapping root systems of healthy and infected trees can account for disease spread upslope in the absence of <b>root</b> <b>grafts...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Root</b> <b>grafting</b> {{has long}} been {{observed}} in forest trees but the adaptive significance of this trait has not been fully explained. Various authors have proposed that <b>root</b> <b>grafting</b> between trees contributes to mechanical support by linking adjacent root systems. Keeley proposes that this trait would be of greatest advantage in swamps where soils provide poor mechanical support. He provides as evidence a greenhouse study of Nyssa sylvatica Marsh in which seedlings of swamp provenance formed between-individual <b>root</b> <b>grafts</b> more frequently than upland provenance seedlings. In agreement with this within-species study, Keeley observed that arid zone species rarely exhibit grafts. Keeley also demonstrated that vines graft less commonly than trees, and herbs never do. Since the need for mechanical support coincides with this trend, these data seem to support his model. In this paper, the authors explore the mechanisms and ecological significance of <b>root</b> <b>grafting,</b> leading to predictions of <b>root</b> <b>grafting</b> incidence.

The presence of X. fastidiosa {{was confirmed by}} light microscopy, double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and polymerase chain reaction in rootlets and main roots of CVC-symptomatic Pera sweet orange in 11 of the 15 rootstocks tested. These results suggest that bacterial translocation from the aerial plant parts to the root system occurs but is not essential for X. fastidiosa to induce symptoms in the aerial parts. Bacterial translocation to the roots was not correlated with CVC leaf-symptom severity in the Pera scion. To determine if CVC disease could be transmitted by natural <b>root</b> <b>grafts,</b> two matched seedlings of each of four sweet orange cultivars (Pera, Natal, Valencia, and Caipira) were transplanted into single pots.

50|$|In the Lake States, if {{infection}} is {{discovered in a}} tree, a vibratory plow line, commonly called a trench (or better yet, two generally parallel trenches at different distances from the area of risk) may be plowed to a minimum depth of {{four and a half}} feet (54 inches) between it and other potentially susceptible species to prevent <b>root</b> <b>graft</b> disease transmission. Such plowing will sever <b>root</b> <b>grafts</b> that may transmit the disease to neighboring trees. In southern states like Texas, where heavy clay soils are prevalent, rocksaws are commonly used in lieu of vibratory plows. An infected tree should not be cut down before vibratory plowing, because that increases the risk of oak wilt migrating quickly via roots to nearby trees. Injections of propiconazole, a fungicide, can help prevent transmission as well; as many as a half dozen injections every six months may be required to protect a large red oak near infected trees. Injections every other year may also be used to treat a white oak, if it is not yet greatly affected.|$|R
50|$|The {{oak wilt}} fungus spreads in two basic ways: {{transfer}} of spores from diseased to healthy trees by insect vectors and {{movement of the}} fungus from a diseased tree to a healthy tree through <b>root</b> <b>grafts.</b> If conditions are right after the oak has wilted and died, spores are produced on fungal mats that form under the bark of the tree. These mats produce asexual spores called endoconidia, which are barrel shaped spores produced in chains. If compatible mating types are present, these mats will also produce sexual spores called ascospores in fruiting structures called perithecia. Certain species of sap beetles are attracted to the fruity smell of these mats. They will visit the mats to feed and breed, thereby picking up the fungal spores. These same beetles are also attracted to the bleeding sap of wounded oak trees and can then deposit the spores picked up from the fungal mats. This method of transmission is important for introducing the fungus into a new area {{it could not have}} reached by transmission via <b>root</b> <b>grafts.</b>|$|R

40|$|Grafting, an old plant {{propagation}} practice, is still widely used with fruit trees {{and in recent}} decades also with vegetables. Taxonomic proximity is a general prerequisite for successful graft-take and long-term survival of the grafted, composite plant. However, the mechanisms underlying interspecific graft incompatibility are as yet insufficiently understood. Hormonal signals, auxin in particular, are believed {{to play an important}} role in the wound healing and vascular regeneration within the graft union zone. Long-distance protein, mRNA and small RNA graft-transmissible signals currently emerge as novel mechanisms which regulate nutritional and developmental root/top relations and may play a pivotal role in grafting physiology. Grafting also has significant pathogenic projections. On one hand, stock to scion mechanical contact enables the spread of diseases, even without a complete graft union. But, on the other hand, grafting onto resistant rootstocks serves as a principal tool in the management of fruit tree plagues and vegetable soil-borne diseases. The ‘graft hybrid’ historic controversy has not yet been resolved. Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic modification of DNA-methylation patterns may account for certain graft-transformation phenomena. <b>Root</b> <b>grafting</b> is a wide spread natural phenomenon; both intraspecific and interspecific <b>root</b> <b>grafts</b> have been recorded. <b>Root</b> <b>grafts</b> have an evolutionary role in the survival of storm-hit forest stands as well as in the spread of devastating diseases.

Propiconazole is a systemic fungicide widely {{used for the}} control of oak wilt, however, the long-term efficacy of this fungicide has not been well established and treatment effectiveness may be below levels that justify its use in many situations. To date, {{it is not known}} if propiconazole applications prevent <b>root</b> <b>graft</b> transmission of Ceratocystis fagacearum nor if they can completely eradicate this pathogen from the root system of an infected tree. Significant translocation of propiconazole into the roots from the point of injection has not been demonstrated and fungitoxic concentrations of the fungicide have not been determined in vivo. Furthermore, symptom development is not induced by pathogen colonization of the root system; oaks respond to infection only when C. fagacearum spreads above ground in the vascular system. Therefore, it is impossible {{to determine the extent of}} pathogen distribution in the root systems of trees near disease centers. Treatment failure may result from poorly informed management decisions that do not take into account pathogen distribution or the capabilities of the systemic fungicide being utilized. This dissertation presents the results of three investigations conducted to examine use of propiconazole to control <b>root</b> <b>graft</b> transmission of C. fagacearum in red oaks (Section Lobatae). The distribution of propiconazole in the root system of treated trees was examined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. While substantial movement of the fungicide into the root system did occur following injection, the inability of propiconazole to prevent infection or eradicate the pathogen from root-inoculated oaks was demonstrated. The spatial and temporal spread of C. fagacearum in the root system of oaks in or near disease centers, and the role of self- and inter-tree <b>root</b> <b>grafts</b> in pathogen spread was examined. Distribution of C. fagacearum in the root systems of wilted and wilting trees was sporadic, and the prevalence and importance of self-grafts was noted. Finally, the effects of propiconazole on the growth and anatomy of treated oaks was investigated. Plant growth regulating properties of the fungicide suggest that fungitoxicity alone may not be responsible for propiconazoleinduced disease protection. The implications of these previously unknown aspects of the host-pathogen-fungicide interactions in propiconazole treated trees, and suggestions for improved treatment efficacy and oak wilt management are discussed...|$|R
