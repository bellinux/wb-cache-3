The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA, part of the Department of Transportation) has been the main federal government agency active {{in the debate over}} motorcycle rights for such things as off-road <b>riding,</b> <b>vehicle</b> requirements and helmets in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Valid {{examples}} of what constitutes as suspicion of carrying illegal aliens include driving a station wagon with fold down seats or spare tires removed to conceal aliens, having a low <b>riding</b> <b>vehicle,</b> having an overly packed vehicle, or driving erratically. Also, the officer's knowledge of the area, experience, and training in dealing with illegal aliens dictates the decision to pursue a search. Thus, an officer must {{have one of these}} articulable facts in order stop someone and question their citizenship.|$|E
40|$|The wheels as {{vibration}} transformation {{elements and}} noise emitters substantially {{contribute to the}} tottal noise level of <b>riding</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Therefore rubber like material is also utilized for construction of the silent wheel. We aimed at investigation of dynamic behavior of raiway tram wheel with a special construction. The dynamic parameters of the wheel are studied. The numerical modelling, computation and analysis were performed in ANSYS Release 6 environment...|$|E
5000|$|As guests {{reached the}} end of the queue, they entered a 1930s-era Hollywood sound stage where they were loaded by cast members into one of two pairs of open, theatre-style seating <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{utilized}} a [...] "traveling theatre"-style automated guided <b>vehicle</b> <b>ride</b> system similar to the former Universe of Energy attraction at Epcot. However, here the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> were much smaller in size, were grouped together in pairs of two, and featured an open cab in the first row of the front vehicle for a live tour guide to stand, provide narration, and operate the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Earlier and later in the day, only the second pair of <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> (#2B) were used as the first pair of <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> (#1A) were only used during the busier times of day.|$|R
50|$|The next {{scene was}} {{a tribute to}} gangster films. The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> passed through the dark and seedy backstreets of a 1930s Chicago and past an audio-animatronic Tom Powers (James Cagney) in a scene from The Public Enemy. When both pairs of <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> were in use, the #1A <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{continued}} {{on to the next}} show scene past a green traffic light above a tunnel entrance while the #2B <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> was stopped when the traffic light changed to red. While stopped, a live gangster named Mugsy (Boy) or Mugsi (Girl) and their audio-animatronic companions Squid and Beans showed up and got involved in a shoot-out with rival mobsters (Brains, Legs, and Weasel) in a car {{on the opposite side of}} the street where the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> was stopped. During the shootout, the live gangster then chased away the tour guide and hijacked the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|R
5|$|When Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin was {{announced}} in November 2011, Oceaneering had already developed a working prototype of the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The first concept art for the attraction was released in April 2012: a circular <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle,</b> seating eight riders in two rows of four. On May 11, 2012 Oceaneering filed a patent application for the ride's technology. At the November 2012 IAAPA Attractions Expo, SeaWorld Orlando and Oceaneering International revealed the trackless, motion simulator-based <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> to the public.|$|R
40|$|The wheels as {{vibration}} transformation {{elements and}} noise emitters substantially {{contribute to the}} total noise level of <b>riding</b> <b>vehicle.</b> We aimed at investigation of dynamic behavior of railway tram wheel with a special construction. This wheel has a rim separated from disk by rubber cushioning. The selected dynamic parameters of the wheel are modal, frequency and damping characteristics. Proportional damping was implemented into rubber layer of FE wheel model as the first approximation of dissipation behavior...|$|E
50|$|The {{next film}} genre {{introduced}} were horror films as the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> traveled through an ancient burial chamber full of mummies, {{some of which}} had come to life. The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> soon left the tomb and entered the jungle from Tarzan the Ape Man. Here, audio-animatronic figures of Tarzan (Johnny Weissmuller) swinging on a vine, Jane (Maureen OSullivan) sitting atop Timba the elephant, and Cheeta the chimpanzee could be seen. The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> then moved past the final scene from Casablanca, featuring audio-animatronics of Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) as they {{stood in front of}} a waiting airplane. Next, the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> passed a film projection of Mickey Mouse in his role as the Sorcerers Apprentice from Walt Disneys animated film, Fantasia.The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> then entered into the Munchkinland scene from The Wizard of Oz, where Dorothys house had landed on the Wicked Witch of the East. When both the #1A and #2B <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> were in use, they met up here and came to a stop {{in the middle of the}} scene. Audio-Animatronic Munchkins began to appear from various places and sang as they welcomed guests to their home. However, a plume of smoke suddenly rose from the ground as an audio-animatronic Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) appeared and asked who was responsible for killing the Wicked Witch of the East. The tour guide aboard the #1A <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> briefly interacted with her before she disappeared in another puff of smoke. The Munchkins reappeared from their hiding places and began to sing again as both <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> followed the Yellow Brick Road out of Munchkinland past audio-animatronic figures of Dorothy (Judy Garland), Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), Tin Man (Jack Haley), Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) and Toto standing in front of the Emerald City, and onto the rides grand finale.|$|R
50|$|Next, the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{entered into}} {{a tribute to the}} Western genre. Here, guests {{encountered}} audio-animatronics of the Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) standing outside of a saloon and Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) sitting atop his horse. The #2B <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> (which was already being driven by the gangster) continued past a shootout between the town sheriff and an audio-animatronic bank robber named Snake. The gangster ignored the shootout and continued on to the next scene. However, the #1A <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> (which was still being driven by the tour guide) {{stopped in front of the}} town bank while a bank robbery was in progress. Suddenly, a live bank robber named Kate Durango (if the cast member was female) or Kid Carson (if the cast member was male) appeared from inside the bank. After getting into a shoot-out with the town sheriff and chasing the tour guide into the bank, the bandit set the town bank ablaze with TNT and hijacked the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Following this scene, the remainder of the attraction was the same for both the #1A and #2B <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{the ride}} is in operation, a motor causes the arms to spin, with {{centrifugal}} forces causing the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> to fly outwards. Each <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{is equipped with a}} large rudder, allowing riders to control the motion of their vehicle. The minimum rider height requirement is usually 36 inches tall or more.|$|R

The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> move into the rain scene, moved from the second to last scene in Florida's to the second scene in California's. Most of the things at this point are identical to Florida's version. The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> move into the shortened Tigger scene, before moving to Pooh's bedroom where a similar part to that in Florida's version concurs.|$|R

50|$|The attraction's motorbike-styled {{vehicles}} {{were created by}} Walt Disney Imagineering {{as a method of}} specializing individual rider experience. The ride was then given a Tron-theme because the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> resembled the lightcycles featured in Tron: Legacy. When aboard the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle,</b> riders lean forward and grip a set of handlebars. A pad situated behind the seat secures the rider in place.|$|R

50|$|Imagineers {{are governed}} by a few key {{principles}} when developing new concepts and improving existing attractions. Often, new concepts and improvements are created to fulfill specific needs. Many solutions to problems are designed in this way, such as the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> of the attraction Soarin' Over California. The Imagineers knew they wanted guests to experience the sensation of flight, but were {{not sure how to}} accomplish the task of loading the people onto a <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> in an efficient manner where everyone had an optimal viewing position. Imagineer Mark Sumner found an Erector set in his attic, and was able to envision and design a <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> that would effectively simulate hang gliding.|$|R

5|$|The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> are themed to {{look like}} cars from a classic dark ride, and like the {{previous}} Back to the Future attraction, the vehicles feature fake wheels and gull-wing doors. Each dome features 12 8-passenger <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> arranged with 3 cars on the first level, 5 on the second and 4 on the third. Each vehicle is mounted on a motion platform atop a scissor lift, which raises the vehicle 9 feet into the dome. The motion platforms are capable of a total motion of three feet. In addition to the motion-based <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles,</b> riders also feel water effects, smoke, mist, and experience lighting effects and scents. As of 2017, the smoke and water effects only work on a few vehicles at the Florida location.|$|R

50|$|On 21 July 2013, {{the ride}} was closed again for review. More {{than a year}} passed before Resorts World Sentosa {{announced}}, in November 2014, that Battlestar Galactica: Human vs Cylon would reopen in early 2015 with new trains. On 25 May 2015, Universal Studios Singapore announced that the ride will return with all-new <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> on 27 May 2015. The ride was reopened officially two days later, with the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> being changed from four-abreast seating to two-abreast seating.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} attraction had 10 <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> which were intended to represent not the [...] "one and only" [...] Dumbo, but the alcohol-induced [...] "pink elephants" [...] scene from the film. In fact, the working title of the attraction was [...] "10 Pink Elephants On Parade" [...] and the elephants were painted pink on installation. Walt Disney objected, not wishing Disneyland's guests to <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> themed to a hallucination and thereby ordered them painted grey.|$|R

50|$|For {{the grand}} finale, when both the #1A and #2B <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> were in use, they both entered a dark theatre where they lined up {{side-by-side}} {{and came to}} a stop in front of a large movie screen. There, Osbourne or the tour guide concluded the tour with a three-minute film montage of classic film moments. At the conclusion of the film, both <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> exited the theatre lined up single-file again and returned to the 1930s soundstage where the ride concluded.|$|R

5000|$|Next, as the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{continued}} into a seemingly abandoned spaceship, Osborne identified {{it as the}} Nostromo, the doomed spaceship from Alien. The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> passed an audio-animatronic Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) holding a flamethrower as she prepared to confront a creature lurking within the ship. Guests could also hear Jones, Ripleys pet cat, meowing in the darkness, {{as well as the}} Nostromos [...] "Mother" [...] computer warning of an imminent ship self-destruction countdown. Hearing this, the gangster or the bandit became nervous and sped the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> through the ship, but not before the Alien appeared and attacked the guests, popping out from both the ceiling and the wall.The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> next entered a scene set in an ancient Egyptian tomb filled with snakes. Osborne informed guests that they were in a scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark as audio-animatronic figures of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) struggled to lift the Ark of the Covenant. A second room within the temple featured a large altar {{in the form of the}} ancient Egyptian god Anubis. Near the top of the altar, a large priceless jewel was being watched over by a cloaked temple guard. The gangster or the bandit saw the jewel, stopped the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and disembarked to take it. Before touching the jewel, the temple guard gave a warning that those who disturbed the treasure of the gods must pay with their life. Ignoring the warning, the gangster or the bandit reached to grab the jewel. Suddenly, a plume of fiery smoke shot from the ground engulfing the temple altar (as the temple guard left, undressing to reveal that the temple guard was the original tour guide while doing so before reappearing from the shadows). When the smoke clears, the skeletal corpse of hijacker was revealed and the tour guide re-boared the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> and continued on with the show.|$|R
