60|$|The {{faculty of}} <b>re-solution</b> is {{possibly}} much invigorated by mathematical study, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely {{on account of}} its retrograde operations, has been called, as if par excellence, analysis. Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse. A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at the other. It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by a the elaborate frivolity of chess. In this latter, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The attention is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat. The possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen. To be less abstract--Let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be expected. It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherché movement, the result of some strong exertion of the intellect. Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself {{into the spirit of}} his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometime indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation.|$|E
50|$|The simple phenols are not {{the only}} active element in wood-tar creosote. In solution, they {{coagulate}} albumin, which is a water-soluble protein found in meat; so they serve as a preserving agent, but also cause denaturation. Most of the phenols in the creosote are methoxy derivatives—they contain the methoxy group linked to the benzene nucleus (O - CH3). The high level of methyl derivates created from the action of heat on wood (also apparent in the methyl alcohol produced through distillation) make wood-tar creosote substantially different from coal-tar creosote. Guaiacol is a methyl ether of pyrocatechin, while creosol is a methyl ether of methyl-pyrocatechin, the next homolog of pyrocatechin. Methyl ethers differ from simple phenols in being less hydrophilic, caustic and poisonous. This allows meat to successfully be preserved without tissue denaturation, and allows creosote {{to be used as a}} medical ointment.Because wood-tar creosote is used for its guaiacol and creosol content, it is generally derived from beechwood rather than other woods, since it distills with a higher proportion of those chemicals to other phenolics.

40|$|This is a {{comprehensive}} study of two mechanisms of fission gas bubble <b>re-solution</b> in UO 2 by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations: homogeneous <b>re-solution</b> and heterogeneous <b>re-solution.</b> For the homogeneous mechanism, a hybrid approach is employed whereby Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to obtain the full recoil energy spectrum of fission gas atoms, and MD simulations are used to build an extensive library of fission gas atom <b>re-solution</b> events. This library is used for calculating a recoil spectrum averaged displacement distribution of fission gas atoms around bubbles.

The e-p coupling constant within the model is determined by comparing the sputtering yields deduced from the MD simulations with those obtained experimentally. Next, fission fragments tracks are simulated in a UO 2 sample containing one Xenon bubble.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 The {{need for}} cheap {{reliable}} energy, while simultaneously avoiding uranium supply constraints makes uranium carbide (UC) fueled Gas Fast Reactors offer an attractive nuclear reactor design. In {{order to qualify}} the fuel, an enhanced understanding {{of the behavior of}} uranium carbide during operation is paramount. Due to a reduced <b>re-solution</b> rate, uranium carbide suffers from a buildup of very large fission gas bubbles. While these bubbles serve to reduce total fission gas release through the trapping of diffusing gas atoms, they lead to high swelling and ultimately dominate the microstructure of the fuel. The bubble size distribution is determined by the competing absorption rate and the rate of knock-out, or <b>re-solution.</b> As a result of the enhanced thermal dissipative properties of uranium carbide fuel, the atom-by-atom knockout process was shown to be an accurate representation of <b>re-solution</b> in uranium carbide. Furthermore, the Binary Collision Approximation was shown to appropriately model the <b>re-solution</b> event, bypassing computationally expensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. The code 3 DOT was developed as an off-shoot of the code 3 DTrim, both of which utilize the TRIM algorithm to calculate the kinematics of ions traveling through a material. Benefiting from modern methods and enhanced computational power, the model created in 3 DOT results in a more fundamental understanding of the <b>re-solution</b> process in uranium carbide. A <b>re-solution</b> parameter that was an order of magnitude lower than previously determined was cal- culated in 3 DOT. A decrease in the <b>re-solution</b> parameter as a function of radius occurred for low bubble radii, with a nearly constant <b>re-solution</b> parameter for bubble radii above 50 nm. Through comparative studies on the <b>re-solution</b> parameter for various values of implantation energy and atomic density in the bubble, we found that while the <b>re-solution</b> parameter did change slightly, the overall shape did not. A new application, BUCK, was built using the MOOSE framework to simulate the fission gas bubble concentration distribution. In order to build a bare-bones foundation, the simplistic yet historically prevalent physics {{that can be used to}} model fission gas bubble nucleation, growth, and knock-out were implemented as stepping stones until more advanced models for each physical process can be created. As the first step towards models that are based on first-principles, the new <b>re-solution</b> parameter was included and tested within BUCK. BUCK was tested using different parameters and behaved normally. However, from studies using representative simulation parameters, it is clear that the currently implemented theory does not adequately identify the growth mechanism that leads to larger bubbles. While this currently limits the applicability of BUCK in a full fuel pin calculation, it provides the baseline structure in which new physics can be implemented, and represents an important step towards understanding the complex behavior of fission gas bubbles...|$|E

In terms of creep deformation and stress relaxation, using the constant-stress creep aging and constant-strain stress relaxation aging tests, the relationship between initial temper and CAF formability is investigated for an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy at 165 °C for 18 h. Three tempers are selected as the initial tempers in CAF, viz., solution, retrogression and <b>re-solution.</b> The CAF formability of this alloy with initial temper of retrogression is the best, and the creep strain of the retrogression tempered specimen after creep aging of 18 h is about 1. 21 and 1. 34 times {{than that of the}} solution and the <b>re-solution</b> tempered specimens, respectively. The calculated stress exponents of this alloy with three initial tempers range from 7. 3 to 9. 5, indicating that the CAF of this alloy is mainly controlled by the dislocation creep. The various formability for three initial tempers are attributed to different inhibitions of the transgranular precipitates on the dislocation movement. For the retrogression temper, the initial fine and uniformly distributed precipitates are seriously coarsened after 6 h of CAF, which minimally inhibit the dislocation movement. While, for the <b>re-solution</b> temper, the fine precipitates are re-precipitated in the matrix of the alloy, which observably hinder the dislocation movement and lead to the worst formability...|$|E

The aim is to provide real-time feedback of stress contours to the engineer as the geometry is dynamically modified.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityA computer model for the simulation of long-term, steady-state fission gas behavior in carbide fuels has been written assuming fission gas bubbles remain stationary. The model assumes that fission gas release occurs entirely through gas atom diffusion in the matrix solid and that fission gas bubbles grow as the net result of gas atom precipitation into the bubbles from the matrix solid and gas atom <b>re-solution</b> from the bubbles into the matrix. Further, assuming that local gas atom redistribution process in the immediate neighborhood of a bubble is very rapid, the bubble size is assumed to correspond to the equilibrium size that maintains exact balance between the rate of gas atom <b>re-solution</b> and that of gas atom precipitation. The model includes {{the treatment of the}} effect of attachment between bubbles and second-phase precipitates. The experimentally observed faster growth rate of precipitate bubbles is simulated using a reduced <b>re-solution</b> parameter for precipitate bubbles. With the grain matrix assumed to be spherical, the model allows the computation of the radial distribution of the sizes of the intragranular bubbles and the gas atom concentration in the matrix from which the swelling due to all intragranular gas atoms can be obtained. Taking into consideration the trapping effect of intragranular bubbles on gas atom migration toward the grain boundary, the flux of gas atoms arriving at the grain boundary is computed from which the gas atom distribution on grain boundary area together with its associated swelling can be obtained. The continual growth of grain boundary butbles resulting from the accumulation of gas atoms on the grain boundary will soon lead to grain boundary interlinkage and all gas atoms that subsequently reach the grain boundary are assumed to be released. Similarly, all gas atoms generated following the interlinkage of intragranular bubbles are also assumed to be immediately released. Application of the model indicates that fission gas swelling is largely due to intragranular bubbles. Grain boundary bubbles, although very large in size, contribute very little to the fission gas swelling and the contribution from gas atoms in solid solution in the matrix is even less significant with its absolute magnitude depending un reactor irradiation conditions. The results further indicate that only regions in the immediate neighborhood of the grain boundary are affected by gas release. Sensitivity studies have been performed to study the effect of the variation in the values of the various physical parameters entering the model with the values of the parameters being varied to cover the whole range of experimental data. The <b>re-solution</b> parameter is found to have the strongest influence on the results predicted by the model. The final selection of the values of the parameters has been {{based on the results of}} the sensitivity studies together with comparisons between the predicted results and experimentally observed swelling and gas release data of carbide fuels. Computation runs performed with the model using carefully chosen combinations of parameters have successfully reproduced the spread of experimental gas release data. The values of the parameters have been chosen to closely represent the physical characteristics, of the irradiation samples. Careful comparisons between the results of the calculations and the experimental data readily identify the grain size, and not the temperature, as the dominant factor affecting gas release. If allowance is made for the uncertainties of the experimental data, the fission gas swelling predicted by the model also correlates very well with experimentally observed fuel swelling data. The spread of the fuel swelling data, however, indicates that fuel cracking, and not fission gas swelling alone, very often contribute significantly to the fuel external dimensional changes. The linear fission gas swelling rate predicted by the model exhibits a behavior that is almost linear with temperature. This result correlates well with the linear swelling rate obtained from experimental swelling data if immersion density data alone are used in order to eliminate the sources of uncertainties associated with fuel cracking. The model seems to be capable of describing the fission gas behavior in carbide fuels. It also demonstrates the possibility of quantitatively incorporating the effect of fuel stoichiometry in a general fission gas swelling model. Although the development of the model is strongly oriented toward uranium carbide fuels, the general principles are relevant to other carbide fuels such as Pu-carbide or mixed-carbides provided the conditions necessary for the validity of the assumptions are satisfied...|$|E

Representative maximum variations, in atoms per unit formula of the smectite type based on 22 negative charges, are 0. 09 for St, 0. 03 for AI, 0. 015 for Fe, 0. 07 for Mg, 0. 03 for Na, and 0. 01 for K...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} a number of efforts to develop new {{approaches}} to the <b>re-solution</b> of international conflict, based on a social-psychological model and involving di-rect, unofficial communications under third-party auspices. The present paper discusses one such approach, consisting of problem-solving workshops in which representatives of conflicting national groups are brought together for face-to-face communication in a relatively isolated setting, free from govern-mental and diplomatic protocol. The basic format calls for more or less unstructured discussions, taking place in the presence and under the guidance of social scientists who are knowledgeable both about group process and about conflict theory. 5 etting, agenda, ground rules, procedures, and third-party interventions are designed to counteract the accusatory, legalistic, and conflict-expressive atmosphere that usually characterizes inter-actions between conflicting parties and to promote, instead, a task-oriented, analytical approach. Such an atmosphere, it is assumed, has the potential for producing changes in the participants ’ perceptions and attitudes v An earlier version of this paper was presented by Herbert C. Kelman at a symposiun honorin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a physically-based engineering model to estimate radiation hardening of 9 %Cr-steels under both displacement damage (dpa) and helium. The model is essentially {{based on the}} dispersed barrier hardening theory and the dynamic <b>re-solution</b> of helium under displacement cascades but incorporating a number of assumptions and simplifications [Trinkaus, J. Nucl. Mater. 318 (2003) 234 - 340]. As a result, the kinetics of the damage accumulation kept fixed, its amplitude is fitted on one experimental condition. The model was rationalized on an experimental database that mainly consists of similar to 9 %Cr-steels irradiated {{in the range of}} 50 - 600 degrees C up to 50 dpa and with a He-content up to 5000 appm. The test temperature effect is taken into account through a normalization procedure based on the change of the Young's modulus and the anelastic deformation that occurs at high temperature. Despite the large experimental scatter, inherent to the variety of the material and irradiation as well as testing conditions, the obtained results are very promising. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The retina {{consists}} of multiple cellular and synaptic layers and is nourished by two distinct (retinal and choroidal) circulations bounding the retina, separated by an avascular layer. High spa-tiotemporal resolution, layer-specific MRI of the retina remains challenging due to magnetic inhomogeneity-induced artifacts. This study reports passband balanced steady-state free-pre-cession (bSSFP) MRI at 453453500 mm and 1. 6 s temporal <b>re-solution</b> to image the mouse retina, overcoming geometric distortion and signal dropout while maintaining rapid acquisi-tion and high signal-to-noise ratio. bSSFP images revealed multiple alternating dark-bright-dark-bright retinal layers. Hypoxic (10 % O 2) inhalation decreased bSSFP signals {{in the two}} layers bounding the retina, corresponding to the retinal and choroidal vasculatures. The layer in between showed no substantial response and was assigned the avascular photore-ceptor layers. Choroidal responses (225. 966. 4 %, mean 6 SD, n 56) were significantly (P< 0. 05) larger than retinal vascular responses (211. 662. 4 %). bSSFP offers very high spatiotempo-ral resolution and could have important applications in imaging layer-specific changes in retinal diseases.

40|$|Carbon felt is a {{potential}} material for electrochemical reduction of chromates. Very dilute solutions may be efficiently treated due to its large specific surface area and high porosity. In this work, the up-scaling of this technology is investigated using {{a new type of}} separated cell and once-through flow of industrial rinse water. A significant enhancement of the process is obtained due to copper deposition during long-term operation. The co-deposition and <b>re-solution</b> of copper occurs depending on the inlet chromate concentration. When previously deposited copper is present a current-free reduction of chromate takes place resulting in current efficiencies apparently above 100 %. Very high space time yields are obtained even for effluents at low concentration and optimised conditions (high flow rates and pH 2). The economic feasibility of the technology is also considered. Continuous, single-pass operation results in lower energy requirements than batch processing. The economic potential of the process is also evaluated in comparison with chemical detoxification of chromate. The operating costs for the electrochemical treatment of very dilute effluents on a carbon felt electrode are 30 % lower than for the chemical method...|$|E
40|$|We have {{produced}} Rydberg atoms in a lithium atomic beam using cw dye lasers, and developed {{the technology for}} detecting these atoms with electric field ionization. These advances have brought us close {{to the point where}} we can start carrying out high <b>re-solution</b> measurements on highly excited atoms in a strong magnetic field by cw laser spectroscopy. Understanding the diamagnetic spectrum of an atom with a single valence electron presents a formidable challenge to theory and experiment. ' The classical and quantum mechanical equations of motion are easily constructed, but in spite of the simplicity of the problem the solutions are elusive and our understanding is far from complete. Numerical techniques have been applied to both the classical 2 and quantum 3 dy-namics, but the results possess features which are difficult to interpret. Construction of an approximate constant of motion is a promising method for predicting the spectrum of a hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic field. 4 Our primary task is to measure the level anticrossing sizes and linewidths in the diamagnetic spectrum of atomic lithium, for these can establish the credibility of such an operator. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} for inferring the orientation of fish {{through the use of}} broadband-acoustic signals. The method takes advantage of the high range resolution of these signals, once temporally compressed through cross-correlation. The temporal resolution of these compressed signals is inversely proportional to the bandwidth, thus the greater the bandwidth the higher the resolution. This process has been applied to broadband-chirp signals spanning the frequency range 40 – 95 kHz to obtain a range <b>re-solution</b> of approximately 2 cm from the original, unprocessed resolution of about 50 cm. With such high resolution, individual scattering features along the fish have been resolved, especially for angles well off normal incidence. The overall duration of the compressed echo from live, individual alewife, as measured in a laboratory tank, is shown to increase monotonically with orientation angle relative to normal incidence. The increase is due to the greater range separation relative to the transducer between the echoes from the head and tail of the fish. The results of this study show that with a priori knowledge of the length of the fish, the orientation could be estimated from the duration of a single, compressed broadband echo. This method applies to individual, acoustically resolved fish. It has ad...|$|E
40|$|Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument (LLRI) {{proposed}} for the first Indian lunar mission Chandrayaan- 1 is aimed to study the topography of the Moon’s surface and its gravitational field by precisely measuring the altitude from a polar orbit around the Moon. Altimetry data close to the poles of the Moon would also be available from the instrument, which was not covered by earlier missions. This instrument supplements the terrain mapping camera and hyper-spectral imager payloads on Chandrayaan- 1. The instrument consists of a diode pumped Nd:YAG pulsed laser transmitter having 10 nsec pulse width and a receiver system. The receiver system features 17 cm diameter Ritchey–Chrétien collecting optics, Si Avalanche Photo Detector (APD), preamplifiers, constant fraction discriminators, time-of-flight measurement unit and spacecraft interface. Altimeter <b>re-solution</b> of better than 5 m is targeted. The received signal strength of LLRI depends on laser pulse backscatter from the Moon’s surface. Moon’s surface being a poor reflector, the choice of receiver size and its type and the selection of detector {{play an important role}} in getting a good signal-to-noise ratio and in turn achieving the target resolution. At the same time, the spacecraft puts a limitation on payload size and weight. This paper discusses the proposed LLRI system for Chandrayaan- 1 and signal-to-noise ratio estimation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Photoacoustic {{microscopy}} (PAM), whose {{spatial resolution}} and maximum imaging depth are both scalable, has made great progress in recent years. However, each PAM system currently achieves only one resolution with an associated maximum imaging depth. Here, we present an integrated optical-resolution (OR) and acoustic-resolution (AR) PAM system implemented by delivering light via an optical fiber bundle. A single fiber core {{is used to}} deliver light for OR illumination {{in order to achieve}} a small spot size and hence high lateral resolution, whereas all the fiber cores are used to deliver more energy for AR illumination. Most other components are shared by the OR and AR imaging. The lateral resolution can be seamlessly switched between 2. 2 and 40 μm as the maximum imaging depth is switched between 1. 3 and 3. 0 mm. The system enables automatically coregistered higher-resolution OR and deeper AR photoacoustic imaging. © 2012 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 170. 3880, 170. 5120. Due to its optical absorption contrast and high spatial <b>re-solution</b> that is scalable with the maximum imaging depth, photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has been successfully applied to in vivo imaging at scales from organelles to organs [1, 2].

40|$|America, and its brines {{are some}} of the most {{concentrated}} anywhere in the world. The lake occupies a closed basin system whose chemistry reflects solute inputs from the weathering of a diverse suite of rocks in its drainage basin. GSL is the remnant of a much larger lacustrine body, Lake Bonneville, and it has a long history of carbonate deposition. Inflow to the lake is from three major rivers that drain mountain ranges to the east and empty into the southern arm of the lake, from precipitation directly on the lake, and from minor groundwater inflow. Outflow is by evaporation. The greatest solute inputs are from calcium bicarbonate river waters mixed with sodium chloride-type springs and groundwaters. Prior to 1930 the lake concentration inversely tracked lake volume, which reflected climatic variation in the drainage, but since then salt precipitation and <b>re-solution,</b> primarily halite and mirabilite, have periodically modified lake-brine chemistry through density stratifi-cation and compositional differentiation. In addition, construction of a railway causeway has restricted circulation, nearly isolating the northern from the southern part of the lake, leading to halite precipitation in the north. These and other conditions have created brine differentiation, mixing, and fractional precipitation of salts as major factors in solut...|$|E
