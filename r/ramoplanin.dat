40|$|The natural {{progression}} from {{the introduction of}} an antibiotic into the market {{to the emergence of}} resistant strains demands the constant influx of new drugs to treat infection. <b>Ramoplanin</b> A 2, a drug with demonstrated resistance against antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, is currently in clinical trials. <b>Ramoplanin</b> is composed of seventeen amino acids condensed with a N-acylated fatty acid tail and a sugar moiety. The biosynthesis of this important metabolite is performed by a host of enzymes including non-ribosomal peptides synthetases, fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes, glycosyltransferases, and other tailoring enzymes. In the introductory chapter, the significance and mechanism of the family of <b>ramoplanin</b> antibiotics will be discussed. The biosynthetic cluster of the lipoglycodepsipeptide <b>ramoplanin</b> and its sister antibiotic enduracidin will be outlined and the previous work on this cluster summarized. The proposed formation of the critical N-acylated tail and the parallels to fatty acid biosynthesis will also be described in detail. Chapter two describes the development of an expression system to successfully isolate proteins of interest from the <b>ramoplanin</b> biosynthetic cluster. In addition to increasing the yields of proteins already expressing in heterologous hosts, this technique facilitated the isolation of previously unattainable proteins. This chapter also details the demonstration of their activity through a variety of biochemical techniques. Chapter three details the kinetic characterization of Ramo 16, a NAD-dependent &# 946;-ketoacyl reductase, critical for the formation of the N-acylated fatty acid chain attached to <b>Ramoplanin.</b> Sequence analysis and characterization of the product of the Ramo 16 reaction also implies that the biosynthesis of the N-acylated tail of <b>ramoplanin</b> bears significant similarity to type II bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis. These observations have led to a new proposal for the biosynthesis of the N-acylated fatty acid attached to <b>ramoplanin.</b> Further supporting these conclusions, chapter four details the examination of the stereochemistry of the hydrogen removed from the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor and the stereochemistry of the product of the enzymatic reaction. Chapter five describes the 1. 4 Å crystal structure of <b>ramoplanin</b> in the presence of CTAB, an amphipathic membrane phospholipid mimetic. Observation of the location of the N-acylated fatty acid allows interpretation of its critical role in the activity of <b>ramoplanin.</b> The formation of the dimer and the interactions between the two molecules of <b>ramoplanin</b> and <b>ramoplanin</b> and the surroundings were examined in detail and supported earlier structure activity relationships. These observations have led to a new model for <b>ramoplanin</b> and Lipid II recognition {{in the context of the}} bacterial membrane. Enduracidin, ramoplanin's sister antibiotic, is produced by S. fungicidicus. Development of fermentation conditions for this strain allowed the isolation of appreciable amounts of enduracidin and 15 N-labeled enduracidin, which was used to examine enduracidin's binding to Park's nucleotide, a cell wall precursor to Lipid II, by 2 D 1 H- 15 N HSQC NMR. Although chemical shifts in the HSQC spectrum indicated binding, insoluble fibril formation complicated interpretation and necessitated the use of crystallography to determine the interaction with the substrate. Initial crystal conditions have been determined and diffraction images have been collected at 3. 0 Å. Higher resolution images are pending to determine this structure. Finally, chapter six discusses the development of a technique to transform S. fungicidicus and introduce plasmids to obtain deletion and insertional disruption mutants. A high throughput PCR screen was determined to enable large batch screening of potential mutants. This technique may be applied to study the function of genes in the pathway by fermenting production of enduracidin and examining the results. Dissertatio...|$|E

In this study we have determined the function of the putative mannosyltransferase encoded by ram 29 from the <b>ramoplanin</b> biosynthetic gene cluster. Bioinformatics revealed that Ram 29 is an integral membrane protein with a putative DxD motif that is suggested to bind to, and activate, a polyprenyl phosphomannose donor and an extracytoplasmic C-terminal domain that is predicted to bind the <b>ramoplanin</b> aglycone acceptor. The ram 29 gene was cloned into the tetracycline inducible plasmid pMS 17 and integrated into the genome of the enduracidin producer S. fungicidicus.

40|$|The {{prevention}} of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization and infection con-tinues to {{be a high}} priority for clinicians. An oral antimicrobial agent that reduces or eliminates VRE gastrointestinal colonization could be useful for preventing VRE infection in selected patients. <b>Ramoplanin,</b> a glycolipodepsipeptide, is the first in a new class of antimicrobials. It has excellent in vitro activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Entero-coccus faecalis. It is orally administered, and not absorbed systemically. In clinical trials, VRE gastrointestinal colonization was reduced to undetectable levels in 80 – 90 % of patients during receipt of <b>ramoplanin.</b> A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicentre study is currently being conducted to determine whether <b>ramoplanin</b> will prevent VRE bloodstream infection in oncology patients who are neutropenic due to treatment for a haematological malignancy or a bone marrow/stem cell transplant...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} one {{isolates}} of Enterococcus species isolated recently from hospitalized patients were evaluated in vitro for antibiotic susceptibility. Teicoplanin and mideplanin {{were the most}} active agents, followed by <b>ramoplanin,</b> vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, and imipenem. High-level resistance to gentamicin (MIC > 500 micrograms/ml) and/or streptomycin (MIC > 2, 000 micrograms/ml) was found in 60 isolates. High-level resistance to ampicillin (MIC > or = 16 micrograms/ml) was found in 17 isolates. MBC studies revealed that <b>ramoplanin</b> possesses significant bactericidal activity...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{activity}} of <b>ramoplanin,</b> a cyclic lipoglycopeptide, against 92 vancomycin-resistant gram-positive organisms was evaluated. <b>Ramoplanin</b> demonstrated potent activity against many highly vancomycin-resistant organisms including enterococci (MICs for 90 % of strains tested of 0. 5 micrograms/ml) and against Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., and Pediococcus spp., {{all of which}} were inhibited at concentrations of < or = 0. 25 micrograms/ml. This drug or a derivative compound merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for infections due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of teicoplanin, daptomycin, <b>ramoplanin,</b> and PD 127, 391, a new quinolone, {{were compared with}} that of vancomycin. Teicoplanin showed the lowest MICs against Enterococcus faecalis. <b>Ramoplanin</b> was slightly more active than the other peptide antibiotics against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of the four peptide antibiotics were similar for the oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus. Daptomycin had good activity against staphylococci but was the least active agent against E. faecalis. The MICs of vancomycin against all isolates were in general higher than those of the new antibiotics, with the exceptions of the MICs of daptomycin against E. faecalis and teicoplanin against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. PD 127, 391 was the most active agent against all staphylococcal isolates...|$|E
40|$|By using broth microdilution, 373 {{clinical}} isolates of staphylococci {{were studied}} {{to determine their}} susceptibilities to CI- 960, WIN 57273, ciprofloxacin, mupirocin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and <b>ramoplanin.</b> Test strains comprised 179 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 194 strains of coagulase-negative species. Strains of S. aureus were susceptible to CI- 960, which had a mode MIC of 0. 032 micrograms/ml and an MIC for 90 % of the strains of 2 micrograms/ml. CI- 960 was equally active against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus strains as well as ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. Similarly, WIN 57273 was highly active, with a mode MIC of 0. 008 micrograms/ml and an MIC for 90 % of the strains of 1 micrograms/ml. No cross-resistance to CI- 960 and WIN 57273 among ciprofloxacin-resistant strains was detected. Mupirocin was four- to eightfold more active than <b>ramoplanin,</b> vancomycin, and teicoplanin. With regard to coagulase-negative staphylococci, CI- 960 and WIN 57273 were the most active of the test compounds, inhibiting all strains at 0. 5 and 1 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against the same strains, mupirocin was fourfold more active than <b>ramoplanin</b> and eightfold more active than vancomycin. Five strains of S. haemolyticus {{were found to be}} resistant to ciprofloxacin, while resistance to teicoplanin was found among strains of S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. saprophyticus, S. simulans, S. warneri, and S. xylosus...|$|E
