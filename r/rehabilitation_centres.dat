500|$|While {{urbanisation}} {{can pose}} a threat to koala populations, the animals can survive in urban areas provided enough trees are present.

Wildlife caretakers are issued special permits, but must release the animals back into the wild when they are either well enough or, in the case of joeys, old enough. As with most native animals, the koala cannot legally be kept as a pet in Australia or anywhere else.|$|E
