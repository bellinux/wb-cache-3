40|$|Levels and Dronkers (2006) {{showed that}} {{educational}} achievement differs between immigrant students from different <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (Latin America, Northern Africa, and Western Asia). This follow-up paper establishes whether {{these differences in}} educational achievement between immigrant students from different <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> {{can be explained by}} school segregation, whether along ethnic or socioeconomic lines. Ethnic and socioeconomic school segregation have a negative influence on the scholastic achievement of all students, although the impact of socioeconomic school segregation is greater than that of ethnic school segregation. Ethnic school segregation affects the scholastic outcomes of native and immigrant students from some <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> more than those of immigrant students from other regions. The analysis shows that neither ethnic, nor socioeconomic, school segregation explains the lower mathematics achievement of immigrant students from Latin America, Northern Africa, and Western Asia...|$|R

40|$|Mostly due to {{the lack}} of {{suitable}} data, cross-national research on the integration of migrant pupils is still scarce. We aim to fill this gap by addressing the question of the extent to which native and first- and second-generation migrants from various <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> living in thirteen different countries of destination, differ in their scholastic ability. Using the PISA 2003 data, we focus primarily on the impact <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and destination effects on the scholastic achievement of migrants. The results indicate that family characteristics and origin and destination effects can offer a significant contribution to the explanation of difference in scholastic knowledge between natives and first- and second-generation migrants. However, certain primary origin and destination effects, as well as interactions between these and family characteristics, remain significant and substantive after controlling for family characteristics, suggesting serious integration problems in the case of migrants from a few <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in some European countries of destination. ...|$|R
