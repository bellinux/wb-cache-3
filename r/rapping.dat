Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles' house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Támar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor. With Knowles and Rowland, Girl's Tyme attracted nationwide attention: west-coast R producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles' vocals because Frager thought she had personality {{and the ability to}} sing. With efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time. However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, their choice of song was wrong; they were actually <b>rapping</b> instead of singing.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rap</b> 1 and <b>Rap</b> 2 {{are closely}} related {{proteins}} of the Ras family of small G-proteins. <b>Rap</b> 1 is well known to regulate cell-cell adhesion. Here, we have analysed the effect of Rap-mediated signalling on endothelial permeability using electrical impedance measurements of HUVEC monolayers and subsequent determination of the barrier resistance, which is a measure for {{the ease with which}} ions can pass cell junctions. In line with its well-established effect on cell-cell junctions, depletion of <b>Rap</b> 1 decreases, whereas activation of <b>Rap</b> 1 increases barrier resistance. Despite its high sequence homology with <b>Rap</b> 1, depletion of <b>Rap</b> 2 has an opposite, enhancing, effect on barrier resistance. This effect can be mimicked by depletion of the <b>Rap</b> 2 specific activator RasGEF 1 C and the <b>Rap</b> 2 effector MAP 4 K 4, establishing <b>Rap</b> 2 signalling as an independent pathway controlling barrier resistance. As simultaneous depletion or activation of both <b>Rap</b> 1 and <b>Rap</b> 2 results in a barrier resistance comparable to control cells, <b>Rap</b> 1 and <b>Rap</b> 2 control barrier resistance in a reciprocal manner. This <b>Rap</b> 1 -antagonizing effect of <b>Rap</b> 2 is established independent of junctional actin formation.

Using a pull-down assay, active GTP-bound <b>rap</b> 1 was up-regulated in SCC compared to normal or immortalized keratinocytes. Because both <b>rap</b> 1 A and <b>rap</b> 1 B isoforms of <b>rap</b> 1 are expressed in SCC, the <b>rap</b> 1 GAP inactivation of both <b>rap</b> 1 isoforms was verified using cells transfected with EGFP-rap 1 A or EGFP-rap 1 B or co-transfected with FLAG-tagged <b>rap</b> 1 GAP. The results demonstrate that expression of <b>rap</b> 1 GAP in oropharyngeal SCC down-regulated active <b>rap</b> 1, ERK activation, and proliferation. Incubation of stably transfected SCC cells with nocodazole, an inhibitor of mitosis, caused a slower accumulation of <b>rap</b> 1 GAP-transfected cells in the G 2 phase, in comparison to the vector control, indicating that <b>rap</b> 1 GAP-transfected cells have slower progression through the cell cycle. This was supported by down-regulation of cyclin D 1, cdk 4, and cdk 6 in <b>rap</b> 1 GAP-transfected SCC cells. Furthermore, SCC cells transfected with <b>rap</b> 1 GAP produced significantly smaller tumors in nude mice as compared to controls (P < 0. 01).

5|$|Hip hop is a {{cultural}} movement, of which music is a part, along with graffiti and breakdancing. The music is composed of two parts, <b>rapping,</b> the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals, and DJing, the production of instrumentation either through sampling, instrumentation, turntablism or beatboxing. Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in The Bronx, New York City.

In New York, DJs like Kool Herc played records of popular funk, disco and rock songs. Emcees originally arose to introduce the songs and keep the crowd excited and dancing; over time, the DJs began isolating the percussion breaks (the rhythmic climax of songs), thus producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over.|$|E

40|$|Within the Ras {{superfamily}} of GTPases, <b>Rap</b> 1 and <b>Rap</b> 2 are {{the closest}} homologs to Ras. In non-neural cells, <b>Rap</b> signaling can antagonize Ras signaling.

Moreover, active <b>Rap</b> 1 and <b>Rap</b> 2 cause loss of surface AMPA receptors and reduced miniature EPSC amplitude and frequency in cultured neurons. The role of <b>Rap</b> signaling in vivo, however, remains poorly understood. To study the function of <b>Rap</b> 2 in the brain and in behavior, we created transgenic mice expressing either constitutively active (<b>Rap</b> 2 V 12) or dominant-negative (<b>Rap</b> 2 N 17) mutants of <b>Rap</b> 2 in postnatal forebrain.
