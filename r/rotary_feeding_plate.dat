40|$|The {{positioning}} accuracy of <b>rotary</b> <b>feed</b> system under load greatly {{depends on the}} static stiffness of mechanical transmission system. This paper proposes a unified static stiffness model of <b>rotary</b> <b>feed</b> system with geared transmission system. Taking the torsional stiffness of transmission shaft and mesh stiffness of gear pairs into account, the motion equations of the whole transmission system are presented. Based on the static equilibrium, a unified expression {{for the relationship between}} torsional angles of two adjacent elements is derived. Then a unified static stiffness model is presented. Furthermore, analytical expressions for sensitivity analysis of the static stiffness on the individual element’s stiffness and design parameters are derived. The presented model is verified by a traditional model, and a good agreement is obtained. The influence of phase angle of meshing gear pairs on the resultant static stiffness is investigated. An example transmission system is employed to perform the sensitivity analysis and the results are analyzed. The proposed model provides an essential tool for the design of <b>rotary</b> <b>feed</b> system satisfying requirement of static stiffness. ...|$|R

The first phase of the experiment was a randomized block with six treatments: A - pellets at the end of the pelletizer machine; B - pellets inside the truck; C - truck's discharging at the feed silo; D - place inside the warehouse after the feed silo; E - the middle of the <b>feed</b> <b>plate</b> line and F - the end of the <b>feed</b> <b>plate</b> line.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{analytical}} model that could be used by the designers of a <b>rotary</b> <b>feeding</b> and cutting system (RFCS) to identify the power demand of the RFCS with limited or no required field or laboratory data. Two separate RFCS were investigated, incorporated with either a low-speed cutting process (LSCP) or a high-speed cutting process (HSCP). The results from the laboratory and field trials were used to create and validate the analytical model. Laboratory tests were completed with the LSCP RFCS and these concluded that counter-knife sharpness, serrations and bevel angle all had significant effects on the specific energy required by the LSCP RFCS when processing cereal straw and alfalfa. The specific energy required by the LSCP RFCS, while processing cereal straw, increased by 0. 35 kW∙h/tonne (or 96 %) when the sharpness of the counter-knives decreased from 0. 13 to 0. 63 mm (where the sharpness was recorded by the leading-edge-width of the counter-knives). With the same decrease in sharpness, the specific energy required by the LSCP RFCS while processing alfalfa increased by 0. 04 kW∙h/tonne (or 32 %). The specific energy required by the LSCP RFCS while processing cereal straw with sharp counter-knives (counter-knives with a leading edge width of 0. 13 mm) increased by 0. 11 kW∙h/tonne (or 51 %) when serrated counter-knives were used instead of un-serrated counter-knives. However, counter-knife serrations did not have a significant effect on the specific energy demand of the LSCP RFCS when sharp counter-knives were used to process alfalfa. The increase in bevel angle from 15 to 90 ° caused the specific energy required to process cereal straw and alfalfa to approximately triple. The moisture content of alfalfa also had a significant effect on the specific energy required to process alfalfa with the LSCP RFCS. The specific energy demand of the LSCP RFCS was at a maximum when alfalfa at a moisture content of 53 % on a wet basis (w. b.) was processed and decreased slightly (approximately 0. 04 kW∙h/tonne or 10 %) when dryer and wetter alfalfa was processed. Field tests were completed with the HSCP RFCS and it was concluded that in general, there was a direct relationship between the specific energy required by the HSCP RFCS and the moisture content of the straw, counter-knife engagement and throughput. Further, it was also concluded that the specific energy requirements of the HSCP RFCS were more sensitive to counter-knife engagement when higher moisture content straw was processed. Depending on the type of chopper used, the specific energy required by the HSCP RFCS increased anywhere from 0. 15 to 0. 77 kW∙h/tonne (or 22 to 61 %) when the counter-knife engagement was increased from 0 to 100 % (or fully removed to fully engaged). Again, depending on the type of chopper used, when the moisture content of the straw processed by the chopper increased from approximately 7 to 25 % w. b. the specific energy required by the chopper increased by 0. 14 to 0. 96 kW∙h/tonne (or 28 to 84 %). The effect of throughput on the specific energy demand of the HSCP RFCS was dependent on the type of chopper used. For one of the choppers, an increase in throughput from 10. 5 to 13. 5 tonne/h caused the specific energy required by the HSCP RFCS to increase by 0. 24 kW∙h/tonne (or 35 %); however for a different chopper, an increase in throughput from 12 to 13 tonne/h caused the specific energy demand of the HSCP RFCS to decrease by 0. 16 kW∙h/tonne (or 19 %). The analytical model was validated using a subset of the data that were collected while employing each cutting device under field conditions and the data collected with the use of a custom-designed material properties test stand. The output of the analytical model fell within the 95 % confidence interval of the measured power demand for each of the <b>rotary</b> <b>feeding</b> and cutting systems, and the analytical model was therefore deemed sufficiently accurate. Based on the analytical model, the total power demand of both the LSCP and HSCP <b>rotary</b> <b>feeding</b> and cutting systems was largely attributed to the power required to transport plant material. Further, the power required to transport the plant material along the sides of the counter-knives was much greater than the power required to transport the plant material along the rotor bed and along the leading edge of the tines. Because of the excessive power required to transport plant material along the sides of the counter-knives, three techniques were identified as potential strategies to decrease the power demand of the RFCS. The first technique involved removing half of the tines from the RFCS, and modifying the remaining tines to decrease the amount of plant material that is entrapped between sides of the counter-knives and the tines. The second technique involved coating the inside surface of the tines with a baked Teflon, to decrease the coefficient of friction between the plant material and the RFCS. The third technique involved reshaping the counter-knives, to decrease the surface area over which plant material was transported along the side of the counter-knives. According to the analytical model, employing any of the three techniques would result in the total power demand of the RFCS to decrease by 15 to 26 %. For the HSCP RFCS, a stochastic model was developed to identify which of the four choppers tested during field trials would have the best performance when subjected to the same operating conditions. The chopper with the best performance was the WR chopper as its use resulted in the minimum geometric mean length of material exiting the combine harvester while also consuming the least amount of specific energy...|$|R
40|$|A {{graphical}} design {{method is}} proposed for estimating {{the number of}} theoretical contact stages for ternary separation operations under conditions of nonideality. The required thermodynamic data are arranged for constant pressure operations to give the equilibrium relationship and enthalpies of the vapour and liquid mixtures. Graphical constructions are made on charts containing these data starting from material and enthalpy operating points, for which generalized formulae are given, valid for such separation devices as the rectifier, stripper, absorber, distillation column, with any number of feeds and/or side drawoffs. The method takes into account nonidealities arising from changing equilibrium constants and changing molal flow rates with composition, and is rigorous {{to the extent of}} the limit of readability of the chart. In general the usual algebraic computation for a theoretical stage is reduced to the construction of three straight lines. A discussion is given on the trial-and-error procedure involved in assigning proper terminal conditions to actual design problems for ternary separation operations from the viewpoint of analysis of variables. The condition existing at the <b>feed</b> <b>plate</b> is described in relation both to compositions of the streams in the adjacent sections and to the thermal condition of the feed. The graphical construction and the discussion on variables are illustrated with examples on the separation of liquid air, including the case of a double distillation column...|$|R
