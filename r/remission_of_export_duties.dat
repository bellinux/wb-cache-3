40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} analysis of the impacts of trade policy reforms in Sri Lanka. A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is constructed with detailed description of the domestic production structure and foreign trade. The model is then used to investigate the effects of trade policy reforms on resource allocation and welfare. ^ Prior to 1977, Sri Lanka maintained stringent control over its imports through rigid quantitative restrictions. A new economic policy reform package was introduced in 1977, and it shifted Sri Lanka 2 ̆ 7 s development strategy toward an export oriented policy regime. The shift of policy focus from a restrictive trade regime toward a more open trade regime is expected to {{have a significant impact on}} the volume of external trade, domestic production structure, allocation of resources, and social welfare. ^ Simulations are carried out to assess the effects of three major policy reforms: (1) a devaluation of the Sri Lanka rupee, (2) a partial or a complete elimination <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>duties,</b> and (3) a devaluation-cum-removal <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>duties.</b> ^ Simulation results indicate that the macroeconomic impact of a devaluation-cum-removal <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> can be substantial. They also suggest that the resource-pull effects of a devaluation and a devaluation-cum-export duty removal policy are significant. However, the model shows that a devaluation combined with an <b>export</b> <b>duty</b> reduction is likely to be a superior strategy. ...|$|R

40|$|The current World Trade Organization (WTO) regime on export {{restraints}} comprises two extremes: {{at one end}} is the near-complete {{freedom to}} levy <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> enjoyed by most Members, which renders theWTO discipline on export restrictions largely ineffective; at the other end, the rigid obligations imposed on several acceding Members prohibiting the use <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> for any purpose. The recent WTO ruling in China-Raw Materials has only solidified the latter extreme. This article seeks to expose the irrationality of the current regime, especially the problems created by the rigid obligations of the several acceding Members. It contends that such obligations deprive these Members of their ownership right to claim {{a larger share of}} their natural resources for domestic use and of an effective tool for managing environmental externalities associated with the resource products exported. The virtual immutability of such obligations is at odds with the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources. To rectify these problems, this article proposes integrating all stand-alone export concessions into General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) schedules, which would provide the acceding Members with the policy space and flexibility available under the GATT. It is also submitted that the key to gaining support from developing countries {{for the establishment of a}} system-wide discipline lies in the recognition of legitimate functions <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>duties.</b> Rather than pushing for their elimination, the WTO should aim to regulate <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> in the same manner as its regulation of import duties...|$|R

40|$|Prices for {{commodities}} such as {{minerals and}} metals have increased significantly {{over the past few}} years. At the same time, there has also been an increase in restrictions on the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> raw materials which has led policy makers and business people to address free trade of raw materials. This paper provides information on the present situation regarding the use <b>of</b> <b>export</b> restrictions and international disciplines on these measures. Export restrictions are maintained to achieve diverse policy objectives, including environmental protection or conservation of natural resources, promotion of downstream processing industries, controlling inflationary pressures, and for fiscal receipts reasons. Export restrictions take various forms such as <b>export</b> <b>duties,</b> quantitative restrictions, and licensing requirements. The number <b>of</b> countries applying <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> over the period 2003 - 2009 was higher than in previous years and that such duties were introduced primarily by developing and least developed countries. Under the current WTO rules, unlike quantitative export restrictions which are in principle prohibited, there is no substantive discipline on <b>export</b> <b>duties,</b> although there have been efforts to revise this at the multilateral and bilateral levels. The WTO accession process imposes several disciplines. Export restrictions have also been discussed during the DDA negotiations in both NAMA (Non-Agricultural Market Access) and agriculture negotiations. Several regional trade agreements (RTAs) went beyond the WTO by including prohibition <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>duties.</b> <b>Export</b> restrictions, by creating a differential between the price available to domestic processors and the price charged to foreign processors, provide domestic processing industries with an advantage. Although several governments apply export restrictions to achieve diverse policy objectives, not all rely on such restrictions. Alternative policy options with different trade impacts are used. In view of the significant impacts <b>of</b> <b>export</b> restrictions on global supply chains, transparency on the use and implementation of such measures should be substantially improved. transparency, quantitative restrictions, accession, export licensing, food security, conservation of natural resources, subsidy, raw materials, terms-of-trade, fiscal receipts, trade policy review, Doha Development Agenda, regional trade agreements, <b>export</b> restrictions, <b>export</b> <b>duties,</b> social objectives, tariff escalation, non-agricultural market access, WTO disciplines...|$|R

The reformation of the Russian forest sector did not begin favourably in 2008 – 2012, as all of the essential indicators showed that the situation in both forestry and the forest industry had continued to weaken since the year 2007. 120 priority investment ventures had been officially approved by the beginning of 2013, of which 27 have been completed or started. At this point, it is evident that the great majority of these undertakings will not come to fruition in line with the original goals.

40|$|I {{analyze the}} system of taxes imposed on the Russian oil sector {{before and after the}} tax reform of 2002. I first {{establish}} a price parity relation explaining the gap between the world and domestic prices through <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> and alternative transportation costs. Based on it, I argue that the indirect taxes (VAT, the sales and excise taxes) do not decrease the net profits of oil producers, but are mostly shifted onto consumers. The tax burden on producers, on the other hand, consists <b>of</b> the <b>export</b> <b>duties,</b> resource payments, the profit tax and the property tax. I show that the tax reform had little effect on the total amount of taxes imposed on producers, but changed its structure across the types of taxes. After the reform the share of efficiently collected taxes, most importantly the extraction tax (ET), increased, explaining higher tax revenues. Finally, I estimate {{the extent to which the}} extraction tax is economically inefficient. By showing that the deadweight loss associated with ET is only a small fraction of the generated tax revenues, I argue that ET is a better choice for capturing the natural rent in the Russian oil sector than the poorly controlled profit tax. On the whole, this evidence depicts the reform of oil taxation in 2002 as a big step forward of the Russian fiscal system. This report is a shorter English version of the paper "Estimating the tax burden in the Russian oil sector under the price parity hypothesis" (Ekonomika i Matematicheskie Metody (2005), 41, 3). ...|$|R

50|$|Following Holland's example, {{stamp duties}} were adopted in 1694, being {{extended}} in 1698 and large amounts {{were added to}} the excise. Breweries and distilleries were placed under charge and important commodities such as salt, coal, malt, leather and glass were included as taxable articles, the two latter being later removed. Similarly, customs rates were also increased. In 1698 the general 5% duty was raised to 10%. French goods became liable to surtaxes, first at 25%, then 50%, whilst goods from other countries were charged at a lesser amount. Moreover, spirits, wines, tea and coffee were taxed at special rates.The expansion of the fiscal system may be best realised from the fact that, during the comparatively short reign of William III (1689-1702), the land tax produced £19,200,000, customs raising £13,296,000, and excise £13,650,000, or approximately £46 million when added together. In the last year of the reign, returns from these taxes were respectively - land tax (at 2s.), £990,000, customs £1,540,000, excise £986,000, or a total exceeding £3.5 million.
