40|$|Many {{researchers}} have reported on spin filters using linear Rashba spin-orbit interactions (SOI). However, spin filters using square and cubic Rashba SOIs {{have not yet}} been reported. We consider that this is because the. Aharonov-Casher (AC) phases acquired under square and cubic Rashba SOIs are ambiguous. In this study, we try to derive the AC phases acquired under square and cubic Rashba SOIs from the viewpoint of non-Abelian SU(2) gauge theory. These AC phases can be derived successfully from the non-Abelian SU(2) gauge theory without the completing square methods. Using the results, we investigate the spin filtering in a double quantum dot (QD) Aharonov-Bohm (<b>AB)</b> <b>ring</b> under linear, square, and cubic Rashba SOIs. This <b>AB</b> <b>ring</b> consists of elongated QDs and quasi-one-dimensional quantum nanowires under an external magnetic field. The spin transport is investigated from the left nanowire to the right nanowire in the above structure within the tight-binding approximation. In particular, we focus on the difference of spin filtering among linear, square, and cubic Rashba SOIs. The calculation is performed for the spin polarization by changing the penetrating magnetic flux for the <b>AB</b> <b>ring</b> subject to linear, square, and cubic Rashba SOIs. It is found that perfect spin filtering is achieved for all of the Rashba SOIs. This result indicates that this <b>AB</b> <b>ring</b> under general Rashba SOIs can be a promising device for spin current generation. Moreover, the <b>AB</b> <b>rings</b> under general Rashba SOIs behave in totally different ways in response to penetrating magnetic flux, which is attributed to linear, square, and cubic behaviors in the in-plane momentum. This result enables us to make a clear distinction between linear, square, and cubic Rashba SOIs according to the peak position of the perfect spin filtering...|$|R

30|$|Recently, an Aharnov-Bohm (<b>AB)</b> <b>ring</b> device, {{in which}} one or two quantum dots (QDs) having RSOI are located in its arms, is {{proposed}} to realize the spin-polarized transport. The QDs is a zero-dimensional device where various interactions exist and is widely investigated in recent years for its tunable size, shape, quantized energy levels, and carrier number [14 – 16]. A QDs ring has already been realized in experiments [17] and was used to investigate many important transport phenomena, such as the Fano and the Kondo effects [18, 19]. When the RSOI in the QDs is taken into consideration, the electrons flowing through different arms of the <b>AB</b> <b>ring</b> will acquire a spin-dependent phase factor in the tunnel-coupling strengths and results in different quantum interference effect for the spin-up and spin-down electrons [10, 13, 20, 21].|$|R

Under certain circumstances, a pure spin-up or spin-down conductance can be obtained when a spin-unpolarized current is injected from the external leads.
