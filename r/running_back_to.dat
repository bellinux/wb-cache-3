5|$|As the day progresses, Rick's son Carl (Chandler Riggs) becomes {{restless and}} sneaks {{into the barn}} to observe Randall; Randall tries to {{convince}} Carl to release him. Shane discovers Carl's presence and scolds him. Outside, Carol (Melissa McBride) attempts to cheer Carl up by reminding him Sophia is in heaven, but he lashes out at her. Carl ends up taking a gun from Daryl's stash and heading into the nearby swamp alone. He finds a walker half-stuck in mud, and taunts it by throwing rocks at it and then moves in close to shoot it in the head. The walker suddenly frees one of its legs and lurches forward; Carl panics and drops the gun before <b>running</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> camp, not telling anyone what happened. Meanwhile, Beth (Emily Kinney) has since recovered from her earlier suicide attempt. When Glenn (Steven Yeun) comes {{to check on her}} condition, Hershel (Scott Wilson) gives him a family heirloom representing his approval of Glenn's relationship with his daughter Maggie (Lauren Cohan).|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} North Korean attack started {{most of the}} 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, fled its positions. One company at a time, the {{battalion}} was struck with strong attacks all along its front, and {{with the exception of}} a few dozen men in each company, each formation quickly crumbled, with most of the troops <b>running</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Haman against the orders of the officers. The North Koreans passed through the crumbling US lines quickly and overran the 2nd Battalion command post, killing several men there and destroying much of the battalion's equipment. With the 2nd Battalion broken, Haman was open to direct North Korean attack. As the North Koreans encircled Haman, Roberts, the 2nd Battalion commander, ordered an officer to take remnants of the battalion and establish a roadblock at the south edge of the town. Although the officer directed a large group of men to accompany him, only eight did so. The 2nd Battalion was no longer an effective fighting force. Pockets of its soldiers remained in place and fought fiercely, but the majority fled upon attack, and the North Koreans were able to move around the uneven resistance. They surrounded Haman as the 2nd Battalion crumbled in disarray.|$|E

50|$|With {{a running}} style {{based on his}} great strength, Brockington epitomized the power <b>running</b> <b>back</b> - a player who {{preferred}} to break tackles and run over defenders rather than run away from them.

Davis finished 5th and 2nd in Heisman voting in his 1995 and 1996 campaigns respectively. McCarney would go 10–34 in his first four seasons as the Cyclones head coach.|$|E
