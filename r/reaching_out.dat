5|$|About a {{month before}} the race took place, in February 2015, the race organisers {{published}} a publicity poster for the race.

The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"). This was a reference to Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he pinched the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after the race.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of a brief school-based intervention on help-seeking behaviour among Australian adolescents. The aim of the intervention was to encourage adolescents to seek help, focusing on the use of the <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> website (www. reachout. com. au) as a help-seeking source. Male and female adolescents were compared. The evaluation involved 243 students from ten government and non-government schools across rural and regional Victoria. They received a presentation that contained information on <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!,</b> what to do if they or a friend was going through a tough time, and help-seeking options. Questionnaires assessing help-seeking knowledge, intentions, behaviour, and use of <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> to seek help were administered six months following the presentations. The majority of participants, with more females than males, knew where to go for help and who they could talk to. Almost half of the participants had been to the <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> website following the presentation, and approximately two-thirds reported that they would use <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> to seek help if they were going through a tough time. There were no significant gender differences in visiting <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> or in intending to visit it. The results demonstrate that young people in Australia are likely to use the Internet, and especially <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!,</b> to seek help when they are going through tough times...|$|R

5|$|Born in Huntington on Long Island, Whitman {{worked as}} a journalist, a teacher, a {{government}} clerk, and—in addition to publishing his poetry—was a volunteer nurse during the American Civil War. Early in his career, he also produced a temperance novel, Franklin Evans (1842). Whitman's major work, Leaves of Grass, {{was first published in}} 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> to the common person with an American epic. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health further declined. When he died at age 72, his funeral became a public spectacle.|$|E

5|$|Puzzlejuice is a 2012 indie puzzle {{video game}} for iOS {{produced}} and developed by video game company Sirvo. The {{game is a}} combination of Tetris, tile-matching, and Boggle: players rearrange falling tetromino blocks into rows of similar colors, which turn into letters that are cleared from the board by forming words. The fast-paced game also includes challenges and power-ups. The development team consisted three people; programmer Asher Vollmer initially developed the game alone, before <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> to artist Greg Wohlwend for advice on the aesthetics.

Associating with the leftist Schools' Action Union (SAU) founded {{in the wake of the}} 1968 student protests, he encouraged members of the Brixton branch of the Black Panther Party to join Labour. His involvement in the SAU led to his dismissal from the PFTCC student's union, who disagreed with politicising secondary school pupils.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevailing}} design philosophy for A Realm Reborn was {{to simultaneously}} appeal to hardcore MMORPG players while <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> to new players and Final Fantasy fans {{who had never}} experienced the genre before. As a consequence, Yoshida held optimizing gameplay for controllers as a top priority. To streamline development, he made about 400 fundamental design decisions which eliminated time lost to getting approvals, {{with a focus on}} implementing standard features of the genre first. The new workflow pipeline was tested using updates to the original game and applied to development of A Realm Reborn. The continuing operations of the original release also provided a valuable testing ground for new features that would be carried into the relaunch. Throughout this process, Yoshida emphasized that communication with players and restoring their trust was key, even admitting that sales were secondary compared to redeeming the reputation of the series. Live streaming conversations between the development team and fans, such as the Letters from the Producer LIVE events, became a major element of Yoshida's player outreach strategy.|$|E

5|$|Extending the police's {{presence}} {{across the}} region was logistically challenging, requiring {{the creation of a}} network of new posts and the use of steamers to move supplies around the coast. It proved to be a harsh existence for the force, particularly when deliveries of supplies were delayed by bad weather. Work began on a railroad to Hudson Bay in 1908, continuing for two decades, which, although it required substantial police assistance, gradually eased the challenge of supplying the police outposts around the bay. The police opened temporary detachments around York Factory in 1912, and then at Port Nelson in 1913, where the police established their divisional headquarters. Patrols pushed up into Baker Lake and along the Coppermine River until, {{by the end of the}} decade, the police presence in Hudson Bay had been reduced to a bare minimum, with the force focusing on <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> into ever more remote areas.|$|E
5|$|Fifty {{people are}} interviewed in the film, {{including}} investigative journalist Paul Radu of Bucharest, Katherine Chon of the Polaris Project, and Iana Matei of <b>Reaching</b> <b>Out</b> Romania. Don Brewster of Agape International Missions {{says that all}} of the girls they have rescued from child sex tourism in Cambodia identify Americans as the clients who were the most abusive to them. The film was dedicated to Richard Young, its cinematographer and co-director, after he died in December 2010. It had its premiere the following month at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. The narration was completely rerecorded in 2011, replacing Ashley Judd's voice with that of Glenn Close. The version of the film that was aired by CNN International as part of the CNN Freedom Project was shorter than the version shown at the premiere. In 2014, a re-edited version of the film was released.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{women in}} America were <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> for greater {{control of their}} lives. Husbands and fathers {{directed}} the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 {{as an attempt to}} find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.|$|E

5|$|On 1 October 1944, Alejandro Cordova, {{the editor}} of El Imparcial, the main {{opposition}} newspaper, was assassinated. This led to the military coup plotters <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> to {{the leaders of the}} protests, in an attempt to turn the coup into a popular uprising. Ponce Vaides announced elections, but the pro-democracy forces denounced them as a fraud, citing his attempts to rig them. Ponce Vaides sought to stabilize his regime by playing on inter-racial tension within the Guatemalan population. The most vocal support for the revolution had come from the Ladinos, or people of mixed racial or Spanish descent. Ponce Vaides sought to exploit their fear of the Indians by paying thousands of indigenous peasants to march in Guatemala City in his support, and promising them land if they supported the Liberal party that Ubico had begun as a front for the dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|One {{animator}} {{was dedicated}} full-time during {{three years of}} the game's development to work out the boy's animations, including animations that showed anticipation on the player's actions or events in the game, such as <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> for a cart handle as the player moved the boy near it. Jensen felt this was important as the character was always {{at the center of the}} player's screen, and the most important element to watch. Playdead included gruesome death sequences to highlight incorrect solutions and discourage players from repeating their mistakes. While they expected players to run the boy into numerous deaths while trying solutions, Carlsen stated that their goal was to ensure death wasn't a penalty in the game, and made the death animations entertaining to keep the player interested. Carlsen noted several early puzzles were too complex for the game, but they would end up using a portion of these larger puzzles in the final release.|$|E
5|$|Tactile {{communication}} (touch) {{is mostly}} used by lemurs {{in the form}} of grooming, although the ring-tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), reaches out and touches adjacent members, and cuffs other members. <b>Reaching</b> <b>out</b> and touching another individual in this species {{has been shown to be}} a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.|$|E
