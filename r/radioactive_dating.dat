5|$|The Chicxulub Crater lends {{support to}} the theory {{postulated}} by the late physicist Luis Alvarez and his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, that the extinction of numerous animal and plant groups, including non-avian dinosaurs, may have resulted from a bolide impact (the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event). Luis and Walter Alvarez, at the time both faculty members at the University of California, Berkeley, postulated that this enormous extinction event, which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the Chicxulub crater, could {{have been caused by}} just such a large impact. The age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago, the end of the Cretaceous period, and the start of the Paleogene period. It coincides with the K–Pg boundary, the geological boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene. The impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, including the worldwide extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. This conclusion has been the source of controversy. In March 2010, 41 experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: 20 years' worth of data spanning a variety of fields. They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions at the K–Pg boundary. In 2013 a study compared isotopes in impact glass from the Chicxulub impact with the same isotopes in ash from the boundary where the extinction event occurred in the fossil record; the study concluded that the impact glasses were dated at 66.038 ± 0.049 Ma, and the deposits immediately above the discontinuity in the geological and fossil record was dated to 66.019 ± 0.021 Ma, the two dates being within 19,000 years of each other, or almost exactly the same within experimental error. The theory is now widely accepted by the scientific community. Some critics, including paleontologist Robert Bakker, argue that such an impact would have killed frogs as well as dinosaurs, yet the frogs survived the extinction event. Gerta Keller of Princeton University argues that recent core samples from Chicxulub prove the impact occurred about 300,000 years before the mass extinction, and thus could not have been the causal factor. However, this conclusion is unsupported by <b>radioactive</b> <b>dating</b> and sedimentology.|$|E

At that time the specific evolutionary mechanism which Darwin provided of natural selection was actively disputed by scientists in favour of alternative theories such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis. Darwin's gradualistic account was also opposed by saltationism and catastrophism. Lord Kelvin led scientific opposition to gradualism {{on the basis of}} his thermodynamic calculations that the Earth was between 24 and 400 million years old, and own views favoured a version of theistic evolution accelerated by divine guidance. [...] This age of the earth was disputed by geological estimates, which gained strength in 1907 when <b>radioactive</b> <b>dating</b> of rocks showed that the Earth was billions of years old. [...] The specific hereditary mechanism Darwin hypothesized of pangenesis that supported gradualism also lacked any supporting evidence and was disputed by the empirical tests of Francis Galton.

With the discovery of radioactive decay the age of the Earth was pushed back even further. Arthur Holmes, was a pioneer of geochronology. In 1913 Holmes was on the staff of Imperial College, when he published his famous book The Age of the Earth in which he argued strongly in favour of the use of <b>radioactive</b> <b>dating</b> methods rather than methods based on geological sedimentation or cooling of the earth (many people still clung to Lord Kelvin's calculations of less than 100 million years). Holmes estimated the oldest Archean rocks to be 1,600 million years, but did not speculate about the Earth's age. By this time the discovery of isotopes had complicated the calculations and he spent the next years grappling with these. His promotion of the theory over the next decades earned him the nickname of Father of Modern Geochronology. By 1927 he had revised this figure to 3,000 million years and in the 1940s to 4,500±100 million years, based on measurements of the relative abundance of uranium isotopes established by Alfred O. C. Nier. The general method is now known as the Holmes-Houterman model after Fritz Houtermans who published in the same year, 1946.

To examine the latest event that occurred in these segments, we investigated the dates and elevations of fossilized intertidal tubeworms along the northern coast of the Noto Peninsula, located on the hanging-wall sides of the faults, using <b>radioactive</b> carbon <b>dating</b> and global positioning measurements. For each fossil, we calculated {{the difference between the}} past and present elevation, thereby estimating the elevation of the sea level at the date of the fossil, using a curve for sea level change. This calculation provided us with the elevation change at each site. The vertical changes estimated from the elevations and ages of the intertidal tubeworms revealed that the coastal emergence probably occurred between 1600 and 1800 AD. This area of coastal emergence lies adjacent to active faults within the Wajima-oki segment. A model for rectangular faults with three fault planes and a moment magnitude of 6. 6 for the Wajima-oki segment reproduced the observed pattern of coastal emergence well. Only one damaging earthquake, that in 1729, is known to have occurred {{in this part of the}} northern Noto Peninsula between 1600 and 1800 AD, and there has not been one since 1800 AD. The slip distribution of the fault predicted by the model is consistent with the distribution of shaking-related damage documented in 1729.

Determination of stellar parameters and element abundances was based on analysis of high-quality VLT/UVES spectra. The surface gravity was calculated from the NLTE ionisation balance between Fe I and Fe II. Accurate abundances were determined {{for a total of}} 38 elements, including 22 neutron-capture elements beyond Sr and up to Th. This object is deficient in carbon, as expected for a giant star with Teff < 4800 K. The stellar Na-Zn abundances are well fitted by the yields of a single supernova of 14. 4 Msun. For the neutron-capture elements in the Sr-Ru, Ba-Yb, and Os-Ir regions, the abundance pattern of HE 2252 - 4225 is in excellent agreement with the average abundance pattern of the strongly r-process enhanced stars CS 22892 - 052, CS 31082 - 001, HE 1219 - 0312, and HE 1523 - 091. This suggests a common origin of the first, second, and third r-process peak elements in HE 2252 - 4225 in the classical r-process. We tested the solar r-process pattern based on the most recent s-process calculations of Bisterzo et al. (2014) and found that elements in the range from Ba to Ir match it very well. No firm conclusion can be drawn about the relationship between the fisrt neutron-capture peak elements, Sr to Ru, in HE 2252 - 4225 and the solar r-process, due to the uncertainty in the solar r-process.

The nature of the polluting species as well as their time distributions are of primary importance with respect to identifying the polluting sources. Sediments are the most frequently used materials in such studies. Sediments act as the ecological memories of the environments of their formation. Besides classical chronological methods, radiochronological methods developed recently gave a big impetus to environmental pollution studies. One of the key radioisotopic technique is to utilize 210 Pb, a product of the 235 U <b>radioactive</b> series to <b>date</b> the last 200 years of the sediments. A number of supporting indicators are also utilized. One of them being anthropogenic 137 Cs which is used as a time-marker. Large amounts of 137 Cs radioactivity was released to the environment during 1954 - 1963, in time of the most intense atmospheric nuclear arms testing and again in 1986 during the Chernobyl nuclear accident. These intense 137 s activities form time-markers throughout sediment cores corresponding to their release years. During our studies extending over several years we have used radiochronological methods in dating several sediment cores from Zurich and Constance Lakes in Switzerland from east coast of Spain, Sea of Marmara, from the Black Sea region, Southern coast of Turkey and from North Cyprus.

However, precise chronological constraints on, their formation are {{required in order to}} investigate the climatic and paleo-environmental conditions that prevailed during and after their formation, and to improve our understanding of the, physical and chemical conditions that promoted their development and preservation. Moreover, these authigenic calcium carbonate precipitates provide us with an interesting test of the U-Th <b>radioactive</b> disequilibrium <b>dating</b> method, the reliability of which has been demonstrated extensively in aragonitic corals and calcitic continental speleothems, but which remains much more questionable in highly porous, chemically and mineralogically complex media such as soil profiles. We report here U- 238 -U- 234 -Th- 230 radioactive disequilibrium analyses measured by Thermo-Ionization Mass Spectrometry in calcretes from two sites in southwest India. Since calcretes are impure carbonates mixed with various amounts of parent rock and weathered minerals, all ages must be computed using the isochron technique, involving the extraction of several coeval subsamples from the same soil horizon and U-Th analyses after total dissolution (TSD) method, in order to correct for the detrital component. Th- 232 is usually used as index of the detrital contamination, and the isochron age is derived from the isotopic composition (Th- 230 /U- 238; U- 234 /U- 238) of the pure authigenic carbonate end-member of the mixing line. Our results show that each set of samples taken from decimetric blocks is characterized by a well-defined isochron line in a 3 -D Osmond diagram (Th- 232 /U- 238; Th- 230 /U- 238; U- 234 /U- 238). The regression lines obtained for most of the samples show probabilities of fit satisfying the mathematical assumptions of the isochron model (in most cases 0. 05), and mean square weighted deviations (MSWD) values around 1. The compositions of the end-members are highly variable between the different isochrons, both for the carbonate phase, indicating various ages of cristallisation, and for the detrital phase, indicating various origins and compositions. Notably, our data demonstrate that the detrital component is in all cases out of secular equilibrium, by contrast with the standard paradigm of "dirty carbonate" dating, which {{is based on the assumption}} of average continental crust Th/U elemental ratio, and secular equilibrium values of the ((Th- 230 /U- 238) and (U- 234 /U- 238) ratios. At the first site (Coimbatore), we obtain U-Th ages between 304 +/- 38 ka and 44 +/- 2. 9 ka (2 sigma) from the base to the top of the profile. These suggest discontinuous precipitation of the different fades in good agreement with micro morphological observations. At the second study site (Gundlupet), the carbonate nodules sampled from two different profiles, yield consistent ages of 200 ka, which suggests that precipitation of nodular carbonate occurred across the entire pediment toposequence during a single event. Surprisingly, in mere contradiction with the standard model of impure carbonate dating, two puzzling samples display "vertical isochrons", i. e., variable Th- 232 /U- 238 without any variation of the Th- 230 /U- 238 and U- 234 /U- 238 ratios. Such patterns require extremely high Th- 232 /U- 238 ratios, in an as yet unidentified detrital phase. Taken at face value, these results suggest that no clear correlation can be inferred between the precipitation of these pedogenic carbonates and major orbitally-driven climate variations recorded in other archives during the last glacial/interglacial cycles...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of nuclear}} {{technologies}} has left an indelible mark on American society. The environmental, political, economic, and social costs of creating, producing, and utilizing technologies such as nuclear weapons and nuclear energy have left a legacy of <b>radioactive</b> waste. To <b>date,</b> there is no comprehensive path for disposing of {{the different kinds of}} waste produced by the nuclear industry, including spent nuclear fuel that is now held on site at nuclear power plants. The question of how to deal with nuclear waste has plagued the nuclear industry, governmental agencies, and the concerned public for most of the nuclear era. There is one permanent geologic repository in the U. S., called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), located in the salt beds outside of Carlsbad, New Mexico. Presently, WIPP is only allowed to hold low-level transuranic waste produced by military installations during the Cold War. This project looks at the ways that federal attention has turned to this remote site in the Chihuahuan Desert as a potential solution for storing high-level nuclear waste as well. Using ethnographies, archival research, and the ideas expressed at numerous public meeting held in the region, this project shows how nuclear communities are framed in discourses surrounding nuclear waste through the concept of nuclearism, which posits that nuclear technologies are wholly beneficial to society. Specifically, this project examines how concepts involving the immutability of nature and science interact to form problematic assumptions regarding the behavior of the environment in relation to nuclear waste. Furthermore, conversations that focus solely on the production of “sound science” ignore the political and social consequences of creating and moving nuclear waste across the country, ensnaring more communities into the web of potential nuclear consequences. Nuclear issues also intersect different scales, troubling the idea of local consent, the idea of a homogenous public, and whether nuclear technologies can be tools of democracy. The events at the Fukushima nuclear power plant on March 11, 2011 underscored the delicate balance of technology and nature, and showed the inherent vulnerabilities of complex technological systems. By connecting the complex natures of the desert, salt, radiation, and time together with questions of political representation, this project looks at how the nuclear future is being shaped in the desert of New Mexico.

Otkriveni su tragovi stambenih i radnih prostora zajednice koja se bavila poljoprivredom i stočarstvom te sitni arheološki nalazi koji ukazuju na postojanje zajednice koja je koristila robu lokalne proizvodnje, a u manjoj mjeri importe. Od srednjovjekovnih objekata pronađene su jame i stambeni objekti s keramikom, lijepom i šljakom, a naselje se datira u 9. st. po. Kr. Archaeological traces {{dating to}} Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages found {{west of the}} {{entrance}} to Virovitica, south of the Podravina road, during works on the western ring-road {{of the city of}} Virovitica. South of the site designated as Virovitica Kiškorija Jug are the northern slopes of the Bilogora Mountain. The location where the structures are concentrated is divided into two, which was probably caused by the soil configuration, so that the inhabitants used elevations for erecting buildings {{in order to avoid the}} water that accumulated after precipitation, but this division is also possible due to other factors, such as the social and economic structure of the village. According to the results of the <b>radioactive</b> carbon <b>dating</b> analysis, the Roman village functioned from the second century AD to the middle of the fifth century AD. It is characterized by structures made of wooden pillars and dried mud, pit dwellings, channels, fences, kilns, pits and various working areas. The community that lived here had its local production, and a small part of the products were purchased by trade from distant regions (bracelets, bronze dishes, jewellery, and glass). Ceramic products prevail, particularly coarse kitchenware, mostly nondecorated and simple shaped. The village owes its continued existence and functioning to the nearby main road connecting the west from Aquileia via Emona, Celeia, Poetovio, Iovia, with the east up from Mursa. Life in the village existed as long as the road, trade and life in the nearby settlements and towns that co-existed with the village functioned. There certainly are more such villages in the vicinity since they accompanied larger settlements, rustic villas and Roman roads. There are not many features from the Middle Ages, they are different and it is assumed that a large number of the settlement was destroyed by ploughing. This renders difficult any conclusions on the interior organization of the settlement, the interrelation of the constructions and the social structure of its inhabitants. The understanding of this medieval settlement becomes even more difficult due to the fact that the state of archaeological research in Northern Croatia is rather poor, but analogies from the area of Torčec in Podravina, a region to which this site belongs as well, are of crucial importance. The greatest part of finds in medieval structures accounts for pottery with wheel and wavy combed decoration, followed by daub which was part of the construction, metal finds, and the presence of dross suggests the existence of production activities. The structures lie approximately 20 m from each other. 14 C dates from medieval structures show that they originated in the ninth century. Residential structures, channels and pits were found, and this excavation included only a smaller part of the site streching farther east, where on an elevated terrace ceramic fragments and dark stains can be noticed. Such stains and pottery are found also to the west of the excavated zone, but to a smaller extent. Since the area is rather large, it is hard to say on the basis of a small part of the excavated settlement whether it functioned only in the ninth century...|$|R
