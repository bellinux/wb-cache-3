5000|$|Outside the citadel, {{above the}} 3 in {{armoured}} deck were {{a large number}} of small watertight compartments used to hold coal and stores. Between them and the hull were 4 ft compartments filled with cork and containing a 2 ft <b>coffer</b> <b>dam.</b> The dam was filled with oakum and canvas which had been shown to help reduce the size of the hole made by a projectile passing through the <b>coffer</b> <b>dam.</b> All of these materials were treated with calcium chloride to try to reduce their flammability. Experiments were carried out with [...] firing 64-pounder shells into full scale replicas of the cork compartments and <b>coffer</b> <b>dams.</b>|$|R
50|$|When the Oderteich {{is fully}} emptied {{the remains of}} <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> can be seen about 200 metres above the main dam. This was built in 1898 when the Oderteich Reservoir was empty {{in order to reduce}} the water flow whilst repairs were carried out to the bottom outlet. The <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> must have been {{demolished}} immediately after this repair had been completed.|$|R
40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1952, the maximum {{measured}} discharge of the Mississippi River occurred at the St. Anthony Falls Dam of the Northern States Power Company at Minneapolis, Minnesota. As {{a result of the}} high flow, considerable damage was done to the spillway surface and to the <b>rock-filled</b> <b>crib</b> supporting the structure. These model tests were initiated by the Northern States Power Company to determine a hydraulic design for a structure to replace the damaged spillway. Northern States Power Compan...|$|R

50|$|A <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> was {{constructed}} near the Glacial River Bridge that spans Jökulsárlón {{in order to}} build a row of protective measures of stone boulders to prevent any erosion of the foundation of the pillars of the bridge. This <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> enabled the Icelandic road administration to create workable access for the power shovel digger to place the row of stone protective measures, which would also divert the icebergs from hitting the bridge pillars and thus avoid damage to the structure.|$|R

50|$|The {{very next}} rainy season, however, brought further floods {{even worse than}} the {{previous}} year. Nyaminyami had struck again, destroying the <b>coffer</b> <b>dam,</b> the access bridge {{and parts of the}} main wall.|$|R
5000|$|First of all, a large <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> was built, {{constructed}} of {{two rows of}} steel plates between which a [...] of sand was tipped. Any water that seeped through was pumped away.|$|R
50|$|Construction on the Cabinet Gorge Dam {{began in}} 1951 by the Morrison Knudsen Corporation. The Clark Fork River {{had to be}} {{diverted}} with two <b>coffer</b> <b>dams</b> and speed was necessary because Spring flooding threatened the river diversion and <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> integrity. 32 tons of dynamite was used to blast 50,000 cubic yards of rock from the canyon walls in order to prep the construction site. Water was diverted through two 1000 ft tunnels, and a half-million cubic yards of earth was excavated from the site overall. Construction on the dam was complete in 1952 and the reservoir was filled in 1951, half the estimated time.|$|R
50|$|As of Oct 2013, the Google Maps {{satellite}} view (probably {{a year or}} more old) {{shows the}} construction site, with a small <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> a bit upstream of the point where the permanent dam is being built.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{possible}} to bring a steamboat down Sucker Creek from Sucker Creek to the Willamette River, if appropriate measures were taken, including {{the building of a}} <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> in the abandoned mill race. [...] James D. Miller did this with the Onward.|$|R
50|$|The 5 km long, 55 m high {{earthfill dam}} with {{composite}} masonry cum concrete spillway and undersluice structures, concrete diaphragm cut-off wall, rock excavation in foundation, diversion channel, <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> and appurtenant works at Tenughat {{was built for}} supply of water to Bokaro Steel Plant and the Bokaro industrial area.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of 25 Bank Street was undertaken by Canary Wharf Contractors, {{with an overall}} build time of 32 months. The geography of the site presented considerable access challenges {{in that it was}} surrounded by water on three sides, with two thirds of the fourth side in the former dock. A <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> was constructed in the dock to enable the water to be pumped out and a road was built on top of the dam, with earth ramps to enable construction traffic to reach the construction site.River traffic was extensively used to minimise road deliveries; consignments of aggregates and structural steel were delivered by barge and a concrete batching plant was constructed on a barge anchored in the dock. At the end of the project the <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> was removed and the fill loaded onto barges for removal.|$|R
25|$|Work began {{that summer}} with {{the removal of}} the south bank powerhouses. The {{existing}} dam was used as a <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> while workers poured concrete for the new dam. The new dam was finished on August 1, 1927, and began generating electricity in September. The new dam's reservoir completely drowned the old dam behind it.|$|R
30|$|These maps of {{vulnerability}} were integrated to the PCS as appendixes, and {{made available to}} participants for the second exercise in May 2016.

40|$|Flood routing is the {{technique}} of determining the flood hydrograph at a section of a river by utilizing the data of flood flow at one or more upstream sections. The hydrologic analysis of problems such as flood forecasting, flood protection, reservoir design and spillway design invariably include flood routing. In these applications two broad categories of routing can be recognized. These are reservoir routing and channel routing. In reservoir routing {{the effect of a}} flood wave entering a reservoir is studied. In channel routing the change {{in the shape of a}} hydrograph as it travels down a channel is studied. In this paper pick rate of runoff and risk of a <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> for different construction years are discussed. We found that peakrate depends on length of travel of water course and risk of <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> is more if it is designed for short time for long construction period...|$|R

5000|$|On 7 October 2013, there {{appeared}} to be a temporary <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> with filled sandbags across part of the river, immediately north of the point where the London Underground Picadiily Line (and four conduits carrying unknown services) crosses the river. A bulk road tanker labelled [...] "non hazardous product" [...] was seen with flexible hoses connected to the pool above the dam.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the dam at Ear Falls began {{in the spring of}} 1928, but not before camp buildings were constructed along {{the east side of the}} river. A <b>coffer</b> <b>dam,</b> two earth dikes, excavation and preparations of the foundations of the dam were also completed before construction began. The pouring of concrete commenced in November and work on the dam continued throughout the winter months.|$|R

50|$|Construction was {{at first}} ceased until November 1946 as President Harry S. Truman had halted funding for many {{government}} programs in order to handle a post-Second World War depressed economy. In 1947, diversion of the Savannah River and construction of a <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> began while the contract for the actual dam was awarded. The construction plant for the dam was also completed in 1947, containing equipment to create concrete that would be transported anywhere on the construction site via three-revolving gantry cranes with 124 ft. booms. In 1948, after the foundation was excavated, workers began to pour concrete on site for the spillway. In 1949, initial work on the concrete spillway was completed; the original <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> was removed and a second cofferdam was installed in order to restore {{the flow of the}} Savannah River to its original channel but now through eight-sluice gates in the spillway structure. Concrete operations on {{the main part of the}} dam had halted in 1949 because of a steel-strike but resumed in 1950 and much of the spillway was completed by the end of the year.|$|R

In 2006, he developed a trailer delivery system for installing cement boat ramps, involving the laying of connected cement planks directly into the water, thereby not polluting the waters with dissolved cement mortar or having to construct <b>coffer</b> <b>dams.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{lighters}} were 156 ft in length, 14 ft {{depth and}} 30 ft breadth and cost about £18,000 each to build. The hull included 10 oil tanks, separated by air spaces and <b>coffer</b> <b>dams,</b> which held {{a capacity of}} 550 tons of liquid fuel oil. Sleeping accommodation and a saloon were also provided in the forward portion. Two sets of diesel engines with centrigual pumps discharged the fuel oil from the tanks.|$|R
