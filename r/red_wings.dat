5|$|Due to pancreatitis, Crozier {{played only}} 58 out of 70 {{games for the}} <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> in 1966–67. His numbers were down as he won only 22 games and {{recorded}} a 3.35 GAA. The <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> missed the playoffs. After another bout of pancreatitis {{at the beginning of}} the 1967–68 season, Crozier announced his retirement due to stress and depression. His announcement was short-lived as after six weeks, he returned to hockey. Before re-joining the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings,</b> Crozier played five games with the Fort Worth Wings of the Central Professional Hockey League (CPHL) as conditioning. Crozier spent two more seasons on a mediocre <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> team before being traded to the newly formed Buffalo Sabres in 1970.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the Colorado Avalanche met the Detroit <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> in the Western Conference Finals {{and upset}} the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> 4–2. During Game 6, <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> player Kris Draper was {{checked into the}} boards face-first by Avalanche player Claude Lemieux. As a result, Draper had to undergo facial {{reconstructive}} surgery and had to have his jaw wired shut for five weeks. The incident {{marked the beginning of}} a rivalry often {{considered one of the most}} intense in NHL history by the press and fans.|$|E

40|$|Aggression between {{species is}} a seldom-considered but {{potentially}} widespread mechanism of character displacement in secondary sexual characters. Based on previous {{research showing that}} similarity in wing coloration directly influences interspecific territorial aggression in Hetaerina damselflies, we predicted that wing coloration would show a pattern of character displacement (divergence in sympatry). A geographical survey of four Hetaerina damselfly species in Mexico and Texas showed evidence for character displacement in both species pairs that regularly occurs sympatrically. Hetaerina titia, a species that typically has large black wing spots and small <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> spots, shifted to having even larger black spots and smaller <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> spots at sites where a congener with large <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> spots is numerically dominant (Hetaerina americana or Hetaerina occisa). Hetaerina americana showed the reverse pattern, shifting towards larger <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> spots where H. titia is numerically dominant. This pattern {{is consistent with the}} process of agonistic character displacement, but the ontogenetic basis of the shift remains to be demonstrated...|$|R

5|$|In the {{following}} season, {{in the last}} regular season meeting between the Avalanche and the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> on March 26, 1997, a brawl known as the Brawl in Hockeytown broke out. The game ended with nine fights, 11 goals, 39 penalties, 148 penalty minutes, one hat-trick (by Valeri Kamensky) and a goalie fight between Stanley Cup champion goalies Patrick Roy and Mike Vernon. Claude Lemieux {{was one of the}} players singled out by the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> players. The <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> ended up winning the game in overtime 6–5. The teams met again in the Western Conference Finals that season, with the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> emerging victorious and going on to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Canadiens and the Detroit <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> {{have won}} the trophy the most times, with 7 awards apiece. The team with the {{greatest}} number of unique winners are the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> with 4—Sergei Fedorov (twice), Steve Yzerman, Kris Draper, and Datsyuk (three times)—all coming since 1994.|$|E
5|$|The Penguins {{faced the}} Western Conference Champion Detroit <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> for the Stanley Cup. The best-of-seven series began in Detroit on May 24, the first series the Penguins {{opened on the}} road. It was the third Stanley Cup Final {{appearance}} for the Penguins franchise, the first since consecutive victories during the 1991 and 1992 Stanley Cup Finals. The <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> made their 23rd appearance, and first since 2002. The series ended on June 4 with the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> winning in six games.|$|E

40|$|Using Lyα {{emission}} line as a tracer of high redshift star forming galaxies, hundreds of Lyα {{emission line}} galaxies (LAEs) at z > 5 have been detected. These LAEs {{are considered to}} be low mass young galaxies, critical to the reionization of the universe and the metal enrichment of circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM). It is assumed that outflows in LAEs can help ionizing photons and Lyα photons escape out of galaxies. However we still know little about the outflows in high redshifts LAEs due to observational difficulties, especially at redshift > 5. Models of Lyα radiative transfer predict asymmetric Lyα line profiles with broad <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> in LAEs with outflows. Here we report a z 5. 7 Lyα emission line with a broad <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> extending to > 1000 km/s relative to the peak of Lyα line, which has been detected in only a couple of z > 5 LAEs till now. If the broad <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> is ascribed to gas outflow instead of AGN activity, the outflow velocity could be larger than the escape velocity (500 km/s) of typical halo mass of z 5. 7 LAEs, being consistent with the picture that outflows in LAEs disperse metals to CGM and IGM.

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the Avalanche and the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> was most intense from 1996 to 2002. During those seven seasons {{the two teams}} played five postseason series {{against each other in}} the Stanley Cup playoffs, with the Avalanche winning three of the series (1995–96, 4–2; 1998–99, 4–2; 1999–2000, 4–1) and the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> winning two of them (1996–97, 4–2; 2001–02, 4–3). During this time frame, these two teams {{combined}} for a total of five Stanley Cup championships in seven years, the Avalanche winning twice (1995–96 and 2000–01) and the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> winning three times (1996–97, 1997–98 and 2001–02). After 2002, the rivalry between the two teams began to cool down, and the two teams would not meet again in the playoffs until 2008, when the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> swept the Avalanche in the Western Conference Semi-finals and {{went on to win the}} Stanley Cup. The <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> moved to the Eastern Conference in 2013–14 season as part of the realignment which makes the two rivals only see each other twice a year.|$|E
5|$|As a free agent, Rome {{was unable}} to secure an NHL contract, and instead {{accepted}} an invitation to attend the Detroit <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> training camp on a try-out for the 2014–15 season. At {{the completion of the}} <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> pre-season, Rome was released and later signed to a professional try-out contract with the Norfolk Admirals of the AHL on October 22, 2014. After two games with the Admirals, Rome was released from his try-out contract.|$|E
5|$|By June 1992, the Nordiques {{announced}} that they were moving towards trading Lindros, and were engaged in trade discussions with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Calgary Flames, New Jersey Devils, Philadelphia Flyers, and Detroit <b>Red</b> <b>Wings.</b> The <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> were reported {{to be willing to}} trade Steve Yzerman, Steve Chiasson, and numerous draft picks to the Nordiques for Lindros. Yzerman indicated that he would also hold out from the Nordiques, should Detroit trade him to Quebec.|$|E

40|$|A {{transient}} event {{consistent with}} the predicted temporal and spectral signatures of an energetic proton beam was detected in the impulsive phase of a small flare on the red dwarf star AU Microscopii. It consisted of a prominent increase in the flux in the <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> of Lyman-alpha near 1223 A, simultaneously with the peak of a flare observed in the 1206 A transition region line of Si III. The probability that the <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> event was a chance fluctuation is one chance in 2. 5 x 10 exp 4. This observation represents a confirmation of the prediction by Orrall and Zirker (1976) in which downstreaming protons accelerated during the impulsive phase of a flare charge exchange with ambient neutral hydrogen and emit Lyman-alpha radiation from 1 to 15 A redward of line center...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the importance of}} the far <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> of the Lyman α line of hydrogen in the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs of pure hydrogen composition. We find that this absorption process dominates all important sources of opacity in the blue part of the optical spectrum of these stars. Our successful fits to the spectra of cool DA/DC white dwarfs indicate that the far <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> of the Ly α line is the source of opacity that had been missing in the models. The observed sequence of cool white dwarfs in color-color diagrams is very well reproduced by our new pure hydrogen atmosphere models, suggesting that the atmospheric composition of the coolest DC white dwarfs must be revisited.

5|$|Entering the 2002 playoffs as {{the eighth}} seed {{for the second}} {{consecutive}} year, the Canucks faced the Presidents' Trophy-winning Detroit <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> in the opening round. With 32- and 34-save performances from Cloutier, Vancouver won the first two games of the series. In game three, the Canucks and <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> were tied with a minute remaining in the second period when <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> defenceman Nicklas Lidström scored on Cloutier with a slapshot from centre ice. The goal was observed by the media as {{a turning point in the}} series for both Cloutier and the Canucks as a team. The <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> won game three, as well as the next three contests to eliminate the Canucks in six games; Cloutier was taken out of the game in the first period of the next two contests in favour of backup Peter Skudra.|$|E
5|$|Henderson {{attracted}} the attention of NHL scouts at the age of 15 when he scored 18 goals and 2 assists in a 21–6 victory in a juvenile playoff game. The junior affiliates of both the Boston Bruins and Detroit <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> offered him tryouts. He chose to sign with the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> as their junior teams were based in Hamilton, which was closest to his home. He played the 1959–60 season with the Junior B Goderich Sailors and was the youngest player on the team. Henderson moved up to the Junior A Hamilton <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> in 1960–61 where he was an extra forward for much of the season. Returning to Hamilton in 1961–62, he became a regular player on the team, and recorded 24 goals and 43 points in 50 games.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season, he was {{originally}} Detroit's backup goalie when Dominik Hašek {{came out of}} retirement, and Detroit management tried to trade Joseph, since the team also had a capable backup in Manny Legace. However, Joseph's $8 million USD per year contract made him hard to move. After {{a stint in the}} minors, he returned to the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> lineup while Hašek was nursing a groin injury. The <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> plan was to attract him to other teams until Hašek returned to the lineup. But in February, Hašek decided to call it quits for the season, which once again solidified Joseph's position as the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> starting goaltender. The Wings finished first overall in the league. After defeating the Nashville Predators in the first round in six games, the <b>Red</b> <b>Wings</b> were defeated {{in the second round of}} the playoffs in six games by the eventual Western Conference champions, the Calgary Flames.|$|E
40|$|The neotropical {{butterflies}} Heliconius melpomene and H. erato are Müllerian mimics {{that display}} the same warningly colored wing patterns in local populations, yet pattern diversity between geographic regions. Linkage mapping has previously shown convergent <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> phenotypes in these species {{are controlled by}} loci on homologous chromosomes. Here, AFLP bulk segregant analysis using H. melpomene crosses identified genetic markers tightly linked to two red wing-patterning loci. These markers were used to screen a H. melpomene BAC library and a tile path was assembled spanning one locus completely {{and part of the}} second. Concurrently, a similar strategy was used to identify a BAC clone tightly linked to the locus controlling the mimetic <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> phenotypes in H. erato. A methionine rich storage protein (MRSP) gene was identified within this BAC clone, and comparative genetic mapping shows <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> color loci are in homologous regions of the genome of H. erato and H. melpomene. Subtle differences in these convergent phenotypes imply they evolved independently using somewhat different developmental routes, but are nonetheless regulated by the same switch locus. Genetic mapping of MRSP in a third related species, the "tiger" patterned H. numata, has no association with wing patterning and shows no evidence for genomic translocation of wing-patterning loci.
