5000|$|As {{a result}} of a study {{conducted}} in 1947, the policy was implemented that authorized the <b>retroactive</b> <b>award</b> of the Bronze Star Medal (without the [...] "V" [...] device) to all soldiers who had received the Combat Infantryman Badge or the Combat Medical Badge during World War II. The basis for doing this was that the badges were awarded only to soldiers who had borne the hardships which resulted in General Marshall's support of the Bronze Star Medal.

5000|$|The National Defense Service Medal (NDSM) was {{established}} in 1953 by an executive order which Eisenhower signed.

When President Eisenhower left office in 1961, he returned to active duty as 5 star officers were entitled to serve on active duty for life. Thus, Eisenhower was entitled to two awards of the NDSM {{but there are no}} pictures of him wearing the medal and it is not known if he was ever formally awarded the medal.|$|R

50|$|Campaign or battle credit {{alone is}} not {{sufficient}} for award of the CIB. The specific eligibility criteria for the CIB require that an officer (SSI 11 or 18) in the grade of Colonel or below, or an Army enlisted Soldier or warrant officer with an infantry or Special Forces MOS, who subsequent to 6 December 1941 has satisfactorily performed duty while assigned or attached {{as a member of}} an infantry, ranger or special forces unit of brigade, regimental, or smaller size during any period such unit was engaged in active ground combat. Eligibility for Special Forces personnel in Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) 18B, 18C, 18E, 18F, and 18Z (less Special Forces medical sergeant) accrues from 20 December 1989. <b>Retroactive</b> <b>awards</b> of the CIB to Special Forces personnel are not authorized prior to 20 December 1989.

5000|$|Moreover, War Department Circular 269 stipulated: [...] "â€¦only one {{of these}} badges will be worn at one time" [...] and [...] "the Combat Infantryman badge is the highest award"; the {{awarding}} of the CIB was officially authorized with an executive order dated 15 November 1943; later, on 30 June 1944, the U.S. Congress approved an extra ten dollars in monthly pay to every infantryman awarded the CIBâ€”excepting commissioned officers. The WWII regulations did not formally prescribe a specific combat service period establishing the infantrymanâ€™s eligibility for being awarded a Combat Infantryman Badge, thus, in 1947, the U.S. Government implemented a policy authorizing the <b>retroactive</b> <b>awarding</b> of the Bronze Star Medal to World War II veteran soldiers who had been awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge, because the CIB was awarded only to soldiers who had borne combat duties befitting the recognition conferred by a Bronze Star Medal. Both awards required a commanderâ€™s recommendation and a citation in the pertinent orders. General Marshall initiated this after Medal of Honor-recipient Major Charles W. Davis noted to him that: [...] "It would be wonderful, if someone could design a badge for every infantryman who faces the enemy, every day and every night, with so little recognition".|$|R
5000|$|The Bavarian Military Merit Cross {{underwent}} {{three major}} revisions.

A Soldier must be personally present and under fire while serving in an assigned infantry or Special Forces primary duty, in a unit engaged in active ground combat, to close with and destroy the enemy with direct fires. Soldiers possessing MOS of 18D (Special Forces Medical Sergeant) who satisfactorily perform special forces duties while assigned or attached to a special forces unit of brigade, regimental, or smaller size during any period such unit was engaged in active ground combat may be awarded the CIB. These Soldiers must have been personally present and engaged in active ground combat, to close with and destroy the enemy with direct fires. <b>Retroactive</b> <b>awards</b> under these criteria are not authorized for service prior to 18 September 2001.
