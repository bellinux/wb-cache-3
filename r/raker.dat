5|$|Roosevelt's successor, Woodrow Wilson, {{signed the}} <b>Raker</b> Act into law on December 13, 1913, which {{authorized}} {{construction of the}} dam. Hetch Hetchy Reservoir grew as the valley was flooded behind the O'Shaughnessy Dam in 1923. The <b>Raker</b> Act also gave the city the right to store water in Lake Eleanor and Cherry Lake, both located northwest of Hetch Hetchy in the park.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, a dam in the {{northern}} portion of the park was proposed. Located in the Hetch Hetchy Valley, its purpose was to provide water and hydroelectric power to San Francisco. Muir and the Sierra Club opposed the project, while others, including Gifford Pinchot, supported it. In 1913, the U.S. Congress authorized the O'Shaughnessy Dam through passage of the <b>Raker</b> Act.|$|E
5|$|O'Shaughnessy Dam {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its original construction both for its environmental impact and {{violations of the}} <b>Raker</b> Act {{by the city of}} San Francisco. Although the <b>Raker</b> Act explicitly stated that power and water from the Hetch Hetchy Project could be used only for public purposes, San Francisco has sold Hetch Hetchy power to Pacific Gas & Electric (PG) since 1925. Dam removal advocates have stated that San Francisco's utilization of Yosemite National Park for water and power is unfair because of the damage to tourism and the local environment caused by the dam and reservoir. By draining the reservoir, removing the dam and restoring the valley to its original state, visitors to the park would once again be able to enjoy the natural beauty of Hetch Hetchy – once compared to that of Yosemite Valley. There are other rivers and reservoirs available for San Francisco to replace the water supply, such as the city's currently unused share of water in Lake Don Pedro, the biggest reservoir on the Tuolumne River.|$|E
30|$|P. micronesicus sp. nov. can be {{distinguished}} from its sibling species, P. coelestis, in typically having 15 rays on the anal fin (vs. 14 rays in P. coelestis, Figure  2 C), 15 or 16 <b>rakers</b> on the lower limb of the first gill arch (vs. 13 or 14 <b>rakers),</b> more total gill <b>rakers</b> on the first gill arch (20 to 23 vs. 18 to 21), and a lower body depth (Table  1). Moreover, the caudal fin usually possesses a filamentous upper lobe that is deeply concave in P. micronesicus sp. nov., {{but that was not}} frequently observed in P. coelestis. On the other hand, P. auriventris has II, 14 anal fin rays, 13 gill <b>rakers</b> on the lower limb, and 18 or 19 total gill <b>rakers</b> on the first gill arch. P. alleni has II, 14 anal fin rays, 12 or 13 gill <b>rakers</b> in the upper limb, and 17 or 18 total gill <b>rakers</b> in the first gill arch (Table  2).|$|R
50|$|Atlantic {{menhaden}} are filter feeders, {{meaning that}} they collect food by filtering water through modifications of the branchial apparatus (gill arches and gill <b>rakers).</b> Atlantic menhaden’s diet depends {{on the size of}} their gill <b>rakers,</b> which change as menhaden age. When the <b>rakers</b> are smaller, which generally correspond to when they are under the age of 1, Atlantic menhaden feed primarily on phytoplankton. As they age and their gill <b>rakers</b> grow larger, menhaden shift their diet to primarily consume zooplankton.|$|R
5000|$|The Strob inserts or <b>rakers,</b> have {{cutting edges}} which extend outside the two plane {{surfaces}} of the blade, but fractionally less than the kerf. These <b>rakers</b> have some important advantages, primarily {{the ease with which}} they saw through green or uncured wood which would otherwise jam the saw blade. Strob <b>rakers</b> are made from hard metals such as tungsten carbide, cobalt-steel alloy, or Stellite.|$|R

25|$|Sales {{of various}} types of horse pulled {{harvesting}} machines increased dramatically between the Civil war {{and the end of}} the century. Harvesting machine improvements included automatic rakers, which eliminated the manual <b>raker,</b> allowing operation by a single man, and combination harvester and binders.|$|E
50|$|Gulf {{menhaden}} are filter feeders, {{meaning that}} they collect food by filtering water through modifications of the branchial apparatus (gill or branchial arches and gill <b>rakers).</b> Like Atlantic menhaden, Gulf menhaden’s diet depends {{on the size of}} their gill <b>rakers,</b> which change as menhaden age. Larval gulf menhaden feed primary on zooplankton because the <b>rakers</b> are not well developed. The juveniles, which generally correspond to when they are under the age of 1, Gulf menhaden feed more on phytoplankton. As they age and their gill <b>rakers</b> fully developed, menhaden shift their diet to primarily consume phytoplankton.|$|R

He was invited to spring training by the San Diego Padres in February , but did not make the team and was optioned to the Padres Triple-A affiliate, the Portland Beavers. <b>Rakers</b> appeared in only one major league game and became a minor league free agent {{at the end of the}} season. <b>Rakers</b> signed with the Houston Astros for the [...] season, but was released shortly after and signed with the York Revolution of the Atlantic League for the 2008 season.|$|R
25|$|During ice ages, glaciers have {{modified}} {{and helped}} to erode the older volcanoes in the park. The center of snow accumulation and therefore ice radiation was Lassen Peak, Red Mountain, and <b>Raker</b> Peak. These volcanoes thus show more glacial scarring than other volcanoes in the park.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} shield volcanoes in the park; Mount Harkness (southwest {{corner of the}} park), Red Mountain (at south-central boundary), Prospect Peak (in {{northeast}} corner), and <b>Raker</b> Peak (north of Lassen Peak). All of these volcanoes are 7,000–8,400 feet (2,133–2,560 m) above sea level and each is topped by a cinder cone volcano.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, {{the city}} of San Francisco {{proposed}} building a hydroelectric dam to flood Hetch Hetchy Valley. The city and the Sierra Club argued over the dam for 10 years, until the U.S. Congress passed the <b>Raker</b> Act in 1913 and allowed dam building to proceed. O'Shaughnessy Dam was completed in 1923.|$|E
50|$|To {{prevent the}} {{potentially}} damaging passage of solid material through the gill slits {{and over the}} gill filaments, early gill <b>rakers</b> strained large particles from the water and diverted them to the esophagus. Since an appreciable fraction of this material was nutritious, <b>rakers</b> subsequently evolved as food-trapping mechanisms in filter feeders. Gill <b>rakers,</b> when long and closely set, play the same role in suspension-feeding fish such as mullet, herring, megamouth, basking and whale sharks, as baleen in the filter-feeding whales.|$|R
25|$|These {{fish have}} muscular bodies, ossified bones, scales, well {{developed}} gills and central nervous systems, and large hearts and kidneys. Mesopelagic plankton feeders have small mouths with fine gill <b>rakers,</b> while the piscivores have larger mouths and coarser gill <b>rakers.</b> The vertically migratory fish have swimbladders.|$|R

25|$|Ickes' {{support of}} PWA power plants put {{increased}} financial pressure on private power companies during the Great Depression, which had {{both positive and}} negative effects. He tried to enforce the <b>Raker</b> Act against the city of San Francisco, an act of Congress that specified that because the dam at Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park was on public land, no private profit could be derived from the development. The city continues selling the power to PG, which is then resold at a profit.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the valley}} was within Yosemite National Park, {{an act of}} Congress was needed to authorize the project. The U.S. Congress passed and President Woodrow Wilson signed the <b>Raker</b> Act in 1913, which {{permitted}} the flooding of the valley under the conditions that power and water derived from the river could only be utilized for public interests. Ultimately, the city would fail to keep its promise, selling hydropower from the dam to Pacific Gas and Electric (PG), which would lead to decades of legal wrangling and controversy.|$|E

25|$|Carangoides is a genus of {{tropical}} to subtropical marine fishes in the jack family, Carangidae. They are small- to large-sized, deep-bodied fish characterised {{by a certain}} gill <b>raker</b> and jaw morphology, often appearing very similar to jacks in the genus Caranx. They inhabit the subtropical and tropical regions of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans, often occupying coastal areas, including reefs, bays, and estuaries, rarely venturing far offshore. They are all predatory fishes, taking a variety of smaller fishes, crustaceans and cephalopods as prey. The genus was first erected in 1851 by Pieter Bleeker for an unknown taxon and currently contains 21 species. Many make up significant proportions of various fisheries, although a number of ciguatera cases {{have been attributed to}} them.|$|E
25|$|Following this, a <b>raker</b> {{was arrested}} and the salt pans were seized and divided by force. The Bahamas {{government}} attempted to appoint judicial authorities for the Turks in 1768, but these were refused by the Bermudians. In 1773 the Bahamian government passed an act attempting to tax the salt produced in the Turks, but the Bermudians refused to pay it. In 1774, the Bahamians passed another, similar act, and this they submitted for the Crown's assent. The Crown passed this act on to the Bermudian government which objected to it, and which rejected Bahamian jurisdiction over the Turks. The Crown, as a consequence, refused assent of the Act as applied to include the Turks, and, in the form in which it finally passed, the Bahamas, but not the Turks, were included.|$|E

40|$|Suspension-feeding fish filter minute prey (approximately 5 – 3000 m m) {{from large}} volumes of water that enter through the mouth and exit via the opercula (Gerking, 1994; Sanderson and Wassersug, 1993). Some members of the most species-rich {{freshwater}} fish family, the Cyprinidae, {{have been reported to}} suspension-feed by using a branchial sieve composed of gill arches with interdigitating rows of gill <b>rakers</b> to strain food particles from the water (Hoogenboezem et al., 1993; Van den Berg et al., 1994). In the reducible-channel model of sieving, food particles are trapped in the channels between the medial gill <b>rakers,</b> and the mesh size of the sieve can be reduced when the lateral gill <b>rakers</b> are lowered under muscular control into the channels (Hoogenboezem et al., 1991).

25|$|The {{bar jack}} has a gray to grayish blue upper {{body with a}} silvery tint, which fades ventrally to a white belly. As {{indicated}} by their common name, adult bar jack have a horizontal stripe running along their back and through the lower lobe of the caudal fin. This bar is a golden brownish to blackish color, often with an electric blue bar running parallel immediately underneath it. All other fins are pale dusky to hyaline. Juveniles have up to 6 dark bands on their body and a darker lower caudal lobe than the upper lobe, foreshadowing the bar that develops at a later stage. At these early stages, they are difficult to distinguish from Carangoides bartholomaei, with the best identifier being gill <b>raker</b> counts. The entire body has been observed to change colour to a blackish colour when the fish is feeding near the bottom.|$|E
25|$|The blue runner, Caranx crysos (also {{known as}} the bluestripe jack, Egyptian scad, hardtail jack and hardnose), is a common species of {{moderately}} large marine fish classified in the jack family, Carangidae. The blue runner is distributed across the Atlantic Ocean, ranging from Brazil to Canada in the western Atlantic and from Angola to Great Britain including the Mediterranean in the east Atlantic. The blue runner is distinguished from similar species by several morphological features, including {{the extent of the}} upper jaw, gill <b>raker</b> count and lateral line scale counts. The blue runner is known to reach a maximum length of 70cm and 5.05kg in weight, but is much more common below 35cm. The species inhabits both inshore and offshore environments, predominantly over reefs, however it is known to congregate around large man made offshore structures such as oil platforms. Juveniles tend to inhabit shallower reef and lagoon waters, before moving to deeper waters as adults.|$|E
25|$|The yellowspotted trevally, yellowspotted kingfish, goldspotted trevally, or tarrum, Carangoides fulvoguttatus, is a {{widespread}} species of large inshore marine fish in the jack family Carangidae. The yellowspotted trevally inhabits the tropical and subtropical waters of the western Indo-Pacific region, from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and Australia in the east. The species is known to grow to a maximum length of at least 1.2 m, and is distinguished by gill <b>raker</b> and fin morphology, as well as the distinctive golden spots which give the fish its name. The yellowspotted trevally generally prefers inshore rocky and coral reefs, but is occasionally found over deep offshore sand banks to a depth of 100 m. It is a predatory fish, taking fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans, and shows diet partitioning with other trevallies in studies conducted in Australian waters. Reproduction is poorly studied, although observational evidence suggests spawning occurs in aggregations, probably during summer in South Africa. It is generally of minor importance to commercial fisheries throughout its range, but is considered an excellent sportfish by anglers and spearfishermen, and a good table fish.|$|E
50|$|Gill <b>rakers</b> in {{fish are}} bony or {{cartilaginous}} processes that project from the branchial arch (gill arch) and {{are involved with}} suspension feeding tiny prey. They {{are not to be}} confused with the gill filaments that compose the fleshy part of the gill used for gas exchange. <b>Rakers</b> are usually present in two rows, projecting from both the anterior and posterior side of each gill arch. <b>Rakers</b> are widely varied in number, spacing, and form. By preventing food particles from exiting the spaces between the gill arches, they enable the retention of food particles in filter feeders.|$|R
