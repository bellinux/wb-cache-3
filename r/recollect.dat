5|$|A {{detached}} four-storey {{bell tower}} was built near the riverbanks {{by the first}} Augustinian <b>Recollect</b> priest of Loboc. It has seven bells, with the 1863 bell being the oldest and the 1937 bell, named for Father Cayetano Bastes, being the largest. It also has a large wooden ratchet, installed in 1899, used during Holy Week, and a clock made by the Altonaga Company, installed in 1893.|$|E
5|$|According to Jesús Pastor Paloma, an Agustinian <b>Recollect</b> priest, the {{structure}} was also {{supposed to have}} a prefabricated retablo (reredos) altar, which was lost at sea when the ship carrying it from Belgium capsized in a storm; a wooden altar was made locally in its stead. Paloma also noted that the bottom part of the church was designed to resemble a ship's hull, so that it would sway during an earthquake.|$|E
50|$|Field vs. Observer: Autobiographical {{memories}} can {{be experienced}} from different perspectives. Field memories are memories <b>recollected</b> {{in the original}} perspective, from a first-person point of view. Observer memories are memories <b>recollected</b> from a perspective outside ourselves, a third-person point of view. Typically, older memories are <b>recollected</b> through an observer perspective, and observer memories are more often reconstructions while field memories are more vivid like copies.|$|R

5|$|In 1635, <b>Recollect</b> missionaries {{arrived in}} Romblon to {{establish}} Catholic missions and settlements. They helped the Spanish authorities establish peace {{and order in}} the islands. In 1878, they established seven missionary centers at Romblon, Badajoz (San Agustin), Cajidiocan, Banton, Looc, Odiongan and Magallanes (Magdiwang). They also built massive forts, churches and watchtowers in the province, such as Fort San Jose in Banton and Fort San Andres in Romblon, following a Dutch attack in 1646 which destroyed the capital town and to repulse recurring Moro raids.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, San Sebastian Church has {{encountered}} threats to its structural integrity. The steel structure has been beset by rust and corrosion due to sea breezes from nearby Manila Bay. State funding was accorded {{to the church}} through the National Historical Institute which undertook restoration in 1982. The <b>Recollect</b> community has likewise expended funds for the church's maintenance and restoration. In 1998, it {{was placed on the}} biennial watchlist of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the World Monuments Fund, though it was not retained in the subsequent watchlists.|$|E
5|$|Following Rai's {{death in}} 1940, Devika Rani {{took control of}} the studio and {{produced}} some more films in partnership with her late husband's associates, namely Sashadhar Mukherjee and Ashok Kumar. As she was to <b>recollect</b> in her old age, the films which she supervised tended to flop, while the films supervised by the partners tended to be hits. In 1945, she retired from films, married the Russian painter Svetoslav Roerich and moved to his estate on the outskirts of Bangalore, thereafter leading a very reclusive life for the next five decades. Her persona, no less than her film roles, were considered socially unconventional. Her awards include the Padmashri (1958), Dadasaheb Phalke Award (1970) and the Soviet Land Nehru Award (1990).|$|E
5000|$|The Order of Augustinian <b>Recollects</b> (O.A.R.) {{or simply}} the Augustinian <b>Recollects</b> are a Roman Catholic mendicant Catholic {{religious}} order of friars and nuns.

50|$|As {{reviewed}} by Rugg and Curran, the precise functional {{significance of the}} LPC continues to be debated. One early suggestion was that the effect reflects processes {{that contribute to the}} representation of <b>recollected</b> information. Alternatively, the effect might index attentional orienting to <b>recollected</b> information, rather than processes supporting its representation or maintenance. It has recently been argued that findings indicating that the effect varies according to the amount of information <b>recollected</b> are more consistent with the first of these two proposals.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Recollects</b> {{are present}} in 19 {{countries}} including:In 1997, the <b>Recollects</b> numbered 1,258 in 201 religious houses, distributed into eight provinces (regions) in four continents, but strongest in Spain, the Philippines and Colombia.

5|$|With Ultimecia defeated, the {{universe}} begins returning to normal; however, Squall is nearly {{lost in the}} flow of time as he witnesses the origins of the game's story, ghostly, sporadic apparitions of Rinoa, and a faceless portrait of himself. When a dying Ultimecia travels back in time to pass her powers to Edea, Squall informs Edea of the concepts of Garden and SeeD that she will create. Afterward, he is able to properly <b>recollect</b> his memories and thus return to the present with Rinoa's help. Seifer, no longer a Garden member, is once again reunited with Raijin and Fujin; Laguna visits Raine's grave (and remembers his proposal to her) along with Ellone, Ward, and Kiros; and a celebration takes place in the Garden, with Squall and Rinoa sharing a kiss under the moonlight.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} side of the altar are two retablos. The larger altar on {{the right side}} {{currently}} houses the image of St. Francis Xavier as preacher on the topmost level. On the middle level of the same retablo are images of Saint Vincent Ferrer in the center, and Saint Augustine and Saint Monica on the left and right niches, respectively. The lowest level contains images of the Nuestra Señora de la Consolacion in the center, Saint Anne to the right and Saint Thérèse of Lisieux (originally St Joachim) on the left. The smaller altar has two levels of baroque and neoclassical style, respectively, with images of the crucified Christ on the lower level and the Holy Infant on the upper. The tomb of Father Aquilino Bon and other <b>Recollect</b> priests who served Loboc are also on this side of the church. The remains of Jesuit priest Alonso de Humanes were formerly interred in this area before the transfer of his remains to San Ignacio in Intramuros. An apocryphal account tells of a fire in a former Loboc church stopping at the foot of Humanes' tomb; this story spread across the people of the Loboc and nearby towns, which drew pilgrims to light candles in memory of Humanes.|$|E
5|$|Seetharamudu was a {{barrister}} {{who returned}} from London upon his father's death to manage his family businesses. He was a zamindar and {{was fond of}} cars. In one such instance, he sees a poor farmer called Ramalakshmi and decides to marry her. Asked by a mediator, she accepts the proposal, without meeting Seetharamudu, but asks him for six months' delay as she has to buy new clothes for the bridegroom, following the village's tradition. Seetharamudu learns about this and meets her as a reformed thief. With his help, Ramalakshmi could cultivate enough grain in three months and buy new clothes with that money. On the day of marriage, she is surprised to know that Seetharamudu is her chosen groom and they marry. On 14 February 1924 the couple goes out, but Chaitanya, suffering from fever then, fakes a stomach ache so that his parents return. The plan works and the couple rush home at high speed but die in an accident at 10:20 AM near the same clock tower where Radha Mohan and Krishna Veni would die. Now he aims to reunite them without letting them <b>recollect</b> their past as they cannot bear the pain of losing him.|$|E

25|$|If such an {{assessment}} is correct, {{it suggests that}} the use of text to <b>recollect</b> memories was, for medieval practitioners, merely a variant of techniques employing notae, images and other non-textual devices.
