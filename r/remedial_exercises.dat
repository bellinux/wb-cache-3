50|$|The {{program was}} founded by Barbara Arrowsmith Young while she was a {{graduate}} student at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education. As a child she had exceptional visual and auditory memory, but it was coupled with several severe deficits in other areas, including dyslexia, dyscalculia, and problems with spatial reasoning, logic, and kinesthetic perception. In 1977-1978 she developed a series of <b>remedial</b> <b>exercises</b> which she says helped her to overcome her own disabilities rather than merely compensate for them. According to Arrowsmith Young, she based the program on Mark Rosenzweig's work on neuroplasticity and on the work of Alexander Luria and his theories about the relationship between the neurodynamic processes in different functional systems of the brain.|$|E

This randomized controlled trial compared comprehensive massage therapy (soft-tissue manipulation, <b>remedial</b> <b>exercise</b> and posture education), 2 components of massage therapy and placebo {{in the treatment of}} subacute (between 1 week and 8 months) low-back pain. METHODS: Subjects with subacute low-back pain were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: comprehensive massage therapy (n = 25), soft-tissue manipulation only (n = 25), <b>remedial</b> <b>exercise</b> with posture education only (n = 22) or a placebo of sham laser therapy (n = 26). Each subject received 6 treatments within approximately 1 month. Outcome measures obtained at baseline, after treatment and at 1 -month follow-up consisted of the Roland Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), the McGill Pain Questionnaire (PPI and PRI), the State Anxiety Index and the Modified Schober test (lumbar range of motion). RESULTS: Of the 107 subjects who passed screening, 98 (92 %) completed post-treatment tests and 91 (85 %) completed follow-up tests. Statistically significant differences were noted after treatment and at follow-up. The comprehensive massage therapy group had improved function (mean RDQ score 1. 54 v. 2. 86 - 6. 5, p < 0. 001), less intense pain (mean PPI score 0. 42 v. 1. 18 - 1. 75, p < 0. 001) and a decrease in the quality of pain (mean PRI score 2. 29 v. 4. 55 - 7. 71, p = 0. 006) compared with the other 3 groups. Clinical significance was evident for the comprehensive massage therapy group and the soft-tissue manipulation group on the measure of function. At 1 -month follow-up 63 % of subjects in the comprehensive massage therapy group reported no pain as compared with 27 % of the soft-tissue manipulation group, 14 % of the <b>remedial</b> <b>exercise</b> group and 0 % of the sham laser therapy group.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a study {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the alignment of an ESP subject with its corresponding content subjects. The ESP subject, which provides profession/discipline-related language education to undergraduate students studying biomedical engineering in the Department of Health Technology and Informatics (HTI) of a university in Hong Kong, is closely aligned with several HTI subjects in assessments, teaching foci, teaching schedules, and other aspects of the curriculum. The writing performances in laboratory reports and final year project proposals of two student cohorts, one of which took the ESP subject, were assessed by two external biomedical engineering professionals and one language specialist. Students’ perceptions and teachers’ reflections on the subject alignment were explored through surveys and interviews. The findings, which were analysed statistically and qualitatively, show how deeper collaboration between language education providers, academic departments and workplace professionals can facilitate the design and implementation of effective ESP courses. It was found that appropriate alignment of the delivery time of the ESP subject and its corresponding HTI subjects led to more effective learning and teaching while mismatch in assessment foci and arrangements affected learners’ satisfaction with the subject alignment. Students also worried about a perceived role imbalance between the two academic units; this finding echoes to a certain extent Hyland’s (2002) contention that ESP, if seen as a service activity, may be “marginalized as a <b>remedial</b> <b>exercise</b> designed to fix up students’ problem”.

In an effort to fill needs in each of these areas, this article describes an innovative feedback strategy intended to improve students ’ structural knowledge. Twenty-four high school physics students were assessed using Pathfinder networks (PFnets) for their structural knowledge of a just-completed unit on work, energy, and power. As feedback, students were shown both their PFnet and a referent PFnet and were asked to reflect on the differences. In addition, misconceptions regarding the concept of work were identified in their PFnets and used to present individualized <b>remedial</b> <b>exercises</b> to each student. Following this feedback/remediation session, students ’ structural knowledge was again assessed. Results indicate that overall structural knowledge improved following feedback/remediation.

40|$|Peter Westen 2 ̆ 7 s The Logic of Consent {{is nothing}} short of a tour de force. In the {{tradition}} of the very best and most significant contributions to legal theory, Professor Westen demonstrates that {{we do not know what}} we think we know about a capacity that on a daily basis turns trespasses into dinner parties, brutal batteries into football games, rape into lovemaking, and the commercial appropriation of name and likeness into biography. While we all employ claims of consent in everyday moral gossip to absolve some and withhold sympathy from others, and while courts of law across the nation commonly predicate legal rights and responsibilities on findings of consent or its absence, Professor Westen convincingly proves that (1) we do not share, either individually or institutionally, a common concept of consent; (2) a number of the competing conceptions of consent that are regularly employed (sometimes simultaneously by the same person or court) are either, in themselves, conceptually incoherent, or are frequently combined in ways that produce conceptual confusion; and (3) our failure to sort out our conceptual confusions results in gross injustices and inequities as we punish the innocent and acquit the guilty. Frankly speaking, when one agrees to review a book one privately hopes for two things: that the book will not offer so many points of disagreement as to make one 2 ̆ 7 s review feel like a <b>remedial</b> <b>exercise</b> (giving rise to the 2 ̆ 2 so many confusions, so little time 2 ̆ 2 response); and that it will offer enough points of disagreement to provide one with grounds for serious debate with the author.

40|$|The {{present study}} is an attempt at a {{detailed}} diagnosis of the accumulated inefficiency in the Indian power sector, the consequent reform drives, and the political economy involved in these aspects. The discussion in the wider canvas of the national scenario is substantiated {{by focusing on the}} Kerala power sector, taken for illustrative purpose. It is shown that much of the capacity/energy deficit we experience today could be easily avoided with some achievable functional improvement in the power sector. We also estimate, on some very plausible assumptions, the avoidable cost of inefficiency at a few amenable functional levels and find it to represent about one-third of the reported cost of electricity supply in India in 1997 - 98 ! Given such scope for cost reduction, the attempts at tariff hikes amount to transferring the inefficiency onto the customers. Based on these observations, we argue that the present system predicament is due to problems that are just internal to the system. This then implies that there do remain sufficient quarters for <b>remedial</b> <b>exercises,</b> meant to remove the problems that {{stand in the way of}} the SEBs' improved performance. In other words, what the system badly requires is essence-specific reforms, not structure-specific ones.

40|$|Lymphedema is a {{debilitating}} and disfiguring sequela of an overwhelmed lymphatic system. The most common causes of secondary lymphedema are lymphatic filariasis (LF), a vector-borne, parasitic disease endemic in 73 tropical countries, and treatment for cancer in developed countries. Lymphedema is incurable and requires life-long care so identification of effective lymphedema management {{is imperative to}} improve quality of life, reduce the burden on family resources and benefit the local community. This review was conducted to evaluate the evidence for effective lymphedema self-care strategies that might be applicable to management {{of all types of}} secondary lymphedema. Searches were conducted in Medline, CINAHL and Scopus databases in March 2015. Included studies reported before and after measures of lymphedema status or frequency of acute infections. The methodological quality was assessed using the appropriate Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist. Descriptive synthesis and meta-analysis were used to evaluate effectiveness of the outcomes reported. Twenty-eight papers were included; two RCTs were found to have strong methodology, and overall 57 % of studies were rated as methodologically weak. Evidence from filariasis-related lymphedema (FR-LE) studies indicated that hygiene-centred self-care reduced the frequency and duration of acute episodes by 54 %, and in cancer-related lymphedema (CR-LE) home-based exercise including deep breathing delivered significant volume reductions over standard self-care alone. Intensity of training in self-care practices and frequency of monitoring improved outcomes. Cultural and economic factors and access to health care services influenced the type of intervention delivered and how outcomes were measured. There is evidence to support the adoption of <b>remedial</b> <b>exercises</b> in the management of FR-LE and for a greater emphasis on self-treatment practices for people with CR-LE.

5000|$|Modern {{physical}} therapy was established {{towards the end}} of the 19th century due to events that had an effect on a global scale, which called for rapid advances in {{physical therapy}}. Soon following American orthopedic surgeons began treating children with disabilities and began employing women trained in physical education, and <b>remedial</b> <b>exercise.</b> These treatments were applied and promoted further during the Polio outbreak of 1916. During the First World War women were recruited to work with and restore physical function to injured soldiers, and the field of physical therapy was institutionalized. In 1918 the term [...] "Reconstruction Aide" [...] was used to refer to individuals practicing physical therapy. The first school of physical therapy was established at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C., following the outbreak of World War I. Research catalyzed the physical therapy movement. The first physical therapy research was published in the United States in March 1921 in [...] "The PT Review." [...] In the same year, Mary McMillan organized the American Women's Physical Therapeutic Association (now called the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA). In 1924, the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation promoted the field by touting physical therapy as a treatment for polio.Treatment through the 1940s primarily consisted of exercise, massage, and traction. Manipulative procedures to the spine and extremity joints began to be practiced, especially in the British Commonwealth countries, in the early 1950s. Around this time when polio vaccines were developed, physical therapists have become a normal occurrence in hospitals throughout North America and Europe. In the late 1950s, physical therapists started to move beyond hospital-based practice to outpatient orthopedic clinics, public schools, colleges/universities health-centres, geriatric settings (skilled nursing facilities), rehabilitation centers and medical centers. Specialization for physical therapy in the U.S. occurred in 1974, with the Orthopaedic Section of the APTA being formed for those physical therapists specializing in orthopaedics. In the same year, the International Federation of Orthopaedic Manipulative Physical Therapists was formed, which has ever since played an important role in advancing manual therapy worldwide.|$|R
40|$|In this Article, I {{argue that}} the {{deportation}} of lawful permanent residents on account of a criminal conviction is punitive, and therefore enhanced constitutional protections must be afforded to lawful permanent residents during removal proceedings. To support this argument I rely, in part, on the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Padilla v. Kentucky. The Padilla Court held that counsel must inform a client when a plea carries the risk of deportation. The Court’s analysis throughout the decision is groundbreaking in its recognition of the modern day realities of deportation - specifically the growing relationship between the immigration and criminal justice systems {{and the ways in}} which criminal convictions and deportation have become enmeshed over the years. The Court’s language provides support for the argument that deportation may not be a <b>remedial</b> <b>exercise</b> by the government to enforce immigration laws - as the Court has held for over a century - but may in fact constitute punishment. If deportation is recognized as punishment, then additional constitutional protections, like the right to counsel, must be afforded to lawful permanent residents who are in removal proceedings on account of criminal convictions. This Article is novel in two respects. First, it offers a fresh look at the punitive nature of deportation, using the Padilla decision, and other case law, to bolster this argument. Second, this Article suggests that the analytical approach used by the Supreme Court in its juvenile delinquency jurisprudence, which extended greater constitutional protections to juveniles during the adjudicative stage of delinquency proceedings, could provide the framework for determining which protections should be afforded to lawful permanent residents who are in removal proceedings on account of a criminal conviction. Like deportation, juvenile delinquency proceedings have been labeled civil, but the Court has recognized that because a finding of delinquency could result in incarceration, the Due Process Clause requires additional protections during these proceedings. Similarly, lawful permanent residents face the risk of being removed from their country of permanent residence - this results in separation from family and removal from a person’s home. As such, due process requires the need for additional protections...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : The {{physical}} activity preferences (PAP) and attitude towards health's promotion among freshers from different classes {{while maintaining a}} constant level of {{physical activity}} (PA) intervention. OBJECTIVE : To determine changes in the PAP of future physical education teachers and health educators. METHODS : The {{studies were carried out}} in 2000 and 2008 year with students from Lithuanian Academy of Physical Education (LAPE). A standardized, self administered questionnaire was filled in by 577 fresher students (244 males and 333 females). RESULTS : There were fewer students who wanted to attend a special health training course (coping with stress, <b>remedial</b> <b>exercise,</b> healthy nutrition) in 2008 than in 2000 (males 57. 8 % and 46. 7 %, p CONCLUSIONS : The data suggest that there is an increasing need for intervention to promote PA among students who enter the academy and continue studying here. RECOMMENDATIONS : It is necessary to develop physical activity programs for an integral academy education, mainly in females, avoiding the lowering of physical activity as they move higher at the educational level. Also the plan {{to increase the number of}} physical activities and exercises must be included in curricular scenarios, and the use of leisure time must be oriented towards physical activity. [VÝCHODISKA : Preference pohybových aktivit (PPA) a podpora zdravého životního stylu mezi studenty 1. ročníků různých oborů při současném udržování konstantní úrovně intervence v pohybové aktivitě (PA). CÍLE : Určit změny v PPA u budoucích učitelů TV a zdravotních poradců. METODIKA : Studie byly prováděny v letech 2000 a 2008 u studentů Litevské akademie tělesné výchovy (LAPE). Standardizovaný, samostatně vyplňovaný dotazník odevzdalo 577 studentů 1. ročníků (244 mužů a 333 žen). VÝSLEDKY : V roce 2008 bylo méně studentů, kteří chtěli navštěvovat speciální kurzy zdravotně orientovaného tréninku (zvládání stresu, rehabilitační cvičení, zdravá výživa), než tomu bylo v roce 2000 (muži 57, 8 %, resp. 46, 7 %, p < 0, 1; ženy 84, 4 %, resp. 71, 2 % p < 0, 02). Ženy prokázaly kritičtější pohled na prostředí akademie než muži a uvedly, že v roce 2008 je na akademii méně možností zdravého stravování než v roce 2000 (26, 1 % oproti 19, 12 % p < 0, 02). Po osmi letech studenti akademie využívají nástroje podpory zdravého životního stylu méně často. Počet studentů využívajících v roce 2008 energické a posilující činnosti se oproti roku 2000 snížil (muži 59, 2 %, resp. 46, 7 %; ženy 47, 7 %, resp. 22, 5 % p < 0, 001). Menší počet si také vybíral wellness centra (muži 27, 6 %, resp. 22, 8 %; ženy 37, 0 %, resp. 11, 6 % p < 0, 001). V roce 2008 bylo méně žen, jež uvedly, že se účastní aktivit, při nichž se potí a rychleji dýchají (2 – 3 × za týden a více), než tomu bylo v roce 2000 (χ 2 = 49, 05, p < 0, 001). Koeficient kontingence (C) měřící sílu tohoto spojení byl 0, 369. ZÁVĚRY: Výsledky naznačují, že vzrůstá potřeba intervence vedoucí k podpoře PA mezi studenty, kteří přicházejí na akademii a pokračují zde ve studiu. DOPORUČENÍ : Zejména u žen je nezbytné připravit programy pohybových aktivit pro integrovanou výuku na akademii, čímž by se omezilo snižování objemu pohybových aktivit úměrné tomu, jak studenti postupují do dalších ročníků. Plán na zvýšení objemu pohybových aktivit a cvičení musí být zahrnut také do studijního plánu a využití volného času se musí orientovat na pohybové aktivity. ...|$|R
