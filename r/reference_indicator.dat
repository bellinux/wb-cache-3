Price seasonality is decreasing in cost seasonality. An increase in demand for more-processed products induces a shift toward non-seasonal production. Regions with strongly seasonal cost advantages will produce lower-value products while less-seasonal regions will produce higher-value products. If a region with high-cost seasonality has a non-seasonal cost disadvantage, then an increase in demand for processing can reduce the region 2 ̆ 7 s competitiveness...|$|E

Visible to shortwave infrared imaging spectrometers {{can be used to}} detect and monitor several biochemical variations in the leaf offering a faster, cheaper and non-destructive alternative to the traditional methods. In this study, hyperspectral images were used to obtain the spectralsignatures of grapevine leaves (Vitis Vinifera L. cv. Shiraz) under different water conditions. Hyperspectral images were collected using a line scan sensor with a resolution of 813 x 456 pixels in the visible and nearinfrared region, from 450 to 980 nm.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the use of non {{destructive}} testing methods (NDT) to assess indicators of concrete durability and mechanical properties of reinforced concrete structures. On site, NDT methods based on electromagnetic or ultrasonic wave propagation (such as radar, impact echo, ultrasonic transmission deviceÉ) are used because they are more or less sensitive to water content and mechanical properties depending on the method. It has been shown, in a former project [1, 2], that the NDT results called Òobservablesî are linked to mechanical and durability indicators (YoungÕs modulus, compressive strength, porosity and saturation degree). Meanwhile, the relationship between observables and indicators depends on the concrete mix design. A calibration protocol is then proposed to get this relationship for the right mix of the reinforced structure studied by using a minimal number of cores. The cores are non-destructively characterised in laboratory or used to determined <b>reference</b> <b>indicators</b> by standardised destructive methods.

MethodsTotally 235 patients with liver cirrhosis were selected from the Second People′s Hospital of Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, China, from March 2012 to March 2014, with 100 healthy individuals as controls. Color Doppler ultrasonography was performed to measure the portal vein diameter (PVD), mean portal vein velocity (PVVmean), and blood flow quantity of portal vein (PVQ). Portal vein pressure (Ppv) was calculated from the equation of Ppv= 1. 895 1 + 0  001 1 PVQ. FibroScan was also performed. Continuous data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Group comparisons were performed by t test. The relationship between test parameters and Ppv was examined by correlation analysis.

Glucose was the best carbon source for the production of mycelial biomass and ABEP. The medium composition significantly affected both the relative content of β-(1 - 3) -glucan and the molecular mass (Mr) in the ABEP and, as a consequence, it also affected the biological activity of ABEP. A medium containing 3. 0 g/L of KH 2 PO 4 gave an ABEP of the highest biological activity (1440 pg of TNF-α/mL/ 5 x 10 ^ 4 cells), while a medium containing 10 mg/L of vitamin B 1 gave an ABEP with a biological activity of 1080 pg of TNF-α/mL/ 5 x 10 ^ 4 cells.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the European {{experience}} with a basket currency, the ECU. The ECU was initially introduced as a reference unit and later became the anchor of the European Monetary System. Public policy was complemented by private sector initiatives {{and use of the}} ECU for denomination of financial instruments. In practice, it turned out that a basket currency entails considerable unexpected technical complexities. The technical particularities of a basket currency are discussed before we turn to the criteria for determining the shares of participating currencies. We show that there are no iron-clad economic principles and therefore there is some room for political considerations. In Europe three criteria were used for determining the weights: GDP shares, international trade shares, and financial market indicators. In addition, weights will change with exchange rate movements. Appreciating currencies will experience increasing weights and depreciating currencies decreasing weights. This may require a correction mechanism for political acceptability. In Europe, weights were rescaled by political authorities every five years. From an economic viewpoint, weights depend critically on the purpose of the basket currency: is it a <b>reference</b> <b>indicator,</b> is it a currency for international transactions, or is it a parallel currency? Thus, before weights are to be discussed a clear vision {{of the role of the}} basket currency would be desirable. The vastly different growth performance among Asian economies also suggests a preference to forward rather than backward-looking measures. Turning then to the different functions of a basket currency, we examine the use of basket currencies as a divergence indicator, or as a financial instrument in regional fina...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was to}} test the correlation between the data of the newly developed device for signaling the strain of rescuers and the indicators of physiological response of the body. Material and Methods The tests were performed on 2 physically fit fire fighters dressed in a protective rescue suit and using insulating breathing apparatus, over a wide range of heat load under a model load on a bicycle ergometer in a climatic chamber. Results The study provided a significant correlation between the body temperature measured in the ear canal and the temperature under the suit sensed by the tested device – the Safety Ambient Monitor (SAM) (R = 0. 9007). The temperature under the suit also correlated with the temperature of the chest skin (R = 0. 8928) and heart rate (R = 0. 8613). Conclusions A statistically significant correlation was proven between the temperature sensed by the SAM and the body temperature. The technical solution of sensing the temperature under the suit using the verified SAM technology does not affect or limit fire fighters in their work and minimizes the possibility of damage to the sensor and signaling failures.

The work is aimed at studying the mineral density of the skeleton bones of the liquidators of the Chernobyl emergency and the inhibitants of the territories, to be controlled on the roentgenobiphoton osteodensitometer XR- 26. The <b>reference</b> <b>indicators</b> of the mineral density of the skeleton bones in lumbar and waist section of the column and distal section of the right spoke bone have been developed. The true reduction of the mineral density of {{the bones of the}} persons, subjected to the radiation effect, depending on the radiation dose and the terms of staying in the radiation zone, has been revealed. The obtained results allow to reveal the variations of the skeleton bones mineral density of 3 % versus 30 %, which allows to perform the adequate treatment effectively and in due timeAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
