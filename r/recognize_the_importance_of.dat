5|$|Murasaki wrote The Diary of Lady Murasaki, {{a volume}} of poetry, and The Tale of Genji. Within a decade of its completion, Genji was {{distributed}} throughout the provinces; within a century it was recognized as a classic of Japanese literature and had become a subject of scholarly criticism. Early in the 20th century her work was translated; a six-volume English translation was completed in 1933. Scholars continue to <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> her work, which reflects Heian court society at its peak. Since the 13th century her works have been illustrated by Japanese artists and well-known ukiyo-e woodblock masters.|$|E
5|$|To <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the Double T to Texas Tech, {{the class}} of 1931 donated the Double T bench. By tradition, freshmen {{are not allowed to}} sit on the bench, which is {{currently}} located in the courtyard of the Administration Building. The logo is further embodied in the Double T neon sign, donated by {{the class of}} 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence.|$|E
5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint {{attention}} is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act. One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing {{and the role of}} eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.|$|E

25|$|Several factors {{contributed to}} {{the desire of the}} {{residents}} of Kentucky to separate from Virginia. First, traveling to the state capital was long and dangerous.

It forbade trade with the Spanish colony of New Orleans, which controlled the mouth of the Mississippi, but this was important to Kentucky communities.|$|E

25|$|The House of Aberffraw was {{displaced}} in 942 by Hywel Dda, a King of Deheubarth from {{a junior}} {{line of descent}} from Rhodri Mawr. This occurred because Idwal Foel, the King of Gwynedd, was determined to cast off English overlordship and took up arms against the new English king, Edmund I. Idwal and his brother Elisedd were both killed in battle against Edmund's forces. By normal custom Idwal's crown should have passed to his sons, Ieuaf and Iago ab Idwal, but Hywel Dda intervened and sent Iago and Ieuaf into exile in Ireland and established himself as ruler over Gwynedd {{until his death in}} 950 when the House of Aberffraw was restored. Nonetheless, surviving manuscripts of Cyfraith Hywel <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the lords of Aberffraw as overlords of Wales along with the rulers of Deheubarth.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{evidence}} that the sockeye salmon are affected by thermal conditions and their responses to temperature are relatively strong and tend to vary from region to region. Canada has also used the Species at Risk Act to <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> biological diversity when it come to the conservation of the salmon population. This means that multiple species of salmon would be looked at {{when it comes to}} conservation as well as multiple areas that each species live in. COSEWIC, a Canadian organization for the conservation of species, has named the Interior Fraser River Coho, the Cultus Lake Sockeye, and the Sakinaw Lake Sockeye to all be endangered. In British Columbia sockeye salmon in four different watersheds were certified by the Marine Stewardship Council, or MSC, as sustainable fisheries in July 2010 and the certification is good for a period of five years. In 2011 MSC also certified the Pink Salmon Fishery and as of 2012 The Chum Salmon Fisheries started their review under the MSC to become certified as a sustainable fishery.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the siege}} Union and Confederate forces kept busy in a {{supporting}} role on the Louisiana side of the Mississippi River. Lt. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, received a telegraph from Pemberton on May 9 requesting a movement against Grant's communication lines along the Mississippi River. Grant had established important supply depots at Milliken's Bend, Young's Point, and Lake Providence within Smith's jurisdiction, but Smith failed to <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> Pemberton's situation. It was not until June when Smith finally decided to take action on Pemberton's request, directing Maj. Gen. Richard Taylor to [...] "do something" [...] {{in favor of the}} Vicksburg garrison. Taylor commanded the District of Western Louisiana and developed a three-pronged campaign against Grant's three supply depots. All three of Taylor's assaults were defeated (see Battle of Milliken's Bend, Battle of Young's Point and Battle of Lake Providence).|$|E

2500|$|The {{mission is}} stated as having three broad themes: Ethical Leadership, Cultural Competence and Community Engagement.

[...] The stated objective of the Cultural Competence component is [...] "students will recognize and respect multiple perspectives and cultures." [...] Two goals have been articulated for the Community Engagement portion of the mission.

2500|$|It is {{estimated}} that 42% of all livestock-related human fatalities {{are a result of}} bull attacks, and only about one in twenty victims of a bull attack survives. Dairy breed bulls are particularly dangerous and unpredictable; the hazards of bull handling are a significant cause of injury and death for dairy farmers {{in some parts of the}} United States. [...] Most cattle breeders <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> looking after expensive bulls that are expected to improve herds and profits. Nonetheless, the dangers of bull handling, particularly from dairy bulls in close quarters, are regularly proven by the obituaries. Good bull management and safety practices require caution in handling beef and dairy bulls, and use of the nose ring and chain is a recommended precaution for modern farmers.|$|E

At the time, the U.S. Army believed that the Sturmgewehr 44 was [...] "intended in a general way to serve the same purpose as the U.S. carbine" [...] and was in many ways inferior to the M1 carbine, and was of [...] "little importance".|$|E
