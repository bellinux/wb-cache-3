In 1967, a <b>redundancy</b> <b>payments</b> scheme was introduced, and in 1970, various improvements in welfare provision for women were introduced. Maternity insurance was extended to all female employees, a social insurance benefit for deserted wives was introduced, a means-tested allowance for unmarried mothers was established, and an earnings-related component was added to the basic flat-rate maternity benefit. In 1967, free secondary education was introduced, together with free transport to school “for those living more than three miles from the nearest school.” In 1972, entitlement to free travel on public transport was introduced for all persons of pensionable age, while people eligible for free hospital care became entitled to prescription drug reimbursement over a certain amount each month.|$|E

25|$|Although {{workers could}} be redundant, the {{employer}} {{may still be}} liable for unfair dismissal by following an unfair procedure. The procedure the employer follows to select employees to make redundant must be procedurally fair. In Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd Browne-Wilkinson J held that the proper steps should be to (1) give all warning possible (2) consult the union (3) agree objective criteria (4) follow those criteria, and (5) always check there if there is alternative employment rather than dismissal. This meant that the managers, who had selected workers {{to lose their jobs}} based on personal preferences, had unfairly dismissed the workforce. The criteria that the employer uses must be observable, and reviewable. However, employers do not need to disclose to employees all the details of their reasoning when they select people for redundancy unless there is a specific complaint of unfairness. A last in, first out policy, as used in many collective agreements will be regarded as fair. For example, in Rolls Royce plc v Unite the Union, Rolls Royce plc challenged a collective agreement which gave extra points in a selection procedure for years of service as being unlawful discrimination against younger workers (who it wished to retain). The Court of Appeal agreed with the union that this represented a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of rewarding seniority, particularly since older workers might find alternative employment much harder to secure. If possible, employers should attempt to redeploy redundant staff within their firm. Under ERA 1996 section 141 an employee should accept a suitable offer for redeployment, and will lose entitlement to redundancy if he or she declines it. 'Suitable' means substantially similar in terms of status, wages and types of duties. For example, in Thomas Wragg & Sons Ltd v Wood the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was reasonable for Mr Wood to refuse an alternative job offer the day before his termination took effect. He was therefore redundant. There is also, under section 138, a right to refuse an alternative job to which an employee is redeployed after a four-week trial period if it would be reasonable. However, redeployment remains an option for the employer that gives it greater scope to avoid <b>redundancy</b> <b>payments.</b> A right for the employee to be redeployed does not yet exist, except {{to the extent that the}} employer must consult about redeployment possibilities when more than 20 employees could be redundant.|$|E

500|$|As AMP, Hewitt was {{responsible}} for reviewing the potential employment of senior officers in the post-war Air Force. This review led to the early retirement of such figures as Air Marshal Richard Williams and Air Vice Marshals Stanley Goble, Bill Bostock, Frank McNamara, Bill Anderson, Henry Wrigley and Adrian Cole, ostensibly {{to make way for}} the advancement of younger and equally capable officers. Hewitt helped draft the letters to each of the retirees, explaining the reasons for the decision and <b>redundancy</b> <b>payments</b> involved. He also had the [...] "thankless task" [...] of rationalising the Air Force List of officers and their seniority, which had become a source of numerous irregularities due to the temporary and acting promotions granted during wartime. This resulted in many officers of senior rank being 'demoted' as many as three levels, such as group captain to flight lieutenant, in the first post-war List released in June 1947.|$|E
50|$|An {{employer}} {{could avoid}} a <b>redundancy</b> <b>payment</b> by dismissing for misconduct during the notice period, {{but only for}} a repudiatory breach, which effectively means the employee would have acted as if he has torn up the employment contract, e.g. by going on strike, emptying the company safe or punching out the managing director.|$|R
5000|$|In (French speaking) Belgium {{the term}} Procédure Renault {{has become a}} synonym for the {{consultation}} process leading to mass redundancies, due to a controversial mass layoff and resultant legislation in the late 1990s. When an employee has been laid off in Australia their employer has to give them redundancy pay, which {{is also known as}} severance pay. The only time that a <b>redundancy</b> <b>payment</b> doesn’t have to be paid is if an employee is casual, working for a small business or has worked for a business for less than twelve months. The <b>redundancy</b> compensation <b>payment</b> for employees depends on the length of time an employee has worked for an employer which excludes unpaid leave. If an employer can’t afford the <b>redundancy</b> <b>payment</b> they are supposed to give their employee, once making them redundant, or they find their employee another job that is suitable for the employee. An employer is able to apply for a reduction in the amount of money they have to pay the employee they have made redundant. An employer can do this by applying to the Fair Work Commission for a <b>redundancy</b> <b>payment</b> reduction. [...] A layoff is also known as a retrenchment in (South African English). In the UK, permanent termination due to elimination of a position is usually called redundancy. [...] Certain countries (such as Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, France and Germany), distinguish between leaving the company of one's own free will, in which case the person is not entitled to unemployment benefits, but may receive a onetime payment and leaving a company as part of a reduction in labour force size, in which case the person is entitled to them. A RIF reduces the number of positions, rather than laying off specific people, and is usually accompanied by internal redeployment.|$|R

2500|$|Redundancies are {{a special}} kind of dismissal, which attract {{specific}} regulation. Since the <b>Redundancy</b> <b>Payments</b> Act 1965, staff must receive a payment for losing their jobs if the employer no longer has an economic need for their job. This policy is designed to internalise some of the social costs that employers create if they dismiss staff, to try and disincentivise unnecessary job losses, and contribute to employees' costs in unemployment. Under ERA 1996 section 162, employees over age 40 receive 1½ weeks' pay per year they had worked, employees aged 22 to 40 receive 1 week's pay per year worked, and employees age 21 or less receive half a week's pay, though the upper limit was £464 per week in 2014. Dismissal for redundancy counts [...] "fair" [...] in substance under ERA 1996 section 98, but the employer may still carry out an unfair procedure to dismiss the redundant employees. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 139, a [...] "redundancy" [...] exists when an employer's demand for an employee's role ceases or diminishes. In situations where employees have lost their jobs, this may be straightforward. In cases where an employer uses its discretion practically to worsen the employees' position the answer may depend on the employees' contracts. In Lesney Products & Co v Nolan a toy company stopped giving its workers overtime. Some refused to work. They were dismissed, and the workers claimed they were redundant. Lord Denning MR held they were not made [...] "redundant" [...] by their terms being changed, even worsened, because [...] "nothing should be done to impair the ability of employers to reorganise their work force and their times and conditions of work so as to improve efficiency." [...] Apparently, they had simply left stopped working of their own accord. This view is controversial, because if the total wage bill spent by the employer is reduced, it would follow that demand for work (reflected in the employer's willingness to pay) must also be diminished. Thus, other courts have suggested the contract terms are irrelevant, and that the test should be purely based on the economic reality of diminished demand. Employers can also argue that a dismissal is for [...] "some other substantial reason". In Hollister v National Farmers’ Union a farmer's refusal to accept decreased pension entitlements, after a consultation process, was said to be a [...] "substantial" [...] reason for dismissal. It is not clear whether worsening employees' contract terms, without their consent or collective approval, was envisaged by the Act as way to evade <b>redundancy</b> <b>payments.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The widow's earning {{rule was}} also abolished, while {{a range of}} new social {{benefits}} was introduced. An Act was passed which replaced National Assistance with Supplementary Benefits. The new Act laid down that people who satisfied its conditions were entitled to these noncontributory benefits. Unlike the National Assistance scheme, which operated like state charity for the worst-off, the new Supplementary Benefits scheme was a right of every citizen who found himself or herself in severe difficulties. Those persons over the retirement age with no means who {{were considered to be}} unable to live on the basic pension (which provided less than what the government deemed as necessary for subsistence) became entitled to a [...] "long term" [...] allowance of an extra few shillings a week. Some simplification of the procedure for claiming benefits was also introduced. From 1966, an exceptionally severe disablement allowance was added “for those claimants receiving constant attendance allowance which was paid to those with the higher or intermediate rates of constant attendance allowance and who were exceptionally severely disabled.” <b>Redundancy</b> <b>payments</b> were introduced in 1965 to lessen the impact of unemployment, and earnings-related benefits for maternity, unemployment, sickness, industrial injuries and widowhood were introduced in 1966, followed by the replacement of flat-rate family allowances with an earnings-related scheme in 1968. From July 1966 onwards, the temporary allowance for widow of severely disabled pensioners was extended from 13 to 26 weeks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{priority}} list in insolvency sees creditors with fixed security (typically banks) get paid first. Second are preferential creditors. Third are unsecured creditors up to {{a limit of}} £600,000. Fourth are floating charge holders (usually banks again). Fifth are remaining debts to unsecured creditors (in the unlikely event that anything remains). Sixth are [...] "deferred debts" [...] (typically to company insiders). Last are shareholders. Among the preferential creditors, the insolvency practitioners' fees together with adopted contracts attain super-priority. Otherwise, employees wages and pensions still have preferential status, but only up to an £800 limit, a figure which has remained unchanged since 1986. Employees having priority among creditors, albeit not above fixed security holders, dates back to 1897, and is justified {{on the ground that}} employees are particularly incapable, unlike banks, of diversifying their risk, and forms one of the requirements in the ILO Protection of Workers' Claims (Employer's Insolvency) Convention. Often this limited preference is not enough, and can {{take a long time to}} realise. Reflecting the Insolvency Protection Directive under ERA 1996 section 166 any employee may lodge a claim with the National Insurance Fund for outstanding wages. Under ERA 1996 section 182 the amount claimable is the same as that for unfair dismissal (£350 in 2010) for a limit of 8 weeks. If an employee has been unpaid for a longer period, she may choose the most beneficial 8 weeks. The Pensions Act 2004 governs a separate system for protecting pension claims, through the Pension Protection Fund. This aims to fully insure all pension claims. Together with minimum <b>redundancy</b> <b>payments,</b> the guarantees of wages form a meagre cushion which requires more of a systematic supplementation when people remain unemployed.|$|E

50|$|Except when ACAS {{have been}} {{involved}} and arranged a COT3 settlement, COT3 being {{the name of the}} form used, compromise agreements are the only means whereby an employee can waive statutory claims such as unfair dismissal, discrimination or entitlements to a <b>redundancy</b> <b>payment.</b> The agreement will only be valid where (i) it is in writing and (ii) the employee has received independent legal advice from a relevant adviser who has professional indemnity insurance. An employee cannot compromise potential future claims, though claims that have already arisen, unknown to the employee, can be waived. The Employment Rights Act 1996 provides at Section 203 for the conditions relating to the validity of Compromise Agreements. The Equality Act 2010 also regulates the conditions for the validity of Compromise Agreements, but a possible drafting error may have affected the scope of Compromise Agreements to settle discrimination complaints.|$|R
2500|$|The {{right to}} secure employment, either in one's current job or {{in a job}} that utilises a person's skills in the most {{socially}} productive way, is usually seen as crucial {{for the success of}} the economy and human development. The aim is to counterbalance the destructive effect on productivity and social costs that come from abuse of managerial power. Consistent with minimal international standards, employees in the United Kingdom have three principal job security rights, introduced originally by the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, the <b>Redundancy</b> <b>Payments</b> Act 1965 and the Industrial Relations Act 1971. First, after one month's work an employee must have at least one week's notice before any dismissal, unless there has been gross misconduct. This minimum rises to two weeks after two years, three weeks after three years, and so on, up to twelve weeks after twelve years. Second, after two years' work, the dismissal must be fair. This means the employer must have a justification based on an employee's capability, conduct, redundancy or another good reason, or the employee can claim damages or the job back from an Employment Tribunal. Third, also after two years' work and if dismissed because the enterprise no longer needs someone doing the employee's job, there is a right to a redundancy payment. Like the notice period, redundancy pay increases according to the number of years worked. Contracts should usually go beyond this bare minimum, but cannot go below. Compared to its European and Commonwealth counterparts, jobs in the UK are relatively insecure. Workers have few ways, except pressure through collective bargaining, to challenge a management's decision about dismissals before they take place. When collective redundancies are proposed, however, EU law has introduced a requirement that employers consult on changes. EU law also introduced a rule that if a business is transferred, for instance, during a merger or acquisition, employees may not have their terms worsened or lose their jobs without a good economic, technical or organisational reason. If employees do lose their work, they may fall back on a minimal system of state insurance, funded primarily through income tax or National Insurance, to collect a [...] "jobseekers allowance", and may make use of public employment agencies to find employment again. The UK government has in the past aimed to create [...] "full employment" [...] however this goal has not necessarily translated into secure and stable work.|$|E
