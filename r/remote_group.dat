It is the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, lying [...] from the nearest inhabited land, Saint Helena, and [...] from the nearest continental land, South Africa. It is [...] from South America. The territory consists of the main island, named Tristan da Cunha, which has a north–south length of [...] and an area of , along with the smaller, uninhabited Nightingale Islands and the wildlife reserves of Inaccessible and Gough islands. As of January 2017, the main island has 262 permanent inhabitants. The other islands are uninhabited, except for the personnel of a weather station on Gough Island.|$|E

What chiefly {{concerned}} them was defence against Asiatic raiders swooping for petrol or to destroy weapons or communications. Everywhere levies were being formed {{at that time to}} defend the plant of the railroads day and night in the hope that communication would speedily be restored. The land war was still far away. A man with a flat voice distinguished himself by a display of knowledge and cunning. He told them all with confidence just what had been wrong with the German drachenflieger and the American aeroplanes, just what advantage the Japanese flyers possessed. He launched out into a romantic description of the Butteridge machine and riveted Bert's attention. [...] "I SEE that," [...] said Bert, and was smitten silent by a thought. The man with the flat voice talked on, without heeding him, of the strange irony of Butteridge's death. At that Bert had a little twinge of relief--he would never meet Butteridge again. It appeared Butteridge had died suddenly, very suddenly.|$|E

Specifically, the study examines the effects communication modality {remote vs. face-to-face) and information load on the types of social influence used by group members and the amount of group polarization or choice shift exhibited by group members. The findings suggest that face-to-face groups use more informational influence than <b>remote</b> <b>groups</b> and that this difference increases as information load increases.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{enhanced}} {{version of the}} routing protocol Landmark Ad Hoc Routing (LANMAR). LANMAR combines the features of Fisheye State Routing (FSR) and Landmark routing. The enhanced version features landmark election {{to cope with the}} dynamic and mobile environment. Other advantages of LANMAR include the use of landmarks for each logical group (e. g., a team of co-workers at a convention or a tank battalion in the battlefield) in order to reduce routing update overhead in large networks, and the exchanging of neighborhood link state only with neighbors. When network size grows, <b>remote</b> <b>groups</b> of nodes are "summarized" by the corresponding landmarks. As a result, each node will maintain accurate routing information about immediate neighborhood; {{at the same time it}} will keep track of the routing directions to the landmark nodes and thus, to <b>remote</b> <b>groups.</b> Simulation experiments show that the enhanced version suffers some performance degradation at steady state because of el [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Remote {{monitoring}} (RM) {{in patients}} with advanced heart failure and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (CRT-D) may reduce delays in clinical decisions by transmitting automatic alerts. However, this strategy has never been tested specifically in this patient population, with alerts for lung fluid overload, and in a European setting. Objective: The main objective of Phase 1 (presented here) is to evaluate if RM strategy is able to reduce time from device-detected events to clinical decisions. Methods: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, patients with moderate to severe heart failure implanted with CRT-D devices were randomized to a <b>Remote</b> <b>group</b> (with remote follow-up and wireless automatic alerts) or to a Control group (with standard follow-up without alerts). The primary endpoint of Phase 1 was the delay between an alert event and clinical decisions related to the event in the first 154 enrolled patients followed for 1 year. Results: The median delay from device-detected events to clinical decisions was considerably shorter in the <b>Remote</b> <b>group</b> compared to the Control group: 2 (25 th- 75 th percentile, 1 - 4) days vs 29 (25 th- 75 th percentile, 3 - 51) days respectively, P=. 004. In-hospital visits were reduced in the <b>Remote</b> <b>group</b> (2. 0 visits/patient/year vs 3. 2 visits/patient/year in the Control group, 37. 5 % relative reduction, P<. 001). Automatic alerts were successfully transmitted in 93 % of events occurring outside the hospital in the <b>Remote</b> <b>group.</b> The annual rate of all-cause hospitalizations per patient did not differ {{between the two groups}} (P=. 65). Conclusions: RM in CRT-D patients with advanced heart failure allows physicians to promptly react to clinically relevant automatic alerts and significantly reduces the burden of in-hospital visits...|$|E
40|$|Collaborative improvisation, composition, and {{performance}} of music constitute a basic and distinctive form of human interaction. Across cultures, the production and enjoyment of music is typically an open, collaborative, activity more analogous to informal conversation or story telling than to a formal lecture.

In this paper we present a design for a <b>remote</b> <b>group</b> music improvisation environment and a evaluation framework based on psychoanalytic theories of attunement between mother and baby in early development.

40|$|Small-world {{phenomenon}} {{has been observed}} in existing peer-to-peer (P 2 P) networks, such as Gnutella and Freenet. Due to the similarity of P 2 P networks to social networks, the previous small-world model proposed by Duncan Watts can be adopted {{in the design of}} P 2 P networks: each node is connected to some neighbouring nodes, and a group of nodes keep a small number of long links to randomly chosen distant nodes. Unfortunately, current unstructured search algorithms have difficulty distinguishing these random long-range shortcuts. This paper presents small world architecture for P 2 P networks (SWAN) with a semi-structured P 2 P search algorithm that is used to create and find long-range shortcuts toward <b>remote</b> peer <b>groups.</b> In SWAN, not every peer node needs to be connected to <b>remote</b> <b>groups,</b> but every peer node can easily find which peer nodes have external connections to a specific peer group. </p...|$|R

Beginning with the standard environment, a videoconferencing design has been developed iteratively according to information obtained from the experimental group.
