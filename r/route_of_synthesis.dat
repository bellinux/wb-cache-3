50|$|Regardless of the details, an {{outstanding}} {{issue is that}} the physiological <b>route</b> <b>of</b> NAADP <b>synthesis</b> has still not been unequivocally identified — neither the reaction(s) nor the enzyme(s). Clearly, it is theoretically possible there may be multiple <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>synthesis,</b> but this would be unprecedented in the second messenger world. To date, the most favoured hypothesis is the so-called base-exchange reaction (nicotinic acid + NADP → NAADP + nicotinamide; catalyzed by ADP-ribosyl cyclases) which are a family of enzymes that include CD38 and CD157 in mammals (and orthologs in sea urchin and Aplysia ovotestis). These were first discovered as the synthetic enzymes for cADPR but later revealed to be multifunctional, promiscuous enzymes that can also produce NAADP. Certainly NAADP production can occur in vitro but whether it occurs in vivo is another question (because genetic knockout or knock-down of ADP-ribosyl cyclases {{has no effect on}} NAADP production in some cell types), and there may be other routes which require different substrates and enzymes.|$|R

40|$|Background: Estimated annual {{incidence}} of MDR-TB is 480, 000, representing 5 % of TB incidence, but 20 % of mortality. Multiple drugs {{have recently been}} developed or re-purposed {{for the treatment of}} MDR-TB. Currently, treatment for MDR-TB costs thousands of dollars per course. Objectives: To estimate generic prices for novel TB drugs that would be possible given large-scale competitive manufacture. Methods: Prices for linezolid, moxifloxacin, and clofazimine were estimated based on per-kilogram prices of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Other costs were added, including formulation, packaging and a profit margin. The costs of projection for sutezolid were estimated to be equivalent to those for linezolid, based on chemical similarit y. Generic prices for bedaquiline, delamanid, and pretomanid were estimated by assessing <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>synthesis,</b> costs/kg <b>of</b> chemical reagents, <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>synthesis,</b> and per-step yields. Costing algorithms reflected variable regulatory requirements, efficiency of scale based on demand, and were validated by testing predictive ability against widely-available TB medicines. Results: Estimated generic prices were USD $ 8 -$ 17 /month for bedaquiline, $ 5 -$ 16 /month for delamanid, $ 11 -$ 3 /month for pretomanid, $ 4 -$ 9 /month for linezolid, $ 4 -$ 9 /month for sutezolid, $ 4 -$ 11 /month for clofazimine, and $ 4 -$ 8 /month for moxifloxacin. Estimated generic prices were 87 %- 94 % lower than current lowest available prices for bedaquiline, 95 %- 98 % for delamanid, 94 %- 97 % for linezolid. Estimated generic prices were $ 168 -$ 395 per course for the STREAM trial modified Bangladesh regimens (current cost s $ 734 -$ 1, 799), $ 53 -$ 276 for pretomanid-based three-drug regimens, and $ 238 -$ 507 for a delamanid-based four-drug regimen.
