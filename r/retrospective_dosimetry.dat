Eight fractions, {{ranging in size from}} < 75 micrometers to 2 mm, were prepared from one tooth. Two cases were investigated: crushing of a non-irradiated sample and of a sample previously irradiated (6 Gy from `Co gamma ray source). In the non-irradiated study, the intensity of the native signal at 2. 0045 in by circa 1. 75 times as the grain size decreased from maximum to minimum. A small in radiation sensitivity (< 8 %) was also observed with decreasing grain size. In the irradiated samples, crushing resulted in slight variations of reconstructed doses from expected values, but the worst possible case (grain sizes < 75 micron) showed that additional errors were less than 10 %. The radiation sensitivity of enamel measured immediately after exposure is underestimated. It increases by about 15 % in the first month.

40|$|International audiencePurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine a new {{approach}} to <b>retrospective</b> biological <b>dosimetry,</b> by using a long-term animal model to determine the stability of translocation frequency after in vivo irradiation. While the frequency of dicentrics is known to decrease over time, the persistence of more stable chromosomal aberrations such as translocations could be useful if their stability were definitively proved. Materials and Methods: Four monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were exposed to two different doses of ionising radiation: 2 Gy whole body irradiation for two and 4 Gy for two others. Blood samples were obtained at various times after irradiation. Both total and two-way translocations were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Translocations were scored in stable cells, that is, those without dicentrics, rings or fragments. The course of translocation frequency was analysed at four time-points: one hour (H 1), 2 months (M 2), 10 months (M 10) and 31 months (M 31) after irradiation. Results: We observed two separate trends in translocation frequency: total translocation frequency decreased slightly in animals irradiated with a dose of 2 Gy, while two-way translocation frequency was relatively stable in all irradiated animals. Conclusions: We confirmed the long-term stability of translocations and found that it seems to depend on the type of the translocation recorded. Overall translocations were stable for up to 31 months regardless of dose, but two-way translocations were more stable than those that were non-reciprocal, especially in stable cells...|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{distributions}} of soil contamination by 137 Cs (89 sampling points) and 239 + 240 pu (76 points) near and within Dolon village were analyzed. An essential exponential decrease of contamination {{was found in}} Dolon village: the distance of a half reduction in contamination is about 0. 87 - 1. 25 km (in a northwest-southeast direction from the supposed centerline of the radioactive trace). This fact is {{in agreement with the}} available exposure rate measurements near Dolon (September 1949 archive data) : {{on the basis of a}} few measurements the pattern of the trace was estimated to comprise a narrow 2 km corridor of maximum exposure rate. To compare computed external doses in air with local dose estimates by <b>retrospective</b> luminescence <b>dosimetry</b> (RLD) the gradient of radioactive soil contamination within the village was accounted for. The computed dose associated with the central axis of the trace was found to be equal to 2260 mGy (calculations based on archive exposure rate data). Local doses near the RLD sampling points (southeast of the village) were calculated to be in the range 466 - 780 mGy (averaged value: 645 +/- 70 mGy), which is comparable with RLD data (averaged value 460 +/- 92 mGy with range 380 - 618 mGy). A comparison of the computed mean dose in the settlement with dose estimates by ESR tooth enamel dosimetry makes it possible to estimate the "upper level" of the "shielding and behavior" factor in dose reduction for inhabitants of Dolon village which was found to be 0. 28 +/- 0. 068...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Dosimetric {{accuracy}} depends directly {{upon the}} accuracy of the activity measurements in tumors and organs. The authors present the methods and results of a <b>retrospective</b> tumor <b>dosimetry</b> analysis in 14 patients with a total of 28 tumors treated with high activities of (153) Sm-ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate ((153) Sm-EDTMP) for therapy of metastatic osteosarcoma using planar images and compare the results with three-dimensional dosimetry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of phantom data provided a complete set of parameters for dosimetric calculations, including buildup factor, attenuation coefficient, and camera dead-time compensation. The latter was obtained using a previously developed methodology that accounts for the relative motion of the camera and patient during whole-body (WB) imaging. Tumor activity values calculated from the anterior and posterior views of WB planar images of patients treated with (153) Sm-EDTMP for pediatric osteosarcoma were compared with the geometric mean value. The mean activities were integrated over time and tumor-absorbed doses were calculated using the software package OLINDA/EXM. RESULTS: The authors found that it was necessary to employ the dead-time correction algorithm to prevent measured tumor activity half-lives from often exceeding the physical decay half-life of (153) Sm. Measured half-lives so long are unquestionably in error. Tumor-absorbed doses varied between 0. 0022 and 0. 27 cGy/MBq with an average of 0. 065 cGy/MBq; however, a comparison with absorbed dose values derived from a three-dimensional analysis for the same tumors showed no correlation; moreover, the ratio of three-dimensional absorbed dose value to planar absorbed dose value was 2. 19. From the anterior and posterior activity comparisons, the order of clinical uncertainty for activity and dose calculations from WB planar images, with the present methodology, is hypothesized to be about 70 %. CONCLUSION: The dosimetric results from clinical patient data indicate that absolute planar dosimetry is unreliable and dosimetry using three-dimensional imaging is preferable, particularly for tumors, except perhaps for the most sophisticated planar methods. The relative activity and patient kinetics derived from planar imaging show a greater level of reliability than the dosimetry...|$|R

40|$|If an {{accident}} or attack involving radiological or nuclear material were to happen, people from the general public would be at risk of exposure to ionising radiation. Unlike people working with ionising radiation, for whom level of exposure to radiation is constantly monitored with dosemeters, people {{from the general population}} do not wear dosemeters; thus, the dose estimations for these individuals must be performed using alternative methods. This field of research is called <b>retrospective</b> <b>dosimetry</b> (or emergency dosimetry) and includes both biological and physical techniques. Following {{an accident}} or attack, dose estimations of potentially exposed individuals have to be performed as soon as possible, to give the proper medical care promptly and, {{especially in the case of}} a large-scale incident, to use the available resources in the best and most effective manner. In contrast to developing conventional dosemeter material, the approach for research into retrospective dosemeter materials is somewhat reversed. Instead of involving identification (or development) of a material that meets the set requirements, the work needs to conform to the properties of the materials found near or on people. This necessity often means that several materials/techniques are needed to fulfil the same requirements. In addition, exactly which materials will be present in a given situation is never certain, and the addition of new materials/methods that could be used for <b>retrospective</b> <b>dosimetry</b> thus is always a valuable contribution. In this thesis, a number of materials found in the immediate vicinity of people have been investigated with regard to their potential to act as retrospective radiation dosemeters using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). The materials include human teeth and dental repair materials, components from electronic devices, desiccants, and common household salt (NaCl). The aim is both to increase the number of materials that could be used with OSL and to further develop methods for the materials already known to have some dosimetric properties. The overall conclusion of this work is that several materials found on or in the immediate vicinity of people can be used in <b>retrospective</b> <b>dosimetry</b> using OSL. Also, initial estimations of conversion factors for the transition between the dose to the retrospective dosemeter material and the dose to an individual have been obtained using an anthropomorphic phantom...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Some cancer {{survivors}} {{are known to}} have an elevated risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. An important cause of this elevated risk is recognised to be irradiation of normal tissues during radiotherapy received as part of cancer therapy. There are substantial difficulties in studying radiation-related cardiovascular disease (RRCD). The reasons for this include the complexities of measuring radiation normal tissue doses retrospectively and the prolonged latencies of many of the cardiovascular endpoints. A variety of complimentary research methodologies can help provide additional knowledge to guide the appropriate management of patients treated in the past and of new patients in the future. Methods: 1) A cohort study of mortality from circulatory disease in the nationwide British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (BCCSS). 2) A case-control study of valvular heart disease (VHD) in Dutch Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors, including <b>retrospective</b> radiation <b>dosimetry</b> to estimate the radiation dose to heart valves. 3) A dosimetric study of cardiovascular radiation doses in patients entered into the UK NCRI Lymphoma Study Group RAPID trial, including predictions of 15 -year cardiac mortality using innovative methods. 4) A modelling study to predict mean whole heart dose (MWHD) from involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) for HL using anatomical measures. 5) A prospective study using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging to characterise the heart in women receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer. Results: 1) The risks of all types of circulatory mortality are elevated in survivors of childhood cancer. The absolute excess risks continue to increase 40 + years following diagnosis. The risk of death from cardiomyopathy and heart failure increased substantially with the introduction of anthracycline chemotherapy. There is no evidence of a reduction in risk of circulatory mortality in more recent eras of diagnosis. 2) There is a strong relationship between estimated radiation dose to the affected heart valve and the risk of subsequent VHD (p Conclusions: Using a variety of methods these studies have all succeeded in adding to knowledge about the nature, magnitude and timing of RRCD. This knowledge can be used to help the future management of cancer patients. In addition, each of the studies has natural and planned extensions and will continue to contribute further knowledge into the future. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} an {{analytical}} {{overview of the}} main results presented at the 3 rd Dosimetry Workshop in Hiroshima(9 - 11 of March 2005), where {{different aspects of the}} dose reconstruction around the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site(SNTS) were discussed and summarized. The results of the international intercomparison of the retrospective luminescence dosimetry(RLD) method for Dolon' village(Kazakhstan) were presented at the Workshop and good concurrence between dose estimations by different laboratories from 6 countries (Japan, Russia, USA, Germany, Finland and UK) was pointed out. The accumulated dose values in brick for a common depth of 10 mm depth obtained independently by all participating laboratories were in good agreement for all four brick samples from Dolon' village, Kazakhstan, with the average value of the local gamma dose due to fallout (near the sampling locations) being about 220 mGy(background dose has been subtracted). Furthermore, using a conversion factor of about 2 to obtain the free-in-air dose, a value of local dose ~ 440 mGy is obtained, which supports the results of external dose calculations for Dolon': recently published soil contamination data, archive information and new models were used for refining dose calculations and the external dose in air for Dolon village was estimated to be about 500 mGy. The results of electron spin resonance(ESR) dosimetry with tooth enamel have demonstrated the notable progress in application of ESR dosimetry to the problems of dose reconstruction around the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site. At the present moment, dose estimates by the ESR method have become more consistent with calculated values and with <b>retrospective</b> luminescence <b>dosimetry</b> data, but differences between ESR dose estimates and RLD/calculation data were noted. For example mean ESR dose for eligible tooth samples from Dolon' village was estimated to be about 140 mGy(above background dose), which is less than dose values obtained by RLD and calculations. A possible explanation of the differences between ESR and RLD/calculations doses is the following: for interpretation of ESR data the "shielding and behaviour" factors for investigated persons should be taken into account. The "upper level" of the combination of "shielding and behaviour" factors of dose reduction for inhabitants of Dolon' village of about 0. 28 was obtained by comparing the individual ESR tooth enamel dose estimates with the calculated mean dose for this settlement. The biological dosimetry data related to the settlements near SNTS were presented at the Workshop. A higher incidence of unstable chromosome aberrations, micronucleus in lymphocytes, nuclear abnormalities of thyroid follicular cells, T-cell receptor mutations in peripheral blood were found for exposed areas (Dolon', Sarjal) in comparison with unexposed ones(Kokpekty). The significant greater frequency of stable translocations (results of analyses of chromosome aberrations in lymphocytes by the FISH technique) was demonstrated for Dolon' village in comparison with Chekoman(unexposed village). The elevated level of stable translocations in Dolon' corresponds to a dose of about 180 mSv, which is close to the results of ESR dosimetry for this village. The importance of investigating specific morphological types of thyroid nodules for thyroid dosimetry studies was pointed out. In general the 3 rd Dosimetry Workshop has demonstrated remarkable progress in developing an international level of common approaches for retrospective dose estimations around the SNTS and in understanding the tasks for the future joint work in this direction. In the framework of a special session the problems of developing a database and registry in order to support epidemiological studies around SNTS were discussed. The results of investigation of psychological consequences of nuclear tests, which are expressed in the form of verbal behaviour, were presented at this session as well...|$|R

The sampling sites covered areas almost not affected by fallout from the Chernobyl accident such as Moscow/Russia and the Zhitomir district in Ukraine as well as the highly contaminated Korosten and Narodici districts in Ukraine. I- 129 was analyzed by radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA) and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). I- 127 was measured for some profiles by RNAA or ion chromatography (IC). The results for I- 127 demonstrated large differences in the capabilities of the soils to store iodine over long time spans. The depth profiles of I- 129 and of (CS) -C- 137 showed large differences in the migration behavior between the two nuclides but also for each nuclide among the different sampling sites. Though it cannot be quantified how much I- 129 and (CS) - C- 137 was lost out of the soil columns into deeper depths, the inventories in the columns were taken as proxies for the total inventories. For I- 129, these inventories were at least three orders of magnitude higher than a pre-nuclear value of 0. 084 +/- 0. 017 mBq m(- 2) derived from a soil profile taken in 1939 in Lutovinovo/Russia. From the samples from Moscow and Zhitomir, a pre-Chernobyl I- 129 inventory of (44 24) mBq m- 2 was determined, limiting the feasibility of I- 129 <b>retrospective</b> <b>dosimetry</b> to areas where the I- 129 inventories exceed 100 mBq m(- 2). Higher average I- 129 inventories in the Korosten and Narodici districts of 130 and 848 mBq m(- 2), respectively, allowed determination of the I- 129 fallout: due to the Chernobyl accident.

Subsequently, the construction and features of an automatic luminescence measuring system are mentioned together with innovative methods of decreasing the background level for the RTL measurement. Practical ap-plications to dosimetry and dating are then described from the viewpoints of the preferable nature of RTL in comparison to other luminescence observations. Finally, some recent advances in RTL re-search are presented based on their emission mechanism correlated with impurity contents...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{assessments}} of doses received by individuals exposed to radiation from nuclear {{accidents and incidents}} such as those at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Nevada test site, Cheliabinsk and Mayak are required for epidemiological studies seeking to establish relationships between radiation dose and health effects. One method of <b>retrospective</b> <b>dosimetry</b> which allows for measurement of cumulative gamma ray doses received by exposed individuals is electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) of tooth enamel. Tooth enamel stores and retains, indefinitely, information on absorbed radiation dose. And teeth are available in every population {{as a result of}} dental extraction for medical reasons including periodontal disease and impacted wisdom teeth. In the case of children, deciduous teeth, which are shed between the ages of 7 and 13, can be a very important dosimetric source if documented collection is implemented shortly following an accident...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the radiation-induced electron paramagnetic resonance signal in sweeteners xylitol and sorbitol for use in <b>retrospective</b> <b>dosimetry.</b> For both sweeteners and chewing gum, the signal changed at an interval of 1 – 84 d after irradiation with minimal changes after 4 – 8 d. A dependence on storage conditions was noticed and the exposure of the samples to light and humidity was therefore minimised. Both the xylitol and sorbitol signals showed linearity with dose in the measured dose interval, 0 – 20 Gy. The dose-response measurements for the chewing gum resulted in a decision threshold of 0. 38 Gy and a detection limit of 0. 78 Gy. A blind test illustrated the possibility of using chewing gums as a retrospective dosemeter with an uncertainty in the dose determination of 0. 17 Gy (1 SD) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The use of {{thermoluminescence}} (TL) as {{a method}} for radiation dosimetry of ionizing radiation has been established for many decades and has found many useful applications in various fields, such as personnel and environmental monitoring, <b>retrospective</b> <b>dosimetry,</b> medical dosimetry, space dosimetry, high-dose dosimetry. Method of preparation, studies and applications of thermoluminescence (TL) dosimetric materials are reviewed. Several high sensitivity thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) are now commercially available in different physical forms. These commercial TL dosimeters comply {{with a set of}} stringent requirements stipulated by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Specific features of TL phosphors for thermal neutron, fast neutron and high-energy charged particle (HCP) dosimetry are also considered. Some of the recent developments in the field of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiophotoluminescence (RPL) are also summarized. Comparative advantages of TL, OSL and RPL dosimeters are given. Results of recent studies of TL in nanosized materials are briefly presented...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} a {{five year}} {{effort to improve}} the sensitivity and reliability of <b>retrospective</b> <b>dosimetry</b> methods, to collaborate with laboratories engaged in related research and to share the technology with startup laboratories seeking similar capabilities. This research program has focused on validation of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) as a dosimetry tool and on optimization of the technique by reducing the lower limits of detection, simplifying the process of sample preparation and analysis and speeding analysis to allow greater throughput in routine measurement situations. The authors have investigated the dosimetric signal of hard tissues in enamel, deorganified dentin, synthetic carbonated apatites and synthetic hydroxyapatite. This research {{has resulted in a}} total of 27 manuscripts which have been published, are in press, or have been submitted for publication. Of these manuscripts, 14 are included in this report and were indexed separately for inclusion in the data base...|$|E
40|$|Methods of <b>retrospective</b> <b>dosimetry,</b> {{including}} luminescence and {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} spectroscopy (EPR), rely on {{measurement of}} accident dose absorbed by naturally occurring materials - ceramics {{in the case of}} both thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and organic materials and bio- minerals in the case of EPR. Each of these methods relies on measurement of radiation defects resulting from accidental exposure. Since defects also result from natural sources of radiation over the lifetime of a sample, analysis is usually restricted to materials for which the natural dose may be determined and subtracted from the measured cumulative dose. Luminescence dating techniques rely heavily on an accurate assessment of cumulative dose from natural radiation sources, and dating research has provided us with the bulk of our knowledge in this area. Virtually all of the work on natural dose determination can be directly applied to retrospective techniques. With EPR techniques the cumulative dose from diagnostic x- rays is also of importance...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the thermoluminiscence (TL) {{sensitivity}} of quartz due to heat and irradiation treatments is of importance in dating and <b>retrospective</b> <b>dosimetry.</b> A comprehensive comparative {{study of the}} predose effect was carried out for three types of quartz of different origin. Complete TL vs. dose and sensitivity S vs. predose curves were obtained for the dose range of 0. 1 <D< 400 Gy. Additional complete sensitivity vs. predose curves were obtained for samples which underwent a combined predose irradiation and a subsequent heat treatment to 500 C. Although the TL vs. dose curves showed very different behaviours, the sensitivity vs. predose curves showed several common characteristics. The sensitivity vs. predose curves showed abrupt changes 10 Gy. The sensitivity after a combined predose irradiation and heat treatment to 500 C showed a very gradual change in the whole dose range studied. These results are explained qualitatively by using the modified Zimmerman model for quartz...|$|E
