40|$|Comprised {{of three}} regular battalions of infantry, 2 nd Battalion The South Wales Borderers, 2 nd Battalion The Essex Regiment, 2 nd Battalion The Gloucester Regiment and Brigade HQ, 56 th (Independent) Infantry Brigade was only formed in early March 1944. Its {{specific}} {{task was to}} land 'under command' of 50 th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division on D-Day. This Division itself {{was made up of}} three brigades of very experienced infantry. What <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> 56 <b>th</b> Infantry Brigade's infantry battalions had all been on Home Service since June 1940 and were not experienced in battle. Despite this, within only thirteen weeks of formation, 56 th Infantry Brigade task was to land on Gold Beach on D-Day as follow up troops and fight inland taking the town of Bayeux by nightfall. After this the Brigade was expected to provide infantry for 7 th Armoured Division in a quick push south to take Villers-Bocage. This study traces the journey made by the three battalions of 56 th Brigade from 1940 through to a very concentrated forming up and training period specific to the Normandy landings in 1944. It follows their actions from the landings through to the taking of Le Havre in September 1944, by which time the Brigade had served in four different divisions and lost its 'Independent' title to become a permanent member of 49 th (West Riding) Infantry Division {{for the remainder of the}} war in North West Europe. No study has previously been made of 56 th Infantry Brigade and extensive use has been made of primary evidence from The National Archives and other sources in this investigation. A considerable amount of new evidence has been gathered by interviews with surviving veterans of 56 th Infantry Brigade. The evidence is used to explore issues that shed new light on life in the Army at home during the war, training for war and the Normandy Campaign...|$|R
40|$|Phosphine is {{the only}} {{economically}} viable fumigant for routine control of insect pests of stored food products, but its continued use is now threatened by the world-wide emergence of high-level resistance in key pest species. Phosphine has a unique mode of action relative to well-characterised contact pesticides. Similarly, the selective pressures that lead to resistance against field sprays differ dramatically from those encountered during fumigation. The consequences of these differences have not been investigated adequately. We determine the genetic basis of phosphine resistance in Rhyzopertha dominica strains collected from New South Wales and South Australia and compare this with resistance in a previously characterised strain from Queensland. The resistance levels range from 225 and 100 times the baseline response of a sensitive reference strain. Moreover, molecular and phenotypic data indicate <b>that</b> high-level resistance <b>was</b> derived independently {{in each of the}} three widely separated geographical regions. Despite the independent origins, resistance was due to two interacting genes in each instance. Furthermore, complementation analysis reveals that all three strains contain an incompletely recessive resistance allele of the autosomal rph 1 resistance gene. This is particularly noteworthy as a resistance allele at rph 1 was previously proposed to be a necessary first step in the evolution of high-level resistance. Despite the capacity of phosphine to disrupt a wide range of enzymes and biological processes, it <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> <b>th...</b>|$|R
40|$|How does {{language}} change {{take place}} and could developments be predictable? In this study, Arjen Versloot evaluates these questions, supported by {{analysis of the}} decline in the use of unstressed vowels in the Frisian language between 1300 and 1550. This decline is found, for example, in the words: Old Frisian sitta ‘to sit’ > Modern Frisian sitte and Old Frisian sone ‘son’ > Modern Frisian soan. The study presents two models of language change. Model one considers the duration and intensity of vowels in individual words, rather than abstract, underlying phonemes. The order and timing of vowel reduction can thus be predicted with 95 % accuracy over a period of 200 years. In the second model, the language user is regarded as a ‘calculating speaker’, evaluating what he hears from others, estimating the reception by listeners, and a little lazy in his articulation. With an accuracy of over 90 %, the model predicts the order and timing of changes in verbal and nominal endings where vowel reduction is involved. These results of the study support the hypothesis of language as a deterministic, dynamic system, where the ‘grammar’ and its change are the outcome of self-organization in the language system. The models are fed with detailed data from late-mediaeval Frisian texts, providing a significant amount of new information about Open Syllable Lengthening, Vowel Balance, Vowel Harmony and Apocope/Syncope. One of the <b>remarkable</b> conclusions <b>is</b> <b>that</b> 15 <b>th</b> and 16 th centuries Frisian was probably a tonal language, just like modern Norwegian. ...|$|R
