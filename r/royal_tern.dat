Finds included an early Miocene loon Colymboides minutus, various ducks, a crested tern closely resembling the modern <b>royal</b> <b>tern</b> Sterna maxima, {{and a member of the}} crow genus, one of the few fossil passerine birds from that period. The review found that fossil birds from this period generally closely resemble a modern species or genus, and those that do not can usually be placed in a modern family with a fair degree of confidence.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed tropicbird can be {{differentiated}} {{from the}} other tropicbirds by its red bill in combination with its white tail streamers. The slightly smaller red-tailed tropicbird has red rather than white tail streamers, and the white-tailed tropicbird can be differentiated by its smaller size, black stripe along its upperwing coverts, and its yellow-orange bill. Juvenile red-billed tropicbirds have more heavily barred upperparts than juveniles of other species. In flight, the <b>royal</b> <b>tern</b> can {{be confused with the}} adult red-billed tropicbird but can be distinguished by the former's less direct flight pattern and its lack of tail streamers.|$|E
5|$|As of 2007, the {{following}} reviews are underway: {{a review of}} past records of Macaronesian shearwaters, reviews of all redhead and <b>royal</b> <b>tern</b> records, a review of great white egrets to establish if any are of the Nearctic race, a review of sandplovers, a review of records of the eastern race of redstart, a review of Orphean warbler records aimed at determining the race of each, and a review of subalpine warblers to determine which individuals are ascribable to the race albistriata. It has also been suggested that reviews should be conducted of records of great snipe, as older records show a very different temporal occurrence pattern than more recent birds, {{the large numbers of}} gull-billed tern records from the English south coast from the 1960s, and desert wheatears, to establish racial identifications.|$|E

The <b>royal</b> <b>tern</b> feeds on small crabs, such as young blue crabs that swim near {{the surface of the}} water. When feeding on small crabs the <b>royal</b> <b>tern</b> does not use its normal plunge-dive technique, but instead uses short shallow dives so that they are {{concealed}} from their prey. The <b>royal</b> <b>tern</b> also uses this technique when hunting flying fish.|$|E

More than 95 % of all prey taken by these terns were roundfish, ranging in weight from 0. 3 to 40 g. Birds usually fed alone, but {{sometimes}} they were observed feeding in mixed-species flocks consisting of 15 - 200 individuals. Capture rate (n fish per hour foraging) in these flocks was higher than that of solitary birds. However, smaller fish were caught by birds foraging in flocks, so food intake rate (g/h) did not differ between solitary and flock-feeding birds. The relationships between foraging behaviour of the three tern species and abiotic factors, such as time, tide and water clarity, have been investigated. Capture rate of <b>Royal</b> <b>Terns</b> increased with water clarity. For Little Terns and Sandwich Terns, food intake rate was lower in the most turbid waters compared to clearer waters. There was very little foraging activity during high tide. For Little <b>Terns</b> and <b>Royal</b> <b>Terns,</b> food intake rate was about twice as high during receding and low tides as during an incoming tide. Food intake rate averaged 8 g/h in Little Terns, 60 g/h in Sandwich Terns and 45 g/h in <b>Royal</b> <b>Terns.</b> With a rough model, we estimate the maximum rate of daily energy expenditure of terns wintering in the tropics at 3 x BMR (defined as energy expenditure of inactive bird at thermoneutrality in a post-absorptive state during the resting phase of the daily cycle).

The <b>royal</b> <b>tern</b> feeds in salt water and on very rare occasions in fresh water. When feeding they fly long distances from the colony to forage. The <b>royal</b> <b>tern</b> feeds by diving into the water from heights near 30 ft.

40|$|Abstract Background Terns (Charadriiformes: Sterninae) are a {{lineage of}} {{cosmopolitan}} shorebirds with a disputed evolutionary history that comprises {{several species of}} conservation concern. As a non-model system in genetics, previous study has left most of the nuclear genome unexplored, and population-level studies are limited to only 15 % of the world's species of terns and noddies. Screening of polymorphic nuclear sequence markers is needed to enhance genetic resolution because of supposed low mitochondrial mutation rate, documentation of nuclear insertion of hypervariable mitochondrial regions, and limited success of microsatellite enrichment in terns. Here, we investigated the phylogenetic and population genetic utility for terns and relatives {{of a variety of}} nuclear markers previously developed for other birds and spanning the nuclear genome. Markers displaying a variety of mutation rates from both the nuclear and mitochondrial genome were tested and prioritized according to optimal cross-species amplification and extent of genetic polymorphism between (1) the main tern clades and (2) individual <b>Royal</b> <b>Terns</b> (Thalasseus maxima) breeding on the US East Coast. Results Results from this genome skimming effort yielded four new nuclear sequence-based markers for tern phylogenetics and 11 intra-specific polymorphic markers. Further, comparison between the two genomes indicated a phylogenetic conflict at the base of terns, involving the inclusion (mitochondrial) or exclusion (nuclear) of the Angel Tern (Gygis alba). Although limited mitochondrial variation was confirmed, both nuclear markers and a short tandem repeat in the mitochondrial control region indicated the presence of considerable genetic variation in <b>Royal</b> <b>Terns</b> at a regional scale. Conclusions These data document the value of intronic markers to the study of terns and allies. We expect that these and additional markers attained through next-generation sequencing methods will accurately map the genetic origin and species history of this group of birds. </p...|$|R

40|$|After {{hatching}} {{of their}} young many birds either cat eggshells or remove them from the nest. This and other nest sanitation behavior,such as defecation flights from the nest and the ingestion or disposal of nestling excrement, arc found among a variety of birds (Blair and Tucker, 1941; Nethersole-Thompsona nd Nethersole-Thompson, 1942). With some exceptions, e. g., Kittiwakcs (Rissa tridactyla; Cullen, 1957), Sandwich Terns (Sterna sandvicensis; Cullen, 1960; Crozc, 1970), <b>Royal</b> <b>Terns</b> (S. m. maxima; Bucklcy and Bucklcy, 1972), most Laridae tend to remove eggshells from their nests. Tinbergen et al. (1962) concluded that in Black-headed Gulls (Larus ridibundus) eggshell disposal represents a behavioral component of camouflage, i. e., removing conspicuous objects(white shell membranes) that might attract avian predators to the nest.
