30|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{magnitude}} of the effect of DSSW we use the estimation results presented in columns 2 a and 2 b of Table  5 and imagine a counterfactual scenario where partial pensions are subject to the application of <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficients</b> in case the worker partially retires before reaching the age of 65. With this hypothetical policy design we are eliminating one of the major appeals of partial retirement legislation. We provide in Table  6 the marginal effects that DSSW has on transition intensities at each duration. We again evaluate the marginal effects at every observation and use the sample average of the individual marginal effects. We measure the marginal effect by the decrease that DSSW is going to suffer if <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficients</b> also affect pensions stemming from partial retirement before reaching the ordinary age of retirement. Table  14 in Appendix presents descriptive statistics for this relevant difference in DSSW. As we want to evaluate these effects not only in absolute but also in relative terms, we include the percentage of change that transition intensities will experiment at each age as a result of reducing DSSW. As it can be seen in Table  6, the decreasing in the transition intensities to partial retirement are quite substantial. The main effect is observed at the age of 60, the first time partial retirement is allowed and the age when the application of <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficients</b> is more severe. At this age, the probability to partially retire would be reduced by 50 % or more if partial pensions were penalized. Thus, the non-applicability of <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficients</b> in case of partial retirement before the ordinary age of retirement {{is one of the main}} determinants of the use of this figure.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, we {{find that}} partial {{retirement}} legislation affects the choice {{between the use of}} partial and full retirement as alternative forms of accessing old-age pensions. We also find that there is variation across risks in the impact of an incentive variable measuring how much partial retirement beats full retirement in terms of social security wealth. Our results support {{the idea that there is}} scope for policy intervention to affect individual retirement decisions. The selection of retirement routes by the elderly will be influenced if partial retirement is favoured to the detriment of full retirement. In particular, the non-applicability of <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficients</b> in case of partial retirement is one of the main determinants of the use of this figure. In fact, we estimate that the probability to partially retire at the age of 60 would be reduced by 50 % or more if partial pensions were penalized through <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficients.</b>|$|E

30|$|Full retirement. An {{individual}} can fully retire through three different paths: ordinary retirement, early retirement and special retirement {{at the age}} of 64. The ordinary retirement age is 65. For those who started contributing to the system after 1967 and since the 2002 amendment, early retirement at age 61 is permitted with strict requirements. Namely, they have to (a) certify a minimum effective contribution period of 30  years, (b) be registered as a job seeker, in the public employment service offices, during a period of 6  months immediately prior to the date of the retirement application and (c) the job termination should not been caused by worker’s free will. Early retirement at age 60 is permitted (if the minimum period of contributions is satisfied), according to the rules of a transient law, for those who contributed to labour mutual funds that preceded the establishment of the social security system. The amount of all early retirement pensions are subject to <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Finally, retirement at 64  years, certifying the minimum period of contributions, is possible if the firm hires another worker for a minimum period of 1  year to replace the retiree.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach to}} calculating the space {{charge for the}} traveling-wave tube (TWT) with phase velocity jumps {{is to use the}} same values of the depression coefficient as the ones for homogeneous helical TWTs. However, if the variable component of the exciting current in the expressions for determining the <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> is changed in amplitude, then the reduction factor is a complex value. Perhaps the neglect of this fact can significantly affect the volume discharge calculated value, and hence the non-synchronization parameter, for those of its values, which are characteristic of the TWT with a phase velocity jump. In this paper, formulas has been obtained for computation of real and imaginary parts of the complex <b>reduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> for a cylindrical electrons beam with exponential variable amplitude of variable current component in the TWT.
