40|$|Being {{the core}} issue of {{international}} investment, {{the standards are}} confirmed to distinguish indirect expropriation from general <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> <b>implemented</b> by the host country. However, the standards have not been regulated definitely by International Investment Treaties. In the name of general regulatory measures, some of the host countries refuse to compensate for foreign investors by indirect expropriation. This paper first summarizes the standards of indirect expropriation, and then makes a deeply analysis on them, after which comes up {{with the assumption that}} the standards of indirect expropriation should take the standard of Effect and Purpose Test into account...|$|R

An article in the New England Journal on Criminal & Civil Confinement also suggested that there {{is the potential for}} the unconstitutional ex post facto application of law after circuit splits are resolved. Additionally, Jesse M. Boodoo argues that federal agencies tasked with enforcing laws throughout the United States may face challenges <b>implementing</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> when federal legislation is interpreted differently in separate circuits.|$|R
40|$|Different {{time series}} {{analysis}} of yearly air pollution at Al-Hashimeya Town, central of Jordan, has been performed in this study. Descriptive analysis showed different long-term variation of yearly air pollution. High persistence in yearly air pollution time series were identified using autocorrelation function. Autoregressive, integrated, and moving average (ARIMA) models were also calculated to predict future values of time series variable [...] It was found that {{time series analysis}} of Al-Hashimeya yearly air pollution data for the period 1992 – 2004 showed an overall decreasing trend in ambient air pollutants NO 2, CO, H 2 S, NO and TSP.

Another member of the government panel, Seiji Shiroya was paid 3.1 million yen by Japan Atomic Industrial Forum Inc. over three years to 2009, while he was professor at the University of Kyoto. According to Madarame, a former professor of the University of Tokyo, these donations had no influence on their decision-making, when they were promoting nuclear safety by double-checking the <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> <b>implemented</b> by the nuclear industry and science ministries. According to the two scientists, the donations were intended to promote nuclear research, and the money was spent on research and {{to cover the costs}} of business trips. Madarame added that all records of the panel-meetings were made published, and the public should judge whether these donations were appropriate.|$|R
40|$|Due {{to limited}} space, {{reducing}} the waste going to landfills {{has become a}} pressing issue in Hong Kong. As most of the solid waste was generated from construction activity, the Hong Kong government has instituted a number of measures aimed at reducing waste from this source. However, {{it appears that the}} application of these measures has been of limited effectiveness. This paper examines the effectiveness of <b>implementing</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> for reducing construction waste in Hong Kong. The data used for the analysis are from a survey to construction professionals in the local industry by means of questionnaire, interview discussions and case studies. The survey examined the commitments and responsibilities imposed on project participants for implementing waste management. The results of the investigation illustrate that legal commitments have been mainly allocated to contractors. Insufficient commitments and responsibilities are allocated to other project participants such as project clients, designers and consultants. The results demonstrate that there is need for a balanced allocation of responsibilities and commitments among all project stakeholders.

40|$|The {{commercial}} {{bottom trawl}} fishery for Pacific ocean shrimp, Pandalus jordani, or pink shrimp, operates mostly off {{the west coast}} of the contiguous United States. The California portion of the fishery has not been thoroughly documented or reviewed since the 1991 fishing season, despite its fluctuating more during the last 16 years (1992 – 2007) than at any other period in its 56 -year history. We used fishery-dependent data, California Department of Fish and Game commercial landing receipts and logbook data, to analyze trends and review the California pink shrimp trawl fishery from 1992 to 2007. In particular, we focus on the most recent years of the fishery (2001 – 07) to highlight the gear developments and key management <b>measures</b> <b>implemented</b> in the fishery. The fishery is primarily driven by market conditions and is highly regulated by both state and Federal management agencies. Several key <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> <b>implemented</b> during this decade have had significant effects on the fishery. For example, the requirement of a Bycatch Reduction Device on trawl nets targeting pink shrimp was approved in 2001 and has greatly reduced levels of finfish bycatch. Fishery production has declined, particularly in recent years, and may be attributed to decreased market prices, followed by reduced fishermen participation; both of which are related to changes in the processing sector and demand for the product...|$|R
40|$|Intense {{concern about}} obesity {{in the public}} {{imagination}} and in political, academic and media discourses has catalysed advocacy efforts to <b>implement</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> to reduce the occurrence of obesity in Australia and elsewhere. This article explores public attitudes towards the possible implementation of regulations to address obesity by analysing emotions within popular discourses. Drawing on reader comments attached to obesity-relevant news articles published on Australian news and current affairs websites, we examine how popular anxieties about the ‘obesity crisis’ and vitriol directed at obese individuals circulate alongside understandings of the appropriate role of government to legitimise regulatory reform to address obesity. Employing Ahmed's theorisation of ‘affective economies’ and broader literature on emotional cultures, we argue that obesity regulations achieve popular support within affective economies oriented to neoliberal and individualist constructions of obesity. These economies preclude constructions of obesity as a structural problem in popular discourse; instead positioning anti-obesity regulations as a government-endorsed vehicle for discrimination directed at obese people. Findings implicate {{a new set of}} ethical challenges for those championing regulatory reform for obesity prevention. Lucy C. Farrell, Megan J. Warin, Vivienne M. Moore, and Jackie M. Stree...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the interpretation and level of support of government regulations in Bahía de Kino, Sonora, {{one of the most}} important fishing communities in terms of diving extraction of benthic resources in the Northern Gulf of California. Research was conducted from April to August 2007, focusing on the small-scale fisheries sector of commercial divers. Information on fishers' awareness of current policies, fishers' attitudes concerning different aspects of fisheries regulation, and fishers' suggestions on how their fisheries should be managed, was gathered through structured interviews (including open and closed-ended questions), informal talks and participant observation. Results provide further evidence supporting the need for formally recognizing the fishers as key stakeholders in local fisheries, and for working cooperatively towards the design of management strategies and regulations that provide better stimulus for resource stewardship and discourage overfishing. Very importantly, this study suggests that there is strong support from resource users for <b>implementing</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> for local fisheries. Results could be used as a preliminary baseline to initiate the discussion among fishery stakeholders towards the development of species-specific management plans for the area, as required by the recently enacted fisheries act in Mexico, the "Ley General de Pesca y Acuacultura Sustentables".

40|$|International audienceSea {{cucumbers}} (Echinodermata: Holothuroidea) {{are large}} and abundant members of marine benthic communities. Overexploitation worldwide has raised concern because they have important functions within ecosystems. The ecological roles of commercially exploited sea cucumbers (Aspidochirotida and Dendrochirotida) are reviewed here, focusing on recent literature. Of the more than 70 species commercially exploited, at least 12 regularly bury into sand and mud, playing major roles in bioturbation. Most aspidochirotids are deposit-feeders, reducing the organic load and redistributing surface sediments, making them bioremediators for coastal mariculture. Sea cucumbers excrete inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, enhancing the productivity of benthic biota. This form of nutrient recycling is crucial in ecosystems in oligotrophic waters such as coral reefs. Feeding and excretion by sea cucumbers also act to increase seawater alkalinity which contributes to local buffering of ocean acidification. Sea cucumbers host more than 200 species of parasitic and commensal symbionts from seven phyla, thereby enhancing ecosystem biodiversity. They are preyed on by many taxa, thereby transferring animal tissue and nutrients (derived from detritus and microalgae) to higher trophic levels. Overexploitation of sea cucumbers is likely to decrease sediment health, reduce nutrient recycling and potential benefits of deposit-feeding to seawater chemistry, diminish biodiversity of associated symbionts, and reduce the transfer of organic matter from detritus to higher trophic levels. Ecosystem-based fisheries management needs to consider the importance of sea cucumbers in marine ecosystems and <b>implement</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> to safeguard their ecological roles...|$|R

40|$|Air {{dispersion}} software {{models for}} evaluating pesticide spray drift during application {{have been developed}} that can potentially serve as a cheaper convenient alternative to field monitoring campaigns. Such models require validation against field monitoring data {{in order for them}} to be employed with confidence, especially when they are used to <b>implement</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> or to evaluate potential human exposure levels. In this case study, off‐target pesticide drift was monitored during ground application of a pesticide mixture to a sorghum field in South Africa. Atrazine was used as a drift tracer. High volume air sampling onto polyurethane foam (PUF) was conducted at six downwind locations and at four heights at each sampling point. Additional data, including meteorological information, required to simulate the spray drift with the AGDISP® air dispersion model was collected. The PUF plugs were extracted by a plunger method utilising a hexane:acetone mixture with analysis by GC‐NPD (94. 5 % recovery, 3. 3 % RSD, and LOD 8. 7 pg). Atrazine concentrations ranged from 4. 55 ng L‐ 1 adjacent to the field to 186 pg L‐ 1 at 400 m downwind. These results compared favourably with modeled output data, resulting in the validation of the model up to 400 m from the application site for the first time. Sensitivity studies showed the importance of droplet size distribution on spray drift, which highlighted the need for good nozzle maintenance. Results of this case study indicate that the model may provide meaningful input into environmental and human health risk assessment studies in South Africa and other developing countries.

40|$|Fusarium oxysporum formae specialis cubense (Foc) is a soil-borne fungus {{that causes}} Fusarium wilt, which is {{considered}} to be the most destructive disease of bananas. The fungus is believed to have evolved with its host in the Indo-Malayan region, and from there it was spread to other banana-growing areas with infected planting material. The diversity and distribution of Foc in Asia was investigated. A total of 594 F. oxysporum isolates collected in ten Asian countries were identified by vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) analysis. To simplify the identification process, the isolates were first divided into DNA lineages using PCR-RFLP analysis. Six lineages and 14 VCGs, representing three Foc races, were identified in this study. The VCG complex 0124 / 5 was most common in the Indian subcontinent, Vietnam and Cambodia; whereas the VCG complex 01213 / 16 dominated in the rest of Asia. Sixty-nine F. oxysporum isolates in this study did not match any of the known VCG tester strains. In this study, Foc VCG diversity in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Sri Lanka was determined {{for the first time and}} VCGs 01221 and 01222 were first reported from Cambodia and Vietnam. New associations of Foc VCGs and banana cultivars were recorded in all the countries where the fungus was collected. Information obtained in this study could help Asian countries to develop and <b>implement</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> to prevent the incursion of Foc into areas where it does not yet occur. It could also facilitate the deployment of disease resistant banana varieties in infested areas. Peer Revie...|$|R
