25|$|This design {{characteristic}} of the <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactor</b> is generally seen as one of several causes of the Chernobyl disaster.|$|E
25|$|There are 1693 fuel {{channels}} and 170 control rod channels {{in the first}} generation <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactor</b> cores. Second generation reactor cores (such as Chernobyl-4) have 1661 fuel {{channels and}} 211 control rod channels.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactor</b> design used at Chernobyl, {{which uses}} {{graphite}} instead of water as the moderator and uses boiling water as the coolant, {{has a large}} positive thermal coefficient of reactivity, that increases heat generation when coolant water temperatures increase. This makes the RBMK design less stable than pressurized water reactors. In addition to its property of slowing down neutrons when serving as a moderator, water also has a property of absorbing neutrons, albeit to a lesser degree. When the coolant water temperature increases, the boiling increases, which creates voids. Thus there is less water to absorb thermal neutrons {{that have already been}} slowed down by the graphite moderator, causing an increase in reactivity. This property is called the void coefficient of reactivity, and in an <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactor</b> like Chernobyl, the void coefficient is positive, and fairly large, causing rapid transients.|$|E
40|$|The safety {{basis for}} <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> follows {{generally}} used safety principles of “defence in depth”. In-service inspection has revealed widespread intergranular {{stress corrosion cracking}} in the safety related austenitic piping of the main circulation circuit in <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors.</b> IGSCC in the safety related main circulation circuit piping of <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> increases the probability of core damage due to pipe break. Therefore, IGSCC in <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> is an important safety issue. Operators of BWR reactors in western countries experienced a similar problem starting in the late 1970 ’s. As a consequence, successful strategies for managing IGSCC degradation in BWR reactors were developed. Design differences between BWR and <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> preclude the use of BWR strategies without adapting the technology to the RBMK case. Recognising {{the importance of this}} issue the IAEA organised a Workshop on “Environmental Assisted Cracking of NPP Austenitic Stainless Steel Piping ” [1] and subsequently an experts’ meeting on this issue specifically for <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> [2] in 1998. Experts who participated concluded that a comprehensive programme is needed to address the issues of IGSCC in all <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors.</b> The experts meeting in October 1998 developed project outlines for seven technical areas that were felt necessary to address IGSCC in <b>RBMK</b> designed <b>reactors.</b> To coordinate the efforts of these projects the IAEA convened the first meeting of the most general and broadest scope group, the Safety Assessment Group with the objective to advise on the overall programme planning, co-ordination and prioritisation. 2. Programme Description The seven projects needed to mitigate the impact of IGSCC on safe operation of <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> were identified in October 1998 [2] as...|$|R
50|$|Legasov's suicide caused shockwaves in the Soviet nuclear industry. In particular, {{the problem}} with the design of the control rods in Chernobyl-type <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> was rapidly {{admitted}} and changed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>RBMK</b> <b>{{reactors}},</b> such as {{the reactors}} at Chernobyl, have a dangerously high positive void coefficient. This allowed the reactor to run on unenriched uranium and to require no heavy water, saving costs (also, unlike the other main power design, VVER, RBMKs were dual use, able to produce weapons-grade plutonium). Before the Chernobyl accident these reactors had a positive void coefficient of 4.7 beta and after the accident that was lowered to 0.7 beta. This was done so all <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> could resume safe operation and produce much needed power for the then USSR and its satellites.|$|R
25|$|In his posthumously {{published}} memoirs, Valeri Legasov, the First Deputy Director of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, {{revealed that}} the Institute's scientists had long known that the <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactor</b> had significant design flaws. Legasov's death from suicide, apparently {{as a result of}} becoming bitterly disillusioned with the failure of the authorities to confront the flaws, caused shockwaves throughout the Soviet nuclear industry and the problems with the RBMK design were rapidly accepted.|$|E
25|$|<b>RBMK</b> <b>reactor</b> fuel {{was used}} in Soviet-designed and built RBMK-type reactors. This is a low-enriched uranium oxide fuel. The fuel {{elements}} in an RBMK are 3 m long each, and two of these sit back-to-back on each fuel channel, pressure tube. Reprocessed uranium from Russian VVER reactor spent fuel is used to fabricate RBMK fuel. Following the Chernobyl accident, the enrichment of fuel was changed from 2.0% to 2.4%, to compensate for control rod modifications {{and the introduction of}} additional absorbers.|$|E
25|$|The RBMK is {{an early}} Generation II reactor and the oldest {{commercial}} reactor design still in wide operation. Certain aspects of the <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactor</b> design, such as the active removal of decay heat, the positive void coefficient properties, the graphite-tipped control rods and instability at low power levels, contributed to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, in which an RBMK exploded during a mishandled test, and radioactivity was released over {{a large portion of}} Europe. The disaster prompted worldwide calls for the reactors to be completely decommissioned; however, there is still considerable reliance on RBMK facilities for power in Russia. The imperfections in the design of RBMK-1000 reactors were eliminated soon after the Chernobyl accident, and {{for more than twenty years}} a dozen of RBMK reactors have been operating without catastrophic accidents. While nine RBMK blocks under construction were cancelled after the Chernobyl disaster, and the last of three remaining RBMK blocks at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant was finally shut down in 2000, as of 2013 there were still 11 RBMK reactors operating in Russia– though all 11 have been retrofitted with a number of safety updates.|$|E
50|$|Although some {{buildings}} containing {{nuclear reactors}} are containment buildings, not all are. For instance, the Soviet <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> were not housed in containment buildings. This greatly increased {{the severity of}} the Chernobyl accident on April 26, 1986.|$|R
5000|$|The single reactor {{unit at the}} plant, AM-1 ("", Atom Mirny, Russian for [...] "Atoms for Peace"), had a total {{electrical}} capacity of 6 MW and a net capacity of around 5 MWe. Thermal output was 30 MW. It was a prototype design using a graphite moderator and water coolant. This reactor was a forerunner of the <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors.</b>|$|R
25|$|A Soviet design, {{built to}} produce {{plutonium}} {{as well as}} power. RBMKs are water cooled with a graphite moderator. RBMKs are in some respects similar to CANDU {{in that they are}} refuelable during power operation and employ a pressure tube design instead of a PWR-style pressure vessel. However, unlike CANDU they are very unstable and large, making containment buildings for them expensive. A series of critical safety flaws have also been identified with the RBMK design, though some of these were corrected following the Chernobyl disaster. Their main attraction is their use of light water and un-enriched uranium. As of 2010, 11 remain open, mostly due to safety improvements and help from international safety agencies such as the DOE. Despite these safety improvements, <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> are still {{considered one of the most}} dangerous reactor designs in use. <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> were deployed only in the former Soviet Union.|$|R

2500|$|The RBMK {{design was}} built {{primarily}} to be powerful, quick {{to build and}} easy to maintain. Full physical containment structures for each reactor would {{have more than doubled}} the cost and construction time of each plant, and since the design had been certified by the Soviet nuclear science ministry as inherently safe when operated within established parameters the Soviet authorities assumed proper adherence to doctrine by workers would make any accident impossible. Additionally, RBMK reactors were designed to allow fuel rods to be changed without shutting down (as in the pressurized heavy water CANDU reactor), both for refueling and for plutonium production (for nuclear weapons). This required large cranes above the core. As the <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactor</b> is very tall (about [...] ), the cost and difficulty of building a heavy containment structure prevented the building of additional emergency containment structures for pipes on top of the reactor. In the Chernobyl accident, the pressure rose to levels high enough to blow the top off the reactor, breaking open the fuel channels in the process and starting a massive fire when air contacted the superheated graphite core. After the Chernobyl accident, some RBMK reactors were retrofitted with a partial containment structure (in lieu of a full containment building), which surround the fuel channels with water jackets in order to capture any radioactive particles released.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{reactors}} {{need to be}} {{shut down}} for refueling; for example, pebble bed <b>reactors,</b> <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors,</b> molten salt reactors, Magnox, AGR and CANDU reactors allow fuel to be shifted through the reactor while it is running. In a CANDU reactor, this also allows individual fuel elements to be situated within the reactor core that are best suited to the amount of U-235 in the fuel element.|$|R
5000|$|According to Lev Kotchetkov, who {{was there}} at the time: [...] "Although {{utilisation}} of generated heat was going on, and production of isotopes was even enhanced, the main task was to carry out experimental studies on 17 test loops installed in the reactor." [...] The technology perfected in the Obninsk pilot plant was later employed on a much larger scale in the <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors.</b>|$|R

All of the reactors there have been shut down, leaving only the much safer VVER reactors operating in the country.

50|$|The EGP-6 {{reactors}} are a scaled down {{version of}} the <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactor</b> design. Notably, these reactors along with the RBMK designs {{are some of the}} few active reactors which still use ordinary (light) water cooled graphite as a neutron moderator.|$|E
50|$|In Lithuania in 1978, {{construction}} {{began on}} two <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> (1,380 MWe net) with 30-year {{lives for the}} Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. The light-water, graphite-moderated reactors were of similar design as those at Chernobyl. The nuclear power plant began operating in 1983. The first reactor was decommissioned in 2004 and the second one in 2009. Originally, Lithuania built these reactors to export electricity to its neighbours, with 42% of electricity exported in 1989. This number fell through the 1990s as domestic demand increased.|$|R
25|$|By using {{a minimalist}} design that used regular (light) water for cooling and {{graphite}} for moderation, {{it was possible}} to use natural uranium for fuel (instead of the considerably more expensive enriched uranium). This allowed for an extraordinarily large and powerful reactor that was also cheap enough to be built in large numbers and simple enough to be maintained and operated by local personnel. For example, the <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in Lithuania were rated at 1500MWe each, a very large size for the time and even for today.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike the Three Mile Island {{accident}}, {{the much}} more serious Chernobyl accident did not increase regulations affecting Western reactors since the Chernobyl reactors were of the problematic RBMK design only used in the Soviet Union, for example lacking [...] "robust" [...] containment buildings. Many of these <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> are still in use today. However, changes were made in both the reactors themselves (use of a safer enrichment of uranium) and in the control system (prevention of disabling safety systems), amongst other things, to reduce {{the possibility of a}} duplicate accident.|$|R
50|$|Soviet-designed RBMKs, {{found only}} in Russia and the CIS and now shut down {{everywhere}} except Russia, do not have containment buildings, are naturally unstable (tending to dangerous power fluctuations), and also have ECCS systems that are considered grossly inadequate by Western safety standards.

50|$|In {{steady state}} operation, a {{significant}} fraction (over 6%) {{of the power}} from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products. This heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped (e.g., following an emergency SCRAM) and active cooling {{may be required to}} prevent core damage. <b>RBMK</b> <b>reactors</b> like those at Chernobyl use water as a coolant. Reactor 4 at Chernobyl consisted of about 1,600 individual fuel channels; each required a coolant flow of 28 metric tons (28000 L) per hour.|$|R
