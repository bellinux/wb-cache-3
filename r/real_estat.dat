40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the importance of creating a learning culture for strategic partnering in construction. Theories of organizational learning and strategic partnering are interpolated to identify the related attributes that help to relate and intertwine the two concepts. With the emergence of a learning culture, organizations are able to undergo the transition from no organizational learning to integrated organizationallearning, which in turn reinforces the embedded culture. Since learning from experience, continuous improvement and a learning climate are pre‐conditions for a learning culture, three models are presented respectively in dealing with issues relating to these conditions. These models help to attain strategicpartnering. Department of Building and <b>Real</b> <b>Estat...</b>|$|E

40|$|The single project {{paradigm}} which {{dominates the}} literature of both project and construction management research does not accurately reflect the reality of many construction clients, who have large ongoing construction portfolios rather than one-off construction projects. Although several concepts of multi-project environments (MPEs) exist, {{an investigation of the}} form and dynamic interactions of components within MPEs of construction clients was lacking. This paper presents the factors identified as exerting greatest influence on project delivery within construction clients' MPEs. Department of Building and <b>Real</b> <b>Estat...</b>|$|E
40|$|Wide {{acceptance}} {{of the concept of}} sustainable development has led to a demand for policies on sustainable housing. The issues of how sustainable housing can be measured or evaluated and how decision-making regarding sustainable housing can be facilitated are areas that require further research. This paper aims to introduce a conceptual approach in developing a decision-support tool for sustainable housing. An empirical decision-support model for sustainable housing indicators using fuzzy-set theory (SHIFT) is described, with particular focus on framing decision-making for multiple criteria or objectives.

40|$|Property {{developers}} have increasingly used forward contracts to pre-sell uncompleted properties {{to enhance their}} financial viability. However, there are limited researchers exploring the hidden forward risks arising from asymmetric information issues embedded in forward property markets. This study sets up a Forward-Spot Property Index-Tracking (FSIT) model, which is able to capture not only the risks arising from market uncertainty during the construction time-lag and the discount required {{to compensate for the}} missing rents within the forward contract period, but also the risk premium imposed on a purchase of a presale property arising from asymmetric information issues.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{valuation}} accuracy only deal with investment properties. This study examines empirically {{the accuracy of}} the valuations produced by appraisers in a particular situation: the auctioning of vacant land by the Hong Kong government. Using regression analysis, this study finds that private sector appraisers perform better than public sector appraisers. Among the private sector appraisers, the variation in estimation of values relative to the transaction price falls outside a 20 % band, 70 % of the time, due to the high volatility of the market during the sample period.

40|$|One {{major reason}} that hinders the {{implementation}} of process improvement principles {{in the construction industry}} is the lack of a powerful formalism to model and analyze the existing and new workflow processes. This paper proposes a framework which is based on the use of Petri nets for modeling and analyzing workflow processes in construction. The paper starts with an overview of current developments in the Petri nets theory. The paper then presents an example to demonstrate how to use the Petri net based framework to assist important steps of process improvement. Department of Building and <b>Real</b> <b>Estat...</b>|$|E

40|$|In practice, it {{is common}} that several members {{collaborate}} to prepare a document. For example, {{in the domain of}} construction, it is necessary to collaborate with others to prepare investment proposals, feasibility analysis reports, etc [...] But little software for document preparation can support this process well up to now. Accordingly, the paper proposes a solution for developing a general purpose collaborative system for document preparation based on network and commonly used word processing software. A prototype system has been implemented. It provides a new approach to developing a collaborative system for document preparation. Department of Building and <b>Real</b> <b>Estat...</b>|$|E
