This weapon lacks a counter-recoil brake, as the force of the counter-recoil is checked by <b>recoil</b> from the firing of the next round of ammunition.|$|E
40|$|The {{ionization}} yield in the two-phase liquid xenon dark-matter detector {{has been}} studied in keV nuclear-recoil energy region. The newly-obtained nuclear quenching {{as well as the}} recently-measured average energy required to produce an electron-ion pair are used to calculate the total electric charges produced. To estimate the fraction of the electron charges collected, the Thomas-Imel model is generalized to describing the field dependence for nuclear <b>recoils</b> in liquid xenon. With free parameters fitted to experiment measured 56. 5 keV nuclear <b>recoils,</b> the energy dependence of ionization yield for nuclear <b>recoils</b> is predicted, which increases with the decreasing of the <b>recoiling</b> energy and reaches the maximum value at 2 ~ 3 keV. This prediction agrees well with existing data and may help to lower the energy detection threshold for nuclear <b>recoils</b> to ~ 1 keV. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|We analyze Einstein's <b>recoiling</b> slit {{experiment}} {{and point out}} that the inevitable entanglement between the particle and the <b>recoiling</b> slit was not part of Bohr's reply. We show that if this entanglement is taken into account, one can provide a simpler answer to Einstein. We also derive the Englert-Greenberger-Yasin duality relation from the entanglement between the particle and the <b>recoiling</b> slit. In addition, we show that the Englert-Greenberger-Yasin duality relation can also {{be thought of as a}} consequence of the sum uncertainty relation for certain observables of the <b>recoiling</b> slit. Thus, the uncertainty relations and entanglement are both an integral part of the which-way detection process. Quanta 2013; 2 : 58 – 65...|$|R

5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its <b>recoil</b> and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing <b>recoil</b> through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} electron-ion recombination processes in ionization tracks of <b>recoiled</b> atoms in liquid argon (LAr) detectors. The analysis {{is based on the}} results of computer simulations which use realistic models of electron transport and reactions. The calculations reproduce the recent experimental results of the ionization yield from 6. 7 keV nuclear <b>recoils</b> in LAr. The statistical distribution of the number of electrons that escape recombination is found to deviate from the binomial distribution, and estimates of recombination fluctuations for nuclear <b>recoils</b> tracks are obtained. A study of the recombination kinetics shows that a significant part of electrons undergo very fast static recombination, an effect that may be responsible for the weak drift-field dependence of the ionization yield from nuclear <b>recoils</b> in some noble liquids. The obtained results can be useful in the search for hypothetical dark matter particles and in other studies that involve detection of <b>recoiled</b> nuclei...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{relativity}} simulations {{predict that}} coalescence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries not only {{leads to a}} spin flip but also to a <b>recoiling</b> of the merger remnant SMBHs. In the literature, X-shaped radio sources are popularly suggested to be candidates for SMBH mergers with spin flip of jet-ejecting SMBHs. Here we investigate the spectral and spatial observational signatures of the <b>recoiling</b> SMBHs in radio sources undergoing black hole spin flip. Our results show that SMBHs in most spin-flip radio sources have mass ratio q 0. 3 with a minimum possible value q_ min≃ 0. 05. For major mergers, the remnant SMBHs can get a kick velocity as high as 2100 km s^- 1 in the direction within an angle 40 ^∘ relative to the spin axes of remnant SMBHs, implying that <b>recoiling</b> quasars are biased to be with high Doppler-shifted broad emission lines while <b>recoiling</b> radio galaxies are biased to large apparent spatial off-center displacements. We also calculate the distribution functions of line-of-sight velocity and apparent spatial off-center for spin-flip radio sources with different apparent jet reorientation angles. Our {{results show that the}} larger the apparent jet reorientation angle is, the larger the Doppler-shifting <b>recoiling</b> velocity and apparent spatial off-center displacement will be. We investigate the effects of <b>recoiling</b> velocity on the dust torus in spin-flip radio sources and suggest that <b>recoiling</b> of SMBHs would lead to "dust poor" AGNs. Finally, we collect a sample of 19 X-shaped radio objects and for each object give the probability of detecting the predicted signatures of <b>recoiling</b> SMBH.

Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of <b>recoil.</b> The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the <b>recoil</b> system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator.

40|$|Abstract The <b>recoils</b> of an {{accelerated}} system {{caused by the}} transitions characterizing thermal equilibrium {{are taken into account}} through the quantum character of the position of the system. The specific model is that of a two level ion accelerated by a constant electric field. The introduction of the wave function of the center of mass position clarifies the role of the classical trajectory in the thermalization process. Then the effects of the <b>recoils</b> on the properties of the emitted fluxes are analyzed. The decoherence of successive emissions induced by the <b>recoils</b> is manifest and simplifies the properties of the fluxes. The fundamental reason for which one cannot neglect the <b>recoils</b> upon considering accelerated systems is stressed and put in parallel with the emergence of ”transplanckian ” frequencies in Hawking radiation. ...|$|R
40|$|Scintillation {{efficiency}} of low-energy nuclear <b>recoils</b> in noble liquids plays {{a crucial role}} in interpreting results from some direct searches for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter. However, the cause of a reduced scintillation efficiency relative to electronic <b>recoils</b> in noble liquids remains unclear at the moment. We attribute such a reduction of scintillation efficiency to two major mechanisms: 1) energy loss and 2) scintillation quenching. The former is commonly described by Lindhard's theory and the latter by Birk's saturation law. We propose to combine these two to explain the observed reduction of scintillation yield for nuclear <b>recoils</b> in noble liquids. Birk's constants $kB$ for argon, neon and xenon determined from existing data are used to predict noble liquid scintillator's response to low-energy nuclear <b>recoils</b> and low-energy electrons. We find that energy loss due to nuclear stopping power that contributes little to ionization and excitation is the dominant reduction mechanism in scintillation efficiency for nuclear <b>recoils,</b> but that significant additional quenching results from the nonlinear response of scintillation to the ionization density.

5|$|While Seaborg {{applied for}} funding, Harvey {{worked on the}} {{einsteinium}} target, while Thomson and Choppin focused on methods for chemical isolation. Choppin suggested using α-hydroxyisobutyric acid to separate the mendelevium atoms {{from those of the}} lighter actinides. The actual synthesis was done by a <b>recoil</b> technique, introduced by Albert Ghiorso. In this technique, the einsteinium was placed {{on the opposite side of}} the target from the beam, so that the recoiling mendelevium atoms would get enough momentum to leave the target and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold. This <b>recoil</b> target was made by an electroplating technique, developed by Alfred Chetham-Strode. This technique gave a very high yield, which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the einsteinium target material. The <b>recoil</b> target consisted of 109 atoms of 253Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil. It was bombarded by 41MeV alpha particles in the Berkeley cyclotron with a very high beam density of 6×1013 particles per second over an area of 0.05cm2. The target was cooled by water or liquid helium, and the foil could be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Some {{minor changes}} in the gun {{construction}} were introduced during production. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on 29 January 1942). Although ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed. Another change was a threaded barrel end to accept a big five-port muzzle brake (gun M3A1, adopted on 5 March 1942). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust {{in front of the}} gun, which hindered aiming; however, the brake {{turned out to be a}} safety problem when firing canister ammunition and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without the muzzle brake. Other sources mention the muzzle brake was intended to soften a <b>recoil</b> and they say that it was dropped simply because additional <b>recoil</b> control measures were not really needed.|$|E

40|$|We have {{measured}} the scintillation and ionization yield of <b>recoiling</b> nuclei in liquid argon {{as a function}} of applied electric field by exposing a dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber (LAr-TPC) to a low energy pulsed narrow band neutron beam produced at the Notre Dame Institute for Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics. Liquid scintillation counters were arranged to detect and identify neutrons scattered in the TPC and to select the energy of the <b>recoiling</b> nuclei. We report measurements of the scintillation yields for nuclear <b>recoils</b> with energies from 10. 3 to 57. 3 Â keV and for median applied electric fields from 0 to 970 V/cm. For the ionization yields, we report measurements from 16. 9 to 57. 3 keV and for electric fields from 96. 4 to 486 V/cm. We also report the observation of an anticorrelation between scintillation and ionization from nuclear <b>recoils,</b> which is similar to the anticorrelation between scintillation and ionization from electron <b>recoils.</b> Assuming that the energy loss partitions into excitons and ion pairs from Kr 83 m internal conversion electrons is comparable to that from Bi 207 conversion electrons, we obtained the numbers of excitons (Nex) and ion pairs (Ni) and their ratio (Nex/Ni) produced by nuclear <b>recoils</b> from 16. 9 to 57. 3 keV. Motivated by arguments suggesting direction sensitivity in LAr-TPC signals due to columnar recombination, a comparison of the light and charge yield of <b>recoils</b> parallel and perpendicular to the applied electric field is presented for the first time. © 2015 American Physical Society...|$|R

5|$|Even before Monitor was commissioned, she ran an {{unsuccessful}} set of sea trials on 19 February. Valve {{problems with the}} main engine {{and one of the}} fan engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Greenpoint and she had to be towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and Monitor was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling the rudder had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of pulleys as he believed it would take less time. His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March. Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the <b>recoil</b> mechanism worked on Ericsson's carriage for the 11-inch guns. Instead of tightening them to reduce the <b>recoil</b> upon firing, he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret, fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns.|$|E
