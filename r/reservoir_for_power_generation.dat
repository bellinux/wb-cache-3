40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the idea of}} combining multi-fluid and multi-level geothermal systems with two reservoirs at depths of 3 and 5 km. In the base case, for comparison, the two reservoirs are operated independently, each as a multi-fluid (brine and carbon dioxide) reservoir that uses a number of horizontal, concentric injection and production well rings. When the shallow and the deep reservoirs are operated in an integrated fashion, in the shallow reservoir, power is produced only from the carbon dioxide (CO 2), while the brine is geothermally preheated in the shallow multi-fluid reservoir, produced, and then reinjected at the deeper reservoir’s brine injectors. The integrated reservoir scenarios are further subdivided into two cases: In one scenario, both brine (preheated in the shallow reservoir) and CO 2 (from the surface) are injected separately into the deeper reservoir’s appropriate injectors and both fluids are produced from their respective deep reservoir producers to generate electricity. In the other scenario, only preheated brine is injected into, and produced from, the deep <b>reservoir</b> <b>for</b> electric <b>power</b> <b>generation.</b> We find that integrated, vertically stacked, multi-fluid geothermal systems can result in improved system efficiency when power plant lifespans exceed ~ 30 years.

The article summarizes the ecological conditions of the Pantanal, discusses commercial and non-commercial values of the area, describes constraints for the development of intensive agriculture and cattle ranching, and discusses development alternatives. Considering the low density of human population inside the Pantanal, it can be concluded that development pressure on the Pantanal arises mostly from pressure groups outside the area that will also mostly benefit from the economic return of the development projects. Low density of human population would still allow the application of economically viable and environmentally friendly development alternatives that maintain and sustainably manage one of the largest wetlands in the world...|$|R

In addition to a 100 % water hyacinth arrangement, we tested arrangements with either eared watermoss or water lettuce at 75 : 25 %, 50 : 50 %, and 25 : 75 %, plus a triple density with the three species placed equally at a 33 % proportion. Dye solutions of FDC Yellow No. 5 at 3500 ppm and FDC Blue No. 1 at 1000 ppm were used as spraying tracers for TXVK- 8 and DG 11002 VS nozzles, respectively. Both solutions were sprayed on the same plot at 30 -min intervals through a CO(2) pressured backpack knapsack calibrated to deliver a spray volume around 200 L/ha. The TXVK- 8 tip provided greater spray mix deposition when compared to the DG 11002 VS tip, regardless of the plant proportions. For both spray tips, higher proportions of eared watermoss and the triple association among the plants provided the highest spray mix deposition on water hyacinth plants. The increase of spray mix deposition is likely related to the increase of eared watermoss or water lettuce as well as the decrease of water hyacinth plants in the association and consequent decreases of self covering among water hyacinth leaves. Lake managers should consider that improved herbicide uptake is possible through the choice of nozzle as well as applying herbicides to hyacinth before it forms dense monocultures or dense mixtures with other free-floating plants...|$|R

40|$|With an {{estimated}} 2, 500 to 3, 000 fish species, the Amazon basin {{is the largest}} biodiversity center of freshwater fishes. The large number {{is related to the}} size of the basin, a large habitat diversity, high speciation rates of different groups, and low extinction rates resulting from a rather stable tropical climate which has persisted over long geological periods. Amazonia is characterized by a very dense network of streams and rivers, connected to extended floodplains and wetland areas. There are only a few small permanently isolated deep lakes in the area. Rapids and waterfalls along the border of the Guyana shield, the Central Brazilian shield and the Andes separate the downstream and upstream fish faunas of major rivers. Estimates indicate that about half of the fish fauna colonizes the large river floodplain systems along the lower and middle reaches of the rivers and the other half the headwater streams. Knowledge about fish habitats is concentrated mostly on large river floodplains near large cities, which provide infrastructure for research, and habitat conditions in large areas are virtually unknown. Information is scattered in limnological, botanical, geographical, and aquarium literature. Ongoing research concentrates mostly on the inland fisheries. Large parts of the Amazon River basin are still in pristine condition as are the fish habitats. However, human activities, including the transformation of large savanna and rain forest areas into agricultural land, the construction of large <b>reservoirs</b> <b>for</b> hydroelectric <b>power</b> <b>generation,</b> and mining profoundly modify fish habitats, and threaten species diversity mainly in small streams. Environmental legislation for the protection of streamside vegetation is sometimes contradictory and often not respected by the landowners.

Even these areas suffer illegal human activities because of insufficient administration. There is an urgent need for the classification of fish habitats throughout the basin and the proposal of specific protection measure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Irtysh River is an {{international}} river partially joining the territories of China, Kazakhstan, and Russia. Cascade reservoirs have been constructed in {{the upper reaches of}} the river and their effects on the seasonal discharge of the middle and lower reaches were analyzed considering the mean and dispersion of the seasonal discharge. The Lepage test, which is a nonparametric, two-sample test for detecting location and dispersion, was used to measure the significance of difference between the pre-dam and post-dam seasonal discharge. The results show that the reservoirs' effects on the seasonal discharge varied with the season. In the middle reaches of the river, the summer and autumn discharge decreased significantly and their inter-annual variabilities also decreased significantly. The summer and autumn precipitation over the Irtysh River Basin changed little before and after the operation of the reservoir, which indicates that the discharge changes mainly due to water storage of the reservoirs. The reservoirs store water in summer and autumn and store more water in a wet year, which leads to the reduction of the mean and dispersion of the summer and autumn discharge. The winter discharge increased significantly because the <b>reservoirs</b> released water <b>for</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation.</b> The spring discharge changed slightly. In the lower reaches, only the winter discharge increased significantly, and the other seasonal discharge changed slightly.

40|$|The Northern Ethiopian Highlands are {{a fragile}} environment, characterised by steep slopes, intense {{rainfall}} and a sparse vegetation cover. The extreme poverty, stagnating technology and high population and livestock densities induce intense soil erosion and degradation problems in these Highlands. This not only leads to lower crop yields but has also important off-site consequences: {{the life expectancy}} of many <b>reservoirs</b> (used <b>for</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> or water supply in the dry season) is threatened by massive sedimentation. Although these problems demand for a thorough solution, {{little is known about}} the magnitude and dynamics of sediment transport in the Northern Ethiopian Highlands. Therefore, an intensive measuring campaign was conducted during the rainy season of 2006 in ten subcatchments of the Geba (drainage area: 5180 km²), a tributary of the Tekeze river. The catchments had drainage areas between 120 km² and 4330 km² (mean: 1068 km²) and represented a range of environments. Annual rainfall ranges from 700 mm to more then 1200 mm. The estimated area-specific sediment yields (SY) varied between 400 and 2500 ton/km²/yr (average: 1404 ton/km²/yr). These values were obtained with rating curves, based on manual runoff discharge and suspended sediment concentration measurements. The error on these yields was assessed by Monte Carlo simulations and varied between 6 and 48 %. In some cases, however, the uncertainty is larger, since our sampled population was not always fully representative for all events. A dominant part of the sediment is transported during short but intense flash floods at night. Sampling these events is very difficult and often even dangerous. A few flash floods were, however, monitored in detail. The results showed a clear positive hysteresis effect. To explain variation in SY between the catchments, a semi-quantitative model (FSM) was adapted. Topography, soil cover, lithology and the presence of gullies explained a large part of the observed variance (63 %). Insufficient information on soil and water conservation practices (SWCP) was available. Nevertheless our results strongly indicate that SWCP might be a relevant factor in explaining SY. Although further refinement is needed, semi-quantitative models are a promising tool for predicting SY in a cheap and efficient way when no detailed data is available. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Stretching {{more than}} seven million square kilometers, the Amazon River basin is the largest river basin {{in the world and}} {{discharges}} about one-sixth of all freshwater from the continents to the oceans of the world. The age of this ecosystem, its position near the equator and the enormous diversity of its aquatic habitats, have produced the most diverse fish fauna on the planet. About 2, 500 fish species have already been described and it is estimated that more than 1, 000 new species remain to be discovered. Knowledge concerning this multitude of fish species is still insufficient, which makes their management and protection difficult. About 50 % of the species are thought to occur in the large rivers and connected floodplains and another 50 % in headwater streams. Inland fisheries give rise to 450, 000 t of fish each year and thus contribute substantially to the protein supply of local populations. However, despite their economic importance, these fisheries receive little attention from the respective governments. The fisheries are highly selective and several stocks of large species with high market value have been over fished. Fish culture {{is still in its infancy}} but its development is expected to provide high-quality species during periods of low supply. Over large areas, aquatic habitats are still in near-natural conditions because of the low densities of resident human populations. Nonetheless, over the last few decades, the pressure on aquatic ecosystems and habitats has steadily increased, mainly due to large-scale destruction of natural vegetation cover by agro-industries in the savanna belt (cerrado), small-scale agriculture in the Andean hill slopes, and logging in rain forests. These activities have placed aquatic biodiversity, including fishes, at serious risk. Many headwater species have restricted distributions and are therefore particularly vulnerable to large-scale environmental degradation. Moreover, the construction of large <b>reservoirs</b> <b>for</b> hydroelectric <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> has serious consequences for fish fauna. Currently, about 16. 4 % of the Amazon River basin is protected, and another 15. 2 % is under partial protection in indigenous reserves in Brazil.

40|$|The Ili-Balkhash basin (IB basin) {{is a large}} {{freshwater}} system, covering 413 000 km 2 in Kazakhstan, China and Kyrgyzstan. The {{main part}} of the watershed is situated in Kazakstan (85 %) and a smaller part in northwestern China (15 %). The Kazakhstan's part of the IB basin embraces the territory of the Almaty region and Xinijang region. The water of the western lake Balkhash is slightly salty (1, 2 %), while the eastern part has a considerably higher salt contamination (3, 9 %). The lake has a surface area of over 16 000 km 2 and a length of 600 km. The average depth of the lake is six metres and its maximum depth reaches 26 metres. There are three main rivers flowing into the lake: Ili River, with a large delta, the Karatal River, with a smaller delta, and the Aqsu River. The biggest of them being the Ili river - already influenced by a reservoir created upstream and heavy agricultural use - which flows from China. Chinese authorities intend to make an increased use of the Ili river and thus China will come to have a strong influence on the Balkhash lake. The Xinijang region is highly populated and the population rate is increasing significantly through the combination of natural population increase and internal migration from the eastern part of China. The lake is very shallow and very sensitive to changes in water transport. Current development poses a severe threat to the watershed and specifically to lake Balkhash, since more and more water is diverted from the rivers for societal use, mainly agricultural irrigation. At the moment, the lake and the whole watershed suffer from ecological problems that mostly have been created artificially, by human hands. The Kapchagai reservoir, built along the middle reaches of the Ili River in 1966, and used for water storage since 1970, allowed the development of irrigation agriculture along the lower reaches of the river. The <b>reservoir</b> serves <b>for</b> hydroelectric <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> and <b>for</b> irrigation water supply. Since its inauguration, water use has increased along the lower reaches of the Ili River. In addition, increasing pollution emissions and an increased salinity of the lake water have seriously affected the fishing industry and diminished the surrounding habitats. So far, no action has been taken to reverse the ecological damage that the lake has suffered. In a worst scenario, a development similar to that for the Aral Sea can be foreseen. Future water management in the region will require improved water management policies, improved planning of water resources management, improved monitoring of different activities and their impact and an increased regional international cooperation, mainly between Kazakhstan and China. The Thesis is a compilation of information on the past and present situation of the IB basin, ending in a discussion of the sustainability of three future scenarios developed: (i) a business as usual scenario where {{there is a possibility that}} the lake will be divided into two separated small lakes, (ii) a non-conscious development with rapid economic growth scenario, where we risk the same ecological disaster as that happened to the Aral Sea and (iii) a sustainable development scenario, where the Balkhash lake can be saved. The discussion ends in the conclusion that there is a risk that a non-conscious development based on a rapid economic growth will result in severe long-term impacts and non-sustainable development in the IB basinwww. ima. kth. s...|$|R
