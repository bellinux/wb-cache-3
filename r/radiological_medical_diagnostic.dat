40|$|Abstract: The {{paper is}} a {{description}} of information and software content of a computer knowledge bank on <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> The classes of its users and the tasks which they can solve are described. The information content of the bank contains three ontologies: an ontology of observations {{in the field of}} <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostics,</b> an ontology of knowledge base (diseases) in <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostics</b> and an ontology of case records, and also it contains three classes of information resources for every division of medicine – observation bases, knowledge bases, and data bases (with data about patients), that correspond to these ontologies. Software content consists of editors for information of different kinds (ontologies, bases of observations, knowledge and data), and also of a program which performs <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostics...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Waste {{produced}} by health and treatment centers (hospitals) including <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> laboratories {{is one of}} the sources of municipal waste production. Waste {{produced by}} <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> laboratories due to the existence of pathogens and infectious materials by high importance {{is one of the}} environmental issues. This survey has been done on the qualitative-quantitative analytical bases, and the investigation has focused on the management strategies of the waste material of <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> laboratories of Rasht, Iran in 2009. Methods: In this descriptive study, samples were collected from 19 <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> laboratories of Rasht in 3 consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday every week), after filling the questionnaire and interviewing with the managers. Then, the samples were separated manually, and divided into 46 different constituents and weighed. Next, the constituents were classified based on characteristics and potentiality of being hazardous. Results: The total amount of annual waste production by the <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> laboratories of Rasht is 25785. 143 kg. In this study, the share of manufacturing conventional waste (domestic type wastes), especially infectious, chemical, pharmaceutical, and radioactive wastes were 1. 16 %, 95. 34 %, 1. 42 % and 2. 08 %, respectively. The highest and lowest amount of waste production relates to plastic materials and wood which are 48. 37 and 0. 43 %, respectively. In this study sharp cutting things were calculated to be 10. 52 %. Furthermore, 84 percent of the managers of the <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> laboratories had not had enough information of the circulars and instructions on the enforceable management strategies of the medical wastes. Conclusion: Concerning the management of the medical waste production in the <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> laboratories, it is suggested that the managers and the personnel be trained on the separation, collection, and disinfection techniques and final disposal, and the wastes have to be treated per regulations and instructions...|$|R
