40|$|Restoring a {{large-scale}} power system {{has always been}} a complicated and important issue. A lot of research work has been done on different aspects of the whole power system restoration procedure. However, more time will be required to complete the power system restoration process in an actual situation if accurate and real-time system data cannot be obtained. With the development of the wide area monitoring system (WAMS), power system operators are capable of accessing to more accurate data in the restoration stage after a major outage. The ultimate goal of the system restoration is to restore as much load as possible while in the shortest period of time after a blackout, and the <b>restorable</b> <b>load</b> can be estimated by employing WAMS. Moreover, discrete restorable loads are employed considering the limited number of circuit-breaker operations and the practical topology of distribution systems. In this work, a <b>restorable</b> <b>load</b> estimation method is proposed employing WAMS data after the network frame has been reenergized, and WAMS is also employed to monitor the system parameters in case the newly recovered system becomes unstable again. The proposed method has been validated with the New England 39 -Bus system and an actual power system in Guangzhou, China...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: System {{restoration}} {{following a}} blackout {{is one of}} the most important tasks for power system planning and operation. The restoration process returns the system back to a normal operating condition following an outage of the system. With the development of the wide area monitoring system (WAMS) using neuro control technique, voltage can be controlled and power system operators are capable of accessing to more accurate data in the restoration stage after a major outage. In this work, a <b>restorable</b> <b>load</b> estimation method is proposed by employing WAMS to monitor the system parameters in case the newly recovered system becomes unstable again. The concept of power conversion from renewable energy sources is included to compensate voltage sag during addition of new loads are analyzed and simulated using MATLAB. This improves the overall system reliability and avoids cascaded blackout during fault occurrence...|$|E

In [33], a novel sectionalizing method is {{proposed for the}} build-up strategy including two processes, restoring separated parts (islands) in the power system and then interconnecting them afterwards. Each island ensures observability and provides the phase angle difference between adjacent stations using the WAMS. In [61], a <b>restorable</b> <b>load</b> estimation method is proposed employing WAMS data after the network frame has been reenergized, and the WAMS is also employed to monitor the system parameters in case the newly recovered system becomes unstable again. Ref. [76] presents a method for optimal restoration planning which uses observability analysis and {{power transfer distribution factor}} (PTDF) to decrease the overvoltages caused by energizing transmission lines with light load. The use of the WAMS at the early stages of restoration provides precise determination of generators loading steps. It is a significant benefit of WAMS to unify phase angle references at different islands and present a tie line energizing priority list at the last stages of restoration [77]. Ref. [78] explores a methodology to control and monitor frequency during the early steps of power system restoration, and uses generator modeling to calculate the single machine equivalent of the power system based on phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements. There is potentially highly valuable opportunity {{to take full advantage of}} WAMSâ€™s timely situation awareness in rapid and effective power system restoration.|$|E
