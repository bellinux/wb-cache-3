5|$|Under Kentucky's first {{constitution}} (1792), the Speaker of the Kentucky Senate became acting governor {{upon the}} death, resignation, or {{removal of the}} sitting governor from office, until a new election could be held. The 1799 constitution created the office of lieutenant governor, who acted as Speaker of the Senate, but was not otherwise considered {{a member of that}} body. The lieutenant governor was to become governor in the event of the sitting governor's death, resignation, or <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>office</b> and was to act in a gubernatorial capacity any time the governor was out of the state. Whenever the lieutenant governor became acting governor, the Senate was to elect one of its members to act as Speaker; that individual then became next in the line of gubernatorial succession. A provision of the 1850 constitution added that, if the governor's term had more than two years remaining {{at the time of his}} death, resignation, or <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>office,</b> a special election would be called to fill the office; the lieutenant governor would be acting governor in the interim.|$|E

Palmer succeeded, but the territorial legislature petitioned for his <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>office,</b> which became effective in 1857.|$|E

5|$|Bradley {{did much}} to {{advance the cause of}} blacks in Kentucky. He denounced racially {{motivated}} lynchings and demanded that county officials prosecute racial violence. He called a special legislative session in March 1897 to consider an anti-lynching bill that imposed penalties including a fine of up to $500 and <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>office</b> for any peace officer who did not prevent a lynching or mob violence. It further empowered peace officers to recruit able-bodied men to help protect prisoners and fined them for failing to do so, if necessary. Despite the politically divided legislature, the bill quickly passed both houses of the General Assembly and Bradley signed it on May 11, 1897. In January 1898, Bradley accepted an invitation to speak before the Anti-Mob and Lynch Law Association in Springfield, Ohio. During Bradley's four-year term, twenty-five lynchings were committed in the state, down from fifty-six during the term of his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaneously to {{establishment}} {{of the office of}} the President, representatives of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the Soviet constitution which stated that the Soviet Union was a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party which, in turn, played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the Party and its hegemony over the Soviet Union and its people. Upon death, resignation, or <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>office</b> of an incumbent President, the Vice President of the Soviet Union would assume the office, though the Soviet Union collapsed before this was actually tested.

5|$|Following Nikolai Podgorny's <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>office,</b> rumours started {{circulating}} {{within the}} top circles, {{and on the}} streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health. During one of Kosygin's spells on sick leave, Brezhnev appointed Nikolai Tikhonov, a like-minded conservative, to the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers; through this office Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a backup role. For example, at a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, not Kosygin. Following Kosygin's resignation in 1980, Tikhonov, {{at the age of}} 75, was elected the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers. At the end of his life, Kosygin feared the complete failure of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981â€“1985), believing that the sitting leadership was reluctant to reform the stagnant Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} term, Nixon ordered an airlift to {{resupply}} Israeli {{losses in the}} Yom Kippur War, resulting in the restart of the Middle East peace process and an oil crisis at home.

By late 1973, the Watergate scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support. On August 9, 1974, he resigned {{in the face of}} almost certain impeachment and <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>office.</b> After his resignation, he was issued a pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford.

5|$|Johnson {{implemented}} his own form of Presidential Reconstructionâ€“ {{a series}} of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. When Southern states returned many of their old leaders, and passed Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, Congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. Johnson vetoed their bills, and Congressional Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern {{for the remainder of}} his presidency. Johnson opposed the Fourteenth Amendment, which gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1866, Johnson went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies, seeking to destroy his Republican opponents. As the conflict between the branches of government grew, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson's ability to fire Cabinet officials. When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>office.</b> After failing to win the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination, Johnson left office in 1869.|$|E

Public Protector Thuli Madonsela found Tlakula had been involved in building procurement irregularities in a report published in August 2013, and a subsequent National Treasury review published in March 2014 supported her findings. Five days before the election, the Electoral Court postponed the inquiry into her conduct until 2 June 2014, as it {{would not be able to}} rule on the matter before the 7 May election date. On 18 June, the Electoral Court recommended Tlakula's <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>office</b> due to financial misconduct.

5|$|While {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} the Acts, Josephine had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there was a slave trade of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution. A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>office</b> of the head of the Belgian , and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were all involved in the trade. Josephine fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, William Thomas Stead, who purchased a 13-year-old girl from her mother for Â£5. The subsequent outcry led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 years of age and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the British Raj.|$|E
50|$|During this time, the Polish {{policy was}} {{directed}} to Kievan Rus'. The Rurikid princes of the Rostislavich line, then in power in Russia, didn't recognise Polish sovereignty, and led a hostile policy against them (especially Prince Vasilko of Terebovlia, allied with the Kipchaks) by repeated invasions to Poland. Sieciech was installed as the effective ruler of Poland. He demonstrated this by minting his own coin and consolidated his position by appointing his supporters to the judiciary. The main ambitions of Sieciech were his lust for power {{and the desire to}} enrich himself. To achieve his objectives, he was able to use violent methods. The repressive actions of Sieciech (selling into slavery, <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>offices,</b> sentences of exile) caused a massive political emigration from Polish territories to Bohemia.|$|R

5|$|Podgorny's <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>office</b> in 1977 {{has become}} the most notable example of power {{transfer}} in the late Brezhnev Era. According to Robert Vincent Daniels, Podgorny was before his removal the second most powerful man in the Soviet Union, behind Brezhnev but ahead of Premier Kosygin. The post of Chairman of the Presidium had acquired more powers during his tenure, and had changed from a largely honorary office to the second most important office in the USSR. Though there were some Sovietologists who foresaw Podgorny's fall, the decision to remove Podgorny from the Politburo took the world by surprise. On 24 May 1977, a unanimous vote was taken by the Central Committee after Grigory Romanov proposed removing Podgorny from the Politburo. The vote seemed to have taken Podgorny by surprise, and immediately after the vote, he got up from his politburo seat to instead sit with the ordinary members. The Central Committee had however only voted him off the Politburo, and Podgorny still retained the position of Chairman of the Presidium. After his removal from the Politburo Podgorny's name disappeared from Soviet media. The Soviet media told the Soviet people that he had retired due to his stance against dÃ©tente and producing more consumer goods. Podgorny finally lost his Chairmanship of the Presidium on 16 June 1977.|$|E
