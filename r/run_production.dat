5|$|After a small {{quantity}} {{was struck}} for circulation, the Mint received complaints regarding the prominent placement of Gobrecht's {{name on the}} dollar, and the design was modified to incorporate his name in a less conspicuous position. In January 1837, the legal standard for the percentage of precious metal in silver coins was changed from 89.2% to 90%, and the Gobrecht dollars struck after that point reflect this change. In total, 1,900 Gobrecht dollars were struck during the official production <b>run.</b> <b>Production</b> of the Seated Liberty dollar, which utilized the same obverse design as the Gobrecht dollar, began mintage in 1840. In the 1850s, Mint officials controversially re-struck the coins without authorization.|$|E

5|$|Wiggins {{was moved}} to second base in 1984. That move made room for rookie Carmelo Martínez in the outfield. Until that season, Martínez had been a first baseman, but the Padres already had a strong player there with Garvey, {{and they wanted to}} get Martínez's bat into the lineup to improve their outfield's home <b>run</b> <b>production.</b> Wiggins {{retained}} the leadoff spot in the lineup, hitting ahead of Tony Gwynn. During a May game, Wiggins became the fifth 20th-century MLB player to steal five bases in one game, tying an NL record. In an August game, Wiggins unwittingly became a party to a series of fights. Wiggins was hit with the first pitch of the game by Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez. The teams retaliated against each other throughout the game with brushback pitches and beanballs. The tension resulted in three fights and several ejections.|$|E

Greenberg in turn, demanded a $10,000 dollar bonus if he mastered the outfield, stating he was the one taking the risk in learning a new position. Greenberg received his bonus at the end of spring training.|$|E

25|$|At {{about the}} same time that {{catchers}} began fielding their position closer to home plate, baseball teams began using a less rubbery ball which led to a {{decline in the number of}} runs scored. In the 1860s it was common for teams to score fifty or sixty runs in a game. The combination of the new, harder ball and the continuation of the rise in pitcher's release points helped usher in what became known as the Dead-ball era. The decrease in <b>run</b> <b>production</b> placed greater significance on stolen bases and bunts, which in turn emphasized the crucial defensive role played by catchers. Together, the rules changes and the new protective equipment transformed the catcher's defensive role to the way that it is presently played.|$|E
500|$|Late in the 1990 season, the Red Sox, {{who were}} in search of relief {{pitching}} to improve their chances of making the playoffs, contacted the Houston Astros about Larry Andersen. [...] Stan Benjamin, who scouted the New England region for the Astros, recommended that they ask for Bagwell in return. [...] The Astros initially hesitated owing to his sparse home <b>run</b> <b>production,</b> but Benjamin persuaded them, quipping that New Britain's Beehive Field was so large that [...] "Babe Ruth couldn’t hit home runs in that ballpark." [...] On August 30, 1990, the Red Sox took the Astros' offer. [...] The trade is now {{considered one of the}} most one-sided trades in baseball history; in 2001, ESPN's readers named it the second-worst trade in sports history, behind only the Red Sox trading Ruth to the New York Yankees. [...] Although Andersen pitched well down the stretch in 1990 – he allowed three runs in 22 innings of relief – to help the Red Sox secure the American League East division title on the final day of the season, the Oakland Athletics swept Boston out of the American League Championship Series (ALCS). [...] They then lost Andersen after the season when he was declared a free agent due to the third collusion settlement.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records. Among those records, he ranked as the major league career leader in extra-base hits (1,377) and total bases (6,134). He also held NL career marks in {{categories}} such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI (1,951). He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category. [...] Jerry Lansche speculates Musial would likely have become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBI, and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military. [...] His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 (in 1942) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2,000 for his full career, he certainly would have exceeded 2,000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945. [...] His home <b>run</b> <b>production</b> is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500. [...] He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 (the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member) until 1948, 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II. [...] His career hit total was evenly split between 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road. [...] Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb's career hit record of 4,191. [...] Even if Musial had hit safely 207 times (the average of his hits in the 2 years before and the 2 years after his service in the navy) in 1945, he still would have been 354 hits short of tying Ty. [...] His hit total in his last season at age 42 was only 86; even if he could have had 103 hits a season (the average of his last 5 seasons) {{he would have had to}} play to age 47 to attain the hits record.|$|E

2500|$|The season {{became known}} as the year of the pitcher, with batting averages and <b>run</b> <b>production</b> {{dropping}} in both the American and National Leagues. After the record home-run year by Roger Maris in 1961, the major leagues increased the size of the strike zone {{from the top of the}} batter's shoulders to the bottom of the knees. Pitchers such as McLain and Gibson among others dominated hitters, producing 339 shutouts in 1968. Carl Yastrzemski was the only American League hitter to finish the season with a batting average higher than [...]300. In the National League, Gibson posted a 1.12 earned run average, the lowest in 54 years while, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale threw a record 58 and two-thirds consecutive scoreless innings during the 1968 season. As a result of the dropping offensive statistics, Major League Baseball took steps to reduce the advantage held by pitchers by lowering the height of the pitcher's mound from 15 inches to 10 inches, and by reducing the size of the strike zone for the 1969 season.|$|E

She also informed the festival that her government would not allow her to attend the festival, nor were they allowing her to direct films. The festival then began to apply international pressure upon the Czechoslovakian government by petitioning on Chytilová’s behalf.

2500|$|Following {{a role in}} Halfway to Heaven (1929) {{opposite}} popular actor Charles [...] "Buddy" [...] Rogers (of which Variety {{opined that}} her career could be heading somewhere if she acquired more sex appeal), Selznick assigned her to play William Powell's wife in Street of Chance (1930). She did not impress the film's director John Cromwell, who advised the actress {{to move back to}} New York because she would not make it in Hollywood. By 1930, her relationship with Selznick had ended, causing her career at Paramount to slip. Following a string of [...] "lifeless ingenue roles" [...] in mediocre films, she debuted on stage in December 1930 with a supporting role in Pasadena Playhouse's ten-day <b>run</b> <b>production</b> of Spring Song. Back in Hollywood, Arthur saw her career deteriorating, and she dyed her hair blonde in an attempt to boost her image and avoid comparison with more successful actress Mary Brian. Her effort did not pay off: when her three-year contract at Paramount expired in mid-1931, she was given her release with an announcement from Paramount that the decision was due to financial setbacks caused by the Great Depression.|$|E
2500|$|Gwynn {{placed in}} the top 10 in voting for the National League MVP seven times in his career, {{including}} his only top-five finish in 1984, when he ended up third. In 2005, Sporting News ranked Gwynn No. 57 {{on the list of}} their 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and he was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. However, Gwynn's significance is muted by the non-traditional measurements in sabermetrics, which tends to favor power and the ability to get on base over batting average. As of 2014, his career 65.0 WAR ranked 34th among outfielders, and a few above him had not yet been voted into the Hall of Fame. While he had a first-rate on-base percentage of [...]388, he was one of only four players to hit [...]335 or more who did not have career [...]400 OBP. During his career, he finished in the top-10 in the NL in OBP 10 times. Gwynn's <b>run</b> <b>production</b> was another rap against him.
