5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and <b>rear</b> <b>frame,</b> and between the rider and the <b>rear</b> <b>frame.</b> Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the <b>rear</b> <b>frame,</b> etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Meijaard, et al., {{published}} the canonical linearized equations of motion, in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A, along with verification by two different methods. These equations assumed the tires to roll without slip, {{that is to}} say, to go where they point, and the rider to be rigidly attached to the <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> of the bicycle.|$|E
5|$|The lateral and {{torsional}} stiffness of the <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> and the wheel spindle affects wobble-mode damping substantially. Long wheelbase and trail and a flat steering-head angle {{have been found}} to increase weave-mode damping. Lateral distortion can be countered by locating the front fork torsional axis as low as possible.|$|E
5000|$|Drum {{rear wheel}} into <b>rear</b> disc <b>frame</b> needs the <b>rear</b> drum <b>frame</b> {{swingarm}} too.|$|R
5000|$|O4/4, Rebuilt with O2 boiler, {{extended}} <b>rear</b> <b>frames</b> {{and side}} window cab, since rebuilt again.|$|R
5000|$|Disk {{rear wheel}} into <b>rear</b> drum <b>frame</b> needs the <b>rear</b> disc <b>frame</b> {{swingarm}} and also needs brake master-cylinder lugs welded to the frame.|$|R
5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to {{one side or the}} other, the entire <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle and the amount of trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} {{locomotives}} Nos. 6256 and 46257 Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S and City of Salford were given many new features. In order {{to raise the}} mileage between general overhauls from 70,000 to 100,000, measures were taken to decrease wear to the axle bearings and hornguides {{through the use of}} roller bearings and manganese steel linings. Other modifications included further superheating area, a redesigned <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> and cast steel trailing truck, rocking grate, hopper ashpan and redesigned cab-sides.|$|E
5|$|The finite {{width of}} the tires alters the actual lean angle of the <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> from the ideal lean angle {{described}} above. The actual lean angle between the frame and the vertical must increase with tire width and decrease with center of mass height. Bikes with fat tires and low center of mass must lean more than bikes with skinnier tires or higher centers of mass to negotiate the same turn at the same speed.|$|E
50|$|The Hendrie C, {{as it was}} popularly known, {{was similar}} to the Class A Hendrie A in general proportions, but with Walschaerts valve gear, 1+1/2 in larger {{diameter}} coupled wheels, a larger boiler with a higher boiler pressure and a more enclosed cab which offered better protection to the crew. They were equipped with Hendrie's steam reversing gear and had wide Belpaire fireboxes, carried down between the <b>rear</b> <b>frames</b> which had been widened by using a bridle casting.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} version used {{upper and lower}} square-section steel frames, clad with glass fibre panels and large flat glass windows. On most models sliding side windows acted as doors. It used the front and <b>rear</b> sub <b>frames</b> and mechanical components from the British Leyland Mini, Metro or BMC1100/1300. The Hustler came in four and six wheel versions: the six wheel version used two Mini <b>rear</b> sub <b>frame</b> assemblies. The style was very much off-road/utility in the rectilinear idiom of the Lagonda and Bulldog.|$|R
5000|$|Station wagons are {{generally}} called estate cars or simply estates in the United Kingdom. The term shooting-brake, {{a term for}} an original hunting vehicle, {{came to be known}} synonymously with station wagon and were also custom built as modified luxury coupés with an estate car-like back. They generally retain two side doors. Until the early 1960s many of them were built with structural wooden <b>rear</b> <b>frames,</b> making them some of the most expensive and luxurious [...] "woodies" [...] ever built.|$|R
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also involved is the yawing of the <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
25|$|Wheelbase is the {{horizontal}} {{distance between the}} centers (or the ground contact points) of {{the front and rear}} wheels. Wheelbase is a function of <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> length, steering axis angle, and fork offset. It is similar to the term wheelbase used for automobiles and trains.|$|E
25|$|Built in 1839 as the United States Army Officers Quarters, it is {{a two-story}} masonry brick main building, with -story wings and front and <b>rear</b> porches <b>framed</b> with carved brackets.|$|R
50|$|Plunger rear {{suspension}} was offered later, with a swingarm <b>rear</b> suspension <b>frame</b> available from 1954. The model continued in production until 1959, {{by which time}} the traditional Lucas magdyno {{had been replaced by}} an alternator and coil ignition.|$|R
50|$|The Melon Slice folding bike can be {{outfitted}} {{with a pair of}} mud guards to keep rain and dirt from soiling the riders clothing. The mud guards bolt onto the front fork and the <b>rear</b> reflector <b>frame</b> member.|$|R
25|$|The Mark IV, {{launched}} in 1976, introduced a front rubber mounted subframe with single tower bolts and larger bushes in the <b>rear</b> <b>frame.</b> In addition twin stalk indicators were introduced with larger foot pedals, and from 1977 onwards the rear indicator lamps had the reverse lights incorporated in them.|$|E
25|$|Some sidecar rigs {{allow the}} {{motorcycle}} to lean {{independent of the}} sidecar, and in some rigs, the sidecar even leans in parallel with the bike. Rigs like these are countersteered {{the same way as}} a solo motorcycle. The three wheel Piaggio MP3 uses mechanical linkages to lean the two front wheels in parallel with the <b>rear</b> <b>frame,</b> and so that it is countersteered {{in the same manner as}} a two-wheeled motorcycle.|$|E
25|$|The Hamada pistol is a {{blowback}} {{pistol and}} functionally {{a copy of}} the Browning Model 1910. The most significant design difference between the Hamada pistol and Browning Model 1910 is the replacement of the interrupter lugs used to hold the barrel of the Browning Model 1910 with a dovetail joint. The frame plate lock design and striker assembly were also modified and awarded patents in 1943. The Hamada pistol maintained high quality throughout its production, with the bluing done to a high standard. The safety, <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> plate, and extractor were heat tempered to a reddish brown and the barrel, striker, and firing mechanism were brightly polished.|$|E
50|$|The church's pipe organ, {{originally}} {{built in}} 1906 for St. Ignatius Church in San Francisco, saved from fire {{resulting from the}} 1906 earthquake, was acquired by St. Joseph parish and installed in 1926. After being at risk because of another fire, {{this time in the}} original church, built in 1905, it was re-installed in the new church in 1928. The instrument went through many modifications from 1965 to 2005, and now has a new console (1981) and pipe ranks. The organ pipes occupy {{a great deal of the}} choir loft, with the Great pipes centrally located at the <b>rear</b> <b>framing</b> the rose window. The Swell and Choir pipes are contained in chambers on either side of the rose window.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{triangulated}} {{rigid frame}} {{was introduced in}} 1920, it was ahead of its time. By 1939, when the sprung heel and <b>rear</b> swingarm <b>frames</b> had begun to appear so rigid frames had seen their day [...] Vincent had patented a cantilever frame in 1928.|$|R

2500|$|Lowering {{the car was}} a major undertaking. [...] The {{rear axle}} now passed through the <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> rather than riding under it, and a dry-sump {{lubrication}} system was required to fit the engine under the new low hood. [...] The 57S had a nearly-independent suspension in front, though Ettore despised that notion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{elevated}} chainstay bicycle {{was popular}} in the early 90s. It featured a rear triangle with elevated bottom frame stays, negating {{the need for the}} chain to be drawn through the <b>rear</b> <b>frame.</b> [...] This allowed for a shorter wheelbase and improved handling during technical ascents, at the cost of compromised integrity and resultant increased bottom bracket flex (unless reinforced) compared to a frame with traditional chainstays.|$|E
2500|$|The {{braking surface}} is {{farther from the}} ground and {{possible}} contaminants like mud which can coat or freeze on the rim and pads. [...] With rim brakes, the first point that mud builds up on a mountain bike ridden in thick mud is usually the brakes. [...] A mountain bicycle with disc brakes is [...] less susceptible to mud buildup provided the <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> and front fork yoke have sufficient clearance from the wheels.|$|E
50|$|The Versys {{is based}} on the same {{platform}} as Kawasaki's other 650cc twin motorcycles, the Ninja 650R and the ER-6n. It shares the same electronics, engine, wheels, brakes and main frame as its siblings. Where it differs is in riding position, <b>rear</b> sub <b>frame,</b> suspension components, and engine tuning.|$|R
50|$|Trim {{levels are}} denoted {{by a small}} badge on the <b>rear</b> window <b>frame</b> on the VT/VTR+ and Airdream+ and by a small chrome badge on each front door on Exclusive models. Norev have {{produced}} a 1:43 scale model of the new Citroën C3 in Botticelli Blue, Metallic Green and black.|$|R
50|$|A 2WD {{off-road}} {{car with}} a RS540 motor in the <b>rear.</b> The <b>frame</b> {{was that of the}} Alpine A310. Uses a double wishbone for front suspension, and a semi-streaming arm for rear suspension. The cars aluminum <b>frame</b> and <b>rear</b> design were passed on to the Scorpion. Sold for 16,000 yen at the time.|$|R
2500|$|Prime movers {{were used}} to tow field {{artillery}} pieces, they also transported gun crews, equipment, and ammunition. They had a pintle hitch at the rear for towing up to [...] Another pintle at the front {{could be used to}} emplace the piece. A mid-mounted [...] winch had a centered cable drum and a capstan on the right side. Pulleys and rollers routed the cable under the body and out the <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> cross-member.|$|E
2500|$|A {{constant}} flow of modifications were made as production progressed. A [...] "blown" [...] cockpit hood, manufactured by Malcolm, {{was introduced in}} an effort to further increase the pilot's head-room and visibility. Many mid to late production VBs – and all VCs – used the modified, improved windscreen assembly with the integral bullet resistant centre panel and flat side screens introduced with the Mk III. Because the <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> of this windscreen was taller than that of the earlier model the cockpit hoods were not interchangeable and could be distinguished by the wider rear framing on the hood used with the late-style windscreen.|$|E
2500|$|Early K-M20 {{models from}} 1939 {{were made from}} {{standard}} civilian parts {{with the addition of}} military fittings, such as a [...] large 8-inch Lucas DUl42 headlight (fitted with a black out mask), a timing-gear cover with a screw-in plug for access to the magneto drive-pinion nut and special filler caps for the petrol and oil tanks. These early military M20 models were also fitted with a long spiked prop stand on the rear nearside pivoted from a lug brazed on to the <b>rear</b> <b>frame</b> tube. Factory ledgers show that BSA exported K-M20 models to Sweden, South Africa and India, as well as civilian dealers and distributors.|$|E
