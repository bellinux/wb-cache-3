40|$|AbstractA “closed loop” system {{consisting}} of the wave equation with a feedback acting in the Dirichlet boundary condition {{in the form of}} a nonlocal, one-dimensional <b>range</b> <b>operator,</b> defined on the “velocity” vector (damping) is considered. Beside the well-posedness question (generation of a feedback C 0 -semigroup), the boundary feedback stabilization problem is studied: while asymptotic decay to zero in the uniform operator norm can never occur for the considered class of closed loop systems, however checkable sufficient conditions on the vectors in the boundary conditions are provided that guarantee asymptotic decay to zero in the strong norm of appropriate Sobolev spaces. These conditions include, but are not limited to, the standard case of dissipativity of the feedback system. The starting point of this approach is a functional analytic model for the study of nonsmooth boundary input hyperbolic equations recently developed (I. Lasiecka and R. Triggiani, Appl. Math.

However, LexAGen also supports several context sensitive programming language constructs like nested comments and the interaction between floating point numbers and the <b>range</b> <b>operator</b> in Modula- 2. In addition, LexAGen includes a fast new algorithm for keyword identification. However, the most important and novel aspects of LexAGen are that it constructs scanners incrementally and that specifications can be executed anytime for validation testing. LexAGen specifications are expressed and entered interactively in a restricted BNF format (no left recursion). All syntactic errors and token conflicts are detected and reported immediately as LexAGen incrementally constructs a deterministic finite automaton to represent the scanner. At any time, the user can test the scanner fragment which has been entered by supplying text to be scanned. Alternatively, the user can generate a C-code scanner from the automaton. The generated automaton uses a direct execution approach and is quite fast. LexAGen is implemented in Smalltalk- 80. Its extensive use of interactive graphics makes it very easy to use. In addition, the object-oriented paradigm of Smalltalk- 80 is the basis for the incremental analysis, error detection scheme and an intermediate representation which can be easily modified to generate scanners in other target languages like Pascal, Modula- 2 and Ada.

Traditional cube approaches only use Equal operator in their summarized queries. Recent cube approaches implement <b>range</b> query <b>operators,</b> but they suffer from dimensionality problem, where a linear dimension increase consumes exponential storage space and runtime. Frag-Cubing and its extension, using bitmap index, {{are the most}} promising sequential solutions for high dimension data cubes, but they implement only Equal and Sub-cube query operators. In this paper, we implement a new high dimension sequential range cube approach, named Range Query Cube or just qCube. The qCube implements Equal, Not Equal, Distinct, Sub-cube, Greater or Less than, Some, Between, Similar and Top-k Similar query operators over a high dimension data cube. Comparative tests with qCube and Frag-Cubing use relations with 20, 30 or 60 dimensions, 5 k distinct values on each dimension and 10 million tuples. In general, qCube has similar behavior when compared with Frag-Cubing, but it is faster to answer point and inquire queries. Frag-Cubing could not answer inquire queries with more than two Sub-cube operators in a relation with 30 dimensions, 5 k cardinality and 10 M tuples. In addition, qCube efficiently answered inquire queries from such a relation using six Sub-cube or Distinct operators.
