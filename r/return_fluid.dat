The presence of gas and cuttings in the drilling fluid will also have a negative effect in the measurement i. e. for multi-phase fluid, the readings from Coriolis meters may not be accurate.

The 2010 Macondo blowout accident in the Gulf of Mexico was an eye-opener for many oil and gas operators and oilfield service companies; thus, making early kick detection technology research one of the top industry agendas. However, only limited {{progress has been made in}} detection technologies that focus on downhole parameters due to the complexity of offshore drilling operations that is increasingly shifting towards the deepwater. Therefore, the current paper experimentally explores downhole drilling parameters for kick indication during drilling. The study utilizes a fully instrumented laboratory scale drilling rig coupled with an air injection and surface monitoring systems. This study observed a sudden jump in bottomhole pressure, increased volume of the <b>return</b> <b>fluid,</b> decreased density of the <b>return</b> <b>fluid,</b> reduced rate of penetration, and increased rotary speed as indicators of kick. The most significant new finding, which is also validated with field reports, is the dampening effects of the drilling vibrations due to kick. Frequency analysis of the axial bit–rock displacements/vibrations confirms the changes of frequencies due to kick induction during drilling. Coupling this important finding with dynamic drilling models, the response of the drilling system at surface (e.g. standpipe, choke pressures, etc.) indicating this change can be predicted.|$|E

50|$|The key to {{the torque}} converter's ability to {{multiply}} torque lies in the stator. In the classic fluid coupling design, periods of high slippage cause the <b>fluid</b> flow <b>returning</b> from the turbine to the impeller to oppose the direction of impeller rotation, leading to a significant loss of efficiency and the generation of considerable waste heat. Under the same condition in a torque converter, the <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> will be redirected by the stator so that it aids {{the rotation of the}} impeller, instead of impeding it. The result is that much of the energy in the <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> is recovered and added to the energy being applied to the impeller by the prime mover. This action causes a substantial increase in the mass of fluid being directed to the turbine, producing an increase in output torque. Since the <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> is initially traveling in a direction opposite to impeller rotation, the stator will likewise attempt to counter-rotate as it forces the fluid to change direction, an effect that is prevented by the one-way stator clutch.|$|R
30|$|This is a {{major concern}} as {{acidizing}} fluid consisting of diesel can contaminate the groundwater when it is flushed into the surface; moreover, after reacting with the subsurface minerals, the acidizing medium becomes more dangerous; thus, during production, the <b>fluid</b> flowback (<b>returning</b> <b>fluid)</b> is hazardous even after treatment when releasing it into the local water supply.|$|R

Once in the coupling phase, the <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> will reverse direction and now rotate {{in the direction of}} the impeller and turbine, an effect which will attempt to forward-rotate the stator.

The Antarctic Geological Drilling (ANDRILL) {{researchers}} {{obtained a}} rock core from below the sea-floor in South McMurdo Sound (SMS), Antarctica. During the core retrieval, approximately 5. 6 x 105 liters of drilling fluid {{was lost in}} the subsurface. The loss of this fluid, which contained biodegradable components, may significantly alter the in situ microbial ecology as well as the geochemistry of the subsurface. The introduction of drilling fluid into the subsurface {{can be viewed as a}} source of contamination. However, it also provides the opportunity to indirectly study the microbial communities of the subsurface through analyses of the <b>return</b> drilling <b>fluids.</b> This study focused on the differences between new (uncirculated) <b>fluids</b> and the <b>return</b> drilling <b>fluids</b> circulated at depth, along with the chemical and microbial changes that took place during the biodegradation of drilling fluid. Drilling fluid samples were incubated for forty days at 4, 20 and 50 °C representing the in situ temperatures, under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Geochemical analyses were completed and microbial community fingerprints were constructed and compared. The <b>return</b> <b>fluids</b> show significant differences in the geochemistry compared to the new fluids specifically in regards to the ions Barium, Thallium, Lead, Manganese, Iron, and Boron. The <b>return</b> drilling <b>fluids</b> have higher DNA concentrations than the new fluids counterparts within the first four days of the biodegradation experiment. The use of Biolog Ecoplates(TM) revealed that microbes in the <b>return</b> <b>fluids</b> utilized significantly less carbon substrates than those in the new fluids. RAPD-PCR results showed the <b>return</b> <b>fluids</b> exhibited significantly less diversity and species evenness than the microbes in the new fluids. DNA concentrations fluctuated over time, with a direct relationship among fluid type. There are shifts in the community structure and function as biodegradation occurs that varies between the different incubation environments. In situ temperatures ≤ 4 °C were recorded for the top ~ 21 meters of the borehole. In anaerobic environments and temperatures ≤ 4 °C, slower microbial metabolism may increase the residence time of the biodegradable drilling fluid components, allowing these components the opportunity to penetrate further into the surrounding formation through conduits. The 20 °C temperatures recorded at ~ 360 -~ 384 mbsf may be the most favorable conditions for the biodegradation of the drilling fluids allowing the least amount of migration of the biodegradable components into the surrounding formation. At a depth of ~ 1026 mbsf, 50 °C in situ borehole temperatures were recorded. From this depth through to the final depth of ~ 1139 mbsf and 57 °C, the higher temperatures may result in smaller microbial populations that are able to metabolize the drilling fluid, leading to further drilling fluid migration into the surrounding formation.

40|$|Background: One of the {{challenges}} of anaesthesia for shoulder arthroscopic procedures {{is the need for}} controlled hypotension to lessen intra-articular haemorrhage and thereby provide adequate visualisation to the surgeon. Achievement of optimal conditions necessitates several interventions and manipulations by the anaesthesiologist and the surgeon, most of which directly or indirectly involve maintaining intra-operative blood pressure (BP) control. Aim: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and convenience of target controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol and inhalational agent sevoflurane in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopic surgery after preliminary inter-scalene blockade. Methods: Of thirty four patients studied, seventeen received TCI propofol (target plasma concentration of 3 μg/ml) and an equal number, sevoflurane (1. 2 - 1. 5 Minimum Alveolar Concentration). N 2 O was used in both groups. Systolic, diastolic, mean blood pressures and heart rate were recorded regularly throughout the procedure. All interventions to control BP by the anaesthesiologist and pump manipulation requested by the surgeon were recorded. The volume of saline irrigant used and the haemoglobin (Hb) content of the <b>return</b> <b>fluid</b> were measured. Results: TCI propofol could achieve lower systolic, mean BP levels and the number of interventions required was also lower as compared to the sevoflurane group. The number of patients with measurable Hb was lower in the TCI propofol group and this translated into better visualisation of the joint space. A higher volume of saline irrigant was required in the sevoflurane group. No immediate peri-operative anaesthetic complications were noted in either category.

40|$|The {{lymphatic system}} acts to <b>return</b> <b>fluid</b> from the {{interstitial}} space {{back into the}} blood circulation. In normal conditions, lymphangions, the segment of lymphatic vessel in between valves, cyclically contract and can pump lymph from low pressure tissues to the higher-pressure veins of the neck. With edema, however, this pressure gradient can reverse, {{and the role of}} contraction is less clear. Like ventricles, lymphangions are sensitive to both preload and afterload. Unlike ventricles, lymphangions are arranged in series, so that the outlet pressure of one lymphangion becomes the inlet pressure of another. Anything that alters the relative timing and frequency of adjacent lymphangions alters both preload and afterload of each lymphangion and thus mean lymph flow. To explore the effect of timing and frequency of contraction on lymph flow, we developed a computational model of a lymphatic vessel with lymphangions described by the classic description of time-varying elastance. When pumping up a pressure gradient, as in normal conditions, or when pumping down a pressure gradient, as in some cases of edema, we found that flow was optimized when the lymphangions in the vessel were pumping with a very short time delay between their cycles, and the flow was reduced when the time delay between the contractions was reduced to zero. However, a difference in frequency between adjacent lymphangions alters instantaneous flow but does not affect mean flow. These results suggest an important role for the timing of the contraction in optimizing lymph flow. However, a difference in frequencies between adjacent lymphangions has little effect on altering lymph flow, suggesting that tight control of lymphangion coordination may not be critical for lymphatic function...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} {{the nature of}} geothermal energy, by conducting a comprehensive literature review on this topic {{and looked into the}} possibilities of energy extraction from abandoned petroleum wells as a more economical way comparing to the dedicated geothermal wells. A heat transfer process from formation to the working fluid inside the geostring through multiple interfaces (formation/annular region, annular region/geostring wall, geostring wall/working fluid) is modeled. This approach gives information about how much heat can be extracted from the formation comparing to the most commonly used assumption of negligible thermal resistance of these interfaces. We have also performed an extensive sensitivity study to determine the optimal operational parameters during working fluid circulation. Because the location of abandoned petroleum wells to be redesigned is predefined, and all geology-related parameters are known, in our analysis, we focused on the effect of thermophysical and transport properties of the working fluid. The study shows that both the outlet temperature and the total energy increase significantly with the increase of viscosity and thermal conductivity. At the other hand, fluid density variation did not affect the theoretical amount of geothermal heat that can be extracted from the reservoir in the case study. The specific heat capacity increased the total heat energy produced, but decreased the temperature of the <b>return</b> <b>fluid.</b> The working fluids composition should also be considered as a potentially important factor that affects the well performance, which, however, was {{not a part of the}} current study. The outlet temperature naturally increased for higher inlet temperatures, whereas the rate of increase was lower than the magnitude of the outlet temperature increase, which indicated that the process optimization has to be done with respect to other parameters. A higher inner diameter of the geostring provided more beneficial output due to the increased heat convection within the fluid. Finally, geostring insulation made of material with low thermal conductivity is preferred due to its ability to preserve accumulated heat and prevent it from dissipation.|$|E
40|$|A concept {{review of}} {{concentric}} coiled tubing drilling (CTD) system is performed in this Master thesis, hereafter named DualCTD. The main {{purpose is to}} investigate and present the advantages, limitations and applications for the DualCTD system. A feasibility study {{has been carried out}} for subsea drilling of drainage holes from an existing well, and drilling of subsea production wells in the Barents Sea. The DualCTD system consists of two concentric coiled tubing (CT) strings that form a separate circulation system for the drilling fluid. Drilling fluid is pumped down the annulus between the two CT strings to the bottom hole assembly (BHA) where a mud motor generates rotation of the drill bit. The drilling fluid cleans the bit for cuttings and transports the cuttings through a circulating sub/dual float valve and into the inner string. This separated circulating system provides effective hole cleaning {{from the bottom of the}} well. The drilling fluid can be a light fluid, that is optimized for hole cleaning capabilities. A secondary annulus, formed between the DualCTD string and the borehole, is filled with a barrier fluid (BF). Viscous BF is used to separate the two fluid systems in the secondary annulus. Placing the BF in the secondary annuls below seafloor results in an optimized stabilized hydrostatic head. The BF can also be optimized for formation preserving properties. A choke valve in the <b>return</b> <b>fluid</b> line is used to control the back pressure and match the downhole pressure for the two fluid systems with the formation pressure. A light drilling fluid and a heavy BF will also increase the buoyancy of the DualCTD string. Buckling calculations conducted show that longer horizontal sections could be drilled due to increased buckling resistance and reduced friction drag for the buoyant DualCTD string. Horizontal sections of up to 2300 m can be drilled with a 3, 5 x 2, 375 DualCTD setup with a 6 bit for vertical kick-off points of 2000 m and deeper. This is more than three times as long as for conventional CTD. A hydraulic model for calculating the pressure loss in the circulating system is developed. Burst and collapse pressure was found to be limiting for the maximum flow rate due to high frictional pressure loss in the circulation system in deep wells. Cutting transport capacity of the circulation system was found to be low due to the low acceptable flow rates. Cutting transport capacity will therefore limit the maximum rate of penetration. The DualCTD system will also make it possible to drill through challenging pressure regimes, depleted reservoirs and problematic zones with its unique potential for managed pressure drilling. Well control approach for the DualCTD concept will be much of the same as in underbalanced-/managed pressure CTD operations The DualCTD blow out preventer needs to be verified for cutting of the DualCTD string. Running of casing and cementing operations may have to be performed on drill string due to the large weight of the casing and the low axial load capacity of the DualCTD string. Significant development work is needed to bring the DualCTD to a field proven meth...|$|E
