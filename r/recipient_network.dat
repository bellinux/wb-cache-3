The International and European standard is for a customer wishing to port his/her number to contact the new network (recipient), which then sends the {{number portability}} request (NPR) to the current network (donor). This is known as [...] "recipient-led" [...] porting. The UK and India are the only exceptions to implement the donor-led system. The customer wishing to port his/her number is required to contact the donor to obtain a code (Porting Authorisation Code (PAC) in the UK and Unique Porting Code (UPC) in India) which is then given to the <b>recipient</b> <b>network.</b> The recipient continues the porting process by contacting the donor with a porting code. This form of porting is known as [...] "donor-led" [...] and has been criticised by some industry analysts as being inefficient, though it prevents MNP scams. It has also been observed that it may act as customer deterrent as well as allowing the donor an opportunity of [...] "winning back" [...] the customer. This might lead to distortion of competition, especially in the markets with new entrants that are yet to achieve scalability of operation.Based on {{the recommendations of the}} Authority on MNP, dated 8 March 2006,the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued guidelines for MNPimplementation in the country on 1st Aug 2008. Subsequently, the DoT selectedtwo companies as MNP Service providers each serving in a designated zone in thecountry. As per the instructions of DoT dated 6 May 2009, a Port TransactionCharge will be charged by the MNP Service Provider from the recipient carrierfor processing each porting request. The Dipping charge shall be payable by thosetelecom service providers who utilize the dipping services (query responseservices) from the MNP Service Provider. The Porting Charge is payable by thesubscriber to the recipient carrier for porting his mobile number. The porttransaction charge, dipping charges and the porting charge shall be governed bythe Telecom Tariff Order (TTO)/ determination by TRAI.|$|E

40|$|The network {{approach}} is increasingly used by food-web ecologists and ecological parasitologists and has {{shed light on}} how parasite-host assemblages are organized, {{as well as on}} the role of parasites on the structure and stability of food webs. With accelerating rates of nonnative parasites being introduced around the world, there is an increasing need to predict their ecological impacts and the network approach can be helpful in this regard. There is inherent complexity in parasite invasions as parasites are highly diverse in terms of taxa and life strategies. Furthermore, they may depend on their cointroduced host to successfully overcome some crucial steps in the invasion process. Free-living introduced species often experience enemy release during invasion, which reduces the number of introduced parasites. However, introduced parasites that successfully establish may alter the structure of the <b>recipient</b> <b>network</b> through various mechanisms including parasite spill-over and spill-back, and manipulative and nonmanipulative phenotypic alterations. Despite limited literature on biological invasions in infectious food webs, some outstanding methodological issues and the considerable knowledge gaps that remain, the network approach provides valuable insights on some challenging questions, such as the link between structure and invasibility by parasites. Additional empirical data and theoretical investigations are needed to go further and the predictive power of the network approach will be improved by incorporating weighted methods that are based on trophic data collected using quantitative methods, such as stable isotope analyses...|$|E
40|$|DelaylDisruption {{tolerant}} networks (DTNs) are wireless networks where {{a complete}} path from source to destination {{is not in}} existence most of the time, and even when it does exist, it is highly unstable and unpredicted. This together with limited computing and storage capacity, heterogeneity and high error rate amongst others violate most of the internet assumptions. This necessitated the design of DTN architecture to relax some of the Internet assumptions and provide interoperabilijy across heterogeneous networks with different network characteristics. The identified security threats in these networks this work is designed to address are masquerading, modification, replay and unauthorized access/use of resources. This work proposes a novel access control scheme {{that is based on}} both secret-key and public-key cryptography. The scheme is designed to be independent of server availability and <b>recipient</b> <b>network</b> connectivity during post trust establishment communication. The main contributions in this thesis are: Propose and implement a lightweight asymmetric based Authorization Pass (APass) as an alternative to digital certificate; Design and implement a PKI-based trust management scheme that facilitates secure exchange of public keys without binding it to credential, access control implementation and flexible trust termination process; Propose and implement a trust based authentication scheme that employs Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) for message authentication and integrity, and APass for source authentication; Investigate and establish the applicability of the push messaging sequence of the generic AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting) architecture with modification, and extend the proposed authentication scheme to implement policy; Propose and implement generic AAA architecture concepts based access control decision making process using DTN Bundle Node.

Number portability allows a user {{to keep her}} telephone number as she moves to another provider. Number portability has been adopted by more and more countries around the world. A number that has a new provider is called a ported number. Traversal of a call to a ported number may involve three different networks: the Originating Network where the call originates, the Donor Network who initially assigned the telephone number to the subscriber, and the <b>Recipient</b> <b>Network</b> that currently hosts the subscriber's number. Currently, there are four major schemes used for routing a call to ported numbers. As of now, there has been very little quantitative study on how these schemes perform {{as more and more}} numbers are ported since there has been an an increasing trend of more subscribers choosing number portability; therefore, employing a more stable and efficient routing scheme is important. In this paper, we present a simulation study of the four routing schemes for number portability and discuss their performances under various scenarios from a connection setup delay point of view. From the simulation results, we show that of the four schemes, the ACQ scheme shows more stable performance to the ported rate, and its performance is not much affected by the system load. However, at a low ported rate, other schemes can be reasonably competitive, particularly, from the total routing delay's perspective, the OR scheme shows better performance, because it has less external links and less facilities; while with a lower ported rate, the QoR scheme is less relatively affected by its components' service rate.

This paper deals with a network-layer framework for efficient multicast through shared trees which are developed with an aid of guided information for locating nearest known on-tree nodes to connect upon receiving group join requests. Such information helps to shorten endto-end delay over a multicast shared tree so developed, called a guided shared tree (GST). A designated node, known as a guidance information node (GIN), is employed to provide guidance for a group, and the GIN is found by joining nodes through the group ID indexing into a list of candidate GINs, in a way similar to automatic core discovery for CBT.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} LENS, a novel spam protection {{system based on}} the <b>recipient’s</b> social <b>network,</b> which allows correspondence within the social circle to directly pass to the mailbox and further mitigates spam beyond social circles. The key idea in LENS is to select legitimate and authentic users, called Gatekeepers (GKs), from outside the recipients social circle and within pre-defined social distances. Unless a GK vouches for the emails of potential senders from outside the social circle of a particular recipient, those e-mails are prevented from transmission. In this way LENS drastically reduces the consumption of Internet bandwidth by spam. Using extensive evaluations, we show that LENS provides each recipient reliable email delivery from a large fraction of the social network. We also evaluate the computational complexity of email processing with LENS deployed on two Mail Servers (MSs) and compared it with the most popular content-based filter i. e SpamAssassin. LENS proved to be fast in processing emails (around 2 - 3 orders of magnitude better than SpamAssassin) and scales efficiently with increasing community size and GKs. I...|$|R
