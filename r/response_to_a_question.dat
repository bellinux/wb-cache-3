5|$|Carrie Prejean started {{volunteering}} {{with the}} San Diego chapter of JC's Girls in 2008 and became Miss California USA the following year. At the Miss USA 2009 competition, Prejean became {{the subject of}} a controversy because of her <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> about same-sex marriage. Scher said that the controversy would not affect Prejean's involvement with the organization and that the issue of same-sex marriage was not relevant to the group's activities. Prejean said that in volunteering with JC's Girls, she encountered pornographic models who, through exploitation and abuse, had developed very low self-esteem but who had regained a sense of their own dignity because of their interaction with JC's Girls volunteers.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June, and in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about {{government}} spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil {{the government was}} committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to mental health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued {{for the restoration of}} €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the money would be used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal mental health services.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in Salinas v. Texas, 570 U.S. ___ (2013), on June 17, 2013, holding that a suspect's silence {{in response to}} a specific question posed during an interview with police when the suspect was not in custody and the suspect had been voluntarily answering other questions during that interview could be used against him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence in response to the specific question. Of the five justices who concluded that the suspect's silence could be used against him in these circumstances, Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy concluded that the defendant's Fifth Amendment claim failed because he did not expressly invoke the privilege. The other two Justices, Thomas and Scalia, concluded that the defendant's claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege, on the theory that the prosecutor's comment at the trial—regarding the defendant's silence in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> during the police interview—did not compel the defendant to give self-incriminating testimony.|$|E

25|$|The later geonim did not {{restrict}} {{themselves to}} the Mishnah and Talmud, but used the decisions and responsa of their predecessors, whose sayings and traditions were generally regarded as authoritative. These responsa of the later geonim were often essays on Talmudic themes, and since a single letter often answered many questions, it frequently became book-length in size. Two important examples of such books are the Siddur of Amram Gaon, addressed to the Jews of Spain in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> about the laws of prayer, and the Epistle of Sherira Gaon, which sets out {{the history of the}} Mishnah and the Talmud in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> from Tunisia.|$|E

25|$|Some New Zealanders {{will often}} reply to a {{question}} with a statement spoken with a rising intonation at the end. This often {{has the effect of}} making their statement sound like another question. There is enough awareness of this that it is seen in exaggerated form in comedy parody of New Zealanders, such as in the Classic 1970s comedy character Lyn Of Tawa. This rising intonation can also be heard at the end of statements, which are not in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> but to which the speaker wishes to add emphasis. High rising terminals are also heard in Australia.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{statistics}} released on October 21, 2010 by the Institute of Sociology of National Academy of Science of Ukraine, positive attitudes towards Russians have been decreasing since 1994.

In Central Ukraine, 30% responded positively (from 60% in 1994); 60% responded positively in Southern Ukraine (from 70% in 1994); and 64% responded positively in Eastern Ukraine (from 75% in 1994). Furthermore, 6-7% of Western Ukrainians would banish Russians entirely from Ukraine, and 7-8% in Central Ukraine responded similarly.

25|$|Bhagwan Gopinath is {{not known}} to have made any formal disciples {{although}} {{he is said to}} have spiritually initiated a few seekers that would come to him seeking his spiritual tutelage. His method of initiation involved sharing his pipe or by transfixing his gaze on them (called drishtipat). He would rarely initiate anyone by word of mouth although that {{is believed to be the}} commonly invoked method of initiation in Hinduism. He is known to have guided seekers based on their spiritual aptitude and receptivity in worshipping either saguna Brahman (God with form) or nirguna Brahman (God without form) and sometimes also help them choose their ideal of worship or veer them towards worshipping guru as Parabrahma (the ultimate reality). Though he would recommend saguna upasana for the beginners, he would eventually veer them towards nirguna upasana. Once in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> by his devotee as to whether saints should render help to people in spiritual and temporal spheres, he is known to have remarked that unlike a muscular animal who can easily swim across the river, a small insect would drown without help so they have to be helped. As such, his devotees gave him the epithet Jagadguru (spiritual guide of humanity).|$|E
25|$|CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, {{who oversaw}} {{a drop of}} 1% in his party's vote share since the 2011 general election, issued a {{statement}} praising democracy for ousting the AKP majority government from power. Despite the CHP claiming {{that it was because}} of them that the AKP failed to win a majority, media commentators claimed that the decrease in their vote and seat share showed that it was in fact the HDP and MHP that had more of an effect on the result. CHP spokesperson Haluk Koç stated that the CHP was now in the most likely position to be included in a coalition, with Kılıçdaroğlu allegedly attempting to form a CHP-MHP minority coalition with outside support from the HDP. Kılıçdaroğlu appeared to have refused to consider a coalition with the AKP. In <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of whether he would resign after presiding over a decrease in the CHP vote, Kılıçdaroğlu refused to comment but claimed that he was perfectly happy with the election result. Despite this, the President of the Turkish Bars Association and CHP member Metin Feyzioğlu stated that a convention should be called due to the poor election result. The drop in the CHP's vote share was largely attributed to CHP voters tactically voting for the HDP to increase the chances of them surpassing the 10% parliamentary threshold.|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of causal {{reasoning}} models {{depends on how}} well the subjects’ causal beliefs are assessed. Elicitation of causal beliefs {{is determined by the}} experimental questions put to subjects. We examined the impact of question formats commonly used in {{causal reasoning}} research on participant’s responses. The results of our experiment (Study 1) demonstrate that both the mean and homogeneity of the responses can be substantially influenced by the type of question (structure induction vs. strength estimation vs. prediction). Study 2 a demonstrates that subjects’ <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> requiring them <b>to</b> predict the effect of a candidate cause can be significantly lower and more heterogeneous than their <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> asking them <b>to</b> diagnose <b>a</b> cause when given an effect. Study 2 b suggests that diagnostic reasoning can strongly benefit from cues relating to temporal precedence of the cause in the question. Finally, we evaluated 16 variations of recent computational models and found the model fitting was substantially influenced by the type of questions. Our results show that future research in causal reasoning should place a high priority on disentangling the effects of question formats from the effects of experimental manipulations, because that will enable comparisons between models of causal reasoning uncontaminated by method artefact...|$|R
