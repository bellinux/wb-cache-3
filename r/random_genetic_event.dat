30|$|Finally, {{the results}} at hand {{allow us to}} {{appraise}} the threshold model {{for the development of}} schizophrenia [18]. It adds that inherited gene mutations [19 – 21] place an individual on a liability scale for the development of this disease. Additional contributors to this scale may include de novo mutations, environment factors and/or epigenetic [22] events, most occurring during ontogenic development [23]. The model predicts that the liability threshold may be met by inherited factors alone or require additional <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> and epigenetic <b>events</b> including environmental events during development. We propose that this model can be tested using MZ twins discordant for schizophrenia with the assumption that inherited components will be shared between twins. Further, additional de novo mutations (and epimutations) will be acquired during ontogeny in the affected but not in unaffected twin. Given high heterogeneity of the disease, such results across MZD twin pairs may follow similar pattern but differ in the genes affected. Further, the genes affected may belong to a number of common pathways that appear to be invariably affected in this complex disease. Finally, the genes identified in this research are known to be involved in post-synaptic complexes [24] and synaptic strength [25], processes that are known to be defective in several but not all patients with schizophrenia.|$|R

We establish a new concept of a global solution for the diffu-sion approximation (Fokker–Planck equation), prove its existence and uniqueness and then show how one can easily derive all the essential properties of this <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> drift process from our solution.

Whether or not the ultimate fate of a given mtDNA haplotype is determined by <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> drift depends on Nf {{as well as on the}} relative fitnesses.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection, the neutral theory emphasizes the great importance of <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> drift (due to finite population size) and mutation pressure as the main causes of molecular evolution. In this paper, after {{a brief review of}} the neutral theory, recent data strongly supporting the neutral theory are presented. Also discussed are such topics as compensatory neutral evolution and an approach to a unified understanding of molecular and phenotypic evolution.

40|$|If {{only a few}} cysts {{are sampled}} from a large {{population}} and reproduced elsewhere, then the new isolated population may not be genetically representative of the original population. This phenomenon is called <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> drift. The susceptibility of a cultivar to the new population could be significantly different from that to the original population. This deviation has been quantified for potato cyst nematodes via derivation of statistical equations. The standard deviation σ, caused by <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> drift, is inversely proportional to the square root {{of the number of}} cysts sampled, decreases at increasing mating frequency per female, and attains its highest values at intermediate levels of cultivar susceptibility to the original population. Relative susceptibility of a cultivar is the reproduction factor P 1 /P 2 on this cultivar relative to that on a susceptible reference cultivar, at a low inoculum density. If only one cyst is taken, then σ- equals 20 - 30 % at a relative susceptibility to the original population of 20 - 80 %, under assumptions given in the text. If more than 10 cysts are drawn, then σ is lower than 9 %. Increasing the mating frequency from one to 25 decreases the <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> drift by approximately the same extent as doubling the number of cysts per sample. Virulence based on two independent genes hardly changes drift compared to monogenic virulence. If the number of eggs per cyst is lower than 15, then additional <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> drift arises. The results of this study may be used to judge how many cysts are needed in a sample to keep the sampling error sufficiently small, and for investigations on founder effects...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that for certain {{lineages}} noncoding DNA expansion is a consequence of the increased <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> drift associated with long-term escalations in organism size. But a lack of data has prevented the investigation of this hypothesis in most plastid-bearing protists. Here, using newly sequenced mitochondrial and plastid genomes, we explore the relationship between organelle DNA noncoding content and organism size within volvocine green algae. By looking at unicellular, colonial, and differentiated multicellular algae, we show that organelle DNA complexity scales positively with species size and cell number across the volvocine lineage. Moreover, silent-site genetic diversity data suggest that the volvocine species with the largest cell numbers and most bloated organelle genomes have the smallest effective population sizes. Together, these findings support the view that non-adaptive processes, like <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> drift, promote the expansion of noncoding regions in organelle genomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} {{biological}} information is an unexplained phenomenon. Prior research in resolving {{the origin of}} proteins, {{based on the assumption}} that the first genes were contiguous prokaryotic sequences has not succeeded. Rather, it has been established that contiguous protein-coding genes do not exist in practically any amount of <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> sequences. We found that complex eukaryotic proteins could be inherently encoded in split genes that could exist by chance within mere micrograms to milligrams of random DNA. Using protein amino acid sequence variability, codon degeneracy, and stringent exon-length restriction, we demonstrate that split genes for proteins of extant eukaryotes occur extensively in <b>random</b> <b>genetic</b> sequences. The results provide evidence that an abundance of split genes encoding advanced proteins in a small amount of prebiotic genetic material could have ignited the evolution of the eukaryotic genome...|$|R
