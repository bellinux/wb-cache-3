40|$|The <b>RAG</b> 1 and <b>RAG</b> 2 {{proteins}} initiate V(D) J recombination {{by introducing}} double-strand breaks {{at the border}} between a recombination signal sequence (RSS) and a coding segment. To understand the distinct functions of <b>RAG</b> 1 and <b>RAG</b> 2 in signal recognition, we have compared the DNA binding activities of <b>RAG</b> 1 alone and <b>RAG</b> 1 plus <b>RAG</b> 2 by gel retardation and footprinting analyses. <b>RAG</b> 1 exhibits only a three- to fivefold preference for binding DNA containing an RSS over random sequence DNA. Although direct binding of <b>RAG</b> 2 by itself was not detected, the presence of both <b>RAG</b> 1 and <b>RAG</b> 2 results {{in the formation of}} a <b>RAG</b> 1 -RAG 2 -DNA complex which is more stable and more specific than the <b>RAG</b> 1 -DNA complex and is active in V(D) J cleavage. These results suggest that biologically effective discrimination between an RSS and nonspecific sequences requires both <b>RAG</b> 1 and <b>RAG</b> 2. Unlike the binding of <b>RAG</b> 1 plus <b>RAG</b> 2, <b>RAG</b> 1 can bind to DNA {{in the absence of a}} divalent metal ion and does not require the presence of coding flank sequence. Footprinting of the <b>RAG</b> 1 -RAG 2 complex with 1, 10 -phenanthroline-copper and dimethyl sulfate protection reveal that both the heptamer and the nonamer are involved. The nonamer is protected, with extensive protein contacts within the minor groove. Conversely, the heptamer is rendered more accessible to chemical attack, suggesting that binding of <b>RAG</b> 1 plus <b>RAG</b> 2 distorts the DNA near the coding/signal border...|$|R

40|$|Developing B and T {{lymphocytes}} must {{rearrange the}} genomic sequence of antigen receptor genes by V(D) J recombination. The lymphocyte-specific endonuclease <b>RAG,</b> composed of <b>Rag</b> 1 and <b>Rag</b> 2, initiates this process by cleaving specific sites within antigen receptor loci. <b>RAG</b> expression {{must be carefully}} regulated to ensure that V(D) J recombination occurs only under appropriate circumstances. The Bassing laboratory has previously demonstrated that Igκ locus cleavage by <b>RAG</b> in pre-B cells initiates a feedback-inhibition signal suppressing <b>RAG</b> expression. Here, we show that DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced {{by a variety of}} genotoxic agents have a similar effect in suppressing mRNA expression of <b>Rag</b> 1 and <b>Rag</b> 2. This effect can be observed in pro-B cells, pre-B cells, and DN thymocytes, but is not found in DP thymocytes. Using primary pre-B cells as a model system, we show that DSBs activate ATM and Nemo to rapidly suppress transcription of <b>Rag</b> 1 and <b>Rag</b> 2. In pre-B cells, loss of <b>Rag</b> 1 and <b>Rag</b> 2 mRNA expression leads to loss of <b>Rag</b> 1 protein, but <b>Rag</b> 2 protein is more stable and persists in the absence of <b>Rag</b> 2 mRNA. Suppression of <b>Rag</b> 1 expression by DSBs is associated with suppressed RAG-mediated cleavage of the Igκ locus or an artificial recombination substrate in Abelson-transformed pre-B cells. However, simply over-expressing <b>Rag</b> 1 does not allow cells to complete V(D) J recombination in the presence of DSBs, suggesting that other factors may also play a role in suppressing V(D) J recombination. Parallel studies indicate that that RAG-induced DSBs created during V(D) J recombination activate this suppressive signal to enforce allelic exclusion of IgH, TCRβ, and Igκ antigen receptor proteins. We discuss the importance of <b>Rag</b> 1 and <b>Rag</b> 2 suppression in the context of allelic exclusion and propose a role in maintaining genomic stability of developing B and T lymphocytes. ...|$|R

To identify potential functions for noncore regions and assess functionality of core <b>RAG</b> 1 in vivo, we generated core <b>RAG</b> 1 knockin (<b>RAG</b> 1 c/c) mice. Significant B and T cell numbers are generated in <b>RAG</b> 1 c/c mice, showing that core <b>RAG</b> 1, despite missing � 40 % of the <b>RAG</b> 1 sequence, retains significant in vivo function. However, lymphocyte development and the overall level of V(D) J recombination are impaired at the progenitor stage in <b>RAG</b> 1 c/c mice. Correspondingly, there are reduced numbers of peripheral <b>RAG</b> 1 c/c B and T lymphocytes. Whereas normal B lymphocytes undergo rearrangement of both JH loci, substantial levels of germline JH loci persist in mature B cells of <b>RAG</b> 1 c/c mice, demonstrating that DJH rearrangement on both IgH alleles is not required for developmental progression to the stage of VH to DJH recombination. Whereas VH to DJH rearrangements occur, albeit at reduced levels, on the nonselected alleles of <b>RAG</b> 1 c/c B cells that have undergone D to JH rearrangements, we do not detect VH to DH rearrangements in <b>RAG</b> 1 c/c B cells that retain germline JH alleles.

The nucleotide sequence of the cloned <b>RAG</b> 5 gene indicated that it encodes a protein that is homologous to hexokinases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. <b>rag</b> 5 mutants showed no detectable hexokinase or glucokinase activity, suggesting that the sugar kinase activity encoded by this gene is the only hexokinase in K. lactis.

40|$|The <b>Rag</b> 1 and <b>Rag</b> 2 {{proteins}} initiate V(D) J recombination {{by introducing}} site-specific DNA double-strand breaks.

A similar reaction allows <b>Rag</b> transposition, in which the 3 ′-OH groups produced by <b>Rag</b> cleavage are joined to target DNA.

40|$|Abstract Background Functional {{immunoglobulin}} and T {{cell receptor}} genes are produced in developing lymphocytes by V(D) J recombination. The initial site-specific DNA cleavage steps {{in this process}} are catalyzed by the V(D) J recombinase, consisting of <b>RAG</b> 1 and <b>RAG</b> 2, which is directed to appropriate DNA cleavage sites by recognition of the conserved recombination signal sequence (RSS). <b>RAG</b> 1 contains both the active site and the RSS binding domains, although <b>RAG</b> 2 is also required for DNA cleavage activity. An understanding of the physicochemical properties of the <b>RAG</b> proteins, their association, and their interaction with the RSS is not yet well developed. Results Here, we further our investigations into the self-association properties of <b>RAG</b> 1 by demonstrating that {{despite the presence of}} multiple <b>RAG</b> 1 oligomers, only the dimeric form maintains the ability to interact with <b>RAG</b> 2 and the RSS. However, facile aggregation of the dimeric form at physiological temperature may render this protein inactive in the absence of <b>RAG</b> 2. Upon addition of <b>RAG</b> 2 at 37 °C, the preferentially stabilized V(D) J recombinase:RSS complex contains a single dimer of <b>RAG</b> 1. Conclusion Together these results confirm that the functional form of <b>RAG</b> 1 in V(D) J recombination is in the dimeric state, and that its stability under physiological conditions likely requires complex formation with <b>RAG</b> 2. Additionally, in future structural and functional studies of <b>RAG</b> 1, it will be important {{to take into account the}} temperature-dependent self-association properties of <b>RAG</b> 1 described in this study. </p...|$|R

40|$|Expression of the {{recombination}} activating genes <b>Rag</b> 1 and <b>Rag</b> 2 (<b>Rag)</b> {{is essential}} for generation of a diverse B cell antigen receptor repertoire necessary for effective adaptive immune responses. The <b>Rag</b> genes are among the first lineage-specific genes expressed in lymphocyte progenitors, and their expression strongly correlates with commitment to the B lineage. Because V(D) J recombination involves generation of DNA breaks by the <b>RAG</b> proteins, <b>Rag</b> expression must be tightly controlled throughout B cell development to maintain genomic integrity. Using Abelson Murine Leukemia Virus-transformed B cells as a model system, we sought to identify factors that repress <b>Rag</b> transcription during pre-B cell differentiation, a period of B cell development marked by rapid proliferation during which the <b>Rag</b> genes are transiently repressed and then reactivated upon differentiation. A screen identified Ebf 1 and c-Myb, two well-studied transcription factors {{in the context of}} early B cell development, as repressors of <b>Rag</b> transcription in these highly proliferative cells. As we found no evidence for direct <b>Rag</b> repression by Ebf 1, we investigated how Ebf 1 influences the expression of factors previously implicated in the regulation <b>Rag</b> transcription. We discovered that Ebf 1 achieves <b>Rag</b> repression through both negative regulation of the <b>Rag</b> activator Foxo 1, and positive regulation of the <b>Rag</b> repressor Gfi 1 b. In addition to influencing Foxo 1 and Gfi 1 b expression in a similar manner, we found that c-Myb directly binds to the Erag enhancer in the <b>Rag</b> locus and antagonizes Foxo 1 binding to this cis regulatory element. Together this work reveals previously unappreciated roles for Ebf 1 and c-Myb in the transcriptional repression of the <b>Rag</b> genes during pre-B cell differentiation. In addition to screening for factors that regulate <b>Rag</b> expression during B cell development, we also performed a screen for factors capable of activating the <b>Rag</b> genes in non-lymphoid cells. Given the close connection between <b>Rag</b> expression and B lineage commitment in lymphocyte progenitors, we reasoned that if we were able to induce <b>Rag</b> transcription in non-lymphoid cells such as fibroblast, these cells might be activating a host of B cell-specific genes and undergoing direct reprogramming to the B lineage. While we identified factors that could readily induce <b>Rag</b> expression when overexpressed in primary fibroblasts, we could detect no evidence of a reprogramming event involving activation of additional B lineage genes. Together our work identified novel repressors of <b>Rag</b> transcription in developing B cells, and factors capable of activating <b>Rag</b> transcription in non-lymphoid cells that may inform future fibroblast-to-B cell reprogramming experiments...|$|R

Here we use UV cross-linking to define sequence- and site-specific interactions between <b>RAG</b> 1 protein and both the heptamer element of the RSS and the coding flank DNA.
