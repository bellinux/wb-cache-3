25|$|The {{main event}} and the semi-main event both {{stemmed from the}} same storyline, pitting the team of Los Guerreros del Infierno (Último Guerrero and Rey Bucanero) against the tecnico team of Shocker and Vampiro Canadiense. The storyline started not long after Guerrero and Bucanero {{defeated}} Negro Casas and El Hijo del Santo to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship in mid-2002 and originally centered around Los Guerreros championship, with Shocker and Vampiro chasing the title. The two teams met {{in one of the}} feature matches at the CMLL 69th Anniversary Show where Los Guerreros successfully defended the tag team title. Following the title defense the storyline split into two, with Último Guerrero focusing on Shocker, demanding a match for Shocker's CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship. In the other storyline the feud between Bucanero and Vampiro focused more on a Lucha de Apuestas or bet match challenge. Since neither held a singles championship they would both bet their hair against the outcome of the match and be shaved bald in case they lost. The Luchas de Apuestas match is the most prestigious match type in Lucha Libre, which is why it was chosen over the championship match to main event the show. In the semi-main event Último Guerrero won the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship after forcing Shocker to submit to his own trademark submission hold La Reienera (a Modified spinning backbreaker <b>rack).</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> main event Vampiro gained a measure of revenge for his tag team partner as he defeated Rey Bucanero, pinning him to win the third and deciding fall. Following the match Bucanero's long hair was cut off and then the rest of his hair was shaved off as per the Lucha Libre traditions.|$|E

2500|$|The 1956 {{flag was}} adopted {{in an era}} when the Georgia General Assembly [...] "was entirely devoted to passing {{legislation}} that would preserve segregation and white supremacy", according to a 2000 research report by the Georgia senate. There are few, if any, written records of what was said on the Georgia House and Senate floors when the 1956 flag bill was being introduced and passed by the Georgia legislature, nor does Georgia law provide for a statement of legislative intent when a bill is introduced, although former U.S. Congressman James Mackay, one of the 32 House members who opposed the change, later stated, “There was only one reason for putting the flag on there: like the gun <b>rack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back of a pickup truck, it telegraphs a message." [...] Additionally, the 2000 report concluded that the [...] "1956 General Assembly changed the state flag" [...] during [...] "an atmosphere of preserving segregation and resentment" [...] to the U.S. government's rulings on integration.|$|E
2500|$|Pizza / Mcpizza – McDonald's {{has also}} {{attempted}} pizza at various times, with an apple-pie–like McPizza and more conventional McDonald's Pizza. A line of personal-sized pizzas was first {{seen in the}} late 1970s in test-market stores near interstate highways around Milwaukee and Madison. In Canada (c. 1992–99), the pizza originally began as a family-sized pizza that was brought out to the table by an employee and placed on a raised <b>rack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre of the table. Later it was scaled down to a personal-sized pizza. However, variations have {{found their way into}} some international markets such as India (the pie-like [...] "Pizza McPuff"). McDonald's also test marketed a 14-inch, round, traditional-style pizza in Evansville, Indiana, and nearby Owensboro, Kentucky, in 1989. By 1991, the McDonald's test markets for pizza had grown to over 500 McDonald's locations before the pizza test was placed on hold. Pizza was discontinued in most restaurants by 2000. The reason for eliminating the pizza from the menu was that the time to cook a pizza took 11 minutes, and McDonald's wanted to keep its reputation for fast service. As of March 2017, two McDonald's locations, one in Pomeroy, Ohio, and the other in Spencer, West Virginia still offer the family style McPizza.|$|E
