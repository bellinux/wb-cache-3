Murray continued, [...] "Ordinarily I'd be griping that this episode was yet another mythology-free time-waster, with a plot that—two-foot-long parasites aside—could be passed along to any other procedural show currently on the air. But I <b>really</b> <b>enjoyed</b> 'Snakehead,' both {{because of the way}} the story reflected who Walter is and because of all the little touches of character development and scene-setting.|$|E
