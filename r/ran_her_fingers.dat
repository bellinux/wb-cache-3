2500|$|In his summing up, the coroner, H.R. Oswald, {{stated that}} Kempton {{was in a}} {{depressed}} state and short of money, [...] "Her life was precarious, and {{she was one of}} those who tried to turn night into day". He doubted the evidence of Chang which contradicted that of Heinberg but thought there was insufficient evidence to bring a charge of manslaughter against Chang. After deliberating, the jury returned a verdict of suicide whilst temporarily insane, at which, according to the News of the World, [...] "Chang smiled broadly and quickly left the court. As he passed out, several well-dressed girls patted his shoulder, while one <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through his hair".|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Hay Denver <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> {{through his}} grizzled hair. [...] "It {{was when you}} came back in the Antelope, just before you got your step." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} a {{week she}} {{introduced}} Jeff to her sister-in-law, having previously <b>run</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through his hair to insure that becomingness to his curls which would better indicate his moral character; and spoke of him as one of her oldest Californian friends.|$|R

60|$|There {{follows the}} {{well-known}} supper scene. Lady Cicely is very gay. She pours champagne into Mr. Harding's glass. They both drink from it. She asks {{him if he}} is a happy boy now. He says he is. She <b>runs</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through his hair. He kisses her on the bare shoulder. This is also symbolic.|$|R
6000|$|... "You mustn't {{talk like}} this," [...] she said. [...] "You know you mustn't." [...] She {{put her hand}} on his head and <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through the hair he had so ruffled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooty {{deep for}} me, Olly; but," [...] he added, hastily, {{with a glance}} at her alarmed face, [...] "don't you mind, I'll come out all safe. Good-bye." [...] He kissed her tenderly. She <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through his sandy curls, deftly {{smoothed}} his beard, and reknotted his neckerchief.|$|E
6000|$|Olly came back. [...] "You ole Gabe--you!" [...] {{she said}} patronisingly, as she <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through his tangled curls, and stooped to bestow {{a kiss on}} his {{forehead}} from an apparently immeasurable moral and intellectual height--"You old big Gabe, {{what would you do}} without me, I'd like to know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She made no answer. She {{walked across}} the room to the piano and began to play, rather noisily and rapidly, with odd gusts of emphasis, the shepherd's pipe music from the last act in [...] "Tristan and Isolde." [...] Presently she missed a note, failed again, <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> heavily up the scale, struck the piano passionately with her fist, making a feeble jar in the treble, jumped up, and went out of the room....|$|R
60|$|She {{was close}} in her husband's arms; {{she clung to}} him; {{whatever}} of strangeness and slowness and insularity she might find in him, none of that mattered so {{long as she could}} slip her hands beneath his coat, <b>run</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> over the warm smoothness of the satin back of his waistcoat, seem almost to creep into his body, find in him strength, find in the courage and kindness of her man a shelter from the perplexing world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I doubt that," [...] {{said the}} old wise woman. Nevertheless, she saw that Hans was set in his own way, and that he only talked {{stiffness}} into his stubbornness. So she arose from her chair with much groaning, for her joints were stiffened with age, and limping to a closet in the wall she brought a book thence. Then she <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> down one page and up another, until she had found that which she sought. When she had found it she spoke: ...|$|R
60|$|He did so obediently, but wonderingly. She {{then opened}} the piano and took a seat upon the music stool before it, placed some loose sheets of music in the rack, and <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> lightly over the keys. Thus intrenched, she let her hands fall idly in her lap, {{and for the first}} time raised her eyes to his.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't if I was you," [...] said Mr. Decker {{with a sigh}} of relief. After a pause, he took a seat on the sofa, and, {{drawing his}} wife to his side, said, [...] "Do you know what I was {{thinking}} of when you came in, Elsie?" [...] Mrs. Decker <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through his stiff black hair, and couldn't imagine.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little girl}} had, with {{infinite}} pains, contrived to learn two [...] "pieces" [...] which she usually executed with a jerky movement {{of her right}} hand and a left hand that forgot to keep up and so made dreadful discords. But {{under the influence of}} the chocolate bonbon she sat down and <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> lightly over the keys producing such exquisite harmony that she was filled with amazement at her own performance.|$|E
500|$|Suddenly embarrassed, the Tramp {{starts to}} shuffle away, {{but the girl}} steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts. She takes hold {{of his hand and}} presses the coin into it. As she closes his palm she stops abruptly; her smile turns to a look of puzzlement. She <b>runs</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then catches her breath: [...] "You?" [...] The Tramp nods with an {{uncertain}} smile and asks, [...] "You can see now?" [...] The girl replies, [...] "Yes, I can see now" [...] and tearfully pulls his hand to her bosom. The uncertainty on the Tramp's face turns to joy as the film fades to black.|$|R
50|$|Nuliajuk {{lives in}} the ocean {{for a very long}} time. Nuliajuk just sits on the ocean floor, her long hair flowing, moving back and forth with the tides and the currents. When you look down into the sea over the side of a boat in summer, you can see her hair, swaying back and forth. Sometimes as her hair moves with the water, it gets all disheveled and tangled up. The creatures of the sea get caught in it and no matter how hard they try they cannot get out. It would be so nice if Nuliajuk can <b>run</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through <b>her</b> hair and let all these animals out, but Nuliajuk has no fingers.|$|R

6000|$|There was no applause {{when the}} air ceased, but a deep sigh from every one {{seemed to be the}} {{indication}} of a return to ordinary consciousness. Waboose and her mother did not sigh, however. They sat still and gazed in silent wonder. Jessie Macnab, with a slight blush at the unexpected effect, <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> lightly over the keys of her instrument, and then suddenly began to play a Highland reel with tremendous vigour! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall have}} a fine day to-morrow," [...] said Christopher with complacency, and he sat himself {{on the floor at}} her feet, and leant his back against her knees, and {{stretched}} out his long stockinged legs to the fire--all signs that he felt no longer any restraint at the presence of the stranger. He was the youngest of the family, and Mary's favorite, partly because his character resembled hers, as Edward's character resembled Elizabeth's. She made her knees a comfortable rest for his head, and <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through his hair.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had managed}} to {{progress}} {{a little in the}} acquisition of a knowledge of her tongue, so that I knew many of the animals and reptiles by their Caspakian names, and trees and ferns and grasses. I knew the words for sea and river and cliff, for sky and sun and cloud. Yes, I was getting along finely, and then {{it occurred to me that}} I didn't know my companion's name; so I pointed to myself and said, [...] "Tom," [...] and to her and raised my eyebrows in interrogation. The girl <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> into that mass of hair and looked puzzled. I repeated the action a dozen times.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{all there}} in there," [...] waving her hand towards the hut. [...] "Out {{here in the}} wood it is all gone--like this," [...] and stooping quickly, she raised a little yellow sand on her palm, then let it <b>run</b> away through <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Conroy {{approached}} her lord and master, and <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> thin, claw-like <b>fingers</b> {{through his hair}} with married audacity. He caught them, held them for {{a moment with a}} kindly, caressing, and yet slightly embarrassed air that the lady did not like. She withdrew them quickly.|$|R
500|$|In February 1992, Al Rendon {{was hired}} by EMI Latin to take {{photographs}} for Entre a Mi Mundo. A previous photographer had taken some photos of the singer, which were not well received by the company, and Rendon was asked to do a [...] "quick session". Rendon rented a studio and hired John MacBurney—whom Abraham constany argued with—to do the makeup. MacBurney [...] "privately complained" [...] to EMI Latin that Abraham was difficult to deal with. Rendon and MacBurney, however, found Selena [...] "real easy to work with". Selena picked out the outfit for herself to wear in the cover picture; this outfit included a black top with a mesh see-through midriff, a long-sleeve black jacket with black-and-white striped long sleeves, a wide black leather belt, and tight black pants. She chose a pose where she <b>runs</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through <b>her</b> hair, a pose that Abraham was noticeably bothered with. In 1998, the outfit that she wore for the album cover was added to a museum that her family operates in Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|R
6000|$|Anne {{could stand}} no longer. She took the offered chair. Mrs. Glenarm resumed her {{place on the}} music-stool, and <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> idly over the keys of the piano. [...] "Where did you see Mr. Delamayn?" [...] she went on. [...] "The most irresponsible of men, except when he has got his fiddle in his hand! Is he coming in soon? Are {{we going to have}} any music? Have you come to play with us? Mr. Delamayn is a perfect fanatic in music, isn't he? Why isn't he here to {{introduce}} us? I suppose you like the classical style, too? Did you know that I was in the music-room? Might I ask your name?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Tretherick assented. Carry {{flew into}} the next room, and {{presently}} re-appeared, dragging a small trunk, into which she gravely proceeded to pack her clothes. Mrs. Tretherick noticed {{that they were not}} many. A question or two regarding them brought out some further replies from the child; and, before many minutes had elapsed, Mrs. Tretherick was in possession of all her earlier history. But, to do this, Mrs. Tretherick had been obliged to take Carry upon her lap, pending the most confidential disclosures. They sat thus a long time after Mrs. Tretherick had apparently ceased to be interested in Carry's disclosures; and, when lost in thought, she allowed the child to rattle on unheeded, and <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through the scarlet curls.|$|E
60|$|She re-entered the sitting-room, {{shut the}} door {{carefully}} and locked it, half pulled down the blind, walking once or twice around the table on which the parcel lay, with one eye on it like a graceful cat. Then she suddenly sat down, took {{it up with a}} grave practical face, examined the postmark curiously, and opened it with severe deliberation. It contained a manuscript and a letter of four closely written pages. She glanced at the manuscript with bright approving eyes, <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through its leaves and then laid it carefully and somewhat ostentatiously on the table beside her. Then, still holding the letter in her hand, she rose and glanced out of the window at her bored brother lounging towards the beach and at the heaving billows beyond, and returned to her seat. This apparently important preliminary concluded, she began to read.|$|E
25|$|One {{method to}} confirm that the bra is the best fit has been nicknamed the Swoop and Scoop. After {{identifying}} a well-fitting bra, the woman bends forward (the swoop), allowing their breasts to fall into the bra, filling the cup naturally, and then fastening the bra on the outermost set of hooks. When the woman stands up, she uses the opposite hand to place each breast gently into the cup (the scoop), and she then <b>runs</b> <b>her</b> index <b>finger</b> along the inside top edge of the bra cup to make sure her breast tissue does not spill over the edges.|$|R
6000|$|... "He stays out so late—up at the Ram Inn," [...] {{whispered the}} {{mother in a}} high whisper, looking at George, [...] "and then he's up at five—he doesn't get his proper rest." [...] She turned to the chicks, and {{continued}} in her whisper—"the mother left them just before they hatched out, so we've been bringing them on here. This one's a bit weak—I thought I'd hot him up a bit" [...] she laughed with a quaint little frown of deprecation. Eight or nine yellow, fluffy little mites were cheeping and scuffling in the fender. Lettie bent over them to touch them; they were tame, and <b>ran</b> among <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Bree becomes {{excited when}} Susan and Julie {{move in and}} {{attempts}} to make Danielle feel the same. Danielle is concerned since Andrew left and that Bree is acting weird. When Danielle tells Bree that she forgot her birthday, Bree wants to throw her a 17th birthday and invite her friends. Danielle reluctantly gives in but wants Andrew's room in return. The following morning, Bree over decorates the house with balloons with the number [...] "17". Danielle asks that Bree take them down since she wants a simple party. Bree then begins to pop the balloons by stabbing them which concerns Susan. At Danielle's birthday party, Bree comes to a melting point when one of Danielle's friends <b>runs</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> through the birthday cake's frosting after she {{worked so hard to}} make it perfect. Bree causes a scene and embarrasses everybody, including herself. Danielle runs out of the party in tears. Danielle later finds out where Matthew is when she enters the Applewhites' basement through a cellar door. They then plan an escape when Betty returns to feed him. As Betty comes down the stairs, Danielle comes behind and hits her with a crowbar and steals the key. Danielle then writes a letter to Bree informing her that she has run away with Matthew and is unlikely to return. Bree then checks herself into a mental institution because she feels {{on the verge of a}} nervous breakdown.|$|R
60|$|Elsie, in the meantime, {{had left}} the house and crept round it on the grass until she reached a {{greenhouse}} built against {{one side of the}} drawing-room. The door was open, as she had expected, and, feeling for the edge of a flower-stand, she followed it up until she could crouch down beside the steps leading to a French window. It was closed but not latched, for when she <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> along the joint, she felt an aperture; but she dared not try to pull it open. Still, she could see in. The lamps had not been lighted, but an electric torch lay on the table and threw a ring of light on the opposite wall, two or three feet from the ground. The rest of the room was in darkness, but a dim illumination which spread beyond the bright beam showed two figures faintly.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pendyce {{had read}} the letter now three times, and instinctively had {{put it in her}} bosom. It was not hers, but Horace must know it by heart, and in his anger he might tear it up. That letter, for which they had waited so long; told her nothing; she had known all there was to tell. Her hand had fallen from Mr. Pendyce's shoulder, and she did not put it back, but <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through and through each other, while the sunlight, {{traversing}} the narrow windows, caressed her from her hair down to her knees. Here and there that stream of sunlight formed little pools in her eyes, giving them a touching, anxious brightness; in a curious heart-shaped locket of carved steel, worn by her mother and her grandmother before her, containing now, not locks of their son's hair, but a curl of George's; in her diamond rings, and a bracelet of amethyst and pearl which she wore for the love of pretty things. And the warm sunlight disengaged from her a scent of lavender. Through the library door a scratching noise told that the dear dogs knew she was not in her bedroom. Mr. Pendyce, too, caught that scent of lavender, and in some vague way it augmented his discomfort. Her silence, too, distressed him. It did not occur to him that his silence was distressing her. He put down his pen.|$|E
50|$|Time passed, and Shakuntala, {{wondering}} why Dushyanta {{did not return}} for her, finally {{set out for the}} capital city with her foster father and some of her companions. On the way, they had to cross a river by a canoe ferry and, seduced by the deep blue waters of the river, Shakuntala <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through the water. Her ring (Dushyanta's ring) slipped off her finger without her realizing it.|$|E
5000|$|In Batman Forever (1995), the Batsuit is {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} previous two films costumes, except for the focus on a more anatomical design overall and a black utility belt instead of a yellow one. The [...] "ears" [...] on the cowl are also longer. One notable feature of the costume is {{a button on the}} utility belt which causes a fireproof coating to excrete from and cover the cape, allowing Batman to wrap it around himself as a shield from extreme fires, and a more 3-D bat emblem on his chest, but resembles the chest symbol from Batman Returns. Also like in Batman Returns, Bruce has numerous spares which he keeps in a large dome-like structure in the Batcave of this film. Dr. Chase Meridian, the films love interest for Batman, mentions the appeal of Batmans suit as she <b>runs</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> across the chest section. After all of the regular Batsuits are destroyed by the Riddler, Bruce wears a prototype [...] "Sonar Suit", which is an iridescent silvery-black and more armor-like. This new Batsuit utilizes lenses that slide automatically over the cowls eyeholes to display a sonar-generated image of Batmans surroundings to him, allowing him to see with more accuracy in extreme darkness or glare. The use of this suit in the climax of the film, allows Batman to smash the Riddlers Box-device and save both Robin and Dr Meridian, which otherwise would have been impossible with the standard Batsuit. The Batsuits in this film were created from a less dense mixture of foam rubber, which resulted in much lighter suits and allowed more flexibility for Val Kilmer and the various stunt doubles, while increasing durability. More than 100 Batman and Robin costumes were created to allow for the range of stunts, from underwater scenes to scenes involving fire and extreme fighting. The [...] "sonar" [...] Batsuit was subsequently used by Christopher Nolan when auditioning actors for the lead role in Batman Begins, and was worn by Christian Bale and Cillian Murphy among others.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{forced to}} support themselves, the sisters {{decided to keep}} school genteelly, and, hearing {{that there was an}} opening in Thrums, they settled there, and Miss Kitty brushed her hair out now, and with a twist and a twirl <b>ran</b> it up <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> into a net, whence by noon some of it had escaped through the little windows and was curls again. She and Miss Ailie were happy in Thrums, for time took the pain out of the affair of Mr. McLean, until it became not merely a romantic memory, but, with the letters he wrote to Miss Kitty and her answers, the great quiet {{pleasure}} of their lives. They were friendly letters only, but Miss Kitty wrote hers out in pencil first and read them to Miss Ailie, who had been taking notes for them.|$|R
60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Gerald, {{come near}} to me. Quite close to me, as {{you used to}} do when you were a little boy, when you were mother's own boy. [GERALD sits down betide his mother. She <b>runs</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> through his hair, and strokes his hands.] Gerald, there was a girl once, she was very young, she was little over {{eighteen}} at the time. George Harford - that was Lord Illingworth's name then - George Harford met her. She knew nothing about life. He - knew everything. He made this girl love him. He made her love him so much that she left her father's house with him one morning. She loved him so much, and he had promised to marry her! He had solemnly promised to marry her, and she had believed him. She was very young, and - and ignorant of what life really is. But he put the marriage off from week to week, and month to month. - She trusted in him all the while. She loved him. - Before her child was born - for she had a child - she implored him for the child's sake to marry her, that the child might have a name, that her sin might not be visited on the child, who was innocent. He refused. After the child was born she left him, taking the child away, and her life was ruined, and her soul ruined, and all that was sweet, and good, and pure in her ruined also. She suffered terribly - she suffers now. She will always suffer. For her there is no joy, no peace, no atonement. She is a woman who drags a chain like a guilty thing. She is a woman who wears a mask, like a thing that is a leper. The fire cannot purify her. The waters cannot quench her anguish. Nothing can heal her! no anodyne can give her sleep! no poppies forgetfulness! She is lost! She is a lost soul! - That is why I call Lord Illingworth a bad man. That is why I don't want my boy to be with him.|$|R
