40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports the}} {{investigation}} of jatropha curcas seeds oil as an alternative option to replace mineral oil in power transformers. This product has several advantages that recommend both its production and usage over that of other vegetable oils as crude palm <b>oil</b> and <b>rape-seeds</b> <b>oil</b> because it may be grown on marginal or degraded soils thus avoiding the need to utilize those more fertile soils currently being used by smallholders to grow their staple crops; and it will readily grow in areas where annual rainfall levels are significantly lower than those required by other species such as <b>oil</b> palm, <b>rape-seeds</b> <b>oil,</b> sunflower oil, soybeans oil, corn oil and others. For instance, these plants can be grown on all soil types in Indonesia, even on barren soil. The barren soil types {{can be found in}} many parts of eastern Indonesia that remain untapped because of the difficulty planted with other crops. Moreover, jatropha curcas oil is non-food crops. Jatropha curcas oil is processed by alkali base catalyzed esterification process using potassium hydroxide (KOH) to produce jatropha curcas methyl ester oil (JMEO) that is a product the viscosity and acidity are acceptable for high voltage equipment especially in power transformer. The physicochemical (water content, viscosity, acidity [...] .) and electrical (dielectric strength) properties of JMEO were measured.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of substituting mineral oils by biodegradable oils. After the analysis of properties and possibilities of the use of <b>rape-seed</b> <b>oils</b> of HETG type, it is stated that these oils show generally very low thermooxidation stability. One of the possibilities of dealing with the pre-sent conditions which corresponds to the Czech governmental programme of useful, economic but above all ecological solution of oil waste problems according to Law No. 125 / 97 Gaz. on wastes and its novella No. 167 / 98 Gaz. is the collection and subsequent recycling of <b>oils</b> on the <b>rape-seed</b> base. The objective is to improve thermooxidation stability of the oils. A basic idea con-sists in an assumption that through thermal load, considerable amount of dou-ble bonds decreased the bonds being the basic source of polymerization reac-tions, in other words thermooxidation instability of oil. Such an oil, under con-ditions of observing other important physical and chemical parameters, can be used after recycling as a filling for gearboxes or less loaded hydraulic systems of forest machines fulfilling strict requirements of Czech laws concerning for-est protection. Results are presented of service life tests of raffinates and recy-cled oils. Comparisons with the behaviour of commonly recommended oils show that recycled oils rank among types of <b>rape-seed</b> <b>oils</b> with average prop-erties. However, the thermooxidation stability of the oil was substantially improved, peroxide number was constant and the origin of hardenable poly-merized deposits did not occur...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{recognition}} {{of the importance of}} the long-chain n- 3 PUFA, EPA and DHA, to cardiovascular health, and in the case of DHA to normal neurological development in the fetus and the newborn, has focused greater attention on the dietary supply of these fatty acids. The reason for low intakes of EPA and DHA in most developed countries (0 center dot 1 - 0 center dot 5 hairspg/d) is the low consumption of oily fish, the richest dietary source of these fatty acids. An important question is whether dietary intake of the precursor n- 3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (alpha LNA), can provide sufficient amounts of tissue EPA and DHA by conversion through the n- 3 PUFA elongation-desaturation pathway. alpha LNA is present in marked amounts in plant sources, including green leafy vegetables and commonly-consumed <b>oils</b> such as <b>rape-seed</b> and soyabean <b>oils,</b> so that increased intake of this fatty acid would be easier to achieve than via increased fish consumption. However, alpha LNA-feeding studies and stable-isotope studies using alpha LNA, which have addressed the question of bioconversion of alpha LNA to EPA and DHA, have concluded that in adult men conversion to EPA is limited (approximately 8 %) and conversion to DHA is extremely low (< 0 center dot 1 %). In women fractional conversion to DHA appears to be greater (9 %), which may partly be a result of a lower rate of utilisation of alpha LNA for beta-oxidation in women. However, up-regulation of the conversion of EPA to DHA has also been suggested, as a result of the actions of oestrogen on Delta 6 -desaturase, and may be of particular importance in maintaining adequate provision of DHA in pregnancy. The effect of oestrogen on DHA concentration in pregnant and lactating women awaits confirmation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Biofuels {{represent}} an attractive substitute for classical, fossil fuels with some important advantages such as renewable sources and environmental friendliness. However, the physicochemical characteristics of biofuels {{are different from}} fossil fuels, therefore new technologies have to be developed. One of the most prospective fields {{for the use of}} biofuels is Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production, where new industrial gas turbines provide the needed new technologies. To justify the development of these new technologies and to assess the effects of use of different liquid and gaseous biofuels in CHP production, we have performed a preliminary socio-economic analysis. In this analysis we included liquid biofuels available in EU (<b>rape-seed</b> <b>oil,</b> biodiesel, flash pyrolysis oil) and processes such as gasification from wood, waste methanization and slow pyrolysis for gaseous biofuels. The analysis covers the whole production chain starting from crop production, oil extraction, and biodiesel production to CHP production using various liquid and gaseous biofuels. The most important, preliminary qualitative and quantitative results of the performed socio-economic analysis have been presented...|$|E

Cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine levels in both membranes were altered by diet. Diet fat also affected the microsomal content of sphingomyelin.

Plasma membranes were isolated and the effect of diet fat on the fatty acid composition of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol and sphingomyelin was determined. Diet fat significantly altered total saturated and (omega- 9) and (omega- 6) -unsaturated fatty acid composition in addition to the (omega- 6) - to (omega- 3) -unsaturated fatty acid ratio in these polar lipids. Feeding the high-fat diet increased the (omega- 6) - to (omega- 3) -unsaturated fatty acid ratio and the (omega- 9) -unsaturated fatty acid content in all lipids except sphingomyelin. Assay of glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity at both high and low glucagon concentrations indicated that high-fat intake also decreased cyclic AMP formation. In a second experiment the fat intake was held constant (40 % of energy) and oleic acid was substituted for linoleic acid by blending high- and low-linoleic acid-type safflower oils.

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of {{ischemic heart disease}} (IHD) in Crete was lower than expected {{on the basis of}} blood lipid con-centrations of participants in the Seven Countries Study. A favor-able effect of a high intake of olive oil on thrombogenesis may have contributed to this finding. Objective: We compared the effects of virgin olive oil with those of rapeseed and sunflower oils on blood coagulation factor VII (FVII), a key factor in thrombogenesis. Design: In a randomized and strictly controlled crossover study, 18 healthy young men consumed diets enriched with 5 g/MJ (19 % of total energy) olive oil, sunflower oil, or rapeseed oil for periods of 3 wk. On the final day of each period, participants con-sumed standardized high-fat meals (42 % of energy as fat). Fasting and nonfasting blood samples were collected after each period. Results: Mean (– SEM) nonfasting peak concentrations of acti-vated FVII (FVIIa) were 11. 3 – 5. 1 U/L lower after olive oil than after sunflower oil, an 18 % reduction (P < 0. 05). Olive oil also tended to cause lower FVIIa peak concentrations than did <b>rape-seed</b> <b>oil</b> (mean difference: 8. 6 U/L, a 15 % reduction; P = 0. 09).

40|$|The {{negative}} impact of pollutants in any form to the environment, makes it imperative for mankind to develop systems that shall attain zero emission. Recognizing this {{and to be able}} to contribute in attaining that goal, we at Mie University, are now developing a BDF program towards zero emission in our newly established Iga Integrated Research Institute, Mie, Japan. This paper introduces to you the existing and proposed projects as well as our activities in the institute. 　The Japanese government in 2006 designed and revised “The fundamental policy for biomass utilization” to enhance more effective utilization of biomass to recover energy from the wastes. Major unutilized wastes include among others, livestock excreta, sawmill dusts, logging residues, food residues and sewage. These wastes especially, livestock excreta, sawmill dusts and logging residues abound in rural areas where progress is slow because of underpopulation due to immigration. The Japanese government hopes to be able to address this concern by generating jobs through the establishment of “Biomass Town Project” under the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery (MAFF). The planned project targets the reutilization of more than 90 % of wastes and the effective utilization of more than 40 % of biomass from lumber and forest residues. To support this target, the government had already mobilized more than 300 municipalities all over Japan. However, speciﬁc properties of biomass such as bulkiness and low energy per unit density cause some difﬁculties in their collection and handling. These entail high costs in transporting biomass to other places from generation areas. Utilization of biomass in areas where it was produced will develop and activate the locality through employment generation. It will also relieve other areas from receiving wastes generated elsewhere under the precept, “local production for local consumption. ” This is a good reason to get some public support to construct sustainable society. 　Located northwest of Mie Prefecture, Iga City’s major industry is agriculture, such as, stockbreeding and forestry. Under the “Biomass Town Projects”, Iga City in 2008 proposed to undertake “Rape-seed oil project” (Iga Nanohana project) to the National government in order to attract young people to repopulate the area and reinvigorate the aging population. 　One of essential features of this project is the creation of renewable energy from used vegetable oil and the <b>rape-seed</b> <b>oil</b> as biodiesel fuel (BDF) for agricultural machineries. And unlike the biodisel fuel (BDF) from EU which was synthesized from vegetable oils (sun ﬂower, rape seed), the BDF in Japan is synthesized from kitchen waste oils. This explains the high production of BDF (several thousands liters per cycle) in EU compared to very low production in Japan (average of 100 liters per cycle). The exception is Kyoto City-Hall, a model on the use of BDF from recycled vegetable oils, which produces from 50 ～ 200 L/cycle. 　The BDF processors in Japan are called as “Community scaled BDF-Processor” which are usually enterprising cities, towns and villages or a small business without know-how and technical skills in BDF production. To help Iga City hall make BDF effectively, Mie University and Mie Prefectural Environmental Institute participated in this project starting from the planning stage. This report outlined the Iga-nanohana project and current status of BDF production from the BDF-Processor in local area. 　Currently, we are investigating BDF production from used oil but our future plans include exploration of other BDF sources such as phytoplankton, Jathropa and other potential materials for biofuel production. Taking care of the terrestrial environment through zero emission programs is a step that can be taken to control or even prevent the {{negative impact}} of land-based activities to the coastal environment...|$|E
40|$|Background: Previously, we (HM) {{found that}} most commercially {{available}} edible oils, which were processed by hexane extraction followed {{by a number of}} purification steps, were extremely low in anti-peroxy radical (ROO.), or radical scavenging activity. This is a great contrast to the respective virgin oils as exemplified by extra-virgin olive oil or crude rape seed oil [1 - 4] (Figure 1). Therefore, such highly purified oils will became prooxidant and less desirable food components in terms of health oriented diet. Oxidized oils may eventually cause DNA cleavages, modification of proteins, RNA, and lipids, as well as cellular damage, or promote inflammation and carcinogenesis at later time [5 - 9]. These commercial oils of low antioxidant activity may be improved by adding functionally effective antioxidative components, by using dried vegetable-waste such as tomato-juice-waste-residues and wine-ferment-waste-residues. Their antioxiative components will be transferred into the functionally poor grade edible oils, and consequently, one can improve the quality of such functionally poor oils and thereby contributing human health [2, 8, 9]. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to report a practical procedure to fortify functionally low grade conventional edible oils to functionally enriched edible oils using dried vegetable-waste residues such as tomato juice waste, and wine-ferment-residues, or other vegetable-waste residues. Methods: (1) Preparation and measurements of lycopene and carotenoid enriched oils. To 5. 0 g or 1. 0 g of the dried residue of tomato juice waste, 100 ml of commercial rape seed (canola) oil was added respectively. Each mixture was incubated at room temperature in dark for several weeks. Amount of lycopene and carotenoids extracted into the oil was monitored by increase of absorption (400 - 550 nm) and fluorescence at 470 nm of carotenoid. Grape-juice ferment (wine) waste was similarly prepared after hot air drying, and immersed in canola oil. (2) Evaluation of function-enriched edible oils: Preventive effect of lipid peroxidation; (a) Heat exposure: Commercial <b>rape-seed</b> <b>oil</b> and extra virgin oil were used as controls. For preparation of the test samples (function fortified oils) of tomato-juice waste-residue and grape wine- ferment waste-residues, it is described in above section (1). All oil preparations were exposed to high temperature at 150 oC and peroxide value (POV), acid value and TBARS were measured at various times as described. The methods of measurements of POV, acid value and TBARS were adapted conventional standard method described elsewhere. (b) Light exposure: Similar to (a) they were exposed to excessive light using Nippon Ikaga Kikai (Tokyo), LH- 200 -RDS equipped with fluorescent light tube (x 3), NEC FL 40 S- 2 XN, 3. 2 K lux at 390 - 730 nm. Result and Discussions: (1) Extraction of carotenoids etc. Modern edible oil refining processes are highly elaborated and efficient. The most of the commercial edible oils in the market are so purified that many important antioxidant components are mostly removed during refining process. Oils became mostly colorless and odorless; and they lack are devoid of anti-oxidative or radical scavenging components. We measured anti-alkyl peroxy radical (ROO.) -scavenging activity, and found that many commercial oils have very little such activity (Figure 1). Many disposal- of tomato juice or extraction waste-residues in wine making, yet contained significant amount of functionally useful components that may be recovered by immersing the dried waste residues in the functionally poor oil, ie., low grade oils. Figure 2 A, B shows it was indeed possible to recover such component like lycopene and carotenoids, and the spectrum of this oil exhibits multiple peaks correspond tomato lycopene. (2) Antioxidation activity: (a) Acid value after light and heat exposure. Commercial highly purified edible oils are vulnerable for oxidation and resulting in lipid or alkyl hydroperoxides formation (ROOH), which undergo formation lipid (alkyl) peroxyl radicals which (ROO.) in the presence of heme or other metallic compounds (ROOH à ROO.)

The fuels studied are fuels used in heavy duty vehicles (trucks and buses) and data sets for the following fuels are published in the database; ED 95, Fossil diesel, RME, HVO, biogas and natural gas. The reference unit for the reported LCI-data is 1 MJ fuel. When assessing the impact from using different fuels in vehicles, the consumption of the fuel needs to be considered in addition to the environmental data for the fuel. Note that the fuel consumption in heavy duty vehicles can differ widely due to other factors than the fuel type, namely vehicle type and driving conditions. The actual figures are presented in the database and not in the report. However, an illustration of the results for the fuel data sets based on global warming potentials [g CO 2 -eq/MJ fuel] is presented. For well-to-tank, there are for most fuels two different scenarios; allocation and system expansion. For fossil diesel and natural gas there is only one scenario. The different scenarios published are the scenarios available in the original data sources. For well-to-tank, the biofuels ED 95, RME and HVO show a larger impact than the fossil diesel. Biogas, regardless of the production process, shows a similar impact as the natural gas. For tank-to-wheel, two data sets for each fuel are presented; Euro V and Euro VI engine. The data sets differ concerning the emissions of methane (CH 4), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and particles (PM), while emissions of fossil carbon dioxide (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) are the same irrespective of Euro class. For the biofuels biogas and HVO, the fossil carbon dioxide (CO 2) is assumed to be zero. The global warming impact however is not zero, since there are small emissions of the other greenhouse gases (CH 4 and N 2 O). For RME a very small part (1 of 19 carbon atoms) in the fuel is of fossil origin, which means that some fossil CO 2 is generated as well. For ED 95 the fossil CO 2 comes from the components (not from the ethanol). All biofuels have a global warming impact of less than 10 grams of CO 2 -eq/MJ, while the fossil fuels vary between 60 - 75 grams of CO 2 -eq/MJ. For most bio fuels, the total well-to-wheel impact is much lower than for the corresponding fossil fuels. The impact from ED 95 and RME is less than 40 % of the impact from diesel. The biogases (no allocation) show an impact of between 10 - 30 % of the impact from natural gas. If considering the system expansion from the use of biogases, the savings from biogas will be even higher. The only biofuel showing an impact within in the same range as the corresponding fossil fuel is HVO from palm oil, which has {{more or less the same}} impact as diesel has. The HVO from <b>rape-seed</b> <b>oil</b> is however significantly lower (40 %) compared to fossil diesel. General conclusions *) The choice of methodology (e. g. energy allocation or no allocation versus system expansion) can have large influence on the LCI results (data). *) The choices of the alternative material and/or energy which are assumed to replace the generated by-products and/or energy are of large importance. *) For ED 95 and RME there are small differences between the two scenarios energy allocation and system expansion. *) For the biogases, it is the opposite situation. The system expansion results in much lower values (often even negative). This is an expected result since the corresponding “allocation” scenario, allocates the entire impact to the biogas...|$|E
