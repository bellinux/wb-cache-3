5000|$|Upon {{investigation}} of these adverse events by the FDA, academic institutions, and the involved pharmaceutical companies, the contaminant {{was identified as}} an [...] "over-sulfated" [...] derivative of chondroitin sulfate, a closely <b>related</b> <b>substance</b> obtained from mammal or fish cartilage and often used {{as a treatment for}} arthritis. Since over-sulfated chondroitin is not a naturally occurring molecule, costs a fraction of true heparin starting material, and mimics the in-vitro properties of heparin, the counterfeit was almost certainly intentional as opposed to an accidental lapse in manufacturing. [...] The raw heparin batches were found to have been cut from 2-60% with the counterfeit substance, and motivation for the adulteration was attributed to a combination of cost effectiveness and a shortage of suitable pigs in China.|$|E
5000|$|Interest in dihydrogen bonding was reignited {{upon the}} crystallographic {{characterization}} of the molecule H3NBH3. In this molecule, like the one studied by Brown and Hazeltine, the hydrogen atoms on nitrogen have a partial positive charge, denoted Hδ+, and the hydrogen atoms on boron have a partial negative charge, often denoted Hδ−. [...] In other words, the amine is a protic acid and the borane end is hydridic. The resulting B&minus;H...H&minus;N attractions stabilize the molecule as a solid. In contrast, the <b>related</b> <b>substance</b> ethane, H3CCH3, is a gas with a boiling point 285 °C lower. Because two hydrogen centers are involved, the interaction is termed a dihydrogen bond. Formation of a dihydrogen bond is assumed to precede formation of H2 from the reaction of a hydride and a protic acid. A very short dihydrogen bond is observed in NaBH4·2H2O with H&minus;H contacts of 1.79, 1.86, and 1.94 Å.|$|E
5000|$|For the two murders found proven by {{the court}} in The Hague, many experts [...] do not exclude a natural cause of death. In the case where digoxin {{poisoning}} was alleged, and supposedly detected by independent measurements in two Dutch laboratories, the method used in those laboratories did not exclude that the substance found was actually a <b>related</b> <b>substance</b> naturally produced in the human body. The Strasbourg laboratory used a new method, a test of high specificity and sensitivity, and {{did not support the}} digoxin overdose hypothesis. In the second case, the intoxication could have been an overdose caused by a faulty prescription. For both children, it was not clear how and when De Berk was able to administer the poison. Regarding the digoxin case, the prosecution gave a detailed reconstruction of the timing. However, other parts of the evidence discarded by the prosecution showed by the time-stamp on a certain monitor that at the alleged moment of poisoning De Berk was not with the patient at all, and that the specialist and his assistant were with the patient at that time.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the formation and forming mechanism of the <b>related</b> <b>substance</b> E in potassium clavulanate production. The impurity with retention time of 11. 1 min in potassium clavulanate final product was confirmed as the <b>related</b> <b>substance</b> E by high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS). The <b>related</b> <b>substance</b> E analysis during the production of clavulanic acid showed that this impurity could be formed during both the fermentation and purification processes, especially in the later fermentation stage, filtration concentration and back-extraction procedure. Clavulanic acid was the precursor of the <b>related</b> <b>substance</b> E. Studies on its forming mechanism showed that the <b>related</b> <b>substance</b> E was formed by the combination of the imino group of one molecule of clavulanic acid with the carboxyl group of another molecule of clavulanic acid with the opening of &# 946;-lactam ring. Results of a multi-factor orthogonal test confirmed that the concentration of clavulanic acid was the dominant factor to accelerate the reaction, while the temperature was another contributing factor. The pH 5. 0 - 6. 5 had little impact on the generation of the <b>related</b> <b>substance</b> E...|$|E
