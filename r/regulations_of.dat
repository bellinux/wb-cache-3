40|$|Many {{photosynthetic}} organisms exhibit light-dependent <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> {{growth and}} development, including photoregulation of pigmentation, physiology, and form. We recently {{demonstrated that the}} photoregulation of cellular and filament morphology in Fremyella diplosiphon is under control of a photosensory photoreceptor and differentially impacted by photosynthetic pigment accumulation. Biliprotein photoreceptor RcaE controls the light-dependent <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> pigmentation and of cell and filament morphology in F. diplosiphon, primarily in response to green and red light {{as a part of}} a light acclimation process known as complementary chromatic adaptation (CCA). Our recent investigations into the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> CCA underscored the largely independent <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> pigmentation and cell shape by RcaE. However, recent studies on the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> phycobiliprotein biosynthesis indicated that filament length may depend upon correct photoregulation of photosynthetic pigment levels.

5|$|Mario & Sonic on the Wii and DS is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. Players can assume the role of a Nintendo or Sega character while competing against the others in these events. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real life sports, such as swinging a paddle. The DS version uses the stylus and button controls. Both games closely follow rules and <b>regulations</b> <b>of</b> the specific sports. Sega adopted the IOC's mission of promoting a sporting spirit and its desire to interest young people in the Olympics by using its characters. Due to this atmosphere of competitive sportsmanship, Sega received approval by Nintendo to include Mario in the game with Sonic. Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of the video game series released by Sega in order to provide the company with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario in the early 1990s.|$|E
