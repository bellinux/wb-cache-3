5|$|Commutative algebra makes great use of {{rings of}} polynomials {{in one or}} several variables, {{introduced}} above. Their multiplication is both commutative and associative.

5|$|Many number systems, {{such as the}} {{integers}} and the rationals enjoy {{a naturally}} given group structure. In some cases, such as with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as <b>rings</b> <b>and</b> fields. Further abstract algebraic concepts such as modules, vector spaces and algebras also form groups.|$|E

5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, <b>rings,</b> <b>and</b> amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} statistic. There are also usable items such as potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E

5|$|Dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) of the timbers {{has enabled}} precise dating of the track, showing {{it was built}} in 3807 BC.

Analysis of the Sweet Track's timbers has aided research into Neolithic Era dendrochronology; comparisons with wood from the River Trent and a submerged forest at Stolford enabled a fuller mapping of the <b>rings,</b> <b>and</b> their relationship with the climate of the period.|$|E
