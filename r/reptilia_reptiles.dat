5|$|Michigan, one of {{the fifty}} United States, is home to two types of lizards, {{nineteen}} types of snakes and eleven types of turtles, {{all members of the}} class <b>Reptilia.</b> <b>Reptiles</b> are found throughout Michigan, although the only venomous species, the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, is seen only in the Lower Peninsula. Reptiles are cold-blooded, and so usually pass the cold winters of Michigan in frost-free areas, such as underground burrows (for snakes and land-dwelling turtles) or the bottoms of lakes and streams (for water-dwelling turtles). Most reptiles in Michigan are protected by state law, but many are still at risk due to human encroachment on their habitats, the draining of wetlands and, in the case of snakes, indiscriminate killing by fearful humans. In 1995, the painted turtle was named as Michigan's state reptile.|$|E
5000|$|Laurenti is {{considered}} the auctor of the class <b>Reptilia</b> (<b>reptiles)</b> through his authorship of [...] (1768) on the poisonous function of reptiles and amphibians. This was an important book in herpetology, defining thirty genera of reptiles; Carl Linnaeus's 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758 defined only ten genera. Specimen Medicum contains {{a description of the}} blind salamander (amphibian): Proteus anguinus, purportedly collected from cave waters in Slovenia (or possibly western Croatia); this description represented one of the first published accounts of a cave animal in the western world, although the Proteus anguinus wasn't recognized as a cave animal at the time.|$|E
50|$|Reptilia {{specializes in}} movie {{production}} and provides reptiles along with skilled handlers for film productions, photo shoots, and television. <b>Reptilia</b> has provided <b>reptiles</b> for Guinness, Murdoch Mysteries, Canada's Greatest Know-It-All, YTV, Discovery Channel Canada's Daily Planet, {{and many more}} shows and productions over the years.|$|R
50|$|The {{term was}} coined {{to apply to}} {{well-known}} taxa like <b>reptiles</b> (<b>Reptilia)</b> which, as commonly named and traditionally defined, is paraphyletic with respect to mammals and birds. Reptilia contains the last common ancestor of reptiles and all descendants of that ancestor—including all extant reptiles {{as well as the}} extinct synapsids—except for mammals and birds. Other commonly recognized paraphyletic groups include fish, monkeys and lizards.|$|R
40|$|Based {{on current}} {{research}} results, {{a total of}} 40 vertebrate species from 4 classes have been registered at 10 archaeological sites from the Neolithic period in Vojvodina (Serbia). The most numerous one is the mammal class (Mammalia) with 25 species, then bird class (Aves) with 9 species, osteichthyes (Osteichthyes) are represented by 5 species, while <b>reptiles</b> (<b>Reptilia)</b> are the poorest class with only one species. For the Eneolithic period, at 7 archaeological sites, a total of 11 species members of Mammalia class have been registered...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on current}} {{published}} and unpublished research results, {{a total of}} 34 vertebrate species from 4 classes have been registered at 9 archaeological sites from the Early Iron Age in Vojvodina (Serbia). The most numerous one is the mammal class (Mammalia) with 22 species, then osteichthyes class (Osteichthyes) with 10 species, while birds (Aves) and <b>reptiles</b> (<b>Reptilia)</b> are repsented with one species each. From the Late Iron Age, at 14 archaeological sites, a total of 21 species were registered, of which 16 belong to the mammal class (Mammalia), birds (Aves) are represented by 2 species, and osteichthyes (Osteichthyes) by 3 species...|$|R
40|$|Iguanids {{are greatly}} diversed group of squamate <b>reptiles</b> (<b>Reptilia,</b> Squamata). Although {{there were many}} phylogenetical studies made, the {{relationships}} among main lineages are still unclear. In cytogenetical {{point of view is}} this group relatively conservative. In three species-rich genus only, the diversity of karyotypes is relatively considerable: Anolis, Liolaemus a Sceloporus. Diploid chromosome number varies between 19 and 48. Ancestral karyotype is defined as 2 n= 36, with 12 macrochromosomes and 24 microchromosomes. Morphologically the macrochromosomes are mostly metacentric, rarely acrocentric or telocentric. In karyotype evolution Robertsonian rearrangements dominate apparently, where number of chromosome arms is preserved. Interspecific variability or variability between populations were observed. Sex seems to be determined by genotype for whole group (GSD). Across the group probably attended conditionally to multiple differentiation of sex chromosomes. In 75 of 219 caryotyped were detected XX/XY type of sex chromosomes or derived multiple sex system X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 /X 1 X 2 Y. The transition from multiple sex chromosomes back to XX/XY type was observed in one species. Chromosome Y shows morphological variability in size and shape, from microchromosom to huge metacentric macrochromosom. Homology of sex [...] ...|$|R
