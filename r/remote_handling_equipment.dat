The {{purpose of the}} cells is to provide safe environments for package handling and sealing operations. Once sealed, the packages are placed in the Yucca Mountain Repository. Closure of a typical waste package involves a number of remote operations. Those involved typically include the placement of matched lids onto the waste package. The lids are then individually sealed to the waste package by welding. Currently, the waste package includes three lids. One lid is placed before movement of the waste package to the closure cell; the final two are placed inside the closure cell, where they are welded to the waste package. These and other important operations require considerable <b>remote</b> material <b>handling</b> within the cell environment.

40|$|Plutonium-uranium {{extraction}} (PUREX) connectors, {{the most}} common connectors used at the Hanford site, offer {{a certain level of}} flexibility in pipe routing, process system configuration, and remote equipment/instrument replacement. However, these desirable features have inherent shortcomings like leakage, high pressure drop through the right angle bends, and a limited range of available pipe diameters that can be connect by them.

The first muon collider design studies were as well followed with great interest. Beta Beam activities reported the excellent progress made, together with the research activity scheduled {{to take place in}} the coming years. Discussion sessions were also organised together with the other working groups in order to define common grounds for the optimisation of a future neutrino facility. The lessons learnt from already operating neutrino facilities are providing key elements for the design of any future neutrino facilities.

Each arm of the system had six DOFs (degrees of freedom), and the bridge transport system had four DOFs. However, despite the dexterous manipulators and redundant monitoring system, many operators, including professionals, experienced difficulties in operating the <b>remote</b> <b>handling</b> system.

Many improvements of the design from former phases are implemented, particularly a reduction of beam losses and operational costs thanks to the superconducting accelerator concept, the re-location of the quench tank outside the test cell (TC) with a reduction of tritium inventory and a simplification on its replacement in case of failure, the separation of the irradiation modules from the shielding block gaining irradiation flexibility and enhancement of the <b>remote</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> reliability and cost reduction, and the water cooling of the liner and biological shielding of the TC, enhancing the efficiency and economy of the related sub-systems. In addition, the maintenance strategy has been modified to allow a shorter yearly stop of the irradiation operations and a more careful management of the irradiated samples. The design of the IFMIF plant is intimately linked with the EVA phase carried out since the entry into force of IFMIF/EVEDA in June 2007.

40|$|In the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), in-vessel {{components}} such as {{blanket and}} divertor, which are {{installed in the}} vacuum vessel of the ITER, are maintained by <b>remote</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> (RH equipment). The RH equipment for maintenance is operated under sever environmental conditions, such as high temperature (50 approx 100 degC), high gamma-ray radiation (approx 1 kGy/h) {{in an atmosphere of}} inert gas or vacuum; therefore many components of the RH equipment must have a suitable radiation resistance efficiency for long time operation (10 approx 100 MGy). Typical components of the RH equipment have been extensively tested under an intensive gamma-ray radiation. Monitoring of the radiation dose of the components of the RH equipment is essential to control the operation period of the RH equipment considering radiation resistance. However, the maximum measurable radiation dose of the conventional dosimeters, such as ionization chamber, liquid, glass and plastic dosimeters are limited to be approximately 1 MGy which is too low to monitor the RH equipment for the ITER. In addition, these conventional dosimeters do not involve sufficient radiation resistance against the high gamma-ray radiation as well as are not easy handling and low cost. Based on the above backgrounds, a new dosimeter with bleaching of an azo group dye to be applied to a radiation monitor has been developed for high gamma-ray radiation use. The colored alumilite dosimeter is composed of the azo group dye (-N=N-) in an anodic oxidation layer of aluminum alloy (Al sub 2 O sub 3). It can monitor the radiation dose by measuring the change of the bleaching of azo dye in the Al sub 2 O sub 3 layer due to gamma-ray irradiation. The degree of bleaching is measured as the change of hue (color) and brightness based on the Munsell's colors with a three dimensional universe using spectrophotometer. In the tests, the dependencies such as colors, anodized layer thickness, type of azo dy of the crature and ultraviolet radiation were investigated using the various colored alumilite samples. The followings were clarified from the test results; - a red colored alumilite sample has shown remarkable bleaching change compared with blue and green colored alumilite samples, - the characteristic of bleaching depends on dose rate, - the degree of bleaching of thick-anodized layer sample is lower than that of thin- anodized layer, - the bleaching is activated under high temperature (over 75 degC), - there is no effect of ultraviolet radiation (310 approx 410 nm). As a whole, a red colored and a blue colored alumilite samples are suitable to measure under high dose rate and low dose rate conditions, respectively. For example, a red colored alumilite sample made of TAC-RED 105 dye with layer thickness of 25 mu m is measurable up to 70 MGy under high dose rate of 10 kGy/h. On the other hand, a blue colored alumilite sample made of TAC-BLUE RCD dye with layer thickness of 10 mu m is measurable up to 10 kGy under low dose rate of 2 Gy/h. In this paper, the outline of the colored alumilite dosimeter, bleaching mechanism, measurement method and details of the various test results are described...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a growing need for a variety of custom {{tailored}} instrumentation equipment to serve in advanced nuclear applications. Most of todays of the shelf electronics (ADCs, amplifiers, pressure sensors, multiplexers [...] .) are not specified to meet the demanding requirements in these environments. This article reports on the design of an ADC suitable for use with the discrete time switched capacitor instrumentation amplifiers and reports on a multiplexer to interface multiple ADCs. The circuit in this article is intended for use in <b>remote</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> in the ITER fusion reactor and may be subjected to an ionizing radiation and high temperature environment. In addition, it could serve for various other applications requiring a guaranteed functionality in these extreme environments. Examples of these applications are the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN and the MYRRHA (Multi-purpose Hybrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) reactor which is being developed at SCK-CEN, The Belgian Nuclear Research Centre in Mol, Belgium and even complex space applications. In the presentation a radiation tolerant delta Sigma ADC and multiplexer will be presented. The ADC features a 1. 5 V, 17 bit Delta Sigma ADC consuming 4. 35 mW for a 1 kHz bandwidth. The sample frequency is 1 MHz. The ADC utilizes a correlated double sampling technique (CDS) to remove offset and 1 /f noise. The 17 bit resolution is maintained upon a simulated radiation dose exceeding 1 MGy and varying temperatures between 0 ∘C and 85 ∘C. In this work there is chosen for CDS (correlated double sampling) instead of CHS (Chopper stabilization) because it intrinsically removes offset instead of modulating it to a higher frequency. Controlling the offset and hence also the 1 /f-noise is of importance as these tend to increase under radiation. Note that an increased offset could severely limit the dynamic performance of the ADC. Furthermore the conversion of pressure and temperature signals requires a low bandwidth (< 1 kHz). Because 1 /f noise dominates in this signalband, the CDS technique is the preferred solution. In this article a delta sigma ADC will be shown which makes use of the CDS technique. A Delta-Sigma modulator is the most suitable architecture as its envisaged application in the conversion of pressure and temperature signals requires a low bandwidth (< 1 kHz) and high resolution (up to 17 bit). Furthermore Delta-Sigma ADCs are less prone to mismatch since no resistive dividers or matched current mirrors are necessary as in a flash ADC. A Delta-Sigma ADC can use a single bit conversion which makes it more robust to process variations and mismatch. Since the ADC is planned for use in an extreme environment where transistor parameters are affected by varying temperatures and influences of radiation the ADCs robustness is critical. Next a multiplexer will be presented. The multiplexer is able to interface multiple channels parrallel at its input and converts this data into a serial datastream. It can multiplex 256 channels at a clock frequency of 128 MHz or has a data throughput of 256 MSample/s. The multiplexer will drastically reduce the number of cables in the instrumentation network. In addition the simulated radiation and temperature tolerance was found to be outstanding. Finally, together with a previously designed instrumentation amplifier, the ADC and multiplexer form a radiation tolerant ASIC which can interface more than hundred pressure and/or resistive sensors. status: publishe...|$|E
