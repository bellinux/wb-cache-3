40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the rise and decline of {{small-scale}} sugarcane grower (SSG) production in KwaZulu-Natal must be historically located within a changing structural relationship with miller-processors, in turn conditioned by shifts in regulatory frameworks. Critically, the emergence of SSG production in the late- 1970 s– 1980 s {{can be traced to}} industry-subsidised initiatives disguised as micro-credit which brought commercially inalienable Bantustan land into cane production with strong miller oversight. From the late 1980 – 1990 s, however, the elimination of these subsidies encouraged millers to withdraw from direct oversight and to subcontract support to farmers, while simultaneously instigating an increase in SSG numbers by removing restrictions on grower registration. Enduring drought must certainly be understood as a central proximal factor in the rapid decline of SSGs, but their rapid increase in the first place was structurally fragile. This paper further strives to provide insight into the shifting class dynamics of SSGs under constrained conditions of production, utilising survey data from seventy SSG homesteads and life-history interviews in two rural wards of the Umfolozi region. Although proceeds from sugarcane have represented an important source of cash-income for homesteads, deteriorating terms of exchange and barriers to expansion <b>in</b> <b>land</b> and capital have placed a greater emphasis on sparse off-farm income opportunities for stabilising consumption and enabling limited <b>re-investment</b> <b>in</b> production. The centrality of income-diversification for simple reproduction and limited accumulation has rendered the dynamics of social differentiation both unstable and reversible. The paper concludes by exploring the implications for agrarian reform policy...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{methodology}} to improve decision making about investments that reduce buildings' energy consumption. Design/methodology/approach: A three-stage methodology was developed and tested to analyse an existing Australian office building's energy use, its energy rating, and its life cycle investment. In total, seven cases of sets of improvements were modelled for energy performance. Their investment value was evaluated using a life cycle-based analysis across several investment options. Findings: A holistic approach to investment shows that the most effective sustainable refurbishments need not be the most expensive. Optimised investment can take advantage of the timing of both <b>re-investment</b> <b>in</b> component renewal and efficiency gains from the refurbishment. Furthermore, relatively small changes in income can offset capital expenditure for refurbishments and protect against obsolescence. Originality/value: Much work on sustainable refurbishments rarely considers the investment basis, across a life cycle, of that expenditure, generally seeing them as a cost and rarely considers the optimal time for that expenditure in the asset life cycle. This paper addresses both concerns...|$|R
40|$|Since 2007, the European {{cement and}} steel sectors have been {{characterized}} by substantial surplus production capacity. Hence <b>re-investment</b> <b>in</b> primary production of many materials remains limited and endangers the longer-term economic viability of many plants. Opportunities for innovation and modernization could overcome these challenges.

Only a limited share of these opportunities has been captured so far, which {{can be attributed to}} the policies implemented to date. For the future realization of innovation and modernization opportunities, a clear longer-term perspective is required in three policy elements. First, an effective carbon price emerging from the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) that is relevant both for producers, to facilitate switching to lower-carbon production, and also for intermediate and final consumers to create a viable long-term business case for large-scale investments in lower carbon processes, materials, and efficient use. Second, public funding for the innovation and demonstration of breakthrough technologies. Third, institutional arrangements including aspects like norms and standards as well as provisions for training of craftsmen need to be adjusted to enable the use of new production processes and materials...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the extensive restructuring of community-based long-term care that was initiated in Ontario, Canada in 1996, and does so with particular reference to longstanding problems of provision in rural communities. Specifically, it draws {{on a case}} study focussed on two small rural towns to develop a 'situated understanding' of service-user and service-provider perspectives on service coordination issues and on service cuts, particularly as they affect the ability of elderly people reliant on publicly-funded community services {{to stay in their}} homes, to continue to 'age in place'. The general and specific antecedents of long-term care reform are considered prior to the presentation of the case study. General antecedents include the rapid aging of Canada's population and aggressive strategies to reduce government deficits, while specific antecedents flow from a decade of failed attempts to address longstanding issues of service coordination and from the ideologically-driven, free market stance of the provincial government elected in 1995. The analysis of interviews conducted with 14 community-service users and 17 providers suggests that the managed competition system introduced as the centerpiece of long-term care reform has resulted in increasing diversity and uncertainty {{on both sides of the}} service provision equation. Despite continued attempts by rural elderly people and their families to 'cut and paste' support packages, it seems that the restructuring of publicly-funded community services, combined with a substantial <b>re-investment</b> <b>in</b> long-term care facilities, will make some elderly people more vulnerable to institutionalization.

50|$|The {{financial}} {{history of the}} Dutch Republic involves the interrelated development of financial institutions in the Dutch Republic. The rapid economic development of the country after the Dutch Revolt in the years 1585 - 1620 accompanied by an equally rapid accumulation of a large fund of savings, created the need to invest those savings profitably. The Dutch financial sector, both in its public and private components, came to provide {{a wide range of}} modern investment products beside the possibility of (<b>re-)investment</b> <b>in</b> trade and industry, and in infrastructure projects. Such products were the public bonds, floated by the Dutch governments on a national, provincial, and municipal level; acceptance credit and commission trade; marine and other insurance products; and shares of publicly traded companies like the Dutch East India Company (VOC), and their derivatives. Institutions like the Amsterdam stock exchange, the Bank of Amsterdam, and the merchant bankers helped to mediate this investment. In the course of time the invested capital stock generated its own income stream that (because of the high propensity to save of the Dutch capitalists) caused the capital stock to assume enormous proportions. As {{by the end of the}} 17th century structural problems in the Dutch economy precluded profitable investment of this capital in domestic Dutch sectors, the stream of investments was redirected more and more to investment abroad, both in sovereign debt and foreign stocks, bonds and infrastructure. The Netherlands came to dominate the international capital market up to the crises of the end of the 18th century that caused the demise of the Dutch Republic.|$|R
