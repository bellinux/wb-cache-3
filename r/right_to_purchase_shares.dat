25|$|In 1959, Sherman Fairchild {{exercised}} his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>shares</b> of {{the members}} of the traitorous eight. Jay Last recalled (in 2007) that this event happened too early and turned former partners into ordinary employees, destroying the team spirit. In November 1960, Tom Bay, the Vice President of Marketing at Fairchild, accused Last of squandering money and demanded termination of Last's project of developing integrated circuits. Moore refused to help Last, and Noyce declined to discuss the matter. This conflict was the last straw: on January 31, 1961 Last and Hoerni left Fairchild and to head Amelco, the microelectronics branch of Teledyne. Kleiner and Roberts joined them after a few weeks. Blank, Grinich, Moore and Noyce stayed with Fairchild. The traitorous eight split into two groups of four.|$|E
50|$|In a PrivJSC {{shares are}} {{distributed}} only among its founders or another predetermined group of persons. A closed company {{has the right}} to conduct a closed subscription to its shares, while the shareholders of a closed company have a pre-emptive <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>shares</b> sold by other company shareholders. The number of company’s shareholders should not exceed 50.|$|E
50|$|An open {{company has}} the right to conduct open {{subscription}} to its shares - among an unlimited group of persons and closed subscription (a limited predetermined group of persons), if the opportunity to conduct a closed subscription is not limited by company’s charter or legal acts. Shareholders do not have a pre-emptive <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>shares</b> sold by other shareholders of the company. The number of shareholders is unlimited.|$|E

50|$|Shareholders {{are granted}} special {{privileges}} {{depending on the}} class of stock, including the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> vote on matters such as elections {{to the board of}} directors, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> share in distributions of the company's income, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> new <b>shares</b> issued by the company, and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> a company's assets during a liquidation of the company. However, shareholder's <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> a company's assets are subordinate <b>to</b> the <b>rights</b> of the company's creditors.|$|R

5000|$|In 1635, Eliard Swanston, Robert Benfield, and Thomas Pollard, three {{actors in}} the King's Men who were sharers in the company but not [...] "householders" [...] or {{shareholders}} in the theatres, petitioned the Lord Chamberlain [...] - [...] then Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke [...] - [...] for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>shares</b> in the theatres. Pembroke ordered Shank and the Burbage family to sell shares to the three actors; but Shank and Cuthbert Burbage both protested the ruling. The dispute generated a back-and-forth documentation, sometimes called the [...] "sharers' papers," [...] that has provided subsequent generations of scholars and researchers with important data on the theatre business of the age. Shank complained {{that he and the}} three actors could not reach acceptable terms for a sale, and that they prevented him from performing with the company. The dispute seems to have injected a significant degree of bitterness into the last year of Shank's life.|$|E
5000|$|Options {{are also}} {{difficult}} to ascertain. A stock option is a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>shares</b> {{of a company}} at a fixed price. Companies with growth potential sometimes award stock options as compensation to employees, during times when {{there is not enough}} money to pay a suitable salary. By accepting a stock option for compensation, an employee invests his or her own trust in the belief that he or she will help make the company acquire a higher value. Thereafter, the employee works and contributes value to the company. If the company later acquires a higher share valuation, then the employee may [...] "cash in" [...] his options by selling them at the fair market value. The employee's trust in this future value motivates his work without immediate compensation. That effort has value. If the marriage is terminated before the shares are cashed in, then the parties must decide how to apportion the community property portion of the options. This can be difficult. Case law precedents are not yet available for all situations involving stock options.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a valuation model of callable warrants under a {{setting of the}} optimal stopping problem between the holder (investor) and the issuer (firm). A warrant is the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> new <b>shares</b> at a predetermined price. When the new stocks are issued, {{the value of the}} stock is diluted. We consider the model taking the dilution into account. After identifying optimal policies for the issuer and the investor, we explore the analytical properties of the optimal exercise and call boundaries for the holder and the issuer, respectively. Furthermore, the value of such a callable warrant and the optimal critical prices are examined numerically using the binomial method.

5000|$|Issued in 1983, the Derg's Proclamation No. 235 (the Joint Venture Proclamation) {{signaled}} Ethiopia's {{renewed interest}} in attracting foreign capital. The proclamation offered incentives such as a five-year period of income tax relief for new projects, import and export duty relief, tariff protection, and repatriation of profits and capital. It limited foreign holdings {{to a maximum of}} 49 percent and the duration of any joint venture to twenty-five years. Although the proclamation protected investors' interests from expropriation, the government reserved the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> all <b>shares</b> in a joint venture [...] "for reasons of national interest." [...] The proclamation failed to attract foreign investment, largely because foreign businesses were hesitant to invest in a country whose government recently had nationalized foreign industries without a level of compensation these businesses considered satisfactory.|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the problems}} that can arise when implementing the rights of shareholders in private limited liability companies <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> the <b>shares</b> of another shareholder being for sale in priority to others and the possible legal remedies for violated <b>rights.</b> According <b>to</b> {{the practice of the}} Lithuanian Supreme Court, the rights of the buyer cannot be assigned to a private limited liability company shareholder whose pre-emption <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> the <b>shares</b> being for sale has been breached. However, in this article it is being argued that perhaps in certain exceptional cases, in order to create fair business practice and ensure a "tangible" result for the plaintiff in relation to the judgment, the court could (should) take advantage of the freedom to maneuver and, by implementing justice, change the method of restitution (pertaining to the subject) – assign the shares to the plaintiff (an aggrieved shareholder) simultaneously creating an obligation on the same person to settle properly with the last owner of the disputed shares...|$|R
5000|$|In his will, Conrad {{also gave}} Barron the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> those <b>shares</b> {{in order to}} {{maintain}} family control of the company, but the foundation challenged the option in probate court. It took an entire decade to resolve the issue. Hilton's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> exercise his option was upheld in an appeals court ruling in March 1988, giving him voting power over roughly 34 percent of the company's outstanding shares. Conrad's bequest of stock was worth $160 million when he died in 1979. Thanks to his son's successful management of the Hilton Hotels Corporation, those shares were worth $654 million when the settlement was reached late in 1988. In a press statement issued after the favorable ruling, Hilton said it gave him [...] "the opportunity to structure an arrangement whereby my father's two objectives, retaining control of the stock in family hands, and benefitting charity through the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, can both be achieved. I am confident that my father would be pleased with this accord." ...|$|R
5|$|In November, Lyn {{stated that}} they wanted <b>to</b> <b>purchases</b> the <b>shares</b> in Ullevaal from NFF, who {{stated that they}} were now worth NOK10 million. NFF also raised {{questions}} if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium {{and that they were}} opposed to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> the <b>shares</b> for NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|R
500|$|Enron {{transferred}} to [...] "Raptor I-IV", four LJM-related special purpose entities {{named after the}} velociraptors in Jurassic Park, more than [...] "$1.2 billion in assets, including millions of shares of Enron common stock and long term <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> millions more <b>shares,</b> plus $150 million of Enron notes payable" [...] as disclosed in the company's financial statement footnotes. The special purpose entities {{had been used to}} pay for all of this using the entities' debt instruments. The footnotes also declared that the instruments' face amount totaled $1.5 billion, and the entities notional amount of $2.1 billion had been used to enter into derivative contracts with Enron.|$|R
50|$|To {{counteract}} {{a possible}} hostile corporate takeover in 1987, the Tribune Company developed {{a plan that}} allowed shareholders the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> additional preferred <b>shares</b> from {{a new series of}} stock in the event that a buyer acquired 10% of the company's common stock or a tender offer for the company. Shareholders also ratified a two-for-one stock split. Tribune Entertainment experienced success in 1987 with the launch of the syndicated daytime talk show Geraldo. In 1988, Tribune purchased five weekly papers based in Santa Clara County, California. In the wake of a dispute with some of its labor unions, Tribune sold the Daily News to British businessman Robert Maxwell in 1991.|$|R
500|$|In May, it {{was stated}} that the matter would not be handled in the courts, but instead by the Football Association's Tribunal, with the {{possibility}} {{to appeal to the}} Norwegian Confederation of Sports' Tribunal. This was because FIFA's regulations forbade a club form suing their own federation. In January 1995, the tribunal decided that Lyn had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> the <b>shares</b> for NOK4.4 million plus interest. By February, it became clear that Lyn did not have sufficient liquidity <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> the <b>shares.</b> In December 1995, three months before the purchase option became invalid, the club bought back the shares. In 2001, it became clear that Lyn had given false information about the deal, and that the club had signed an agreement with Lyn Fotball AS which was later criticized by club members as a [...] "raid" [...] by the investors to secure the main asset in Lyn. The loan had a high interest rate and had clauses that made a refinancing expensive, it gave the investors a right of pre-emption for the shares, the right for the investors to terminate the load on short notice, and the right for the investors to take over the shares should the club not be able to manage the debt.|$|R
50|$|Tandy Leather {{became an}} {{attractive}} commodity and was purchased in 1955 by the American Hide and Leather Company of Boston (name change in 1956 to General American Industries). Charles continued {{to maintain control}} of managing the Tandy Leather division while owned by GAI. During 1956, General American Industries acquired three other companies unrelated to the leather industry and a struggle {{for control of the}} parent company began. Charles saw the need to emancipate from the direction initiated by GAI. He used all his resources, raised additional money, and exercised his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> the 500,000 <b>shares</b> of stock that were included in the original settlement. When the votes were counted on the day of that pivotal stockholders meeting, the Tandy group took management control of General American Industries.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1630s Swanston became {{involved}} in a major controversy within the King's Men. In the 1633 - 35 period, comedian John Shank <b>purchased</b> three <b>shares</b> in the Globe Theatre and two in the Blackfriars Theatre from William Heminges, the son and heir of John Heminges. Swanston {{at the time was}} a sharer in the acting company, but not in either of the company's theatres, which were separately organized. Swanston and two other men in the same situation, Robert Benfield and Thomas Pollard, petitioned the Lord Chamberlain, Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> lucrative theatre <b>shares</b> from Shanks and the Burbage family (Cuthbert Burbage and Winifred Robinson, Richard Burbage's widow). Pembroke ruled in their favor, and Shank and the Burbages protested. The affair generated a supply of documents, sometimes called the [...] "sharers' papers," [...] that throw light on the theatre conditions of the era. Shanks, for example, asserted that each of the three petitioners, as a sharer in the company, had an annual income of £180, a very comfortable living for that era. The Burbages and Shank also complained that Swanston owned a third of one of the eight shares in the Blackfriars, and so wasn't entirely excluded from the householders' profits. The disagreement was not fatal for Swanston's credit in the troupe, by any means: on 5 June 1638, Swanston alone signed for a payment of £240 for the company's Court performances (though by then both Shanks and Cuthbert Burbage were dead).|$|R

5000|$|To {{properly}} understand slippage, let's use {{the following}} example: Say, you (as a trader) wanted <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> 20,000 <b>shares</b> of SPY right now.
