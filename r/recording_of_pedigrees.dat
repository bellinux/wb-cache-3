40|$|To {{study the}} {{environmental}} and genetic factors affecting productive and reproductive traits, data on 5, 897 cows from five main recorded herds (for 1964 - 2004) of Sahiwal cattle in Pakistan were used. A general linear model was applied on the data. The 305 -day milk yield, total milk yield, lactation length, age at first calving, dry period, calving interval and service period averaged 1, 393 ± 12 kg, 1, 429 ± 11 kg, 235 ± 2, 1, 390 ± 4, 244 ± 3, 464 ± 3 and 1, 78 ± 3 days, respectively. The age at first calving was effected by herd, year and season of birth. The 305 -day and total milk yields were affected by herd, year, season of calving, age at first calving, service period and lactation length while all other first lactation traits were affected by herd, year, season of calving and 305 -day milk yield. Animal model heritability estimates for these traits were 0. 11 ± 0. 029, 0. 11 ± 0. 028, 0. 09 ± 0. 027, 0. 02 ± 0. 019, 0. 05 ± 0. 019, 0. 12 ± 0. 027 and 0. 04 ± 0. 020, respectively. Rate of decline in first lactation milk yield was 7 l per year over the last 35 years with genetic trend close to zero. Lactation length and service period decreased and age at first calving increased by 2, 1 and 6 days per year, respectively. Herd differences {{for most of the}} traits were significant. Improved feeding and management may improve performance traits of Sahiwal cattle. Accurate <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> <b>pedigrees</b> and performance traits would help improve genetic parameters...|$|E

40|$|This paper emphasises the {{importance}} of developing a genetic improvement program that is not isolated from the social and physical environment {{in which it is}} operating. Growth and reproduction are likely {{to be the most important}} genetic traits. The minimum requirements to select for them are clear and permanent identification of animals together with <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>pedigrees,</b> weights, diet, husbandry, breeding dates and breeding outcomes. Nutrition needs to be improved and standardised to accelerate breeding by reducing the age of puberty and the post-partum anoestrous interval. Artificial breeding is useful but is not essential and, in many Bali cattle breeding systems, may be less efficient than well-controlled natural mating. The key appears to be to minimise costs and inconvenience, and this means substantial modification of the high-input systems used in many ‘Western’ countries. Possible strategies for doing this in Indonesia are outlined in the paper...|$|R

40|$|Population {{structure}} in five African beef cattle breeds in South Africa was investigated, {{to assess the}} effect <b>of</b> animal <b>recording</b> in management <b>of</b> genetic diversity and genetic improvement. <b>Pedigree</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> 247, 173 Afrikaner, 57, 561 Boran, 198, 557 Drakensberger, 256, 692 Nguni and 55, 309 Tuli breed were analysed using the online POPREP software system. Pedigree completeness over six generations varied with the lowest completeness in the Boran and {{the highest in the}} Afrikaner. The average generation interval ranged between 6. 0 to 6. 4 years. The rates of inbreeding per year were 0. 03 %, 0. 04 %, 0. 06 %, 0. 07 % and 0. 08 % in Boran, Nguni, Afrikaner, Drakensberger and Tuli respectively. Effective population sizes were 89, 107, 122, 191 and 364 in Tuli, Afrikaner, Drakensberger, Nguni and Boran respectively. Inbreeding and effective population size for the Boran was not a true reflection due to poor pedigree recording. These results indicate that none of the breeds are in critical limits of endangerment. Breeding values were regressed on birth year of each breed for weight traits; Kleiber ratio and scrotal circumference from 1986 to 2012. Genetic trends were stable for birth weights except the Afrikaner and Tuli. Genetic {{progress has been made in}} weaning and post weaning weights for all the breeds except for limited progress in the Nguni.

40|$|Data on 23925 lactations of 5897 Sahiwal cows in five Government {{herds of}} Punjab {{province}} were collected {{to estimate the}} genetic control and genetic correlations among performance traits. A repeatability animal model having herd-year-season and parity was used for this purpose. The repeatability estimates for 305 -d milk yield, total milk yield, lactation length, dry period, calving interval and service period were 0. 40 ± 0. 015, 0. 40 ± 0. 016, 0. 33 ± 0. 013, 0. 14 ± 0. 005, 0. 15 ± 0. 004, and 0. 14 ± 0. 005 respectively. The heritability estimates for these traits were 0. 10 ± 0. 016, 0. 09 ± 0. 016, 0. 06 ± 0. 013, 0. 14 ± 0. 009, 0. 15 ± 0. 010, and 0. 14 ± 0. 010, respectively. The phenotypic, genetic and environmental correlation of 305 -d milk yield with lactation length was 0. 71, 0. 48 and 0. 70, respectively, with dry period was - 0. 31, - 0. 43 and - 0. 22, respectively while with calving interval and service period exhibited similar pattern (0. 08, 0. 25 and 0. 08, respectively). The estimated breeding values ranged from - 447 to 1254 kg, - 442 to 1265 kg, - 24 to 38, - 78 to 116, - 84 to 107 and - 81 to 91, days for 305 -day milk yield, total milk yield, lactation length, dry period, calving interval and service period, respectively.

Hambleton Durrett had started the fashion. Capriciously, as he did everything else, he had become the owner of several hundred acres of pasture, woodland and orchard, acquired some seventy-five head of blooded stock, and proceeded to house them in model barns and milk by machinery; for several months he had bored everyone in the Boyne Club whom he could entice into conversation on the subject <b>of</b> the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>pedigreed</b> cows, and spent many bibulous nights on the farm in company with those parasites who surrounded him when he was in town. Then another interest had intervened; a feminine one, of course, and his energies were transferred (so we understood) to the reconstruction and furnishing of a little residence in New York, not far from Fifth Avenue. The farm continued under the expert direction of a superintendent who was a graduate of the State Agricultural College, and a select clientele, which could afford to pay the prices, consumed the milk and cream and butter. Quite consistent with their marital relations was the fact that Nancy should have taken a fancy to the place after Ham's interest had waned. Not that she cared for the Guernseys, or Jerseys, or whatever they may have been; she evinced a sudden passion for simplicity,--occasional simplicity, at least,--for a contrast to and escape from a complicated life of luxury. She built another house for the superintendent banished him from the little farmhouse (where Ham had kept two rooms); banished along with the superintendent the stiff plush furniture, the yellow-red carpets, the easels and the melodeon, and decked it out in bright chintzes, with wall-papers to match, dainty muslin curtains, and rag-carpet rugs on the hardwood floors. The pseudo-classic porch over the doorway, which had suggested a cemetery, was removed, and a wide piazza added, furnished with wicker lounging chairs and tables, and shaded with gay awnings.|$|R
