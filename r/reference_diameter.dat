40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the changes in}} stenotic and nonstenotic segments or a dilated coronary artery, detailed quantitative angiographic measurements were performed in 342 patients (398 lesions) immediately after angioplasty and at a predetermined follow-up time of 30, 60, 90 or 120 days after the dilation. Measurements of the stenotic segments were expressed as minimal luminal diameter, and the adjacent nonstenotic segments were expressed as interpolated <b>reference</b> <b>diameter</b> (both in millimeters). A follow-up rate of 86 % was achieved. In the patients followed up at 30 and 60 days, {{there was no significant}} change in either the mean minimal luminal diameter or the mean <b>reference</b> <b>diameter.</b> However, at 90 and 120 days, there was significant deterioration in both the mean minimal luminal diameter (− 0. 37 and − 0. 42 mm, respectively) and the mean <b>reference</b> <b>diameter</b> (− 0. 17 and − 0. 26 mm, respectively), all of the changes being highly significant (p < 0. 00001). The <b>reference</b> <b>diameter</b> is involved in the dilation process and may be subject to the same restenosis process that takes place in initially stenotic segments. Percent diameter stenosis measurements, which are conventionally used to express the change in the severity of a stenosis after angioplasty, will tend to underestimate the change when there is a simultaneous reduction in the <b>reference</b> <b>diameter...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Angiographic {{restenosis}} after percutaneous coronary interventional procedures is {{more common}} than recurrent angina. Clinical and angiographic factors associated with asymptomatic versus symptomatic restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention were compared. METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients with angiographic restenosis from the BENESTENT I, BENESTENT II pilot, BENESTENT II, MUSIC, WEST 1, DUET, FINESS 2, FLARE, SOPHOS, and ROSE studies were analyzed. Multivariate analysis evaluated 46 clinical and angiographic variables, comparing those with and without angina. The 10 studies recruited 2690 patients who underwent percutaneous revascularization and 6 -month follow-up angiography (86 % of those eligible). Restenosis (>/= 50 % diameter stenosis) occurred in 607 patients and was clinically silent in 335 (55 %). Male sex (P= 0. 008), absence of antianginal therapy with nitrates (P= 0. 0002) and calcium channel blockers (P= 0. 02) at 6 months, greater <b>reference</b> <b>diameter</b> after the procedure (P= 0. 04), greater <b>reference</b> <b>diameter</b> at follow-up (P= 0. 004), and lesser lesion severity (percent stenosis) at 6 months (P= 0. 0004) were univariate predictors of asymptomatic restenosis.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{clinical}} {{outcome in}} patients with complex coronary lesions treated with either excimer laser coronary angioplasty (ELCA) or balloon angioplasty. PATIENTS AND DESIGN: 308 patients with stable angina and a coronary lesion of more than 10 mm in length were randomised to ELCA (151 patients, 158 lesions) or balloon angioplasty (157 patients, 167 lesions). The primary clinical end points were death, myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery, or repeated coronary angioplasty of the randomised segment during six months of follow up. Subanalysis was performed to identify a subgroup of patients with a beneficial clinical outcome following ELCA or balloon angioplasty. SETTING: Two university hospitals and one general hospital. RESULTS: There were no deaths. Myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery, and repeated angioplasty occurred in 4. 6, 10. 6, and 21. 2 %, respectively, of patients treated with ELCA compared with 5. 7, 10. 8, and 18. 5 %, respectively, of those treated with balloon angioplasty. ELCA did not yield a favourable clinical outcome in subgroups of patients with long (more than 20 mm) coronary lesions, calcified lesions, small diseased vessels (< or = 2. 5 mm <b>reference</b> <b>diameter),</b> or total coronary occlusions. There was a worse clinical outcome {{in patients with}} tandem lesions treated with ELCA compared with balloon angioplasty (9 / 18 v 3 / 26 lesions; p = 0. 01); while a trend towards an unfavourable clinical outcome was found in patients with vessels with a <b>reference</b> <b>diameter</b> of more than 2. 5 mm (23 / 66 v 13 / 63 lesions, p = 0. 07) and left circumflex coronary lesions (12 / 41 v 6 / 42 lesions, p = 0. 08).

Minimum luminal diameter (MLD), proximal <b>reference</b> <b>diameter</b> and distal <b>reference</b> <b>diameter</b> were measured for each lesion prior to stenting. Results: OCT was performed in 64 patients and 40 lesions were suitable for analysis. There was a good correlation for proximal and distal reference diameters (r =  0. 86, p <  0. 0001 and r =  0. 92, p <  0. 0001 respectively). There was good agreement on Bland–Altman analysis; the proximal and distal reference diameters measured by QCA were on average 0. 09  mm (95 % CI, − 0. 52 to 0. 53  mm) and 0. 1  mm (95 % CI, − 0. 59 to 0. 6  mm) smaller than OCT respectively.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{accuracy}} and precision of quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) software dedicated for bifurcation lesions compared with conventional single-vessel analysis remains unknown. Furthermore, comparison of different bifurcation analysis algorithms has not been performed. MethodsSix plexiglas phantoms with 18 bifurcations were manufactured with a tolerance < 10 mu m. The bifurcation angiograms were analyzed using Cardiovascular Angiography Analysis System (CAAS; Version 5. 10, Pie Medical Imaging, Maastricht, The Netherlands) and QAngio XA (Version 7. 3, Medis Medical Imaging System BV, Leiden, The Netherlands) software packages. ResultsConventional single-vessel analysis underestimated the <b>reference</b> vessel <b>diameter</b> and percent diameter stenosis in the proximal main vessel while it overestimated these parameters in the distal main vessel and side branch. CAAS software showed better overall {{accuracy and}} precision than QAngio XA (with automatic Y- or T-shape bifurcation algorithm selection) for various phantom diameters including minimum lumen diameter (0. 0120. 103 mm vs. 0. 041 +/- 0. 322 mm, P= 0. 003), <b>reference</b> vessel <b>diameter</b> (- 0. 050 +/- 0. 043 mm vs. 0. 116 +/- 0. 610 mm, P= 0. 026), and % diameter stenosis (- 0. 94 +/- 4. 07 % vs. 1. 74 +/- 7. 49 %, P= 0. 041). QAngio XA demonstrated higher minimal lumen <b>diameter,</b> <b>reference</b> vessel <b>diameter,</b> and % diameter stenosis {{when compared to the}} actual phantom diameters; however, the accuracy of these parameters improved to a similar level as CAAS when the sole T-shape algorithm in the QAnxio XA was used.

The initial gain index is the ratio between the gain in diameter during intervention and the theoretically achievable gain (i. e., <b>reference</b> <b>diameter).</b> The restenosis index is the ratio between the decrease at follow-up and the initial gain during the procedure.

40|$|Background—Restenosis {{remains the}} major {{limitation}} of coronary angioplasty. Coronary stents {{have reduced the}} incidence of restenosis in selected patients with relatively large vessels.

We have shown in the MultiVitamins and Probucol (MVP) Trial that probucol, a potent antioxidant, reduces restenosis after balloon angioplasty. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether the benefit of probucol therapy is maintained in the subgroup of patients with smaller coronary vessels. Methods and Results—We studied a subgroup of 189 patients included in the MVP trial who underwent successful balloon angioplasty of at least one coronary segment with a <b>reference</b> <b>diameter,</b> 3. 0 mm. One month before angioplasty, patients were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: placebo, probucol (500 mg), multivitamins (beta-carotene 30 000 IU, vitamin C 500 mg, and vitamin E 700 IU), or probucol plus multivitamins twice daily.

Polyp diameter was estimated during endoscopy by two observers independently. The phantom was then scanned using a 64 -detector-row machine and diameter estimated by a further two observers independently, using 2 D and 3 D visualisation methods. All measurements were obtained twice. Bland-Altman statistics were used to assess agreement between observers' estimates and the <b>reference</b> <b>diameter.</b> The mean difference between observers' measurements and the <b>reference</b> <b>diameter</b> was smallest for estimates made using 3 D CT (- 0. 09 mm and - 0. 03 mm) and greatest for endoscopy (- 1. 10 mm and - 1. 19 mm), with 2 D CT intermediate. However, 95 % limits of agreement were largest for 3 D CT estimates (- 4. 38 mm to 4. 20 mm). Estimates by 2 D CT consistently overestimated polyp diameter, whereas endoscopy consistently underestimated diameter. In contrast, measurements by 3 D CT were a combination of over- and under-estimates, with a tendency for disagreement to increase with the size of the polyp.

40|$|Objective: We {{sought to}} image {{coronary}} arteries in excised hearts. Methods: Twelve excised pigs' hearts were imaged {{in a water}} bath. The aortic valve was closed surgically. A contrast agent (Echovist) was Injected into the aortic root and selectively into single coronary arteries. Three-dimensional (3 D) imaging was performed with TomTec Echoscan equipment. Mechanical rotations were performed at 1 degrees intervals. The hearts were visualized by InVivo software. Selective coloring of coronary arteries in 3 D data sets was obtained by using color superpositioning, which differentiates information before and after injection of contrast. Distance measurements were performed in conventional 3 D echocardiograms of coronary arteries and color-superimposed echocardiograms and compared with those from angiograms and casts. Results: After a learning curve, during which optimal conditions for the visualization of coronary arteries were determined, a quick display of all major parts of the coronary tree was obtained. Distance measurements (n > 400) revealed that fundamental contrast echocardiography overestimated angiography by 25 % +/- 5 % and casts by 28 % +/- 6 %. However, distances in color-superimposed echocardiograms (flow mode 4) {{were not significantly different}} from those obtained from angiograms and casts. In harmonic contrast echocardiograms, color super-positioning gave smaller distances compared with those from fundamental contrast echocardiograms, though they were still significantly larger than the <b>reference</b> <b>diameters.</b> Conclusions: The 3 D Imaging of epicardial coronary arteries under ideal conditions in a water bath seems feasible and provides insight into coronary visualization with the use of ultrasonography...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of ten laser diffraction particle sizing instruments (Malvern models 2200 and 2600) has been evaluated using a synthetic particle size reference standard in a round-robin test at nine independent laboratories. A calibration reticle {{consisting of a}} two-dimensional array of opaque, circular particle images photoetched in chrome thin film deposited on a glass substrate {{was used as the}} <b>reference.</b> Mean <b>diameters</b> (e. g., D 32) for the reticle measured by the ten unmodified instruments varied by 27 percent. In contrast, data from six instruments with individually calibrated photodetector correction factors demonstrated much better agreement and were within 2. 6 percent of the actual reticle properties...|$|R
40|$|An {{automatic}} vessel diameter {{measurement technique}} based on {{linear discriminant analysis}} (LDA) has been proposed. After estimating the vessel wall, the vessel cross-section profile {{is divided into three}} regions: two corresponding to the background and one to the vessel. The algorithm was tested on more than 5000 cross-sections of retinal vessels from the REVIEW dataset through comparative study with the state-of-the-art techniques. Cross-correlation analyses were performed to determine {{the degree to which the}} proposed technique was close to the ground truth. The results indicate that proposed algorithm consistently performed better than most of other techniques and was highly correlated with the manual measurement as the <b>reference</b> <b>diameter.</b> The proposed method does not require any supervision and is suitable for automatic analysis...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : Randomized trials {{comparing}} {{invasive treatment}} of renal artery stenosis with standard pharmacotherapy {{did not show}} substantial benefit from revascularization. One of the potential reasons for that may be suboptimal procedure technique. Aim : To compare renal stent sizing using two modalities: three-dimensional renal computed tomography angiography (CTA) versus conventional angiography. Material and methods: Forty patients (41 renal arteries), aged 65. 1 ± 8. 5 years, who underwent renal artery stenting with preprocedural CTA performed within 6 months, were retrospectively analyzed. In CTA analysis, <b>reference</b> <b>diameter</b> (CTA-D) and lesion length (CTA_LL) were measured and proposed stent diameter and length were recorded. Similarly, angiographic <b>reference</b> <b>diameter</b> (ANGIO_D) and lesion length (ANGIO_LL) as well as proposed stent dimensions were obtained by visual estimation. Results: The median CTA_D was 0. 5 mm larger than the median ANGIO_D (p < 0. 001). Also, the proposed stent diameter in CTA evaluation was 0. 5 mm larger than that in angiography (p < 0. 0001). The median CTA_LL was 1 mm longer than the ANGIO_LL (p = NS), with significant correlation of these variables (r = 0. 66, p < 0. 0001). The median proposed stent length with CTA was equal to that proposed with angiography. The median diameter of the implanted stent was 0. 5 mm smaller than that proposed in CTA (p < 0. 0005) and identical to that proposed in angiography. The median length of the actual stent was longer than that proposed in angiography (p = 0. 0001). Conclusions : Renal CTA has potential advantages as a tool adjunctive to angiography in appropriate stent sizing. Careful evaluation of the available CTA scans may be beneficial and should be considered prior to the planned procedure...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) is {{a strong}} predictor of in-stent restenosis. This {{may be due to}} a higher level of vascular inflammation. We hypothesized that diabetic patients will benefit from dexamethasone-eluting stents, since local inflammation and consequently neointimal growth are suppressed and no systemic side effects will occur. Methods: 21 consecutive patients with DM with 32 lesions were treated with dexamethasone-eluting stents. Excluded were patients with triple vessel disease, bifurcation lesions, previous revascularization of the culprit vessel, and <b>reference</b> <b>diameter</b> smaller than 2. 5 or larger than 3. 75 mm. MACE (death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization) was counted at 12 months. At 6 months, angiographic follow-up was performed. Results: Of the patients, 38 % had insulin-dependent DM. Lesion type was type A/B 1 in 56 % and B 2 /C in 44 %. Lesion length was 15. 7 ± 8. 4 mm and the <b>reference</b> <b>diameter</b> was 2. 83 ± 0. 53 mm. Event-free survival at 12 months was 62 %. Any revascularization procedure was performed in 33 % and target lesion revascularization in 24 % of the patients. At 6 months in-stent late loss was 1. 07 ± 0. 64 mm. Binary restenosis occurred in 28. 1 % of the lesions. The event-free survival in insulin-dependent DM was worse compared to non-insulin-dependent DM (92. 1 vs. 37. 8 %; p < 0. 01). Patients with insulin-dependent DM had higher in-stent late loss compared to non-insulin-dependent DM patients (1. 44 ± 0. 83 vs. 0. 83 ± 0. 51 mm; p < 0. 01). Conclusion: Treatment with dexamethasone-eluting stents in patients with DM is associated with a relatively high restenosis rate. Our data suggest a differential effect of dexamethasone-eluting stents in insulin-dependent compared to non-insulin-dependent DM. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the safety and efficacy of the simpax stent in the treatmentof different patient groups. Patients and Methods: Forty-five patients were treated with the simpax stent. Of these patients, 23 patients gave consent for six months of follow-up by quantitative coronary angiography (QSA) and six patients were evaluated by exercise electrocardiographic test. Only the patients havinglesions with stenosis > 50 % of diameter and lengths > 16 mm with <b>reference</b> <b>diameters</b> < 2. 75 mm were included. Results: The device success rate was 100 % and procedure success rate was 97. 7 %. The meanstent length was 24. 6 ± 7. 3 mm and stent size was 2. 54 ± 0. 24 mm. The overall six months incidenceof major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was 8. 8 %. MACE was consisted of two casesof non-Q wave myocardial infarction and two cases of repeated revascularization of the targetlesion. MACE rate was higher in chronic total occlusion (CTO) group than non-CTO group (respectively 33. 3 % and 5. 1). Also when compared to stent size, MACE rate was 25 % in < 2. 5 mm, 0 % ≥ 2. 5 mm. The QSA results at six months showed in-stent late lumen loss witha diameter of 0. 25 ± 0. 15 mm in 17 patients. Conclusion: The six month results in this study demonsrated excellent procedural and devicesuccess. Simpax stent {{was associated with a}} low in-stent late lumen loss. Also this study showedsimpax stent was a safe and effective device in non-CTO group with stent size ≥ 2. 5 mm...|$|R
40|$|Recent histopathologic and {{intravascular}} ultrasound (IVUS) {{data indicate}} that inadequate compensatory enlargement of atherosclerotic lesions contributes {{to the development of}} significant arterial stenoses. Such lesions may contain less plaque, which may have implications for atheroablative interventions. In this study, we compared lesions with (group A, n = 16) and without inadequate compensatory enlargement (group B, n = 30) as determined by IVUS. The acute results and the follow-up lumen dimensions of angiographically successful directional coronary atherectomy procedures were compared. Inadequate compensatory enlargement was considered present when the preintervention arterial cross-sectional area at the target lesion site was smaller than that at the (distal) reference site. Three-dimensional IVUS analysis and quantitative angiography were performed in 46 patients before and after intervention. IVUS measurements included the arterial, lumen, and plaque (arterial minus lumen) cross-sectional areas at the target lesion site (i. e., smallest lumen site) and the (distal) reference site. Angiographic follow-up was performed in 42 patients. Preintervention and postintervention angiographic measurements and IVUS lumen cross-sectional area measurements were similar in both groups. However, at follow-up, the angiographic minimum lumen and <b>reference</b> <b>diameters</b> were significantly smaller in group A compared with group B (1. 71 +/- 0. 47 mm vs 2. 14 +/- 0. 73 mm, p < 0. 03, and 2. 97 +/- 0. 29 mm vs 3. 39 +/- 0. 76 mm, p < 0. 02; group A vs B). The data of this observational study suggest that lesions with inadequate compensatory enlargement, as determined by IVUS before intervention, may have less favorable long-term lumen dimensions after directional coronary atherectomy procedures...|$|R
40|$|Smaller {{studies have}} {{previously}} shown promising results after Tryton Side Branch Stent™ (Tryton Medical, Durham, NC, USA) placement. However, these previous studies were limited by their {{small sample size}} and relatively short follow-up. We performed a patient-level pooled analysis to evaluate six-month and one year clinical outcomes of more than 900 patients who were enrolled in eight registries with the Tryton stent. Data from eight Tryton registries, including 905 patients with 929 bifurcation lesions, were pooled on a patient level to form one dataset. The primary outcome was six-month target vessel failure (TVF), defined as the composite of cardiac death, any myocardial infarction, and clinically indicated target vessel revascularisation. Procedural success was defined as successful stent placement and no in-hospital major adverse cardiac events. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine independent predictors for one-year TVF. Follow-up data were available in 97 %. Procedural success was 95 % and TVF rate was 6. 5 % at six months and 8. 5 % at one year. Stent thrombosis occurred in 0. 5 % of patients. Left main coronary artery bifurcation lesion (HR 6. 46) and main branch <b>reference</b> vessel <b>diameter</b> < 3. 0 mm (HR 2. 62) were independent predictors for TVF. In the real world setting of registries including more than 900 patients, {{the use of the}} Tryton stent is associated with procedural and mid-term clinical results that compare very favourably with historical studies. The primary endpoint of TVF was primarily determined by <b>reference</b> vessel <b>diameter</b> of the main branch and left main bifurcation lesion locatio...|$|R
