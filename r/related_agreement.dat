40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the significance of}} the report made by WTO dispute settlement mechanism (a dispute settlement panel) concerning the dispute between the U. S. and Mexico over international telecommunications. In contrast to the former GATT structure, WTO system includes an agreement covering trade in services in the form of GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services). However, since there had been no decisions from dispute settlement procedures dealing directly with GATS, the real significance of the agreement was unclear. This case was therefore crucial to understanding the realities of GATS, especially since it dealt with telecommunications services, which {{are one of the most}} strictly regulated areas of trade in services. The decision showed that vague wording on the meaning of "cost-oriented rate" specified in <b>related</b> <b>agreements</b> had clear significance, that Annex on Telecommunications has an influence that extends to regulations on basic telecommunications services, and that GATS and <b>related</b> <b>agreements</b> and commitments place greater restrictions on states than has generally been imagined. The WTO dispute settlement panel demonstrated the severely restrictive nature of GATS, and this may cause delays in the progress of negotiations on trade in services currently under way. Widespread discussion of the appropriateness of this decision is therefore anticipated. ...|$|R

5000|$|After two {{regulations}} {{creating a}} European Union patent with unitary effect utilizing enhanced cooperation were approved for 25 participating states (all but Italy and Spain) by the European Parliament on 11 December 2012 the documents were formally adopted as regulation E.U. 1257 and 1260 of 2012 on 17 December 2012, and entered into force in January 2013. [...] However, the provisions will only apply once the <b>related</b> <b>Agreement</b> on a Unified Patent Court, which {{would create a}} common patent court for its members, enters into force. Due to a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union that the proposed Unified Patent Court (UPC) was not compatible with European Union law, the agreement calls for the court to be established by an intergovernmental treaty between the participating states outside {{the framework of the}} EU. [...] The draft Agreement was published by the Council of the European Union on 11 January 2013, and was signed on 19 February 2013 by 24 EU member states, including all states participating in the enhanced cooperation measures except Bulgaria and Poland, while Italy, which did not join the enhanced cooperation measures, did sign the UPC agreement. [...] The treaty is open for accession to all remaining EU member states, and Bulgaria subsequently signed the agreement on 5 March after finalizing their internal procedures. [...] Meanwhile, Poland decided to wait to see how the new patent system works before joining due to concerns that it would harm their economy. [...] While Italy is not participating in the unitary patent regulations, signing the UPC agreement will allow the new court to handle traditional European patents issued in the country. [...] Entry into force for the UPC will take place after 13 states (including Germany, France and the United Kingdom as the three states with the most patents in force) have ratified the Patent Court agreement, but not before 1 January 2014.|$|E

Second, we characterize a multi- factorial methodology according to Palestini and Pignataro (2014) to gauge the impact of redistribution and the effects of different income sources to the inequality profile. Finally, we propose an exercise where a hypothetical policy is implemented and we apply the Banzhaf and Shapley values to determine the marginal contributions of each factor to overall inequality...|$|E
