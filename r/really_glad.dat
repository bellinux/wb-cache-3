500|$|Overall, {{critics were}} {{satisfied}} with A Realm Reborns incremental improvements. Adam Harshberger of GamesRadar compared it to a [...] "buffet dinner [...] everyone's favorite meal", forgiving the lack of innovation. VanOrd likened the game to the [...] "old world" [...] of MMORPGs, safe and familiar.

500|$|TV Guide Adam Bryant {{called the}} scene with the bear [...] "one of the funniest moments on TV that week". Bryant also praised the story arc between Torres and Robbins, adding: [...] "I really like how honest Arizona is with Callie, {{and the way she}} puts the firecracker in her place." [...] He was {{positive}} of Leigh's performance, writing: [...] "Chyler Leigh gave a powerful performance in this episode.

From Meredith finally saying out loud how she feels about Lexie, to Lexie being at Mer's side when she wakes up, I am <b>really</b> <b>glad</b> to see these sisters' happy." [...] Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post gave a positive review of the episode, commenting: [...] "I love how Grey's Anatomy can bounce between serious and hysterical moments.

[...] Pascua also praised the writing of Waite's character's storyline and Leigh's performance.|$|E

Paul Rothchild played Kilmer's version of [...] "The End" [...] for the band's guitarist, Robby Krieger, who told him, [...] "I'm <b>really</b> <b>glad</b> they got 'The End'. We never got a recording of that live with Jim and now we've got it."

We appreciate it." ...|$|E

Adam Hawkins, an engineer during the Hurricane sessions, was also brought in to work on Vice Verses. The decision to work with Avron was influenced by recommendations from other bands {{who have worked with}} him in the past. [...] "Sean O'Donnell from Reeve Oliver, who's now in Yellowcard, [...] Jordan [...] from New Found Glory ," [...] explained Jon Foreman. [...] "They're both just like, 'You gotta meet him, and you're going to work with him.'
