However, during times of low rainfall periodic flooding is reduced.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} Neku {{by performing}} touchscreen actions {{based on the}} currently equipped pins. These actions may include slashing across an enemy, tapping the screen rapidly to fire bullets, holding down on an enemy to inflict damage or shouting into the microphone to cause a full screen attack. Other pins need to be touched to activate them, such as for health restoration. Each pin has {{a limited number of}} uses before it must <b>recharge</b> for a certain time. Other pins may only be used a fixed number of times during a series of battles, and do not <b>recharge</b> until the battle sequence is over. Neku can only be equipped with a maximum of two pins at the game's start; this can eventually be upgraded to a maximum of six.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper quantifies the <b>recharging</b> {{behaviour}} of {{a sample}} of electric vehicle (EV) drivers and evaluates the impact of current policy in the north east of England on EV driver <b>recharging</b> demand profiles. An analysis of 31, 765 EV trips and 7704 EV <b>recharging</b> events, constituting 23, 805 h of <b>recharging,</b> were recorded from in-vehicle loggers {{as part of the}} Switch EV trials is presented. Altogether 12 private users, 21 organisation individuals and 32 organisation pool vehicles were tracked over two successive six month trial periods. It was found that <b>recharging</b> profiles varied between the different user types and locations. Private users peak demand was in the evening at home <b>recharging</b> points. Organisation individual vehicles were <b>recharged</b> primarily upon arrival at work. Organisation pool users <b>recharged</b> at work and public <b>recharging</b> points throughout the working day. It is recommended that pay-as-you-go <b>recharging</b> be implemented at all public <b>recharging</b> locations, and smart meters be used to delay <b>recharging</b> at home and work locations until after 23 : 00 h to reduce peak demand on local power grids and reduce carbon emissions associated with EV <b>recharging...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} enrich campus card <b>recharging</b> methods {{and improve the}} cardholders experience, this paper first briefly {{introduces}} the campus card online <b>recharging</b> modes based on the third-party payment platform, then analyzes the business processes of the self-help <b>recharging</b> mode and the automatic <b>recharging</b> mode, introduces the validation processes of the transactions, and expounds the fund flows and the double reconciliation mechanism at last. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental investigation {{on the effectiveness}} of pulse <b>recharging</b> technique in recovering the lost capacity of nickel cadmium batteries (NiCad), through a comparison test with the conventional constant-current <b>recharging</b> technique. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis has been carried out on the electrodes of both pulse <b>recharged</b> and conventionally <b>recharged</b> NiCad cells after a controlled experimental process to restore the lost capacity due to shallow cycling. The results show that the pulse <b>recharging</b> technique performed equally well with the conventional <b>recharging</b> method in improving the topologies of the cell electrodes and recovering the lost capacity of the NiCad cells. The causes of capacity loss in NiCad batteries have also been investigated and the results obtained established the claim that shallow cycling enhances large and dendritic crystalline growth on the cell electrodes...|$|R
5|$|Several of {{the larger}} Death Valley springs derive their water from a {{regional}} aquifer, which extends as far east as southern Nevada and Utah. Much {{of the water in}} this aquifer has been there for many thousands of years, since the Pleistocene ice ages, when the climate was cooler and wetter. Today's drier climate does not provide enough precipitation to <b>recharge</b> the aquifer at the rate at which water is being withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Special {{abilities}} are another {{important aspect of}} Chocobo Racing. Before each race, the player is prompted to assign a special ability to the selected character. During a race, the player can only activate the chosen special ability when the meter in the upper left-hand corner of the screen is full. After using the special ability, the player must wait for the meter to <b>recharge</b> to use it again.|$|E
5|$|The Taken are {{protected}} by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or {{wait for it to}} <b>recharge</b> slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may <b>recharge</b> over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.|$|E
40|$|<b>Recharging</b> through radio {{frequency}} (RF) pulses is a promising approach {{to enhance the}} lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we propose a polling-based MAC protocol with round robin scheduling under E-limited service policy. In this model, the WSN coordinator sends a <b>recharging</b> pulse upon reception of a <b>recharging</b> request {{from one of the}} nodes. As both <b>recharging</b> and data communication use the same RF band, the latter process is interrupted by the former. A probabilistic model for energy depletion within the proposed MAC along with queueing delay model is evaluated as well. Later, we assess the behaviour of time interval between two consecutive <b>recharging</b> events and packet waiting time under varying network size and traffic load...|$|R

30|$|Constraints (17) {{impose the}} charger {{capacity}}, by restricting the amount <b>recharged</b> into each PEV {{based on the}} capacity of the charger. Constraints (18) impose the driving pattern, by only allowing each PEV to be <b>recharged</b> while it is parked (i.e., between hours ϕ _v^A and ϕ _v^D). Finally, constraints (19) force each PEV to be fully <b>recharged</b> before leaving its charging station.|$|R
5|$|The {{existing}} electrical grid, {{and local}} transformers in particular, {{may not have}} enough capacity to handle the additional power load that might be required in certain areas with high plug-in electric car concentrations. As recharging a single electric-drive car could consume {{three times as much}} electricity as a typical home, overloading problems may arise when several vehicles in the same neighborhood <b>recharge</b> at the same time, or during the normal summer peak loads. To avoid such problems, utility executives recommend owners to charge their vehicles overnight when the grid load is lower or to use smarter electric meters that help control demand. When market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles begins to reach significant levels, utilities will have to invest in improvements for local electrical grids in order to handle the additional loads related to recharging to avoid blackouts due to grid overload. Also, some experts have suggested that by implementing variable time-of-day rates, utilities can provide an incentive for plug-in owners to <b>recharge</b> mostly overnight, when rates are lower.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{energy system}} gives players 5 energy {{points at the}} start. Beginning a run in any mode costs one point, and it takes 10 minutes for a point to <b>recharge.</b> Players can pay to refill energy by {{spending}} ISO-8s. Players can make friends at the leaderboard; once per day they can send and request 5 energy points, which are stored in their inboxes.|$|E
5|$|The time to <b>recharge</b> Lake Missoula {{depends upon}} {{the level at which}} the dam is {{breached}} releasing the flood as well as upon the adjusted precipitation rate in the drainages flowing into Lake Missoula. For the volumes which correspond to calculated maximum flow rates, this is estimated to take from 20 to 80 years.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>recharging</b> battery, or an {{electrolytic}} cell, the anode is {{the positive}} terminal, which receives current from an external generator. The current through a <b>recharging</b> battery is opposite to {{the direction of}} current during discharge; in other words, the electrode which was the cathode during battery discharge becomes the anode while the battery is <b>recharging.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Batteries {{should always}} be <b>recharged</b> in the <b>recharger</b> and not within the mobile phone. <b>Recharging</b> in the mobile takes longer and the standby time will be halved. The short standby time and <b>recharging</b> error {{may be caused by}} faulty {{firmware}} or a faulty 3G network. In addition the battery time can be increased by turning off the GPS and vibra call alert, and by turning down the backlight of the display. Testing has revealed that using the phone in 2G network will provide 3-4 times the standby time than using it in 3G networks.|$|R
5|$|There {{are four}} levels of {{difficulty}} in campaign mode: Easy, Normal, Heroic, and Legendary. An increase in difficulty {{will result in}} an increase in the number, rank, health, damage, and accuracy of enemies; a reduction of duration and an increase in <b>recharge</b> time for the Arbiter's active camouflage; a decrease in the player's health and shields; and occasional changes in dialog.|$|E
5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to <b>recharge</b> the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to <b>recharge</b> the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years into}} Superman's regime, the {{insurgency}} discovers a parallel universe where Joker's plan failed, and they teleport that world's Wonder Woman (Susan Eisenberg), Aquaman (Phil LaMarr), Green Arrow (Alan Tudyk), and Green Lantern (Adam Baldwin) into their universe. Batman and Joker are accidentally transported as well, but are separated after {{an encounter with}} the regime's military forces. While searching for somewhere to <b>recharge</b> his power ring, Green Lantern encounters Sinestro (Troy Baker) and his Yellow Lantern counterpart. Aquaman visits the archives of Atlantis, where he discovers how Superman descended into tyranny and that Atlantis has agreed to complete subjugation under Superman. He is then forced to fight his counterpart as well.|$|E

5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster <b>recharge</b> of shields, afterburners, and weapons {{at the expense}} of other subsystems. These features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay. The mission parameters are not rigidly fixed, as there is an allowance for the failures of some primary objectives. When the mission is concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss the mission, and the performance of the player, before the next mission can be taken on.|$|E

5|$|There are a {{total of}} five Monsters {{featured}} in Evolve. Similar to the Hunters, players need to inflict a certain amount of damage before unlocking a new Monster. The five different Monster-types also have different abilities, both offensive and defensive. Players control the Monster from a third-person perspective, and it features gameplay similar to an action game, unlike the Hunters. More abilities are given to a Monster after its evolution. Gameplay mechanics do not change much after the release of Stage 2, but monsters are made more powerful. They are given more health, stamina, armor, and skill points to unlock all abilities. Cooldown time abilities also shortened and <b>recharge</b> rate becomes significantly faster.|$|E
5|$|A {{river is}} a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up {{completely}} before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river {{is said to be}} larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language. A river is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater <b>recharge,</b> springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).|$|E
