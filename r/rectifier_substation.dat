40|$|HVDC {{technology}} is increasingly important for long distance bulk power transmission, but existing protection relaying techniques {{for such a}} system are subject to limitations. This paper presents a novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on an algorithm for fault detection, location and classification in VSC-HVDC systems. Taking advantage of the ability of ANNs to identify and classify patterns, the proposed algorithm is able to detect and correctly classify a fault occurring at either the <b>rectifier</b> <b>substation</b> on the DC line or at the inverter substation. Therefore, such a scheme {{can be used as}} a decision support tool or as a backup protection. Only local signals are used at the <b>rectifier</b> <b>substation</b> and no communication link is necessary, thus improving the system’s protection reliability and reducing the overall cost of the hardware implementation. A detailed VSC-HVDC system is described and used to simulate a number of fault scenarios in the system. Using the resulting fault waveforms, a comprehensive decision support scheme is developed and described, paying particular attention to the signal processing chain and design of the specific ANNs for each relaying task. Finally, a detailed analysis of the influence of key fault parameters on the limits of the algorithm’s performance is carried out...|$|E
40|$|Subway {{system is}} one of the {{critical}} infrastructures in a society. In economic optimizations of risk control measures, valuing the loss of life and other financial losses in terms of money on the other hand, could influence the optimal investments in safety. The purpose is to contribute to the implementation of HSE in the transportation system. In this research, a fire risk assessment along with its economic loss estimation in the Direct Current (DC) trains and <b>rectifier</b> <b>substation</b> (RS) of Tehran subway is implemented. The number of fatalities, the extent of damage on the train equipment, etc., is then calculated in monetary unit. By using Event Tree Analysis (herein ETA), after identification of initiating events through observation, interviews, and evaluation of documents, event tree was constructed for each of them and the probability of multiple scenarios were computed. The scenario with the highest probability of fire in RS, including increased heats in the RTU panels generate a loss of at least 730 Million Rials. Accordingly, the minimum and maximum economic loss caused by fire on DC trains is minimum 510 and 1230 Million Rials, respectively. Conclusion: Given the findings of this study, the financial and human life risks, along with all tangible and intangible losses, which is considerable, the relevant managers must compare investments in safety, with the decrease of calculated economic risks as a result of fire accident in Tehran subway...|$|E

30|$|Power network solver for DC railway {{power supply}} {{is one of}} the most {{essential}} parts in the multi-train simulation in order to analyze, simulate, design, and control the steady-state train service. Although there exist several powerful power flow solvers based on the conventional Newton–Raphson method, their problem formulation gives complication due to the need to calculate derivatives in the Jacobian matrix. The simplified Newton–Raphson method uses non-linear current mismatch equations instead of the commonly used power mismatches to simplify overall equation complexity. In addition, a total number of multiplication operations required by the conventional method is linearly proportional to the size of the Jacobian matrix, while that of the proposed method is nearly constant. This means that the calculation time of the conventional method increases more rapidly as the total bus number increases than that of the proposed method does. This can lead to improvement of multi-train simulation software development in fast computational speed and less memory usage. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, BTS—Sukhumvit line in Bangkok, Thailand is selected as the test system. It consists of 22 passenger stopping stations, 10 <b>rectifier</b> <b>substation,</b> and the total line length is 21.6 -km. The rated voltage of the power feeding system is 750 VDC. The test-case scenario is assumed at the speed limit of 80  km/h with the 5 -minute headway. The simulation is conducted with one-hour service operation. The train service with the given headway spends just over 30  min to reach the steady train service operation. The result shows that the total bus number of the entire system can vary in between 21 and 24 at the steady train service. As a result, the SNR shows the best performance among the four methods in the execution time. It is about 18  % and 6  % faster than the CNR and the CIM, respectively.|$|E

5000|$|A {{large amount}} of {{preparation}} works were undertaken in the Wellington region to allow the units to operate: clearances in tunnels, at platforms and under some bridges had to be increased to take the new trains. KiwiRail installed eleven new <b>rectifier</b> <b>substations</b> to increase the electrical supply for the new trains (nine on existing electrified lines, and two on the new extension to Waikanae), and hardened the signalling system against interference from their AC traction equipment. The operating voltage was increased to 1600 volts DC to maximise the power available. Despite the power upgrades the length of Matangi trains was initially limited {{to a maximum of}} six cars out of concern for the load long trains would have on the power supply. [...] Testing performed by Tranz Metro and KiwiRail in September 2011 with eight-car sets in revenue service on the Hutt Valley and Kapiti Lines found that the network is able to cope with a limited number of long trains (one at a time on the Hutt Valley line and two on the Kapiti line) resulting in eight-car trains being permitted.|$|R

40|$|A DC {{high voltage}} ground fault relay (64 P), {{one of the}} feeding {{protection}} systems of DC railway substations, is a device for monitoring the voltage (the difference in potential) between the grounding mat of the substation and the return wire corresponding to the rail. If a ground fault occurs within a substation, it also detects the voltage rise and immediately sends out an open command to related circuit breakers to stop the supply of power {{to the point of}} the ground fault. However, some ground faults can cause damage to surrounding facilities as well as the point of the accident. At the same time, they could also possibly hamper ground fault protection due to contact fault with auxiliary energizing sources, spreading the damage. We have therefore conducted development of a ground fault protective relay that needs no auxiliary energizing source (DC 110 V) to drive the protection device with an aim of improving reliability of ground fault protection. 2. 1 DC Feeding System In a DC feeding system, DC 1, 500 V (standard voltage) stepped down from 66 kV special high voltage and rectified by a <b>rectifier</b> at <b>substations</b> is supplied to feeders and contact wires as shown in Fig. 1.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the fault states of twelve-pulse <b>rectifier</b> in {{traction}} <b>substation</b> of 3 kV DC traction system used at railways in the Czech Republic. The situation at diode breakdown of rectifier {{and at the same}} time recuperative traction vehicles in power supply section. The vehicle with recuperation can increase stress of elements in power supply system under certain conditions during fault states of rectifier. The simulation computer model was created for analysis of current waveforms in trolley line at this situation. The all simulations were done by program PSpice. The main goal is to analyze the endanger elements of power supply system and bring the recommendation for increasing of reliability of this mentioned power supply system. In the first part of this paper, the values of short-circuit currents flowing through 3 kV DC traction system were numerically simulated. Independently the situation, when the short-circuit DC current flowing through the secondary winding of the transformer, was analyzed. The inductances of this transformer slow down the rise of DC short-circuit current. However, in the first stage of the rise of this DC short-circuit current, the leakage inductances of the transformer which allow a rapid rise of this current, become evident. The whole interval of rise of the short-circuit current at the real transformer is further reduced by the effect of oversaturation of the magnetic circuit at connection to the DC source. It is possible to conclude by the theory of the circuits that the worst situation is in the case of vehicle with recuperation very close to the traction substation when the short-circuit current is not limited by the resistors of the traction line. The simulations show, the voltage drop on the pantograph below 2 kV occurs by this close short-circuit. The vehicle has a good opportunity to recognize this non-standard situation and stop the recuperation. Potentially the most hazard situations can be considered, when vehicle with recuperation is close enough to pass through the catenary the high current, but far enough that the voltage on the pantograph does not fall below 2 kV. If the DC source in the contact line passes through the higher current to the traction substation than the set of high-speed circuit breaker, it will be turned off this circuit breaker. The current values by the effect of the inductances in the circuit reach their steady maximum. This situation is dangerous especially for the machine isolator (circuit breaker) located between 3 kV DC bus and the damaged rectifier. The circuit breaker starts to disconnect immediately after the switch off of the primary switch of the transformer (responding to diode breakdown in the rectifier). Therefore, it is always appropriate to add the protection to the rectifier evaluating the direction of the DC current flow. This protection is already installed in some built traction substations. Usage of this protection makes sure disconnection of the damaged rectifier unit from the catenary. The only vehicles, that would recuperative even if very low value of voltage at the pantograph, could complicate this situation (i. e. the situation of recuperation close the traction substation when the current flowing back to the traction substation could be up to tens of milliseconds with very high values). The recuperation at the low catenary voltage is always suitable interrupt from viewpoint of protection of traction substation from dangerous current flow back to this traction substation.
