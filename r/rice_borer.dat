50|$|Since crambids are {{relatively}} common throughout human settlements, the moths tend to affect crops and gardens, whether harmfully, beneficially or harmlessly. Beneficial crambids include the water hyacinth moth (Niphograpta albiguttalis), {{used to control}} its host (Eichhornia crassipes), the water veneer (Acentria ephemerella), a biocontrol agent used against Eurasian watermilfoil), and the bamboo borer (Omphisa fuscidentalis), of which the caterpillars are used for human consumption (see entomophagy).

Information on the biology of L. jalisco is scarce and indispensable for its propagation in captivity and understanding of L. jalisco-E. loftini interactions. Parasitoid longevity, reproductive biology and immature development were studied under laboratory conditions. At 22 C, honey-fed mated adults lived about two weeks whereas lifespan of unmated individuals averaged three weeks. Females of L. jalisco emerged with a complement of eggs that continued to develop during the first days following emergence. Mating was necessary for embryonic development. After copulation, eggs were fertilized and gradually transferred to an elongated ovisac where they incubated for about one week before hatching. Hatching occurred in the female’s reproductive tract, an attribute of true ovoviviparous repro-duction. First instar larvae were available for oviposition during the female’s entire lifetime. Egg load increased with adult female size; mean lifetime potential fecundity was 400 140 eggs per female. Parasitoids successfully developed on second to sixth instar host larvae...|$|E

Insect resistant transgenic sugarcane producing Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) was developed to improve control of E. loftini. The present laboratory study addressed whether transgenic sugarcane adversely affects parasitism of E. loftini by P. pyralophagus. Females of P. pyralophagus preferentially probed, drilled, and parasitized E. loftini larvae fed artificial diet based on conventional sugarcane versus larvae fed diet based on transgenic sugarcane. Activity levels of E. loftini were reduced when fed diet based on transgenic sugarcane, but no differences were evident in frass volatile profiles.

However, {{it was concluded that}} this may not significantly affect control of E. loftini because (1) while E. loftini larvae that are most susceptible to transgenic sugarcane may be less prone to parasitism by P. pyralophagus, {{they are less likely to}} cause severe crop damage and reproduce successfully; and (2) those E. loftini larvae least susceptible to transgenic sugarcane, and therefore more active and damaging to plants, may be more prone to parasitism by P. pyralophagus...|$|E
40|$|Sugarcane, Saccharum spp., in the United States is {{attacked}} {{by a number of}} different arthropod pests. The most serious among those pests are two stalk boring moths in the Family Crambidae: the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.), and the Mexican <b>rice</b> <b>borer,</b> Eoreuma loftini (Dyar). The two species are affected by abiotic and biotic environmental stress factors. Water deficit and excessive soil nitrogen alter physical and physiochemical aspects of the sugarcane plant that make the crop increasingly vulnerable to E. loftini. Weed growth can be competitive with sugarcane but it also supports enhanced abundances and diversity of natural enemies that can suppress infestations of D. saccharalis. In an instance where the stalk borer is considered a stress factor, proximity of vulnerable crops to sugarcane can influence levels of E. loftini infestation of sugarcane. The adverse effects of each stress factor, in terms of stalk borer attack, can be reduced by adopting appropriate cultural practices, such as adequate irrigation, judicious use of nitrogen fertilizer, using noncompetitive weed growth, and not planting vulnerable crops near sugarcane fields. Understanding the relationships between stress factors and crop pests can provide valuable insights for plant breeders and tools for incorporation into integrated pest management strategies...|$|E

The {{results of this study}} showed that a number of life history parameters were affected by transgenic, sugarcane, whereas others were not affected, and that effects varied between generations. In the first generation, adult longevity was increased by approximate to 2 d, and cocoon to adult and egg to adult developmental times were prolonged by approximate to 1 d in parasitoids exposed to transgenic sugarcane, whereas effects were not evident on adult size; egg load; egg to cocoon developmental time; rates of gain of longevity and egg load with adult size; and egg, larval, and pupal mortality.

When the ficus branch were treated by 2, 4, 5 T., a kind of plant hormones, a few lower fruits riped in a week or so, while the other younger fruits and adults leaves were markedly damaged. To escape those unfavorable effects, therefore, lower three fruits alone were treated. The results were very favoreble in the treatment of 0. 1 - 0. 02 %. 2. Devices of killing methods of <b>rice</b> <b>borers.</b> The writer fixed four glass plates to neon lump. Using it, the killing percentage of <b>rice</b> <b>borers</b> can be markedly increased. Observing the damage of <b>rice</b> <b>borers</b> in the ripening period, we were surprised to find that the percentage of attacked stems were very high and decrease of seed weight were considerably severe in intolerant varieties.

The writer observed the severe dameges by the sterility of rice plants caused by the cool temperature, exploring at the mountain distric of Bantai. In this investigation he caught the important facts thet the rice plants have critical stages to the cool tempreature 17 - 18 ℃ before heading as well as at heading, To detect the stages, many post of rice plants were alternately put in cool spring water 17 - 18 ℃ for a week. 4. Role of vacuoles in the rice plants tissue as oxgen passages to the root. Several upper lengthend internodes have no vacuole in their tissue while the lower ones have apparent vacuoles. When the writer observed whether the atmost internode which developed the roots has any vacuole in the tissue, he found that the development of roots and vacuoles in the stem coincides aimost completely which suggests the vacuoles may act the role of Oxgen passages to the roots. 5. Barley rot under snow covered. Whether barley rot under snow covered was of physiological or of fungus invasion had not formerly been clear. The writer carried out experiments in both districts, snow covered and dry hardy.
