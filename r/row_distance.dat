50|$|In an {{alternate}} {{view of the}} problem, we can consider the invariant to be {{the sum of the}} parity of the number of inversions in the current order of the 15 numbered pieces and the parity of the difference in the row number of the empty square from the row number of the last row. (Let's call it <b>row</b> <b>distance</b> from the last row.) This is an invariant because each column move, when we move a piece within the same column, changes both the parity of the number of inversions (by changing the number of inversions by ±1, ±3) and the parity of the <b>row</b> <b>distance</b> from the last row (changing <b>row</b> <b>distance</b> by ±1); and each row move, when we move a piece within the same row, does not change any of the two parities. Now {{if we look at the}} solved state of the puzzle, this sum is even. Hence it is easy to prove by induction that any state of the puzzle for which the above sum is odd cannot be solvable. In particular, if the empty square is in the lower right corner (even anywhere in the last row) then the puzzle is solvable if and only if the number of inversions of the numbered pieces is even.|$|E

These effects were {{studied in the}} spring of 2000 at the Agricultural Research Station, Isfahan University of Technology, using a randomized complete block design with a split plot layout and three replications. Main plots consisted of three row distances (30 cm flat, and 45 and 60 cm on bed), and sub-plots included three planting densities (30, 40, and 50 plants m- 2). The experiment was planted on March 13 using local safflower variety of Isfahan, named Koseh. Increase in <b>row</b> <b>distance</b> and plant density enhanced most developmental stages of safflower. Leaf area index was not significantly affected by <b>row</b> <b>distance</b> but increased as planting density increased. Up to the 50 % flowering stage, 30 cm <b>row</b> <b>distance</b> produced highest plant dry weight, but had the least dry weight {{at the end of the}} growing season, probably due to the strong shedding of leaves. Up to the end of flowering stage, 50 plants m- 2 treatment produced the highest plant dry weight, but ranked lower as compared to 30 plants m- 2 treatment at the physiological maturity, probably due to the shedding of leaves. <b>Row</b> <b>distance</b> had no significant effect on number of branches per plant and per square meter, number of heads per branch, number of seeds per head, 1000 -seed weight and harvest index. But number of heads per plant and per square meter as well as seed yield per plant and per square meter significantly decreased as planting distance increased. Plant density had no significant effect on number of branches per plant, number of heads per square meter, number of seeds per head, 1000 -seed weight and seed yield. Increase in planting density increased number of branches per square meter, but reduced number of heads per branch and per plant, seed yield per plant and harvest index. The highest seed yield (4769 kg ha- 1) was obtained with 30 cm <b>row</b> <b>distance</b> and 40 plants m- 2 treatment. On average, 397 kg ha- 1 petal was harvested, which has a large economic value.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{decisions}} in crop production is the choice of <b>row</b> <b>distance</b> and plant density. The choice of these planting pattern parameters is especially challenging in heterogeneous systems, such as systems containing alternating strips. Here we use functional-structural plant modelling {{to address the problem}} of identifying optimal row distances and plant density in a heterogeneous crop system. We compare radiation capture in sole cotton and relay strip cotton, remaining after harvest of wheat from a wheat-cotton relay strip intercrop. We compare light interception in the two systems under different scenarios of <b>row</b> <b>distance</b> and plant density. Light interception calculations with the functional-structural plant model were evaluated using field observations. Light interception by cotton was mainly determined by row distances and to a lesser extent by plant density. Light interception was reduced by the gaps between the strips in strip cotton. Plant density (per unit area of the whole system) providing maximum light interception was lower in relay strip cotton than in normal cotton. Plastic responses of cotton to canopy heterogeneity, accounted for in the model, did not result in full radiation capture in strip cotton. The gaps between the rows in strip cotton allowed light penetration to deeper canopy layers relevant for the reduction of fruit abortion rate. We conclude that relay strip cotton cannot attain the same light interception as sole cotton, due to the gaps between the strips. Increasing plant density was insufficient to bridge the gap. Thus, the maximum light interception in strip cotton is lower than in sole cotton, and is achieved at a lower overall plant density. FSP modelling provided a suitable tool to identify <b>row</b> <b>distance</b> and plant densities providing high light interception in a heterogeneous canopy. </p...|$|E
