First, we quantify the connection between attack channel estimation accuracy and detection performance. Second, we show how to design watermarks that minimize probability of error of the detector. Evaluation of the optimal likelihood ratio test is often computationally expensive, so as a practical alternative, we propose a family of quadratic detectors and construct the detector and family of watermarks that maximize the <b>deflection</b> <b>criterion.</b> For delay attacks, the <b>deflection</b> <b>criterion</b> is shown to increase quadratically with the duration of the host signal. For warping attacks, the <b>deflection</b> <b>criterion</b> increases proportionally to the duration of the signal and proportionally to the coherence time of the warping function.

40|$|Thin {{surfaced}} asphalts {{are designed}} {{in a similar}} manner to spray sealed asphalts considering only rutting as the major mode of failure while there is no consideration for fatigue in the current mechanistic empirical pavement design method adopted by Austroads. However, sprayed seal surfacing are less sensitive to vertical deflection compared to thin surfaced asphalts. Thin surfaced asphalts are commonly prematurely failed by fatigue before any major rutting failure. In this research, the Austroads tolerable <b>deflection</b> <b>criteria</b> was investigated utilizing deflection and cumulative traffic data from 30 thin asphalt pavement sections from Queensland. The data showed that the current Austroads tolerable <b>deflection</b> <b>criterion</b> is largely overestimating the design life of these pavement sections. A new calibrated tolerable <b>deflection</b> <b>criterion</b> was developed. The calibrated tolerable <b>deflection</b> <b>criterion</b> was used with synthetic deflection data and pavement responses generated by multilayer elastic analysis using Circly software for 200 pavement sections to develop a new subgrade criterion. The new subgrade criterion is designed to limit the maximum pavement deflection to be within the calibrated tolerable deflection. By limiting the maximum deflection of the thin asphalt pavements to the new calibrated tolerable deflection, it is expected that surface curvature will be reduced and therefore the fatigue life of these pavements will be significantly improved and it will limit the premature failures of these surfaces. The new criterion produces a stiffer pavement structure compared to the current method. The high stiffness can be achieved by using thicker base course or stabilized bases and subbases structures...|$|R

40|$|Cantilevers are {{a popular}} {{way to express}} form and create unique feature spaces. From a design perspective, {{cantilevers}} are amazing feats for the built environment, and structurally, present many opportunities. However, conceptual cantilever design can be a difficult task for Architects and Structural Engineers {{because there are many}} structural systems or strategies designers could choose to carry loads to supports. This thesis begins with examples of built cantilevers which are distilled into five categories of structural systems. These structural systems serve as the beginning of the design process. In addition to choosing a structural system, there are many parameters of a cantilever that can be altered that all impact the overall structural performance to varying degrees. This thesis proposes to study these parameters to better understand how they relate to one another through analytical derivations of global deflection and member forces. Secondly, with these analytical relationships, this thesis attempts to quantitatively measure the effectiveness of each structural system through an optimization sequence that takes into account both material use and <b>deflection</b> <b>criteria.</b> This method of optimization can then be applied to particular examples and be used as a systematic approach to conceptual cantilever design. A design example is optimized for material weight while satisfying a given <b>deflection</b> <b>criteria,</b> as a way to illustrate the differences between each structural system. by Lingxiao Han.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects by crash related car parameters on head and chest injury measures for 3 - and 12 -year-old children in near side impacts. Methods: The evaluation was made by using a model of a complete passenger car which was impacted laterally by a barrier. The car model was validated in two crash conditions: the IIHS and the USNCAP side impact tests. The SID-IIs and the HBM 3 (THUMS 3 -yo) finite element models were used for the parametric investigation (HBM 3 on a booster). The car parameters were: vehicle mass, side impact structure stiffness, a head airbag, a thorax-pelvis airbag, and a seat belt with pretensioner. The studied dependent variables were: resultant head linear acceleration, resultant head rotational acceleration, chest viscous <b>criterion,</b> <b>rib</b> <b>deflection,</b> and relative velocity at head impact. The chest measurements were only considered for the SID-IIs. Results: The head airbag had the greatest effect on the head measurements for both of the occupant models. On average, it reduced the peak head linear acceleration by 54 g for the HBM 3 and 78 g for the SID-IIs. The seat belt had the second greatest effect on the head measurements; the peak head linear accelerations were reduced on average by 39 g (HBM 3) and 44 g (SID-IIs). The high stiffness side structure increased the SID-IIs head acceleration, while it had marginal effect on the HBM 3. The vehicle mass had marginal effect on SID-IIs head accelerations, while the lower vehicle mass caused 18 g higher head acceleration for HBM 3 and the greatest rotational acceleration. The thorax-pelvis airbag, the vehicle mass and the seat belt pretensioner affected the chest measurements the most. The presence of a thorax-pelvis airbag, high vehicle mass and a seat belt pretensioner all reduced the chest VC and peak <b>rib</b> <b>deflection</b> in the SID-IIs. Conclusions: The head and thorax-pelvis airbags have the potential to reduce injury measurements for both the SID-IIs and the HBM 3, provided that the airbag properties are designed to consider these occupant sizes also. The seat belt pretensioner is also effective, provided that the lateral translation of the torso is managed by other features. The importance of lateral movement management is greater the smaller the occupant is. Light vehicles require interior restraint systems of higher performance than heavy vehicles do to achieve the same level of injury measures for a given side structure...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the injury mechanism of pedestrian chests in collisions with passenger vehicles of various frontal shapes and examining {{the influence of the}} local structural stiffness on the chest injury risk by using the headform impact test at the chest contact area of the vehicle. Three simulations of vehicle to pedestrian collisions were conducted using three validated pedestrian finite element (FE) models of three pedestrian heights of 177 (AM 50 th), 165 and 150 cm and three FE vehicles,models representing a one-box vehicle, a minicar and a medium car. The validity of the vehicle models was evaluated by comparing the headform acceleration against the measured responses from headform impact tests. The chest impact kinematics and the injury mechanisms were analyzed in terms of the distribution of the von Mises stress of the ribcage {{and in terms of the}} chest deflections. The chest contact locations on the front panel and the bonnet top were identified in connection to the causation of rib fractures. The risk of rib fractures was predicted by using the von Mises stress distribution. The headform impact tests were carried out at the chest contact area on the front panel and bonnet to examine the safety performance with respect to pedestrian chest protection. In simulations of the one-box vehicle to pedestrian collisions, the chest was struck directly by the frontal structure at a high velocity and deformed substantially, since a shear force was generated by the stiff windshield frame. The acceleration of the headform was related to the <b>rib</b> <b>deflections.</b> The injury threshold of the ribcage deflection (42 mm) corresponded to the headform average acceleration of 68 G. In the minicar collision, the chest was struck with the bonnet top and cowl area at a low velocity, and the deformation was small due to the distributed contact force between the chest and the bonnet top. Besides, the ribcage deformation was too small for bridging a relation between the headform accelerations and <b>rib</b> <b>deflections.</b> In the medium car collision, the deformation mode of the chest was similar to that in the minicar collision. The chest collided with the bonnet top at a low velocity and deformed uniformly. The <b>deflection</b> of the <b>ribs</b> had an observable correlation with the headform accelerations measured in the headform impact tests. The frontal shape of a vehicle has a large influence on a pedestrian's chest loadings, and the chest deformation depends on the size of the pedestrian and the stiffness of the vehicle. The one-box passenger vehicle causes a high chest injury risk. The headform impactor test can be utilized for the evaluation of the local stiffness of a vehicle's frontal structure. The reduction of the headform acceleration is an effective measure for pedestrian chest protection for specific shapes of vehicles by efficacy in modifying the local structural stiffness...|$|R

40|$|An earlier {{model for}} the study of rib cage {{mechanics}} was modified so that rib deformity in scoliosis could be better represented. The rigid ribs of that model were replaced by five-segment deformable rits. Literature data on cadaver rib mechanical behavior were used to assign stiffnesses to the new individual model ribs so that experimental and model <b>rib</b> <b>deflections</b> agreed. Shear and tension/compression stiffnesses had little effect on individual rib deformation, but bending stiffnesses had a major effect. Level-to-level differences in mechanical behavior could be explained almost exclusively by level to level differences in the rib shape. The model ribs were then assembled into a whole rib cage. Computer simulations of whole rib cage behaviors, both in vivo and in vitro, showed a reasonable agreement with the measured behaviors. The model was used to study rib cage mechanics in two scolioses, one with a 43 [deg] and the other with a 70 [deg] Cobb angle. Scoliotic rib cage deformities were quantified by parameters measuring the rib cage lateral offset, rib cage axial rotation, rib cage volume and rib distortion.

The methodology {{is based on the}} coupled and complementary use of two software packages: PreScan and Madymo. PreScan was utilized for designing two traffic scenarios and the sensing and control systems for the side collision recognition, while Madymo was utilized for assessing the effects of pre-crash deployment of thorax airbag. The collision conditions from the scenarios were used as input to define a Madymo side collision model of the host vehicle and to investigate and optimize several airbag deployment parameters: pre-crash deployment time, airbag permeability, vent hole size and vent hole opening time. Results showed that the best system configuration to reduce occupant injuries is achieved when the airbag is deployed in the pre-crash phase to push away the driver from the intrusion zone in {{the first phase of the}} crash. Then a delayed vent hole opening softly separates the driver from the contact with the door structure when it intrudes. The proposed deployment strategy led to reduction of <b>rib</b> <b>deflection</b> and VC injury measures of 20 % and 50 % respectively, showing the potential of integrating active and passive safety methodologies to improve the occupant protection in case of side collision...|$|R

The bridge superstructure was designed by placing Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) decks onto four FRP I-girders that served as the bridge girders. Bridge diaphragms and FRP rods placed between the girders helped dissipate the loading to the other girders and prevent torsion respectively. The pultruded GFRP composite profiles were used in constructing this bridge located in the Taijiang National Park of Taiwan. This paper discusses the features of the pedestrian bridge and the detailed design of all the components of the bridge. A new method of digitally archiving the pedestrian bridge using a 3 D terrestrial laser scanner was also presented. Lastly, results of the theoretical analysis were compared with the finite element analysis (FEA), to predict the static flexural behavior of an 8 -m girder under loadings. After agreement of the theoretical results (using Timoshenko Beam Theory and Euler–Bernoulli Beam Theory) and the FEA results, the pedestrian bridge superstructure was modeled and analyzed. Deflection results obtained from the FEA showed that the pedestrian bridge meets the <b>deflection</b> <b>criteria...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Diagonal and {{toroidal}} mesh are degree- 4, {{point to}} point interconnection models suitable for connecting communica-tion elements in parallel computers, particularly multicomputers. The two networks have a similar structure. The toroidal mesh is popular and well-studied whereas the diagonal mesh is relatively new. In this paper, we show that the diagonal mesh has a smaller diameter and a larger bisection width. It also retains advantages such as a simple rectangular structure, wirability and scalability of the toroidal mesh network. An optimal self-routing algorithm is developed for these networks. Using this algorithm and the existing routing algorithm for the toroidal mesh, we simulated and compare the performance of these two networks with N = 35 x 71 = 2485, N = 49 x 99 = 4851, and N = 69 x 139 = 9591 nodes under a constant system with a fixed number of mesages. Deflection routing is used to resolve conflicts. The effects of various <b>deflection</b> <b>criteria</b> are also investigated. We show that the diagonal mesh outperforms the toroidal mesh in all cases, and thus provides an attractive alternative to the toroidal mesh network.

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the main}} {{requirements}} of cognitive radio systems {{is the ability to}} reliably detect the presence of licensed primary transmissions. Previous works on the problem of detection for cognitive radio have suggested the necessity of user cooperation {{in order to be able}} to detect at the really low signalto-noise ratios experienced in practical situations. We consider a system of cognitive radio users who cooperate with each other in trying to detect licensed transmissions. Assuming that the cooperating nodes use identical energy detectors, we model the received signals as correlated log-normal random variables and study the problem of fusing the decisions made by the individual nodes. We design a linear-quadratic (LQ) fusion strategy based on a <b>deflection</b> <b>criterion</b> for this problem, that takes into account the correlation between the nodes. Our simulation results show that the LQ detector significantly outperforms the counting rule, which is the fusion rule that is obtained by ignoring the correlation. primary TX guard band primary’s range range of secondary secondary TX Fig. 1.
