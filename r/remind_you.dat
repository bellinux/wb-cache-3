25|$|Somewhere in {{the middle}} Sixties, I first came upon the 56-page letter which Kelly {{attempted}} to have printed when the gang robbed the bank in Jerilderie in 1879. It is an extraordinary document, the passionate voice {{of a man who}} is writing to explain his life, save his life, his reputation … And all the time there is this original voice - uneducated but intelligent, funny and then angry, and with a line of Irish invective that would have made Paul Keating envious. His language came in a great, furious rush that could not but <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> of far more literary Irish writers.|$|E
25|$|The {{only means}} {{which have been}} placed in my power of 'raising the wages of colliers' has been by endeavouring to beat down all those {{restrictions}} upon trade which tend to reduce the price to be obtained for the product of their labour, & to lower as much as may be the taxes on the commodities which they may require for use or for consumption. Beyond this I look to the forethought not yet so widely diffused in this country as in Scotland, & in some foreign lands; & I need not <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that in order to facilitate its exercise the Government have been empowered by Legislation to become through the Dept. of the P.O. the receivers & guardians of savings.|$|E

25|$|Before {{releasing}} the jury for deliberation, Judge Learned Hand altered {{the charges against}} the defendants and attempted to preface the jury of their constitutional duties. Hand dismissed all the charges against Josephine Bell, and dismissed the first count – “conspiracy to cause mutiny and refusal of duty”—against the remaining defendants. Prior to {{releasing the}} jurors, Judge Hand stated, “I {{do not have to}} <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that every man has the right to have such economic, philosophic or religious opinions as seem to him best, whether they be socialist, anarchistic or atheistic.” After deliberating from Thursday afternoon to Saturday, the jury returned with two decisions. First, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the jurors seeking to convict the defendants blamed one juror for being unable to conform to the majority opinion, as he was also a socialist and, consequently, un-American. Not only did the other eleven jurors demand the prosecutor to levy charges against the lone juror) but moved to drag the socialist supporter out into the street and lynch him. Judge Hand, given the uproar, declared a mistrial.|$|E
25|$|You write: „in {{order to}} avoid {{unnecessary}} bloodshed“. Who {{is the cause of}} this bloodshed? We or you? Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands. We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall <b>remind</b> <b>you,</b> fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E

500|$|Childhood and {{adolescence}} are two important themes in Little Busters!. The opening {{video of the}} visual novel starts with two lines written in English: [...] "What 'Adolescence' do you have?" [...] and [...] "Do you remember 'Childhood'?". Riki Naoe, the male protagonist, has four childhood friends with whom he grew up together through adolescence and still hangs out with when the story begins. Thus, friendship is another theme presented {{in the form of}} Riki's relationships with his friends in high school, and is thought to be irreplaceable. The opening video of the original visual novel contains a third line written in English, [...] "The irreplaceable one existed there," [...] though another line was added into the opening video of Little Busters! Ecstasy: [...] "This will <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that you have to recollect 'Adolescence'." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{species is}} edible, but {{opinions}} about its palatibility are mixed: one author says the fruit bodies are [...] "coarse {{and do not}} taste good"; another mentions the [...] "thin flesh hardly make this species worthwhile;" [...] yet another says [...] "The yellow cap may <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> of chicken fat; it has a wonderfully savory mushroom flavor." [...] The slimy texture of the mushroom {{has been compared to}} okra. One cookbook author suggests that the mushroom is ideal for spreads, for use on bread or as a dip; baking the fruit bodies in an oven will dry them for future use, and concentrate the flavor. The odor and taste are mild; one field guide suggests it has a [...] "distinctive lemony tang". The slimy caps and the pore layer are typically removed before consumption.|$|E

Similarly, Rolling Stone Daniel Kreps said Jeff helps to [...] "bridge the gap between the Marlboro Man ... and a 'lung that looks like you're breathing through baked ziti'". Alicia Lu of Bustle wrote: Sure, he may be an anthropomorphic lung that's decaying from being exposed to years of cigarette smoke, which might not be Big Tobacco's first choice for branding, but he's a cowboy. Look at his regal cowboy hat, his spiffy red cowboy boots, and the way that cigarette nonchalantly dangles from his lips – doesn't Jeff <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> of a figure from days of yore? If you squint, I swear you'll see the Marlboro Man.|$|E
500|$|Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, noted the episode was: [...] "A stunningly outspoken {{political}} satire that drew considerable disapproval from the Republican Party when it was aired." [...] Eric Reinagel, Brian Moritz, and John Hill of the Press & Sun-Bulletin named [...] "Sideshow Bob Roberts" [...] as the seventh best episode of the series. Thomas Rozwadowski of Green Bay Press-Gazette placed the episode among his list of the ten best episodes of the show which have lessons: [...] "Corrupt politicians always get their comeuppance. Or not." [...] He also highlighted Bob's campaign advert and Kent Brockman's line: [...] "And the results are in. For Sideshow Bob, 100 percent. For Joe Quimby, 1 percent. And we <b>remind</b> <b>you,</b> there is a 1 percent margin of error." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{reference}} to the role that earned Irons an Academy Award, Claus von Bülow in Reversal of Fortune (1990), the writers gave Scar one of von Bülow's lines, [...] "You have no idea," [...] which is uttered by Irons in a similar tone. According to author Rachel Stein of New Perspectives on Environmental Justice: Gender, Sexuality, and Activism, Irons relies [...] "on his history of playing sexually perverse, socially dangerous male characters to animate his depiction of Scar." [...] On the contrary, Irons revealed to Connect Savannah that the similarities between the voices of Scar and von Bülow were largely unintentional, explaining, [...] "Whatever voice came was arrived at by looking at the initial sketches, and from the freedom the directors gave me to try anything." [...] Irons concluded, [...] "The fact that he may occasionally <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> of Claus, {{comes from the fact that}} they both share the same voice box." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle directed. Pinkner and Wyman approached the episode [...] "like a new pilot" [...] {{to draw in}} viewers who wanted to watch the show but did not know when to start. They used Lincoln Lee {{as a tool to}} acquaint viewers with the new changes. Former guest actor Seth Gabel, who played Lee, joined the cast as a series regular for the fourth season. He believed his character allowed the audience to see Fringe Division from a new perspective. He explained, [...] "You need a layman's perspective from time to time. The show has gotten so deep into this crazy, surreal scientific world that you need someone to enter every now and then to <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> this is not the common experience. You need someone to show you how far down the rabbit hole you’ve gone, so you don't become desensitized to it. I think Lincoln serves that for a while." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{technical}} aspects of the game were also praised. Although {{by the time of}} its release in late 1999, Planescape: Torment's default 640x480 resolution was not considered particularly advanced, reviewers were pleased with the art design and color of the environments. The game's sound and music were described as [...] "well above the norm" [...] and [...] "superb", and one reviewer stated that his only complaint about the music was that [...] "there wasn't enough of it". Another reviewer stated that Planescape: Torment had [...] "just about the best sound" [...] they had heard in a video game. GamePro stated, [...] "... the characters talk with the talent of real professional voice actors during crucial bits of dialog". The game's graphics were moderately well received, with incite PC Gaming saying that [...] " [...] can be a little lackluster, although some of the spell effects certainly look very good", a statement echoed in NextGen which stated that [...] "mind-blowing spell effects ... will <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> of a two-dimensional Final Fantasy game." ...|$|E

500|$|Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live! {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Kathryn Shattuck of The New York Times {{said that is}} difficult to recognize Lady Gaga [...] "out of her usual get-ups: the meat dresses, seashell bikinis, towering stilettos and skyscraper hair" [...] and praised Bennett's vocals [...] "his voice still strong at 88, take on the Great American Songbook and prove again that the classics can bridge many divides." [...] Soraya Nadia McDonald of The Washington Post wrote [...] "It's become practically cliché to note what an odd couple they make, so we'll just <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> they're actually both divine live performers and they've got great chemistry." [...] Jeff Pfeiffer from Channel Guide said that although Bennett and Gaga [...] "engage in some playfulness and camaraderie which is generally fun, though Lady Gaga may be trying too hard at times". He added that [...] "The artists and the terrific orchestra are in fine form, and though the editing between numbers seemed a bit rapid on occasion, the production and directing is effective to capture the performances".|$|E
500|$|Rap-Up {{stated that}} Beyoncé is {{dominant}} over men in [...] "Run the World". [...] "Run the World" [...] {{opens with a}} short piano solo and a heavy beat. Beyoncé chants, [...] "Girls! / We run this mutha / Girls! / Who run the world." [...] It moves into smoother, more persuasive but still boastful lyrics, [...] "I think I need a barber/ None of these ho's can fight me/ I'm so good with this/ I <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> I'm so 'hood with this." [...] She then delivers the repetitive hook and chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé sings that education gives women strength and independence. Other lyrics of this theme include the line, [...] "smart enough to make these millions, strong enough to bear the children, then get back to business." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News said that Beyoncé sings in her signature staccato style on the second verse of the song. She repeats the chorus after the bridge lines and her vocals fade out as the song finishes.|$|E

After that, she returns home and collapses into her bed. Scenes interspersed through the main plot of the visual display Lo staring at the camera while lip syncing the lyrics of the song. Miles Raymer of Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "clever" [...] video that [...] "showcases Lo's artfully complicated party-girl image as she recreates some of the debauchery in her lyrics, {{as well as some of}} its after-effects". Caitlin White of Noisey said that the [...] "new video for 'Habits' shows the darker side of coping with a lost love" [...] and that it [...] "may <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> of Janis Joplin a bit".
