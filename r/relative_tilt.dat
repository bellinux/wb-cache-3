An offset is found between {{the direction of the}} best aligned dust grains, and the upwind direction of the undeflected large interstellar grains seen by Ulysses and Galileo.

When the {{crystalline}} ab-plane is inclined {{from the sample}} surface, the surface-normal direction will be defined with contributions from both the crystallographic c-axis and the a- (or b-) axis even though the latter will have a minor contribution. Then the photocarriers generated at the surface, which otherwise are accelerated simply along the surface-normal direction, will experience an anisotropic electrostatic potential or anisotropic transport behavior as they travel inside of the film. Consequently, THz light emitted through a surge current can have the finite anisotropic response on the sample azimuth. Since x-ray diffraction results revealed the <b>relative</b> <b>tilting</b> angle between diffraction planes of the TI film and the substrate, crystallographic planes can be drawn differently as in Fig.  3 b where the crystal plane of the substrate is inclined {{with respect to the}} sample surface and the TI crystal plane is in parallel with the sample surface. We consider that the configuration in Fig.  3 a instead of that in Fig.  3 b is more preferable to explain the anisotropic THz emission results since the THz emission in the case of Fig.  3 b should appear isotopically as a function of Φ. Although the anisotropic THz responses in the variation of Φ were discussed in terms of the surge current THz emission process, {{it should be noted that}} the results would be explained also by the optical rectification process by considering the lowered surface symmetry.|$|R

We model the disc response analytically and we compare our results with three-dimensional SPH simulations. Inviscid as well as viscous hydrodynamics is considered. We show that in a viscous system the response derived from inviscid considerations is predominant even for the highest estimates of an anomalous disc shear viscosity. The angular momentum lost from the disc during the encounter is derived from linear theory, for distant fly-bys, as well as the changes to the disc orientation expected in non-coplanar encounters. It is shown that the target discs can become warped and precess by a small amount during non-coplanar encounters. This small precession is shown to give rise to a <b>relative</b> <b>tilt</b> of the disc which is always more important for determining its final orientation than is the change to the orbital inclination.

40|$|We {{propose a}} full-wave pseudo-analytical {{numerical}} electromagnetic (EM) algorithm to model subsurface induction sensors, traversing planar-layered geological formations of arbitrary EM material anisotropy and loss, which are used, for example, in {{the exploration of}} hydrocarbon reserves. Unlike past pseudo-analytical planar-layered modeling algorithms that impose parallelism between the formation's bed junctions however, our method involves judicious employment of Transformation Optics techniques to address challenges related to modeling relative slope (i. e., tilting) between said junctions (including arbitrary azimuth orientation of each junction). The algorithm exhibits this flexibility, both with respect to loss and anisotropy in the formation layers as well as junction tilting, via employing special planar slabs that coat each "flattened" (i. e., originally tilted) planar interface, locally redirecting the incident wave within the coating slabs to cause wave fronts {{to interact with the}} flattened interfaces as if they were still tilted with a specific, user-defined orientation. Moreover, since the coating layers are homogeneous rather than exhibiting continuous material variation, a minimal number of these layers must be inserted and hence reduces added simulation time and computational expense. As said coating layers are not reflectionless however, they do induce artificial field scattering that corrupts legitimate field signatures due to the (effective) interface tilting. Numerical results, for two half-spaces separated by a tilted interface, quantify error trends versus material and sensor characteristics.

A 10 x 10 mm polished surface of an unpoled crystal was mapped to form a composite image, indicating a fine structure of a- and c-domains. By making use of the angular separation of the diffracted reflections and specimen rocking, the <b>relative</b> <b>tilts</b> between adjacent domains about two orthogonal axes were found. Angular resolution better than 0. 1 mrad in tilt measurements allowed the local elastic curvature of lattice planes to be observed.

Over large regions of the crystal the domain structure was finer than the X-ray camera resolution of 6. 5 μm; AFM and SEM imaging of domains was then used to confirm the typical domain spacing.
