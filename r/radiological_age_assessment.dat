The present article addressesthis question through a number of steps. First, it questions whether the use of radiologicalimaging methods in the age assessment of unaccompanied adolescents seekingasylum complies with the internal norms of the forensic science community. Itdoes not. Secondly, the article considers whether the use of these methods is scientificallyauthoritative according to {{the current state of the}} art in forensic medicineand traumatology. It is not. Thirdly, the article asks whether their use sufficientlysafeguards against a particular kind of communicative error between decision makersand experts. It does not. The article shows that properly understood advice from amedical expert who takes into account the scientific issues enumerated in this articlecan never dispel doubt about an applicant’s age. According to article 25 (5) of theEuropean Union (EU) recast Asylum Procedures Directive, this prevailing doubt willautomatically trigger the assumption that the applicant is a child, which is the article’sfourth and final argument...|$|E
40|$|<b>Radiological</b> bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> {{is based}} on local image regions of {{interest}} (ROI), such as the epiphysis or the area of carpal bones. These are compared to a standardized reference and scores determining the skeletal maturity are calculated. For computer-aided diagnosis, automatic ROI extraction and analysis is done so far mainly by heuristic approaches. Due to high variations in the imaged biological material and differences in age, gender and ethnic origin, automatic analysis is difficult and frequently requires manual interactions. On the contrary, epiphyseal regions (eROIs) {{can be compared to}} previous cases with known age by content-based image retrieval (CBIR). This requires a sufficient number of cases with reliable positioning of the eROI centers. In this first approach to bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> by CBIR, we conduct leaving-oneout experiments on 1, 102 left hand radiographs and 15, 428 metacarpal and phalangeal eROIs from the USC hand atlas. The similarity of the eROIs is assessed by cross-correlation of 16 x 16 scaled eROIs. The effects of the number of eROIs, two age computation methods as well as the number of considered CBIR references are analyzed. The best results yield an error rate of 1. 16 years and a standard deviation of 0. 85 years. As the appearance of the hand varies naturally by up to two years, these results clearly demonstrate the applicability of the CBIR approach for bone age estimation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Radiological</b> bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> {{is based}} on global or local image regions of {{interest}} (ROI), such as epiphyseal regions or the area of carpal bones. Usually, these regions are compared to a standardized reference and a score determining the skeletal maturity is calculated. For computer-assisted diagnosis, automatic ROI extraction is done so far by heuristic approaches. In this work, we apply a high-level approach of scene analysis for knowledge-based ROI segmentation. Based {{on a set of}} 100 reference images from the IRMA database, a so called structural prototype (SP) is trained. In this graph-based structure, the 14 phalanges and 5 metacarpal bones are represented by nodes, with associated location, shape, as well as texture parameters modeled by Gaussians. Accordingly, the Gaussians describing the relative positions, relative orientation, and other relative parameters between two nodes are associated to the edges. Thereafter, segmentation of a hand radiograph is done in several steps: (i) a multi-scale region merging scheme is applied to extract visually prominent regions; (ii) a graph/sub-graph matching to the SP robustly identifies a subset of the 19 bones; (iii) the SP is registered to the current image for complete scene-reconstruction (iv) the epiphyseal regions are extracted from the reconstructed scene. The evaluation {{is based on}} 137 images of Caucasian males from the USC hand atlas. Overall, an error rate of 32 % is achieved, for the 6 middle distal and medial/distal epiphyses, 23 % of all extractions need adjustments. On average 9. 58 of the 14 epiphyseal regions were extracted successfully per image.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of bone age estimations performed by radiological and ultrasonic methods in children aged between 7 – 17 years. In the paediatric practice skeletal development estimation {{is a useful}} tool to examine the level of growth abnormality in the diagnosis and the {{analysis of}} the medical treatment effectiveness of children with constitutional delay of growth, growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism and other severe chronic illnesses that have significant influence on linear growth. Skeletal maturity of living children is commonly is assessed by using Greulich–Pyle (GP) and Tanner–Whitehouse methods (TW) in the clinical practice in the diagnostic radiography. However, an ultrasonic method was suggested to use in the epidemiological studies of skeletal maturity {{from the beginning of the}} 2000 s. The aim of the study were to analyse the skeletal maturity estimations of GP, TW 2 and TW 3 methods by a meta-analysis of former bone age studies and by a comparison of radiological bone estimates; as well as to analyse the accuracy of an ultrasonic method (based on the GP estimation) compared to the GP standard radiographic method. Bone age of healthy children (n: 1648, aged between 7 and 17 years) was estimated by a quantitative ultrasonic Sunlight BoneAge device. In addition, TW 2, TW 3 and GP bone ages were estimated from radiographs taken from the left wrist-hand region in a randomly selected subsample (n: 47) of subjects. Meta-analysis of <b>radiological</b> skeletal <b>age</b> <b>assessments</b> from the late 1950 s was done including the present study. The TW 2 and TW 3 skeletal age estimations differed from the chronological age of 11 years in the boys and from the beginning of studied age interval in the girls. The GP method showed very strong correlation with both the TW 3 RUS and TW 3 CA bone age estimations. The CA estimates had a significant decreasing tendency with GP estimates by chronological age in both genders due to the special pattern of carpal maturation. The ultrasonic bone age estimation is suggested to use between the chronological ages 8. 5 – 16 years in the boys and 7. 5 – 15 years in the girls. The very strong correlation of radiological and ultrasonic bone age estimates gives us the possibility to use the ultrasonic bone age estimation in epidemiological surveys to assess skeletal maturity in children without the use of ionizing radiation...|$|R

40|$|There are {{different}} ROI (region of interest) processing and feature extraction in a computer-assisted bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> (CABAA) system for {{various stages of}} skeletal development [1] and these methods are critical points for image analysis to get a fine BAA. The first object is studying and analyzing the ROI processing scheme in a CABAA system. In the previous studies, we proposed a bone age and feature cluster estimation method which applies only a few presentable features extracted from input hand radiographs [2]. After the automatic ROI feature clustering and extracting, one still needs to construct a precise and complete bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> system for features and data in different bone development stages. The aim is to develop an automatic bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> system to provide a higher performance and precision of bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment.</b> Following our previous studies and results, we propose a three year project to progress the study of bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> based on phalangeal features of hand radiographs. The first year study will be focused on methods to construct a bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> system of the early bone development stage. The principal characters of the early bone development stage are the geometric shapes, areas and relative distances, and so on, of epiphyses and metaphyses. These features can be chosen and extracted according to the feature clusters obtained by our previous studies of ROI image segmentation, feature extraction, and bone feature clustering of early bone development stage [3, 4, 5]. Then for hand images in the early stage, {{we are going to}} design a suitable fuzzy neural network (FNN) algorithm [6, 7, 8, 9] to assess bone ages according to these features. These results obtained by applying this FNN to our database will be compared with bone ages estimated by clinical doctors. Then this FNN algorithm will be modified and trained again and again [9, 10, 11, 12]. The second year project is focused on the feature analysis of ROI images in later stage of bone development. In the later stage, the principal characters of phalanges are the fusion degrees of epiphseal/metaphyseal regions. We will apply wavelet transform and singular value division (SVD) techniques to analyze these characters of fusion degrees. First, a region containing epiphysis and metaphysis is extracted from an ROI image to be a new ROI image. Then one-level wavelet transform is applied to this ROI image to get 4 one-level wavelet frequencies. The energy of each normalized frequency region is calculated and finally an estimation parameter λ is produced as a character value to analyze the texture and get the corresponding character based features in description of epiphyseal fusion. The object of the third year study is the construction and analysis of the bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> of the later stage. According to the results obtained in the second year study, one is going to analyze and extract the features of ROI images in the later stage. Features in the related feature cluster suggested from the results by previous bone-cluster estimation are applied to train a support vector machine (SVM). After training, one can get an SVM for bone <b>age</b> classification and <b>assessment</b> of ROI images in the later stage. Again, the assessment results of ROI images in our database will be compared with bone ages estimated by clinical doctors. The SVM algorithm will be modified and trained again and again. The final goal of our project is to construct a more reliable and flexible fully automatic bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> system. 在電腦化骨齡估測(CABAA: Computer-assisted Bone <b>Age</b> <b>Assessment)</b> 系統中，有關影像感興趣區域(ROI: Region Interest) 處理及特徵選取方法，會因每個階段骨骼發展特性的不同而存在極大的差異性[1]，且往往為最終預測骨齡的重要關鍵。因此，上述相關演算法的分析與研究自然是CABAA系統中的首要任務。在之前的研究中，我們提出了一個可利用少數具代表性的特徵對於待測之手掌影像進行前置的骨齡群集估測的方法[2]。在ROI特徵分類及萃取後，最後所需要的是針對不同時期的特徵及資料，建立正確、完善的骨齡估測系統。目的在於致力發展一套自動化骨齡估測系統，以提升骨齡評估之工作效率及準確性。我們將延續先前的研究計畫及成果，提出三年計劃，來進行以指骨特徵為主之手掌X光影像骨齡估測系統之研究。第一年計畫重點為建立骨骼發展前期(early stage) 之骨齡估測方法，因前期指骨骨骼發展主要特徵為骨骺及幹骺端之幾何形狀、面積及相對距離…等項目，此部分可依據我們先前對於前期骨骼發展之ROI影像切割、特徵萃取、骨齡群集估測以及各群集所建議的特徵項目等研究所得到結果[3, 4, 5]，對於骨骼發展前期之影像，設計適當之模糊類神經網路(FNN: Fuzzy Neural Network) 演算法[6, 7, 8, 9]進行骨齡估測，最後與臨床醫師之判讀進行交叉分析比較，反覆進行演算法的修正與精進[9, 10, 11, 12]。第二年計畫重點為後期骨骼發展階段的特徵分析，分析後期指骨骨骼發展主要特徵為骨骺與幹骺端融合區塊的融合程度，我們將使用小波轉換(wavelet transform) 及奇異值分解(SVD) 等技術進行骨骼融合特徵分析。首先從ROI影像中擷取出包含骨骺及幹骺區域作為新的ROI影像，然後以一階小波轉換於新的ROI影像取得四份一階小波頻帶，接著計算各頻帶之正規化區域能量並最後產生估測參數λ值作為特徵值進行紋理分析。第三年計畫為骨骼發展後期(later stage) 之骨齡估測系統之建立與分析，依據我們第二年對於後期骨骼發展之ROI影像進行特徵分析與萃取、以及先前得到骨齡群集估測結果與各群集所建議的特徵項目，利用支援向量機進行學習與分類，進而得到後期骨齡估測結果。同樣地，最後再與臨床醫師之判讀進行交叉分析比較，以進行演算法的修正與精進。最終目標為提供一個更具信賴度且彈性的自動化骨齡估測系統...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The main bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> {{methods are}} the Greulich-Pyle and Tanner-Whitehouse 2 methods, {{both of which}} involve left hand and wrist radiographs. Several other bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> methods have been developed, {{including}} ultrasonographic, computerized, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging methods. The ultrasonographic method appears unreliable in children with delayed and advanced bone age.

An automated method for determining bone age, named BoneXpert, has been validated for Caucasian children with growth disorders and children of various ethnic groups. Sex hormones are necessary for bone growth and maturation in children with a bone age corresponding to normal pubertal age, and estrogen is essential for growth plate closure. Bone age is an effective indicator for diagnosing and treating various diseases. A new method for adult height prediction based on bone age has been developed using BoneXpert, {{in addition to the}} commonly used Bayley-Pinneau and Tanner-Whitehouse mark II methods.

The first permanent mandibular molar and lower jaws from 70 contemporary cattle of known age and 170 archaeological molar sets from ten different Swedish archaeological sites were used. The following conclusions were drawn: • The number of incremental lines in the dental cementum varied between {{different parts of the}} tooth root as well as within one and the same individual. The results from contemporary cattle of known age showed a strong relationship between age and incremental lines in the cementum of the distal part of the mesial root (R 2 = 65. 5 %) and the known ages of the animals. • With the “best” model variation in age could be explained to 65. 5 % (R 2) by the number of incremental lines. Thus, the remaining age variation (approximately 35 %) could not be explained by these lines. Other factors than must thus be responsible. However, with the exception of calves born the present material did not reveal any such significant relationship. • The results from cattle of known age indicate that the method of assessing age on the basis of cemental incremental lines is more reliable than other methods such as tooth wear or tooth measurements. However, by combining counting incremental lines and one variable assessing tooth dimension (tooth height) a slightly stronger relationship could be obtained (R 2 = 74. 5 %). The results from <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> of the medieval and post-Reformation cattle emphasize the importance of supplementing any age estimation of archaeological assemblages based on dental indicators with characteristics for the particular assessment model. Furthermore, conclusions based on <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> with such models can not be drawn with any more detailed time scale than about 2 years leaving at best only 25 % (R 2) of factors influencing the dental indicator(s) utilized in the model unexplained. The accuracy of the <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> required by the particular historical context in which the archaeological remains are found should thus decide what level of accuracy should be chosen...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{validate}} dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a method to assess bone age in children. Methods: Paired dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans and X-rays of the left hand were performed in 95 children who attended the paediatric endocrinology outpatient clinic of University Hospital Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We compared bone <b>age</b> <b>assessments</b> by DXA scan with those performed by X-ray. Bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> was performed by two blinded observers according to the reference method of Greulich and Pyle. Intra-observer and interobserver reproducibility were investigated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and agreement was tested using Bland and Altman plots. Results: The intra-observer ICCs for both observers were 0. 997 and 0. 991 for X-ray and 0. 993 and 0. 987 for DXA assessments. The interobserver ICC was 0. 993 and 0. 991 for X-ray and DXA assessments, respectively. The mean difference between bone age assessed by X-ray and DXA was 0. 11 years. The limits of agreement ranged from 20. 82 to 1. 05 years, whichmeans that 95 % of all differences between themethods were covered by this range. Conclusions: Results of bone <b>age</b> <b>assessment</b> by DXA scan are similar to those obtained by X-ray. The DXA method seems to be an alternative for assessing bone age in a paediatric hospital-based population...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Although {{numerous}} studies have uti-lized elemental analysis techniques for age deter-mination in bony fishes, little work has been conducted utilizing t‘hese procedures to verify <b>age</b> <b>assessments</b> or temporal periodicity of growth band formation in elasmobranchs. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine the potential of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spec-trometry (LA-ICP-MS) to provide information on the seasonal deposition of elements in the verte-brae of the round stingray collected from Seal Beach, California. Spatially resolved time scans for elements across the round stingray vertebrae showed peaks in calcium intensity that aligned with and corresponded to the number of seasonal growth bands identified using standard light microscopy. Higher signals of calcium were asso-ciated with the wide opaque bands while lower signals of calcium corresponded to the narrow translucent bands. While a close alignment be-tween the numbers of calcium peaks and annual growth bands was observed in round stingray samples aged 5 years or younger, this relationship was less well defined in vertebral samples from round stingrays over 11 years old. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to utilize ICP-MS to verify <b>age</b> <b>assessments</b> and seasonal band formation in an elasmobranch. The results from this preliminary study indicate that LA-ICP-MS elemental analysis of the vertebral cartilage of the round stingray may have potential to independently verify optically derived <b>age</b> <b>assessments</b> and seasonal banding patterns in elasmobranch vertebrae...|$|R
40|$|The Proceedings can {{be viewed}} at: [URL] Session: Age EstimationAfter {{attending}} this presentation, attendees {{will be able to}} appreciate the importance of population reference standards in dental <b>age</b> <b>assessments.</b> This will be presented {{in the form of a}} research study that aimed to estimate the age of Chinese subjects using three different population-specific refence standards. This presentation will impact the forensic science community by demonstrating the need for developing population standards for accurate <b>age</b> <b>assessments.</b> Attendees will further learn how to conduct <b>age</b> <b>assessments</b> through developing population-specific refence standards,which is a unique method developed by Dental Age Research London Information Group (DARLInG). <b>Age</b> <b>assessment</b> has become an integral part of forensic medicine due to poor birth registration practices and the high number of asylum claims in major countries. Ethnic variation in physical maturity is an established phenomenon; hence accuracy of the estimated age frequently varies based on the reference data from which the original scores were obtained. To analyze the effect of ethnic specific standards, this study was designed to test the accuracy of age estimated from three different population standards. A total of 266 subjects constituting an equal number of males and females aged 2 to 21 years old, and of southern Chinese ethnicity were randomly chosen from patients of Prince Philip Dental Hospital, Hong Kong. Panoramic radiographs taken previously for clinical diagnostic purposes were scored according Demirjian's classification of dental development stages. The Dental Age (DA) was estimated by obtaining mean ages of dental development from three datasets: French-Canadian, United Kingdom (UK) Caucasian, and Hong Kong (HK) Chinese. Following this, the difference between Dental Age and Chronological Age (CA) was calculated for each method (CA-DA). The overall mean age difference using the French-Canadian dataset was - 0. 62 years for males and - 0. 36 years for females, and 0. 25 years for males and 0. 23 years for females using the UK Caucasian reference data. The HK Chinese data estimated age as close as - 0. 02 years for both males and females. Statistical significance was set at p< 0. 01 and the Pearson correlation analysis was conducted between the DA-CA values obtained from three datasets. Poor correlation was observed using the UK Caucasian (r= 0. 70) and the French-Canadian (r=- 0. 05) datasets; however, in contrast, high correlation was observed in the HK Chinese (r=- 0. 28) dataset that was statistically significant (p< 0. 01). It is concluded that the HK Chinese reference data accurately estimated the age of the HK samples; thus, emphasizing the need for population-specific data to ensure accurate <b>age</b> <b>assessments.</b> Dental <b>Age</b> (DA) was estimated by obtaining mean ages of denta...|$|R
