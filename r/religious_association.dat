5|$|In 1593 {{he married}} Catherine Leigh, {{daughter}} of Sir Thomas Leigh of Stoneleigh Abbey in Warwickshire. Catherine {{came from a}} wealthy Protestant family and brought with her a dowry of £2,000, but also a <b>religious</b> <b>association</b> that offered Robert some respite from the recusancy laws then in effect. From {{the death of his}} grandmother the following year he inherited a property at Chastleton, in Oxfordshire. The couple's first son William died in infancy, but their second son Robert survived, and was baptised at Chastleton's Protestant church on 11November 1595. When Catesby's father died in 1598, his estates at Ashby St Ledgers were left to his wife, while Catesby and his family remained at Chastleton. Catesby had seemed happy to remain a Church Papist but after his wife's death later that year he became radicalised, and reverted to a more fanatical Catholicism.|$|E
5000|$|Article 137 {{was about}} <b>religious</b> <b>associations.</b> Main points include the {{omission}} of {{recognition of a state}} church. <b>Religious</b> <b>associations</b> manage their own affairs within the limits of general law. Religious offices are given without the influence of the state. <b>Religious</b> <b>associations</b> are legal entities. <b>Religious</b> <b>associations</b> which are [...] "bodies of public law" [...] keep this status. Other <b>religious</b> <b>associations</b> can request the same rights, if they can show by their constituency and number of members that they are permanently established. Associations with the purpose of cultivating a world view have the same status as <b>religious</b> <b>associations.</b>|$|R
40|$|Once Poland regained {{independence}} after WWI, it {{retained the}} validity of legal provisions from {{the period of the}} partitions, which resulted in incongruous administrative systems. The principle of citizens’ obligatory membership of any of the recognized <b>religious</b> <b>associations</b> was also tacitly acknowledged. The law of interwar Poland distinguished between recognized <b>religious</b> <b>associations,</b> enjoying the status of legal entities acknowledged by the State, whose relations to the State, as well as organizational status, were stipulated by law, and unrecognized <b>religious</b> <b>associations,</b> enjoying the right to freely practice faith and rituals. At that time there was also an attempt to regulate legal relations between the State and the Evangelical Union Churches, the Evangelical Augsburg and Helvetian Church with superindenture in Stanis³awów, the Vilnius Evangelical Reformed Church (Vilnius Unity), and the Evangelical Reformed Church with the Consistory in Warsaw. However, for numerous reasons, no normative acts were passed. The fact that in the interwar period there were no laws to constitutionally regulate the legal relations of churches and <b>religious</b> <b>associations</b> recognized by the former partitioning states, hindered the proces of unifying of religious law in the Second Republic of Poland. This was further influenced by administrative practices and the antagonistic attitude of the Catholic Church to religious minorities. For their own purposes, administrative authorities divided the existing churches and <b>religious</b> <b>associations,</b> distinguishing <b>religious</b> <b>associations</b> recognized by law, unrecognized <b>religious</b> <b>associations</b> operating by virtue of the laws of former partitioning states, and <b>religious</b> <b>associations</b> not recognized by law, but tolerated by virtue of Articles 111 and 112 of the March Constitution. After WWII ended, three churches were recognized by virtue of an administrative decision, and state authorities decided to change the procedure for legal regulation of newly emerging churches and <b>religious</b> <b>associations</b> in a way different from that provided by the legislature of the Second Republic. The aim of these changes was to simplify the procedures related to the establishment of new churches and <b>religious</b> <b>associations.</b> The Decree on Associations attempted to encompass churches and <b>religious</b> <b>associations.</b> The matter was later resolved by the Decree of 5 August 1949 on the protection of free conscience and religion. Later on matters were handled by the Office for Religious Denominations. Since 1989 the register of churches and <b>religious</b> <b>associations</b> has been conducted by the Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration...|$|R
50|$|On 8 April 1929 the new Law on <b>Religious</b> <b>Associations</b> codified all {{previous}} religious legislation.

In 1930 the Yevsektsia was dissolved, and there was now no central Soviet-Jewish organization. Although the body had served to undermine Jewish religious life, its dissolution led to the disintegration of Jewish secular life as well; Jewish cultural and educational organizations gradually disappeared.|$|R
5|$|In Belgium, the {{religion}} was organized as an association without lucrative purpose (asbl) in 1922 {{and was immediately}} registered as organism of public utility on a request of the Department of Justice.

25|$|Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) is {{a liberal}} <b>religious</b> <b>association</b> of Unitarian Universalist congregations. It was formed in 1961 by the {{consolidation}} of the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America. Both of these predecessor organizations began as Christian denominations of the Unitarian and Universalist varieties respectively. However, modern Unitarian Universalists see themselves as a separate religion with its own beliefs and affinities. They define themselves as non-creedal, and draw wisdom from various religions and philosophies, including humanism, pantheism, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism, Islam, and Earth-centered spirituality. Thus, the UUA is a syncretistic religious group with liberal leanings.|$|E
25|$|Established Christianity in the United States was {{experiencing}} {{challenges in the}} second half of the nineteenth century, a result of rapid urbanization and industrialization, high rates of immigration, and the growing understanding of evolutionary theory which challenged traditional Christian accounts of history. Various new religious communities were established in different parts of the country, among them the Free <b>Religious</b> <b>Association,</b> New Thought, Christian Science, and Spiritualism. Theosophy would inherit the idea — then popular in the United States — that emphasized the idea of free will and the inevitability of progress, including on a spiritual level. It was also influenced by a growing knowledge about Asian religions in the United States.|$|E

500|$|In Belgium, a General Council was {{organized}} in 1911 by Antoine to manage all material issues. It is currently composed of nine members including a chairman, a treasurer and a secretary. The founction of the First Representative of the Father was abolished in 1971, {{and there are}} no internal regulations in the temples. In France, the movement is led by a <b>religious</b> <b>association</b> called [...] "Culte Antoiniste" [...] ("Antoinist Worship"). All the desservants are part of a College of Desservants which manage the material issues, and whose decisions are implemented by an Administrative Committee. Within the college, a Moral Secretary is elected and serves as legal representative of the religion. Locally, the desservants nominate auxiliaries among the dressed followers so that they perform reading during worship and/or serve as healers. A Council of Local Interior composed of seven members including desservants is used for issues related to the temple on which it depends. Women as well as men can be chosen as ministers, as Catherine promoted gender equality in the worship. In all cases, Antoine, although deceased, remains the leader of the religion, which led Debouxhtay to compare him to the Pope in the Catholic Church.|$|E
500|$|Simple and brief, {{services}} are {{performed in the}} temples, generally twice per day, and are composed of two forms of worship: [...] "The General Operation", which consists of the transmission of the fluid to the churchgoers, and [...] "The Reading" [...] of Antoine's writings. Members who performed the services wear an entirely black dress, as sign of an intense involvement in the religion; they are not paid. Temples are also the place of consultations of a healer by people who wish to obtain a request, frequently related to health. Antoinist celebrations include Christian holidays and other three days that commemorate the founding couple and {{the dedication of the}} first temple. Registered as organism of public utility in Belgium and as <b>religious</b> <b>association</b> in France, the religion is directed by a college composed of the most active members called desservants. It is financed by anonymous donations and do not ask for money from its followers. In France, the cult classification of Antoinism in the 1995 Parliamentary Report was criticized by the sociologists who studied the religious group, and many people involved in the anti-cults fight did not report cultic deviances.|$|E
