5|$|After their arrest, law {{enforcement}} officials investigated whether Adolf, Gartrell and Johnson were linked to vandalism shootings that targeted at least two federal buildings in Denver two weeks prior to their arrest. Windows were shot at the U.S. Custom House and the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Station in Denver's downtown Federal District. Authorities were also studying whether a bullet <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Hertz rental car shot on August 15 could have matched the guns seized from the men.|$|E
5|$|Anders Limpar was {{the main}} {{absentee}} for Arsenal, having sustained a knee injury, on duty for the Swedish national team. David O'Leary started {{in place of the}} injured Steve Bould; midfielder David Hillier was selected ahead of Michael Thomas in Limpar's place on the left wing. Tottenham defender Terry Fenwick, <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> double leg break, replaced Justin Edinburgh in the first eleven. Without Paul Gascoigne, injured in the FA Cup final, Tottenham employed a five-man midfield with Gary Lineker as the sole striker.|$|E
5|$|He signed seven {{players in}} {{preparation}} for the 2013–14 season, and further strengthened by signing striker François Zoko in September. However Stevenage never <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> poor start to the season, and despite a late run of six undefeated games ended the campaign in last-place and were therefore relegated into League Two, finishing eight points shy of safety. Westley responded by releasing nine players, whilst a further four were sold on.|$|E

At low altitude spin recovery may also be impossible before impacting terrain, making low and slow aircraft especially vulnerable to spin related accidents.|$|R

5|$|The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) {{reports that}} many species populations {{have not yet}} fully <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{large-scale}} shift in the oceanic ecosystem that affected the North Pacific during the late 1980s and early 1990s. This shift reduced populations of important species such as spiny lobster, seabirds and Hawaiian monk seals. Commercial fishing ended in 2011. The monument receives strict conservation protection, with exceptions for traditional Native Hawaiian uses and limited tourism.|$|E
5|$|The spiders {{were first}} {{collected}} in 2010 by Geo Graening, Neil Marchington, Ron Davis and Daniel Snyder, cave conservationists from the Western Cave Conservancy. They were described in 2012 by a research team consisting of arachnologists Charles Griswold, Tracy Audisio and Joel Ledford of the California Academy of Sciences. The male holotype was {{recovered from the}} M2 cave near Grants Pass, Oregon on July 29, 2010. The female holotype was <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> cave in Josephine County, Oregon on September 16, 2010.|$|E
5|$|After construction, Morris invited {{friends to}} visit, most notably Burne-Jones {{and his wife}} Georgiana, as well as Rossetti and his wife Lizzie Siddal. They aided him in {{painting}} murals on the furniture, walls, and ceilings, much of it based on Arthurian tales, the Trojan War, and Geoffrey Chaucer's stories, while he also designed floral embroideries for the rooms. They also spent much time playing tricks on each other, enjoying games like hide and seek, and singing while accompanied by the piano. Siddall stayed at the House during summer and autumn 1861 as she <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> traumatic miscarriage and an addiction to laudanum; she would die of an overdose in February 1862.|$|E

5|$|Banksia canei lacks a {{lignotuber}} {{and appears}} to regenerate from bushfire by seed, although its response to fire has been little studied. The follicles remain closed until burnt, although some do open spontaneously after five years or so. The fungus Banksiamyces toomansis, of the order Helotiales, infects older cones and seed, and hence seed older than about five years is often not viable. Plectronidium australiense is a species of anamorphic fungus that was <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dead branch of B. canei at Healesville Sanctuary and described in 1986.|$|E
5|$|By 2017, sauropod fossils {{had been}} <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> total of 32 localities within the Nemegt Formation, and {{possibly}} belong to either Opisthocoelicaudia or Nemegtosaurus. At least two finds from the Nemegt locality — a fragmentary tail (MPD 100/406) {{and a pair}} of claws – show features diagnostic for Opisthocoelicaudia and can be referred to the latter. Field crews led by Philip Currie attempted to relocate the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype quarry in 2006 and 2008, but became successful only in 2009 thanks to additional data provided by Gradziński. Although a prospection for additional bone material was not possible as the quarry had been filled by windblown sand, the quarry could be determined to fall within the lower portion of the Nemegt Formation.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Allen {{began the}} {{season on the}} {{practice}} squad while he <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> knee injury, but he replaced Doug Hocking as a starter in Week 3. By late August, the Lions were facing the return of several key import players, including Stewart Hill and Lee Johnson. To meet CFL import ratio requirements, which require each team to field {{a certain number of}} Canadian players, the Lions replaced Allen again with Hocking. Allen's season was hampered both by his early injury and import ratio troubles, limiting him to three games in which he recorded 13 tackles. While on the practice squad, the Calgary Stampeders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and Toronto Argonauts tried to recruit him, but he declined to leave the Lions.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to plants and animals, the early fossil {{record of the}} fungi is meager. Factors that likely contribute to the under-representation of fungal species among fossils include the nature of fungal fruiting bodies, which are soft, fleshy, and easily degradable tissues and the microscopic dimensions of most fungal structures, which therefore are not readily evident. Fungal fossils are difficult to distinguish from those of other microbes, and are most easily identified when they resemble extant fungi. Often <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> permineralized plant or animal host, these samples are typically studied by making thin-section preparations that can be examined with light microscopy or transmission electron microscopy. Researchers study compression fossils by dissolving the surrounding matrix with acid and then using light or scanning electron microscopy to examine surface details.|$|E
5|$|Liam Brady was {{struggling}} as Celtic manager in September 1992, but enjoyed a brief respite {{in the first}} round of the UEFA Cup. Celtic <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 2–0 first leg defeat away at Cologne in the UEFA Cup to win the return match in Glasgow 3–0, midfielder John Collins scoring the decisive third goal seven minutes from time. Celtic were drawn against another German side in the next round, Borussia Dortmund. In the first leg away in Dortmund, Celtic turned in a good performance; Paul McStay and John Collins constantly troubled the Dortmund defence. Celtic came close to scoring after hitting the crossbar, and were unlucky to lose 1–0. Gerry Creaney levelled the tie on aggregate with a first half goal in Glasgow. Dortmund, however, took control in the second half, scored twice and sent Celtic out 3–1 on aggregate.|$|E

In September 2011, Lin played a few {{games for the}} Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) club Dongguan Leopards at the ABA Club Championship in Guangzhou, China, where he was named the MVP of the tournament. Shanghai Sharks president and former NBA star Yao Ming also tried, unsuccessfully, to sign Lin for the upcoming CBA season; Lin explained that as someone still under contract with the Golden State Warriors, he could not play in the CBA as the league would only admit NBA free agents. A {{few days before the}} lockout was lifted on November 26, Lin had been close to signing with an undisclosed club in Italy.|$|E

Atletico were {{themselves}} managed by an Englishman, Ronnie Allen. In the first leg, City <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> two-goal deficit to secure a 3–3 draw. The home leg was a routine 3–0 win. Post-match reports alleged that a scuffle had taken place at half-time between Mike Doyle and José Ramón Betzuen, The referee spoke to both managers, but did not take any further action.|$|E

For Arsenal, Anders Limpar <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> calf injury; he escaped a fine from the Swedish Football Association for failing to attend the national team's match against West Germany on 10 October.
