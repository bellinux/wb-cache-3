5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding. The throat pleats extend from the mouth to the navel and allow the mouth to expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals they feed on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E

5|$|Like most arthropods, spiders lack {{balance and}} {{acceleration}} sensors and <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> eyes {{to tell them}} which way is up. Arthropods' proprioceptors, sensors that report the force exerted by muscles {{and the degree of}} bending in the body and joints, are well understood. On the other hand, little is known about what other internal sensors spiders or other arthropods may have.|$|E

5|$|Air {{breathing}} {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, must breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E

5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E
5|$|Laying {{takes place}} in September and October. A clutch {{of four or five}} white and {{slightly}} shiny eggs, measuring 30 x 24mm, is laid. The incubation period has been recorded as anywhere from 19 to 23 days, with the female performing this duty alone. Newly hatched chicks are covered with long white down, and are largely helpless (nidicolous). They leave the nest four to five weeks after hatching and join up with other young birds in flocks, though <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> parents for food for another fortnight after fledging.|$|E

5|$|Sea lions have color vision, {{though it}} {{is limited to the}} blue-green area of the color spectrum. This is likely an {{adaptation}} for living in marine coastal habitats. Sea lions have fairly acute underwater hearing, with a hearing range of 0.4–32 kHz. Sea lions <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> whiskers or vibrissae for touch and detection of vibrations underwater. Compared to the harbor seal, the California sea lion's vibrissae are smoother and less specialized and thus perform less when following hydrodynamic trails, although they still perform well.|$|E
5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Secure attachment is when children feel they can <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment is when the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment is when the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment is when {{there is a lack of}} attachment behavior.|$|E

5|$|Matings are {{generally}} observed between March and May, {{but the most}} likely time of conception is April. Most mating {{takes place in the}} territories and during the day. Females have control over the copulation process, and males may have to keep mating with the same females. Females usually give birth to one young each year. Gestation lasts around 27 weeks, and pregnant females give birth between late September and November. Late births into January are sometimes observed. The altricial newborns <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> mothers for warmth. For their first three weeks, young cling to their mothers when they go foraging. After this, the young remain in the roosts. By January, young are capable of sustained flight, and by February, March or April are fully weaned.|$|E
5|$|The account starts briskly; {{only four}} pages {{are devoted to}} Ralph's early life and a further {{fourteen}} to his voyage to the Pacific Ocean on board the Arrow. He and his two companions– 18-year-old Jack Martin and 13-year-old Peterkin Gay– are the sole survivors of the shipwreck. The narrative is in two parts. The first describes how the boys feed themselves, what they drink, the clothing and shelter they fashion, and how they cope with having to <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own resources. The {{second half of the}} novel is more action-packed, featuring conflicts with pirates, fighting between the native Polynesians, and the conversion efforts of Christian missionaries.|$|E
5|$|The non-reproductive castes of {{termites}} are wingless {{and rely}} exclusively on their six legs for locomotion. The alates fly {{only for a}} brief amount of time, so they also <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> legs. The appearance of the legs is similar in each caste, but the soldiers have larger and heavier legs. The structure of the legs is consistent with other insects: the parts of a leg include a coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and the tarsus. The number of tibial spurs on an individual's leg varies. Some species of termite have an arolium, located between the claws, which is present in species that climb on smooth surfaces but is absent in most termites.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
5|$|When swimming, baleen whales <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> {{flippers}} for locomotion in a wing-like manner {{similar to}} penguins and sea turtles. Flipper movement is continuous. While doing this, baleen whales use their tail fluke to propel themselves forward through vertical motion while using their flippers for steering, much like an otter. Some species leap out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Because of their great size, right whales are not flexible or agile like dolphins, and none can move their neck because of the fused cervical vertebrae; this sacrifices speed for stability in the water. The hind legs are enclosed inside the body, and {{are thought to be}} vestigial organs. However, a 2014 study suggests that the pelvic bone serves as support for whale genitalia.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> huge heads, {{as opposed}} to the rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E
