25|$|Vehicles {{using two}} freewheels. A freewheel, as {{used on a}} pedal bicycle for example, allows a <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> to rotate faster than the {{mechanism}} that drives it, allowing a cyclist to stop pedalling while going downhill. Some early automobiles had the engine driving two freewheels, one for each driving <b>road</b> <b>wheel.</b> When the vehicle turned, the engine would continue to drive the wheel {{on the inside of}} the curve, but the wheel on the outside was permitted to rotate faster by its freewheel. Thus, while turning, the vehicle had only one driving wheel. Driving in reverse is impossible as is engine braking due to the freewheels.|$|E
25|$|In a south-pointing chariot, {{according}} to the hypothesis, Shaft B was connected to one <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> and Shaft C was connected through a direction-reversing gear to the other <b>road</b> <b>wheel.</b> This made Shaft A rotate at a speed that was proportional {{to the difference between}} the rotation speeds of the two wheels. The pointing doll was connected (possibly through intermediate gears) to Shaft A. When the chariot moved in a straight line, the two wheels turned at equal speeds, and the doll did not rotate. When the chariot turned, the wheels rotated at different speeds (for the same reason as in an automobile), so the differential caused the doll to rotate, compensating for the turning of the chariot.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} {{consists of}} five sets of double <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> with torsion bar springs. The {{system does not}} have track return rollers. The forward and rearmost <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> are equipped with hydraulic shock absorbers. On some of the tanks lightweight openwork <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> were used.|$|R
50|$|The TR-85 tanks have a {{torsion bar}} suspension. The modernized version also has eight {{telescopic}} hydro-gas shock-absorbers {{to increase the}} overall speed. The running gear consists of six dual rubber-tyred <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> and four return rollers per side, with the idler wheel at the front and drive sprocket at the rear. The first two <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> have characteristic, prominent gaps {{between them and the}} rest of the <b>road</b> <b>wheels.</b> The tank has two bolt tracks with metal-rubber articulations. The M1 version has aluminum alloy <b>road</b> <b>wheels.</b> The braking system has been improved by replacing the old wet multi-disc brakes with dry multi-disc brakes and the old hydraulic system with a new servomechanism.|$|R
50|$|All <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> have ball-bearings.|$|R
25|$|During normal driving, ESC {{works in}} the {{background}} and continuously monitors steering and vehicle direction. It compares the driver's intended direction (determined through the measured steering wheel angle) to the vehicle's actual direction (determined through measured lateral acceleration, vehicle rotation (yaw), and individual <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> speeds).|$|E
25|$|If a third <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> was included, {{this type}} of south-pointing chariot could have worked quite {{accurately}} as a compass when used for short journeys under good conditions, but if used for long journeys {{it would have been}} subject to cumulative errors, like chariots using the differential mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The Type 62 light tank {{uses the}} torsion bar {{suspension}} {{which consists of}} five road wheels on each side with a prominent gap {{between the first and}} second <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> and an even space between second, third, fourth and fifth <b>road</b> <b>wheel.</b> The road wheels are smaller and lighter than those from the Type 59 main battle tank. The track is driven by a drive sprocket at the rear, with an idler at the front. There are no return rollers. In effort to reduce the overall weight of the tank the original 12150L 12-cylinder liquid-cooled diesel engine from Type 59 main battle tank was powered down from 523hp (390kW) to 430hp (321kW). This modified version of the 12150L engine weights considerably less and was designated 12150L-3. This new engine gave the Type 62 a maximum road speed of 60km/h, maximum cross country speed of 35km/h, maximum road operational range of 500km and power-to-weight ratio of 20.5hp/tonne (15.3kW/tonne). The tank can cross 0.8 m high vertical obstacles, 2.85 m trenches, 30° side slopes and ford 1.4 m deep water obstacles (5 m when equipped with a snorkel).|$|E
50|$|The chassis {{has four}} twin rubber-tyred <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> with {{individual}} torsion bar suspension, a rear drive sprocket with detachable sprocket rings (lantern-wheel gear) and an idler wheel on each side. The {{first and last}} <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> each have a hydraulic rotary shock absorber. The track is 12.33 m long, 580 mm wide and has 90 links; despite having four <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> instead of five the ground contact area of the track {{is the same as}} the T-54 (3.84 m). Track center distance is 2.64 m The vehicle has a ground pressure of 0.63 kg/cm2.|$|R

50|$|The {{torsion bar}} {{suspension}} consists of six evenly spaced large rubber-tired <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> with the drive sprocket {{at the rear}} and the idler at the front. The <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> are hollow to ensure additional amphibious abilities. Usage of hollow <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> increased APC's buoyancy by 30%. There are no track-return rollers. The first and last <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> have a hydraulic shock absorber and the steel tracks with a single pin have 96 chain links each when new. There is a small, thin, horizontal skirt over each track. OT-62 has the PV-6 6-cylinder, inline diesel engine developing 300 hp (224 kW) at 1,800 rpm. The engine gives it a road speed of 60 km/h with a cruising range of 450 km - 550 km. The vehicle can cross 0.9 m high vertical obstacles and 2.8 m wide trenches and climb 38° gradients.|$|R
25|$|In October 2017, Hanwha {{unveiled}} an internally-funded upgrade {{project that}} would turn the K200 into a modular, multi-purpose vehicle. The design involves stretching the chassis and adding a <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> for six pairs and removing the back section to create a flat cargo bed to fit various modules that can be swapped out for different missions; initial configurations include modules {{to act as an}} ambulance, fuel tanker, minelayer, and communications platform. With ROK Army approval, the company could fully mature the project in two years.|$|E
25|$|The Song Shi {{description}} of the gears in Yan Su's chariot, and the numbers of teeth on them, suggests that it worked this way, without a third <b>road</b> <b>wheel.</b> The gear ratios would have been correct if the pointing doll was attached directly to the large horizontal gear wheel, and the track-width of the chariot equalled {{the diameter of the}} road wheels. Wu Deren's chariot also appears to have been designed to work this way. The width of the chariot, and therefore presumably the track-width, was greater than the diameter of the wheels. The gear ratios were appropriate for these dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} {{does not}} mention a third <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> to fix the turning radius, {{but it is possible}} that such a wheel was present. No gears would have been attached to it, so perhaps the author of the description did not mention it because he did not realize that it was {{an important part of the}} mechanism. Putting such a wheel on the chariot and making it function properly would not have been difficult. It might have been attached to the pole to which the horses were harnessed. Stops would have been provided to limit the motions of the pole to left and right.|$|E
50|$|Note that {{tire size}} (or {{dimensions}} of the <b>road</b> <b>wheels)</b> {{does not affect the}} gear ratio of a vehicle, and thus using a different size tire on the same vehicle does not affect the torque on the <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> or the crawl ratio. However, for a given engine speed and a gear ratio, the output force on the <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> decreases as the tire size increases. A lower force in turn decreases the acceleration of rotating wheels. Therefore, the smallest tires that are still big enough to drive over obstacles perform better for a given crawl ratio.|$|R

25|$|To {{cope with}} the {{increased}} size and armor of the vehicle, a more powerful 400hp Detroit Diesel 6V53TIA turbocharged/aftercooled diesel engine is installed {{in place of the}} original 275hp engine on the M113, giving a power-to-weight ratio of 20hp/ton. This is coupled to an Allison X200 cross-drive, four-speed Hydrokinetic transmission. As a result of the longer chassis and improved engine a sixth <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> is added (the M113 only has five). As an option the vehicle can be of 350hp only. The modifications allows the EIFV to keep up in terms of speed and mobility with modern tanks such as the M1A1/A2 Abrams, which are used by the Egyptian Army, despite the added weight. The vehicle can travers slopes up to 80%, side slopes of 40%, trenches 2200mm wide, and vertical obstacles with a height of 710mm.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the ancient}} {{descriptions}} suggest that some south-pointing chariots could move in only three ways: straight ahead, or turning left or right with a fixed radius of curvature. A third wheel might {{have been used to}} fix the turning radius. If the chariot was turning, the pointing doll was connected by gears to one or other of the two main road wheels (e.g. whichever was {{on the outside of the}} curve around which the chariot was moving) so the doll rotated at a fixed speed, relative to the rate of the chariot's movement, to compensate for the predetermined rate of turn. The doll turned in opposite directions depending on which <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> was connected to it, so its rotation compensated for the chariot turning left or right. This design would have been simpler than using a differential gear.|$|E
25|$|The 4RM {{system used}} in the Ferrari FF in 2011 is unique in {{that it has a}} rear {{transaxle}} with secondary front transaxle connected directly to the engine. The car operates primarily as a rear wheel drive vehicle. Clutches in the front transaxle engage when the rear wheels slip. Drive to the front wheels is transmitted through two infinitely-variable clutch packs which are allowed to 'slip' to give the required <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> speeds. The front transaxle has three gears, two forward, and reverse. The two forward gears of the front transmission match the lower four forward gears of the rear transmission. It is not used in higher gears. The connection between this gearbox and each front wheel is via independent haldex-type clutches, without a differential. Due to the difference in ratios the clutches continually slip and only transmit, at most, 20% of the engine's torque.|$|E

50|$|The T-62 has {{a typical}} tank layout: driver's {{compartment}} at the front, fighting compartment {{in the center}} and engine compartment in the rear. The four-man crew consists of the commander, driver, gunner and loader. Although the T-62 is very similar to the T-55 and makes use of many of the same parts, there are some differences. These include the hull, which is a few centimeters longer and wider, the different <b>road</b> <b>wheels,</b> and differences in characteristic uneven gaps between <b>road</b> <b>wheels.</b> Unlike the T-54 and T-55 main battle tanks, the gaps between the last three pairs of <b>road</b> <b>wheels</b> are larger than the rest.|$|R
25|$|If in {{fact there}} was no third <b>road</b> <b>wheel,</b> the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so {{that one of the}} two wheels was {{stationary}} and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer could have kept the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A brake would have helped, but {{there is no mention of}} one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track-width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design would have worked as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would have been slow and awkward to turn. This might not have mattered if turns were rarely executed.|$|E
25|$|The floor {{selector}} lever {{also has an}} S position. When S is selected, sport mode is activated in the DSG. Sport mode still functions as a fully automatic mode, identical in operation to D mode, but upshifts and downshifts are made much higher up the engine rev-range. This aids a more sporty driving manner, by utilising considerably more of the available engine power, and also maximising engine braking. However, this mode does have a detrimental effect on the vehicle fuel consumption, when compared to D mode. This mode may not be ideal to use when wanting to drive in a sedate manner; nor when road conditions are very slippery, due to ice, snow or torrential rain — because loss of tire traction may be experienced (wheel spin during acceleration, and may also result in <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> locking during downshifts at high engine rpms under closed throttle). On 4motion or quattro-equipped vehicles this may be partially offset by the drivetrain maintaining full-time engagement of the rear differential in S mode, so power distribution under loss of front-wheel traction may be marginally improved.|$|E
25|$|In practice, this {{relationship}} {{can be observed}} in bicycles: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as sprockets) meshing with a circular chain, and a derailleur mechanism if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. multi-speed bicycle), all of which attached to the frame. A cyclist, the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby cranking the front sprocket (commonly referred to as chainring). The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of cadence (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on spindle of the bicycle's crankset. The bicycle's drivetrain transmits the input power to the <b>road</b> <b>wheel,</b> which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the gear ratio of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)input pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)output pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, angular speed of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.|$|E

25|$|The chariots of Yan Su and Wu Deren {{appear to}} have used this type of mechanism. (See {{descriptions}} quoted from the Song Shi, above.) Apart from the presence of components in Wu Deren's vehicle to make it function as an odometer, there were only minor differences between them. In each chariot, the two main road wheels were attached to vertical gear wheels. A large horizontal gear wheel was linked (possibly via intermediate gearing) to the pointing doll, and was positioned so a diameter almost spanned {{the space between the}} uppermost points of the vertical gear wheels. When the chariot was moving straight ahead, there was no connection between these gears, but when the chariot turned, a small gear wheel was lowered into contact with the horizontal gear and one of the vertical gears, thus linking the doll to one of the road wheels. Two small gear wheels were available, one to connect the horizontal gear to each of the vertical ones. Of course, they were not used simultaneously. The small gear wheels were raised and lowered by an arrangement of weights, pulleys and cords which were attached to the pole to which the horses that pulled the chariot were harnessed. When the horses moved to one side or the other, in order to turn the chariot, the pole moved and the cords lowered the appropriate small gear wheel into its working position. When the horses returned to walking straight ahead, the small gear wheel was raised out of contact with the main horizontal and vertical gears. Thus the system functioned automatically. The mirror-symmetry of the vertical gears being linked by the small gears to the horizontal gear at diametrically opposite points caused the horizontal gear to rotate in opposite directions depending on which <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> was linked to it, thus rotating the pointing doll in opposite directions when the chariot turned left and right.|$|E
500|$|The [...] Škoda T-11/0 four-cylinder, {{water-cooled}} engine produced [...] at 1,800rpm. Two {{fuel tanks}} were fitted, the main tank with {{a capacity of}} [...] was {{on the left side}} of the engine and the [...] auxiliary tank was on the other side. The engine could run on gasoline, an alcohol-gasoline mixture, and [...] "Dynalkohol" [...] (an alcohol-benzole mixture). It was mounted in the rear along with the six-speed transmission which drove rear-mounted drive sprockets. The suspension was derived from the Vickers 6-Ton tank; eight small pairs of road wheels on four bogies per side, each pair of bogies sprung by a single leaf spring, a front idler wheel, and four track return wheels. An unsprung <b>road</b> <b>wheel</b> was located directly underneath the idler wheel to improve obstacle crossing. The transmission, brakes and steering were mechanically assisted with compressed air, reducing driver fatigue. This last feature proved problematic in the extreme conditions of the Eastern Front.|$|E
