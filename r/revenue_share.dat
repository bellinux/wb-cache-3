The amount of advertising on the music channels amounts up to 4 minutes per hour, similar to the amount of advertising XM included before going commercial free.

40|$|The {{research}} problem for this dissertation {{was to determine}} the affects of President Nixon 2 ̆ 7 s New Federalism in four Pacific Northwest cities. More specifically, the dissertation sought to determine and explain the effects of the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, a basic component of the New Federalism, in Seattle, Tacoma, Portland and Eugene. The central goal of <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> and the New Federalism is to decentralize government in the American federal system. The central fear of those who oppose the effects of such decentralization is that the poor and minority groups of America may be discriminated against by local special interest groups. The purpose of the dissertation was to see {{the extent to which the}} goals of the proponents and the fears of the opponents have so far been realized in the <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> experience of four cities. A comparative case study approach was used whereby the General <b>Revenue</b> <b>Sharing</b> experience of each city was described and analyzed in terms of the goals of the New Federalism and the fears of its opponents. The data used for this investigation was obtained from taped interviews with city officials in each of the four cities. A questionnaire was prepared for the interviews which included questions pertaining to federalstate- city relations in terms of grants-in-aid, the fiscal condition of the city, the decision-making process used in the city for allocating <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> funds, who participated in the decision-making process, who benefitted from <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> in the city and the overall satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the concept of the New Federalism and <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing.</b> In addition to the data collected from city officials who were directly involved in the city <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> process, additional data was obtained from those interviewed showing how the <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> money was dealt with. It should be noted that these city officials were administrative personnel as well as elected officials. The results of the dissertation showed that the decentralization of American government sought by the Nixon Administration has so far not been obtained through General <b>Revenue</b> <b>Sharing</b> insofar as these four cities are concerned. The money from General <b>Revenue</b> <b>Sharing</b> was not adequate for these cities to meaningfully gain increased power and independence from either their states or the federal government. The fiscal requirements of these cities due to inflation, labor costs, demands to compensate for cutback categorical grants of the federal government and inadequate urban tax bases made the infusion of General <b>Revenue</b> <b>Sharing</b> money too small to allow the cities to undertake dramatic 2 ̆ 2 new 2 ̆ 2 departures because of these funds. Seattle and Eugene did undertake housing programs and Portland saw <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> funds as 2 ̆ 2 freeing up 2 ̆ 2 other monies so the city could undertake a new neighborhood participation program, but as a rule these cities found the demands from traditional city services plus the increased burden of having to fund cutback federal categorical grant programs as using up all their funds including <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing.</b> The dissertation laid particular emphasis on the question of whether local poor people and minorities were deliberately included in the decision-making processes over <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> and in the programs funded with <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> funds. It was found that Tacoma especially sought to develop a decision-making process that was inclusive of representatives from all segments of the city and that Seattle had perhaps the least inclusive decisionmaking process. But there was not a direct correlation between degree of citizen-wide participation and benefits from <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> going to all citizens equally. Although General <b>Revenue</b> <b>Sharing</b> is only one part of the New Federalism it appears that for the decentralization of American government to be meaningful, General <b>Revenue</b> <b>Sharing</b> will have to be dramatically increased in funding and supplemented with Special <b>Revenue</b> <b>Sharing</b> to take up the slack from cutback federal categorical grants intended for the human and community services areas. If the major goal of the New Federalism, decentralization, has not been accomplished so far, then the major fear of opponents has not been realized either. The dissertation demonstrates a commitment on the part of the City Council majorities in each city to preserve the progress made in recent years to improve the lot of America 2 ̆ 7 s poor and minority citizens. These groups, while sometimes having not been greatly involved in the <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> decision-making processes, were recognized as deserving a part of the <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> funds.

40|$|Under a {{revenue-sharing}} contract, {{a retailer}} pays a supplier a wholesale price for each unit purchased, plus {{a percentage of}} the revenue the retailer generates. Such contracts have become more prevalent in the videocassette rental industry relative to the more conventional wholesale price contract. This paper studies revenue-sharing contracts in a general supply chain model with revenues determined by each retailer 2 ̆ 7 s purchase quantity and price. Demand can be deterministic or stochastic and revenue is generated either from rentals or outright sales. Our model includes the case of a supplier selling to a classical fixed-price newsvendor or a price-setting newsvendor. We demonstrate that <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> coordinates a supply chain with a single retailer (i. e., the retailer chooses optimal price and quantity) and arbitrarily allocates the supply chain 2 ̆ 7 s profit. We compare <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> to a number of other supply chain contracts (e. g., buy-back contracts, price-discount contracts, quantity-flexibility contracts, sales-rebate contracts, franchise contracts, and quantity discounts). We find that <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> is equivalent to buybacks in the newsvendor case and equivalent to price discounts in the price-setting newsvendor case. <b>Revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> also coordinates a supply chain with retailers competing in quantities, e. g., Cournot competitors or competing newsvendors with fixed prices. Despite its numerous merits, we identify several limitations of <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> to (at least partially) explain why it is not prevalent in all industries. In particular, we characterize cases in which <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> provides only a small improvement over the administratively cheaper wholesale price contract.
