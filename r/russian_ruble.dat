5|$|The {{economy of}} Belarus {{has been in}} a state of flux since Lukashenko's {{election}} in 1994. His economic policies aimed to prevent issues that occurred in other former Soviet states, such as the establishment of oligarchic structures and mass unemployment. The unemployment rate for the country at the end of 2011 was at 0.6% of the population (of 6.86million eligible workers), a decrease from 1995, when unemployment was 2.9% with a working-eligible population of 5.24million. The per-capita Gross national income rose from US$1,423 in 1993 to US$5,830 at the end of 2011. One major economic issue Lukashenko faced throughout his presidency was the value of the Belarusian ruble. For a time it was pegged to major foreign currencies, such as the euro, US dollar and the <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> {{in order to maintain the}} stability of the Belarusian ruble. Yet, the currency has experienced free fall and also several rounds of devaluation. A major devaluation took place in 2011 after the government announced that average salaries would increase to US$500. The 2011 devaluation was the largest on record for the past twenty years according to the World Bank. Belarus also had to seek a bailout from international sources, and while it has received loans from China, receiving loans from the IMF and other agencies depend on how Belarus reforms its economy according to standards set by the IMF and other agencies.|$|E
25|$|Like {{a number}} of other republics of the former Soviet Union, Tajikistan {{continued}} using the Soviet/Russian rouble a few years after independence. On July 26, 1993, a new series of <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> was issued and old Soviet/Russian rubles ceased to be legal tender in Russia. In Tajikistan, pre-1993 Russian rubles ceased to be legal tender on 8 January 1994. On May 10, 1995, the Tajikistani ruble replaced the <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> at a rate of 1 Tajikistani ruble to 100 Russian rubles.|$|E

25|$|Like {{other republics}} of the former Soviet Union, Uzbekistan {{continued}} using the Soviet/Russian ruble after independence. On July 26, 1993, {{a new series of}} <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> was issued and the old Soviet/Russian ruble ceased to be legal tender in Russia. Some successor states had their national currencies before the change, some chose to continue using the pre-1993 Soviet/Russian ruble, and some chose to use both the pre-1993 and the new <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble.</b> Tables of modern monetary history: Asia implies that both old and new rubles were used in Uzbekistan.|$|E

25|$|Before 1878 {{the silver}} <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> was valued so highly as {{to drive the}} native coins out of circulation. Consequently, in 1889, Romania {{unilaterally}} joined the Latin Monetary Union and adopted a gold standard. Silver coins were legal tender only up to 50 lei. All taxes and customs dues were to be paid in gold and, owing to the small quantities issued from the Romanian mint, foreign gold coins were current, especially French 20-franc pieces (equal at par to 20 lei), Turkish gold lire (22.70), old Russian imperials (20.60) and British sovereigns (25.22).|$|E
25|$|Sporadic acts of {{violence}} continued throughout the postwar years. Despite the peacekeeping status of the Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia, Georgian officials routinely claimed that Russian peacekeepers were inciting violence by supplying Abkhaz rebels with arms and financial support. Russian support of Abkhazia became pronounced when the <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> became the de facto currency and Russia began issuing passports to the population of Abkhazia. Georgia has also accused Russia of violating its airspace by sending helicopters to attack Georgian-controlled towns in the Kodori Gorge. In April 2008, a Russian MiG – prohibited from Georgian airspace, including Abkhazia – shot down a Georgian UAV.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Mercer Human Resources Consulting named Moscow the world's most {{expensive}} city for expatriate employees, ahead of perennial winner Tokyo, {{due to the}} stable <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> as well as increasing housing prices within the city. Moscow also ranked first in the 2007 edition and 2008 edition of the survey. However, Tokyo has overtaken Moscow as the {{most expensive}} city in the world, placing Moscow at third behind Osaka in second place. Critics of their methodology argue that this survey replicates the lifestyle that a senior executive would have in Washington DC, counting certain very expensive brand name foreign goods, but disregarding the many lines that are far cheaper in Russia, e.g. household staff, drivers, nannies, etc.|$|E

25|$|Russia {{remains the}} largest and most {{important}} partner for Belarus both in the political and economic fields. After protracted disputes and setbacks, the two countries' customs duties were unified in March 2001 but the customs controls were soon restored. In terms of trade, almost half of Belarusian export goes to Russia. Due to the structure of Belarusian industry, Belarus relies heavily on Russia both for export markets and for the supply of raw materials and components. After initial negotiation with the Russian Central Bank on monetary union, the <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> was set to be introduced in Belarus in 2004, but this was postponed first until 2005, then until 2006, and now seems to have been suspended indefinitely.|$|E

The agreement stipulates the conditions of issuing multiple-entry visas to citizens of Russia who are of certain occupations and regulated visa fees. Single-entry visas are US$50, while double-entry and multiple-entry visas are capped at US$100 and US$150. The agreement also stated that visa fees are to be paid in the national currencies of both countries, and due to the devaluation of the <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> in 2014 and 2015, Chinese missions in Russia increased the visa fees in ruble by 120 percent on 8 July 2016 in order to reflect the most recent conversion rate to U.S. dollar.|$|E
25|$|By 1917 {{the company}} share capital reached 6,000,000 marks. Due to the {{favourable}} workload, Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works could pay high dividend to its owners. The good order backlog also created problems and risks. After 1915 raw material availability became worse {{and the prices}} increased due to the war. The situation worsened in 1917, when strikes, rioting and general disorder increased in many Finnish cities. The workers in Finland demanded working day {{to be limited to}} eight hours; when unruly and armed Russian soldiers joined to support the Finnish workers in April, the employers' association agreed the demands. This calmed down the environment for the summer, but new troubles followed in the autumn. The atmosphere became restless and the company managers were threatened. The Russian Provisional Government was overthrown in the October Revolution and in middle of November a general strike emerged in Finland. Although the strike lasted only for some days, workload was reduced because the Russian military did not place new orders in the chaotic situation and also getting the payment for the ongoing repairs became uncertain. Also the high inflation of the <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> ate the viability.|$|E

500|$|Until 1 July 2016, the {{currency}} of Belarus was the Belarusian ruble (BYR). The currency was introduced in May 1992, replacing the Soviet ruble. The first coins of the Republic of Belarus were issued on 27 December 1996. The ruble was reintroduced with new values in 2000 {{and has been in}} use ever since. As part of the Union of Russia and Belarus, both states have discussed using a single currency along the same lines as the Euro. This led to a proposal that the Belarusian ruble be discontinued in favor of the <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> (RUB), starting as early as [...] 2008. The National Bank of Belarus abandoned pegging the Belarusian ruble to the <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> in August 2007.|$|E
2500|$|The markka was {{introduced}} in 1860 by the Bank of Finland, replacing the <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> {{at a rate of}} four markkaa to one ruble. In 1865 the markka was separated from the <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble</b> and tied to the value of silver. From 1878 to 1915, Finland adopted the gold standard of the Latin Monetary Union. [...] Up to World War 1, the value of the markka fluctuated within +23%/−16% of its initial value, but with no trend. However, the markka suffered heavy inflation (91%) during 1914–18. Gaining independence in 1917, Finland returned to the gold standard from 1926 to 1931. Prices remained stable until 1940. but the markka suffered heavy inflation (17% annually on average) during the war years and then up to 1926, and again in 1956–57 (11%). In 1963 the markka was replaced by the new markka, equivalent to 100 old markkaa.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union attempts were made to maintain a common currency (the <b>Russian</b> <b>ruble)</b> among CIS states. Armenia joined this rublezone. However it soon became clear that maintaining a currency union in the unstable political and economical circumstances of the post-Soviet states would be very difficult. The rublezone effectively collapsed with the unilateral monetary reform in Russia, 1993. [...] As result the states that were still participating (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Moldova, Armenia and Georgia) were 'pushed out' and forced to introduce separate currencies.|$|E
