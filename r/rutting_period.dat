During a {{two year}} {{preliminary}} study, the spatial organization {{of a group}} of males of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex ibex) was examined in the Gran Paradiso National Park, Western Italian Alps. An-nual, seasonal, and rut home ranges were deter-mined as well as altitudinal migration {{of a group of}} radio-collared adult Alpine ibexes from December 1995 to January 1998. The small annual home range size showed a traditional use of space, confirmed also by the high overlapping values between home ranges of consecutive years: the ibexes returned to the same places from year to year. For the <b>rut</b> <b>period</b> home ranges we obtained lower overlapping values. Rut home ranges size changed from winter to winter, depending on the snow cover which limited the movements of the ibex. Winter and spring home ranges were smaller than summer and autumn ones.

50|$|Argali reach {{breeding}} maturity at two {{to three}} years of age. Rutting may occur from October to mid-January, generally lasting longer in lower elevations. In rutting herds, both rams and ewes attack others of their own sex, exerting dominance by ramming each other with their horns. Although such groups engage in lamb-like play, the combat of a pair of mature males is a serious business. The rams slam into each other, with their fore legs up in the air, exerting enough force to be heard up to 800 m away. Often, the older males (over six years of age), which are also often the largest, end up the dominant ones and younger males are chased off once the ewes are in estrus. Once dominance is established, the top rams begin approaching ewes and smell their urine to determine their receptiveness. The ram then repeatedly approaches the ewe and forceably mounts her. Mating commences around {{two to three}} weeks after the rutting begins. Rams may remain in the company of ewes for up to two months after the <b>rutting</b> <b>period</b> is complete.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effectiveness of leuprolide, a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist, in suppressing rut-associated events in farmed male red deer. In mid-January (6 weeks before the <b>rut</b> <b>period</b> in the southern hemisphere) adult red deer (Cervus elaphus scoticus) stags that had been allocated to three groups (n = 10 per group) received leuprolide, administered subcutaneously in a 90 -day release formulation, at zero (control), low (22. 5 mg) or high (45 mg) doses. Following treatment with leuprolide there was evidence of suppression of mean plasma luteinising hormone concentration that was significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) at 9 weeks. Mean plasma testosterone concentration of all three groups rose following treatment, then declined prematurely in the low- and high-dose leuprolide-treated groups, {{so that it was}} significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) suppressed (0. 66 ± 0. 29 and 2. 0 ± 0. 88 ng mL– 1, low and high dose respectively) in early April when the peak value (9. 0 ± 1. 94 ng mL– 1) was recorded from control stags. A reduction in mean liveweight occurred in all three groups through February–April and this did not differ among treatments. However, a corresponding reduction in mean body condition score was greater in the control stags (P 3 ̆c 0. 05).

We investigated differences in activity patterns {{in relation to}} season, time of day, and age-sex classes of goats, and their possible causes. Since the goats spent the night sleeping (or resting) in caves or other sheltered sites, only diurnal activity budgets were considered. Activity patterns were very similar between the two study periods (from May to November). All age-sex classes of feral goats {{spent most of the}} daytime feeding in both years, especially during autumn and winter. Feral goats increased the percentage of daytime that they spent feeding and decreased their resting time from summer to autumn-winter in response to the decrease in available day length and, possibly, the decrease in forage quality and biomass. Feral goats on Rum had two or three daily peaks of feeding in summer, but showed no obvious daily feeding peaks in winter, although their percentage of feeding time remained relatively high throughout the daytime in winter. No significant differences in general activity budgets between adult males and females were found, but yearlings were found to spend more time feeding than adults and kids. Adult males spent more time in social activities than did other age-sex classes, and adult males sharply decreased the percentage of daytime that they spent feeding during <b>rutting</b> <b>periods,</b> which may have contributed to their higher mortality over the subsequent autumn and winter...|$|R

40|$|Vocal {{signatures}} {{and individual}} recognition are documented {{in a wide}} range of avian and mammalian species, but little is known about cervids. However, the existence of individual characteristics in cervid vocalizations is highly probable, as the individual morphology of their vocal organ determines the spectral structure of the uttered signal. Here, we report the presence of individual characteristics in the spectral structure of fallow deer groans recorded during the <b>rutting</b> <b>period.</b> We digitized 147 vocalizations from four adult males and transformed each of them into a power spectrum of 32 values in order to represent the frequency distribution of the sound power. A neural network discrimination with cross validation performed on the resulting variables allowed us correctly to identify 87. 9 % of the tested vocalizations. The spectrum characteristics of an individual remained stable over the <b>rutting</b> <b>period,</b> and probably over several consecutive ruts (the vocalizations of one male recorded during a previous <b>rutting</b> <b>period</b> were also correctly classi®ed).

Grazing bout length varied greatly from 1 min to 460 min with mean duration being 103. 1 ± 15. 0 (SD) min. Adult {{males and females}} differed marginally significantly in feeding bout length with females having relatively longer feeding bouts (P= 0. 077). The average bite rate for feral goats was 46. 3 ± 0. 6 bites/min with significant variations between sexes (P= 0. 023) and among months (P < 0. 001). Adult males had faster bite rates during pre- (June-July) and post-rutting (October-November) periods than during <b>rutting</b> <b>period</b> (August-September) (P < 0. 008), but the bite rate of adult females during pre-rutting period was not different from that during <b>rutting</b> <b>period</b> (P= 0. 327).

40|$|The tule elk (Cervus elaphus nannodes) was reintroduced to Point Reyes National Seashore, California in 1978. After exhibiting irruptive {{growth for}} 20 years, elk abundances have fluctuated. Three subpopulations of elk {{currently}} inhabit Pt. Reyes: a fenced subpopulation at high density; a free-ranging subpopulation in designated wilderness at low density; and a free-ranging subpopulation on active ranchland at low density. Little {{is known about}} the spatial ecology and population dynamics of tule elk. This unusual situation provided an opportunity to quantify and compare factors affecting the home ranges, group sizes, resource selection, small-scale movements and population dynamics of tule elk. I collected biweekly fixes on radio-collared elk cows between 2005 and 2008 to examine herd structures, space use patterns, grouping behavior and survival rates of tule elk. Radio-telemetry data revealed 6 herds of elk at Pt. Reyes (4 at Tomales), which had distinct herd ranges and showed little spatial interaction. Fixed kernel home ranges were some of the smallest for elk in North America (217 ha, SE = 35), and were negatively correlated with elk density. Home range sizes were 300 % smaller than previous estimated for elk at Pt. Reyes in 1998. The sizes of elk groups peaked during the winter and mid-summer, and were smallest during the spring parturition and fall <b>rutting</b> <b>periods.</b> Elk with larger home range sizes generally formed smaller groups. Resource selection function (RSF) results indicated that tule elk at Pt. Reyes selected flat, grassland-dominated habitats over hilly, scrub and forest habitats; although resource selection patterns varied among herds. Elk shifted to lower elevations, steeper slopes and more scrub-dominated habitats during the dry season (May - October). Most elk showed an aversion to areas close to roads and trails, but this result was not consistent across all herds. I quantified small-scale movement patterns of tule elk using hourly fixes from GPS-collared elk. Elk exhibited daily cycles in their movement patterns by increased their hourly movements in the morning and evening hours. Elk daily movements were longest during wet spring months and shortest during the dry fall months. Elk slowed when traveling through homogeneous grassland habitat. Windy conditions caused elk to slow, but precipitation had no effect on elk movement. Elk moved faster when closer to roads and trails. Elk in higher density herds moved slower on an hourly scale than lower density herds, but herd density had no affect on daily movement patterns. Using known-fate models applied to radio-telemetry data, I estimated annual cow elk survival was 0. 96 (SE = 0. 02). I captured and monitored radio-collared elk calves from 2005 to 2007 to estimate calf survival and causes of mortality. Using known-fate models, I estimated annual survival for elk calves was 0. 81 (SE = 0. 02). The primary cause of death for both cows and calves was starvation, which was often accompanied by copper and selenium deficiencies. Sensitivity and elasticity estimates of elk vital rates revealed that adult cow elk survival contributed the most (30 %) to elk annual population change (&# 955;). The D Ranch and Limantour herds were expected irruptive growth and by 2018 increase to 393 and 389 elk, respectively, based on stochastic population projection models. The projected future abundance of elk in the Tomales herds was dependant on the previous year's annual rainfall: models projected increases in elk abundance following years of above-average rainfall but no change in elk abundance following years of below-average rainfall. Future growth of the D Ranch and Limantour elk herds will likely concentrate on adjacent ranchlands, given RSF models results, and will likely result in future conflicts between NPS management, unless proactive actions are taken...|$|R

Simultaneous analysis of all characters showed that Cervidae form a monophyletic group made up of two lineages: plesiometacarpalians or Cervinae (Muntiacus (Dama, Cervus)), and telemetacarpalian cervids including Hydropotinae and Capreolinae (Hydropotes (Capreolus (Alces (Odocoileus, Rangifer)))). Moschidae appear as the sister group of Cervidae, and Bovidae seem more closely related to Cervoidea than are Giraffidae. An Eurasiatic origin for Cervidae is suggested.

40|$|Radiotracking of two {{roe deer}} Capreolus capreolus (1 female, 1 male) in a Mediterranean habitat (Matorrals) with a {{detailed}} analysis of the vegetation showed that within their annual home range the deers selected particular habitat types, according to the season. The northern slope was preferred by both animals. Comparatively to female, male had a larger annual home range (150 ha vs. 130 ha), composed of more widely scattered sites of preferred use in more seasonal vs variable habitat types. Habitat selection in different seasons was affected by several factors: i) in all seasons, abundance of Rubus ulmifolius and Rosa ssp., ii) strong winds, especially in winter, that caused the male to move to southern slope, iii) disturbance by hunting dogs in autumn that forced deers into one or two refuge zones, iv) aspect of deer biology, such as territory marking by the male and giving birth by the female, which modified not only behaviour but also use of space. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that, during the <b>rutting</b> <b>period,</b> female roe deer may undertake short excursions, outside of their normal home range, possibly to mate with a reproductive partner. To address this question, we analysed the ranging behaviour of 27 female roe deer Capreolus capreolus, equipped with GPS collars, inhabiting a fragmented landscape in France. We compared female movements during the <b>rutting</b> <b>period</b> with a non-rutting period over two summers using a recently published approach. Search intensity and home range size were significantly greater during the <b>rutting</b> <b>period.</b> The difference in home range size between the two periods was significantly greater in 2006 compared to 2005 and in open compared to closed habitat. We were not able to identify any influence of body mass on the difference in ranging behaviour between the two periods. Visual analysis of movement trajectories for 11 females revealed that 5 (45 %) performed an excursion for a duration of a few hours to several days. We speculatively suggest that female rut excursions provide an opportunity for active mate choice in roe deer, where males are territorial, although we cannot rule out the alternative explanation that these movements are a means to avoid male harassment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract GPS {{telemetry}} is {{a method}} with good accuracy to determine animal movements in the terrain. It is necessary to determine locations of free-ranging animals {{in order to understand}} movement patterns and habitat use, and to understand the consequences of human impacts like highways. This study aims to describe moose movement patterns and to evaluate the effect of highway traffic intensity on moose movements across a highway. Moose in Southwestern Sweden have different movement rates throughout the year. Increased movement rate for females was observed during spring and summer. The breeding season (15 September - 15 October) is the most important season for bulls. Our result shows that bulls significantly increase their movement rate during the rut, compared to other times during the fall. Movement rate increased twice compared with female movement rate during this period. No difference was observed during the <b>rutting</b> <b>period</b> for females (15 September- 15 October) compared with no <b>rutting</b> <b>period</b> during fall. During winter time, both sexes retain low movements, mainly caused by energy saving actions. A distinct crepuscular rhythm was exhibited during the summer and fall season, movements were more intense during dawn and dusk hours. No distinct crepuscular rhythm was noticed during winter and spring seasons. The traffic intensity at highway E 6 in Southwestern Sweden increases during the morning hours and reaches its maximum during midday. Moose in southwestern Sweden crossed highway E 6 more often at night time than day time. Thus highway crossings by moose occurred at times of peak moose movements, and traffic volume had lower importance...|$|E
5000|$|According to SARA, {{in their}} latest {{compilation}} on woodland caribou, [...] "The <b>rut,</b> or mating <b>period,</b> for caribou usually occurs in late September {{and the first}} half of October. Caribou cows begin breeding as early as 16 months of age; most breed annually by the time they are 28 months old, typically giving birth to a single calf the following spring (mid-May to mid-June). The males may theoretically breed at 18 to 20 months of age, but most probably have no opportunity before their third or fourth year. During the rut, males engage in frequent and furious sparring battles with their antlers. Large males with large antlers do most of the mating. To calve, females travel to isolated, relatively predator-free areas such as islands in lakes, peatlands, lakeshores, or tundra. Group size is lowest during calving and in summer; it increases before the rut and may decline or increase over the winter. Group size at all seasons is larger for forest-tundra caribou than forest-dwelling caribou. Survival rates for calves average between 30% and 50%, but can vary from almost none to 100%. Many factors interact to determine calf survival, including quality and quantity of forage (for pregnant females and {{in the first year of}} life), number of predators, and weather. The potential for very high survival means that it is possible for local populations to increase rapidly when conditions are favourable. SARA 2014 ...|$|R
40|$|Life {{histories}} {{theory suggests}} that organisms make trade-offs in energy allocation between their different functions, such as maintenance, reproduction and immunity. This theory {{is based on the}} assumption that energy is limited and therefore an increase in investment in one function will necessarily result in a decrease in another one. The main objective of this thesis was to study the mating strategy of male bighorn sheep to see if rams have to trade between current reproduction and other functions such as parasitism and survival. To achieve this, I monitored the individual behaviour of bighorn rams of the Sheep River population and documented rut-related constraints on foraging behaviour, change in body mass, number of lungworm larvae, survival and longevity. First, I studied the social organization of rams, because social rank appears to be the most important determinant of access to estrous ewes during the rut. Consequently, the establishment of social rank during the pre-rut is an important component of male reproductive strategy in this species. Analysis of more than 2800 social interactions (collected from 2000 to 2004) revealed that rams are organized in a linear and stable dominance hierarchy. The main factors affecting social rank are age and body mass, with mass being increasingly important as males age. Second, I investigated how individual characteristics affect foraging behaviour during the non-reproductive (pre-rut) and reproductive (<b>rut)</b> <b>periods.</b> To achieve this, I constructed rams' individual time budgets, lasting between 8 to 10 hours, during both periods. I first studied the relation between individual characteristics and male time budget and found that body mass was the most important factor affecting daily foraging time during the pre-rut. Then, I investigated how the two main mating tactics (tending and coursing) used by rams during the rut affected their foraging behaviour. Using time budgets, I compared how a male's individual behaviour changes during the rut compared to the pre-rut. Males spent from 15 to 20 % less time foraging during the breeding season. Contrary to expectations, when the same ram was observed both coursing and tending within the same rut, it appeared that coursing imposed more foraging constraints than the main mating tactic of tending. Third, I studied the relation between reproductive effort and fecal output of Protostrongylus spp. (lungworm) larvae. Although age and social rank did not affect counts of larvae, sheep appeared to trade between reproduction and parasitism. Counts increase in both sexes during the period of highest reproductive investment as compared to availability of resources: late gestation in female and the rut in males. Males involved in more searching activities during the rut had higher counts than other males. Lactating ewes also had higher counts than non-lactating ones. Because I found the same trends in the patterns of larvae output in relation to reproductive effort for both genders but at different periods of the year, the hypothesis of a trade-off between current reproduction and parasitism appears to be the more parsimonious to explain sexe results. Lastly, I analyzed the effects of reproductive activities on survival and longevity, using the long-term database for 1989 - 2002. During fourteen rutting seasons, social rank and individual behaviour (proportion of ewes tended, proportion of coursing attendances and daily distance searching) was monitored. Although those indexes are indirect measurements of male mating effort, one can assume that more active males during the rut make the greatest reproductive effort. If there is a trade-off between current and future reproduction as predicted by life history theory, I should have found lower survival for more active individuals. However, there was no relation between winter survival and activity during the rut. Longevity was positively correlated with the level of rutting activities: some individuals seem to be able to invest in current reproduction without compromising future reproduction. It appears that for polygynous ungulates such as bighorn sheep, heterogeneity in individual quality hides potential reproductive costs. For this species, it is therefore not possible to demonstrate a trade-off in resource allocation between current and future reproduction using phenotypic correlations. Although reproduction is energically costly, males with a higher reproductive success are more dominant, heavier and have greater longevity. During the rut, those males use the primary mating tactic of tending, known to impose less foraging constraints without leading to a greater mass loss. Consequently, in bighorn rams, reproductive effort is probably not correlated to reproductive success. In conclusion, in complex systems (such as life-history trade-offs), where there is a large potential individual variability in resource acquisition, positive associations between fitness components may be common. In polygynous ungulates, where reproduction is monopolized by a few high-quality individuals, a small initial advantage in resource acquisition is likely to lead to an increase in returns. In such a situation, individuals able to acquire enough resources to invest in reproduction and survival will be selected, leading to a positive association between fitness components...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{importance}} of red deer Cervus elaphus for hunting and conservation purposes, understanding the interactions between this species and its habitats in the Mediterranean region is a crucial step for the sustainable management of this species. Aiming to compare pellet group counts and direct observations methods to study the habitat use and selection by red deer, the results obtained by both methods were compared, and their advantages and disadvantages were discussed. To understand the temporal patterns of habitat use and selection, the survey was conducted at three different seasons, birth <b>period,</b> <b>rut</b> season and winter. The habitat use and selection were studied in relation to land cover, watercourse, roads, ecotone zones and other topographic features (altitude, slope and aspect), using generalized linear models and selection ratios. The similarity of the results provided by pellet group counts and direct observations indicate that both methods may constitute useful tools to study the habitat use and selection by red deer. Globally, red deer seemed to select habitats that provide simultaneously food and some cover, as shown by its preference for shrublands, independently of the sampling season. The positive selection of ecotone zones embodies the need for open spaces. Males and females showed a similar use of shrubland, but selected patches with different characteristics therein. The spatial and temporal patterns exhibited by our results suggest that red deer balance their habitat requirements in respect to each phase of their reproductive cycle. Pellet group counts and direct observations seem to be useful methods to analyze habitat use and selection, and may provide helpful knowledge to the management and conservation of red deer...|$|R

Mature bulls are in breeding condition from mid-September until early December. The <b>rutting</b> <b>period</b> extends from mid-October to the first week in November, mainly from October 20 to 25. The blastocyst implants about 27 to 29 days after mating. The corpus luteum attains its maximum size and vascularity at the time of implantation; retrogressive changes commence about 2 months prepartum...|$|E
40|$|Information {{concerning}} orangutans {{living in}} the wild {{and the issue of}} their breeding has been summarized within the framework of this thesis. Orangutans in their natural habitats in tropical rainforests of Sumatra and Borneo are not subjected to the same influences as those bred in captivity. Their reproduction thus differs in certain aspects. Reproduction of orangutans in the wild is strongly influenced by their solitary way of life. Females are accompanied only by their young or eventually by other females and according to the studies they seek contact with males only in their <b>period</b> of <b>rut.</b> The contact is then limited to a period of time needed for copulation. One exception to this behaviour may be couples with juvenile males. After birth, the female looks after the young male for up to 8 years, having no <b>rut</b> during this <b>period.</b> The cycle of females {{living in the}} wild also shows dependency on the availability of food supply. Negative energy balance during which the cycle stops has been observed during periods of food scarcity. In the following period with abundance of food, the cycle is renewed again. The cycle renewal also occurs in cases when the female loses her young. As a consequence of these reproductive limitations females may give birth to 4 young at maximum in their life. Guidelines have been drawn up for breeding in zoos which regulate the conditions and suitability of the exhibits so that they meet the orangutans needs. Their natural mental and physical activity is related to their health and natural behaviour. However, despite all efforts the zoos cannot provide the same conditions to the orangutans as those they would have in the wild. The forced increased socialization and contact with other individuals held in captivity may bring stress, stereotype behaviour and associated health problems which are rather frequent with orangutans bred in captivity. According to the records in the pedigree books, the age of first reproduction and the interval between births were shorter in case of females kept in captivity. Even the keeping of males and females in one exhibit increases the probability of copulation and becoming pregnant. These changes also entail certain risks according to the studies. Breeding in captivity embodies higher mortality rate of young and adult animals. This is probably caused by young age of females at the birth and short intervals between births which are often shorter than 4 years. Females born in captivity also lack experience which they gain in the wild by learning and observing and are not {{able to take care of}} their young or refuse it later. Even females that got pregnant between the age of 11 and 14 have been described. However, such pregnancy poses a great risk for females and they die soon after birth or live much shorter. Young orangutans born in captivity were often taken away from their mothers. It is not very suitable on the one side, but on the other side, after having their young taken away from them, the females started a new, full-fledged cycle in a few weeks and could become pregnant again. However, as direct care of the young by humans has a negative effect, the young are often given back to their mothers which is successful in many cases. Orangutans have been studied for more than 40 years and a lot of things concerning their breeding in captivity have changed during this time. Zoological gardens are trying to provide the orangutans as natural conditions as possible. It is necessary for the exhibits and the enrichment to provide enough physical and mental activities to the orangutans. Despite these efforts, the limited space and the related contacts between individuals may bring stressful situations. These are then manifested in the behaviour and health of the orangutans...|$|R
40|$|Group size {{variations}} of the Arabian sand gazelle Gazella subgutturosa marica were studied {{during a period of}} drought at the Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area in central western Saudi Arabia. Significant differences in median group sizes were observed between all seasons except summer. Single animals were observed mainly during summer while group sizes exceeding 10 individuals were observed mainly during winter. Solitary male and female groups were typically observed during winter and mixed groups mainly during the autumn <b>rutting</b> <b>period.</b> Most mixed groups were two to four times larger during winter than summer. The adult sex ratio (male: female) for all seasons combined was in parity and highest during autumn (1 : 1. 23), probably as a result of prolonged drought conditions. The variability in group structure related to environmental conditions may be one factor permitting G. s. marica to adapt to hyper-arid habitats and climatic regimes in central western Saudi Arabia. The value of continuous monitoring of the gazelle population is emphasised for this drought prone regio...|$|E
40|$|The {{foraging}} behaviour of a feral {{cattle population}} in southwest Spain was studied. Descriptive variables of intake behaviour (i. e. bite rate, step rate and bite/step ratio) were influenced both by extrinsic factors (food abundance {{and type of}} plant community) and by an intrinsic factor (individual body size). The type of plant community decisively influenced the grazing behaviour of animals. Food abundance affected the foraging behaviour, but was not independent from the type of plant community. Body size influenced the foraging behaviour depending {{on the level of}} food availability. Small and medium-sized animals (juveniles, sub-adults and adult females) were more selective in their diet than larger animals (adult males) and changed their foraging behaviour according to the level of food abundance in order to maintain intakes of preferred food. Differences in foraging behaviour among size classes could be related to the sexual segregation between adult males and females out of the <b>rutting</b> <b>period.</b> © 1993. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{excursion}} behaviour of roe does was {{studied for}} two years in a low density population (ca. 6. 5 ind. / 100 ha), in an Apennine-continental forest of Southern Italy, through satellite radiotracking. During the <b>rutting</b> <b>period,</b> our radiotagged does (N = 6) moved well outside their summer ranges, with an average exploration area eight times greater than summer ranges. The median duration of excursions was 51 h (range: 10 – 99 h). One female stayed away for a total of 11 days. In order further to understand this behaviour, we reviewed all studies (N = 6) dealing with excursion behaviour of roe does and carried out in areas where population density was assessed through the same method (i. e. drive counts). Out of five ecological parameters included in the analysis, excursion behaviour of roe does was found significantly and negatively associated only to population density: when density was low, the proportion of roaming does increased, probably because of the lower availability of “free” bucks during the short time of female oestrou...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve and}} develop a {{management}} system for reindeer husbandry regarding minimizing depredation by brown bears, knowledge about current depredation patterns is required. Using data obtained from a predation study regarding brown bear predation on reindeer from 2010 to 2012 I aimed at investigating what solutions are available to minimize brown bear predation on reindeer calves. This study has shown that predation on reindeer calves by brown bears {{in relation to the}} dates of birth for the calves in the study area was delayed by approximately one week. It has also shown that bears stopped killing reindeer calves approximately one week after the last calf in the studied herds was born. Mobility of the reindeer calves is assumed to be a determining factor affecting hunting success, since encounters then decrease. The two most feasible ways to minimize predation by brown bears can be to; 1) ensure that there is an adequate proportion of male reindeer in the herds so that all female reindeer are mated during the first <b>rutting</b> <b>period</b> and; 2) to minimize human disturbances during sensitive periods such as the rutting and calving period...|$|E
40|$|Supplementary feeding is a {{widespread}} game management practice in several red deer (Cervus elaphus) populations, with important potential consequences on the biology of this species. InMediterranean ecosystems food supplementation occurs in the <b>rutting</b> <b>period,</b> when it may change mating system characteristics. We studied the role of food supplementation relative to natural resources in the spatial distribution, aggregation, and mean harem size of females in Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) during the rut. We studied 30 red deer populations of southwestern Spain, 63 % of which experienced supplementary feeding. Using multivariate spatial analyses we found that food supplementation affected distribution of females in 95 % of the populations in which it occurred. Green meadows present during the mating season acted as an important natural resource influencing female distribution. Additionally, the level of female aggregation and mean harem size were significantly higher in those populations in which food supplementation determined female distribution than in populations in which female distribution did not depend on supplementary feeding. Because female aggregation and mean harem size are key elements in sexual selection, supplementary feeding may constitute an important anthropogenic element with potential evolutionary implications for populations of Iberian red deer...|$|E
40|$|Landscape {{heterogeneity}} plays {{a central}} role in shaping ecological and evolutionary processes. While species utilization of the landscape is usually viewed as constant within a year, the spatial distribution of individuals is likely to vary in time in relation to particular seasonal needs. Understanding temporal variation in landscape use and genetic connectivity has direct conservation implications. Here, we modelled the daily use of the landscape by caribou in Quebec and Labrador, Canada and tested its ability to explain the genetic relatedness among individuals. We assessed habitat selection using locations of collared individuals in migratory herds and static occurrences from sedentary groups. Connectivity models based on habitat use outperformed a baseline isolation-by-distance model in explaining genetic relatedness, suggesting that variations in landscape features such as snow, vegetation productivity and land use modulate connectivity among populations. Connectivity surfaces derived from habitat use were the best predictors of genetic relatedness. The relationship between connectivity surface and genetic relatedness varied in time and peaked during the <b>rutting</b> <b>period.</b> Landscape permeability in the period of mate searching is especially important to allow gene flow among populations. Our study highlights the importance of considering temporal variations in habitat selection for optimizing connectivity across heterogeneous landscape and counter habitat fragmentation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} how often spermiogenesis occurs in young male European bison up to 3 years old. Research was performed on sections of the testes and epididymes collected from 51 male bison aged 2 - 3 years. The animals were divided into 2 age groups: young males up to 2 years and young males up to 3 years old, with further separation into specimens with or without spermiogenesis. The animals were culled during the autumn-winter seasons in 1994 - 2008 (after <b>rutting</b> <b>period)</b> in the Bialowieża Primeval Forest. Spermiogenesis in the 2 -year-old animals was a rare condition found in 16. 7 % of cases. However, at the age of 3 years more than half of the individuals examined (53. 3 %) had spermiogenesis. Young males up to 2 years old with spermioge-nesis were characterized by a significantly higher body weight and their right testis also weighed more than the left testis of the animals without spermiogenesis, the difference being on the border of statistical significance. There was no significant differences in the body mass and weight of the left testis between older animals, up to 3 years old, with or without spermiogenesis. However, young males up to 3 years old with spermiogenesis were characterized by a significantly higher weight of the right testis than those without spermiogenesis.

40|$|We {{investigated}} group size, grouping {{patterns and}} sexual segregation in feral goats on the Isle of Rum (NW Scotland) from January 1981 to September 1982 and May to November 2000. A total of 7396 groups of feral goats were recorded, comprising 30356 adult individuals and 13119 yearlings and kids. The most commonly observed group size was 1 - 3 individuals. Mean group size was larger in 2000 than in 1981 - 82, possibly reflecting {{an increase in}} population size. In both study periods, group size varied throughout the year: mean group size was smallest in late winter and early spring, and increased through summer to reach a maximum during the August/September <b>rutting</b> <b>period.</b> Mixed-sex groups were larger than single sex groups. Feral goats on Rum showed obvious social segregation during late spring and summer months (April to July) as demonstrated by a lower percentage of mixed-sex groups, lower proportions of adult males and females observed in mixed-sex groups and a higher social segregation coefficient in these months. The {{extent to which the}} population became sexually segregated correlated most strongly with daylength. This probably reflects the goats' pattern of habitat use during foraging: large mixed sex parties, which use caves for overnight shelter, forage slowly up the hill sides during the day, gradually dispersing more widely as they go. In winter months, when days are short, the animals are able to move less far, and so become less dispersed. © Publications Scientifiques du Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle...|$|E
