40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the circumstances in}} which a party to an arbitration agreement may be deemed to have waived its right to arbitrate a dispute comprehended by the agreement, by involvement in litigation concerning this dispute. The focus is on the law in common law jurisdictions, particularly Australia and the United States of America. United Kingdom law will also be briefly surveyed. The paper focuses on the 2006 decision of the Australian Federal Court in Comandate Marine Corp v Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd, which afforded the topic significant treatment. The theoretical bases for sustaining waiver claims are analysed, including waiver as a discrete doctrine, abandonment, estoppel, election, <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and variation of contract. The policies that underlie and inform the development of principles for testing waiver submissions are noted...|$|E

40|$|The optimal {{fiscal policy}} is countercyclical, aiming {{to keep the}} output close to its potential. Nevertheless, it has been pointed out that {{developing}} countries are unable to run countercyclical fiscal policies. Several researchers have attributed these sub optimal fiscal policies to two groups of arguments. (i) The limited access to domestic or external funds may hinder the ability of government to pursue expansionary fiscal policy in bad time. (ii)   The second group of factors explains that sub-optimal fiscal policies are associated with institutional theories. The standard argument suggests that countries pursuing poor fiscal policies have, also, weak institutions, widespread corruption, and lack of property rights and <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The main goal {{of this paper is}} to analyze empirically if the ability of MENA countries to conduct countercyclical fiscal policy is affected by the quality of their institutions, the nature of political regime and/or by the availability of financial resources either on the local or international capital markets. From our fiscal policy regression, we find that government expenditure in MENA region is procyclical. We conclude that MENA countries are unable to run countercyclical fiscal policies if they have weak institutions, small access to international, domestic credit market, and democratic political regime. </p...|$|E

40|$|Institutions are {{the rules}} of the game in a society by which the members of a society work together, shape the {{economic}} behaviour of agents and help explain the economic performance of countries. This paper attempts to empirically investigate the link between institutional quality and economic performance in a group of 72 countries during 1980 – 2001, using the dynamic panel data analysis. Five institutional indicators that represent the overall institutional infrastructure of an economy are employed, namely corruption, rule <b>of</b> law, bureaucracy, <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> and risk <b>of</b> expropriation. The empirical results demonstrate that institutions variables are statistically significant determinants of economic performance. The finding also suggests that the effects of institutional quality vary according to the level of economic development, where institutions are more responsive in the low-income and middle-income countries. In terms of specific effects of institutional development, the results reveal that the higher level of rule of law is most potent in delivering long-run economic benefits...|$|R

Ethnic diversity has a more adverse effect on economic policy and growth when a government's institutions are poor.

In countries where the institutions are good enough, however, ethnic diversity does not lessen growth or worsen economic policies. Good institutions also {{reduce the risk of}} wars and genocides that might otherwise result from ethnic fractionalization. However, these forms of violence are not the channel through which ethnic fragmentation and its interaction with institutions affect economic growth.

The primary purpose of the minimum quantity clause was the pricing of that service.

50|$|On September 26, 1918, the {{government}} made {{a contract with}} Hartsville Oil Mill, a cottonseed producer, which was replicated with several other cottonseed producers for the delivery of cotton linters.

Of the production of 2,250,000 pounds, 270,000 bales were on hand and inspected when armistice was declared in late 1918.

40|$|If a {{party to}} an {{employment}} contract commits a repudiatory dismissal or resignation, {{it has long been}} unclear whether the other party has the option either to terminate or affirm the contract (the elective theory) or whether the former's breach operates to bring the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> employment to an end (the automatic theory). The recent decision of the Supreme Court in Société Générale (London Branch) v Geys has finally resolved this question.

5000|$|... ==Repudiation and retraction== A {{party is}} {{considered}} to have repudiated a contract when they evidence a lack of willingness or an inability to perform their contractual obligations. A <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>contract</b> by one party (the repudiating party) will entitle the other party (the aggrieved party) to elect to terminate the contract. This is based on objective intentions i.e. the repudiating party's words or conduct.; This unwillingness or inability to perform a condition must deprive the aggrieved party of substantially {{the whole of the}} benefit that they would have received if the remaining obligations were performed under the contract. When such an event occurs, the performing party to the contract is excused from having to fulfill his or her obligations. However, the repudiation can be retracted by the promising party so long as there has been no material change in the position of the performing party in the interim. A retraction <b>of</b> the <b>repudiation</b> restores the performer's obligation to perform on the contract.|$|R
50|$|The case concerned, in {{the first}} place, the remedy <b>of</b> <b>repudiation</b> for breach <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The {{purchaser}} had failed to pay {{a portion of the}} purchase price in terms of the deed of sale. The seller alleged that such non-payment constituted repudiation, accepted by the seller. Failure to pay obviously constituted breach <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> in light <b>of</b> the requirement in the contract in question that payment be made on signature of the agreement. The court assumed such breach to constitute repudiation. The seller, however, only purported to cancel the contract more than two years after the conclusion of the agreement, and after having accepted monthly payments on the balance of the purchase price. In such circumstances, the seller was not summarily entitled to accept repudiation and cancel the contract.|$|R
40|$|On the 19 th December 2012 the Supreme Court {{provided}} {{an answer to}} the longstanding question as to the consequences of a wrongfully repudiated <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> employment. Was it for the innocent party to elect to accept the repudiation to bring the contract to an end? Or, was the contract automatically ended upon the wrongful repudiation? Previous authorities had moved between these elective and automatic theories. The elective theory held that a wrongful repudiation only became effective where the innocent party elected to accept the repudiation. Conversely, the automatic theory considered that the contract ended automatically upon the repudiation. Whilst in traditional contract law, the elective theory had been established as effective, this was not decided with authority in <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> employment. In Geys, the Supreme Court had the opportunity to consider which was the applicable theory in relation to an employer’s use of a payment-in-lieu of notice (PILON) clause. The Court resolved the conflict (4 - 1 with Lord Sumption dissenting) by holding that the elective theory was preferred in instances <b>of</b> wrongful <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> employment.

40|$|In the April {{number of}} this journal Professor Joseph H. Beale, Jr., sets forth very clearly the {{principles}} governing {{the measure of}} damages in cases <b>of</b> anticipatory <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>contract.</b> It seems to the writer than in one respect only is a criticism {{to be made of}} his analysis. Professor Heale shows convincingly that where 2 ̆ 2 the plaintiff sues at once for an anticipatory breach <b>of</b> the <b>contract,</b> his damages are to be assessed according to the cost of performance, not {{at the time of the}} breach, but at the time set for p 2 ̆ 2 erformance. 2 ̆ 2 To this rule, however, he says there may be one exception: where parties have made a contract for the future delivery of a commodityof such a nature that the right to its future delivery has a present market value, and an anticipatory breach occurs, the measure of the damages is not the value <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> at the time for performance, but the value <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> at the time of the breach. The example given is a sale of oats for July delivery, and a repudiation occurs in April.

50|$|Following {{the passage}} of a Senate Resolution {{numbered}} 448 on March 23, 1922, referring Senate bill numbered 4479 March 3, 1922 to the Court of Federal Claims, the producers filed a case with the Court of Claims requesting they investigate the matter and report to the Senate. However, the Court of Claims determined that it held jurisdiction over the contract dispute under Judicial Code § 7 and heard the case under its Article III jurisdiction. While the producers alleged that they had been forced to agree to the modification <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> under duress <b>of</b> the government's threat <b>of</b> <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> the original <b>contract,</b> the Court <b>of</b> Claims held that there was no duress. They reasoned that the producers negotiated with the government for several weeks and that the government gave up concessions which constituted consideration for contractual purposes. As such, there was no duress as the plaintiffs had substantial time, prior to agreeing to the modification, to seek redress {{in a court of law}} for their claims under the original contract and that therefore the remedies at law were not inadequate as to invoke the doctrine of duress.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{employs a}} game-theoretic {{framework}} and a comparative historical analysis {{to study the}} impact of the Great Depression on corporate welfarism,' i. e., employers' voluntary provisions of non-wage benefits, greater employment security, and employee representation to their blue-collar workers. By characterizing corporate welfarism as an implicit contract equilibrium, the paper documents parallel institutional developments in the U. S. and Japan towards corporate welfarism during the 1920 s and identifies the early 1930 s as a bifurcation point at which the two trajectories began to diverge toward two distinctive equilibria. In the U.

Experiencing a less severe depression, most major employers in Japan maintained their implicit contracts, while developing institutional arrangements to mitigate the cost of long-term commitment. In contrast to the U. S., labor laws in Japan developed complementary to private welfare practices, endorsing corporate welfarism based on implicit contracts and internal enforcement mechanisms. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{employs a}} game-theoretic {{framework}} and comparative historical approach to study an institutional change triggered by an extraordinary shock — the Great Depression. By characterizing “corporate welfarism ” practiced by large manufacturing {{firms in the}} U.

By contrast, during a less severe depression, a majority of Japanese large com-panies kept their implicit contracts, while developing institutional arrangements to mitigate a negative impact of business fluctuation. The paper then attributes the irreversibility of the institutional change after the Depression to the endogenous formation of complementary institutions, such as union laws, enforcement agencies, and state welfare programs...|$|R
