5000|$|As {{an example}} of this {{consider}} a <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> that lowers below the alternate depth of the flow described above (1.4 ft). If the <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> is lowered to a depth of 1 ft, the flow described above will not be possible. The energy required to pass through the <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> at the flow conditions described will not be sufficient. In this case, a [...] "choke" [...] is encountered at the <b>sluice</b> <b>gate.</b> The energy required to pass with downstream depth of 1 ft can be calculated using Equation [...]|$|R
50|$|If a <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> {{is lowered}} into a {{subcritical}} flow {{to a depth}} lower than the critical depth, the flow downstream of the <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> will become supercritical and this downstream depth will be the alternate depth {{as seen in the}} figure below where the <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> is lowered to a depth of 2 ft (< yc = 2.3 ft and > y2 = 1.4 ft).|$|R

Swamee (1992) presents two formulas for calculating the discharge coefficient (Cd) for free flow and submerged flow based on Henry 2 ̆ 7 s Curve (1950). Laboratory models {{used to find}} out the flow phenomenon that was formed due to a difference in the edge shape of the <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> and increased gate base.

The discharge coefficient (Cd) value on the <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> with edge 450 is higher than the discharge coefficient (Cd) value on the gate with edge 900.

It is generally difficult to achieve efficient water resources management merely through manually operating the <b>sluice</b> <b>gates.</b> Therefore, an artificial intelligence modelling system for managing the water resources in the channel network of Pudong New District has been developed by combining hydrodynamic simulation with an artificial intelligence technique. The artificial neural network model is used to develop <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> operation procedures according to the water levels in both the outer and inner rivers. The hydrodynamic model is used to simulate the flow discharges and water levels based on the <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> operation procedures.
