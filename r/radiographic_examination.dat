25|$|A bone {{fracture}} may be diagnosed {{based on the}} history given and the physical examination performed. Radiographic imaging often is performed to confirm the diagnosis. Under certain circumstances, <b>radiographic</b> <b>examination</b> of the nearby joints is indicated in order to exclude dislocations and fracture-dislocations. In situations where projectional radiography alone is insufficient, Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may be indicated.|$|E
25|$|X-ray imaging {{of the hip}} is {{most often}} unremarkable. Subtle {{radiographic}} signs include an accentuated pericapsular shadow, widening of the medial joint space, lateral displacement of the femoral epiphyses with surface flattening (Waldenström sign), prominent obturator shadow, diminution of soft tissue planes around the hip joint or slight demineralisation of the proximal femur. The main reason for <b>radiographic</b> <b>examination</b> is to exclude bony lesions such as occult fractures, slipped upper femoral epiphysis or bone tumours (such as osteoid osteoma). An anteroposterior and frog lateral (Lauenstein) view of the pelvis and both hips is advisable.|$|E
500|$|Guttural Pouch Tympany (GPT) {{occurs in}} horses ranging {{from birth to}} 1 year of age and {{is more common in}} fillies than in colts. It is thought to be genetic in Arabians, {{possibly}} polygenic in inheritance, but more study is needed. Foals are born with a defect that causes the pharyngeal opening of the eustachian tube to act like a one-way valve [...] air can get in, but it cannot get out. The affected guttural pouch is distended with air and forms a characteristic nonpainful swelling. Breathing is noisy in severely affected animals. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and <b>radiographic</b> <b>examination</b> of the skull. Medical management with NSAID and antimicrobial therapy can treat upper respiratory tract inflammation. Surgical intervention is needed to correct the malformation of the guttural pouch opening, to provide a route for air in the abnormal guttural pouch to pass to the normal side and be expelled into the pharynx. Foals that are successfully treated may grow up to have fully useful lives.|$|E

500|$|The cardiac {{pathologist}} {{who studied}} Schiavo's heart found {{it and the}} coronary vessels to be healthy, which excludes the possibility that her initial collapse {{was the result of}} myocardial infarction, although there was a localized area of healed inflammation (opening the possibility of myocarditis). Thogmartin found that [...] "there was no proof that Terri Schiavo ever had an eating disorder such as bulimia." [...] Regarding the possibility of strangulation or domestic violence as a cause of Schiavo's initial collapse, the report states: [...] "No trauma was noted on any of the numerous physical exams or radiographs performed on Mrs. Schiavo on the day of, in the days after, or in the months after her initial collapse. Indeed, within an hour of her initial hospital admission, <b>radiographic</b> <b>examination</b> of her cervical spine was negative. Specifically, external signs of strangulation including cutaneous or deep neck injury, facial/conjunctival petechiae, and other blunt trauma were not observed or recorded during her initial hospital admission. Autopsy examination of her neck structures 15 years after her initial collapse did not detect any signs of remote trauma, but, with such a delay, the exam was unlikely to show any residual neck findings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Periodontitis {{is caused}} by {{microorganisms}} that adhere to and grow on the tooth's surfaces, along with an over-aggressive immune response against these microorganisms. A diagnosis of periodontitis is established by inspecting the soft gum tissues around the teeth with a probe (i.e., a clinical examination) and by evaluating the patient's X-ray films (i.e., a <b>radiographic</b> <b>examination),</b> to {{determine the amount of}} bone loss around the teeth. Specialists in the treatment of periodontitis are periodontists; their field is known as [...] "periodontology" [...] or [...] "periodontics".|$|E
2500|$|Because time {{is such an}} {{essential}} factor in emergency treatment, EDs typically have their own diagnostic equipment to avoid waiting for equipment installed elsewhere in the hospital.

Laboratory services may be handled on a priority basis by the hospital lab, or the ED may have its own [...] "STAT Lab" [...] for basic labs (blood counts, blood typing, toxicology screens, etc.) that must be returned very rapidly.|$|E

50|$|Multiview videofluoroscopy is a {{radiographic}} technique, {{mostly to}} demonstrate the lateral and posterior wall of the pharynx.

40|$|M. Tech. (Radiography) Satisfied {{patients}} {{are recognized as}} an important outcome measure for {{evaluating the quality of}} medical care provided in a hospital setting. A satisfied patient is more likely to comply with instructions given and cooperate with medical staff during procedures such as special <b>radiographic</b> <b>examinations</b> in the radiography department. In Malawi, studies on patient satisfaction have mostly been confined to doctor – patient interaction and other aspects of the health care service. Very little research has been conducted to explore the experiences of patients undergoing special <b>radiographic</b> <b>examinations.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the experiences of patients undergoing special <b>radiographic</b> <b>examinations</b> at Kamuzu Central Hospital. A qualitative, contextual, explorative, descriptive approach was used to collect data from patients undergoing special <b>radiographic</b> <b>examinations</b> at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Malawi. Focus group interviews were employed to collect data from the study participants. A total number of 15 patients took part in the study. A content analysis approach was used to analyze the views of the participants. The themes that emerged from the focus group data were: Concerns about delays from reception to receiving radiography results (Radiographs and report); Patients’ experiences with regards to the quality of patient care they received and Concerns about the hospital environment and resources in the radiography department. Guidelines have been proposed to address the themes identified...|$|R

The authors report the case of sialolithiasis of the submandibular gland in a 42 -year-old, female, white-skinned patient, noticed during routine dental examination.

40|$|Orthognathic {{surgery is}} a {{frequent}} procedure at Swedish Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Departments. The number of clinical and <b>radiographic</b> postoperative follow-up <b>examinations</b> and the choice of radiographic methods seem to vary. The intention with {{this study was to}} find out when postoperative clinical and radiographic follow-up was performed following orthognathic surgery and the type of <b>radiographic</b> <b>examinations</b> that were used. In 2009, all Swedish Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Departments in the Public Health Service (25 centres) were given a form containing standardized questions on the time for clinical follow-up after orthognathic surgery and the <b>radiographic</b> <b>examinations</b> used. A pilot study on 49 consecutive patients at one of the centres was performed to determine if the postoperative <b>radiographic</b> <b>examinations</b> added additional information, leading to further procedures compared to the clinical observations only. A one-year follow-up was the most frequently used clinical control reported by 15 centres, and a six-month follow-up, the next most frequent. At 14 of the 15 centres, <b>radiographic</b> <b>examinations</b> were included at the one-year follow-up. A five-year clinical and radiographic follow-up was reported by two centres. One or, at the most, two postoperative radiographic follow-up sessions were reported by 68 % of the centres. Profile and panoramic imaging were most often used. In the evaluation of the postoperative handling of the 49 consecutive patients in the pilot study, a radiolucency around a fixation screw noted radiographically was the only additional postoperative radiological finding that resulted in a surgical procedure. Postoperative clinical and radiographic follow-up routines following orthognathic surgery vary considerably between the Swedish Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Departments. There appears to be a need for studies on the value of the information,which repeated postoperative clinical and radiographic follow-up controls add in routine medical attendance...|$|R
