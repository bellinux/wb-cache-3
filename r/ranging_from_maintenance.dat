40|$|Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a {{transcription}} factor regulating {{a wide array}} of genes mediating numerous cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, motility and survival, to name a few. Aberrant activation of NF-κB is a frequent event in numerous cancers, including glioblastoma, the most common and lethal form of brain tumours of glial cell origin (collectively termed gliomas). Glioblastoma is characterized by high cellular heterogeneity, resistance to therapy and almost inevitable recurrence after surgery and treatment. NF-κB is aberrantly activated in response to a variety of stimuli in glioblastoma, where its activity has been implicated in processes <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> <b>maintenance</b> of cancer stem-like cells, stimulation of cancer cell invasion, promotion of mesenchymal identity, and resistance to radiotherapy. This review examines the mechanisms of NF-κB activation in glioblastoma, the involvement of NF-κB in several mechanisms underlying glioblastoma propagation, and discusses some of the important questions of future research into the roles of NF-κB in glioblastoma...|$|E

Research was conducted on three different systems, aimed at improving the areas of ‘The Village’ both economically and environmentally; the areas of focus were vineyard installation, fire resistant landscaping, and low impact development installations. The process began with evaluating the sites physical and judicial restraints. Soils tests, topography calculations, climate records, and preexisting species identifications were conducted; documents regarding water rights, installation restrictions, site history, and zone regulations were also collected. Interviews were conducted with all relatable parties, including local fire authority, board members from the Homeowners Association, vineyard lesser and lessee, and LID specialists. All potential benefits and drawbacks of each installation were compared and contrasted between the three areas of focus, on levels <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs to long run ecological factors.

They {{are essential for}} growth of all eukaryotic cells but when produced in an uncontrolled manner can lead to cell death and pathologies including auto-immune reactions, cancer, diabetes and neurodegeneration. Caenorhabditis elegans is an important genetic model organism both to find new drug-targets against parasitic nematodes and to study the conserved roles of sphingolipids in animals like their essential functions in very basic cellular processes <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> <b>maintenance</b> of cell polarity and mitochondrial repair to growth and survival. C. elegans produces sphingoid bases which are structurally distinct from those of other animals as both iso- and anteiso-branched species have been reported. Using metabolic labeling we show that most worm sphingoid bases are iso-branched. We have synthesized the nematode- specific C 17 iso-branched sphinganine and its 1 -deoxy analogue and could show that both the iso-branch and the 1 -hydroxyl group are essential to form functional nematode sphingolipids which are needed to maintain intestinal function. The organism specificity was examined by complementation experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells lacking sphingoid base synthesis. We found that iso-branched sphingoid base did not support growth of mutant cells and was toxic to wild type yeast. 1 -Deoxy sphingolipids {{have been linked to}} the hereditary disease HSAN 1 A and other metabolic disorders including diabetes. We found that in C. elegans the 1 -deoxy analogue cannot rescue the intestinal phenotype caused by sphingoid base depletion.

40|$|In Sicily, the {{academic}} botanical gardens of Catania, Messina and Palermo have been historically exerting {{a multiplicity of}} activities <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> <b>maintenance</b> of ex situ collections to plant conservation policy, practice and ecological restoration, along with more traditional functions related to education and academic research. In the last decade’s, two new botanical gardens the “Nuova Gussonea” and the “Bernardino da Ucria, were created in Sicily, with the aim to play more delimited, yet modern and complementary roles. The garden “Nuova Gussonea”, within the Etna Natural Park, is mostly devoted to collect and preserve the native flora of the Mount Etna, with a special focus on endemic and rare plants and their promotion to a wider public. The garden “Bernardino da Ucria”, in the Nebrodi Natural Park, is mainly specialized in promoting the local culture and to collect and preserve the agro-biodiversity of officinal plants in the Nebrodi territory. It {{is located in the}} homonymous village in the Messina district where the famous “demonstrator of plants” and co founder of the Botanical Garden of Palermo University was born. Noteworthy, within Sicily the Nebrodi area is undoubtedly the widest and richest in traditional activities regarding agriculture, sheep farming and sylviculture, which produced an agrobiodiversity heritage often representative of individual community cultures. Initially promoted by Palermo University and sustained by the Nebrodi Regional Park, this garden comprises the “Banca vivente del Germoplasma vegetale dei Nebrodi”. Accessions conserved in vivo so far include cultivars of crops (Corylus, Pyrus, Malus, Prunus sp. pl, Ficus, Juglans), vegetables (Phaseolus and Lycopersicum) and officinal plants, that are in part representative of local agricultural practices. Among crops, the collections of Ficus, Pyrus and Corylus are remarkable; while among vegetables, the beans (Phaseolus) are represented by over 65 distinct cultivars, comprising 57 climbing and 8 dwarf species (1). Additionally, the garden’s bank hosts several botanical collections unrelated to the local flora, representative of officinal and ornamental genus, such as Salvia, Helleborus, Paeonia and Camelia. The cryopreserved accessions so far encompass the bean cultivars, mainly found within the Nebrodi Park area. The aim of this particular collection is to further exploit the local agricultural and food heritage by recovering and spreading among local farmers of autochthonous cultivars under extinction risk. Moreover, the garden has recently been equipped with a molecular biology laboratory, performing studies on the genetic diversity of the accessions, as well as activities instrumental {{to the creation of a}} related DNA bank, interconnected with the Palermo Botanical garden bank (HBP-Bank). In 2011, the botanical garden of Ucria hosted the Summer School “Knowledge, conservation and management of plant biodiversity of the Mediterranean mountain systems”, organized by Palermo University together with OPTIMA, and financially sponsored by the Nebrodi Park. Similarly, the Summer School “Management of plant biodiversity in the Mediterranean: ex situ conservation and germplasm banks” will be held in 2016. The activities of the new Ucria botanical garden and its germplasm bank, is supported by a dedicated Consortium, established by the Nebrodi Park together with Palermo University. The botanical garden “Bernardino da Ucria” is open to public in the spring and summer period. It is also offering didactic visits for educational purposes to several schools...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{focuses on}} the {{possibilities}} of utilizing infrastructural RFIDs for location aware computing. A key to automated computer aided work is location and situation awareness. This allows the system to operate independently from direct user input, minimizing {{the impact on the}} original process. For demonstration purposes a large area tracking system using existing RFID technology and infrastructure is developed and evaluated. As a first possible application we embed the system into an aircraft cabin. The localization procedure is based on the coordinates of the RFID transponders detected by the RFID reader, as well as the orientation information measured by a gyroscope. Position estimation is accomplished through an iterative algorithm, optimizing the position of the antenna’s readability field with respect to the currently visible tags. The average error is below half a meter. Possible use cases <b>range</b> <b>from</b> <b>maintenance</b> assistance to way finding in commercial shops or underground parking lots. ...|$|R

Feeding rates utilized by the model <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> <b>maintenance</b> to maximum utilizable rations. The model is derived from an empirical equation for maximum growth rate, and a theoretical equation for net energy utilization. The resultant equation is modified to improve fit at higher feeding levels. Calibration is accomplished with experimentally obtained data. The model is similar to one developed by G. D. Stauffer, but represents an improvement because points on the growth curve between maintenance and maximum ration can be fitted even if maintenance and maximum requirements are obtained independently. An optimization method is then developed using this growth model that determines, for a given temperature regime, a feeding schedule that minimizes total food consumption for a given rearing period. The method is then extended to determine simultaneously feeding schedules and temperature regimes that minimize total food consumption...|$|R

These structural defects worsen as HGPS cells age in culture, and their severity correlates with an apparent increase in LAΔ 50.
