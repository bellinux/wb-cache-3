40|$|Background : A right-sided {{umbilical}} cord twist {{is associated with}} the presence of a single umbilical artery, congenital malformations and placenta praevia.   Methods:  It was an observational study. Data was collected from 137 {{umbilical cord}}s, all from live births and their patient records. The gestational ages ranged from 28 weeks to 41 weeks. The umbilical cords were categorized into right or left, based on the direction of twist. The independent sample T test and the Chi square test were used to analyze the differences between groups.   Results:  The prevalence of left twist was 84 %. <b>Right</b> <b>twist</b> was significantly associated with a larger Hyrtl’s anastomosis (p= 0. 029) and gestational diabetes (p= 0. 027).   Conclusion: Two previously unreported associations with <b>right</b> <b>twist</b> of the umbilical cord, gestational diabetes and an increase in the diameter of Hyrtl’s anastomosis, were noted in the present study. </p...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} fluid models {{consisting of}} finite buffers, constant capacities and input processes modulated by continuous time Markov chains. These models are continuous flow approximations for describing the actually discrete traffic and buffer behaviour in ATM networks. A main issue {{is to find}} good estimates of buffer overflow and loss probabilities when they are (very) small, i. e. of the order 10 − 6 or less. We present simulation results by applying importance sampling as a variance reduction technique. Using the concept of effective bandwidth we change the transition rates of the modulating Markov chains by an exponentially twist. When we do that {{in such a way}} that peak rates get longer durations, overflows will occur more frequently when executing the simulations.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{mechanical}} manipulation during the curing of conventional liquid crystal elastomers diminishes their applicability {{in the field}} of shape-programmable soft materials and future applications in additive manufacturing. Here we report on polymer-dispersed liquid crystal elastomers, novel composite materials that eliminate this difficulty. Their thermal shape memory anisotropy is imprinted by curing in external magnetic field, providing for conventional moulding of macroscopically sized soft, thermomechanically active elastic objects of general shapes. The binary soft-soft composition of isotropic elastomer matrix, filled with freeze-fracture-fabricated, oriented liquid crystal elastomer microparticles as colloidal inclusions, allows for fine-tuning of thermal morphing behaviour. This is accomplished by adjusting the concentration, spatial distribution and orientation of microparticles or using blends of microparticles with different thermomechanical characteristics. We demonstrate that any Gaussian thermomechanical deformation mode (bend, cup, saddle, left and <b>right</b> <b>twist)</b> of a planar sample, as well as beat-like actuation, is attainable with bilayer microparticle configurations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Learning to {{communicate}} with alternative augmentative communication devices can be difficult {{because of the difficulty}} of achieving controlled interaction while simultaneously learning {{to communicate}}. What is needed is a device that harnesses a child’s natural motor capabilities and provides the means to reinforce them. We present a kinematic sensor-based system that learns a child’s natural gestural capability and allows him/her to practice those capabilities {{in the context of a}} game. Movement is captured with a single kinematic sensor that can be worn anywhere on the body. A gesture recognition algorithm interactively learns gesture models using kinematic data with the help of a nearby teacher. Learned gesture models are applied in the context of a game to help the child practice gestures to gain better consistency. The system was successfully tested with a child over two sessions. The system learned four candidate gestures: lift hand, sweep <b>right,</b> <b>twist</b> right and punch forward. These were then used in a game. The child showed better consistency in performing the gestures as each session progressed. We aim to expand on this work by developing qualitative scores of movement quality and quantifying algorithm accuracy on a larger population over long periods of time...|$|E

40|$|Wrapping, crossover, and {{braiding}} of DNA are the motifs {{of fundamental}} interest in genome packaging, gene regulation, and enzyme recognition. This study explores elastic mechanisms for {{the selection of}} chirality in wrapping, crossover, and braiding of DNA based on a coarse-grained model. The DNA model consists of two elastic chains that mutually intertwine in a right-handed manner forming a double-stranded helix with the distinction between major and minor grooves. Although individual potential energy functions of the DNA model have no asymmetry in terms of left and <b>right</b> <b>twist,</b> the model as a whole exhibits an asymmetric propensity to writhe in the left direction upon bending due to the right-handed helical geometry. Monte Carlo simulations of this model suggest that DNA has a propensity to prefer left-handed wrapping around a spherical core particle and also around a uniform rod due to the asymmetric elastic coupling between bending and writhing. This result indicates an elastic origin of the uniform left-handed wrapping of DNA in nucleosomes and also has implications on the wrapping of double-stranded DNA around rod-like molecules. Monte Carlo simulations of the DNA model also suggest that two juxtaposed DNA molecules can braid each other spontaneously under moderate attractive interactions with the preference for left-handed braiding due to the asymmetric coupling between bending and writhing. This result suggests the importance of asymmetric elasticity {{in the selection of}} chirality in braiding of a pair of DNA molecules...|$|E
40|$|The {{study design}} {{included}} an in vivo laboratory study. The {{objective of the}} study is to quantify the kinematics of the lumbar spinous processes in asymptomatic patients during un-restricted functional body movements with physiological weight bearing. Limited data has been reported on the motion patterns of the posterior spine elements. This information is necessary for the evaluation of traumatic injuries and degenerative changes in the posterior elements, as well as for improving the surgical treatment of spinal diseases using posterior procedures. Eight asymptomatic subjects with an age ranging from 50 to 60  years underwent MRI scans of their lumbar segments in a supine position and 3 D models of L 2 – 5 were constructed. Next, each subject was asked to stand and was positioned in the following sequence: standing, 45 ° flexion, maximal extension, maximal left and right twisting, while two orthogonal fluoroscopic images were taken simultaneously at each of the positions. The MRI models were matched to the osseous outlines of the images from the two orthogonal views to quantify the position of the vertebrae in 3 D at each position. The data revealed that interspinous process (ISP) distance decreased from L 2 to L 3 to L 4 to L 5 when measured in the supine position; with significantly higher values at L 2 – 3 and L 3 – 4 compared with L 4 – 5. These differences were not seen with weight-bearing conditions. During the maximal extension, the ISP distance at the L 2 – 3 motion segment was significantly reduced, but no significant changes were detected at L 3 – 4 and L 4 – 5. During flexion the ISP distances were not significantly different than those measured in the MRI position at all segments. Going from the left to <b>right</b> <b>twist</b> positions, the L 4 – 5 segment had greater amounts of ISP rotation, while all segments had similar ranges of translation in the transverse plane. The interspinous process distances were dependent on body posture and vertebral level...|$|E
