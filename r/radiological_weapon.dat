There were incidents in post-Soviet Russia of nuclear plant workers attempting to sell nuclear materials for this purpose (for example, there was such an incident in Russia in 1999 where plant workers attempted to sell 5grams of radioactive material on the open market, and an incident in 1993 where Russian workers were caught attempting to sell 4.5 kilograms of enriched uranium.), and there are additional concerns that the transportation of nuclear waste along roadways or railways opens it up for potential theft. The United Nations has since called upon world leaders to improve security in order to prevent radioactive material falling into the hands of terrorists, and such fears have been used as justifications for centralized, permanent, and secure waste repositories and increased security along transportation routes.|$|E

50|$|It is {{feared that}} a {{terrorist}} group could detonate a dirty bomb, a type of <b>radiological</b> <b>weapon.</b> A dirty bomb is made of any radioactive source and a conventional explosive. There would be no nuclear blast and likely no fatalities, but the radioactive material is dispersed and can cause extensive fallout depending on the material used. A foot-long stick of radioactive cobalt could be taken from a food irradiation plant and combined with ten pounds of explosives to contaminate 1,000 square kilometers and make some areas uninhabitable for decades. There are other radiological weapons called radiological exposure devices where an explosive is not necessary. A <b>radiological</b> <b>weapon</b> may be very appealing to terrorist groups as it is highly successful in instilling fear and panic among a population (particularly because {{of the threat of}} radiation poisoning) and would contaminate the immediate area for some period of time, disrupting attempts to repair the damage and subsequently inflicting significant economic losses.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} recent studies have {{concluded}} that the United States is vulnerable to attack from terrorists armed {{with weapons of mass destruction}} (WMD). Depending on the circumstances, a terrorist attack with nuclear or <b>radiological</b> <b>weapons</b> could cause more destruction and casualties than one with other types of WMD. Four strategies for improving U. S. capabilities to counter nuclear or radiological terrorism are often proposed: (1) to improve intelligence capabilities to gain better knowledge of terrorist intentions and capabilities; (2) to improve security measures in nuclear facilities throughout the former Soviet Union (FSU) and elsewhere, so terrorists will have more difficulty acquiring nuclear materials; (3) to deter terrorists from conducting nuclear or radiological attacks, particularly in the United States; and (4) to improve America's response capabilities to terrorists that have already acquired nuclear or <b>radiological</b> <b>weapons.</b> This thesis evaluates current U.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. WMD terrorism {{is a new}} concern. The United States is preparing {{for the possibility of}} terrorist attacks involving chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, but the scope of these preparations is too narrow. This thesis argues that radiological devices are also viable weapons of mass destruction for terrorism. <b>Radiological</b> <b>weapons</b> are not nuclear explosives, they are designed to disperse radioactive material over an area by mechanical means or conventional explosives. The potential for radiological terrorism depends upon access to the required nuclear materials and the motivations for terrorists to use <b>radiological</b> <b>weapons.</b> Rasiological weapons can use non-lethal grade nuclear material which is widely accessible throughout the world. The materials is under a spectrum of physical security systems with little accountability and verification. <b>Radiological</b> <b>weapons</b> can further terrorist objectives because they can be used to contaminate individuals without producing the immediate and catastrophic damage normally associated with WMD. This prospect of contamination is enough to incite the public's fear of the nuclear unknown or nuclear phobia. To counter radiological terrorism, the U.

5000|$|One way to {{mitigate}} a major {{effect of a}} <b>radiological</b> <b>weapons</b> may also be {{to educate the public}} on the nature of radioactive materials.

Education on radiation is considered by some to be [...] "the most neglected issue related to radiological terrorism".|$|R
50|$|Since these bombings, no {{nuclear weapons}} have been {{deployed}} offensively. Nevertheless, they prompted an arms race to develop increasingly destructive bombs to provide a nuclear deterrent. Just over four years later, on August 29, 1949, the Soviet Union detonated its first fission weapon. The United Kingdom followed on October 2, 1952; France, on February 13, 1960; and China component to a nuclear weapon. Approximately half of the deaths from Hiroshima and Nagasaki died {{two to five years}} afterward from radiation exposure. A radiological weapons is a type of nuclear weapon designed to distribute hazardous nuclear material in enemy areas. Such a weapon would not have the explosive capability of a fission or fusion bomb, but would kill many people and contaminate a large area. A <b>radiological</b> <b>weapon</b> has never been deployed. While considered useless by a conventional military, such a weapon raises concerns over nuclear terrorism.|$|E

5000|$|A salted bomb is {{a nuclear}} weapon {{designed}} {{to function as a}} <b>radiological</b> <b>weapon,</b> producing enhanced quantities of radioactive fallout, rendering a large area uninhabitable. [...] The term is derived both from the means of their manufacture, which involves the incorporation of additional elements to a standard atomic weapon, and from the expression [...] "to salt the earth", meaning to render an area uninhabitable for generations. The idea originated with Hungarian-American physicist Leo Szilard, in February 1950. His intent was not to propose that such a weapon be built, but to show that nuclear weapon technology would soon reach the point where it could end human life on Earth. [...] No intentionally salted bomb has ever been atmospherically tested, however the UK tested a 1 kiloton bomb incorporating a small amount of cobalt as an experimental radiochemical tracer at their Tadje testing site in Maralinga range, Australia, on September 14, 1957. Furthermore the triple [...] "taiga" [...] nuclear salvo test, as part of the preliminary March 1971 Pechora-Kama Canal project, produced substantial amounts of Co-60, with this fusion generated neutron activation product being responsible for about half of the gamma dose now (2011) at the test site.|$|E

50|$|Biological {{and nuclear}} weapons fall into {{the highest level of}} WMD threat, because their effect, for a given low weight, is far greater than for {{chemical}} and <b>radiological</b> <b>weapons.</b> As a consequence, they were given a priority, comparable to that given nuclear weapons, in the analysis of Iraq's potential WMD programs. Also, see CIA transnational health and economic activities regarding naturally occurring disease and public health issues in selected countries including Russia and India.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{there is}} an {{argument}} that nuclear and biological weapons do not belong {{in the same category}} as chemical and [...] "dirty bomb" [...] <b>radiological</b> <b>weapons,</b> which have limited destructive potential (and close to none, as far as property is concerned), whereas nuclear and biological weapons have the unique ability to kill large numbers of people with very small amounts of material, and thus could be said to belong in a class by themselves.|$|R
