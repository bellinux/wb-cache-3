The camera is then {{set to the}} proper EV setting via an easily reached aperture <b>release</b> <b>tab,</b> though the EV scale itself is rather inconveniently located {{on the underside of}} the lens assembly. Once the aperture <b>release</b> <b>tab</b> is set and released, the shutter ring is coupled to the aperture ring - moving the shutter ring automatically moves the aperture ring, so that the same exposure value is maintained. In other words, when in use, the camera is normally locked into one EV setting until the aperture <b>release</b> <b>tab</b> is pressed. Needless to say this can be confusing to those unfamiliar with the camera.|$|E

5000|$|Windows may {{be divided}} into two categories, 'always-on-top' and ordinary. When a task is {{switched}} to, it is moved to the head of its category. For the following example, suppose there are no 'always-on-top' windows. Let A be the current window title. Hold down Alt and press and <b>release</b> <b>Tab</b> once, leaving Alt pressed. The window list comes up. A is guaranteed to be first in the list. Suppose the complete list is A W Z E U B C. The selection cursor will initially be on W. Suppose we want to switch to window U. Without releasing Alt, press Tab three more times and then release Alt. Then hold down Alt and press-release Tab once leaving Alt down. The window list will now show U A W Z E B C. Then Tab over to E and release Alt, selecting window E. Press and hold down Alt and press-release Tab once leaving Alt down. The window list will now show E U A W Z B C. Note that the windows switched to with [...] (E, U, A) are in order of how recently they were switched to. Now Tab over to A and release Alt. Press and hold down Alt and press-release Tab leaving Alt down. The window list will show A E U W Z B C. The effect of this most-recently used behavior is that to return to the most recent task, Tab is pressed once, for the second most recent task Tab is pressed twice, and so on for all tasks. The priority of a window in terms of [...] accessibility is how recently it was used. If A is now minimized, the list will become E U W Z B C A, and if Z is minimized the list becomes E U W B C A Z. Thus minimizing a window mimics the effect of not using it for a long time.|$|E

5000|$|The commonplace {{alternation}} {{between the}} 2 most recent tasks (using a fast [...] with all keys released immediately) is precisely {{a special case}} of the above behavior. Suppose the windows are A B C {{and we want to}} alternate between A and B. Hold Alt while pressing and releasing Tab; continue holding Alt. The list will show A B C and the cursor will initially be over B. When Alt is released B will be selected, Tab having been pressed a total of 1 time, and zero attention to the task selection cursor having been necessary. Again, press and <b>release</b> <b>Tab</b> while holding Alt. The list will show B A C and the cursor will initially be over A. When Alt is released we have switched back to A. Displaying the list again, the order has returned to A B C and this sequence can recur. On close inspection, in the course of typing [...] and releasing both keys quickly, the task list window can be observed to flicker for a split second, so [...]If the user has been switching among 3 applications and wants to dispense with one of them by minimizing, one of the remaining ones will be on top immediately after minimizing, and ordinarily [...] will alternate between the 2 remaining windows. If a program fails to move {{to the end of the}} list when minimized, pressing [...] once will return to the minimized program. Failures such as this can result in a frenzied reordering of the [...] list by means of several --... sequences to compensate for the program misbehavior. The algorithm for this reshuffling is intuitive after using for a long time.If the user attempts to switch to an application using [...] but the application fails to update its place in the z-order (for example, if its window procedure is hung), then the next time [...] is invoked, the task selection cursor may initially point unexpectedly far into the list of icons, just past the application in question, which will not have been moved to the head of the list.|$|E
40|$|Background Modulatory {{descending}} pathways, originating at supraspinal {{sites that}} converge at dorsal horn neurons, influence pain perception in humans.

50|$|In October 1980 Florence Bjelke-Petersen {{was elected}} to the Senate as a National Party member and six weeks later Joh won his fifth {{successive}} state election as premier, with the Nationals converting a 27.9 percent primary vote—their highest ever—into 35 of the parliament's 82 seats, or 43 percent of seats. It also created a record 13-seat lead over their coalition partners, the Liberals, who had campaigned by offering Queenslanders an alternative style of moderate government. The Nationals picked up all four Gold Coast seats and all those on the Sunshine Coast. Once again the premier took advantage of his party's dominance over the Liberals in Cabinet, this time demanding that the seven Liberal ministers sign a coalition agreement in which they promised unquestioned allegiance to Cabinet decisions. The move turned the Nationals' 35 votes to a guaranteed majority of 42 in the House, effectively neutralising any potential opposition by the 15 Liberal backbenchers. Bjelke-Petersen began making appointments, including judges and the chairmanship of the Totalisator Agency Board, that had traditionally been the domain of Liberal ministers, and accusations arose of political interference and conflicts of interest as mining contracts, casino licences and the rights to build shopping complexes were awarded to business figures with National Party links.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies on visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) vector control have been conducted during the past decade, sometimes came to very different conclusion. The present study on a large sample investigated different options which are partially unexplored including: (1) indoor residual spraying (IRS) with alpha cypermethrin 5 WP; (2) long lasting insecticide impregnated bed-net (LLIN); (3) impregnation of local bed-nets with slow <b>release</b> insecticide K-O <b>TAB</b> 1 - 2 - 3 (KOTAB); (4) insecticide spraying in potential breeding sites outside of house using chlorpyrifos 20 EC (OUT) and different combinations of the above. The study was a cluster randomized controlled trial where 3089 houses from 11 villages were divided into 10 sections, each section with 6 clusters and each cluster having approximately 50 houses. Based on vector density (males plus females) during baseline survey, the 60 clusters were categorized into 3 groups: (1) high, (2) medium and (3) low. Each group had 20 clusters. From these three groups, 6 clusters (about 300 households) were randomly selected {{for each type of}} intervention and control arms. Vector density was measured before and 2, 4, 5, 7, 11, 14, 15, 18 and 22 months after intervention using CDC light traps. The impact of interventions was measured by using the difference-in-differences regression model. A total of 17, 434 sand flies were collected at baseline and during the surveys conducted over 9 months following the baseline measurements. At baseline, the average P. argentipes density per household was 10. 6 (SD = 11. 5) in the control arm and 7. 3 (SD = 8. 46) to 11. 5 (SD = 20. 2) in intervention arms. The intervention results presented as the range of percent reductions of sand flies (males plus females) and rate ratios in 9 measurements over 22 months. Among single type interventions, the effect of IRS with 2 rounds of spraying (applied by the research team) ranged from 13 % to 75 % reduction of P. argentipes density compared to the control arm (rate-ratio [RR] ranged from 0. 25 to 0. 87). LLINs caused a vector reduction of 9 % to 78 % (RR, 0. 22 to 0. 91). KOTAB reduced vectors by 4 % to 73 % (RR, 0. 27 to 0. 96). The combination of LLIN and OUT led to a vector reduction of 26 % to 86 % (RR, 0. 14 to 0. 74). The reduction for the combination of IRS and OUT was 8 % to 88 % (RR, 0. 12 to 0. 92). IRS and LLIN combined resulted in a vector reduction of 13 % to 85 % (RR, 0. 15 to 0. 77). The IRS and KOTAB combination reduced vector densities by 16 % to 86 % (RR, 0. 14 to 0. 84). Some intermediate measurements for KOTAB alone and for IRS plus LLIN; and IRS plus KOTAB were not statistically significant. The bioassays on sprayed surfaces or netting materials showed favourable results (> 80 % mortality) for 22 months (IRS tested for 12 months). In the KOTAB, a gradual decline was observed after 6 months. LLIN and OUT was the best combination to reduce VL vector densities for 22 months or longer. Operationally, this is much easier to apply than IRS. A cost analysis of the preferred tools will follow. The relationship between vector density (males plus females) and leishmaniasis incidence should be investigated, and this will require estimates of the Entomological Inoculation Rate...|$|R
