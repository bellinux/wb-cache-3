The RMR may be somewhat difficult to interpret, however, as its range is based on the scales of the indicators in the model (this becomes tricky when you have multiple indicators with varying scales; e.g., two questionnaires, one on a 0-10 scale, the other on a 1-3 scale). The standardized <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> square residual removes this difficulty in interpretation, and ranges from 0 to 1, with a value of [...]08 or less being indicative of an acceptable model.|$|R
