D.), School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Washington State UniversityIn this study, work on {{developing}} {{a small scale}} internal combustion engine operating on a four-stroke principle is conducted. To mitigate the parasitic losses, a complaint engine concept is proposed in which the piston-cylinder assembly {{is replaced by a}} flexible cavity. This approach offers various advantages, such as mitigating friction and blow-by losses, fuel-flexibility, and a simpler design. The study encompasses mathematical modeling, feasibility analysis, and testing of a prototype engine. A physics-based lumped-parameter model is developed to predict the engine performance for a range of equivalence ratios at various load conditions in both open and closed cycle operations. The open and closed cycle results showed similarities. For instance, both the cycles showed that for a fixed load, increasing the heat input results in increase of stroke length and efficiency. However, the predictions from the cycles differed numerically in terms of efficiency, operating frequency etc. For example, the indicated thermal efficiencies obtained from open and closed cycles were 38. 4 % and 47. 6 %, respectively. It has been realized that when modeling the compliant engine in a more realistic way, an open cycle would be more appropriate. The open cycle results highlight some unique features of the complaint engine. For instance, the engine volume excursions are found to be dependent on the heat input or equivalence ratio and load condition. To ascertain the feasibility of a practical engine, super compliant structures fabricated from metals and, or composites that can sustain extreme pressures and temperatures are evaluated. In addition, a prototype engine is realized to practically demonstrate the compliant engine concept. The engine is motored to estimate the parasitic losses at resonant operation, and the results are presented {{in the form of an}} energy flow diagram. The results showed that friction losses associated with the flexible cavity are less than that in a piston-cylinder assembly. An example simulation based on open cycle with practical engine parameters showed that the ratio of friction work to indicated work is about 8 %; less than targeted 10 %. This result reinforces that a compliant <b>resonant</b> <b>engine</b> has the potential to outperform the contemporary engines at small scale.

40|$|Actual {{trend in}} steam turbine design {{is to use}} blades with {{integral}} shrouds, for high pressure and intermediate pressure steam turbine sections, as well as also for the long blades of the low pressure sections. The blades are inserted with their root into the seat on the shaft {{in such a way}} that the blades are slightly forced against each other in correspondence of the shrouds. In long blades of low pressure stages the forcing can be obtained by the untwisting of twisted blades due to the effect of the huge centrifugal forces. The dynamic behavior of these blade rows is difficult to predict due to the nonlinear effect of the contact forces and due to friction. Different models for the contact are proposed and compared. The resulting natural frequencies of the blade row as a function of the different nodal diameter mode shapes are highly depending on the assumed models. For avoiding <b>resonant</b> conditions with <b>engine</b> order excitations, the natural frequencies must be calculated with good accuracy. Some of the modes of the blade row, typically for the last stage of the low pressure steam turbine, can couple with some vibration modes of the rotor: flexural vibrations of the shaft couple with 1 nodal diameter mode shape of the row in axial direction and torsional vibrations of the shaft couple with the 0 nodal diameter mode in tangential direction. Therefore analyses of lateral and torsional vibrations of low pressure steam turbine shafts require also an accurate analysis of the blade row vibration modes...|$|R
