40|$|Purpose. The study investigates: 1) long cargo movements, {{carried on}} {{coupling}} of two railway platforms equipped with turnstile-fastening devices (TFD); 2) the forces {{acting on the}} cargo by the TFD. Methodologhy. Research were carried out using oscillations theory of mechanical systems with {{a finite number of}} degrees of freedom. Findings. Authors obtained rational parameters of TFD at dry friction in supports, which provide the smallest forces acting on the cargo as a result of impact. Oringinality. Early studies of «car – cargo» system dynamics with moving TFD were carried out with insufficient accuracy. When considering such tasks one resorted to a significant simplification of the calculation schemes. The use of such devices allows producing supports of long cargo for cars movable-centered ones. TED allow more or less significant shift of the cargo relatively to support cars in the longitudinal direction. After impact the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> in the original position is ensured. Restoring force in such devices is formed either by the elastic properties of TED, either by increasing the center level relying on them masses. The return process takes place by the kinematic way when horizontal deflection of TFD from the equilibrium position. The solution of the problem to determine the nature and magnitudes acting on the cargo forces and accelerations is implemented by mathematical model, adequate to real conditions. Gaps limitations and absorbing apparatuses of the cars in TFD are taken into account. Practical value. This study will allow to calculate the parameters of real TFD that will reduce the damage of long cargo transported on coupling of railway platforms...|$|E

50|$|During {{the eighteenth}} century, <b>the</b> pursuit <b>of</b> criminals, {{involved}} common {{people to a}} lesser extent due to a series <b>of</b> factors. At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventeenth century population in London was incredibly growing and the city borders expanding thanks to the favorable economic situation that attracted a great number of immigrants escaping from poor life conditions. In such circumstances it was arduous to spot and find guilty suspects in the capital; and victims were afraid of organized criminals and their violent reprisal. In addition, defendants hardly suffered <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> their actions in trials, and felonies were for the most part not even identified. Property was <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biggest concern to inhabitants and public administration, hence theft of any kind was considered a serious crime, along with coining. In <b>the</b> Proceedings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Bailey, theft, except robbery (violent theft), emerges as <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> crime tried <b>the</b> most at the Old Bailey. Prosecuting was expensive and took considerable time, yet it did not ensure <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stolen <b>goods</b> to <b>the</b> victim. Consequently, victims started to pay private individuals to conduct investigation and provide evidence for conviction. Likewise public authorities begun to offer rewards to people actively involved in <b>the</b> conviction <b>of</b> felons or <b>the</b> betrayal accomplices.
