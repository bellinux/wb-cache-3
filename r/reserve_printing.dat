The most direct method evaluates the spectrum using the fields {{given by the}} Liénard-Wiechart potentials. However, for relativistic particles this procedure is computationally expensive.

The algorithm is suitable for evaluating spectra both from particles moving in a specific realization of a turbulent electromagnetic field or from trajectories given as a finite, discrete time series by a PIC simulation. The main advantage of the method is that it identifies the intrinsic spectral features and filters out those that are artifacts of the limited time resolution and finite duration of input trajectories. © 2010.

We first formalize three prominent hypotheses on why people marry: marriage provides an exogenous payoff to married partners, it serves as a commitment device, and it serves as a signaling device. For each theory we analyze how a reduction in the costs of divorce affects the propensity to divorce for couples at any given duration of marriage. We then use individual marriage and divorce certificate data from the United States to bring these alternative views of the marriage contract to bear on the data. We exploit variations in the timing of the adoption of unilateral divorce laws across states to proxy a one-off and permanent reduction in divorce costs. The results suggest that the dominant reason that couples enter into a marriage contract is that it serves as a commitment device. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago.

All rights <b>reserved.</b> <b>Printed</b> in the U. S. A. Interstellar bubbles {{appear to}} be smaller in {{observations}} than expected from calculations. Instabilities at the shell boundaries create three-dimensional (3 D) effects and are probably responsible for part of this discrepancy. We investigate instabilities and dynamics in superbubbles using 3 D hydrodynamics simulations with time-resolved energy input from massive stars, including supernova explosions. We find that the superbubble shells are accelerated by supernova explosions, coincident with substantial brightening in soft X-ray emission. In between the explosions, the superbubbles lose energy efficiently, approaching the momentum-conserving snowplow limit. This and enhanced radiative losses due to instabilities reduce the expansion compared to the corresponding radiative bubbles in pressure-driven snowplow models with constant energy input. We note generally good agreement with observations of superbubbles and some open issues. In particular, there are hints that the shell velocities in the X-ray-bright phases are underpredicted...|$|R
