5|$|As a {{security}} measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured {{a replica of}} the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on subsequent occasions up until 1970 when the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica also had to disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was eventually sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, ten times the <b>reserve</b> <b>price</b> of £20,000–£30,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Subsequent testing by FIFA, however, confirmed the auctioned trophy was indeed a replica and FIFA soon afterwards arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.|$|E

The psychological effect has recently been introduced in behavioral models of situations where agents are uncertain about their own willingness-to-pay, while the mechanical effect is well captured by standard auction theory.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a situation of}} two sellers of perfectly substitutable items competing in publicly announced <b>reserve</b> <b>prices</b> to induce potential bidders participation at their auction. After learning their own valuations and upon observing the <b>reserve</b> <b>prices,</b> potential bidders make a participation decision consisting of a unique auction to visit. The participation decision is modelled as a standard Bayesian- Nash game. Once participation decisions are realized, each bidder observes the aggregate number of bidders at the auction, and bidding games unfold. For extreme parameter values {{of the distribution of}} potential-bidders' valuation, it is shown that a unique, symmetric, pure-strategy equilibrium in <b>reserve</b> <b>prices</b> exists. For other values however, no equilibrium in pure strategy exists. The results share the non-existence feature of Hotelling location type models. The model also contributes to the recent literature on directed search. Auctions, <b>Reserve</b> <b>Prices,</b> Competition, Private Information and Directed Search. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. A {{working paper}} {{entitled}} "Oil and Natural Gas <b>Reserve</b> <b>Prices</b> 1982 - 2002 : Implications for Depletion and Investment Cost" {{was published in}} October 2003 (cited hereafter as Adelman & Watkins [2003]). Since then we have obtained data for 2003 and estimated {{oil and natural gas}} <b>reserve</b> <b>prices</b> for that year. We have also revised our previous estimates of <b>reserve</b> <b>prices</b> for 2001. This addendum paper reports on the nature and significance of the results for 2003 and the revisions to 2001. We have also extended the analysis by adding two new features. First is the expression of <b>reserve</b> <b>prices</b> in real terms [...] previously we had only reported nominal prices. Second, we have estimated levelized or constant field prices that appear to underlie <b>reserve</b> <b>prices,</b> for each year. We refer to these as planning prices. Previously we had only published estimated growth rates in field prices from levels prevailing for a given year, congruent with our estimates of <b>reserve</b> <b>prices.</b> Section 1 of this Addendum paper highlights the 2003 results. Section 2 discusses the revisions for year 2001. Section 3 outlines the nature of the analytical extensions, presents the results, and discusses what they show. Concluding remarks are in Section 4. Adelman & Watkins [2003] included an extensive set of tables in Appendices. The revisions to all these tables to include 2003 and revised 2001 data are attached here as Appendices. This paper is to be read in conjunction with, not as a substitute for, Adelman & Watkins [2003]: analysis and description in the 2003 paper is not repeated here...|$|R

Truthful bidding is a dominant strategy with private values and an ex post equilibrium with interdependent values.

We also identify a connection between lazy reserves VCG auctions and lookahead auctions in general downward closed settings.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} necessary conditions for auction activities is efficiency. We consider a first-price sequential auction with <b>reserve</b> <b>prices</b> satisfying ex-post efficiency condition. The auction items are homogenous and the private values of auctioneers are independent and identical distributed.

Given <b>reserve</b> <b>prices</b> in an efficient first-price auction, we illustrate there exists a symmetric, monotone, pure-strategy bidding strategy in equilibrium. In addition, as the auction goes, the seller’s expected returns are decreasing and the probabilities of unsold are increasing. While conditional on the items are sold, the expected prices are increasing, since although private values of the bidders in later rounds are lesser, the bidders are more aggressive because fewer goods are available.
