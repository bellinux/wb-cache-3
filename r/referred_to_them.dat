5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the {{individually}} named rivers became known collectively as Bow Back Rivers. Charles Tween, writing {{on behalf of}} the Lee Conservancy, <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as both the Stratford Back Rivers and the Stratford Back Streams in 1905. The section {{to the west of the}} more recent City Mills Lock was labelled Bow Back River on a map of 1895, but had previously been part of Pudding Mill River. Powell, writing in 1973, still <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as the Stratford Back Rivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of psoriasis as an autoimmune disease has sparked considerable debate.

5|$|In April 2010, the BBC {{announced}} , four interactive episodes available free-to-download on the BBC Doctor Who website {{featuring the}} Doctor and Amy voiced by Smith and Gillan. Piers Wenger <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as four extra episodes {{in the series}} and everything included {{was part of the}} Doctor Who universe. The game was developed by Charles Cecil and Sheffield-based game company Sumo, while the games were written by Phil Ford and James Moran and overseen by Moffat and the producers of the show. Cecil was contacted by BBC Wales Editor of Interactive Iain Tweedale, who asked him about developing a Doctor Who game. Smith and Gillan's movements and actions were captured by rotoscoping.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} a [...] "mass noun" [...] is a {{grammatical}} concept and {{is not based on}} the innate nature of the object to which that noun refers. For example, [...] "seven chairs" [...] and [...] "some furniture" [...] could <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> exactly the same objects, with [...] "seven chairs" [...] <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as a collection of individual objects but with [...] "some furniture" [...] <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as a single undifferentiated unit. However, some abstract phenomena like [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "hope" [...] have properties which make it difficult <b>to</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> with a count noun.|$|R
5|$|Sirenia is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, {{including}} manatees and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) {{in the form of}} two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarians were {{mentioned}} under various ethnic names in Arabic, Byzantine, Slavic, and Western European {{sources in the}} 9th and 10th centuries. Arabic scholars <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as Magyars, Bashkirs, or Turks; Byzantine authors mentioned them as Huns, Ungrs, Turks, or Savards; Slavic sources used the ethnonyms Ugr or Peon, and Western European authors wrote of Hungrs, Pannons, Avars, Huns, Turks, and Agaren. According to the linguist Gyula Németh, the multiple ethnonymsespecially Ungr, Savard, and Turkreflect that the Magyars had been integrated in various empires of the Eurasian steppesthe tribal confederations of the Onogurs and of the Sabirs, and the Turkic Khaganatebefore gaining their independence.|$|E
5|$|Canis dirus {{lived in}} the late Pleistocene to the early Holocene (125,000–10,000 years before present or YBP) in North and South America (although no members of Canis survive in the latter continent). The {{majority}} of fossils from the eastern C.d.dirus have been dated 125,000–75,000YBP, but the western C.d.guildayi fossils are not only smaller in size but more recent; thus it has been proposed that C.d.guildayi derived from C.d.dirus. However, there are disputed specimens of C.dirus that date to 250,000YBP. Fossil specimens of C.dirus discovered at four sites in the Hay Springs area of Sheridan County, Nebraska, were named Aenocyon dirus nebrascensis (Frick 1930, undescribed), but Frick did not publish {{a description of the}}m. Nowak later referred to this material as C.armbrusteri; then, in 2009, Tedford formally published a description of the specimens and noted that, although they exhibited some morphological characteristics of both C.armbrusteri and C.dirus, he <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> only as C.dirus. These Nebraskan fossil specimens may represent the earliest record of C.dirus.|$|E

5|$|In November 2010, the PTC {{released}} a study, Habitat for Profanity: Broadcast TV's Sharp Increase in Foul Language, which claims {{that there was}} a sharp rise in the usage of profanity between 2005 and 2010—during the 8PM to 9PM ET/PT time period commonly <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as the Family Viewing Hour, the PTC claimed that there were 111 instances of profanity during this hour in 2010 versus 10 in 2005; during all of prime time, 276 instances in 2010 against 11 in 2005. The study claimed {{that there was a}} 69.3% increase in prime time in general between 2005 and 2010, with the Fox network being heavily accused of bringing a 269% increase for the network during that period. The study also claimed instances in which there was profanity, but the offending word was bleeped out.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli was {{primarily}} a teacher of scripture rather than a systematic theologian, but his lasting influence is mostly associated with his doctrine of the Eucharist. This {{can be explained by}} the close relationship he saw between exegesis of scripture and theological reflection. Vermigli's method of biblical commentary, similar to that of Martin Bucer, was to include extended discussions of doctrinal topics treated by the biblical texts. Like other Protestants, he believed scripture alone held supreme authority in establishing truth. Nevertheless, he was familiar with the church fathers to a higher degree than many of his contemporaries, and he constantly <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> He saw value in the fathers because they had discovered insights into the scriptures that he might not have found, and because many of his Catholic opponents placed great weight on arguments from patristic authority. Often, though, he used the fathers as support for interpretations he had already reached on his own and was not concerned when his interpretation had no patristic precedent.|$|E
5|$|The (as McKay {{liked to}} point out, undefeated) team made their game debut against the Los Angeles Rams in an {{exhibition}} at the Los Angeles Coliseum on July 31, losing 26-3. McKay called the players’ performance “unaggressive, uninspiring, lethargic, and unacceptable”, and cut 15 players one day prior to the following Tuesday’s cutdown date. McKay {{was pleased with the}} following week’s improved performance against the Green Bay Packers, a 10–6 loss in which a late interception of a Parnell Dickinson pass prevented a likely Buccaneer victory. After the Packers <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as the “Tampa Buccaneers”, the Buccaneers threatened to introduce the “Green Packers” at their next meeting. The Buccaneers’ first victory came in a 17–3 preseason win over the favored Atlanta Falcons, in which they scored on runs by Steve Spurrier and Essex Johnson, and a Mirro Roder field goal. Although the win had no official significance, it raised optimism among fans, particularly due to the team’s defensive performance. McKay himself was puzzled, unsure whether the win was due to a superior performance by Tampa Bay, or a lack of effort by the Falcons. Their home debut came in a 28–21 loss to the Miami Dolphins, in front of a crowd of 71,718, a crowd which Dolphins owner Joe Robbie said proved his longtime prediction that a Bay Area team would be a success.|$|E
