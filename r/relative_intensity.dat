5|$|Berkelium(III) ions shows two sharp {{fluorescence}} peaks at 652nanometers (red light) and 742nanometers (deep red – near infrared) due {{to internal}} transitions at the f-electron shell. The <b>relative</b> <b>intensity</b> of these peaks {{depends on the}} excitation power and temperature of the sample. This emission can be observed, for example, after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass, by melting the glass in presence of berkelium oxide or halide.|$|E
5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The {{first step is to}} merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the <b>relative</b> <b>intensity</b> of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E

25|$|Spectral skewing is {{the change}} in <b>relative</b> <b>intensity</b> of mass {{spectral}} peaks due to the changes in concentration of the analyte in the ion source as the mass spectrum is scanned. This situation occurs routinely as chromatographic components elute into a continuous ion source. Spectral skewing is not observed in ion trap (quadrupole (this has been seen also in QMS) or magnetic) or time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzers because potentially all ions formed in operational cycle (a snapshot in time) of the instrument are available for detection.|$|E

Around the visible spectrum, the <b>relative</b> <b>intensity</b> per unit frequency is approximately {{proportional to the}} frequency. That is, higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) are more intense in Cherenkov radiation. This is why visible Cherenkov radiation is observed to be brilliant blue.

25|$|The {{spectrum}} of light emitted from a fluorescent lamp {{is the combination}} of light directly emitted by the mercury vapor, and light emitted by the phosphorescent coating. The spectral lines from the mercury emission and the phosphorescence effect give a combined spectral distribution of light {{that is different from}} those produced by incandescent sources. The <b>relative</b> <b>intensity</b> of light emitted in each narrow band of wavelengths over the visible spectrum is in different proportions compared to that of an incandescent source. Colored objects are perceived differently under light sources with differing spectral distributions. For example, some people find the color rendition produced by some fluorescent lamps to be harsh and displeasing. A healthy person can sometimes appear to have an unhealthy skin tone under fluorescent lighting. The extent to which this phenomenon occurs is related to the light's spectral composition, and may be gauged by its color rendering index (CRI).|$|E
2500|$|In {{video or}} cinematography, {{temporal}} aliasing {{results from the}} limited frame rate, and causes the wagon-wheel effect, whereby a spoked wheel appears to rotate too slowly or even backwards. Aliasing has changed its apparent frequency of rotation. A reversal of direction {{can be described as}} a negative frequency. [...] Temporal aliasing frequencies in video and cinematography are determined by the frame rate of the camera, but the <b>relative</b> <b>intensity</b> of the aliased frequencies is determined by the shutter timing (exposure time) or the use of a temporal aliasing reduction filter during filming.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{detection}} side {{there are many}} factors that can also affect signal intensity in a non-proportional way. The size of the ion will affect the velocity of impact and with certain detectors the velocity {{is proportional to the}} signal output. In other detection systems, such as FTICR, the number of charges on the ion are more important to signal intensity. In Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance and Orbitrap type mass spectrometers the signal intensity (Y-axis) is related to the amplitude of the free induction decay signal. This is fundamentally a power relationship (amplitude squared) but often computed as an [...] For decaying signals the rms is not equal to the average amplitude. Additionally the damping constant (decay rate of the signal in the fid) is not the same for all ions. In order to make conclusions about <b>relative</b> <b>intensity</b> a great deal of knowledge and care is required.|$|E
40|$|The {{absolute}} and <b>relative</b> <b>intensities</b> of thirteen {{lines of the}} helium spectrum, extending through the visible region, have been measured by a modification of the method developed by Ornstein and Dorgelo.

60|$|It must, however, {{be remembered}} that the British people are {{more than any other}} people in the world a {{manufacturing}} people. It is certain that our population could never have attained its present vast numbers, nor our country have achieved its position in the world, without an altogether unusual reliance upon manufacture as opposed to simple agriculture. The ordinary changes and transitions inseparable from the active life and growth of modern industry, therefore, operate here with greater <b>relative</b> <b>intensity</b> than in other countries. An industrial disturbance is more serious in Great Britain than in other countries, for it affects a far larger proportion of the people, and in their distresses the urban democracy are not sustained by the same solid backing of country-folk and peasant cultivators that we see in other lands. It has, therefore, become a paramount necessity for us to make scientific provision against the fluctuations and set-backs which are inevitable in world commerce and in national industry.|$|E
60|$|It is true {{that there}} are, here and there, in the Academy pictures, {{passages}} in which Turner has translated the unattainable intensity of one tone of color, into the attainable pitch of a higher one: the golden green for instance, of intense sunshine on verdure, into pure yellow, because he knows it to be impossible, with any mixture of blue whatsoever, to give faithfully its <b>relative</b> <b>intensity</b> of light, and Turner always will have his light and shade right, whatever it costs him in color. But he does this in rare cases, and even then over very small spaces; and I should be obliged to his critics if they would go out to some warm, mossy green bank in full summer sunshine, and try to reach its tone; and when they find, as find they will, Indian yellow and chrome look dark beside it, let them tell me candidly which is nearest truth, the gold of Turner, or the mourning and murky olive browns and verdigris greens in which Claude, with the industry and intelligence of a Sevres china painter, drags the laborious bramble leaves over his childish foreground.|$|E
