50|$|The two {{daunting}} {{problems that}} needed to be solved were the high demand on time stability at playback and overcoming the bandwidth constraints of the hitherto existing magnetic recording technology. The demand for high bandwidth in recording was achieved with an assembly of four <b>heads</b> <b>rotating</b> very fast transverse to the tape. This rendered possible a very high head to tape speed with a slow tape run. By this means the bandwidth could be extended three orders of magnitude: from 18 kHz with customary stationary heads up to 20 MHz with <b>rotating</b> <b>heads.</b> In connection with this, a fast switching from one head to the next had to be solved. This principle of <b>rotating</b> <b>heads</b> was and is {{at the time of this}} writing employed by all professional and later by all home video tape recorders.|$|R

This was obtained through a <b>rotating</b> magnetic <b>head</b> called the Springer temporal regulator, an ancestor of the <b>rotating</b> <b>heads</b> used in video machines.|$|R

50|$|Rotary {{transformers}} {{are most}} commonly used in videocassette recorders. Signals must be coupled from the electronics of the VCR to the fast-moving tape heads carried on the <b>rotating</b> <b>head</b> drum; a rotary transformer is ideal for this purpose. Most VCR designs require more than one signal to be coupled to the head drum. In this case, the cup core {{has more than one}} concentric winding, isolated by individual raised portions of the core. The transformer for the head drum shown to the right couples six individual channels.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of VHS, a linear control track at the tape's lower edge holds pulses that mark the {{beginning}} of every frame of video; these are used to fine-tune the tape speed during playback and to get the <b>rotating</b> <b>heads</b> exactly on their helical tracks rather than having them end up somewhere between two adjacent tracks. However, the exact distance between the <b>rotating</b> video <b>head</b> and the fixed head reading the linear track can vary by a couple of micrometers between machines due to manufacturing tolerances, so most machines offer a manual or automatic tracking control to correct such mismatches.|$|R

40|$|The aim {{of study}} was to {{investigate}} whether subjects with high (highs) and low (lows) scores of hypnotizability differ in the cortical representation of visual and kinaesthetic mental images of <b>rotated</b> <b>head</b> posture and in the relation between these representations and that associated with the perception of physically <b>rotated</b> <b>head</b> posture. Subjective reports of the vividness of visual imagery and relative cognitive effort and the power of EEG spectral frequencies (alpha, theta, beta gamma) were studied in 21 highs and 20 lows recruited among 200 participants who accepted to have their hypnotizability assessed through the Italian version of the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, form A. The findings of the present study show that a) highs report higher vividness of mental images than lows and the same effort; b) in general highs and lows show scarce differences in the representation of the two imagery modalities; the highs’ beta 3 power was modulated during kinaesthetic imagery and the lows’ beta 3 was influenced by the visual imagery; c) hypnotizability and gender interact in the modulation of alpha 1 (medioposterior, occipital), alpha 2 (occipital), theta 2 (occipital) and gamma (occipital) independently of the specific tasks. In conclusion, although findings should be considered preliminary, they are in line with the hypothesis that imagery and perception may have hypnotizability-related cortical representation, but do not provide sufficient evidence for a different degree of their superimposition to the representation of the physically <b>rotated</b> <b>head</b> in highs and lows. Investigation of EEG dynamics is likely to better capture similarities and differences and is in progress...|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of moisture between {{the tape and}} the <b>rotating</b> <b>head</b> drum increases friction which prevents correct operation and can cause damage to both the recording device and the tape. In extreme cases, if the dew sensor fails to function and stop the video recorder, moisture can cause the tape {{to stick to the}} spinning video head. This can pull a large amount of tape from the cassette before the head drum stops spinning. The tape will be extensively damaged, the video heads will often become clogged, and the mechanism may be unable to eject the cassette.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{the first}} boring machine {{to have been}} built was used in 1853 during the {{construction}} of the Hoosac Tunnel. Made of cast iron, it was known as Wilson's Patented Stone-Cutting Machine, after inventor Charles Wilson. It drilled 10 feet into the rock before breaking down. (The tunnel was eventually completed more than 20 years later, and as with the Fréjus Rail Tunnel, by using less ambitious methods.) Wilson's machine anticipated modern TBMs {{in the sense that it}} employed cutting discs, like those of a disc harrow, which were attached to the <b>rotating</b> <b>head</b> of the machine. In contrast to traditional chiseling or drilling and blasting, this innovative method of removing rock relied on simple metal wheels to apply a transient high pressure that fractured the rock.|$|E
50|$|Helical {{scanning}} was {{a logical}} progression beyond an earlier system (pioneered by Ampex) known as quadruplex recording, {{also referred to}} as transverse recording. In this scheme, the <b>rotating</b> <b>head</b> drum runs essentially perpendicular to a 2 in tape, and the slices recorded across the tape are nearly perpendicular to the tape's motion. U.S. quadruplex systems revolve the head drum at 14,400 revolutions per minute (240 revolutions per second) with four heads on the drum so that each television field is broken into 16 stripes on the tape (which requires appropriately complex head-switching logic). By comparison, the longer stripe recorded by a helical-scan recorder usually contains an entire video field and the two-headed drum spins at the frame rate (half the field rate) of the TV system in use.|$|E

50|$|Stationary turret {{system has}} a {{relatively}} higher speed {{due to a}} series of identical <b>heads</b> <b>rotating</b> on a single turret. The feeder moves in the X direction to a fixed pickup location. As many as 36 vacuum nozzles {{around the perimeter of the}} rotating turret provide Z and theta alignment. Turret <b>rotates</b> multiple <b>heads</b> between pickup and placement locations. The PCB moves in X and Y direction under the <b>rotating</b> <b>heads,</b> pausing beneath the correct placement location. Comparing to a gantry head, the simultaneous movements of feeders and PCBs greatly improve the average placement rate. Because passive components do not demand a great placement accuracy, it is exclusively applied in chip shooters. Stationary turret system has a limitation of requiring large footprint for the moving feeder bank (footprint =2*total feeder length). The possibility of dislodging components due to the moving board mechanism is another limitation.|$|R

50|$|The {{de-icing}} bogies carried ice-cutters, {{which were}} held {{against the current}} rail by a compressed air cylinder. Each had a <b>rotating</b> <b>head</b> with ridged steel rollers, {{to break up the}} ice. Sleet brushes with metal prongs were mounted either side of the cutter, so that the rail was swept before and after cutting, whichever way the locomotive was moving. Anti-freeze was applied to the rail by spray nozzles, supplied from a tank mounted in the central section, and accessible through a sliding door. Two operators were required, one to drive and the other to operate valves, so that when the current rail changed sides, the application of anti-freeze followed. In 1955, the process was upgraded, and the detection of the current rail was made automatic. When there was no rail, the sprays shut down, as they also did when the locomotive stopped.|$|E
50|$|There were {{a number}} of {{problems}} to be overcome with this system. The high tape/head speed could lead to rapid wear of both the tape and the head, so both need to be highly polished, and the head made of a hard, wear-resistant material. Most systems operate with an air bearing separating the heads {{from the surface of the}} drum. Supplying signals to a <b>rotating</b> <b>head</b> is also problematic: This is usually accomplished by coupling the signal(s) inductively through a rotary transformer. The transport mechanism is also much more complex than a fixed head system, since during loading, the tape must be pulled around a rotating drum containing the head(s). In a VCR for example, the tape must be pulled out of the cassette case and threaded around the drum, and between the capstan and pinch roller. This leads to complex and potentially unreliable mechanics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rotating</b> play <b>heads,</b> as used {{in video}} recorders, digital audio tape and other applications, are used to achieve a high {{relative}} head/tape speed while maintaining a low overall tape transport speed. One or more transducers are mounted on a rotating drum set {{at an angle to}} the tape. The drum spins rapidly compared to the speed that the tape moves past it, so that the transducers describe a path of stripes across the tape, rather than linearly along it as a fixed head does. The wear characteristics of such helical scan heads are even more critical, and highly polished heads and tapes are required. The electrical signals of <b>rotating</b> <b>heads</b> are coupled either inductively or capacitively - there is no direct connection to the head coils.|$|R
