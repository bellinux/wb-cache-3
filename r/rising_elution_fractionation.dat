50|$|Molar mass {{determination}} of copolymers {{is a much}} more complicated procedure. The complications arise from the effect of solvent on the homopolymers and how this can affect the copolymer morphology. Analysis of copolymers typically requires multiple characterization methods. For instance, copolymers with short chain branching such as linear low-density polyethylene (a copolymer of ethylene and a higher alkene such as hexene or octene) require the use of Analytical Temperature <b>Rising</b> <b>Elution</b> <b>Fractionation</b> (ATREF) techniques. These techniques can reveal how the short chain branches are distributed over the various molecular weights. A more efficient analysis of copolymer molecular mass and composition is possible using GPC combined with a triple-detection system comprising multi-angle light scattering, UV absorption and differential refractometry, if the copolymer is composed of two base polymers that provide different responses to UV and/or refractive index.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Olefin block {{copolymers}} {{produced by}} chain shuttling catalysis exhibit crystallinity characteristics that are distinct from {{what would be}} expected for typical random olefin copolymers with comparable monomer compositions produced from either ‘single-site ’ or heterogeneous catalysis. Olefin block copolymers produced by chain shuttling catalysis have a statistical multiblock architecture. A unique structural feature of olefin-based block copolymers is that the intra-chain distribution of comonomer is segmented (statistically non-random). Fractionating an olefin block copolymer by preparative temperature <b>rising</b> <b>elution</b> <b>fractionation,</b> TREF, results in fractions that have much higher comonomer content than comparable fractions of a random copolymer collected at an equivalent TREF elution temperature. We have developed a ‘‘block index’ ’ methodology which quantifies the deviation from the expected monomer composition versus the analytical temperature <b>rising</b> <b>elution</b> <b>fractionation,</b> ATREF, elution temperature. When interpreted properly, this index indicates {{the degree to which}} the intra-chain comonomer distribution is segmented or blocked. The unique crystallization behavior of block copolymers determine the magnitude of the block index values because the highly crystalline segments along an otherwise non-crystalline chain tend to dominate the ATREF (and DSC) temperature distributions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: An ethylene-hexene copolymer, {{representative}} of many heterogeneous linear low-density polyethylenes (LLDPEs), {{has been shown}} to contain a dispersed minority phase (volume fraction 10 - 2), which was manifested by departures from a Q- 2 variation of the neutron scattering cross section at low Q values. After xylene extraction, which removes the highly branched amorphous material, the dispersed phase is removed to a good approximation. In contrast, a metallocene-based LLDPE, which has a more homogeneous distribution of branch contents, does not exhibit an upturn in the cross section in the limit of low momentum transfer (Q < 10 - 2 Å- 1), indicating that the LLDPE forms only a single phase in the melt. The composition variance is calculated from the comonomer composition distribution obtained by temperature-rising <b>elution</b> <b>fractionation</b> (TREF) and used to estimate proximity of the melts to the spinodal condition.

40|$|A simple {{technique}} employing {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) {{to investigate}} the molecular structure of ethylene copolymers is presented in this paper. Three commercial Ziegler-Natta catalysed linear low density polyethylenes (LLDPE) and a commercial single-site catalysed very low density polyethylene (VLDPE) were subjected to continuous cooling at a slow rate of 0. 08 degreesC min(- 1). Like other thermal fractionation techniques, the slow continuous cooling (SCC) technique segregates polymers according to their branching density, allowing the short chain branching (SCB), lamellar thickness (L) and methylene sequence length (MSL) distribution to be determined using the DSC melting curves. It {{was found that the}} single-site catalysed VLDPE exhibits narrow SCB, L and MSL distributions, with shorter methylene sequences. In contrast, the Ziegler-Natta catalysed LLDPEs have much broader bimodal SCB, L and MSL distributions, with less SCB, and are composed of both short and long methylene sequences. LLDPEs have thicker lamellae compared with VLDPE (12. 9, 12. 5, 9. 8 nm versus 6. 7 nm) and the lamellar thickness values are consistent with the results measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The slow continuous cooling and stepwise cooling techniques are complementary: the former provides a continuous distribution profile and the latter a well-defined histogram for the lamellar thickness.

In our dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of lattice chains, the current model further {{assumes that the}} comonomers cannot move into crystalline regions by sliding diffusion of the chains. We find that both the overall composition and the statistical distribution of the monomers affect the phase-transition temperature, the resulting relative crystallinity, and the crystal morphology. However, the final absolute crystallinity of homogeneous copolymers seems insensitive to these parameters. Intramolecular segregation between monomers and comonomers is accompanied by crystallization, demonstrating the concept of sequence segregation or nanophase separation of statistical copolymers with assembling structures like in thermoplastic elastomers. Moreover, if crystallization of homogeneous copolymers has started but not yet completed on cooling, subsequent heating will show cold crystallization before melting, which {{can be attributed to}} insertion-mode lamellar growth. For heterogeneous copolymers, intermolecular segregation occurs on cooling before crystallization.

One consequence of the development of new “tailor-made” polyolefins is the need for new and improved analytical techniques for the analysis of polyolefins with respect to molar mass, molecular topology and chemical composition distribution. This review presents different new and relevant techniques for polyolefin analysis. The analysis of copolymers by combining high-temperature SEC and FTIR spectroscopy yields information on chemical composition and molecular topology as a function of molar mass. Crystallization based fractionation techniques are powerful methods for the analysis of short-chain branching in LLDPE and the analysis of polyolefin blends. These methods include temperature-rising <b>elution</b> <b>fractionation,</b> crystallization analysis fractionation and the recently developed crystallization-elution fractionation. The latest development in the field of polyolefin fractionation is high-temperature interaction chromatography.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Preparative {{fractionation}} {{techniques are}} currently used {{in order to}} obtain large amounts of polyethylene fractions. Preparative successive solution fractionation (SSF) and temperature <b>rising</b> <b>elution</b> <b>fractionation</b> (TREF) are compared as regards obtaining, at a multi-gram scale, low-dispersity fractions of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The operative separation mechanisms during a SSF of a broad HDPE, which are not yet totally elucidated, are also studied in this work. RESULTS: SSF and TREF approaches lead to the separation of HDPE macromolecules according to their molar masses. If very homogeneous fractions (dispersities from 1. 1 to 1. 3) are isolated in TREF at the lowest elution temperature, the collected mass is too low. At higher elution temperatures, the fractions have too broad a molar mass distribution (dispersities from 2. 7 to 3. 7). With the SSF procedure, dispersities are not as low as for the first TREF fractions. But, the relative weight fraction is better distributed between the different extraction temperatures. The molar mass distribution exhibits a dispersity of around 1. 9. CONCLUSION: The SSF method is the most suitable way to obtain large gram amounts of low-dispersity (ca 2) HDPE fractions over a wide molar mass range. Complementary gram-scale rheological characterization is thus possible enabling a better comprehension of the SSF mechanism. Liquid-liquid demixing is the main mechanism in SSF, but its relative importance depends on polymer characteristics and solvent quality. (C) 2008 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E

The TREF fractions were subsequently analysed offline by crystallisation analysis fractionation (CRYSTAF), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 13 C NMR, high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography (HT-GPC), and wide-angle x-ray diffraction (WAXD). The effect of the ethylene comonomer on the crystallisability of the propylene was investigated, along with the effect of the comonomer on the type of crystal phase formed during the crystallisation. The results show that the comonomer inhibits the crystallisation of the copolymer and that as the ethylene content increases, the crystallisation and melting points decrease. It was also shown that the higher the ethylene content, the more of the γ-phase crystal type is formed. The distribution of the comonomer throughout the copolymers was also investigated. The results show that there is an uneven distribution of the comonomer with most of the comonomer accumulating in the amorphous areas, and very little actually being incorporated in the crystalline regions. It was also observed that the fractions eluting at the highest temperatures had considerably higher polydispersities and lower molecular weights than the fractions eluting just before them. The highest temperature fractions also have lower melting and crystallisation temperatures than the preceding fractions. This has been attributed to a nucleation effect by the sand support used during the TREF fractionation...|$|E

In a typical CEF experiment, a polymer solution is loaded in the CEF column at high temperature, the polymer is allowed to crystallize by lowering the solution temperature, and then the precipitated polymer is eluted by a solvent flowing through the column as the temperature is raised. CEF needs to be calibrated to provide quantitative CCD results. A CEF calibration curve consists of a mathematical relationship between elution temperature determined by CEF and comonomer fraction in the copolymer that could be estimated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and carbon- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13 C NMR). Different comonomer types in ethylene/α-olefin copolymers will have distinct calibration curves. The main objective of this thesis is to obtain CEF calibration curves for several different ethylene/α-olefin copolymers and to investigate which factors influence these calibration curves. A series of homogeneous ethylene/α-olefin copolymers (1 -hexene, 1 -octene and 1 -dodecene) with different comonomer fractions were synthesized under controlled conditions to create CEF calibration standards. Their average chemical compositions were determined by 13 C NMR and FTIR and then used to establish CEF calibration curves relating elution temperature and comonomer molar fraction in the copolymer...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} propylene polymerization using a 4 th generation Ziegler-Natta catalyst {{is presented in}} this thesis. The apparent kinetic rate constants for propylene polymerization were estimated in the presence and absence of hydrogen and/or donor. The estimated activation energies for activation, propagation, and deactivation {{were found to be}} close to values previously reported in the literature for similar catalysts. The polypropylene samples were characterized using high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC), carbon- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13 C NMR), and crystallization <b>elution</b> <b>fractionation</b> (CEF). The effect of hydrogen and external electron donor on polypropylene microstructure was investigated at two polymerization temperatures. In addition to the expected electron donor positive effect on tacticity, hydrogen was also found to increase polypropylene tacticity. The effect of changing these polymerization conditions on molecular weight and polydispersity was also investigated. Finally, CEF profiles show how the distribution of polypropylene crystallizability changes by adding hydrogen and electron donor to the reactor. The concentrations of hydrogen and external donor were also varied to study their effect of polymerization kinetics and polymer microstructure. The estimated activation energies were close to those found {{in the first part of}} this investigation in the presence and/or absence of donor and hydrogen. A polypropylene microstructural study showed a positive effect of hydrogen concentration on mmmm pentad at low donor concentration, likely due to an increase in stereoselectivity of the aspecific sites by hydrogen. However, increasing donor concentration over a given threshold seems to transform the aspecific sitess into stereospecific sites that are no longer significantly affected by hydrogen. These experimental results were compared to a previously developed Monte Carlo model and found to agree with the trends predicted by simulation. Finally, the effect of diisopropyldimethoxysilane (P), n-propyltrimethoxysilane (N), paraethoxyethylbenzoate (PEEB), and dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane (D) external donors on catalyst activity and stereoselectivity was investigated. P and D donors were more stereoselective than N and PEEB donors; however, D donor had the best activity among all donors investigated. Therefore, D donor was mixed with PEEB to combine its high activity with the self-extinguishing properties of PEEB. The D/PEEB 90 / 10 (mol/mol) mixture generated a catalyst with good stereoselectivity but poor activity. When the ratio was increased to 95 / 5 and 98 / 2, the resulting catalyst had high activity and good stereoselectivity. Interestingly, the D/PEEB combination with just a small fraction of PEEB has a positive effect on the catalysts activation term which may decrease polymerization costs with this system...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} for rapid HPLC-based profiling for new GABAA ligands of natural origin has been developed. Active extracts {{are separated by}} a single injection of 3 - 10 mg of extract onto a semi-preparative (150 × 10 mm i. d.) HPLC column with gradient <b>elution</b> and time-based <b>fractionation.</b> The microfractions are tested in an automated two-microelectrode voltage-clamp assay on Xenopus oocytes expressing recombinant GABAA channels composed of α 1, β 2 and γ 2 S subunits. The protocol has been validated by spiking experiments with inactive extract and the GABAA receptor ligand magnolol, and by profiling of active extracts such as valerian extract containing the known GABAA receptor ligand valerenic acid. For dereplication of GABA containing extracts, we established a rapid and simple procedure by which GABA is analyzed as OPA derivative by reversed-phase HPLC. This dereplication protocol was validated with plant and fungal extracts which had been previously tested active or inactive in the oocyte assay and with spiking experiments...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{commonly}} used sulfonylureas (SUs), i. e., thifensulfuron methyl, metsulfuron methyl, triasulfuron, chlorsulfuron, rimsulfuron, tribenuron methyl, and bensulfuron methyl, were extracted from water by off-line solid-phase extraction with a Carbograph 4 cartridge, SUs were then isolated from both humic acids and neutral contaminants by differential <b>elution,</b> Analyte <b>fractionation</b> and quantification were performed by liquid chromatography (LC) with UV detection, Recoveries of SUs extracted from 4 L {{of drinking water}} (10 ng/L spike level), 2 L of groundwater (50 ng/L spike level), and 0. 2 L of river water sample (250 ng/L spike level) were not lower than 94 %, Depending on the particular SU, method detection limits were 0. 6 - 2 ng/L in drinking water, 2 - 9 ng/L in groundwater, and 13 - 40 ng/L in river water, A preservation study of SUs stored on the Carbograph 4 cartridge was conducted, Over 2 weeks of cartridge storage, no significant analyte loss was observed when the cartridge was kept frozen as a precaution, Comparing this method with one using a C- 18 extraction cartridge, the former appeared to be superior to the latter in terms of sensitivity and, chiefly, of selectivity, This method involves confirmatory analysis by LC-electrospray/mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation equipped with a single-quadrupole mass filter. MS data acquisition was performed by a time-scheduled three-ion selected ion monitoring (SIM) program, The necessary structure-significant fragment ions were obtained by controlled decomposition of SU adduct ions after suitably adjusting the electrical held in the desolvation chamber. Under three-ion SIM condition, Limits of detection (S/N = 3) calculated from the ion current profiles of those fragment or parent ions giving the lowest S/N values ranged between 0. 5 (tribenuron methyl) and 3 ng (metsulfuron methyl, thifensulfuron methyl) injected into the LC column...|$|R
