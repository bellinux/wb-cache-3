50|$|The {{implementation}} of <b>reusable</b> plastic <b>containers</b> arises {{as a consequence}} of concerns with sustainability and environmental impact. Use of recyclable plastic packages is beneficial environmentally but is more expensive. The adoption of <b>reusable</b> plastic <b>containers</b> will amount to an approximate annual increase of 0.058 euros/kg of delivered goods. The cost associated with <b>reusable</b> plastic <b>containers</b> are packaging purchasing costs, transportation costs, labor/handling costs, management costs, and costs resulting from losses. Packaging purchasing costs encompasses the cost of the containers as well as any associated service costs. This cost is reoccurring but is only relevant once every 50 cycles, which is the typical lifetime of <b>reusable</b> plastic <b>containers.</b> One cycle consists of the initial stages of processing plastic containers {{all the way to the}} use and recycling of these containers by the consumers. Transportation costs are slightly higher for <b>reusable</b> plastic <b>containers</b> as compared to traditional use and throwaway plastic containers in that these <b>reusable</b> <b>containers</b> need additional transportation to recycling facilities. <b>Reusable</b> plastic <b>containers</b> also require work loading and unloading from trucks as well as quality inspection, this adds additional labor costs. Management costs exists because <b>reusable</b> plastic <b>container</b> stock count needs to be managed. The final cost of <b>reusable</b> plastic <b>containers</b> is the cost incurred when packages are lost or there are errors within the management system. Figure 2 provides a detailed summary of the costs associated with adopting <b>reusable</b> plastic <b>containers.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop models and algorithms to plan the purchasing of reusable containers in a closed-loop supply chain where the demand is increasing. We restrict our study to a periodic review process between a single manufacturer and a single supplier. Each item is transported either in a <b>reusable</b> <b>container</b> or in a single-use disposable. Furthermore, a setup cost is paid every time new containers are purchased. Consequently, our model {{is similar to a}} lot-sizing problem with return of every item after a fixed duration. We study both cases of a deterministic demand as well as a stochastic demand. In the deterministic setting, we use dynamic programming and minimum linear-cost flows to generate polynomial time algorithms. When the demand is stochastic, we use the Markov decision process framework to develop pseudo-polynomial time heuristics for four different strategies. We show the L-natural-convexity of the cost functions for three strategies to speed up the computations. The thesis concludes with an application on a real-life supply chain...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Java 1. 5 {{generics}} {{enable the}} creation of <b>reusable</b> <b>container</b> classes with compiler-enforced type-safe usage. This {{eliminates the need for}} potentially unsafe down-casts when retrieving elements from containers. We present a refactoring that replaces raw references to generic library classes with parameterized references. The refactoring infers actual type parameters for allocation sites and declarations using an existing framework of type constraints, and removes casts that have been rendered redundant. The refactoring was implemented in Eclipse, a popular open-source development environment for Java, and laid the grounds for a similar refactoring in the forthcoming Eclipse 3. 1 release. We evaluated our work by refactoring several Java programs that use the standard collections framework to use Java 1. 5 ’s generic version instead. In these benchmarks, on average, 48. 6 % of the casts are removed, and 91. 2 % of the compiler warnings related to the use of raw types are eliminated. Our approach distinguishes itself from the state-of-the-art [8] by being more scalable, by its ability to accommodate user-defined subtypes of generic library classes, and by being incorporated in a popular integrated development environment. ...|$|E

40|$|Version 1. 5 of the Java {{programming}} language will include gener-ics, a language construct for associating typeparameterswith classes and methods. Generics are particularly useful for creating statically type-safe, <b>reusable</b> <b>container</b> classes such that a store of an inappro-priate type causes a compile-time error, {{and that no}} down-casting is needed when retrieving elements. The standard libraries released with Java 1. 5 will include generic versions of popular container classes such as HashMap and ArrayList. This paper presents a method for refactoring Java programs that use current container classes into equivalent Java 1. 5 programs that use their new generic counterparts. Our method uses a variation on an existing model of type constraints to infer the element types of container objects, and it is parameterized by how much, if any, context sensitivity to exploit when generating these type constraints. We present both a context-insensitive instantiation of the framework and one using a low-cost variation on Agesen’s Cartesian Product Algorithm. The method has been implemented in Eclipse, a popular open-source development environment for Java. We evaluated our approach on several small benchmark programs, and found that, {{in all but one}} case, between 40 % and 100 % of all casts can be removed. 1...|$|E

The eco-cushion compact developed {{in this study was}} high quality, low cost, and meets the requirements of the eco market. The study aimed at developing a <b>reusable</b> <b>container.</b> Dynamic mold temperature control was introduced in the injection modeling process. The innovation in the product was its multi-functional formula invention, eco-product design, one-piece powder case design, and multifunctional design in the big powder case, mold flow and development of dynamic mold temperature control. Finally, through 3 D drawing and modeling, and computer assistance for mold flow and verification to develop and produce models. During the manufacturing process, in order to solve the problems of tightness and warping, development and manufacture of dynamic mold temperature control were introduced. This decreased the injection cycle and residual stress, and deformation of the products has reduced to less than 0. 2 mm, and the air tightness increased. In addition, air leakage was less than 2 % and the injection cycle decreased to at least 10 %. The results of the study can be extended and applied on the future design on cosmetic package and an alternative can be proposed to solve the problems of air tightness and warping.

40|$|Cal Poly Campus Dining has {{a goal of}} {{becoming}} a zero waste entity by providing their customers with alternative methods of disposing their trash. Their current operations produce waste, specifically their methods of packaging the food. Campus dining plans to be more sustainable by providing their customers with <b>reusable</b> <b>containers.</b> The objective of this implementation is to reduce waste produced from one-time use, disposable food containers. The success criteria for the desired system is based around the ability to track and measure the <b>reusable</b> <b>containers</b> to prevent further waste, while providing the user an accommodating environment to ensure they will choose the sustainable option. Our experiment was designed using three objectives: usability, readability, and durability. In order to best accommodate the Cal Poly community, one of the supporting teams calculated the number, and approximate locations, of the return bins that will be collecting the <b>reusable</b> <b>containers.</b> Another supporting team worked on modifying the trash bins currently used at their operations to collect the <b>reusable</b> <b>containers,</b> {{in order to provide}} a seamless transition for the customers. Based on the client’s suggestions, we tested two methods of tagging in order to track and measure the <b>reusable</b> <b>containers.</b> The methods tested were barcode and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Tests were performed on the containers while containing both tags to measure readability. The tags were read using a direct scanner and an indirect scanner. The ultimate goal was to utilize an indirect scanner in order to avoid an additional task for the current Campus Dining employees. The containers were also tested under different conditions, such as placing food inside the container, to test the readability of the tags. The results of the RFID tags ranked far superior when compared to the barcode tags. The measured readability with an indirect scanner of RFID and barcode tags was 100 % and 4. 16 %, respectively. The tags were then tested for durability. The <b>reusable</b> <b>containers</b> would need to be washed after each use through Cal Poly Campus Dining’s dishwasher, the Stereo Commercial Dishwasher model STPCW-ER. A sample of eleven RFID tagged containers was processed through fifty wash cycles. A quality check was performed to find ten of the eleven containers had no water infiltration on the RFID tag, providing a durability success rate of 91 %. The tagged containers were tested again for readability after the fifty wash cycles and all of the tags were read, including the tag that was exposed to water. In conclusion, it is our recommendation to move forward with the zero waste initiative in replacing the current dining disposable containers with RFID tagged <b>reusable</b> <b>containers.</b> The tags will be able to withstand the current cleaning methods, while providing accurate readings when returned into the designated bins. Campus dining will be able to avoid further waste by removing the need to purchase 177, 200 disposable containers annually. A ten-year cost analysis calculated the cost of the implementation to be approximately $ 120, 000, the utility costs to be $ 55, 500, and a depreciated asset cost of $ 280, 000. The total cost of the proposed implementation will result to approximately $ 450, 000 by the end of ten years. In contrast, the current system, using the disposable containers, will result in a cumulative cost of $ 500, 000. The savings after ten years of the proposed system is approximately $ 50, 00...|$|R
40|$|Welcome {{to a new}} column {{committed}} to going and growing green. Together with a little effort, {{we will be able}} to utilize the Chester County Times to present ideas, options, as a springboard each other to make a “greener world” To begin I do not claim to be a “green” expert, and I openly welcome feedback as this is a learning process for me as well as a source for information sharing. My background is medical I am a Registered Nurse at Thomas Jefferson U. Hospital. This column actually was developed in part due to my frustration in obtaining information to make my home, office, and leisure activities as green as possible. Recently I took in the movie “The 11 th Hour” a movie about global warming hosted by Leonardo DiCaprio, the most important piece of information I took away from this movie was that each and every consumer has a vote. A vote is cast by the purchasing power of our individual consumer spending. Whether we choose to purchase greener electricity form our electricity supplier or paper plates vs. styrofoam plates for a picnic, or choices made by office supply purchaser. We can all make a difference little by little to hopefully equal a difference that matters. The first area that everyone can make a difference is to recycle. At home newspaper and post consumer packaging(cereal boxes, envelopes, magazines) should all be bundle in a used paper bag from the supermarket, or tied with string or placed in a plastic recyclable bucket(to be used again and again). Metals cans also make up a large portion of recycling whether aluminum or tin (soda, beer, fruit, and vegetable), old paint cans left open to dry can also be recycled. And finally plastics, according to the thickness of the plastic (all plastic are coded by number of thickness in a triangle located on the package). Each township is different as to the thickness of plastic that it collects. Please refer to your local municipality if there are any questions regarding recycling programs. At work many employers have separate refuse containers. Cans, bottles, paper, and garbage are sorted into different collection bins in most cafeteria setting dining areas. I have heard of worm farms to help dispose of garbage waste at work. Instead of discarding your food scraps, you can recycle them with the help of worms. Vermicomposting (worm composting) turns many types of kitchen waste into a nutritious soil for plants. When worm compost is added to soil, it boosts the nutrients available to plants and enhances soil structure and drainage. Using worms to decompose food waste offers several advantages: It reduces household garbage disposal costs; •	It produces less odor and attracts fewer pests than putting food wastes into a garbage container; •	It saves the water and electricity that kitchen sink garbage disposal units consume; •	It produces a free, high-quality soil amendment (compost); •	It requires little space, labor, or maintenance; •	It spawns free worms for fishing. In the work station confidential paperwork can be shredded in the office or collected in a secure container then taken to be shredded and recycled. Everyday paperwork that is no longer needed or is outdated should be collected and recycled, folders and office supplies reused whenever possible. The following phrase was learned many years ago to help with recycling program: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle it 2 ̆ 7 s a matter of waste minimization the idea is that the first priority is to reduce your use or consumption of something second priority; it you can 2 ̆ 7 t reduce your use of something, then reuse it if you can, and third, if you can 2 ̆ 7 t reuse something, then at least recycle it if you can a good example of this would be water bottles REDUCE your use of water bottles by filling a <b>reusable</b> <b>container</b> from the tap or from your Brita pitcher at home if you do use a water bottle, you can REUSE it a few times (within recommendations for cleanliness) after you have reused it, RECYCLE it.

Having a large container fleet comes with higher acquisition, maintenance, and storage costs, but decreases production down time caused by the lack of containers needed for storage. A quantitative model of these trade-offs will permit decision makers to maintain desired production levels at minimum cost. In this dissertation, the relationship between container fleet size and production down time caused by container shortages is researched. Utilizing both theoretical and empirical approaches, two analytical models that include relevant operational parameters and stochastic components are developed. The first is a container fleet sizing model, and the second model estimates production stoppages as a function of container fleet size. The formulas are shown to be accurate and provide decision makers with the tools to better plan and manage specific applications. The formulas also provide general insight into the factors that affect container fleet size and production stoppage due to container shortages...|$|R
