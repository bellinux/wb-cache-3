5|$|For finite-dimensional representations, the {{presence}} of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz group {{can be dealt with}} the same way as other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones, since the Lie algebra possesses the complete reducibility property. But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of simple connectedness, cannot be dealt with in all the aspects as in the simple framework that applies to simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected simple Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist. Lack of simple connectedness gives rise to spin <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group. The non-connectedness means that, for <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to dealt with separately.|$|E
