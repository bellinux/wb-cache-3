In this approach, the power system network is modeled by the ATP program while the “compiled foreign model ” mechanism of MODELS language is employed to model the digital protective <b>relay</b> in C++ <b>language.</b> This allows “object-oriented ” relay modeling as well as building a “seamless” interface between the power system network model and the relay model. An example is used to demonstrate the interactive protection system simulation developed using the new approach. Index Terms—power system, protection system, relay model, ATP, MODELS, C+...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{rationale}} that corpora {{have an important}} part to play in fostering language awareness, this monograph investigates the use of spoken corpora {{in the teaching of}} German as a foreign language. Corpus-based research has had an increasing influence on language teaching pedagogy, with regard to linguistic content as well as to teaching methodology. While the majority of studies reporting on corpus-based teaching approaches refer to English, {{only a small number of}} studies have discussed such an approach for German. In this study, the exploitation of language corpora is proposed in order to arrive at authentic teaching materials which facilitate the comprehension of German modal particles, which pose numerous problems for learners of German as a foreign language. The approach is twofold: first, the frequency of those word forms which may function as modal particles is established. Secondly, concordance data of the more frequently occurring particles are analysed qualitatively. Teaching materials based on these analyses are developed referring to patterns of use which can be <b>relayed</b> to <b>language</b> learners in order to provide them with tools for the decoding of particle meaning.

40|$|Maria Tymoczko (2005) {{highlights}} four research trajectories {{that are}} likely to be at the forefront of translation studies in coming decades: the attempt to define translation, the internationalization of translation, the impact of technology and globalization on translation theory, and the contextualization of translation studies relative to other areas of academic inquiry. The goal of this thesis is to contribute to the first research trajectory. I hope to enrich current developments in translation studies by offering a new way of conceptualizing translation based upon pragmatist philosophy and its particular approach to language and epistemology. Specifically I build upon certain passages from the works of the contemporary neopragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty (1979; 1989; 1998; 1999) in order to develop a neopragmatist understanding of translation. I demonstrate the cross-disciplinary applicability of a neopragmatist understanding of translation, focusing in particular on visual art, popular science, and political history. I also demonstrate how the neopragmatist framework can be of use in constructing a theory of intersemiotic translation, by means of three case studies of translation between different media. The approach I develop offers a robust philosophical grounding for expanding our conceptualization of translation. Such an approach is motivated by recent research in translation studies highlighting the need for an expanded definition of translation in light of the following issues: traditional definitions of translation tend to be based upon Western views, thus neglecting the diverse international conceptions of translation and contributing to the cultural hegemony of the West; the term “translation” is used in more contexts than traditional definitions would predict; translation is not simply an operation between texts, but can also occur across semiotic systems; translation is not a method of <b>relaying</b> messages across <b>languages</b> through the mediation of a neutral translator, but is instead a complex interface in which a network of cultural, political, socio-historical, communicative, creative, and interpretative factors are intertwined. A neopragmatist framework is useful for building an understanding of translation that responds to the above issues, helping scholars to refine an adequately descriptive and generalized theory of translation...|$|R
40|$|In cross-examination, {{questions}} {{are used by}} counsel strategically to maintain control over witness testimony. In a bilingual courtroom where communication is interpreted, {{it is crucial that}} lawyers' intended questioning strategies be adequately <b>relayed</b> from one <b>language</b> to another. Failure to do so can affect the effectiveness of courtroom questioning and potentially even the outcome of a case. However, achieving such a high level of accuracy is an extremely complex task due to the intricacy of courtroom discourse. Previous studies on the interpretation of courtroom questions have demonstrated interpreters' inadvertent modifications of the pragmatics of courtroom questioning. However, most of these studies are based on English-Spanish courtroom data; interpreters' influence on courtroom questions in other language pairs is rarely investigated. This thesis, therefore, focuses on interpreting cross-examination questions from English to Chinese. More specifically, it investigates the most common pragmalinguistic challenges for achieving accuracy and the role of specialised legal interpreter training in improving accuracy. This thesis, adopting a mixed-methods approach, consists of two components: a discourse analytical study on student interpreters' pragmatic accuracy in a moot court exercise and a quasi-experiment with I&T Master’s students at UNSW. Findings show that it can be challenging to produce pragmatically accurate renditions. Chinese interpreted questions have an overall weakened illocutionary force compared to the original English questions. Declaratives, reported speech declaratives, modal interrogatives, and tag {{questions are}} particularly difficult to interpret into Chinese. Some of the pragmatic shifts are related to the inherent cross-linguistic differences and some occurred despite the similarities between the two languages. Such pragmalinguistic challenges can be addressed by specialised legal interpreter training. Results of the quasi-experiment show that specialised training is conducive to improving interpreters' pragmatic accuracy, that is, interpreters who receive more training tend to perform better on accuracy than those who receive less. This thesis is steeped in a number of research areas: legal interpreting, forensic linguistics, and interpreter training. It not only fills the gap in the knowledge of interpreting courtroom questions from English to Chinese but also has important implications for the education of legal interpreters...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has focused}} on automated power system fault analysis. New contributions to fault section estimation, protection system performance evaluation and power system/protection system interactive simulation have been achieved. Intelligent techniques including expert systems, fuzzy logic and Petri-nets, as well as data from remote terminal units (RTUs) of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, and digital protective relays have been explored and utilized to fufill the objectives. The task of fault section estimation is difficult when multiple faults, failures of protection devices, and false data are involved. A Fuzzy Reasoning Petri-nets approach has been proposed to tackle the complexities. In this approach, the fuzzy reasoning starting from protection system status data and ending with estimation of faulted power system section is formulated by Petri-nets. The reasoning process is implemented by matrix operations. Data from RTUs of SCADA systems and digital protective relays are used as inputs. Experiential tests {{have shown that the}} proposed approach is able to perform accurate fault section estimation under complex scenarios. The evaluation of protection system performance involves issues of data acquisition, prediction of expected operations, identification of unexpected operations and diagnosis of the reasons for unexpected operations. An automated protection system performance evaluation application has been developed to accomplish all the tasks. The application automatically retrieves relay files, processes relay file data, and performs rule-based analysis. Forward chaining reasoning is used for prediction of expected protection operation while backward chaining reasoning is used for diagnosis of unexpected protection operations. Lab tests have shown that the developed application has successfully performed relay performance analysis. The challenge of power system/protection system interactive simulation lies in modeling of sophisticated protection systems and interfacing the protection system model and power system network model seamlessly. An approach which utilizes the "compiled foreign model" mechanism of ATP MODELS language is proposed to model multifunctional digital protective <b>relays</b> in C++ <b>language</b> and seamlessly interface them to the power system network model. The developed simulation environment has been successfully used for the studies of fault section estimation and protection system performance evaluation...|$|R
