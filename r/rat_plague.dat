40|$|Madagascar {{remains one}} of the world's largest plague foci. The black rat, Rattus rattus, is the main {{reservoir}} of plague in rural areas. This species is highly susceptible to plague in plague-free areas (low-altitude regions), whereas rats from the plague focus areas (central highlands) have evolved a disease-resistance polymorphism. We used the candidate gene CCR 5 to investigate the genetic basis of plague resistance in R. rattus. We found a unique non-synonymous substitution (H 184 R) in a functionally important region of the gene. We then compared (i) CCR 5 genotypes of dying and surviving plague-challenged rats and (ii) CCR 5 allelic frequencies in plague focus and plague-free populations. Our results suggested a higher prevalence of the substitution in resistant animals compared to susceptible individuals, and a tendency for higher frequencies in plague focus areas compared to plague-free areas. Therefore, the CCR 5 polymorphism may be involved in Malagasy black <b>rat</b> <b>plague</b> resistance. CCR 5 and other undetermined plague resistance markers may provide useful biological information about host evolution and disease dynamics...|$|E

40|$|To assess its {{potential}} applications in plague surveillance and control programmes, an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) that captures the specific Yersinia pestis F 1 antigen {{was used to determine}} the amounts of this antigen present in samples of blood and spleens from laboratory <b>rats</b> with acute <b>plague,</b> in the buboes of <b>rats</b> with chronic <b>plague,</b> and in tissues from the carcasses of rats that had died from <b>plague.</b> In <b>rats</b> with acute <b>plague,</b> bacteria and F 1 antigen were detected in samples of blood 2 - 4 days after the rats had been subcutaneously inoculated with virulent Y. pestis.

40|$|Plague in NaturePlague occurs {{naturally}} {{in the western}} U. S., especially in the semi-arid grasslands and scrub woodlands of the southwestern states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. The plague bacterium (Yersinia pestis) is transmitted by fleas and cycles naturally among wild rodents, including rock squirrels, ground squirrels, prairie dogs and wood <b>rats.</b> <b>Plague</b> in HumansOccasionally, infections among rodents increase dramatically, causing an outbreak, or epizootic. During plague epizootics, many rodents die, causing hungry fleas to seek other sources of blood. Studies suggest that epizootics in the southwestern U. S. are more likely during cooler summers that follow wet winters. Humans and domestic animals that are bitten by fleas from dead animals {{are at risk for}} contracting plague, especially during an epizootic. Cats usually become very ill from plague and can directly infect humans when they cough infectious droplets into the air. Dogs {{are less likely to be}} ill, but they can still bring plague-infected fleas into the home. In addition to flea bites, people can be exposed while handling skins or flesh of infected animals.

50|$|An active {{privateer}} in the West Indies {{as early}} as 1607, Elfrith commanded the Treasurer (owned by the Earl of Warwick) for several years. In mid-1613, Elfrith arrived in Bermuda with a Spanish caravel full of grain for the starving island colonists. As England and Spain were not at war, this was technically considered an act of piracy although this fact went unnoticed by the colony. However, the ship also contained black rats which escaped from the ship as the grain was being unloaded in a harbor off St. George's. They quickly bred and were soon nesting in palm trees {{as well as the}} thatched roofs of cottages, churches and storehouses. The rats dug holes in the soft coral, feeding on corn and wheat in storehouses and eating the crops and other plants grown by the colony. Despite the colonists attempts to exterminate them, which included using traps, hunting dogs and setting cats into the wild, the <b>rats</b> <b>plagued</b> the colony for several years before the problem was finally brought under control.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn Madagascar, {{the black}} rat, Rattus rattus, {{is the main}} {{reservoir}} of plague (Yersinia pestis infection), a disease still responsible for hundreds of cases each year in this country.

500|$|The player's {{actions are}} not {{judged to be}} good or evil, but instead are tracked by a [...] "chaos" [...] system that records the amounts of {{friendly}} fire, violence, and deaths the player causes.

Expanding on earlier studies that demonstrated a role played by Lpp in Yersinia pestis virulence in mouse models of bubonic and pneumonic plague, we characterized anmsbB in-frame deletion mutant incapable of producing an acyltransferase that is responsible for the addition of lauric acid to the lipid Amoiety of LPS, as well as alppmsbB double mutant of the highly virulent Y. pestis CO 92 strain. Although themsbB single mutant was minimally attenuated, thelpp single mutant and thelppmsbB double mutant were significantly more attenuated than the isogenic wild-type (WT) bacterium in bubonic and pneumonic animal models (mouse and <b>rat)</b> of <b>plague.</b> These data correlated with greatly reduced survivability of the aforemen-tionedmutants in murine macrophages. Furthermore, thelppmsbB double mutant was grossly compromised in its ability to disseminate to distal organs in mice and in evoking cytokines/chemokines in infected animal tissues. Importantly, mice that sur-vived challenge with thelppmsbB double mutant, but not thelpp ormsbB single mutant, in a pneumonic plague model were significantly protected against a subsequent lethal WT CO 92 rechallenge.

50|$|In 1898, the French {{scientist}} Paul-Louis Simond (who {{had also}} come to China to battle the Third Pandemic) established the rat-flea vector that drives the disease. He had noted that persons who became ill {{did not have to}} be in close contact with each other to acquire the disease. In Yunnan, China, inhabitants would flee from their homes as soon as they saw dead rats, and on the island of Formosa (Taiwan), residents considered the handling of dead rats heightened the risks of developing plague. These observations led him to suspect that the flea might be an intermediary factor in the transmission of plague, since people acquired plague only if they were in contact with recently dead rats, who had died less than 24 hours before. In a now classic experiment, Simond demonstrated how a healthy <b>rat</b> died of <b>plague,</b> after infected fleas had jumped to it, from a rat which had recently died of the plague.|$|R
2500|$|In the Late Middle Ages (1340–1400) Europe {{experienced}} the most deadly disease outbreak in history when the Black Death, the infamous pandemic of bubonic plague, hit in 1347, killing {{a third of}} the human population. Some historians believe that society subsequently became more violent as the mass mortality rate cheapened life and thus increased warfare, crime, popular revolt, waves of flagellants, and persecution. [...] The Black Death originated in or near China and spread from Italy and then throughout other European countries. Arab historians Ibn Al-Wardni and Almaqrizi believed the Black Death originated in Mongolia. Chinese records also showed a huge outbreak in Mongolia in the early 1330s. Research published in 2002 suggests that it began in early 1346 in the steppe region, where a plague reservoir stretches from the northwestern shore of the Caspian Sea into southern Russia. The Mongols had cut off the trade route, the Silk Road, between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe. The epidemic began with an attack that Mongols launched on the Italian merchants' last trading station in the region, Caffa in the Crimea. In late 1346, plague broke out among the besiegers and from them penetrated into the town. When spring arrived, the Italian merchants fled on their ships, unknowingly carrying the Black Death. Carried by the fleas on <b>rats,</b> the <b>plague</b> initially spread to humans near the Black Sea and then outwards to the rest of Europe as a result of people fleeing from one area to another.|$|R
