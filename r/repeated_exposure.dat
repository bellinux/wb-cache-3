5|$|Partial {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after <b>repeated</b> <b>exposure</b> to potent full agonists or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E

40|$|Clustered {{structure}} of social networks provides {{the chances of}} <b>repeated</b> <b>exposures</b> to carriers with similar information. It is commonly believed {{that the impact of}} <b>repeated</b> <b>exposures</b> on the spreading of information is nontrivial. Does this effect increase the probability that an individual forwards a message in social networks? If so, to what extent does this effect influence people's decisions on whether or not to spread information? Based on a large-scale microblogging data set, which logs the message spreading processes and users' forwarding activities, we conduct a data-driven analysis to explore the answer to the above questions. The results show that an overwhelming majority of message samples are more probable to be forwarded under <b>repeated</b> <b>exposures,</b> compared to those under only a single exposure. For those message samples that cover various topics, we observe a relatively fixed, topic-independent multiplier of the willingness of spreading when <b>repeated</b> <b>exposures</b> occur, regardless of the differences in network structure. We believe that this finding reflects average people's intrinsic psychological gain under repeated stimuli. Hence, it makes sense that the gain is associated with personal response behavior, rather than network structure. Moreover, we find that the gain is robust against the change of message popularity. This finding supports that there exists a relatively fixed gain brought by <b>repeated</b> <b>exposures.</b> Based on the above findings, we propose a parsimonious model to predict the saturated numbers of forwarding activities of messages. Our work could contribute to better understandings of behavioral psychology and social media analytics...|$|R

After <b>repeated</b> <b>exposure,</b> the observing organism will begin to react fondly to the once novel stimulus.

The individuals were then told that these symbols represented adjectives and were asked to rate whether the symbols held positive or negative connotations. The symbols that had been previously seen by the test subjects were consistently rated more positively than those unseen. In a similar experiment, the individuals were not asked to rate the connotations of the symbols, but to describe their mood after the experiment.

PHARMACOL BIOCHEM BEHAV 53 (4) 771 - 776, 1996. -Acute {{exposure to the}} organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) on gestation day 12 (GD 12, 200 mg/kg/ml, SC) causes extensive neurochemical changes in maternal brain but lesser changes in fetal brain. In the present study, we examined the relative neurotoxicity of <b>repeated,</b> lower-level CPF <b>exposures</b> during gestation in rats. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to CPF (6. 25, 12. 5, or 25 mg/kg per day, SC) from GD 12 - 19 and sampled at either GD 16, GD 20, or postnatal day 3 (PND 3) for measurement of various maternal and developmental neurochemical markers. In contrast o the high acute dose exposure, no maternal toxicity was noted with repeated lower-level dosing. Extensive acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition (83 ~ 90 %) was noted in maternal brain at all three time points following <b>repeated</b> <b>exposures</b> (25 mg/kg). Higher AChE inhibition (58 %) was noted in fetal brain at CD 20 compared to 19 - 25070 on PND 3 in treated pups cross-fostered to control dams and in control pups cross-fostered to treated dams following <b>repeated</b> <b>exposures</b> (25 mg/kg per day).

40|$|PosterInternational audienceThe {{expression}} of heat-shock proteins (HSP) had been observed after exposure to low-level radiofrequency fields (RFR) exposure in worms and in human endothelial cells. These data have been hypothetically linked at best to stress, and at worse to cancer. Further studies failed to confirm these RFR bioeffects, while very few experiments {{have looked at}} the {{expression of}} Hsp in mammals exposed to RFR. Earlier however, changes in hsp 70 mRNA were reported in the brain on rats exposed to a GSM- 900 signal. In this study, we have investigated the effects of a single <b>exposure</b> or <b>repeated</b> <b>exposures</b> to two mobile phone-related RFR signals (GSM- 1800 MHz and UMTS) on Hsp 25 and Hsp 70 expression in rat brains. Groups of 8 male Wistar rats were exposed to RFR using a loop antenna at a brain averaged specific absorption rate (BASAR) of 2. 6 W/kg. BASAR characterisation was performed as previously described at 900 MHz. Rats were submitted to either a single 2 -hour <b>exposure</b> or <b>repeated</b> <b>exposures</b> (two hours/day, five days/week, four weeks). Controls for restraining stress, cage-control and positive-control rats were included. Rats were trained to the setup to avoid stress. At the end of exposure, rat brains were fixed, frozen, and coded. 10 μm sections were prepared and stained with anti-Hsp 25 and anti-inducible Hsp 70 antibodies. The cerebral cortex and the hippocampus were analysed. The significance of differences between groups was evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. <b>Repeated</b> <b>exposures</b> to UMTS induced an increased expression of Hsp 25 and Hsp 70 in the retrosplenial cortex and in the hippocampus. A drop in the amount of both Hsp was observed in both the cortex and the hippocampus after a single exposure to GSM- 1800, while <b>repeated</b> <b>exposures</b> to GSM- 1800 increased Hsp 25 expression in the motor and retrosplenial cortex and Hsp 70 in the motor cortex. Decreased expression of Hsp, as observed after single exposure to GSM- 1800, has been described after treatments with Benzo[a]pyrene or TNFα, but its physiological significance is not clearly established. Our results suggested that <b>repeated</b> <b>exposures</b> to UMTS and GSM- 1800 are capable of increasing HSP expression. According to the experimental evidence of the carcinogenic potential of low-level RFR, increase in HSP expression is unlikely to be linked to cancer. We hypothesised that <b>repeated</b> <b>exposures</b> to mobile phone signals may be perceived as a stress and may participate in an adaptative process in the rat brain...|$|R
