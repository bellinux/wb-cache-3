40|$|The Internet's {{explosive}} growth motivates {{a shift from}} standalone single-purpose applications to network-centric software systems that consist of independent and widely distributed components. Such systems use open protocols to combine the services of components {{in the context of}} workflow processes, with multiple participants utilizing diverse resources to perform tasks with data and temporal dependencies. Workflow process support is the application domain of workflow management systems, which however, due to their rigid client/server structure and their implicit assumption that they are the sole governing authority in charge of operations, fail to provide the flexibility required in order to support processes involving autonomous participants with a severely limited degree of control over each other's internal state and procedures. In open systems, explicit agreements are required in order to establish communication channels and other necessary arrangements for co-operation. Such agreements should also cover service-level aspects, such as access control policies, exception handling behavior, and performance-related attributes. This thesis presents the Aurora infrastructure, a step towards integrating service-level agreements in a framework that represents resources, tasks and work sessions among autonomous service-provisioning authorities. By shifting the focus from managing component state transitions, as in most previous systems, to managing asynchronous requests for performing services, the Aurora infrastructure preserves the autonomy of service providers and facilitates the composition of services without requiring tight coupling of the systems that need to be integrated for composing a service. The Aurora infrastructure supports service-level agreements that describe attributes of components related to access <b>restrictions,</b> <b>exception</b> handling capabilities, and expected performance. Service-level agreements are explicitly represented as run-time objects that encapsulate references to components that implement services. Service-level agreement objects mediate all interactions between service providers and their customers, allowing reliable tracking of the interaction state, monitoring of conformance to commitments on service-level attributes, and automated reaction upon detecting deviations from the expected behavior. Support for service-level management in an open distributed run-time environment is the main contribution of this thesis. The OMG CORBA platform for distributed applications was used as the implementation basis. This platform was extended with a CORBA-based component model, a container execution framework, event notification services, an access control framework, and a logging/monitoring service. A directory service was developed to maintain metadata that describe components made available by independent providers and their service-level attributes. This directory service complements the functionality of the OMG CORBA Interface Repository. A scripting language, HERMES, was developed {{as an extension of the}} popular scripting language Tcl. The HERMES interpreter is a tool to assist in component configuration and interconnection, offering primitives for obtaining and managing references to CORBA objects and components, invoking state monitoring and control operations, issuing and tracking asynchronous requests, and managing asycnhronous event notifications. These extensions to the OMG CORBA platform for distributed applications are a requisite step towards an open distributed platform for service composition. Service-level agreements and the component/container framework are utilized in the development of a work session framework. Work sessions are managed collections of resources made available by autonomous providers, and enforce an access control policy specified by the collection owner. Thus, work sessions provide a resource sharing context that respects the autonomy of providers. Session resources encapsulate references either to components that directly implement services, or to service-level agreement objects that mediate the sequencing of service performance under the terms promised by autonomous service providers. In this framework, work is carried out by issuing asynchronous requests for service performance. Composite tasks that require several resources can be explicitly represented in this framework, allowing for explicit representation of the producer/consumer dependencies between session resources. This work session framework, in conjunction with the component/container framework and the service-level agreement framework, demonstrates a viable alternative to the currently predominant architecture of workflow management systems. Two case studies demonstrate the functionality offered by the Aurora infrastructure. A WWW Link Recommendation service was developed by composition of two popular WWW services, to highlight the requirements of network-centric applications, and pinpoint missing functionality in existing distributed object infrastructures. A case study from the domain of electronic commerce was developed so as to demonstrate the proposed approach in supporting interactions between service providers and customers based on service-level agreements. This case study also provided the basis for a qualitative comparison with the OMG jointFlow framework for workflow based on distributed objects.

Assessments were made by multiple surface electromyogram (EMG) and kinematic recording. Mean gestational age at birth for the children with spastic hemiplegia and those with bilateral CP was 28. 6 weeks (SEM 0. 33) and 28. 2 weeks (SEM 0. 34) respectively; their mean birthweights were 1158 g (SEM 58) and 1190 g (SEM 59) respectively. All {{but one of the}} children with spastic hemiplegia could walk without <b>restriction,</b> the <b>exception</b> being a child who had self-mobility with limitations.

Results indicated that in most children with CP the basic level of postural control ('direction-specificity', ie. muscle activation on the side opposite to direction of body sway) was intact. However, the children with CP showed dysfunctions in: (1) recruitment order of the postural muscles, i. e. they exhibited a stereotyped top-down recruitment; and (2) the ability to modulate muscle contraction (that registers on EMG) to task-specific conditions. The latter dysfunction was more pronounced in children with bilateral CP than in those with spastic hemiplegia.

40|$|Modern day sex {{offender}} legislation was first {{implemented in the}} early 1990 s {{in response to a}} number of headline-grabbing incidents. Seeking to protect families and children, federal and state legislators passed regulations aimed at tracking, monitoring, and controlling released {{sex offender}}s. A key portion of these legislative developments include state and local level residency restrictions, which prevent sex offenders from living within an established distance—usually 1000 to 2500 feet—of various places where children gather, such as schools and daycare facilities. These laws have created enormous hardship for released sex offenders as they attempt to reintegrate into society, and the effectiveness of these laws has increasingly been rejected. This Note argues for the implementation of more sensible sex offender legislation, including prioritizing individualized assessments over blanket <b>restrictions,</b> making an <b>exception</b> to allow offenders to live with family, and providing resources to help offenders comply with restrictions.

It is in relation to achieving this balance that this thesis argues that bilateral investment treaties’ (BITs) regulation of capital transfers is deficient, both substantively and procedurally. On substance, this thesis identifies three substantive defects that affect obligations under BITs: absoluteness, immediacy, and breadth. First, many BITs adopt an absolute approach in liberalizing capital that does not permit any <b>restrictions</b> or <b>exceptions,</b> nor does it distinguish between different kinds of capital, or between the right to import capital and the right to repatriate capital. Second, the obligation to permit transfers is immediate and does not allow for a gradual liberalization of capital. Third, many BITs’ terms and obligations are broad and therefore vague, such as the broad definition of investment, or the obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment, which is also broad and interpreted in a manner that restricts the regulatory powers of the host state. Such results could have been partly mitigated if there were a dispute settlement mechanism with the power to create precedent and with it a clearer and more coherent body of rules.

Religious freedom is the norm, <b>restrictions</b> are the <b>exception.</b> That is how {{religious}} freedom usually is perceived in a modern democratic society. And yet religious freedom is never fully achieved. Even if sometimes restrictions are unavoidable, they always constitute a danger, as any restriction inevitably results in less freedom.

The first level deals with solemn principles and main ideas, including both the international framework and constitutional law. The second level goes into the viewpoint of the ordinary legislator and tries to elucidate the question whether, and to what extent, ordinary legislation limits religious freedom. Finally, the last level concerns the more elusive domain of concrete policy, of administrative practice at a lower level.

40|$|Abstract Background Comparative {{analysis}} of gene expression among serotypes within a species can provide valuable information on important differences between related genomes. For the pig lung pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, 15 serotypes with a considerable variation in virulence potential and immunogenicity have been identified. This serotypic diversity can only partly {{be explained by}} amount of capsule and differences in the RTX toxin genes in their genomes. Iron acquisition in vivo is an important bacterial function and in pathogenic bacteria, iron-limitation is often a signal for the induction of virulence genes. We used a pan-genomic microarray to study the transcriptional response to iron restriction in vitro in six serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae (1, 2, 3, 5 b, 6, and 7), representing at least two levels of virulence. Results In total, 45 genes were significantly (p A. pleuropneumoniae was the up-regulation of a putative cirA -like siderophore in all six serotypes. Three genes, recently described in A. pleuropneumoniae as possibly coding for haemoglobin-haptoglobin binding proteins, displayed significant serotype related up-regulation to iron limitation. For all three genes, the expression appeared at its lowest in serotype 3, which is generally {{considered one of the}} least virulent serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae. The three genes share homology with the hmbR haemoglobin receptor of Neisseria meningitidis, a possible virulence factor which contributes to bacterial survival in rats. Conclusions By comparative {{analysis of}} gene expression among 6 different serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae we identified a common set of presumably essential core genes, involved in iron regulation. The results support and expand previous observations concerning the identification of new potential iron acquisition systems in A. pleuropneumoniae, showing that this bacterium has evolved several strategies for scavenging the limited iron resources of the host. The combined effect of iron-depletion and serotype proved to be modest, indicating that serotypes of both moderate and high virulence at least in vitro are reacting almost identical to iron <b>restriction.</b> One notable <b>exception,</b> however, is the haemoglobin-haptoglobin binding protein cluster which merits further investigation. </p...|$|R
40|$|A primary {{mechanism}} to maintain cell homeostasis is apoptosis, a programmed or regulated form of cell death {{that controls the}} accumulation of defective cells. An imbalance of this process may result in the onset of several diseases, particularly those associated with aging. Calorie restriction has been proven to increase longevity and influence healthy aging by improving tissue performance and delaying the onset of age-related diseases. The underlying mechanisms of these effects likely involve decreased oxidative stress and optimization of mitochondrial bioenergetics in a tissue specific manner. This study investigated the effects of calorie restriction and those changes induced by the predominant fat source (lard, soybean oil, fish oil) in calorie-restricted diets on kidney apoptosis in relation to aging in mice fed experimental diets for 6 or 18 months. Markers related to apoptotic signaling, apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF- 1) and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC- 1), were measured for the different experimental conditions by following a Western blot methodology. Due {{to the role of}} ubiquinone (coenzyme Q, CoQ) in energy metabolism, alterations in CoQ biosynthesis may modify CoQ levels in tissues. Thus, the levels of coenzyme Q (CoQ) were determined by reversed-phase HPLC separation; also, mitochondrial cellular respiration was measured via citrate synthase mitochondrial marker enzyme. Results indicated that the distribution of APAF- 1 in the cytosol demonstrates no significant effects in dietary fat source in the control groups of mice fed under calorie <b>restriction</b> with the <b>exception</b> of those in which lard is the primary source of dietary fat. These findings suggest that apoptosis signaling is deceased in calorie-restricted diets in which lard is used as the primary fat source.

Lastly, results of the levels of coenzyme Q suggest an increase with age in mice. In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} suggest that calorie restriction and the predominant fat source in calorie-restricted diets indeed induce effects on kidney apoptosis in relation to aging...|$|R

40|$|Conference Theme: Rule of Law and Justice in East Asia: Challenges in Trasnsition to a Multicultural SocietySession - Rule of Law-RawlsThe {{governance}} {{of information is}} of the essence of the {{governance of}} contemporary societies. Human rights covenants admit of restrictions in freedom of expression so that legitimate goals can be accomplished even within societies of liberal and democratic tradition. The international trade system encompasses exceptions to free trade, including information-based free trade, insofar as these are relied on to protect the public morals or public order of a member country. Eastern societies have actively deployed such <b>restrictions</b> and <b>exceptions</b> in order to preserve their political and cultural traditions and the values upon which these rest. Western liberal democracies, however, have been highly critical of these developments (though all the while also practicing them), as if the very idea of restrictions on information flows would be something conceptually unthinkable within a liberal framework. An argument that has often been applied as a justification in Western criticisms is the argument of neutrality, which in this regard is extended as much to the state as to non-state actors who act as gatekeepers of information flows. Restrictions on the flow of information, the argument goes, reflect choices on values and conceptions of the good that any liberal framework should refrain from making; rather, instead of to states and corporations, such choices should be left to individuals in the exercise of their moral powers as free and equal persons. The theoretical roots of such an argument are rarely rendered explicit so as to lend them to a more precise statement as the one just attempted. Yet, we can trace their conception and origin in political theory to a principle of political neutrality that we find most prominently stated in John Rawls’s work. This paper, however, will demonstrate the difficulties of applying John Rawls’s political thought to the governance of information. Such difficulties, the paper argues, stem from the fact that Rawlsian political liberalism conceives of information as a one-dimensional category and of its regulation as a uniform phenomenon across the liberal world. This enables one to treat information as always a political concept – one belonging, that is, in the scope of public reason. Understanding so, in turn, is an essential premise for holding Rawlsian theory demands access to information as a matter of distributive justice. Indeed, works that evaluate the question of access to information with regard to Rawls’s theory of justice have so far widely relied upon such a premise (e. g. Van den Hoven and Rooksby; Merges; and Ng). Yet, once one attends to the deep structure of information (to use Noam Chomsky’s expression) and uncovers the challenge of meaning, once one comes to see that there is much in information that is public as well as that there is much in it that is private, the essence of Rawlsian political liberalism is short-circuited. In ways that this paper will explain, Rawls’s own principle of neutrality makes his theory inapplicable to the regulation of the most typical realms of contemporary information-based societies, where power is exercised in ways extending much beyond the restrained public realm of the Rawlsian basic structure. Understanding so offers an explanation for why the regulation of information flows takes and ought to take place in societies of different political affiliations, be them liberal or less so...|$|R
