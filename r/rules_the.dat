5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound.

The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by <b>rules.</b> <b>The</b> rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E
