No <b>relationship</b> was observed <b>between</b> <b>the</b> “guilty” dimension of emotional competence and task performance. Non-hierarchical cluster analysis was selected and K-means cluster analysis was performed to determine the emotional competence levels of participant banking professionals. The seven pre-specified emotional competences were classified by using Ward’s method. Cluster analysis revealed that the emotional competences of the participants were clustered in two groups as high and low. Regression analyses revealed insignificant <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> emotional competence and task performance of employees, but positive significant <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> emotional competence and contextual performance. Significant differences were also observed in the emotional competence levels and task-contextual performances of employees. In other words, individuals with high emotional competence levels also exhibited high performances...|$|R
