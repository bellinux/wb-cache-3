5|$|Life on Earth {{seemed to}} recover quickly after the Permian extinctions, {{though this was}} mostly {{in the form of}} {{disaster}} taxa such as the hardy Lystrosaurus. Specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems with high biodiversity, complex food webs, and a variety of niches, took much longer to recover. Current research indicates that this long <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> due to successive waves of extinction, which inhibited recovery, and to prolonged environmental stress to organisms that continued into the Early Triassic. Recent research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-Triassic, 4M to 6M years after the extinction; and some writers estimate that the <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> not complete until 30M years after the P-Tr extinction, i.e. in the late Triassic.|$|E
5|$|After Manzikert, {{a partial}} <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> made {{possible}} {{due to the}} efforts of the Komnenian dynasty. This is sometimes referred to as the Komnenian restoration. The first emperor of this royal line was Alexios I Komnenos (whose life and policies would be described by his daughter Anna Komnene in the Alexiad). Alexios's long reign of nearly 37 years was full of struggle. At his accession in 1081, the Byzantine Empire was in chaos after a prolonged period of civil war resulting from the defeat at Manzikert.|$|E

50|$|If {{all these}} {{assumptions}} are satisfied, then fitting an exponential to the recovery curve {{will give the}} off rate constant, koff. However, other dynamics can give recovery curves similar to exponentials, so fitting an exponential does not necessarily imply that <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> dominated by a simple bimolecular reaction. One way to distinguish between recovery with a rate determined by unbinding and <b>recovery</b> that <b>is</b> limited by diffusion, is {{to note that the}} recovery rate for unbinding-limited <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> independent {{of the size of the}} bleached area r, while it scales as , for diffusion-limited recovery. Thus if a small and a large area <b>are</b> bleached, if <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> limited by unbinding then the <b>recovery</b> rates will <b>be</b> the same for the two sizes of bleached area, whereas if <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> limited by diffusion then it will be much slower for the larger bleached area.|$|R
5|$|From summer 2005, {{the media}} had linked Cissé with a move away from Anfield. Speculation {{intensified}} as the season went on. In early June 2006, {{it was reported that}} a transfer to Olympique de Marseille had been agreed. The very same day Cissé broke his leg during France's final warm up match against China on 7 June 2006. It was thought that even though a relatively quick <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> expected, Cissé's transfer would be postponed until at least the January transfer window. However, the two teams agreed a loan deal in July 2006.|$|E
5|$|Improvement of {{neurological}} function usually occurs {{for two or}} {{more years}} after the trauma. For many years {{it was believed that}} <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> fastest during the first six months, but {{there is no evidence to}} support this. It may be related to services commonly being withdrawn after this period, rather than any physiological limitation to further progress. Children recover better in the immediate time frame and improve for longer periods.|$|E
5|$|In Missouri, at the Lisbon Bottoms {{section of}} the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, wild pallid {{sturgeon}} larvae were collected in 1998. These nonhatchery-raised larvae were the first recovered on the lower Missouri River in the previous 50years. The <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> made along a side channel of the Missouri River that had been developed to provide suitable habitat for pallid sturgeon and other fish spawning. The side channel was apparently {{being used by the}} larva pallid sturgeon for protection from the swifter currents of the Missouri River.|$|E
50|$|The {{recovery}} amount from ongoing entitlement {{is affected}} by the amount of weekly normal entitlement. The minimum housing benefit that can be paid, regardless of overpayment <b>recovery,</b> <b>is</b> 50p per week. For example, if the entitlement is £7.50 and the overpayment <b>recovery</b> level <b>is</b> £9.90, the claimant will receive 50p every week until <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> complete with £7.00 going towards the overpayment.|$|R
50|$|Between December 1947 and December 1949, 6000 {{females were}} {{recovered}} from Pakistan and 12,000 from India.

50|$|Predicted {{chances of}} <b>recovery</b> <b>are</b> {{variable}} owing to different techniques {{used to measure}} the extent of neurological damage. All the predictions are based on statistical rates with some level of chance for recovery present: a person with a low chance of recovery may still awaken. Time is the best general predictor of a chance of recovery: after four months of coma caused by brain damage, the chance of partial <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> less than 15%, and the chance of full <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> very low.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} of taller buildings during the 1870s was hindered {{by the financial}} Panic of 1873 and the ensuing economic depression, which lasted until around 1879. Construction slowed, and property values slumped. By 1880, however, the <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> well underway, with new construction in New York returning to the pace of 1871, and the economic upturn making the {{construction of}} taller buildings an attractive financial option again, establishing many of the preconditions {{for the development of}} the skyscraper.|$|E
5|$|The {{responsibility}} of the <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the Governor of Svalbard on 30 August, since there were no survivors. In addition, police personnel from the mainland were transferred to Svalbard {{to work with the}} investigation and recovery. The work was supplemented by local volunteers. Because of the bad weather, which included fog and snow, it was often impossible to transport workers to the plateau, and work therefore started in the valley.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the Black Death struck England with full force, killing a third {{or more of the}} country's population. This loss of {{manpower}} led to a shortage of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The great landowners struggled with the shortage of manpower and the resulting inflation in labour cost. To curb the rise in wages, the king and parliament responded with the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempts to regulate wages could not succeed in the long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour. All in all, the plague did not lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> remarkably swift. This was to a large extent thanks to the competent leadership of royal administrators such as Treasurer William Edington and Chief Justice William de Shareshull.|$|E

5|$|In 1870 republican {{sentiment}} in Britain {{was given a}} boost when the French Emperor, Napoleon III, was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War and the French Third Republic was declared. However, {{in the winter of}} 1871, a brush with death led to an improvement in both Edward's popularity with the public and his relationship with his mother. While staying at Londesborough Lodge, near Scarborough, North Yorkshire, Edward contracted typhoid, the disease that was believed to have killed his father. There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests (Lord Chesterfield) died. Edward's <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> greeted with almost universal relief. Public celebrations included the composition of Arthur Sullivan's Festival Te Deum. Edward cultivated politicians from all parties, including republicans, as his friends, and thereby largely dissipated any residual feelings against him.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Hazel, a three-day period of national mourning was declared in Haiti for hurricane victims. With existing infrastructure already poor, the <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> very slow {{since many of the}} few existing roads were blocked, and communications equipment was either out, damaged, or destroyed. The Haitian Red Cross appealed for assistance to the International Red Cross, while the American Red Cross made a donation of $25,000 (1954 USD). Pan American World Airways offered the use of its planes to assist with the delivery of aid, and the US aircraft carrier USS Saipan deployed 18 helicopters to help deliver supplies. Despite the relief effort, there was an outbreak of typhoid fever following Hazel {{due to a lack of}} clean water.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the service, {{lifeboat}} launch and <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> usually undertaken by women. There were deeply-held views about women actually crewing the boats themselves – it was considered extremely bad luck. Along all parts part of the coastline, women supported their men on the lifeboat crews by working together to get the lifeboat afloat and then later recovering it from the water in readiness for when the next call came. While lifeboat crew are still predominantly male (92%), the first female (inshore) crew member was Elizabeth Hostvedt in 1969, and Frances Glody was the first woman crew member on an all-weather lifeboat, at Dunmore East Lifeboat Station, in 1981. Lauren McGuire, at the age of 27, became the RNLI's youngest station manager in 2011, at Clovelly, Devon.|$|E
30|$|In {{real-time}} {{main memory}} databases [5 – 7], the main copy of database {{works in the}} volatile RAM, and the data is very vulnerable, so the <b>recovery</b> <b>is</b> necessary.

While recovering from a fault, real-time main memory databases need to satisfy multiple constraints [10, 11], and this pose a huge challenge for designing reasonable recovering strategies.|$|R

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2001 season, Aidoo broke his leg while filming Brian's Song. Although {{initially}} expected to heal in time for training camp, Aidoo's <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> slower than expected, and he missed the first two games of the season with a broken right fibula. Aidoo returned to the Marauders in mid-September. In his first game back, Aidoo scored two touchdowns and broke the OUA conference record for career touchdowns with 35 total majors. He played a large role in a 27–15 upset of first-ranked Ottawa, scoring two of three touchdowns in the final five minutes of the game. Due to recurring issues with his healing leg, Aidoo missed multiple games in October but returned for the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} his staff were anxious for the {{president}} to appear to be recovering quickly, and the morning after his operation he saw visitors and signed a piece of legislation. Reagan left the hospital on the 13th day. Initially, he worked two hours a day in the White House's residential quarters, with meetings held there instead of the Oval Office. Reagan did not lead a Cabinet meeting until day 26, did not leave Washington until day 49, and did not hold a press conference until day 79. Ruge, the Physician to the President, thought <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> not complete until October. Reagan's plans for the month after the shooting were canceled, including a visit to the Mission Control Center at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, in April 1981 during STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle. Vice President Bush instead called the orbiting astronauts during their mission. Reagan would visit Mission Control during STS-2 that November.|$|E
5|$|When Reid took office, Alberta was {{experiencing}} the Great Depression. Reid took measures to ease Albertans' suffering, but believed that inducing a full economic <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> beyond {{the capacity of}} the provincial government. In this climate, Alberta voters were attracted to the economic theories of evangelical preacher William Aberhart, who advocated a version of social credit. Despite Reid's claims that Aberhart's proposals were economically and constitutionally unfeasible, Social Credit routed the UFA in the 1935 election; Reid's party did not retain a single seat. Reid lived forty-five years after his defeat, but these years were spent in obscurity; he never returned to political life.|$|E

5|$|A key {{criticism}} of the Act {{at the time as}} well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with that type of market failure. Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and monopolies. One of the economic effects of monopoly and cartels is higher prices—this was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929–33 had depressed prices 20% and more. There is anecdotal evidence that these higher prices led to some stability in industry, but a number of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> inhibited. But other economists disagree, pointing to far more important monetary, budgetary, and tax policies as contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression. Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and that the effect on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} three hundred years, Delhi was ruled by a {{succession}} of Turkic and an Afghan, Lodhi dynasty. They built several forts and townships {{that are part of}} the seven cities of Delhi. Delhi was a major centre of Sufism during this period. The Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi) was overthrown in 1290 by Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji (1290–1320). Under the second Khalji ruler, Ala-ud-din Khalji, the Delhi sultanate extended its control south of the Narmada River in the Deccan. The Delhi sultanate reached its greatest extent during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughluq (1325–1351). In an attempt to bring the whole of the Deccan under control, he moved his capital to Daulatabad, Maharashtra in central India. However, by moving away from Delhi he lost control of the north and was forced to return to Delhi to restore order. The southern provinces then broke away. In the years following the reign of Firoz Shah Tughlaq (1351–1388), the Delhi sultanate rapidly began to lose its hold over its northern provinces. Delhi was captured and sacked by Timur Lenk in 1398, who massacred 100,000 captives. Delhi's decline continued under the Sayyid dynasty (1414–1451), until the sultanate was reduced to Delhi and its hinterland. Under the Afghan Lodhi dynasty (1451–1526), the Delhi sultanate recovered control of the Punjab and the Gangetic plain to once again achieve domination over Northern India. However, the <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> short-lived and the sultanate was destroyed in 1526 by Babur, founder of the Mughal dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{citizens}} left homeless by Omar {{resided in}} a tent city nicknamed Camp Omar, consisting of 200tents holding more than 1,000people. Volunteers and military efforts cleaned most of the debris on the island within a few weeks. Many important roads were reopened by {{three days after the}} storm. The power took four weeks to be restored island-wide, disrupting schools and businesses, although water access was expected to be restored within a few days of the storm. Schools reopened on September 14, and most businesses resumed their work {{by the end of the}} month. The United States military ceased relief operations on September 19, though complete <b>recovery</b> <b>was</b> disrupted by the passage of several subsequent typhoons. These storms caused less damage than normal after Omar wrecked the more vulnerable structures. As a result, it became difficult to discern the damage between Omar and Typhoon Gay in December 1992. A 1993 study in the medical journal Anxiety found that 7.2% of 320 participants affected by Omar developed acute stress reaction, and another 15% developed early traumatic stress response, especially those affected by the later typhoons. About 5.9% of the participants displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, similar to the levels shown after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.|$|E
