5|$|During the 1934–35 offseason, Ruth {{circled the}} world with his wife; the trip {{included}} a barnstorming tour of the Far East. At his final stop in the United Kingdom before returning home, Ruth was introduced to cricket by Australian player Alan Fairfax, and after having little luck in a cricketer's stance, stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field, destroying the bat in the process. Although Fairfax regretted {{that he could not}} have the time to make Ruth a cricket player, <b>Ruth</b> <b>had</b> lost any interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.|$|E
5|$|The storyline {{continued}} to play out over the following months as <b>Ruth</b> <b>had</b> her mastectomy operation, began a slow process of recovery and came to terms with her new appearance. When Ruth's chemotherapy treatment began during the Autumn months, David, Heather and close friend Usha (Souad Faress) were {{a constant source of}} support and comfort to her. Following her last course of chemotherapy, Ruth returned to work on the farm and was later given the all clear. In 2002, Ruth became pregnant and gave birth to her third child, Ben (Thomas Lester).|$|E
5|$|In Game1, Herb Pennock {{pitched the}} Yankees to a 2–1 {{win over the}} Cards. In Game2, pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander evened the Series for St. Louis with a 6–2 victory. Knuckleballer Jesse Haines' shutout in Game3 gave St. Louis a 2–1 Series lead. In the Yankees' 10–5 Game4 win, Babe Ruth hit three home runs, a World Series record equaled only four times since. According to {{newspaper}} reports, <b>Ruth</b> <b>had</b> promised a sickly boy named Johnny Sylvester to {{hit a home run}} for him in Game4. After Ruth's three-homer game, the boy's condition miraculously improved. The newspapers' account of the story is disputed by contemporary baseball historians, but it {{remains one of the most}} famous anecdotes in baseball history. Pennock again won for the Yankees in Game5, 3–2.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions {{at one time or another}} (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. <b>Ruth</b> <b>had</b> become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} April 1920, the Yankees were 4–7, {{with the}} Red Sox leading the league with a 10–2 mark. <b>Ruth</b> <b>had</b> done little, having injured himself {{swinging}} the bat. Both situations began to change on May 1, when Ruth hit a tape measure home that sent the ball {{completely out of the}} Polo Grounds, a feat believed to have been previously accomplished only by Shoeless Joe Jackson. The Yankees won, 6–0, taking three out of four from the Red Sox. Ruth hit his second home run on May 2, {{and by the end of}} the month had set a major league record for home runs in a month with 11, and promptly broke it with 13 in June. Fans responded with record attendance figures. On May 16, Ruth and the Yankees drew 38,600 to the Polo Grounds, a record for the ballpark, and 15,000 fans were turned away. Large crowds jammed stadiums to see Ruth play when the Yankees were on the road.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, {{she married}} a man named Frank (his surname is unknown), {{and they had a}} {{daughter}} two years later. The couple divorced in the early 1920s; Frank gained custody of their daughter, although <b>Ruth</b> <b>had</b> access as well. Little is known for certain about Ruth's life from the mid-1920s to the 1940s, but she worked in a variety of jobs. She held positions in several restaurants and also worked as a model, real-estate broker, resort manager, and nanny. In the 1940s, she enrolled at the Church of Religious Science, where she studied New Thought under Ernest Holmes, and was separately introduced to psychic healing in that decade. Over time, she also became interested in spiritualism, channeling, and past-life regression. She married Benjamin Arnold in the 1940s; the marriage lasted until his death in 1951. Two years later, she remarried and settled in Lancaster, California. Her third husband, George Marian, owned a milk-delivery business which Ruth helped him to manage. In the mid-1950s, she became interested in acting and earned the starring role in a local play.|$|E

5|$|McNicoll relinquished {{command of}} HMAS Australia in July 1954 before the cruiser was paid off and marked for {{disposal}} the following month, and he briefly returned to duties at the Navy Office. In November, he embarked for London {{to attend the}} Imperial Defence College {{as part of the}} 1955 course intake, which signified that he had been marked for senior command. McNicoll and his wife, <b>Ruth,</b> <b>had</b> separated in 1950 and their divorce, which cited adultery as the cause, was finalised in October 1956, while the former was still in London. On 17 May the following year, McNicoll wed Frances Mary Chadwick, a journalist, in the Hampstead register office. Made acting rear admiral in January 1957, McNicoll was appointed as Head of the Australian Joint Service Staff in London. He returned to Australia in February 1958 and was selected to serve as Deputy Secretary (Military) at the Department of Defence; McNicoll's rank was made substantive in July that year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ruth</b> <b>had</b> {{two hits}} {{in the second game}} of the season, but it quickly went {{downhill}} both for him and the Braves from there. The season soon settled down to a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all, and the Braves lost most of their games. As April passed into May, Ruth's physical deterioration became even more pronounced. While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so poor that he could barely trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie that they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well. He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice. For his part, McKechnie later said that Ruth's huge salary and refusal to stay with the team while on the road made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline.|$|E
25|$|In {{an update}} to Glory Denied, Tom Philpott {{reported}} that Alyce Thompson {{died of cancer}} in 2009.

Philpott reported that <b>Ruth</b> <b>had</b> told him the strength of character that she inherited from both her parents had helped her though the difficult times. Glory Denied was later turned into an opera.|$|E

25|$|Ruth {{came close}} to being fired after admitting that she didn't read the task rules and thought they were being {{measured}} on turnover rather than profit, combined with her consistent attempts to blame Syed for the whole task, but Sir Alan decided that Syed was more deserving of being fired, since <b>Ruth</b> <b>had</b> been a much stronger contributor in the tasks and had a better CV.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{mishandling}} {{the sales}} with Philip Green, Sir Alan felt that Ruth {{was not to}} blame for the loss as she had been the top seller on her team, criticising Michelle for bringing her back when both her errors and those of Sam outweighed Ruth's single mistake. However, Michelle said she had even less reason to bring Ansell in, since both he and <b>Ruth</b> <b>had</b> sold well, and that Ruth's handling of Green was the sole fault she could find in either performance.|$|E
