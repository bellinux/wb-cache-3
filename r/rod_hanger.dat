25|$|The {{suspension}} cables must be anchored at {{each end}} of the bridge, since any load applied to the bridge is transformed into a tension in these main cables. The main cables continue beyond the pillars to deck-level supports, and further continue to connections with anchors in the ground. The roadway is supported by vertical suspender cables or <b>rods,</b> called <b>hangers.</b> In some circumstances, the towers may sit on a bluff or canyon edge where the road may proceed directly to the main span, otherwise the bridge will usually have two smaller spans, running between either pair of pillars and the highway, which may be supported by suspender cables or may use a truss bridge to make this connection. In the latter case there will be very little arc in the outboard main cables.|$|R

The {{measurement}} {{accuracy of the}} cable tensions in the <b>hanger</b> <b>rods</b> of concrete filled steel tube arch bridges {{is important for the}} correct evaluation of bridges condition. Based on Jinpan Bridge-a half through concrete filled steel tube arch bridge with 80 m span in Tiantai, it was put forward the vibration frequency method for testing and evaluate suspender tensions with the help of analysis vibration characters of the suspender. The precision of cable force calculation formula was verified after comparing the practical tension with the designed tension obtained from tension jack method. Then, according to the test results and values predicted by the presented cable force calculation formula, the cable tensions were adjusted. Cable tension test results in the finished bridge show that this method is feasible...|$|R

The research team used externally-mounted accelerometers to monitor the free vibration of each hanger during all incremental construction stages {{as well as one}} year after completion. The acceleration records for each hanger were analyzed using a fast fourier transform (FFT) to calculate the natural frequency of several modes of vibration. These natural frequencies were then used to estimate the tensile force in each hanger considering both taut-string theory and the flexural stiffness of the steel <b>hanger</b> <b>rod.</b> The results of this work show the value of structural monitoring during construction and indicat...|$|R
2500|$|The covered bridges in Lancaster County are all {{built of}} similar {{construction}} and appearance. [...] Some {{of this is}} {{because many of the}} existing bridges were built by the same man, Elias McMellen, who built 12 of the existing bridges. [...] The most common construction method used was that of the Burr arch truss. [...] It is found in its single and double span forms in almost all of the covered bridges in the county, except for the Landis Mill Covered Bridge, a multiple kingpost design. [...] The Pine Grove Covered Bridge and Herr's Mill Covered Bridge are the county's only double span covered bridges. [...] While most of the bridges are situated in remote locations where there is limited traffic, a number of the bridges, such as Jackson's Sawmill Covered Bridge, were later reinforced with steel beams underneath the bridge floor and steel <b>hanger</b> <b>rods</b> on the sides to support heavier traffic or give the bridge additional support.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of structural materials and sensor technology has impacted the bridge industry by improving the robustness {{of the highway}} network and providing behavior based condition assessments. During the last decades, conventional materials have been supplemented with state-of-the-art materials (e. g., carbon and fiber based, ultra-high performance concrete, etc.). The {{evolution of}} smart or intelligent structures by incorporating systems to quantify performance will continue to revolutionize the bridge industry. While laboratory and field applications have indicated that smart materials are appropriate for bridge applications, additional investigations regarding sensor installation, deployment and data reduction are still needed. The work described herein {{is a collection of}} field and laboratory tests in which sensors were applied to verify structural and material behavior and develop smart members for integration as part of a structural health monitoring system for bridge superstructures. Three projects are presented in which new materials and unique structures were evaluated using specialized sensors and monitoring techniques. Two basket-handle arch pedestrian bridges with high-strength steel <b>hanger</b> <b>rods</b> supporting a pre-cast, post-tensioned concrete panel deck system were monitored to prevent deck cracks {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>hanger</b> <b>rods.</b> Fiber optic sensors and externally mounted accelerometers were attached to the <b>hanger</b> <b>rods</b> to indirectly determine the tensile forces during incremental construction stages and in service conditions. For the second project, a three-span prestressed concrete (PC) girder, composite deck bridge was monitored and evaluated. One end span consisted of composite FRP deck panels and was compared to the opposite cast-in-place reinforced concrete deck end span. Strategically placed transducers measured strain levels on the PC girders and the FRR panels from controlled live and ambient traffic loadings to determine the degree of composite action, load distribution, and maximum in-service strains. A FRP panel temporary bypass bridge was evaluated as a replacement to typical steel temporary bridges as part of the third project. The research focused on the design, fabrication, construction and load testing of this state-of-the-art bridge. This bridge was instrumented with transducers for measuring deflections and loaded with a static truck at pertinent locations to evaluate its performance. A five year research plan was established to develop a conceptual smart timber bridge made of glued laminated (glulam) stringers and a transverse glulam deck. Both stock and custom fiber optic sensor packages were implemented to quantify the structural response. The first of multiple phases of this national five year plan includes the development of an efficient structural health monitoring system and a smart timber bridge field demonstration. To support these goals, two types of FBG sensors packages were developed, the first evaluated the structural strain response and the second isolated the sensor from mechanical strain for detecting deterioration parameters (e. g., moisture content, corrosion, wood deterioration, etc.). Techniques were developed for embedding and attaching the FBG sensor packages to glulam specimens. Small scale specimens were instrumented with the custom FBG sensor packages and tested under a range of temperature and loading conditions to determine sensor viability. A full scale glulam beam was instrumented with similar FBG sensor packages to demonstrate applicability and evaluate performance at service level proportions. From this work, the following contributions in structural bridge monitoring were added to the state-of-the-art: *	Application of FBG sensors and accelerometers to monitor the structural behavior of a bridge during construction. *	Applied testing of non-traditional FRP deck panels to validate composite action. *	Initial development of a smart timber bridge structural health monitoring system. *	Development of FBG sensor packages for implementation in glulam members as part of a smart timber bridge...|$|R
5000|$|In Japan, {{tied arch}} bridges with {{crossing}} hangers are wrongly called Nielsen-Lohse bridge.Engineer Octavius F. Nielsen {{applied for a}} patent on tied arches with inclined <b>hanger</b> <b>rods</b> in 1926. This bridge type was then built about 60 times, primarily in Sweden. None of these bridges had crossed hangers. [...] Lohse bridges have a tie conversely curved to the arch. The bridge deck {{is supported by a}} third structural element hanging underneath. They are named for the German engineer Hermann Lohse (1815 - 1893) who developed them in the late 19th century. Thus, it can be recognised that the name Nielse-Lohse is not correct for tied arches with inclined hanger crossing each other multiple times. Furthermore, the archetype of the Japanese network arches is the Fehmarnsund Bridge, Germany, which itself is based on the network arch idea. [...] The correct name of tied arch bridges with inclined hangers that cross each other at most once is Nielsen bridge. Tied arches with hangers with multiple intersections are network arch bridges. This strict rule is justified, because it leads to a more efficient structure.|$|R

The research identifies the capacity characteristics of a hospital piping system with and without bracings as well as the system’s weak points.

Background The functioning of an essential facility, such as a hospital, after an earthquake relies heavily on proper functioning of its nonstructural components such as fire suppression and water distribution systems, elevators and medical equipment. In recent earthquakes, nonstructural components in hospitals and medical buildings have suffered a large amount of damage, which resulted in a significant reduction of the functionality of the facilities. The 1971 San Fernando Earthquake caused severe damage to many hospitals and medical facilities. As a result of that damage, four of the 11 damaged medical facilities in the area had to be evacuated (Wasilewski 1998). Due to this unacceptable performance, the State of California passed the Hospital Seismic Safety Act, which required that medical facilities be designed and built to remain operational after an earthquake event (Ayres and Phillips, 1998). The California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) was charged with certifying that bracing components installed in California hospitals met a certain level of strength...|$|R
