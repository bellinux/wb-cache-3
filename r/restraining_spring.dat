40|$|Zinc-alloyed cadmium {{telluride}} (Zn:CdTe) crystals were grown in unit gravity and in microgravity for comparative analysis. Two crystals were grown on USML- 1 /STS- 50 in 1992, and two additional crystals were grown on USML- 2 /STS- 73 in 1995. The Crystal Growth Furnace (CGF) in the seeded Bridgman-Stockbarger crystal growth geometry was utilized on both missions. Crystals grown on USML- 1 /STS- 50 {{were found to}} have solidified with partial wall contact due to the near-absence of the hydrostatic pressure in microgravity, a residual g-vector that was not axial, and the nonwetting sample/ampoule wetting conditions. Crystals grown on USML- 2 /STS- 73 included: a sample/ampoule identical to the USML- 1 /STS- 73 sample/ampoule, {{with the addition of a}} <b>restraining</b> <b>spring</b> to simulate hydrostatic pressure internally, and a tapered ampoule which accomplished 2. 2 cm of crystal growth without wall contact. Infrared transmission of all ground and flight samples was found to be 63 - 66 percent, very close to the theoretical 66 percent, suggesting good stoichiometric control. Infrared microscopy confirmed that the primary precipitates were Te and their size (1 - 10 microns) and density suggested that the flight- and ground-base samples experienced similar thermal histories. Longitudinal macrosegregation, calculated using scaling analysis, was predicted to be low. Nearly diffusion controlled growth was achieved even in unit gravity and macrosegregation data could be fit with a diffusion controlled model. Radial segregation was monitored and was found to vary with fraction solidified, particularly through the shoulder region, where the sample cross section was varying significantly. It was also disturbed in the flight samples in regions where asymmetric wall contact was noted. In regions where a steady state was established, the radial segregation was invariant within our experimental measurement error. Flight samples were found to be much higher in structural perfection than samples processed in unit gravity under identical growth conditions. In regions where solidification had occurred without wall contact, the free surfaces evidenced virtually no twinning, although twins appeared in the flight samples in regions of wall contact and were pervasive in the ground samples. These results were confirmed using optical microscopy and synchrotron x-ray white beam topography. Full-width half-maximum rocking curve widths (FWHM), recorded in arc-seconds, were significantly reduced from 20 a-s (1 g) to 9 a-s (micro-g) for the best regions of the crystals. The 9 a-s (FWHM) rocking curve value in the unconfined flight samples equals the best value reported terrestrially for this material. The ground samples exhibited a fully developed (111) [110] dislocation mosaic structure, whereas dislocations within the flight samples were discrete and no mosaic structure was evident. The defect density was quantitatively reduced from 75, 000 (1 g) to 800 (micro-g) +/- 50 percent. Dislocation etch pit density results were confirmed using transmission synchrotron white beam and monochromated beam topography. The low defect density is thought to have resulted from the near absence of hydrostatic pressure, which allowed the molten boule to solidify with little or no wall contact. This minimized the transfer of hoop stresses during solidification and post-solidification processing...|$|E

The analytical {{model of a}} cantilever beam that include the time delayed displacement term along with two <b>restrained</b> <b>spring</b> forces {{has been used to}} model the flexible tube. The model consists of one loose support placed at the free end of the beam and the other at the mid-span of the beam. The critical flow has been obtained after solving a free vibration model of the system. The beam equation is discretized to five second order delay differential equations using Galerkin approximation, and solved numerically. It has been found that, for ow velocity less than the critical ow velocity the system shows a positive damping leading to a stable response. Beyond the critical velocity, the system becomes unstable, but a further increase in the velocity leads to the formation a negative damping which stabilize the system at an amplified oscillatory state. For a sufficiently high ow velocity the tube impacts on the loose supports and generates more complex and chaotic vibrations. The loose supports have been modelled as a cubic spring and a tri-linear spring. The effect of spring constants and free-gap of the loose support on the dynamics of the tube has been studied...|$|R

Measurements were made with the landing gear retracted for full and empty fuel conditions. The equipment, which consisted primarily of knife—edge supports and <b>restraining</b> <b>springs</b> for the pitch and roll axes and a single—shaft torsional pendulum for the yaw axis, was designed for increased accuracy as well as for simplicity of operation and ease of handling as compared with previous methods. At no time was it necessary to hoist or jack the airplane in an abnormal fashion. Analysis showed the maximum possible error of the inertia measure-ments to be ± 1. 7, ± 1. 2, and ± 0. 6 percent of the true moments of inertia about the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively. For each suspension system, measured moments of inertia of known masses of simple form agreed within 0. 5 percent with the calculated values. The results of brief tests have indicated that suitable application of the torsional pendulum would permit evaluation of the inclination of the principal axes to within less than ± 0. 1 °, which corresponds to an error of less than ± 35 slug-feet squared in the product of inertia of the test airplane...|$|R

The moment of inertia results were satisfactory, but difficulty was found in determining the product of inertia due to unsatisfactory design of the single point suspension rig. A dependence of roll period on roll amplitude was discovered {{and this may be}} due to some form of ground effect. The damping in roll was found to vary with fuel state. The agreement between the manufacturer's estimates and the measured moments and product of inertia was poor, and there is clearly a continuing need for inertia measurements. Simple estimates of the fuel inertias compared well with the measured values, agreement being within the expected accuracy of the measurements.

[...] The [...] Mathis G.7R seven-cylinder radial engine was immediately behind them, with its crankshaft vertical; the Norélic was the first French helicopter with its engine in this orientation. The driveshaft rose through the fuselage to the rotor hub, which was slightly offset forwards on a two side-by-side pillar, faired support. The Norélic had a two-blade articulated rotor with undamped flapping hinges; the blades had the same chord and aerofoil from hub to tip and were each built around a single solid spar with ribs and a thin metal skin, all clamped together. Blade pitch was automatically controlled by small servo or pilot airfoils mounted on rods at right-angles to the rotors. Though reminiscent of the servos on the Hiller 360, those on the Norélic were themselves flappable and were intended to control both cyclic pitch and the flapping amplitude of the main rotors. Thus the cockpit cyclic pitch control was absent, and instead roll was produced by sideways motion of the hub via its parallel support pillars, which separated the centres of lift and gravity. Effects due to variations in the position of the centre of gravity could be trimmed out by longitudinal movements of the hub. The servo blades also served as rotor speed governors; <b>restrained</b> by <b>springs,</b> they could slide outward as the rotor speed began to increase, increasing the pitch and the associated drag to decrease the speed. Collective pitch was thus primarily determined by throttle setting, though there was a collective pitch override lever.|$|R

The results presented are for a series of calculations on an idealised system having degrees of freedom in wing pitch, rotation of the control surface and rotation of the tab; the pitching degree of freedom is <b>spring</b> <b>restrained</b> and is intended to represent wing torsion. The tab is restrained as a trim tab or pure aerodynamic servo tab, but the results are expected to apply qualitatively to a spring tab. A comparison is made between these results and those of earlier investigations into a similar problem by Wittmeyerand Wittmeyer and Templeton-, where the main surface mode considered was one of vertical translation to represent wing bending. From this previous work criteria were suggested for the prevention of this type of flutter, and in an analogous manner criteria are now tentatively proposed for prevention of wing torsion-aileron-tab flutter. 1.

40|$|As a {{helicopter}} transitions from hover to forward flight, the main rotor blades experience an asymmetry in flow field around the azimuth, with the blade section tangential velocities increasing on the advancing side and decreasing on the retreating side. To {{compensate for the}} reduced dynamic pressure on the retreating side, the blade pitch angles over {{this part of the}} rotor disk are increased. Eventually, a high enough forward speed is attained to produce compressibility effects on the advancing side of the rotor disk and stall on the retreating side. The onset of these two phenomena drastically increases the rotor vibratory loads and power requirements, thereby effectively establishing a limit on the maximum achievable forward speed. The alleviation of compressibility and stall (and the associated decrease in vibratory loads and power) would potentially result in an increased maximum forward speed. In the past, several methods have been examined and implemented to reduce the vibratory hub loads. Some of these methods are aimed specifically at alleviating vibration at very high flight speeds and increasing the maximum flight speed, while others focus on vibration reduction within the conventional flight envelope. Among the later are several types passive as well as active schemes. Passive schemes include a variety of vibration absorbers such as mechanical springs, pendulums, and bifilar absorbers. These mechanism are easy to design and maintain, but incur significant weight and drag penalties. Among the popular active control schemes in consideration are Higher Harmonic Control (HHC) and Individual Blade Control (IBC). HHC uses a conventional swash plate to generate a multi-cyclic pitch input to the blade. This requires actuators capable of sufficiently high power and bandwidth, increasing the cost and weight of the aircraft. IBC places actuators in the rotating reference frame, requiring the use of slip rings capable of transferring enough power to the actuators. Both schemes cause an increase in pitch link loads. Trailing Edge Flap (TEF) deployment can also used to generate unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments that counter the original vibratory loads, and thereby reduce rotor vibrations. While the vibrations absorbers, HHC, IBC, and TEF concepts discussed above attempt to reduce the vibratory loads, they do not specifically address the phenomena causing the vibrations at high advance ratios. One passive method that attempts to directly alleviate compressibility and stall, instead of reducing the ensuing vibrations, is the use of advanced tip designs. Taper, sweep, anhedral, and the manipulation of other geometric properties of the blade tips can reduce the severity of stall and compressibility effects, as well as reduce rotor power. A completely different approach to solve these problems is the tiltrotor configuration. As the forward velocity of the aircraft increases, the rotors, in this case, are tilted forward until they are perpendicular to the flow and act as propellers. This eliminates the edgewise flow encountered by conventional rotors and circumvents all the problems associated with flow asymmetry. However, the success involves a tremendous increase in cost and complexity of the aircraft. Another possible approach that has been proposed for the alleviation of vibratory loads at high forward flight speeds involves the use of controlled lead-lag motions to reduce the asymmetry in flow. A correctly phased 1 /rev controlled lag motion could be introduced such that it produces a backward velocity on the advancing side and a forward velocity on the retreating side, to delay compressibility effects and stall to a higher advance ratio. Using a large enough lead-lag amplitude, the tip velocities could be reduced to levels encountered in hover. This concept was examined by two groups in the 1950 's and early 1960 's. In the United States, the Research Labs Division of United Aircraft developed a large lead-lag motion rotor, meant to achieve lag motion amplitudes up to 45 degrees. In order to reduce the required actuation force, the blade hinges were moved to 40 % of the blade radius to increase the rotating lag frequency to approximately 1 /rev. The blade hinges were redesigned to produce a flap-lag coupling so the large flapwise aerodynamic loads could be exploited to actuate the blades in the lag direction. A wind tunnel test of this rotor concept revealed actuation and blade motion scheduling problems. The project was eventually discontinued due to these problems and high blade stresses. Around the same time, at Boelkow in Germany, a similar lead-lag rotor program was conducted under the leadership of Hans Derschmidt. Here, too, the blade hinges were moved outboard to 34 % radius to reduce the actuation loads. The main difference between this and the United Aircraft program was the use of a mechanical actuation scheme with maximum lead-lag motions of 400. This program was also discontinued for unclear reasons. The present study is directed toward conducting a comprehensive analytical examination {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} controlled lead-lag motions in reducing vibratory hub loads and increasing maximum flight speed. Since both previous studies on this subject were purely experimental, only a limited data set and physical understanding of the problem was obtained. With the currently available analytical models and computational resources, the present effort is geared toward developing an in-depth physical understanding of the precise underlying mechanisms by which vibration reduction may be achieved. Additionally, in recognition of the fact that large amplitude lead-lag motions would - (i) be difficult to implement, and (ii) produce very large blade stresses; the present study examines the potential of only moderate-to-small lead-lag motions for reduction of vibratory hub loads. Using such an approach, the emphasis is not on eliminating the periodic variations in tangential velocity at the blade tip, but at best reducing these variations slightly so that compressibility and stall are delayed to slightly higher advance ratios. This study was conducted in two steps. In the first step, a hingeless helicopter rotor was modeled using rigid blades undergoing flap-lag-torsion rotations about <b>spring</b> <b>restrained</b> hinges and bearings. This model was then modified by separating the lead-lag degree of freedom into two components, a free and a prescribed motion. Using this model, a parametric study of the effect of phase and amplitude of a prescribed lead-lag motion on hub vibration was conducted. The data gathered was analyzed to obtain an understanding of the basic physics of the problem and show the capability of this method to reduce vibration and expand the flight envelope. In the second half of the study, the similar analysis was conducted using an elastic blade model to confirm the effects predicted by the simpler model...|$|R
