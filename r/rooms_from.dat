5|$|A thermæ and caravanserai of {{the same}} period were also found, and {{is similar to the}} thermæ at Ashkelon and others in the nearby country. A row of <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> an earlier, 1st century BCE to 1st century CE {{fortress}} revealed artefacts pointing to a Nabatæan occupation predating Roman annexation. Coins bearing the likeness of Nabatæan kings were found, along with storage jars and other vessels.|$|E
5|$|Both of the {{targeted}} airfields contained sector operations <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> which the British fighters were directed into action. These airfields were {{selected by the}} Luftwaffe {{because they were the}} largest ones known to be operating RAF fighters. The German intelligence had no knowledge of the sector operations rooms there. The rooms were above ground and had little protection. If these buildings were to be hit, it would be a serious blow to the control system in the region.|$|E
5|$|Either {{side of the}} Saloon are {{two smaller}} drawing rooms (8, 10), which would {{originally}} have served as private withdrawing <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> the more public activities which would {{have taken place in}} the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of Lord Tyrconnel in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested.|$|E

5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, {{the stadium}} was {{planned to be}} built in three stages, with a {{combined}} budget of NOK156.6 million. The first stage would involve the northern and western sides and cost NOK78.4 million, the second stage would involve the eastern side and cost NOK43.0 million, while the third stage would involve the southern side and cost NOK35.1 million. After construction started, BG changed two specifications, moving public rest <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> the basement to the ground floor, and changing the angle of roof. Both of these gave increased construction costs and alteration of the architectural design plans.|$|E
5|$|This {{was one of}} {{the private}} rooms used by Maria I during her time at Queluz. It is {{designed}} {{in the form of a}} , with a trellis pattern on the ceiling which is reflected in the design of the marquetry floor (illustrated below), giving the impression of being in a pergola rather than an interior. The marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been damaged by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain overdoor and mirror carouches by José Conrado Rosa. Next to the boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from this light and airy room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by William Beckford, who visited the palace in 1794.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his career, Shakespeare divided {{his time}} between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare {{was living in the}} parish of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames. He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same year his company {{constructed}} the Globe Theatre there. By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many fine houses. There, he rented <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of ladies' wigs and other headgear.|$|E
5|$|Following Emery Reves's {{death in}} 1981, the Dallas Museum of Art in the United States {{approached}} Wendy Reves {{knowing that there}} was a possibility that her art collection at La Pausa might be given to a museum. In exchange for the 1985 donation Reves insisted that the museum recreate six of the principal rooms at La Pausa, and display the collection there as she had arranged it. The collection of 1,400 objet d'art is displayed at the museum as the Wendy and Emery Reves Collection in a reconstruction of five <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> La Pausa. The villa's central courtyard and patio were reconstructed at the museum along with the villa's dining room, library, salon, bedroom, and hall, situated in a purpose built 16,500-square-foot wing designed by architect Edward Larrabee Barnes. Wendy Reves also donated $3 million to the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, to establish the Reves Center for International Studies, and directed that the Reves Foundation benefit that college with 40 percent of annual endowment funding. She also chose for herself and her late husband Emery Reves to be buried at William and Mary.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, 1859, he was {{nominated}} as U.S. District Judge for the District of Oregon by President James Buchanan. Two days later the United States Senate confirmed the nomination and Deady received his commission to the court that had been created once Oregon became the 33rd state on February 14, 1859. Deady held the first session of the court on September 12, 1859, in Salem, but had the court relocated to Portland {{by the start of}} the September session of 1860. Deady then moved to Portland where he helped to found the Multnomah County Library. He would serve as president of that organization for a number of years. In Portland, he wrote the articles of incorporation for the city, which became the standard in the state for other cities. At first Portland did not have a courthouse for Deady to use, so he rented two <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> Benjamin Stark on what is now Water Street until a federal courthouse was built beginning in 1869. That courthouse was first named the United States Building, and is now named the Pioneer Courthouse, with Deady moving into the building when it was finished in 1875.|$|E

5|$|Peter {{suddenly}} {{wakes up}} to find himself in the machine in 2011, only one minute since he entered it, and Olivia waiting by his side; concurrently, in the parallel universe, Walternate attempts to convince Fauxlivia to help stop the machine. Peter recalls the memories from the future, and uses the machine to merge the machine <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> both universes into one thus creating a bridge. While Olivia and Walter and their doppelgangers stare each other down, Peter convinces the two sides {{to work together to}} try to repair the damage to save both universes, then suddenly disappears. The Olivias and Walters cautiously agree that they need to put aside their differences to save both worlds, apparently unaware of Peter's disappearance. Outside on Liberty Island in the prime universe, the Observers watch as September (Michael Cerveris) notes to December (Eugene Lipinski) that Peter has already been forgotten by his friends, his purpose having been served, and explains that Peter now never existed.|$|E
5|$|Random dungeons {{were created}} for each {{floor of the}} dungeon by {{selecting}} ten to twenty <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> a pre-built library of 200 layouts, adding in the monsters, items, and other features, and then including fixed rooms that would be found on each floor, such as a boss room and treasure room. In expanding the gameplay, McMillen used the structure of Zeldas dungeons to design how the player would progress through the game. In a typical Zelda dungeon, according to McMillen, the player acquires a new item that helps them to progress farther in the game; he took the same inspiration to assure that each level in Isaac included at least one item and one bonus item on defeating the boss that would boost the character's attributes. McMillen also wanted to encourage players to experiment to learn how things work within Isaac, mirroring how Miyamoto had done with the original Zelda game. He designed the level progression to become more difficult with the player's progression in the game, as well as additional content that became available after beating the game as to make it feel like the game was long. McMillen designed four of the selectable characters based on the main classes of Dungeons & Dragons—fighter, thief, cleric and wizard.|$|E
5|$|The 1828 {{construction}} {{features a}} central hall with three {{rooms on the}} east and west sides of roughly symmetrical construction with chimneys at the intersection of the front and middle rooms. The first floor chimneys were flanked by doors allowing access to the other rooms and storage on the other side. The layout and usage of the jail is not known for certain, but it is believed that the rooms to the west were used by the jailer and his family. The first room as a parlor, the middle as the dining room and the rear room as the kitchen. As part of the renovations in 1959, the Society changed the parlor to a research room, the dining room into a library and added a door to the stairway from the kitchen. The front research room and library retain the original fireplaces, pine floorboards and closets, but the connecting passage between the two rooms were changed to a bathroom. The east side of the jail {{is believed to have been}} used by the jailer for his occupational duties, with the front room as a public reception room and the middle room as his office. The rear room in the back may have been used for record or other storage. After leasing the property, the Society removed the partitions in the rooms that separated the <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> each other.|$|E

5|$|Three days later, Admiral Coligny {{was walking}} back to his <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> the Louvre when a shot rang out from a house and wounded him in the hand and arm. A smoking arquebus was {{discovered}} in a window, but the culprit had made his escape {{from the rear of}} the building on a waiting horse. Coligny was carried to his lodgings at the Hôtel de Béthisy, where the surgeon Ambroise Paré removed a bullet from his elbow and amputated a damaged finger with a pair of scissors. Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.• Frieda, 292. The Duke of Anjou was later reported as saying that he and Catherine had planned the assassination with Anne d'Este, who longed to avenge her husband, Francis, Duke of Guise.• For an overview of historians' various interpretations, see Holt, 83–4. Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.|$|E

25|$|Wolfe {{maintains}} a rigid schedule in the brownstone. He has breakfast {{in his bedroom}} while wearing yellow silk pajamas; he hates to discuss work during breakfast, and if forced to do so insists upon not uttering a word until he has finished his {{glass of orange juice}} (Murder by the Book). Afterwards, he is with Horstmann in the plant <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Lunch is usually at 1:15p.m. He returns to the plant <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Dinner is generally at 7:15 or 7:30p.m. (although in one book, Wolfe tells a guest that lunch is served at 1 o'clock and dinner at 8). The remaining hours, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., and after dinner, are available for business, or for reading if there is no pressing business (even if, by Archie's lights, there is). Sunday's schedule is more relaxed; Theodore, the orchid-keeper, usually goes out.|$|E

25|$|Vale Royal {{was closed}} in 1538 by Henry VIII {{as part of}} the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

Over subsequent centuries this house was considerably altered and extended by successive generations. The building remains habitable and contains surviving <b>rooms</b> <b>from</b> the medieval abbey, including the refectory and kitchen. The foundations of the church and cloister have also been excavated.
