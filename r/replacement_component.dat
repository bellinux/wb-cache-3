Since RCs are used to replace failing, failed, or worn components for in-service vehicles, it is a business {{that is needed to}} support the vehicle for its entire life duration.

40|$|Redundant Arrays of Independent Components (RAIC) is a {{technology}} that uses groups of similar or identical distributed components to provide reliable services to applications [7]. RAIC controllers use the just-in-time component testing technique to detect component failures. RAIC also allows components in a redundant array to be added or removed dynamically at run-time. Component state recovery techniques are used to bring replacement components or newly added components up-to-date. Two types of state recovery techniques are used in RAIC: a snapshot-based approach and an invocation-history-based approach.

We develop a methodology to effectively prepare a predictive maintenance plan of such a system using dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). DBN representation allows monitoring the system reliability in a given planning horizon and predicting the system state under different replacement plans. When the system reliability falls below a predetermined threshold value, component replacements are planned such that maintenance budget is not exceeded. The decision of which component(s) to replace is an important issue since it affects future system reliability and consequently the next time to do <b>replacement.</b> <b>Component</b> marginal probabilities given the system state are used to determine which component(s) to replace. Two approaches are proposed in calculating the marginal probabilities of components. The first is a myopic approach where the only evidence belongs to the current planning time.

In this paper, we consider applying MOEA/D to solve a bi-objective scheduling combinatorial problem in which task durations and due-dates are uncertain. Surprisingly, we find that the conventional MOEA/D implementation provides poor performance in our application setting.

Consequently, we investigate existing variants of MOEA/D and we propose a novel and simple alternative <b>replacement</b> <b>component</b> at the aim of maintaining population diversity.

The maintenance business becomes {{one of the important}} revenue sources for the constructors because profit rate of the maintenance business sometimes becomes much higher than that of new plant construction. To respond this business requirement, a fast automatic path finding system for replacement tasks has been proposed.

That is, the algorithm finds optimal carry-out/carry-in paths for the replacement tasks automatically, by a collision configuration posture map of the <b>replacement</b> <b>component</b> at each point in a carry-out/carry-in path. Since the creation of those maps take a huge number of calculation steps, it is processed by a parallel computing process on GPGPU hardware.

The effect is important for making quantitative deductions from future data, but does not invalidate the use of O 3 as a biomarker for free oxygen.

In the final part we experimentally demonstrate the fact that the rate of oxidative damage has an effect on supramolecular structure of the UHMWPE. From the above experiments are concluded clearly defined recommendations for clinical practice, which should lead to extend the lifespan of total joints replacements in orthopaedics [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally metacommunity {{studies have}} {{quantified}} {{the relative importance}} of dispersal and environmental processes on observed β-diversity. Separating β-diversity into its replacement and nestedness components and linking such patterns to metacommunity drivers can provide richer insights into biodiversity organization across spatial scales. It is often very difficult to measure actual dispersal rates in the field and to define the boundaries of natural metacommunities. To overcome those limitations, we revisited an experimental metacommunity dataset to test the independent and interacting effects of environmental heterogeneity and dispersal on each component of β-diversity. We show that the balance between the replacement and nestedness components of β-diversity resulting from eutrophication changes completely depending on dispersal rates. Nutrient enrichment negatively affected local zooplankton diversity and generated a pattern of β-diversity derived from nestedness in unconnected, environmentally heterogeneous landscapes. Increasing dispersal erased the pattern of nestedness, whereas the <b>replacement</b> <b>component</b> gained importance. In environmentally homogeneous metacommunities, dispersal limitation created community dissimilarity via species replacement whereas the nestedness component remained low and unchanged across dispersal levels. Our study provides novel insights into how environmental heterogeneity and dispersal interact and shape metacommunity structure...|$|E
40|$|To reduce mission risk, long {{duration}} spaceflight {{and exploration}} activities will require greater degrees of self-sufficiency {{with regards to}} repair capability than have ever been employed before in space exploration. The current repair paradigm of replacing Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) of malfunctioning avionics and electronic hardware will be impractical, since carrying all of the spares that could possibly be needed for a long duration mission would require upmass and volume at unprecedented and unacceptable levels. A strategy of component-level repair for electronics, however, could significantly reduce the mass and volume necessary for spares and enhance mission safety via a generic contingency capability. This approach is already used to varying degrees by the U. S. Navy, where vessels at sea experience some similar constraints such {{as the need for}} self sufficiency for moderately long time periods, and restrictions on volume of repair spares and infrastructure. The concept of conducting component-level repairs of electronics in spacecraft requires the development of design guidelines for future avionics (to enable repair), development of diagnostic techniques to allow an astronaut to pinpoint the faulty component aboard a vastly complex vehicle, and development of tools and methodologies for dealing with the physical processes of replacing the component. This physical process includes tasks such as conformal coating removal and <b>replacement,</b> <b>component</b> removal, replacement, and alignment [...] all in the difficulty of a reduced gravity environment. Further, the gravitational effects on the soldering process must be characterized and accounted for to ensure reliability of the newly repaired components. The Component-Level Electronics-Assembly Repair (CLEAR) project under the NASA Supportability program was established to develop and demonstrate the practicality of this repair approach. CLEAR involves collaborative efforts between NASA s Glenn Research Center, Langley Research Center, Johnson Space Center, the National Center for Space Exploration Research, and the U. S. Navy. The project goals are 1) develop and demonstrate a manually-operated electronics repair capability to be conducted in a spacecraft environment; and 2) develop guidelines for designs of electronics that facilitates component-level repair for future space exploration efforts. This multi-faceted program utilizes a cross-disciplinary approach to examine pre- and post-repair diagnostics, conformal coating removal and <b>replacement,</b> <b>component</b> soldering, and electronics design for supportability. These areas are investigated by a combination of trade studies, ground based testing, reduced gravity aircraft testing, and actual spaceflight testing on the International Space Station (ISS) in multiple experiments.

Three amino acids were investigated: alanine (89 g mol- 1), serine (105 g mol- 1), and proline (115 g mol- 1).
