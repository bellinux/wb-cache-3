40|$|This chapter {{examines}} spontaneous {{innovation in}} orangutans using prevalence-based methods for identifying potential innovations in free-ranging populations and comparisons between <b>rehabilitant</b> and wild orangutans. Aims were {{to update the}} list of innovations, validate potential wild innovations, and estimate the innovative processes involved. Findings derive from systematic observations at one wild orangutan site (Tuanan) and four <b>rehabilitant</b> sites plus findings from eight other wild orangutan sites. Wild orangutan evidence identified 56 potential innovations. Validation using <b>rehabilitant</b> data suggests dropping some entries, adding others, and lumping or splitting others. An approximation on what was innovated was made by comparing potential wild innovations with similar species-typical and <b>rehabilitant</b> variants. These comparisons suggest that orangutans innovate by making small extensions to existing skills: combining old skills in new ways, adding a tool, applying old skills to new functions, and changing the items used. All are consistent with findings on great ape intelligence...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{report an}} {{empirical}} study on leaf-carrying, a newly discovered nest-building technique that involves col-lecting nest materials {{before reaching the}} nest site. We as-sessed whether leaf-carrying by <b>rehabilitant</b> orangutans on Kaja Island, Central Kalimantan, owes to cultural influences. Findings derive from ca 600 h observational data on nesting skills and nesting associations in Kaja’s 42 resident rehabili-tants, which yielded 355 nests and 125 leaf-carrying cases by 34 rehabilitants. Regional contrasts with 14 other communi-ties (7 <b>rehabilitant,</b> 7 wild) indicated cultural influences on leaf-carrying on Kaja. Association data showed exceptional social learning opportunities for leaf-carrying on Kaja, with residents taking differential advantage of these opportuni-ties {{as a function of}} development, experience, and social position. Juvenile males with basic nesting skills were most influenced by social input. Most (27) leaf-carriers had proba-bly learned leaf-carrying when caged and 7 probably learned it on Kaja. Social priming was probably the main impetus to leaf-carrying on Kaja, by simply prompting observers to copy when leaf-carrying associates collected nesting mate-rials, what they collected, and where they used their col-lected materials. Implications concern acquisition processes and ontogenetic schedules that orchestrate sets of features— needs or interests, cognitive abilities, social preferences— which enable cultural transmission...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Because of rehabilitants {{with various}} characteristics, {{rehabilitation}} robot must perceive the <b>rehabilitant</b> states(strength and position) and then adopt corresponding training mode and control strategy. So how {{to obtain the}} state of a rehabilitative limb correctly is very significant for a rehabilitation robot during the training. A new method of dynamics parameter identification of limb based on BP (back propagation) artificial neutral network is presented to offer rehabilitation robot dependable information of limb. The simulation results prove that the method of parameter identification can achieve the state of a rehabilitation limb veraciously and robustly. It can suit different rehabilitants {{at different stages of}} rehabilitation even if a spasm happens during training...|$|E
40|$|In a Russian Orthodox Church drug {{rehabilitation}} program in St. Petersburg, drug addiction was {{often described as}} a disease of frozen feelings. This image suggests that rehabilitation {{is a process of}} thawing emotional worlds and, thus, allows the emotions to flow once again. In this article I argue that "frozen feelings" is better understood as the unsocial emotional worlds many drug users experience, and that rehabilitation in this church-run program particularly focuses on the cultivation of an emotional world that supports sociality. This is done, I argue, by means of ethically training <b>rehabilitants</b> to learn how to control and manage their emotional worlds, and in so doing, <b>rehabilitants</b> become new moral persons better able to live in the social world...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the factors which may {{possibly}} explain why rehabilitation agencies' assistance may eventually result in maladjustment [...] a conclusion inferred from recent studies on the readjustment of disabled persons. Multivariate analysis of data from a study among Israeli disabled war veterans ascertains that the <b>rehabilitant's</b> perception of the rehabilitator as pursuing a predominant though latent goal of promoting his/her own interests, constitutes {{a major factor in}} the intervention's detrimental outcomes. The rehabilitator's demonstration of 'affective' (sincerely humane) behavior, on the other hand, counteracts the eventually deleterious consequences. The study renders further support to the frequently emphasized significance of the <b>rehabilitant's</b> subjective assessment of the demands confronting him in their becoming stressors. The data ascertains that it is not the severity of the impairment itself, but rather the subjective assessment of its implication that may have stress-arousing consequences. The present study contributes a further development of the previously established paradigm of 'Readjustment of Disabled Persons', contributing to the understanding of the factors facilitating and impeding readjustment. disability stress rehabilitation professional goals...|$|R
40|$|Employment {{plays an}} {{important}} role within the context of social inclusion. Vocational rehabilitation for people with disabilities is supporting the restoring of labour market inclusion and to ensure it in the long run. But the effects of vocational rehabilitation on labour market integration for people with disabilities are relatively unknown. Contrary to evaluation in the field of medical rehabilitation there is only marginal research here. That applies to participation in measurements or appraisal of the <b>rehabilitants</b> as well as occupational integration after measurements. This article aims to fill in the blank. A survey of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) is used that covers data on vocational <b>rehabilitants</b> with disabilities, who completed a measurement within the German Federal Employment Agency in the year 2006. Thereby the article is focusing on three main measurement groups: 'orientation and training', 'further training and qualification' and 'job creation measures'. The probability of participating on one of these measures is depending on several factors: Age, schooling, vocational education and cumulated unemployment duration as well as regional employment situation. The cumulate duration of illness and the point in time when the disability occurred are also important. Due to their disability the participants appraise their personal benefit differently, regarding on occupational capability or strategies to cope with their disability: Further training and qualification are rated positively, orientation and training are valued more reluctantly and job creation measures were rated lowest. Six months after the measurement the risk of unemployment is higher for those with no school leaving certificate or longer periods of unemployment duration. Besides this, regional aspects play a significant role. Gainful employment is depending on the point in time when disability occurred: <b>rehabilitants</b> whose disability occurred in younger adulthood have a higher chance to be in employment than those with congenital diseases. Living in urban regions and having been employed at least once before rehabilitation also helps getting employed again.

The study focuses on enhancing social connectedness through sharing photos between rehabilitants and their families and friends. Four rehabilitants participated in this study for 6 - 7 weeks. Most photos sent related to sharing things in everyday life and keeping the <b>rehabilitant</b> informed about regular events. The combination of interviews and content analysis reveals that only a minority of the photos lead to follow-up communication about the contents of the photos.

40|$|Hundreds of <b>rehabilitant</b> {{great apes}} have been {{released}} into the wild, and thousands await release. However, survival rates after release can be as low as 20 %. Several factors influence individuals' survival rates, {{one of which is}} the capacity to obtain an adequate diet once released. Released individuals are faced with a mixture of familiar and novel foods in an unfamiliar forest; therefore, {{it is important to understand}} how they increase acceptance and consumption of novel foods. This is especially vital for omnivorous species, such as wild great apes, which consume several hundred species of different foods. We assessed the effects of repeated exposures and sociality (i. e. co-feeding in the presence of one or more other individuals) on the acceptance and consumption of novel foods by captive orangutans (Pongo sp). Repeated exposures of food (novel, at first) did not cause an increase of acceptance of food; in other words, the orangutans did not start to eat a food item after being exposed to that food more often, but repeated exposures of food increased consumption (i. e. quantity). After repeated exposures, the orangutans also became gradually more familiar with the food, decreasing their explorative behaviour. The presence of co-feeding conspecifics resulted in an increased acceptance of the novel food by orangutans, and they ate a larger amount of said foods than when alone. Repeated exposure and sociality may benefit <b>rehabilitant</b> great apes in augmenting and diversifying diet and, once practiced before release, may accelerate an individuals' adaptation to their new habitat, improving survival chances. Great ape rescue, rehabilitation and reintroduction require large financial and logistic investments; however, their effectiveness may be improved at low cost and low effort through the suggested measures...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the factor structure}} of Functional Independence Measure (FIM®) scale amongst people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods. This was a retrospective, register-based cohort study on 155 <b>rehabilitants</b> with SCI. FIM was assessed at the beginning {{and at the end of}} multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation. The internal consistency of the FIM was assessed with Cronbach’s alpha and exploratory factor analysis was employed to approximate the construct structure of FIM. Results. The internal consistency demonstrated high Cronbach’s alpha of 0. 95 to 0. 96. For both pre- and postintervention assessments, the exploratory factor analysis resulted in 3 -factor structures. Except for two items (“walking or using a wheelchair” and “expression”), the structures of the identified three factors remained the same from the beginning to the end of rehabilitation. The loadings of all items were sufficient, exceeding 0. 3. Both pre- and postintervention chi-square tests showed significant p values < 0. 0001. The “motor” domain was divided into two factors with this 2 -factor structure enduring through the intervention period. Conclusions. Amongst <b>rehabilitants</b> with SCI, FIM failed to demonstrate unidimensionality. Instead, it showed a 3 -factor structure that fluctuated only little depending on the timing of measurement. Additionally, when measured separately, also motor score was 2 -dimensional, not 1 -dimensional. Using a total or subscale FIM, scores seem to be unjustified in the studied population...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} capacity of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) to differentiate multi-disabled persons who had become successfully rehabilitated from those who had not. It was expected that the overall MMPI profile of unsuccessful <b>rehabilitants</b> would reflect a greater degree of psychological maladjustment than would the MMPI profile of clients with successful rehabilitation outcomes. Demographic variables were also used to compare a group of successful rehabilitated clients with a group whose cases had been closed unemployed. The subjects were 131 clients who had attended the Minneapolis Rehabilitation Center during a two-year period and whose cases had been closed at least one year. Concerning the comparison of MMPI profiles of the unsuccessful and successful groups of clients, the results indicated that the two profile configurations were "similar.

40|$|People {{have lived}} in a way {{delivering}} many messages through various non-verbal communicative means such as facial expressions and voice tones. Recently, many researchers have attempted to do tasks dealing with emotions conveyed through some immanent bio-signals for human-computer interaction or human-robot interaction.

In this paper, we present a mechanism to do analysis of electroencephalogram signals originated from emotional impulses and to carry out classification of the emotion. Also we have validated the methods to foresee usability for brain-computer interface. The partial derivatives of EEG are taken as features for some training data set gained from facial expression mirroring. Four emotions including neutral, anger, happiness, and surprise have been classified using the support vector machines.

40|$|Field {{studies have}} been, and {{continue}} to be, important contributors {{to the understanding of}} great ape cognition-especially with regard to questions of cognitive ecology or the key cognitive challenges in the evolution of primate intelligence. They are also critical to resolving a current debate, whether human enculturation boosts great apes' cognition, because only studies of problem-solving in feral contexts can resolve the question of whether abilities are higher in enculturated than non-enculturated great apes. To this debate, this paper offers findings from observational field studies on freeranging <b>rehabilitant</b> orangutans' cognitive capabilities, as revealed in their food processing and arboreal positioning, and on the possible social transmission of that expertise. These findings are combined with published findings on wild and enculturated great apes as a basis for assessing the effects of human enculturation on great ape cognition. This assessment joins several others in showing that free-ranging great apes independently achieve cognition of the same order of complexity as enculturated great apes, in concluding that claims for the effects of human enculturation are likely inflated, and in suggesting that the basis for the effectiveness of human enculturation is that great apes normally "enculturate" themselves...|$|E

40|$|To date few studies, {{especially}} among non-human primates, have evaluated or monitored rehabilitation effectiveness and identified key species-specific behavioral indicators for release success. This four-months study aimed to identify behavioral indicators of rehabilitation success among ten infant and juvenile orphaned chimpanzees cared for in peer {{groups at the}} Centre for Conservation of Chimpanzees (CCC), Guinea, West Africa. Behavioral data focused on foraging skills and activity budget. During bush-outings, <b>rehabilitants</b> spent on average {{nearly a quarter of}} their activity budget foraging, resting or traveling, respectively. Neither age, sex, the level of abnormal behaviors demonstrated upon arrival nor human contact during bush-outings predicted individual dietary knowledge. However, individuals who spent more time arboreal demonstrated a greater dietary breadth than conspecifics who dwelled more terrestrially. Although our data failed to demonstrate a role of conspecific observation in dietary acquisition, we propose that the mingling of individuals from different geographical origins may act as a catalyst for acquiring new dietary knowledge, promoted by ecological opportunities offered during bush-outings. This "Super Chimpanzee" theory opens up new questions about cultural transmission and socially-biased learning among our closest living relatives and provides a novel outlook on rehabilitation in chimpanzees...|$|R

40|$|With wild {{spider monkey}} populations in decline, {{investigations}} contributing to captive welfare, and successful rehabilitation and reintroduction knowledge is increasingly pressing. Quantifying and analyzing {{the appropriateness of}} naturalistic enclosure designs to foster species-typical behaviors is {{an effective way to}} address both of these needs. This study investigates enclosure space use, vertical space preference, substrate use, positional/postural modes, and interactions with human caregivers of a wild-caught, pet-trade <b>rehabilitant</b> Columbian black spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps rufiventris, N = 1). Video data collected daily from August to October 2015 via focal animal sampling (from 08 : 00 to 10 : 00) at Alouatta Sanctuary, Panama provided samples for analysis. It was hypothesized that the subject would differentially utilize her enclosure’s vertical space, substrates, positional/postural modes across substrate types, and vary her association with humans over time. Results indicated the subject’s overall use of species-typical locomotive modes did not resemble that of wild populations, but did represent substrate-specific wild locomotive modes. Similarly, the subject’s use of vertical space was significantly affected by {{the presence or absence of}} her human caregivers. This research highlights key points absent in existing literature: the need for enclosures constructed by materials resembling wild substrate-types, and the consideration of caregivers’ influence when rehabilitating New World, arboreal primates...|$|E

We used an eight by one meter pressure sensitive interactive LED floor. With the interactive games we attempted to steer different dimensions of people's gait, increase motivation, provide an enjoying experience, and create an additional platform for gait rehabilitation by physical therapists. We performed several days of exploratory user tests with the created set of games, in total 56 patients and 30 therapists were involved. The set of games was positively received by therapists, who stated they could train a variety of targeted domains with it. Furthermore, many rehabilitants indicated they liked it more than normal training exercises. The possibilities for personalization and the variety of games allowed users {{with a wide variety}} of skills and limitations to train their gait, although not all rehabilitants could be offered an appropriate level of challenge. Nonetheless, we do believe one reason for the positive responses is that the games can be adapted to the rehabilitants' gait characteristics with several settings in the games, and that a second reason seems to be that therapists can choose between games to target different aspects of rehabilitation suitable for the type of <b>rehabilitant...</b>|$|E

This study aimed at determining the demographic, personality and psychopathology characteristic of a sample of runaway girls in Shiraz, Iran. Methods: Fifty girls who had escaped from their home and were referred to the Womens Social Emergency and <b>Rehabilitant</b> Centre of Shiraz were compared with fifty girls who lived with their parents (control group). They were assessed by semi-structured interview based on the DSMIV-TR criteria, demographic questionnaire, the General Health Questionnaire- 28 (GHQ- 28) and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-R- 106 (EPQ-R- 106).

40|$|Background Chronic {{heart failure}} {{requires}} a complex treatment regimen on a life-long basis. Therefore, self-care/self-management {{is an essential}} part of successful treatment and comprehensive patient education is warranted. However, specific information on program features and educational strategies enhancing treatment success is lacking. This trial aims to evaluate a patient-oriented and theory-based self-management educational group program as compared to usual care education during inpatient cardiac rehabilitation in Germany. Methods/Design The study is a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial in four cardiac rehabilitation clinics. Clusters are patient education groups that comprise HF patients recruited within 2 weeks after commencement of inpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Cluster randomization was chosen for pragmatic reasons, i. e. to ensure a sufficient number of eligible patients to build large-enough educational groups and to prevent contamination by interaction of patients from different treatment allocations during rehabilitation. <b>Rehabilitants</b> with chronic systolic heart failure (n[*]=[*] 540) will be consecutively recruited for the study at the beginning of inpatient rehabilitation. Data will be assessed at admission, at discharge and after 6 and 12 months using patient questionnaires. In the intervention condition, patients receive the new patient-oriented self-management educational program, whereas in the control condition, patients receive a short lecture-based educational program (usual care). The primary outcome is patients’ self-reported self-management competence. Secondary outcomes include behavioral determinants and self-management health behavior (symptom monitoring, physical activity, medication adherence), health-related quality of life, and treatment satisfaction. Treatment effects will be evaluated separately for each follow-up time point using multilevel regression analysis, and adjusting for baseline values. Discussion This study evaluates the effectiveness of a comprehensive self-management educational program by a cluster randomized trial within inpatient cardiac rehabilitation in Germany. Furthermore, subgroup-related treatment effects will be explored. Study results will contribute to a better understanding of both the effectiveness and mechanisms of a self-management group program as part of cardiac rehabilitation...|$|R
40|$|Play is a {{powerful}} means {{to have an impact}} on the cognitive, social-emotional, and/or motor skills development. The introduction of technology brings new possibilities to provide engaging and entertaining whole-body play activities. Technology mediates the play activities and in this way changes how people play. We can use this to design systems that encourage desired types of behaviors with technology. We systematically investigated new technologically enhanced play applications. We developed several interactive systems, targeting well-founded goals, resulting in the following three systems: 1) an interactive playground platform tracking players and providing an interactive floor projection of about 5 by 5 meters, 2) an interactive ball responding to body movements and sounds with movement, tunes, and lights, and 3) games on an interactive pressure sensitive LED floor. The systems included interactions that steered the in-game play behaviour: a deliberate encouragement of particular types of targeted behavior during game play. We showed we can steer interactive play behavior in different ways: we steered behavior by forcing game rules upon users that would quite certainly change their play behaviour; alternatively, we steered behavior in a more subtle way by enticing players. We postulate that this enticing strategy has several benefits. We compared the systems and interactions to alternatives, often making use of automatic measurements, in order to systematically investigate their effects. To indicate our fondness for this comparative approach we named this intervention based play research. We included various user groups during our research: among others, this included healthy adults/students, children, gait <b>rehabilitants,</b> and people with Profound Intellectual and Multiple Disabilities (PIMD). We showed several opportunities for creating technologically enhanced play activities by addressing this variety of target groups. We saw several reoccurring aspects during our research. It has led us to reiterate the importance of personalization in design and evaluations. One suggestion to address personalization is to have a game-suite approach with adaptable features for each game. Overall, we created a new overview. We combined intervention based play research with steering behaviour and targeting alternative user groups. This points to new suggestions for investigating and implementing interactive play systems...|$|R
40|$|After having {{received}} an in-patient-treatment in a psychosomatic rehabilitation, chronic mentally ill patients need {{to cope with}} their diseases on a long term base. They are confronted with the task to sustain and develop the acquired coping strategies {{as well as to}} integrate them into their everyday life. To support these efforts, rehabilitation clinics recommend follow-up care (e. g. through self-help groups). The project “Online discussion group Seehof” was designed for the rehabilitation center Seehof (DRV), in particular for the department for behavior therapy and psychosomatic medicine. It offers follow-up care independent of time and place by means of internet-based self-help and addresses patients suffering from chronic mental disorders at the time of discharge. An autonomous online discussion forum was planned and set up for the patients (n = 1842) mentioned above, first as a plain self-help service. After one year of use, a second identical online discussion board was set up for a new comparable group of patients (n = 893) also for one year with the difference of adding a forum moderation. The moderator initiated discussion about subjects beneficial to the patients’ health (e. g. coping strategies) and encouraged constructive messages and interaction. This empirical study analyzes the use, the determinants and the effects of the two online self-help groups. Further, it investigates whether there are differences between the two settings in that regard. A set of categories was designed, based on previously developed research questions. It records the occurrence, the extent and the direction (e. g. constructive, destructive) of beneficial topics (e. g. about coping strategies), of beneficial group determinants (e. g. emotional support) and typical characteristics of the communication medium (e. g. anonymity) in the postings of the patients taking part in the discussion groups. The reliability coefficients (Cronbach's alpha) of the categories are between r=. 82 and r=. 95 (with p < 0. 01). Results: In the autonomous online self-help group, 144 (8 %) of 1842 invited patients registered. 46 (32 %) of these registered patients wrote messages. In the moderated group, 76 (8. 5 %) of 893 invited patients registered and 33 of them (ca. 43 %) sent postings. The moderated group thus sent (non significant) more messages than the autonomous group. The participation rate of ca. 8 % of the patients in the online discussion groups was higher compared to the participation rate of only 3 % {{who took part in the}} IRENA follow-up group, which was conducted face-to-face, location- and time-dependent in the rehabilitation center Seehof during the same investigation period of one year. The users of both online self-help groups are comparable in regard to socio-demographic attributes and ICD- 10 -diagnoses (mostly F 1, F 3, F 4 and F 6). The users of the online self-help groups don’t differ from the non-users concerning the ICD- 10 -F-Diagnoses (thus showing typical diagnoses of mentally ill <b>rehabilitants),</b> but compared to the non-users they are significantly younger, mostly female, well-educated, unemployed or working fulltime, having at least a lower, mostly a middle, civil servant or employee status and in the majority of cases have received an in-patient treatment. The users of the online self-help groups participate on average 50 - 60 days in the online discussion forums, post approximately 7 - 15 messages (the amount of postings is a little but not significantly bigger), post mostly anonymously and asychronical at various times of day and evening. They refer interactively to each other, reply significantly more frequent to other patients than writing new messages. Through their postings they create a mainly neutral-positive atmosphere, that is significantly more pronounced in the moderated online forum than in the autonomous one. In both online discussion groups, the patients significantly more address “beneficial topics” than doing small talk. In both online forums, the patients relevantly contributed to build up “beneficial group determinants”. In opposition to the autonomous forum, the moderated forum contained significantly more messages about beneficial topics and significantly more “beneficial determinants” (group cohesion, emotional support and self-disclosure) emerged. Conclusion: The discussions and group determinants mainly focus health issues as well as mutual support and advice. The concept of a “moderated internet forum” is to be favored, in particular as it is more communicative and it more often produces the exchange of beneficial content and processes. The employment of online discussion groups therefore can be regarded as a self-help method and thus as an alternative way of providing rehabilitative follow-up care. It would be desirable to collect further data with respect to cost-benefit-issues and efficacy, in order to be able to assess the therapeutic efficacy of the actions carried out and to justify the technical, organizational and personal effort...|$|R

The inward and outward bound containers to the export processing zones from/to Colombo harbour are considered for this research. The in and out bound containers to the 11 export processing zones over the last year were analyzed to investigate the feasibility of converting transportation to railways since there should be reasonable number of containers necessary to run a freight train in economical manner. IN addition to the emission comparisons cost benefit analysis also carried out in this research. The results revealed that 4 out of 11 export processing zones have necessary quantities of containers which can be transported by railway mode. The level of direct emission reduction out of the transportation is significant and based on indirect factors such as traffic congestions, this value increases further.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{research}} was to determine whether a complete psychological test battery was needed to determine if an individual is capable of successful job placement. If the stated goal of rehabilitation is to produce a successful <b>rehabilitant,</b> perhaps one test, or one subtest, out of the entire psychological battery is as efficient a predictor of success as an entire psychological workup. Thus, more time, money, and manpower can be spent in the rehabilitative process. Success was defined as a client being offered services, accepting such services, completing employment that was in line with the training received and maintaining that employment for a six-month period. Failure was defined as a client completing the entire program of testing, accepting offered services and not completing a program of vocational training. Data for the study was collected from adults who had voluntarily come to regional offices of the Indiana Division of Vocational Rehabilitation between the years 1979 and 1982. Statistical analyses were done on 199 clients. Most of the 199 rehabilitants were given the following battery of tests: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Wide Range Achievement Test, Peabody Individual Achievement Test, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Self Directed Search or StrongCampbell Interest Inventory. It was decided not to use the Peabody Individual Achievement Test or the Strong Campbell Interest Inventory because they limited sample size. The psychometric data were all post hoc. They were analyzed by a Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and by Stepwise Regression. References were considered statistically significant at the. 05 level. F at 1, 200 degrees of freedom was 3. 80. The Wide Range Achievement Test, subtest 4 (spelling grade level) was significant in best predicting success at the. 05 level with an F score of 5. 04524. The S scale (social interest) in the Self Directed Search was the next significant subtest in predicting success at the. 05 level with an F score of 4. 78224. The C scale (conventional) in the Self Directed Search was the next significant in best predicting success at the. 05 level, with an F score of 6. 17417. The best multiple predictors of success are subtest 4 of the WRAT (F, 4. 956) combined with S (F, 10. 900) and C (F, 8. 588) scales of the SDS. The F level or tolerance level was insufficient for further computation. Thesis (Ph. D. ...|$|E
