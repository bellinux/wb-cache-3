25|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> (RF remote control) is used {{to control}} distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the remote control device. As a complementary method to infrared remote controls, the <b>radio</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most remote controls use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal remote control duplicator because it is able to copy existing remote controls, while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any remote control in the market.|$|E
25|$|A <b>radio</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> system {{commonly}} has two parts: transmit and receive. The transmitter part {{is divided}} into two parts, the RF remote control and the transmitter module. This allows the transmitter module {{to be used as a}} component in a larger application. The transmitter module is small, but users must have detailed knowledge to use it; combined with the RF remote control it is much simpler to use.|$|E
500|$|To {{haul the}} trains, the mining company took {{delivery}} of a Vossloh G1000 BB. Built new in 2009, it was delivered to Kirkenes on 12 February 2010. The unit deviates from standard production by having its maximum speed reduced by software from it is further equipped with snowploughs, air supply to open the hopper car doors, <b>radio</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> and janney couplers. As a back-up, the company will retain the MaK G 1203. The old hooper cars were renovated and put into service, while the track received new concrete ties. The train runs up to 20 trips per day.|$|E

25|$|Electronic devices {{operated}} by infrared <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> can interpret the infrared light emitted by CFLs as a signal; this may limit {{the use of}} CFLs near televisions, <b>radios,</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> or mobile phones. Energy Star certified CFLs must meet FCC standards, and so are required to list all known incompatibilities on the package.|$|R
50|$|The first two-way <b>radio</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> {{utilized}} {{a harness}} of wires extending speaker, microphone, and controls for options such as channel selection or CTCSS switches.

2500|$|Outdoor {{autonomy}} is {{most easily}} {{achieved in the}} air, since obstacles are rare. Cruise missiles are rather dangerous highly autonomous robots. Pilotless drone aircraft are increasingly used for reconnaissance. Some of these unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of flying their entire mission without any human interaction at all except possibly for the landing where a person intervenes using <b>radio</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control.</b> Some drones are capable of safe, automatic landings, however. [...] An autonomous ship was announced in 2014—the Autonomous spaceport drone ship—and is scheduled to make its first operational test in December 2014.|$|E

The prime mover is still present to provide emergency power in case of an electricity outage. There are two trains in operation, theoretically a third train could be operated. Each train consist of 21 coal hoppers. Both trains make typically 12 round trips a day in a 24 hour operation. There is only one crew member at work, who takes an empty train to the coal load out, where he changes to the full train to drive it back to the power plant. While this train is underway, the other one gets loaded.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, the RF4CE (Radio Frequency for Consumer Electronics) Consortium and zigbee {{alliance}} {{agreed to}} deliver jointly {{a standard for}} <b>radio</b> frequency <b>remote</b> <b>controls.</b> Zigbee RF4CE is designed for {{a broad range of}} consumer electronics products, such as TVs and set-top boxes. It promised many advantages over existing <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> solutions, including richer communication and increased reliability, enhanced features and flexibility, interoperability, and no line-of-sight barrier.The zigbee RF4CE specification lifts off some networking weight and does not support all the mesh features, which is traded for smaller memory configurations for lower cost devices, such as <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> of consumer electronics.|$|R

But as science has no limitations, let us make the use of mobile communication not just to have a talk, but to operate remote appliances on walk. In this paper, our proposed idea controls multiple motors using single GSM from anywhere in the world. For this purpose user can use any type of mobile. This way it overcomes the limited range of infrared and <b>radio</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls.</b> Using the convenience of SMS, this project lets you remotely control equipment by sending text messages. Here a hybrid approach is used to monitor and control the motors in the farms. In the wired communication RS 485 mod-bus and in the wireless mode SIM 300 MODEM is used to form hybrid network. RS 485 mod bus is a widely used and accepted communication system in the industrial world as it is reliable and cheaper...|$|R
