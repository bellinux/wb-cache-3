Abstract Managing water resources {{and the need to}} adapt both supply and demand side policies to a changing environment has become a priority in both developed and developing countries. This research demonstrates the application of the geographic information system (GIS) in modelling <b>residential</b> water <b>demand</b> in order to develop a spatial decision support system (SDSS). Household level survey data covering 90 suburbs within the Brisbane City Council (BCC), Queensland, Australia, are used for the analysis. First, <b>residential</b> water <b>demand</b> was estimated and the most significant variables found to predict high water use at the suburban level. These variables included household size, presence of a swimming pool, income and people over 65 years of age. By integrating this model with an SDSS, a spatial decision support system for <b>residential</b> water <b>demand</b> (SDSS-RWD) is developed. By producing maps which clearly display the different factors affecting <b>residential</b> water <b>demand,</b> the benefit of the SDSS-RWD is found in its use as a policy making tool for manipulating and evaluating effective water management strategies. In particular, the flexibility of the SDSS-RWD offers in evaluating changing determinants of <b>residential</b> water <b>demand</b> creates the capacity for local government bodies to analyse a range of alternative policies...|$|R

Two dependent variables were analyzed: total <b>residential</b> water <b>demand</b> (TRWD) and <b>residential</b> water <b>demand</b> per capita (RWD/cap). Within the TRWD model, population served by water services was found to be the only statistically significant variable, with coefficients of determination around 0. 9. It was therefore found, that for forecasting of regional water demands, multiplying a predicted population level with a per capita coefficient might be a sufficient technique at the regional level. Other variables tested included price structure, price of water services, household income and rainfall. With respect to the RWD/cap model, marginal prices were found to be statistically significant within the Prairie region, {{as well as for the}} combination of both regions.
