40|$|Rock {{grouting}} {{is performed}} {{to decrease the}} hydraulic conductivity around underground structures, such as tunnels and caverns. Cement grouts are often used and pumped into joint and fractures of the rock formation. Piston <b>type</b> <b>pumps</b> are mostly used for high pressure rock grouting. A pulsation effect is inevitable when using this <b>type</b> of <b>pump</b> due to {{the movement of the}} piston. The effect of this pulsation on rock grouting is yet to be known but believed to be benefi-cial for the penetration of the grout. Current flow meters used in the field are not accu-rate enough to determine the fluctuation of the flow rate when it is less than 1 l/min. In addition, currently available flow meters measure the average of the flow over a cer-tain period of time, hence the true fluctuation of the flow rate due to the pulsation of the piston remains unknown. In this paper, a new methodology, the so called ‘Ultrasound Velocity Profiling – Pressure Difference’ (UVP+PD) method has been introduced to show the pulsation effect when using a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump.</b> The feasibility of this method was successfully investigated for the direct in-line determination of the rheological properties of micro cement based grouts under field conditions (Rahman & Håkansson, 2011). Subse-quently, it was also found that this method can be very efficient to measure the fluctu-ation of the flow rate for different <b>types</b> of <b>pumps.</b> From a grouting point of view the UVP+PD method can be used to synchronize the pressure and flow of a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump</b> by measuring the pulsation effect. Conse-quently it {{can be used as a}} tool for the efficiency and quality control of different <b>types</b> of <b>pumps.</b> QC 20121221 </p...|$|R

40|$|In the {{previous}} paper, we reported the optimum operation scheduling method which can satisfy the environmental pollution constraint. In a general convenient method, the unit commitment of thermal power stations is {{decided by the}} priority method. But the priority method does not always decide the optimum unit commitment, {{and it may not}} consider the environmental pollution constraint. In this paper, we decide the unit commitment by the effect of stopping a thermal power station. This effect is calculated through considering the system’s cost increase when one thermal power station is stopped. We have considered the recirculating <b>type</b> <b>pumped</b> storage power plants in our serial papers. In this paper, we consider the other energy storage units, for example, the multiple-use <b>type</b> <b>pumped</b> storage units, superconducting coils, or fly-wheels. Our method is applied to a model system, and we report the results as follows. Our method can estimate the optimum operation which satisfies the environmental pollution constraint. The start and stop pattern of thermal power stations changes depending on the constraint of environmental pollution. We also show the influence of the effiｃｉｅｎｃｙ and the ｅnｖｉｒｏnmental pollution constraint on the total system operating cost...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a dynamic model for slipper-pads which allows lift and tilt behaviour to be predicted, including {{the effects of}} possible contact with the swashplate or slipper retaining plate. This model has been incorporated in the Bathfp simulation package and {{used to examine the}} dynamic stability of slipper-pads over the pumping cycle, and to compare the behaviour over a range of pump speeds. The centripetal tilting moments acting on the slipper-pad increase with speed and as a consequence can lead to contact between the slipper and the swashplate at high speed. This is particularly likely to occur as the piston makes the transition between suction and delivery, where the pressure forces acting on the piston-slipper assembly change abruptly. The predicted nature of the swashplate contacts at high speeds correspond closely with witness marks on a dismantled pump. The model presented may also be used for predicting slipper behaviour in other <b>types</b> of <b>pump,</b> for example wobble-plate <b>type</b> <b>pumps,</b> or in piston motor...|$|R
