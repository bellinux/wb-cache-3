40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} the effects of X-linked and autosomal recessive Alport syndrome on retinal basement membranes and how these result in the characteristic perimacular dot-and-fleck retinopathy, lozenge, and macular hole. Methods. The type IV collagen chains present in the normal retina were determined immunohistochemically. Ten patients with Alport syndrome underwent retinal photography and optical coherence tomography to {{determine the}} thickness of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) by segmentation analysis, the layers affected by the retinopathy, and any correlates of the lozenge and macular hole. Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane</b> was examined directly by electron microscopy in a donated Alport eye. Results. The 345 type IV collagen network was present in the normal ILM and in the retinal pigment epithelium basement membrane of Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane.</b> In Alport syndrome, the ILM/nerve fiber layer and Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane</b> were both thinned. The dot-and-fleck retinopathy corresponded to hyperreflectivity of the ILM/nerve fiber layer in the distribution of the nerve fiber layer. The lozenge and macular hole corresponded to temporal macular thinning. The thinning across the whole retina was principally due to thinning of the ILM/nerve fiber layer and inner nuclear layer. Conclusions. The Alport dot-and-fleck retinopathy results primarily from abnormalities in the ILM/nerve fiber layer rather than in Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane.</b> Thinning of the ILM/nerve fiber layer contributes to the retinopathy, lozenge, and macular hole, possibly through interfering with nutrition of the overlying retina or clearance of metabolic by-products...|$|R

One of the two primary focuses of our research is examining how RPE cells respond to luminosity from handheld electronic devices in order to develop a correlation between luminosity and cell health. The data found from this research can help create a standard of production for technology that helps to limit the progression of AMD.

To ensure the effective design and development of membrane chromatography, modelling of this system at transient state or dynamic modelling is of great importance. Until this point dynamic modelling studies have mainly focused on anion exchange and affinity membranes. In this study, dynamic modelling of membrane chromatography was performed using two commercial cation exchange membranes (Natrix C and Sartobind S) for purification of the polyclonal antibody Human IgG. The modelling involved solving three differential equations with eight model parameters and resulted in simulated breakthrough curves for IgG. Three of the model parameters, the overall system volume (Vo), the total porosity of membrane (Ɛ) and the interstitial velocity (U) were determined experimentally using 1 % acetone as tracer under two different buffer conditions at pH 5 (phosphate citrate buffer and acetate buffer). The overall range of the porosity estimates for the two membranes was 0. 77 - 0. 95, which was in agreement with published porosity values. As no research has used tracer to estimate the porosity of cation exchange membranes so far, {{this is one of}} the novel aspects of the study. Further work with an alternative method is required to confirm these porosity estimates. To obtain experimental breakthrough curves, IgG was purified using both Natrix C and Sartobind <b>S</b> <b>membranes</b> under acetate buffer (pH 5) condition.

In vitro evaluation showed 70 nm PLLA ENMs adsorbed high amounts of laminin and supported functional RPE monolayers, exhibiting 3 D polygonal-cobblestone morphology, apical microvilli, basal infoldings, high transepithelial resistance (TER), phagocytic activity and expression of signature RPE markers. 70 nm PLLA ENMs were successfully implanted into the subretinal space of RCS-rdy+p+/LAV rats, also commonly know as rdy rats. At week 4, in the absence of immunosuppressants, implanted PLLA ENMs were surrounded by a significantly low number of activated microglial cells, compared to week 1, indicating no adverse long-term immune response. In conclusion, we successfully designed and tested ENMs emulating the RPE cell supporting layers of the BM, and found 70 nm PLLA ENMs to be best suited as scaffolds for fabricating retinal constructs.

40|$|The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) {{molecule}} of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is {{an integral}} membrane glycoprotein that is oriented with its N-terminus in the cytoplasm and its C-terminus external to the infected cell. Single spanning membrane proteins {{with this type of}} topology (N-terminus in, C-terminus out) have been classified as Type II glycoproteins, in contrast to the more common Type I glycoproteins, which are oriented in the opposite direction. (C-terminus in, N-terminus out). The membrane integration of HN protein was investigated using a wheat germ translation system to synthesize and integrate HN protein into microsomal membranes in vitro. The insertion and translocation of HN protein into microsomal vesicles was found to occur cotranslationally without signal sequence cleavage. The membrane targeting required both signal recognition particle (SRP) and SRP receptor. Membrane binding assays utilizing HN nascent chain/ribosome/SRP complexes demonstrated that the membrane insertion of HN polypeptide required the presence of GTP, in a way similar to that described for secretory, multispanning and Type I proteins. To investigate further the membrane translocation process of HN protein, the amino terminal region of HN was mutated to determine the role of this region in the membrane integration of HN. The cDNA sequence encoding the bulk of the cytoplasmic tail of the HN glycoprotein was deleted. When transcripts produced from the mutated cDNA were translated in wheat germ extract in the presence of membranes, several abnormalities were identified in the interaction of the mutant protein with membranes. Although translocation and glycosylation of the mutant protein was detected, the efficiency of membrane translocation and the stability of the mutant protein 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane</b> interaction were reduced.

Ribosome-bound mutant nascent chains were able to insert into membranes without the addition of GTP or SRP, but this GTP-independent insertion was in reverse. Therefore, the cytoplasmic tail of the HN glycoprotein appears to playa critical role in the maintanence of faithful directionality of the protein 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane</b> insertion...|$|R
40|$|The retinal pigment {{epithelium}} (RPE) is a non-replicating monolayer that {{plays a key role}} nursing the photoreceptors of the neural retina, regulating fluid movement within the subretinal space, maintaining a basal laminar layer of Bruch <b>s</b> <b>membrane,</b> and influencing the choriocapillaris. This project investigates how surgical manipulation of the retinal epithelial layer influences the neural retina, the choroid and the epithelial layer itself. Bleb detachment is a surgical method {{to gain access to the}} subretinal space by separating the neural retina from the RPE, which can be therapeutically useful in procedures such as gene therapy and retinal cell transplantation. This method of separating the RPE from the photoreceptors is not without complications because it can produce a number of abnormalities in the RPE itself as well as in the neural retina and choroid. Jet stream pressure, the standard way to produce a bleb detachment, causes focal damage to the RPE layer and choroid and generalized damage to the apical membranes of the RPE. It also produces folds in the rabbit neural retina, which induce a gradual transformation of the RPE layer. This transformation leads to migration, proliferation and a defect in lysosomal digestion that has been associated with apoptosis. Such changes produced by bleb detachment may explain the gradual loss of RPE allografts or homografts. Photoreceptor transplants survive for a long period of time and can develop outer segments without showing evidence of apoptosis. But such photoreceptor transplants form abnormal rosettes, which may also be due to abnormalities produced in the RPE layer by bleb detachments. These problems associated with the production of bleb detachments should be considered in any attempts to introduce solutions and/or cells into the subretinal space. Attempts to reconstruct or repair the RPE layer by transplantation can involve the removal of RPE cells from Bruch <b>s</b> <b>membrane</b> before replacing them with transplanted cells; it can also involve biopsy of RPE cells for culture or transplantation to another site. The removal of RPE cells from Bruch <b>s</b> <b>membrane</b> causes significant changes in the choroid. Removal of large areas of RPE leads to inflammation and fibrosis in the choroid that compresses the large choroidal vessels leading to reduction of blood flow in the terminal choriocapillary beds. The absence of an RPE layer without its replacement may also cause atrophy of the choriocapillaris by the loss of a hypothetical trophic factor. Even slight pressure on the RPE layer without any removal of cells leads to rapid but reversible reduction in flow of large choroidal vessels, which appears to be due to vasospastic constriction and/or thrombosis. Because the recovery from such changes can take hours or days, this abnormality could lead to degeneration of the neural retina and may be related to other choroidal abnormalities. Removal of local segments of the neural retina causes profound changes in the adjacent RPE layer, which are even more pronounced than what is observed in bleb detachments or what has been described after prolonged retinal detachments. It reveals that the neural retina must inhibit the transformation of the RPE layer by releasing a factor that suppresses this response. The results are important for understanding how to enter and manipulate the structures bordering the subretinal space, the photoreceptors, the retinal epithelium and the choroid. It offers insights into how the methodology for surgical repair of these structures such as gene therapy and/or transplantation can be made more effective...|$|R

The histological appearance of the choroid and retina of P. scapulatus confirmed a vascular core to the papillae with a thin, but definite Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane.</b> Megachiroptera have a unique vascular system to supply nutrition to the retina consisting of capillary loops within a dense, uniform mosaic of choroidal projections or papillae, which permit the diffusion of metabolites to the retina and a heretofore undescribed vascular tuft emanating from the optic disc. We suggest that this vascular system provides nutrition by diffusion to a thick avascular retina, without any shadowing by vessels, and allows for nocturnal visual acuity and light-gathering capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Membranes of six spiroplasma strains {{belonging}} to different Spiroplasma species and subgroups were isolated {{by a combination}} of osmotic lysis and sonication in the presence of EDTA to block endogenous phospholipase activity. Analysis of membrane lipids showed that in addition to free and esterified cholesterol the spiroplasmas incorporated exogenous phospholipids from the growth medium. Sphingomyelin was preferentially incorporated from phosphatidylcholine-sphingomyelin vesicles or from the serum used to supplement the growth medium. Palmitate was incorporated better than oleate into membrane lipids synthesized by the organisms during growth. The major phospholipid synthesized by the spiroplasmas was phosphatidylglycerol. The positional distribution of the fatty acids in phosphatidylglycerol of Spiroplasma floricola resembled that found in Mycoplasma species, in which the saturated fatty acids prefer position 2 in the glycerol backbone and not position 1 as found in Acholeplasma species and elsewhere in nature. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis of spin-labeled fatty acids incorporated into <b>S.</b> floricola <b>membranes</b> exhibited homogeneous single-component spectra without immobilized regions. The <b>S.</b> floricola <b>membranes</b> were more rigid than those of Acholeplasma laidlawii and less rigid than those of Mycoplasma gallisepticum...|$|R
40|$|Affinity columns {{suitable}} for HPLC were prepared by immobilization of various ligands of protein A, human IgG, human IgM and pectinase on GMA modified cellulose membrane. The adsorption capacity, affinity efficiency and activity recovery of various IgGs on these affinity columns were measured. It was {{observed that the}} length of the coupling arm plays a very important role in affinity efficiency, and the effect of eluent flow-rate on adsorption capacity was very small. The protein A column was exploited for the process monitoring of dog IgG in clinical experiments on immuno-adsorption therapy. A pectinase column was used for the determination of polygalacturonase inhibiting proteins first purified on a hydroxyapatite column. It took only about 2. 5 min for analysis at a flow-rate of 1. 0 mL min(- 1). The high speed analysis of biopolymers could be performed at a flow rate of 6. 0 mL min(- 1) within 15 <b>s.</b> <b>Membrane</b> affinity chromatography gives good reproducibility, high efficiency, low column-pressure and is rapid. It can also be used for micro-scale purification of biopolymers...|$|R
40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) is a devastating ocular disease affecting {{one third of}} the elderly population in the western world. Some cases of AMD develop neovascular membranes, which are characterized by the pathologic growth of new blood vessels into the retina. This pathology may be initiated by proteins capable of activating endothelial cells to become angiogenic or inflammatory, later causing them to grow abnormally. This investigation aimed to determine the causes of pathologic blood vessel growth in AMD. Human eyes with AMD have been shown by us and others to have abnormal activities of angiogenin, complement component C 5 anaphylatoxin (C 5 a), and/or elastin fragments. We therefore employed methods including PCR, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, morphometrics, tissue culture, ultrastructural observations, and functional assays to determine the effects angiogenin, C 5 a, and elastin fragments on the angiogenic and inflammatory changes of choroidal endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. It was shown that choroidal endothelial cells express the surface receptor for C 5 a. Also, these cells increase their expression of ICAM- 1, a surface protein that mediates leukocyte trafficking, in response to elevated levels of C 5 a in organ culture. This indicates that increased levels of C 5 a associated with AMD increase the inflammatory behavior of choroidal endothelial cells. It was demonstrated that choroidal endothelial cells are able to internalize angiogenin, a potent inducer of angiogenesis. Although cells from the choroid did not increase their angiogenic responses to this protein, their ability to internalize it indicates that they may respond to it by a different mechanism. Elevated levels of elastin fragments, however, did increase the migratory response of choroidal endothelial cells in culture, which is a key event in angiogenesis. Elevated levels of elastin fragents also increased the amount of collagen IV deposition within Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane</b> in a mouse model. This is relevant to AMD pathology as deposits within Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane</b> are common manifestations associated with AMD. This body of work has provided new insights into the roles of angiogenin, C 5 a, and elastin fragments in activating choroidal endothelial cells to becoming inflammatory or angiogenic. These endothelial cell behaviors are common characteristics found in neovascular AMD. These new findings will help aid in the further understanding of the pathobiology of this disease in hopes to provide improved treatments in the future...|$|R
40|$|Glaucoma is {{the second}} leading cause of {{blindness}} worldwide. The clinical standard for monitoring the functional deficits in the retina that are caused by glaucoma is the visual field test. In addition to monitoring the functional loss, evaluating the disease-related structural changes in the human retina also helps with diagnosis and management of this progressive disease. The characteristic changes of retinal structures such as the optic nerve head (ONH) are monitored utilizing imaging modalities such as color (stereo) fundus photography and, more recently, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). With the inherent subjectivity and time required for manually segmenting retinal structures, {{there has been a}} great interest in automated approaches. Since both fundus and SD-OCT images are often acquired for the assessment of glaucoma, the automated segmentation approaches can benefit from combining the multimodal complementary information from both sources. The goal of the current work is to automatically segment the retinal structures and extract the proper parameters of the optic nerve head related to the diagnosis and management of glaucoma. The structural parameters include the cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) which is a 2 D parameter and is obtainable from both fundus and SD-OCT modalities. Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane</b> opening-minimum rim width (BMO-MRW) is a recent 3 D structural parameter that is obtainable from the SD-OCT modality only. We propose to use the complementary information from both fundus and SD-OCT modalities in order to enhance the segmentation of structures of interest. In order to enable combining information from different modalities, a feature-based registration method is proposed for aligning the fundus and OCT images. In addition, our goal is to incorporate the machine-learning techniques into the graph-theoretic approach that is used for segmenting the structures of interest. Thus, the major contributions of this work include: 1) use of complementary information from SD-OCT and fundus images for segmenting the optic disc and cup boundaries in both modalities, 2) identifying the extent that accounting for the presence of externally oblique border tissue and retinal vessels in rim-width-based parameters affects structure-structure correlations, 3) designing a feature-based registration approach for registering multimodal images of the retina, and 4) developing a multimodal graph-based approach to segment the optic nerve head (ONH) structures such as Internal Limiting Membrane (ILM) surface and Bruch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>membrane</b> surface 2 ̆ 7 s opening...|$|R

40|$|The folding and {{oligomerization}} of coronavirus {{spike protein}} were explored using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Chemical cross-linking and sedimentation experiments showed that the spike of transmissible gastroenteritis virus is a homotrimer of the <b>S</b> <b>membrane</b> glycoprotein. The spike protein was synthesized as a 175, 000 -apparent-molecular-weight (175 K) monomer subunit that is sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. Assembly of monomers into a trimeric structure was found to occur on a partially trimmed polypeptide {{and to be a}} rate-limiting step, since large amounts of monomers failed to trimerize 1 h after completion of synthesis. Terminal glycosylation of newly assembled trimers, resulting in the biosynthesis of three 220 K oligomers, occurred with a half time of approximately 20 min. Monomeric (230 K to 240 K) processed forms were also observed in cells and in virions. The 175 K monomeric form expressed four major antigenic sites previously localized within the amino-terminal half of the S polypeptide chain; however, two classes of trimer-restricted epitopes (borne by three 220 K and/or three 175 K oligomers) were identified. The S glycoprotein of coronavirus might be a valuable model system for discovering new aspects of the maturation of membrane glycoproteins...|$|R
40|$|Developmentally {{regulated}} mechanisms involving alternative RNA splicing and/or polyadenylation, {{as well as}} transcription termination, are {{implicated in}} controlling the levels of secreted mu (mu <b>s),</b> <b>membrane</b> mu (mu m) and delta immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain mRNAs during B cell differentiation (mu gene encodes the mu heavy chain). Using expression vectors constructed with genomic DNA segments composed of the mu m polyadenylation signal region, we analyzed poly(A) site utilization and termination of transcription in stably transfected myeloma cells and in murine fibroblast L cells. We found that the gene segment containing the mu m poly(A) signals, along with 536 bp of downstream flanking sequence, acted as a transcription terminator in both myeloma cells and L cell fibroblasts. Neither a 141 -bp DNA fragment (which directed efficient polyadenylation at the mu m site), nor the 536 -bp flanking nucleotide sequence alone, were sufficient to obtain a similar regulation. This shows that the mu m poly(A) region plays {{a central role in}} controlling developmentally regulated transcription termination by blocking downstream delta gene expression. Because this gene segment exhibited the same RNA processing and termination activities in fibroblasts, it appears that these processes are not tissue-specific...|$|R
