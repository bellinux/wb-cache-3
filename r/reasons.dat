40|$|Scattered {{remarks on}} {{different}} types of <b>reason</b> {{can be found in}} Emil Cioran’s books. In the here presented essay it was shown that all the distinguished varieties of <b>reason</b> are connected to each other and it is possible to talk about emerging of another type from the previous one. These types are: naïve <b>reason,</b> rationalistic <b>reason,</b> negating <b>reason,</b> doubtful <b>reason</b> and expanded <b>reason.</b> Naïve <b>reason</b> is the one that serves life without self-consciousness. Rationalistic <b>reason</b> makes decrees on reality. In his critical remarks Cioran describes rationalistic <b>reason</b> as being dangerous. Two other types of <b>reason</b> are the negating and the doubtful one. Cioran proves that affirmation leads human beings to giving up themselves and that liberation always comes through constant fight for negation. Negating <b>reason</b> is always turned towards something external to itself. Doubtful <b>reason</b> goes much further by actually turning against itself, it is in constant struggle against itself. Cioran describes this process as separating the <b>reason</b> and standing face to face with yourself. Therefore he is aware that only the <b>reason</b> itself can become a judge of <b>reason.</b> The fifth type of <b>reason</b> which can be distinguished in Cioran’s philosophy might be called the extended <b>reason</b> as it is a demand for unfolding the <b>reason.</b> When one realizes that there is nothing permanent in the world and cognition can’t bring any permanent results either, the <b>reason</b> according to Cioran might become active again by turning back towards reality – however without any further dogma of objective truth – and by using “flowing” ideas it can unite with reality...|$|R

40|$|In ""Critical Elucidation of the Analytic of Pure Practical Reason"" Kant {{tries to}} clarify some points of his Moral Theory, which he {{discussed}} in the ""Analytic of Pure Practical Reason"". Kant's Phylosophy depends on the pure <b>reason.</b> But <b>reason</b> is distinguished into theoretical <b>reason</b> and practical <b>reason.</b> Theoretical <b>reason</b> endeavours to grasp the ohjects; and objects are given to senses. We accept objects through senses and then grasp them and make concepts. But practical <b>reason</b> has moral principles a priori and makes them realized in the world. So theoretical <b>reason</b> starts from sensation and progresses to concepts, but practical <b>reason</b> has the fundamental principle of morals and progresses to sensation (feeling). Accordingly theoretical <b>reason</b> and practical <b>reason</b> advance in opposite direction. But they are {{two sides of the}} same pure <b>reason.</b> So they must have the same construction. In the first Critique Kant starts from the theory of sensation. But there he enquires the conditions a priori of sensation, which don't depend on sensation but give foundation to it. And they belong to the pure <b>reason.</b> So in the philosophy of Kant the central point is pure <b>reason,</b> and this pure <b>reason</b> devides itself to two spheres of <b>reason.</b> And we must recognize the unity of <b>reason</b> behind two functions of <b>reason.</b> The next point is the distinction of the doctrine of happiness and the doctrine of morals. The former is based upon empirical principles. Following this doctrine, the observation of moral principles is for happiness. And the conditions of happiness must be known empirically. But moal theory must be based upon principles a priori of pure <b>reason.</b> Thus we must refuse the doctrine of happiness. But Kant does not negate the meaning of happiness for the human being. It is quite normal to desire happiness. But when there is moral conflict, we must prioritize moral principle. The principles of morals are the foundation of human life itself. ...|$|R
