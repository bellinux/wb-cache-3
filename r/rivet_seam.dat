5000|$|Lancashire boilers often show {{corrugated}} flues, which absorb {{thermal expansion}} without straining the <b>riveted</b> <b>seams.</b> Another development was the [...] "kidney flue" [...] or Galloway boiler, {{where the two}} furnaces join together into a single flue, kidney-shaped in cross-section. This widened and flat-topped flue was stayed {{by the use of}} Galloway tubes.|$|R
5000|$|At 12:45 a.m. on {{the morning}} of Sunday, August 17, 1975, the tanker M/T Afran Neptune, tied up at a Gulf Refinery dock, began pumping reconstituted Venezuelan crude oil (with an {{additional}} 5 percent naphtha) into Gulf Refinery Tank No. 231. Tank No. 231, built in 1929, of <b>riveted</b> <b>seam</b> construction, had a capacity of [...] and had recently been renovated with an internal floating roof. Within the refinery, the tank was located at Avenue “Y” and 4th Street.|$|R
5000|$|Wiltsie {{conducted}} an ASW training operation early in January 1970 {{and returned to}} San Diego on the 8th. Between that day and 15 April, Wiltsie remained in port. During this time, she suffered hull damage while moored alongside John W. Thomason. [...] "Exceptionally high winds" [...] buffeted the ships together when a mooring camel between the two ships overturned, opening <b>riveted</b> <b>seams</b> in Wiltsies hull. On 13 March 1970, Wiltsie was drydocked at the San Diego Marine and Shipbuilding Co. and was under repairs there until 7 April.|$|R
50|$|Historically, boilers were {{a source}} of many serious {{injuries}} and property destruction due to poorly understood engineering principles. Thin and brittle metal shells can rupture, while poorly welded or <b>riveted</b> <b>seams</b> could open up, leading to a violent eruption of the pressurized steam. When water is converted to steam it expands to over 1,000 times its original volume and travels down steam pipes at over 100 kilometres per hour. Because of this, steam {{is a great way}} of moving energy and heat around a site from a central boiler house to where it is needed, but without the right boiler feed water treatment, a steam-raising plant will suffer from scale formation and corrosion. At best, this increases energy costs and can lead to poor quality steam, reduced efficiency, shorter plant life and unreliable operation. At worst, it can lead to catastrophic failure and loss of life. Collapsed or dislodged boiler tubes can also spray scalding-hot steam and smoke out of the air intake and firing chute, injuring the firemen who load the coal into the fire chamber. Extremely large boilers providing hundreds of horsepower to operate factories can potentially demolish entire buildings.|$|R
5000|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint the Saxonia {{reflected in the}} main its English counterparts. Only a few details exist about {{the design of the}} boiler. The boiler barrel had <b>rivetted</b> longitudinal <b>seams,</b> the vertical boiler had a curved, cylindrical top. A flat plate on top of the vertical boiler provided a platform for the steam whistle and spring balance safety valve. On top of the front section of the boiler barrel was the tall, narrow steam dome. The grate was designed to be moveable.|$|R
50|$|The {{boiler barrel}} was {{built up in}} three rings, {{arranged}} telescopically, with the smallest diameter at the firebox end. The rings were lap-jointed and double <b>riveted</b> on longitudinal <b>seams.</b> These boilers had a long life and required little expense in repairs. Five cross-stays were fitted in the steam space above the firebox. The safety valves were arranged above the firebox inside the cab, while a steam escape pipe was fitted above the valves and passed through the roof.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{completion}} {{of their work}} there, the two ships returned to Cape Hallett, where Arneb moored to the ice while Northwind proceeded into Moubray Bay to clear an unloading site. On {{the last day of}} 1956, the ice pack into which Arneb was nosed began to move and soon surrounded the ship with solid ice pressing against her hull. The framing {{on both sides of the}} ship began to buckle, <b>rivets</b> popped, <b>seams</b> split, and beams ripped. Frigid water and ice began flooding into several cargo holds at a combined rate of 1200 gallons per minute. Damage control parties worked doggedly to contain the inrush of water, but the men were only able to stay in the water for a few minutes at a time. Nevertheless, by using mattresses, steel plates, and shoring timbers, they managed to reduce the flow of water until the pumps could lower the water level.|$|R
5000|$|No further mishaps {{occurred}} until 30 January when Arneb, the icebreaker , {{and cargo}} ship [...] attempted {{to push through}} the icepack off Knox Coast. A large chunk of ice broke off and brushed Arneb's port side, ripping a gash 12 feet long and one-half inch wide and once again flooding the holds as well as buckling plates, popping <b>rivets,</b> and opening <b>seams.</b> The experienced damage control parties used the same techniques to patch the new wounds in her hull. The ships then got underway again, with Glacier towing Arneb. Early the next morning, they arrived at Knox Coast and once again, the damage was repaired.|$|R
50|$|By late February Erie {{was still}} in dry dock but after having {{had a number of}} <b>rivets</b> {{replaced}} and <b>seams</b> recaulked, her hull was repainted and she was ready to head out to sea on 1 March to dock at Tompkinsville, NY. On 2 March, she got underway for a brief voyage to the Naval Operating Base at Norfolk, VA, returning to New York on 5 March. It was then that her commander learned that Erie would be assigned duties at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in May. She would be the lead vessel for the Coastal Cruising Detachment taking members of the Academy's Second, Junior, Class on cruises to North Atlantic ports throughout the summer.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the methodology for determining <b>seam</b> <b>rivet</b> fragments most exposed to fatigue {{damage caused by}} buckling cover sheet occurring in the semi-monocoque structures. The present study is focused on determining {{the impact of the}} tension field, {{which is one of the}} cases of buckling, the state of the burden and strain of riveted joints occurring in shell structures. The conditions in which tension field arise for example two-flange girder were also examined. Analysis was also performed to explore micro-slides between the rivet and the hole in the conditions of normal and torsional loads of combined sheets. The presented method allows both the determination of dangerous places, susceptible to the tension field for the whole structure, as well as a detailed analysis of selected parts of the structure- which can be useful, especially in the design of structures on the basis of supervising durability...|$|R
500|$|Dürer's woodcut is not {{an entirely}} {{accurate}} representation of a rhinoceros. He depicts an animal with hard plates that cover its body like sheets of armour, with a gorget at the throat, a solid-looking breastplate, and <b>rivets</b> along the <b>seams.</b> He places a small twisted horn on its back, and gives it scaly legs and saw-like rear quarters. None of these features are present in a real rhinoceros, although the Indian rhinoceros does have deep folds in its skin that can look like armor from a distance. Despite its anatomical inaccuracies, Dürer's woodcut became very popular in Europe and was copied {{many times in the}} following three centuries. It was regarded by Westerners as a true representation of a rhinoceros into the late 18th century. Eventually, it was supplanted by more realistic drawings and paintings, particularly those of Clara the rhinoceros, who toured Europe in the 1740s and 1750s. It has been said of Dürer's woodcut: [...] "probably no animal picture has exerted such a profound influence on the arts".|$|R

It is possible that a suit of armour was forged for the rhinoceros's fight against the elephant in Portugal, and that these features depicted by Dürer are parts of the armour. Alternatively, Dürer's [...] "armour" [...] may represent the heavy folds of thick skin of an Indian rhinoceros, or, as with the other inaccuracies, may simply be misunderstandings or creative additions by Dürer. Dürer also draws a scaly texture over {{the body of the}} animal, including the [...] "armour". This may be Dürer's attempt to reflect the rough and almost hairless hide of the Indian rhinoceros, which has wart-like bumps covering its upper legs and shoulders. On the other hand, his depiction of the texture may represent dermatitis induced by the rhinoceros' close confinement during the four-month journey by ship from India to Portugal.|$|R
