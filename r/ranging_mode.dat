It combines the attributes of a pointable laser ranging system making observations to cube corner retroreflectors placed on the ground with those of a nadir looking laser altimeter making height observations to ground, ice sheet, and oceanic surfaces. In the <b>ranging</b> <b>mode,</b> centimeter-level precise baseline and station coordinate determinations will be made on grids consisting of 100 to 200 targets separated by distances from a few tens of kilometers to about 1000 km. These measurements will be used for studies of seismic zone crustal deformations and tectonic plate motions. Ranging measurements will also be made to a coarser, but globally distributed array of retroreflectors for both precise geodetic and orbit determination applications. In the altimetric mode, relative height determinations will be obtained with approximately decimeter vertical precision and 70 to 100 meter horizontal resolution. The height data will be used to study surface topography and roughness, ice sheet and lava flow thickness, and ocean dynamics. Waveform digitization will provide a measure of the vertical extent of topography within each footprint. The planned Earth Observing System is an attractive candidate platform for GLARS since the GLAR data can be used both for direct analyses and for highly precise orbit determination needed in the reduction of data from other sensors on the multi-instrument platform.

GNSS (primarily GPS and GLONASS) has become the primary PNT source for maritime operations. The GNSS position is used both for vessel navigation and as the position source for AIS. Unfortunately, GNSS is vulnerable to jamming and interference – not intentional and unintentional. This can lead to the loss of positioning information or even worse, to incorrect positioning information. The user requirement is for dependable PNT information at all times, even under GNSS jamming conditions. One potential source of resilient PNT services is <b>Ranging</b> <b>Mode</b> (R-Mode) using signals independent of GNSS. The German Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration has contracted for a feasibility study of R-mode using MF-DGNSS and VHF AIS signals as well as those signals in combination and in combination with eLoran. The first part of the study focused on the feasibility of using MF-DGNSS signals for ranging and timing. It examined the state of the art, identified potential solution methods, and, after examining Pros and Cons of the various options, selected a few options for further study.

40|$|Ultrasonic or sonar sensors {{are widely}} used for range finding for indoor and outdoor {{applications}} in robotics. However, for outdoors applications, they pose different environmental challenges. Ultrasonic sensor can be used both in air and underwater. It emits acoustic pulses in a cone shaped form in its surroundings and waits for the echoes from the objects nearby that lie within its working range. Ultrasonic sensors have convincing advantages over other sensors. However, sonar sensors have different practical limitations as well which need to be carefully dealt with while working with these sensors. Ultrasonic sensors have several applications in electronics and robotics including obstacle detection and avoidance, mapping and navigation, object recognition and identification. Ultrasonic sensors {{are widely used}} in automatic car parking systems in modern vehicles, where two to four sensors are mounted in rear bumper for detecting obstacles up to 2. 5 meter and assisting the driver about the parallel parking. The thesis is mainly divided into two parts. In the first part, background studies and literature review is presented which describes sonar sensing principle, applications, advantages, limitations and outdoor sensing challenges. In the second part, a sonar system for obstacle detection for a mobile machine is implemented and its tests and results are discussed. The study indicates the testing of ultrasonic sensors for obstacles detection for an autonomous mobile vehicle outdoor. The sensors were tested both on static frame and on real machine detecting different obstacles from 60 cm up to five meters. The results are better when the object is in front or moving along the axis of the sensor. The sensors are connected in series and are in <b>ranging</b> <b>mode</b> all the time. The experimental {{results show that the}} environmental factors like, air turbulence and temperature change affect the speed of sound in air and measuring range. The ranging value is better indoors than the outdoors for same obstacles. However, the results are better on less windy day and also when the surface is strong reflector. It is noted that the results get improved when a cone made of paper or plastic is wrapped around the transducer.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), especially the U. S. Global Positioning System (GPS), have become the primary PNT sources for maritime operations. The GNSS position is used both for vessel navigation and as the position and timing source for other systems such as Automatic Identification System (AIS). Unfortunately, GNSS is vulnerable to jamming and interference, intentional or not, which can lead to the loss of positioning information or, even worse, to incorrect positioning information. The user requirement is for dependable PNT information at all times. One potential source of resilient PNT services is <b>Ranging</b> <b>Mode</b> (R-Mode), an alternative PNT concept related to Signals of OPportunity (SoOP) PNT, which uses signals independent of GNSS. In 2013 the German Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration contracted for a feasibility study of R-Mode using medium frequency (MF) Differential GNSS (DGNSS) and very high frequency (VHF) AIS signals as well as those signals in combination and in combination with eLoran. At ION GNSS+ 2014 some of the authors presented the results from that feasibility study and showed the projected performance using the signals individually and in combination. In most of the shipping lanes on the North Sea it appeared that 10 m or better performance could be achieved. Following up on that work, prototypes of a transmitter and receiver for MF-DGNSS R-Mode have been developed. The transmitter was installed in IJmuiden (Netherlands) and the receiver deployed along the Dutch coast to the south of the transmitter for initial on-air testing of the R-Mode concept; both were synchronized to UTC via GPS. While positioning is not possible with only one R-Mode transmitter, the combination of a synchronized transmitter and receiver pair allows for useful testing of the R-Mode concept. Specifically, the receiver could estimate a true range (rather than a pseudorange); hence, the stability of the range with environmental variations (e. g. weather, day/night skywave effects, etc.) can be studied. To further study skywave effects, the R-Mode modulator was relocated to a more powerful transmitter at Heligoland (Germany) and the receiver moved to a location near the Kiel Canal (Germany). A second receiver was installed at a similar distance from the transmitter to enable simultaneous comparison of two different propagation paths. Later a third receiver was added in order to provide three paths of different lengths. The original R-Mode feasibility study also examined the number of stations that {{it would be possible to}} receive in the North Sea area to ensure there were sufficient stations for positioning. However, it did not look at the converse question; how would a large number of R-Mode signals impact legacy users. As part of the prototype development, very limited experiments were performed to assess the impact of the new signals on legacy DGNSS receivers. Specifically, during the on-air testing mentioned above, a commercial DGNSS receiver was able to accurately demodulate and decode the on-air transmissions from the single prototype R-Mode transmitter; the impact of multiple signals was not examined. A new study, funded by the General Lighthouse Authorities of the UK and Ireland, has just been initiated to analyze how legacy equipment would respond to multiple R-Mode signals at different frequencies, both in-band and out-of-band. This paper presents details of the prototype transmitter and receiver and includes statistical analyses of the range estimates recorded to date and the impact of skywave interference at night using data from the German test sites. Additionally, this paper includes preliminary results of the R-Mode signal interference study...|$|E
