Simulated engine exposures in a jet fuel burner rig with cyclic air cooling were studied. The effects of surface machining before coating and <b>re-machining</b> and re-coating after exposures were examined.

40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{aluminide}} coating, Codep B- 1, and of section thickness were investigated on two cast nickel base superalloys, Rene 80 and Rene 120. Cast section thicknesses ranged from 0. 038 cm to 0. 15 cm. Simulated engine exposures for 1000 hours at 899 C or 982 C in a jet fuel burner rig with cyclic air cooling were studied, as were the effects of surface machining before coating and <b>re-machining</b> and re-coating after exposures. The properties evaluated included tensile at room temperature., 871 C and 982 C, stress rupture at 760 C, 871 C, 982 C and 1093 C, high cycle mechanical fatigue at room temperature., and thermal fatigue with a 1093 C peak temperature. Thin sections had tensile strengths similar to standard size bars up to 871 C and lower strengths at 982 C and above, with equivalent elongation, and stress rupture life was lower for thin sections at all test conditions. The aluminide coating lowered tensile and rupture strengths up to 871 C, with greater effects on thinner specimens. Elevated temperature exposure lowered tensile and rupture strengths of thinner specimens at the lower test temperatures. Surface machining {{had little effect on}} properties, but <b>re-machining</b> after exposure reduced thickness and increased metallurgical changes enough to lower properties at most test conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of the Linac 4 Drift Tube Linac (DTL) required the welding assembly of 10 ⁸ drift tubes (DT) {{which has been}} undertaken at the CERN workshop. The design of the DTL is particular {{in that it was}} purposely simplified to avoid any position adjustment mechanism for drift tubes in the tank. In consequence, drift tubes have been designed with tight tolerances and parts have been assembled with an optimised welding procedure. Two <b>re-machining</b> stages have been introduced in order to compensate for welding distortions.

40|$|Ultrasonic molding {{is a new}} {{technology}} used to process polymeric micro-molded parts. An ultrasonic horn, or sonotrode, transmits ultrasonic energy which melts the material and pushes it into a mold cavity to configure a shape. Sonotrode design - and any transformations to the dimensions or shape caused by tool wear - strongly affects efficient operation. The sonotrode may go beyond the generator operating frequency range, thus affecting process performance. This paper assesses two issues involving a stepped sonotrode employed in ultrasonic molding: (i) a design procedure that can predict the sonotode's behavior during the molding process and (ii) a method for creating a sonotrode operating frequencies map which will facilitate the design of new sonotrodes {{and be able to}} determine the extent to which they can be <b>re-machined</b> after a certain period of wear. Numerical simulations carried out by finite element methods were compared to experimental measurements performed to capture the sonotrode frequency vibrational modes. A frequency map provides the dimensional range within which the sonotrode can be <b>re-machined</b> in order to eliminate tool wear and allow the sonotrode to work properly again, thus extending the lifecycle of the toolThis project was carried out with the helpof a DPI 2013 - 45201 -P reference grant awarded by the Spanish Gov-ernmen...|$|R

As a framework of accuracy assured machining, a closed loop machining operation is proposed based on four fundamental functions. They are physics conscious operation planning, intelligent monitoring, on-machine shape measurement and error source estimation and determination of <b>re-machining</b> strategy. Last three functions are essential in accuracy assured machining. As a preliminary development of the accuracy assured machining, a method to achieve a rapid and accurate on-machine shape measurement is also explained. 特集 : The Papers Presented at the Symposium on Mechanical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Robotics 2015 (MIER 2015) held at Muroran, Hokkaido, Japan on 29 - 30 May 201...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} HSC milling of complex {{geometry}} {{is carried out}} in several stages that include the rest machining, which is typical for manufacturing of parts with complex geometry. Since the rest machining is a more extensive stage than previously imagined, selection of favorable milling strategy in the rest machining stage requires a closer view. This paper presents {{the solution to the}} generation of milling strategies for rest machining by using commercial CAM systems, which offer a broad possibility for the organization of time-optimal machining sequence to assure the demanded surface quality. By application of these strategies, the standard tool paths are generated based on geometric computations only, not considering allowance dividing between the ball end milling tools, which are necessary for <b>re-machining</b> the residual materials areas at the workpiece with many cavities. In this work used algorithm makes it possible to select the optimal tool combination for rest machining with respect to surface quality...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} aimed at {{uncovering}} {{the new economic}} logic of social networks, I concentrate on a substantial <b>re-machining</b> of Bataille’s notion of a sovereign ‘accursed share’ of general economy to add a theoretical dimension that I propose to term ‘ecanomie’ which suspends, I will argue, the traditional moral-numerical restrictions of a hitherto dominant ‘economic housing’. The lodging here of this portmanteau is coined to uneasily combine the previously separate concepts of ‘economy’ and ‘anomie’ into something that suspends the classical modeling of each. AswellasconvertingthesediscursivepositionsofBataille’stothebenefitofoutlining this recent historical turn I will also be utilising Heidegger’s regional take on signification [Bedeutung] to uncover the ‘concrete re-arrangements’ or re- configurations of embodied worldview that such ecanomic acts formally indicate or entail. Signification, it is argued, is not an abstract upper ‘layer’ or a mere outer ‘ontic shell’ of representation, but a corporeal networked substance that works-over all individual comportments. I will finally explore this substantively through the optic of Derrida’s deployment of biopolitical ‘autoimmunity’, here in the concrete re- signification of ‘the suicidal’ within social networking ecanomic technologies of the self...|$|E

40|$|Capacitive stress {{transducers}} {{are used}} to measure mechanical stresses in the windings of superconducting dipole magnets. These transducers consist of a bonded laminate composed of alternating foils of stainless steel and a high-strength polymer known as polyimide. The thin, flat design of the transducers is ideal for measuring the integrated Lorentz stresses within the windings when current is flowing in the coil to generate a magnetic field. The process of fabricating and calibrating these custom gauges {{has proven to be}} a non-trivial problem. Previously, many variables have been left unchecked during the fabrication and calibration phases thus leading to non-repeatable transducers. My goal is to improve upon current methods of transducer fabrication to yield more consistent responses and robust packages. To accomplish this, new techniques and fixtures have been developed to control factors, such as layer alignment, thickness variability and calibration consistency. New fixtures that have been developed are a polyimide cutting fixture, a new transducer alignment and epoxy curing fixture, a torque fixture, and a <b>re-machined</b> testing fixture. These new fixtures, coupled with new techniques, will increase the repeatability and reliability of the transducers. Incorporating these fixtures has lead to a 75 % decrease in thickness variations across the length of the transducers, 62 % reduction in total epoxy thickness and a 70 % decrease in number of pressure cycles required for calibration curve convergence. While these improvements produce impressive results, additional transducers are being constructed and calibrated to verify these findings. The improved fabrication and calibration methods and fixtures, results and conclusions will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} methodology for enhancing {{the performance of}} a precision computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tool. The ability to precisely maintain the desired relative position between the cutting tool and the workpiece along the cutting trajectory has a major impact on the dimensional accuracy of the finished part. It is important to ensure that the workpiece geometry satisfies tolerances before removing it from the machine tool. Traditional manufacturing procedures do not catch bad parts until the post-process inspection stage, when the part has already been removed from the setup. Subsequent attempts at <b>re-machining</b> require that the workpiece be re-fixtured back on the machine which often introduces more error into the process. The objective of this research is to develop a methodology that integrates pre-process calibration and process-intermittent gaging to enhance the ability of a two-axis vertical turning center to cut a circular arc. The developed methodology is straightforward and integrates the usage of commercially available instrumentation such as the ball bar and on-machine probe for error identification, prediction, and compensation.

40|$|What do you {{get when}} you take one professor, two instructors, four mentors, {{seventeen}} mechanical engineers and $ 6, 500 ? One coffee table! Well, at least in our case. During the fall of 2008, our team of senior mechanical engineers enrolled in MIT's capstone design course, 2. 009 The Product Engineering Process, designed and prototyped a high-end, spiral-folding coffee table named Elika, a product borne out of months of idea generation, brainstorming, market research, machining, testing, troubleshooting, and <b>re-machining.</b> Perhaps our judgment was muddled by the high we got after the final presentation, or maybe we finally realized that we were in fact workaholics, but a group of us decided we couldn't stop working on the table and needed to start a company to bring it to market. This is the story of how we went from a bunch of students trying to fulfill a graduation requirement, to a team of founders of a design company. Along the way, we've learned about patents, business, and manufacturing options; we've explored engineering, industrial, and graphic design; we've anticipated our market niche and how to capture it. But through it all, and despite the set-backs, low points, and YouTube-ing, we've had a blast diving into the unknown to chase after an idea we developed together.

40|$|The mold {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of the continuous casting machine since the mold controls the shape and initial solidification of the steel product, where quality is either created or lost. During casting, the mold is submitted to heat flux from liquid steel on one side whereas the other side is water cooled, leading to the generation of large temperature gradients. It is also submitted to other stresses such as ferrostatic pressure and clamping forces. Casting can last several dozens of hours whereas the cooling step of the mold, when liquid steel is not poured anymore into the mold, can last only a few minutes. Maintaining a reliable, crack-free mold within close dimensional tolerances is crucial to safety and productivity. In order to withdraw the right amount of heat and to prevent mold distortion, mold is generally made of copper alloys that have the thermal and mechanical properties required for this function. The two copper alloys most widely used for casting mold are Cu-Ag and Cu-Cr-Zr. They present a wide range of thermal and mechanical properties due to the different treatments to which they can be submitted. The present master thesis aims to study the influence of thermomechanical properties of copper alloys on continuous casting mold behavior during casting and cooling, and more precisely on mold for continuous casting of steel slabs using realistic finite element models of heat transfer and stress. After realizing a literature review of the most widely used copper alloys, three finite elements models were developed in order to study the influence of three copper alloy grades on mold thermomechanical behavior. The three finite elements models were a 2 D simplistic transverse section of the mold model, a 2 D transverse section of the mold model that includes bolts and the backup plate and a 3 D quarter mold model. Simulations of casting and cooling step were performed with ABAQUS 6. 10 ® for the two most widely used copper alloys and a copper alloy that was previously submitted to a heat treatment. Simulations results show that the two copper alloys most widely used lead to similar mold behavior. Besides, the material submitted to a heat treatment does not lead to a critical behavior but can lead to a necessity of more frequent <b>re-machining</b> of the mold...|$|E
