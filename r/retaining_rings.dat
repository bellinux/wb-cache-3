Spiral rings are provided with a removal notch to simplify the removal process. Spiral <b>Retaining</b> <b>Rings</b> can be economically produced in special alloys like stainless steel because the manufacturing process eliminates scrap.|$|E
50|$|For the Retaining Ring connection, {{a groove}} will be {{machined}} onto the pipe end {{to hold the}} <b>retaining</b> <b>ring.</b> The <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> is made of a segmented stainless steel ring covered by a steainless steel spring and is used to fix the flange. For the assembly, the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> flange has to be put onto the machined pipe end. The <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> has to be widened for getting it on the pipe end to snap into the before machined groove.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{several studies}} relating to fundamental characterization of CMP consumables in planarization processes. These are also evaluated with {{the purposes of}} minimizing environmental impact and reducing cost of ownership (COO). The first study is conducted to obtain the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> wear rate in a typical ILD CMP process and is specifically intended to investigate the effect of <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> materials and slot designs during the CMP process. The results show that <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> materials have effect on the COF, pad temperature and <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> wear rate, while <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> slot designs affect the pad surface abruptness. The second study is performed to compare the effect of different <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> slot designs on the slurry film thickness within the pad-wafer interface. A novel non-intrusive optical technique, dual emission UV-enhanced fluorescence (DEUVEF), was applied to accurately measure the film thickness of the slurry underneath the wafer during polishing. It is indicated that the optimized <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> slot design can significantly reduce the COO of CMP processes by increasing slurry utilization. A COF method is applied to measure the slurry mean residence time (MRT) during CMP. This technique uses transient COF data induced by a shift in slurry concentration to determine MRT. Variations in consumables as well as sliding velocity, pressure and slurry flow rate can affect the slurry MRT. One study in this dissertation focus {{on the effect of}} <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> slot designs on the slurry MRT. Another study compares the slurry MRT under same polishing conditions using pads with different groove width. Both studies are conducted on multiple sliding velocity, pressure and slurry flow rate variations to understand the characteristics of consumable designs. The method of measuring MRT during polishing presented in this dissertation can be easily applied in general CMP processes. The subsequent studies focus in the diamond conditioner discs characterization techniques. A newly developed method for determining active diamonds and aggressive diamonds on a diamond conditioner disc under a certain vertical load is elaborated in this dissertation. Later, this technique together with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging is implemented to analyze diamond pullout and fracture in CMP. Five different types of diamond conditioner discs are subjected to a novel accelerated wear test respectively to compare the extent of diamond pullout and fracture under the same conditioning conditio...|$|R
50|$|Self-locking <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> can be {{installed}} in a housing/bore or on a shaft that {{has not had a}} groove machined into it. Self-locking rings with no lug holes are impossible to remove without either destroying the ring or warping it out of specified tolerances.|$|E
50|$|Axially {{assembled}} <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> {{are installed}} into machined grooves in housings/bores (internal) or on shafts (external). These rings are manufactured with lug holes—small {{holes in the}} lugs of both axial internal and external retaining rings—that are used to install/remove them, using pliers designed for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Inverted <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> are a {{variation}} of axially assembled rings in which the lug holes are inverted to fit {{in the bottom of}} the groove. Inverting the lugs allows greater clearance on a shaft or in a housing and forms a higher uniform shoulder good for retaining bearings and other components with large corner radii or chamfers.|$|E
50|$|Removal of a worn tire is by {{machining}} out the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> {{and heating}} the tire to relax the interference fit.|$|R
50|$|The most usual {{cause of}} damage is drag braking on severe gradients. Because the brake blocks apply {{directly}} on the tire, it is heated up, relaxing the interference fit. It is not feasible to fit the tire with such a heavy interference as to eliminate this risk entirely, and the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> will ensure that the tire can only rotate on the wheel center, maintaining its alignment. In rare instances the rotation could be so severe as to wear the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> down till it breaks, which could result in derailment.|$|R
50|$|Dodge Military trucks had {{the first}} beadlocks, called Combat Wheels; The 'combat wheels' were a divided-rim, that used a {{bolted-on}} <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> replacing the normal split ring wheels.

50|$|A linear bushing is {{not usually}} pressed into a housing, but rather secured with a radial feature. Two such {{examples}} include two <b>retaining</b> <b>rings,</b> or a ring that is molded onto the OD of the bushing that matches with a groove in the housing. This is usually a more durable way to retain the bushing, because the forces acting on the bushing could press it out.|$|E
50|$|Constant section <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> (snap rings) {{feature a}} uniform, {{constant}} section. In other words, the material {{used to make}} the ring is the same width at any point along the circumference of the ring. When they are contracted or expanded, they take on an elliptical deformation. As a result, they contact the groove at three or more isolated points but never continuously around the periphery. These rings are made from either flat or round wire.|$|E

50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are press fitted on the axle journal by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 °C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller bearing, an axle collar is press fitted. The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the axle box is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile rubber sealing ring is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the axle box housing does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> is placed. The <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> is made of steel and is a press fit. The <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> ensures that the rear cover assembly is secured tightly between the axle collar and the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the collar and the bearings were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the axle. The axle box housing, which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is housed in the axle box housing. Axle box grease is filled in the axle box housing. Each axle box housing is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the axle box is placed on a housing which closes the axle box. The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|R

50|$|Some of {{the early}} CVCC engines {{had a problem with}} the {{auxiliary}} valves retaining collars vibrating loose. Once unscrewed, engine oil would leak from the valvetrain into the pre-combustion chamber, causing a sudden loss of power and massive amounts of smoke to emanate from the exhaust pipe. The condition simulated a blown engine, even though the needed repair was quite simple. Honda eventually came up with a fix involving metal <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> that slipped over the collars and prevented them from backing out of their threads.|$|E
50|$|In manufacturing, parts {{can not be}} {{produced}} to an exact dimension; as a result, if they are made on the low side of the tolerance, they will be loose or have play on the shaft when a standard ring is installed. If they are made on the high side of the tolerance, they will extend further into the groove and prevent a standard ring from being fully installed. Compensating for accumulated tolerances is what bowed <b>retaining</b> <b>rings</b> are designed to do, by acting as a spring once installed into the groove.|$|E

50|$|The tire is {{primarily}} {{held in place}} by its interference fit. The shoulder on the outside and the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> also keep the tire in place if the interference fit is lost. This is most often due to severe drag braking down a gradient, or due to an error in the machining.|$|R
50|$|The process uses an {{abrasive}} and corrosive chemical slurry (commonly a colloid) {{in conjunction}} with a polishing pad and <b>retaining</b> <b>ring,</b> typically of a greater diameter than the wafer. The pad and wafer are pressed together by a dynamic polishing head and held in place by a plastic <b>retaining</b> <b>ring.</b> The dynamic polishing head is rotated with different axes of rotation (i.e., not concentric). This removes material and tends to even out any irregular topography, making the wafer flat or planar. This may be necessary to set up the wafer for the formation of additional circuit elements. For example, CMP can bring the entire surface within the depth of field of a photolithography system, or selectively remove material based on its position. Typical depth-of-field requirements are down to Angstrom levels for the latest 22 nm technology.|$|R
