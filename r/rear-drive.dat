25|$|This {{would be}} the final year for the <b>rear-drive</b> LeSabre before another {{downsizing}} and conversion to front-wheel-drive for 1986 (sedans and coupes only; the <b>rear-drive</b> LeSabre Estate Wagon would soldier on unchanged a few more years). It was also the last LeSabre sedan and coupe to feature body-on-frame construction, V8 power and Buick's traditional all-coil suspension (the 1992–96 Roadmaster sedans would also be similarly built). The top-line LeSabre Limited became the LeSabre Limited Collectors Edition to {{mark the end of}} an era for the <b>rear-drive</b> sedan and coupe.|$|E
25|$|The Century GS model {{returned}} in 1986 {{for what was}} now Buick's front-drive intermediate-sized car (Regal continued as a coupe on the 1978-vintage <b>rear-drive</b> G-body until 1987). The GS was only offered as a two-door coupe and was powered by a fuel-injected 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 mated to a four-speed overdrive automatic transmission but with far less horsepower than the <b>rear-drive</b> Regal GN's turbocharged/intercooled version rated at 245 horsepower. This Century GS was a one-year-only offering in 1986 sold alongside the Century T-Type coupe and sedan.|$|E
25|$|Sales {{slowed to}} a trickle {{in the wake of}} the {{introduction}} of the Renault Alliance. These were more modern, space-efficient, fuel-efficient 4-cylinder, front-wheel-drive cars compared to the <b>rear-drive</b> Concord with its aging platform. The imported Renault 18-based 18i sedan Sportwagon sold by AMC/Jeep/Renault dealers were also more efficient replacements. All Concord and Spirit models were quietly dropped by the end of the 1983 model year. The future for AMC's Concord and Spirit series was sealed for the 1980s as <b>rear-drive</b> cars were replaced by front-drive models.|$|E
25|$|The model {{line was}} {{subsequently}} {{expanded to include}} the Roadster a rear-engine, <b>rear-drive</b> and four-door, four-seat supermini aptly named Forfour (the original City-Coupé was renamed Fortwo to fit the new naming scheme).|$|E
25|$|A badge {{engineered}} {{version of}} the Premier was added using a familiar Chrysler name, the Dodge Monaco, a moniker that was first used by Dodge in 1965 and last used in 1978 on a full-size, <b>rear-drive</b> sedan.|$|E
25|$|LeSabres were <b>rear-drive</b> six-passenger {{vehicles}} from 1959 to 1985 (station wagons through 1990) featuring separate body-on-frame construction {{along with}} a longitudinally mounted front engine. The first downsized generation of LeSabres introduced in 1977 retained the <b>rear-drive</b> and body-on-frame construction, while the later-generation models introduced in 1986 switched to front-wheel-drive, unit-body construction and transversely mounted engine. Convertibles were offered each year through 1975 while two- and four-door hardtops were dropped after 1976 and only pillared body styles were offered from 1977 to 2005. Station wagons were offered through 1964 and then dropped for several years until being reintroduced in 1970 and continued until 1990 after which year they were moved to the revived Roadmaster series. LeSabres come in two versions: Custom and Limited.|$|E
25|$|The earlier {{agreement}} between Chrysler and AMC in 1985, under which AMC would produce M-body chassis <b>rear-drive</b> large cars {{for two years}} from 1986–88, fed the rumor that Chrysler was about to buy AMC. According {{to the head of}} manufacturing for Chrysler at the time, Stephan Sharf, the existing relationship with AMC producing a car for a competitor facilitated the negotiations.|$|E
25|$|The thighs are broad, {{strong and}} muscular; broad, strong and muscular hindquarters, and proper angles between the stifles and hocks are {{essential}} for a draft dog to provide powerful <b>rear-drive</b> during movement. The breed standard 'bend of stifle' refers to where the upper and the lower thighs meet. The stifles are moderately bent and taper smoothly into the hocks. The hocks are well let down and straight when viewed from the rear. The hock joint corresponds to the human ankle and first short bones in the foot; the dog does not walk on the heel as people do. Feet are round and compact with well-arched toes; they turn neither in nor out. Dewclaws should be removed.|$|E
500|$|The Ford Pinto is a front-engine, <b>rear-drive</b> subcompact car {{manufactured}} {{and marketed}} by Ford Motor Company for model years 1971–1980. [...] The first subcompact developed by Ford in North America, the Pinto was marketed in two-door coupe (1971–1972), three-door hatchback (1971–1980), and three-door station wagon (1972–1980) body styles, {{and was the}} first mass-produced American car with rack and pinion steering.|$|E
500|$|Launched in 2006 after GM's 2003 {{abandonment}} {{of their last}} European <b>rear-drive</b> sedan, the Opel Omega, the VE is the first Commodore model designed entirely in Australia, {{as opposed to being}} based on an adapted Opel-sourced platform. Given this and high public expectations of quality, the budget in developing the car reportedly exceeded [...] Underpinned by the new Holden developed GM Zeta platform, the VE features more sophisticated independent suspension all round and near-even 50:50 weight distribution, leading to improved handling. Engines and transmissions are largely carried over from the previous VZ model. However, a new six-speed GM 6L80-E automatic transmission was introduced for V8 variants, replacing the old four-speed automatic now relegated to base models. The design of this new model included innovative features to help minimise export costs, such as a symmetrical centre console that houses a flush-fitting hand brake lever to facilitate its conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the Commodore is again badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina and Chevrolet Omega, along with its new export market in the United States as the Pontiac G8 (discontinued as of 2010 along with the Pontiac brand).|$|E

2500|$|For 1983, AMC {{introduced}} the new Renault Alliance, {{which was a}} much more modern, space-efficient, fuel-efficient, front-wheel-drive subcompact car than the <b>rear-drive</b> Spirit, with its 14-year-old platform. The Spirit was canceled as AMC released the Alliance-based Encore hatchbacks for 1984. In addition, the front-wheel drive Renault Fuego, [...] "a nicely executed sports coupe," [...] was also sold by AMC dealers {{as an alternative to}} the Spirit GT. The Fuego had distinctive styling, four passenger room, fuel economy (U.S. EPA rated at [...] on the highway), and it received good reviews in the automotive media.|$|E
2500|$|Slight {{interior}} cosmetic {{changes were}} also implemented for each new model year, and a full-length center console with floor-mounted shifter was available as an extra-cost option with the Strato bucket seats from 1968 to 1970, though few Toronados were so ordered. The {{vast majority of}} customers went for the standard Strato bench seat {{to take full advantage}} of the flatter floor resulting from the front-drive layout; the lack of a [...] "hump" [...] in the floor made three-abreast seating more comfortable than in <b>rear-drive</b> cars, as the center passengers both front and rear did not have to sit with their legs in an awkward position.|$|E
2500|$|All {{three were}} uni-body cars, dubbed the [...] "Y-body" [...] platform, {{combining}} {{the frame and}} body into a single construction, making them comparatively lighter and smaller. All three put into production new technology pushed by John DeLorean which GM {{had been working on}} for several years prior, but the Tempest was by far the most radical. A flexible steel shaft rotating at the speed of the engine delivered power from the front-mounted engine through a [...] "torque tube" [...] to a rear-mounted trans-axle. This innovation not only delivered close to a 50/50 front-rear weight distribution that drastically improved handling, it enabled four-wheel independent suspension which enhanced it even more. It also all but eliminated the large floor [...] "hump" [...] common to front-engined <b>rear-drive</b> cars.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{significant}} changes in 1985 as the market moved away from AMC's small models. With fuel relatively cheap again, buyers turned to larger more powerful automobiles and AMC was unprepared for this development. Even the venerable Jeep CJ-5 was dropped after a 60 Minutes TV news magazine exposé of rollover tendencies under extreme conditions. AMC also confronted an angry work force. Labor was taking revenge, and reports circulated about sabotage of vehicles on the assembly lines because of the failure to receive promised wage increases. There were rumors that the aging Kenosha plant was to be shut down. At the same time, Chrysler was having trouble meeting demand for its M-body <b>rear-drive</b> models (Dodge Diplomat, Plymouth Gran Fury and Chrysler Fifth Avenue). Because they were assembled using the old [...] "gate and buck system" [...] and the tooling could be easily moved, Chrysler could supply the components and control the quality, while AMC assembled the car. Therefore, Lee Iacocca and Joe Cappy reached an agreement {{to use some of}} AMC's idle plant capacity in Kenosha.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} deal, BRP {{retained}} {{rights to}} the sprocket logo, which it subsequently modified. [...] Its snowcats and snowmobiles dated back to {{the origins of the}} company; current brands are Ski-Doo and Lynx. Bombardier Recreational Products has also become well known for its Sea-Doo personal watercraft division which also features jet-powered sport boats. [...] Bombardier also makes all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). [...] In 2006, the Bombardier ATV was rebranded as Can-Am. Can-Am {{was the name of the}} line of dirt bikes it produced in the 1980s which used high-tech engines featuring Rotax Automatic Variable Exhaust (RAVE) valving to create peak power at a wider range of RPMs. [...] The bikes were shelved but technology tweaks re-emerged in the company's Ski-Doo snowmobiles (beginning with the 1989 model year Ski-Doo Mach 1). [...] Many of today's snowmobiles produced by the company feature proprietary engineering by BRP's Rotax brand engine production plant located in Austria. [...] BRP's Can-Am product is among the high tech recreational vehicles which include the Can-Am Spyder, a three-wheel roadster with a <b>rear-drive</b> wheel and featuring a vehicle stability system (VSS), anti-lock braking system (ABS) and other safety and electronic vehicle control enhancements as certified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).|$|E
2500|$|The 1979 Chevrolet Nova {{marked the}} end of the line for the rear-wheel-drive Nova. The front end was revised with square {{headlights}} and a new grille for the short run; [...] a modified horizontal-bar grille contained vertical parking lights. New chromed hood and fender moldings were installed, and new front-bumper filler panels gave the front end a more finished look. The lineup was the same as in 1978; the base-level hatchback, coupe, and sedan, plus the Custom coupe and sedan. As usual, base coupe and sedan proved to be the best sellers. Nova Customs had a special acoustical package including improved headlining and full hood insulation, along with other luxury extras, while the Rally Package returned, this time using the same grille as other '79 Novas. These final Novas were promoted for their [...] "solid value" [...] and [...] "reputation for dependability," [...] capitalizing upon a 17-year heritage that had begun with the Chevy II. Fewer than 98,000 examples were produced. [...] Regular production ended on December 22, 1978 but some cars badged [...] "Nova Custom" [...] were built on special order with luxury amenities in early 1979. The final Chevrolet Nova (Custom) built on special order would roll off the line in March 15, 1979 and this would be the end of the <b>rear-drive</b> Nova for good. Chevrolet's compact models were headed into the front-wheel-drive age and for 1980, Nova's place in the lineup would be taken over by the new and very different Chevrolet Citation.|$|E
2500|$|The Fleetwood {{departed}} the front-drive lineup for 1993 (as the Fleetwood name {{went on the}} new <b>rear-drive</b> {{replacement for}} the 1992 Brougham). Sixty Special continued in its front-wheel drive form, as it had since it was reintroduced in 1987, but {{this would be the}} last year. To visually differentiate the 1989–1993 DeVille from the upper-rung Fleetwood and Sixty-Special models, the front-drive Fleetwoods and Sixty Specials use fender-mounted [...] "spats" [...] or skirts over the rear wheels, while DeVille had full rear-wheel openings. For its final-year, there were 5,292 Sixty Specials built in 1993, including 688 with the optional [...] "Ultra" [...] Package that featured 22-way adjustable front seats, designed in Italy by Giorgio Guigiaro. This distinctive seating package had been standard on the Sixty Special since 1989, but in 1993, it became a $3,550.00 option. While it was based upon the DeVille, the Sixty Special included eleven items as standard equipment, while those eleven items were optional at extra cost on DeVilles, and in addition there were options for the Sixty Special, that were not available on the DeVille, such as [...] "Memory Seat" [...] for driver with two recall settings, an [...] "Exit" [...] button" [...] when pushed automatically powered the driver seat all the way rearward, and dual front seat power recliners. On the exterior the rear wheels were partially covered with the fender skirts, giving the car a longer and more [...] "formal" [...] look than the DeVille.|$|E
2500|$|From 1959 to 1961, the LeSabre was {{powered by}} a 364 cubic-inch V8, which was smaller than the 401 cubic-inch V8 used in the more {{expensive}} Invicta and Electra models. The 364, which was previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958, was rated at [...] in standard form with an [...] "economy" [...] version offered as a [...] "no cost" [...] option in 1960-61 and an optional power-pack version with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts that was rated at [...] For 1962-63, the LeSabre came standard with a two-barrel carbureted version of the 401 V8 rated at , or a no-cost [...] "economy" [...] low-compression version rated at [...] [...] Starting in 1964, all LeSabre models except the Estate Wagon shared their drivetrains with the midsize Buick models by switching to those models' smaller-displacement V8s at least as standard equipment {{for the next few}} years with cubic-inch displacements of 300 (1964–65), 340 (1966–67) and 350 (1968–76). A large-displacement would not reappear in a LeSabre until 1970 when a 455 cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option and was offered through 1976. Beginning with the downsized 1977 models and continuing through three subsequent generations of front-drive LeSabres introduced in 1986, 1992 and 2000, Buick's 3.8-liter (231 cubic-inch)V6 would become the standard engine for most LeSabre models and V8 engines were dropped (except in station wagons) after the last of the <b>rear-drive</b> LeSabre sedans and coupes came off the line in 1985.|$|E
