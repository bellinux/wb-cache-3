40|$|This study proposes an {{analytical}} model {{to relate the}} evolving microstructure of neat cement paste during hydration to the electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurement.</b> The model {{is based on the}} general effective media theory and considers the contributions of both the low-resistivity phase (capillary pores) and the high-resistivity phase (gels and solids) in cement-pastes. The major parameters in the proposed model are the microstructural properties such as capillary pore percolation threshold and pore structure parameter, capillary pore phase and solid-gel phase resistivities. To validate the model, an empirical relationship between the resistivity formation factors and the phase volume fractions of a series of cement pastes has been built up with the assistance of noncontact electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurement</b> and mercury intrusion porosimetry technique. The good agreement between the model and experimental data shows that it is feasible to obtain better understandings of the evolving microstructure of cement paste during the hydration using electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurement.</b> Furthermore, based on the log-linear increase of resistivity with time, the porosity up to an age of a few months can be predicted by the proposed model. The predicted results show a good correlation with the experimental results in previous studies...|$|R
50|$|In {{solid-state}} physics, Kondo insulators (also {{referred as}} Kondo semiconductors and heavy fermion semiconductors) are understood as materials with strongly correlated electrons, that {{open up a}} narrow band gap (in the order of 10 meV) at low temperatures with the chemical potential lying in the gap, whereas in heavy fermions the chemical potential {{is located in the}} conduction band. The band gap opens up at low temperatures due to hybridization of localized electrons (mostly f-electrons) with conduction electrons, a correlation effect known as the Kondo effect. As a consequence, a transition from metallic behavior to insulating behavior is seen in <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurements.</b> The band gap could be either direct or indirect. Most studied Kondo insulators are FeSi, Ce3Bi4Pt3, SmB6, YbB12, and CeNiSn.|$|E

50|$|Geological {{materials}} are generally poor electrical conductors {{and have a}} high resistivity. Hydrothermal fluids in the pores and fractures of the earth, however, increase the conductivity of the subsurface material. This change in conductivity is used to map the subsurface geology and estimate the subsurface material composition. <b>Resistivity</b> <b>measurements</b> are made using a series of probes distributed tens to hundreds of meters apart, to detect the electrical response of the Earth to injection of electrical impulses in order to reconstruct the distribution of electrical resistance in the rocks. Since flowing geothermal waters can be detected as zones of low resistance, {{it is possible to}} map geothermal resources using such a technique. However, care must be exercised when interpreting low resistivity zones since they may also be caused by changes in rock type and temperature.|$|E

During C-V measurements using a Schottky contact directly on HRSOI film we observed a bias spreading effect, where the capacitance was much higher than that due to the gate area. Effects of various factors such as frequency, contact size, light, temperature, and annealing are discussed. The challenges in accurate <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurement</b> using four-point probe, Hall method, and C-V profile are highlighted and a new approach using Impedance Spectroscopy to extract resistivity is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Porosity logs {{measure the}} {{fraction}} or percentage of pore volume in {{a volume of}} rock. Most porosity logs use either acoustic or nuclear technology. Acoustic logs measure characteristics of sound waves propagated through the well-bore environment. Nuclear logs utilize nuclear reactions {{that take place in}} the downhole logging instrument or in the formation. Nuclear logs include density logs and neutron logs, as well as gamma ray logs which are used for correlation. The basic principle behind the use of nuclear technology is that a neutron source placed near the formation whose porosity is being measured will result in neutrons being scattered by the hydrogen atoms, largely those present in the formation fluid. Since there is little difference in the neutrons scattered by hydrocarbons or water, the porosity measured gives a figure close to the true physical porosity whereas the figure obtained from electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurements</b> is that due to the conductive formation fluid. The difference between neutron porosity and electrical porosity measurements therefore indicates the presence of hydrocarbons in the formation fluid.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 The {{effects of}} steel reinforcement, chloride-induced {{corrosion}} initiation, cracking and delamination on the electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurements</b> using the Wenner probe technique were studied experimentally on custom-designed reinforced concrete slabs. Investigation parameters included (1) probe configurations {{with respect to}} rebar mesh, (2) rebar density, (3) epoxy coating on the rebar, (4) concrete cover thickness over embedded reinforcement, (5) chloride ingress, (6) corrosion of rebar, (7) crack and delamination properties, (8) probe configurations {{with respect to a}} crack, and (9) moisture content of concrete. The concrete moisture condition and cover thickness influenced the effect of rebar mesh. It was theorized that bound chlorides increased electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurements</b> and counteracted the effect of free chlorides. It was observed that epoxy coated rebar did not significantly affect measurements. Uncoated rebar affected <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurements,</b> particularly for saturated and semi-saturated concrete. Conductive cracks had no significant effect or under-measured electrical resistivity and insulative cracks either over-measured or under-measured electrical resistivity. However, surficial microcracking had no significant effect on electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurements.</b> Delamination of the concrete cover was detected by electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurements</b> for small concrete cover thicknesses.

40|$|Cementitious {{materials}} are porous medium. During the hydration of cement, the porosity is continuously reduced with the continue increase of reaction products. A {{better understanding of}} the development of microstructure during cement hydration is very important in view of its significant influence on the physical and mechanical behaviors of cement-based materials. This work is focused on the utilization of electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurement</b> for monitoring the hydration process and characterizing the microstructure properties of cementitious materials. A non-contact electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurement</b> method is used in the present work to continuously and accurately detect the resistivity evolution of cementitious system. The <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurement</b> is very sensitive to the change of ambient temperature. This influence has been successfully corrected by using the empirical equation and Arrhenius-based equation in this work. Thus, the resistivity is only affected by the internal change of specimen and a fair comparison of the resistivity data obtained at the varying temperatures can be carried out. After correcting the temperature influence, the non-contact <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurement</b> has been applied to monitor the hydration processes of different types of cement and to study the compatibility of superplasticizing admixtures with different cements. More details about hydration behavior of cement mixtures can be obtained by this measurement. The correlation and comparison between resistivity and ultrasonic methods in monitoring cement hydration have also been conducted. It concludes that the non-contact resistivity method provides a non-destructive and objective way to study the cementitious materials. Finally, a simple model based on the general effective media theory is proposed to realistically predict the microstructure parameters of cementitious materials using the resistivity results. The major parameters in the proposed model are the microstructural properties such as capillary pore threshold and pore structure parameter, capillary pore phase and solid-gel phase resistivities. To validate the model, an experimental relationship between the resistivity formation factors and the phase volume fractions of a series of cement pastes has been built up with the assistance of mercury intrusion porosimetry techniques. The good agreement between the model and experimental data shows that it is feasible to obtain better understandings of the evolving microstructure of cementitious materials during the hydration using electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurement.</b> Furthermore, based on the log-linear increase of resistivity with time, the porosity in mature stage can be predicted by the proposed model...|$|R

40|$|In this work, an {{overview}} of three different through-plane <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurement</b> methods accompanied with the in-plane <b>resistivity</b> <b>measurement</b> method is given and the methods thoroughly evaluated. It is found that {{the accuracy of the}} results is highly dependent on the measurement method. The gold coated electrodes reduce the electrical contact resistance (ECR) emerging between the electrodes and the GDL samples; however, it does not completely eliminate it. Measurement of the voltage drop across the GDLs directly on the GDL surfaces excludes contact resistances to the electrode. On the other hand, we find that the difference in the isolation area around the direct voltage-sense-probes in combination with the in-plane resistivity of the GDLs impacts the accuracy of the experimental results. Consequently, implementation of the direct voltage-sense-probes is recommended for accurate measurements with an isolation area as small as possible...|$|R
