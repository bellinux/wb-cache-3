Some of these were at first in full armor, and fought hard, generally with success; {{and there was a}} <b>revolving</b> <b>machine,</b> something like a squirrel's cage, in which the bear was always climbing after his enemy, and then rolling over by his own weight. Or hunters came, almost unarmed, and gaining the victory by swiftness and dexterity, throwing a piece of cloth over a lion's head, or disconcerting him by putting their fist down his throat. But it was not only skill, but death, that the Romans loved to see; and condemned criminals and deserters were reserved to feast the lions, and to entertain the populace with their various kinds of death. Among these condemned was many a Christian martyr, who witnessed a good confession before the savage-eyed multitude around the arena, and 'met the lion's gory mane' with a calm resolution and hopeful joy that the lookers-on could not understand. To see a Christian die, with upward gaze and hymns of joy on his tongue, was the most strange unaccountable sight the Coliseum could offer, and it was therefore the choicest, and reserved for {{the last part of the}} spectacles in which the brute creation had a part.|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore a {{practical}} method of <b>revolving</b> <b>machine’s</b> field balancing and solve problems that the requirement of revolver balancing is high and the process is complicated in practical engineering. The paper introduces balancing principle of rotating machinery’s static balance and dynamic balance based on vibration test, and applicable conditions of different balance method. The paper mainly analyzes implementation steps and operation method of three point method field balancing based on vibration test, indicates points for attention in the process. There is no need for complicated testing equipment, just with common vibration meter, simple and practicable. In addition it is balanced in actual using condition, there won’t be problem that new imbalance comes into being after installation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Total scalp {{avulsion}} is {{a serious}} injury, commonly occurring in Indian females working with industrial and agricultural machines. Their long hairs often get caught in a rapidly <b>revolving</b> <b>machines,</b> resulting in total avulsion of scalp. Lack of education and awareness in Indian villages often result in these patients coming late to the hospitals when replantation is not possible and scalp reconstruction remains the only available option. Materials and Methods: We performed our study on 22 cases of scalp avulsion injury presented to us between June 2007 and April 2012 at Department of Burn, Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery, SMS Hospital, Jaipur. In all of them a free tissue transfer was performed as an elective procedure. Results: Twenty two patients underwent free tissue transfer and followed up for an average period of 6 months. All patients {{included in this study}} were females with mean age of 28 yrs. Five patients in our study reported with partial necrosis of the free flaps which were subsequently managed with split-thickness skin graft (STSG). Two patients reported total necrosis of the flap which was re-operated using latissimus dorsi along with serratus anterior muscle (LDSA) from the contralateral side. Conclusion: As scalp avulsion because of rapidly rotating machine leads to large size defect not amenable for local tissue reconstruction. We performed reconstruction using LDSA and omental free flaps with split thickness skin graft (STSG) for large scalp defect and achieved good and stable soft tissue cover with satisfactory cosmesis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{analyzes}} the close-circuit Brayton (Joule) cycles for High Temperature Gas (Helium) cooled nuclear Reactors (HTGR). Analyzed cycles are with Regenerative Heat Exchanger (RHE), Fragmented Compression and Inter-Cooling (FC&IC). The HTGR imposes the working agent and hot source’s parameters. The cooling conditions give the cycle’s minimal temperature. In the 1 st paper’s section, for ideal processes cycles, we show that: A) the boundary parameters and design schemes inflict: A 1) the compression ratios (ε), A 2) the specific net work per 1 kg He (wnet), and A 3) the thermal efficiencies (ηth); B) the performances are increasing with the IC’s number. In the 2 nd section {{we are taking}} into consideration the irreversibility’s factors (temperature difference at RHE, <b>revolving</b> <b>machines</b> isentropic efficiencies, and pressure drops) doing sensitivity analyses about their influences on real processes cycle’s performances. We show that: 1) cycle’s performances are not continuous growing with IC’s number, and 2) the main influences on design’s option are given by: 21) the temperature difference at RHE and 22) the pressure drops. In the 3 rd section we adjusted all the quality factors in a similar manner, reducing the irreversibilities, showing the synergic influences. The 4 th section relaxes the hot source’s restrictions. It analyses the influence of HTGR output / input temperatures variation on the main thermodynamic data, showing: α) the benefit of maximal temperature increase and β) the need to correlate HTGR’s temperature increment output vs. input with the maximal temperature. The final section contains the main conclusions of the paper...|$|R

Among {{the other}} machinery were two large flat work ironers, an [...] handkerchief ironer, two drying tumblers, nine pressing machines, and a curtain dryer. The clothing was washed in <b>revolving</b> <b>machines,</b> in filtered water with pure soap, and rinsed five times. The wringers were centrifugal. The thermostatic control heater kept {{the water at}} all times less than 180 degrees, while the water filtering tanks removed the elements harmful to linens and other materials. The room next to that in which these tanks were located {{on the second floor}} was the store room, which contained barrels of starch, automobile tires, paper boxes, and almost a ton of twine. There was a large dryer, made especially for bath towels, which dried them by a hot air process. The flat work was protected in the mangles by canvas belts and aprons. Men's shirts were mended and the cuffs turned if worn along the fold. Stockings were dried and shaped at the same time on metal forms. A stiff collar required more steps {{in the process of being}} laundried than any other article. Two tanks, each of 1400 gallons capacity, contained soap flakes with the appropriate amount of water. These 2800 gallons lasted only two days at the most. The rough-dry work was done in a different part of the building, and the accounting for this department were kept separately.

One of the patients completely ruptured the index extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and the extensor indicis proprius (EIP) tendons at the musclotendinous junction of dorsal forearm. In this patient, the distal stump of the index EDC tendon was sutured to the middle EDC tendon in an end-to-side juncture.

In both cases, surgical intervention enabled the patients to extend their index fingers almost normally; however, the former complained of inability to extend his index finger independently. Tendon transfer of the EDM in cases of index extensor tendon rupture at the musclotendinous junction is a good method to restore ability to independently extend the index finger.

40|$|Society is {{constituted}} of the physical, imaginative, virtual, flowing {{and arrested}} movement of people, and this movement is facilitated by an ever-expanding list of technology, including planes, trains, buses, modems, bicycles, and cars. A sociology of mobilities {{is the study}} of society that recognizes its mobile nature and seeks to understand the movement of which it is comprised. In much of the contemporary world, and especially the United States, the automobile dominates the landscape of mobility. Modem social, economic and emotional lives <b>revolve</b> around these <b>machines.</b> The growing density of cities, increasing shortages of oil and developing threat of global warming make it clear that this massive, dominating car system is on the way out. On the other hand, car use is not in decline. Car use, rather, is expanding both spatially and quantitatively around the world. This contradiction points to the social and emotional forces that drive car use. These forces form a deep-seated social system that must be understood in order to comprehend the political issues of regulating car use and pushing towards sustainable transit. The author explores how an integrated social and material understanding of automobility can be used to develop an accurate picture of the political debate over automobility and potential changes to the car system. The current debate over congestion pricing (a system of charging for road use at peak times), urban planning and regulating car use in New York City can illuminate this question about how dearly held values and social ways are being implicated in a modal shift from automobility as we know it to a more sustainable system. This particular debate in New York City and the wider issues of social relations and politics of car use can best be understood within the larger framework and methodologies of the sociology of mobilities. Also considered are different theoretical aspects of automobility and how they fit into a wider conception of modernity...|$|R

When the solution is substantially clear it is slowly added, a pail at a time (3 gallons) {{by means of a}} 2 quart dipper, to the heated stearic acid as prepared in 1. The oil burner is kept on during this operation {{in order to keep the}} temperature of the mixture fairly constant at 360 degrees F. Care must be exercised in adding this [...] "Saponifying" [...] solution so that excess foaming is prevented. After all the solution has been added the resulting [...] "formula wax" [...] is heated to 400 degrees F. and maintained at this temperature for four hours, at which time a sample is removed, a congealing point determined, (see under [...] "tests"), and any addition made of stearic acid or sodium carbonate solution for correction, and the mixture held without additional heat for 10 hours. It is then heated again to bring the temperature up to 400 degrees F and allowed to cool gradually, usually overnight. When the temperature has again been reduced to 350 degrees F the wax is pumped by means of a Kinney pump into 10 gallon pails from which the wax is poured into shallow pans containing approximately 50 lbs of the wax per pan. After the material has cooled to room temperature it is removed from the pans and stacked. [...] 3. Into a 200-gallon cast iron cauldron heated by and oil burner of the household type, (or as required at present by war conditions, heated by bituminous coal) are placed 500 to 900 labs of [...] "formula wax". Note: The amount of [...] "formula wax" [...] to make up a batch various according to the amount of scrap wax which is to be added to the cauldron. Scrap wax represents commercial wax of which [...] "formula wax" [...] is a part. To the amount of [...] "formula wax placed in the cauldron are added 19½% Paraffin (133 degrees-135 degrees F., usual source Standard Oil of New Jersey) and 2% stearine pitch (M. P. 40 Degrees Centigrade). This mixture, consisting of [...] "formula wax", paraffin and stearine pitch, represents commercial wax. Finally, commercial scrap wax of the composition given above in added until the total weight of the mixture is approximately 1,600 lbs. This mixture is usually heated beginning at 12 midnight and carried through until the temperature is 410-415 degrees F. at 8 a.m. Note; This may be regarded as standard procedure, although at the present time (Dec., 1943) this has been modified so that only Sunday nights is this done. On other days of the week except Saturday the kettles are started at 6 A.M. This method was adopted due to man shortages which necessitated starting the molding operation later in the day.) At this time a congealing point is taken and the necessary adjustments made (see under [...] "tests") after which the mixture is transferred to a closed agitating tank by means of a Kinney pump, the latter forced the hot material through a 2" [...] pipe. [...] 4. To the mixture in the agitation tank there is added 3/10 percent Johns-Manville # 503 Filter Aid. The temperature is maintained at 375 degrees F. by means of a ring gas burner, at the bottom of the tank. At this temperature the wax is supplied by a Worthington pump at 30 lbs to a one square foot Shriver press whose head and follower are steam jacketed and which has 7 sections. The effluent from this press passes through a second Shriver press which has 2 sections of one square foot each. The mixture from the outlet here finally passes though a 1" [...] pipe which has a 100 × 150 mesh Monel, metal screen held in its cross sections by means of a union, into one of four 75 gallon aluminum kettles[...] These kettles are protected by conical hoods to prevent dust particles being carried into the body of the wax. After allowing the wax to remain at 330 degrees F. for three hours it is ready to be poured into the blank moulds. The temperature is maintained by gas burners beneath the kettles and controlled automatically by Partlow Corp. thermostatic controls. [...] 5. By means of a pot with 2 spouts the moulds are filled with molten wax. The pot has a capacity of about five pounds (slightly less than 2 quarts and is specially designed of aluminum and made by Theodore Walter, Newark N.J... The molding table revolves at the rate of 6 blanks per minute, approximately, and the size of the pouring pot spout is only sufficient to permit the hot wax to flow into the molds at a rate slightly faster than the speed of the molds which rotate past a given point around the table. [...] The blanks are extracted at a temperature of 200-205 degrees F. and place on boards which hold 30 blanks. These boards when filled move by gravity down a conveyor. The length of time on the conveyor is about two hours after which time they are sufficiently cool and hard to be put into production boxes holding 63 blanks. The boxes are placed in racks for the following day's production. Into each production box there is placed a semi-finished cylinder, which has been edged and reamed and which conforms to a standard internal diameter at 70 degrees F of 1.826 [...] " [...] at the thin end. The purpose of this is to permit the edging operation to take place on the un-finished blank at any temperature by adjusting the machine to conform to the standard. Thus, in each production box, there is a total of 63 unfinished cylinders. One day's production is held at least 34 hours before further processing. 6. The blanks are first reamed. The reamer consists of a twisted tapered and eight fluted tool. The blanks are forced on the reamer by hand to a stop. The position of the stop is adjusted so that sufficient material will be removed from both ends of the blanks when the blank is edged in the next operation. The reamer revolves at approximately 300 RPM. 7. The edging operation consists in placing a reamed blank on a tapered mandrel and by means of two special cutters working in unison the ends of the blank are formed to conform in couture to a standard template. A second gauge is used to insure proper length (6⅛"). IN each case the edged blank must rest on a tapered mandrel gauge in exactly the same position as the standard blank which is in the production box. The usual procedure is to make the necessary adjustments of the knives of the first blank which is edged so that is conforms to the standard, and then continue the operation on the rest of the blanks in the production box at the identical position of the first blank. Note; since there are 63 blanks for each standard blank it will be observed that every 63rd cylinder is checked mandrel gauge. The accuracy of the method and the facility with which it is done depend on the care and skill of the operator. This is the most critical of all the operations. The edging <b>machine</b> <b>revolves</b> at 2,200 RPM. 8. Following the edging operation is the stamping. This consists in applying a hot printing die to the thick end of the cylinder as it is placed accurately in a vertical position under the die. The heating of the die is done by means of a resistance wire coiled within a hollow torus near the under edge of the circular die. The coiled wire is connected to a source of current and the latter is adjusted by means of a rheostat. The heated died has raised lettering and makes and impression on the end surface of the wax cylinder. The depressed positive lettering on the cylinder is filled with a thick paste of zinc carbonate, the excess of which is brushed or wiped off after drying. [...] 9. The cylinders are next shaved on a ganged shaving machine consisting of a rough shaving knife free from [...] "blinds" [...] and [...] "lines", accurate concentricity and a minimum of taper. These factors depend on the tension of the driving belt, tension upon the rotating mandrel between centers and the position and sharpness of the knives. The speed of the mandrel is around 2,200 RPM. 10. The finished cylinders are placed in boxes which contain 16 pegs and run down a conveyor. At a point on this conveyor the cylinders are held and brushed on the inside to remove wax shavings and dust. [...] 11. Cylinders are inspected, packed and placed in the stock room for a minimum of thirty days before shipping. [...] 12. The reinforcing liners are made as follows: Crinoline cloth of specifications given under [...] "Tests", are cut into a trapezoid (Paper Products Dept.) base length 6¼, altitude 5⅝" [...] top length 5¾". A pack of these are placed in a vise edgewise and thinned glue, one part Le Pages Glue, one part water, brushed onto one slant edge. A liner is then wrapped a tapered mandrel of such size as to fit no too snugly on the molding core. The liner is held on the mandrel by means of two jaws actuated by a foot lever and the lapped edges of the liner glued by means of a gas iron held for an instant along the line of the lap. J.W.
