40|$|Interactions of ioxynil (3, 5 -diiodo- 4 -hydroxybenzonitrile) with a {{pure culture}} of Erwinia carotovora grown in a glucose-simple salts medium were studied. Growth of E. carotovora was {{inhibited}} by ioxynil and, {{to a lesser}} extent, by its acid form at 25 and 50 μg/ml. Growth was not inhibited by the amide or ester forms of ioxynil or p-hydroxybenzonitrile at the same concentrations. E. carotovora could be trained to grow in 50 μg or higher concentrations of ioxynil per ml by serial transfers of the organism through increasing ioxynil concentrations. No degradation or detoxification of ioxynil was detected. Toxicity tests indicated that, in the adapted culture, cell-free supernatant fluid remained toxic to a nonadapted culture. Adaptation of E. carotovora resulted in a lengthened lag phase, a decreased growth rate, and very few adverse effects on the total population. The adapted <b>resistant</b> <b>culture</b> retained this characteristic only when ioxynil was present. Adaptation was demonstrated to be a physiological variation, not a selection of a mutant or of preexisting resistant cells. Ioxynil slightly stimulated the respiration rate of E. carotovora and moderately inhibited that of an adapted culture. Because the respiration rate of an adapted culture {{in the absence of}} ioxynil surpassed that of a parent culture still in the presence of ioxynil, a competition of two alternate routes of electron transport is implied.

We describe here a real-time PCR assay for detecting mutations in the Ser 91 codon of the gyrA gene of N. gonorrhoeae in urine specimens. We tested 96 urine samples collected along with Gonorrhea Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) urethral swab samples and compared the results with matched MICs of ciprofloxacin, as reported by the regional GISP laboratory. We then tested 100 urine specimens, known to be gonorrhea positive by nucleic acid amplification testing, provided by females to challenge the real-time PCR assay with urine specimens containing potentially less target DNA content than specimens from symptomatic males. With an MIC threshold of 0. 125 μg of ciprofloxacin/ml, our assay correctly identified resistance in 41 of 44 (93. 2 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 81. 3 to 98. 6 %) corresponding <b>resistant</b> <b>culture</b> specimens and correctly identified 51 of 51 (100 %; 95 % CI = 93. 0 to 100 %) susceptible specimens. One specimen did not amplify. The assay successfully amplified the gyrA amplicon and determined a susceptibility genotype in 72 of 100 (72 %) urine specimens collected from female patients. We developed an assay for detecting QRNG in urine specimens that correlated well with MIC results of cultured specimens and had moderate sensitivity with urine specimens. This methodology might fulfill the need for a QRNG detection system for urine specimens, a useful characteristic in the age of nucleic acid amplification testing for gonococcal infection...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a number}} of reports that {{bacteria}} which have been made resistant to antibiotics may be rendered normally susceptible by con-tact with sensitive organisms, with extracts of such organisms, or with culture filtrates. Some of these reports are mutually contradictory in important respects, and the results have not been reproducible regularly by other workers. Voureka (1948) found that when penicillin resistant staphylococci or streptococci were grown in mixed culture with penicillin sensitive pneumococci, staphylococci, streptococci, or Corynebacterium diphtheriae and then reisolated, a large propor-tion of the colonies were sensitive to penicillin. Surprisingly, organisms naturally resistant to penicillin, such as Salmonella typhosa, also were capable of "sensitizing " the penicillin resistant staphylococci. Further, it was not necessary that the two bacterial strains actually grow together since exposure of resistant staphylococci to the sensitizing strains for as little as five minutes at incubator, room, or refrigerator temperatures often sufficed. Lysates produced by bacteriophage or chemicals, and autolysates of various organ-isms also induced penicillin sensitivity as did exposure to chloramphenicol and to antisera (Voureka, 1951), or exposure to sublethal amounts of various toxic agents including peni-cillin (Voureka, 1952). Although some of the early observations of Voureka were confirmied by Winner (1948) and George and Pandalai (1949), they could not be repeated by Bennison and Schwabacher (1948).

40|$|Lactobacillus bulgaricus LT 4 (0448) is a {{lysogenic}} strain {{from which}} a temperate bacteriophage can be induced by mitomycin C or UV irradiation. Lactobacillus lactis CNRZ 326 is an indicator strain for the temperate phage 0448, but this strain lyses only {{in the presence of}} Ca 2 + ions. A <b>resistant</b> <b>culture</b> developed secondarily after phage lysis and grew normally in MRS broth but again lysed abruptly if Ca 2 + ions were added after two or three transfers. This behavior of the secondary culture and its subcultures is explained by a heterogeneous and fluctuating bacterial population, including clones identical to L. lactis 326, which were sensitive to 0448 and which formed rough colonies, as does the indicator. The proportion of these clones increased in the course of transfers in MRS, explaining lysis when Ca 2 + was added. The population also included clones which formed smooth colonies (S clones). SI clones, which could not be induced by mitomycin C, were the major type in the initial culture, although they were sensitive to temperate phage 0448. The SI population then decreased and was gradually replaced by SII clones, inducible by mitomycin C and resistant to 0448. These SII clones were lysogenized clones, 326 (0448), whose stability was confirmed by growth in the presence of an antiphage serum. When L. bulgaricus LT 4 (0448) was treated with mitomycin C, several cured LT 4 clones were obtained that were related to the clones of the indicator L. lactis 326; they formed rough colonies. They also became sensitive to lytic phages or temperate phages active against L. lactis 326 and insensitive to lytic phages which lysed L. bulgaricus LT 4 (0448). This suggests that phage 0448 can lead to a lysogenic conversion of host strain LT 4...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} century, the {{concepts}} of emergency management and disaster planning have evolved and shifted from reactionary and event-based to precautionary and focused on all hazards. The existence of an emergency management program in jurisdictions such as cities and towns has become necessary {{for the protection of}} lives and property from natural and human-caused hazards. Recent disasters, such as the events of September 11, 2001, Hurricane Katrina, and the Virginia Tech shootings, have emphasized the need for disaster planning not only in cities and towns, but also at universities and colleges across the country. Implementing an emergency management and disaster planning structure and instilling a disaster <b>resistant</b> <b>culture</b> throughout a campus community has become important to maintaining the mission, vision, and essential functions of a university. The University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW), located on the coast of Southeastern North Carolina, is vulnerable to a multitude of hazards including hurricanes and severe weather, technological disasters such as power outages and hazardous materials spills, and acts of violence. UNCW’s location and status as an institute of higher education create vulnerabilities for the university that could threaten its property and the members of its community. Therefore, UNCW is in need of a response plan that details university emergency operations for any major disaster that may affect the campus. This project describes the process of writing and implementing the UNCW all hazards Emergency Operations Plan, including the emergency exercise program developed to accompany and test the plan. The project also explains challenges and issues associated with creating the plan, such as overcoming the “Disaster du Jour Syndrome,” and future steps for adopting and executing the plan. With a comprehensive and practiced all hazards Emergency Operations Plan, UNCW is now better prepared to respond to any disaster that may affect the campus. By continuing the development of its emergency management program and applying the plan when necessary, UNCW can continue its mission and vision even in times of crisis...|$|E
40|$|Outer {{membrane}} vesicles are {{an important}} constitutive product of all Gram-negative bacteria. Bacteria have evolved many responses to alleviate all different types of stress. The primary objective of this dissertation is to investigate the role of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as a method by which Gram-negative bacteria can quickly act to protect themselves against particular threats. Generally, we find that stressors whose primary effect is on the outer membrane can be protected against by OMVs. Throughout this study, {{a variety of different}} microbiological and biochemical methods are used to answer key questions in the innate ability of OMVs to protect against particular antimicrobials. Using Escherichia coli as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa as model organisms we tested the ability of purified vesicles from each species to protect themselves and other hosts. Using bacteriophage T 4, we investigated the ability of OMVs purified from E. coli to adsorb phage as well as how this interaction affected the efficiency of infection. We found that OMVs are protective against antimicrobial peptides, as well as bacteriophage. In the course of understanding this protection we also observed and characterized the cross species effects of both OMV protection as well as phage infection. Where typically a phage infects a specific species, we found that T 4 associated OMVs treating a non-native host P. aeruginosa resulted in the production of a novel prophage. Upon further examination, we determined that this induction was occurring via a novel pathway that we attempted to further characterize by performing a genetic screen to identify genes important to this induction. The work within this dissertation fully supports the hypothesis of a regulated response to outer membrane acting stimuli, resulting in the induction of vesiculation and the adsorption of stressor in the extra-cellular milieu. This model of protection agrees {{with the idea of a}} bacterial innate defense system, which acts in the short term before the adaptive response can fully occur, resulting in a bridge between the untreated to the treated and <b>resistant</b> <b>culture.</b> Dissertatio...|$|E

The decrease in d-cycloserine transport could be prevented by simultaneous treatment of the cells with rifampin and d-cycloserine. d-Cycloserine was transported by the same system as glycine in B. subtilis. d-Cycloserine was able to exchange for intracellular glycine in both sensitive and resistant cells, suggesting that d-cycloserine is not excluded from the cell in <b>resistant</b> <b>cultures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Previous {{reports from}} the Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Centre, Madras, have {{described}} a comparison of four regimens (three of isoniazid alone and one of isoniazid plus PAS) {{in the treatment of}} pulmonary tuberculosis and an investigation of the serum isoniazid levels in the patients concerned. The present report studies the emergence of isoniazidresistant organisms in these patients during treatment. All patients with an unsatisfactory response to treatment yielded <b>resistant</b> <b>cultures,</b> showing that the isoniazid dosage was never too low to inhibit sensitive organisms. From the degree of resistance of the first <b>resistant</b> <b>cultures</b> and of the six-month cultures from the patients treated with isoniazid alone it was concluded that resistance emerged in two stages. In the first stage, very early in treatment, highly resistant mutant bacilli grew freely whatever the isoniazid dosage, but mutants of lower resistance were prevented from growing to an extent dependent on the peak isoniazid concentration in the serum. Consequently, when the isoniazid dosage was increased the proportion of patients with resistant organisms decreased, since fewer low-resistance strains were able to develop. In the second stage, organisms with relatively low resistance continued to multiply, though still partially inhibited by isoniazid, and became more resistant, particularly in slow inactivators. The first-stage events determined the results of treatment since, once resistance had emerged, its extent was unrelated to the patient’s eventual progress. These findings emphasize the importance of early intensive chemotherapy and adjustment of the isoniazid dosage according to peak serum concentrations rather than concentrations measured three or six hours after the dose. Concomitant administration of PAS prevented emergence of isoniazid resistance in many patients and in others delayed its emergence and reduced its degree, possibly because growth in the secondstage was slow...|$|R
40|$|Biochemical {{variations}} {{accompanying the}} acquisition of ethambutol (EMB) resistance in a single-step mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Ra were analyzed. Comparative analysis of phospholipids revealed a reduced content in the EMB-resistant strain, particularly in the cell membrane fraction. Significant alterations were observed in the individual phospholipid content and phospholipid fatty acyl group composition of whole cells and subcellular fractions. Quantitative changes were seen in the chemical constituents of the cell walls of <b>resistant</b> <b>cultures</b> in comparison with those of EMB-susceptible cultures of M. tuberculosis. Alterations in the binding of 1 -anilinonaphthalene- 8 -sulfonate to whole cells of an EMB-resistant strain indicated structural changes on the cell surface. Structural changes in the cell wall may {{play an important role}} in the resistance of M. tuberculosis H 37 Ra to EMB...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{investigate}} the cultural aspects of North Korea by examining the everyday lives of the people, a topic that has been a blind spot in the body of previous research on North Korea. Although there are ample studies on North Korea due to its significance for world peace, they are limited to military and political aspects. To look into the micro-aspects of the social practice of ordinary people in North Korea, the method of post-modern ethnography is adopted. In-depth interviews and participatory observation of North Korean refugees in a special high school for them were conducted by focusing on their experiences of viewing South Korean media, which is absolutely prohibited in North Korea. Watching South Korean media is a fad among young North Koreans these days, although it is seen as delinquent behaviour by the authorities and the young people have to take the risk of being caught and sent to jail. The viewing patterns of media in people’s daily lives {{may be one of the}} few indicators of social change in such closed societies as North Korea. Due to persistent poverty and pervasive corruption, social minorities exist without social care and control. Young people as a social minority are free to create their own <b>resistant</b> <b>culture</b> in the social underside. With little hope for the future, the visual fantasy of South Korean media allows youth to dream of an alternative way of life. Watching South Korean TV is not simply a means of entertainment or escaping from reality, but also a means of signifying social change. This audience study of young North Koreans is meaningful in the sense that a marginal activity like watching TV in a social minority group could signify major social changes in the most stagnant society in the world. This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{antibiotic}} resistance in environmental bacteria {{is a direct}} threat to public health. Therefore, it becomes necessary to understand the fate and transport {{of antibiotic}} and its resistant bacteria. This paper presents a mathematical model for spatial and temporal transport of fluoroquinolone and its resistant bacteria in the aquatic environment of the river. The model includes state variables for organic matter, fluoroquinolone, heavy metals, and susceptible and resistant bacteria in the water column and sediment bed. Resistant gene is the factor which makes bacteria resistant to a particular antibiotic and is majorly carried on plasmids. Plasmid-mediated resistance genes are transferable between different bacterial species through conjugation (horizontal resistance transfer). This model includes plasmid dynamics between susceptible and resistant bacteria by considering the rate of horizontal resistance gene transfer among bacteria and the rate of losing resistance (segregation). The model describes processes which comprise of advection, dispersion, degradation, adsorption, diffusion, settling, resuspension, microbial growth, segregation, and transfer of resistance genes. The mathematical equations were solved by using numerical methods (implicit-explicit scheme) with appropriate boundary conditions. The development of the present model was motivated {{by the fact that the}} Musi River is heavily impacted by antibiotic pollution which led to the development of antibiotic resistance in its aquatic environment. The model was simulated for hypothetical pollution scenarios to predict the future conditions under various pollution management alternatives. The simulation results of the model for different cases show that the concentration of antibiotic, the concentration of organic matter, segregation rate, and horizontal transfer rate are the governing factors in the variation of population density of resistant bacteria. The treatment of effluents for antibiotics might be costly for the bulk drug manufacturing industries, but the guidelines can be made to reduce the organic matter which can limit the growth rate of microbes and reduce the total microbial population in the river. The reduction in antibiotic concentration can reduce the selection pressure on bacteria and can limit the population of <b>resistant</b> <b>culture</b> and its influence zone in the river stretch; however, complete removal of antibiotics may not result in complete elimination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria...|$|E
40|$|At {{least two}} {{functionally}} {{different types of}} ribosomes are found in strains of Staphylococcus aureus which display “dissociated” resistance to erythromycin. One type of ribosome is found under conditions of growth in ordinary nutrient broth, {{and the second is}} formed during growth in the presence of erythromycin. In these strains, erythromycin acts as an inducer of resistance to three different classes of inhibitors of the 50 S ribosomal subunit—the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics. The optimal inducing concentration of erythromycin is between 10 − 8 and 10 − 7 m. Concentrations as low as 10 − 9 m can produce a 10 -fold increase in resistant cells over the uninduced, background level, whereas concentrations greater than 10 − 7 m block induction owing to inhibition of protein synthesis. Resistant cells begin to appear within 5 to 10 min after addition of erythromycin (to 10 − 7 m), and within 40 min (i. e., about one generation) more than 90 % of the entire culture is resistant to erythromycin as well as to lincomycin and vernamycin Bα. A <b>resistant</b> <b>culture</b> becomes sensitive if grown for 90 min in the absence of erythromycin. The process of induction is inhibited by chloramphenicol and streptovaricin, which inhibit protein and ribonucleic acid synthesis, respectively, but not by novobiocin, which inhibits deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. Resistant cells produced in this manner fail to concentrate 14 C-erythromycin and 14 C-lincomycin, but not 14 C-chloramphenicol. Constitutively erythromycin-resistant strains which do not require the presence of erythromycin for expression of resistance can be selected on media containing antibiotics which belong to any one of the three classes. Two patterns of constitutive resistance have been found. These are (i) generalized constitutive resistance—which involves resistance in the absence of erythromycin to all members of each of the three cited classes of 50 S subunit inhibitors which were tested, and (ii) partial constitutive resistance—which involves different degrees of resistance, in the absence of erythromycin, to various members of the three classes. Several different patterns of variable constitutivity are possible. 50 S ribosomal subunits isolated from induced or constitutively resistant cells show decreased ability to bind erythromycin and lincomycin, and possible enzymatic inactivation of these antibiotics has been rigorously excluded. The induced change, therefore involves modification of ribosome structure rather than modification of the antibiotic...|$|E
40|$|A {{microbiological}} {{study of}} 25 cases of ovine footrot was performed. Cultures belonging to Dichelobacter nodosus were isolated in 48 % of the sampled animals. The {{sensitivity of the}} 99 strict anaerobic bacterial isolates to 5 antibiotics (penicillin G, amoxycillin, spiramycin, erythromycin and oxytetracycline) was studied. The percentage of <b>resistant</b> <b>cultures</b> was in all cases higher than 30 %. The efficacy of erythromycin and oxytetracycline {{in the treatment of}} ovine footrot was studied. To conduct this test, an intramuscular injection was applied, of one antimicrobial or the other, {{at the beginning of the}} treatment. The tolerance of animals to the antimicrobials, the success rate of treatment and the severity of lameness were evaluated. The percentage of animals cured within 15 days was around 75 %. In contrast, only 44 % improvement was achieved in the lameness. No differences were found between the two antimicrobials in the above indices...|$|R

Bacteriol. 84 : 370 – 374. 1962. —A {{comparison of}} the extracellular products of glucose metabolism during aerobic exponential growth of Escherichia coli showed that a streptomycin-dependent strain produced large amounts of l-valine while only trace amounts of this amino acid were produced by streptomycin-sensitive strains. A further difference between sensitive and dependent mutants was the production by the latter of lactic acid when the gas phase was changed from air to nitrogen. <b>Resistant</b> <b>cultures</b> grown in antibiotic-free medium were similar to sensitive cultures, but when dihydrostreptomycin was added, the resistant organism produced lactic and pyruvic acids. Three strains of streptomycin-sensitive E. coli accumulated pyruvic acid from glucose oxidation {{in the presence of}} concentrations of dihydrostreptomycin which inhibited multiplication. Further evidence is thus provided to implicate reactions of pyruvate as being of significance in the mechanism of action of streptomycin...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{infection}} with Candida glabrata in which the organism became resistant to fluconazole and in which pre- and posttreatment isolates were available for comparison. The organism was cross-resistant to ketoconazole and itraconazole, in common with other azole-resistant yeasts. Fluconazole was a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P- 450 -dependent 14 a-sterol demethylase (P- 450 DM) in lysates of cells from both susceptible and <b>resistant</b> <b>cultures</b> (50 %o inhibitory concentration, 0. 2 FM), indicating that resistance was unrelated to changes in P- 450 DM- Instead, it appeared to arise from a permeability barrier to fluconazole, since resistant celis were unable to take up radiolabelled drug. The azole (N-substituted imidazole or triazole) class of antifungal antibiotics is used commonly {{in the treatment of}} both superficial and deep-seated mycoses, including candi-diases (6). These drugs most probably work by inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis in fungal cells by binding to P- 450 -dependent 14 a-sterol demethylase (P- 450 DM), an important enzyme in ergosterol biosynthesis (7). This leads to the accumulation of methylated sterols, which are thought t...|$|R
