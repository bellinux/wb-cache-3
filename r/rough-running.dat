25|$|On the {{positive}} side, having two engines was a built-in insurance policy. Many pilots made it safely back to base after having an engine failure en route or in combat. On 3 March 1944, the first Allied fighters reached Berlin on a frustrated escort mission. Lieutenant Colonel Jack Jenkins of 55FG led {{the group of}} P-38H pilots, arriving with only half his force after flak damage and engine trouble took their toll. On the way into Berlin, Jenkins reported one <b>rough-running</b> engine, causing him to wonder if he would ever make it back. The B-17s {{he was supposed to}} escort never showed up, having turned back at Hamburg. Jenkins and his wingman were able to drop tanks and outrun enemy fighters to return home with three good engines between them.|$|E
500|$|Possibly as {{a result}} of <b>rough-running</b> of one or more of its engines, the Amana was {{observed}} flying over Perth's outer-eastern suburbs at an unusually low altitude. No witness report was received from anyone along the next [...] of the Amana's track from Perth's outer suburbs to within [...] of the crash site. In the minute before it crashed, eight witnesses heard a large aeroplane in distress and reported unusual engine noise, including engine noise ceasing on at least one occasion, followed by the sudden return of very loud engine noise. This suggested that, on at least one occasion, none of the engines were producing power, followed by a resumption of power on some of the engines. The investigation team concluded that the Amana failed to reach its assigned altitude of 9,000 feet, and that it experienced intermittent engine problems of such severity that all engine power was lost on at least one occasion. Without power and with only one of its propellers feathered, a Douglas DC-4 loses altitude at a great rate, possibly as fast as 100 feet per second (6,000 feet per minute).|$|E
50|$|Early 90° V6 engines {{derived from}} V8 engines had three shared {{crankpins}} arranged at 120° from each other. Since the cylinder banks were arranged at 90° to each other, {{this resulted in}} a firing pattern with groups of two cylinders separated by 90° of rotation, and groups separated by 150° of rotation, causing a notorious odd-firing behavior, with cylinders firing at alternating 90° and 150° intervals. The uneven firing intervals resulted in <b>rough-running</b> engines with unpleasant harmonic vibrations at certain engine speeds.|$|E

50|$|Butler scored {{an early}} Silver Crown win at the Hulman 100 (Indianapolis). This race was Steve's final USAC victory and {{included}} a special twist: Butler {{was forced to}} perform in-cockpit diagnosis and repair of a problem that was causing the engine to misfire. At mid-race, the <b>rough-running</b> engine was causing Butler to fade back into the pack and was threatening his ability to even finish. However, during a caution period, Butler was {{able to identify the}} problem as a faulty ignition switch. He then disconnected the switch and secured the bare wire by tying it off around a hydraulic hose, thereby preventing the exposed strands from shorting out. All this was accomplished on the race track, while driving with one hand and repairing with the other. With full power restored, Butler charged into the lead and defeated Ron Shuman by 10 seconds at the checkered flag.|$|E
5000|$|... 1962 saw the {{introduction}} of the Buick Special, which offered a new 90° V6 with uneven firing intervals that was derived from—and shared some parts commonality with—a small Buick V8 engine of the period. To save design time and expense, it was built much like a V8 that had two cylinders chopped off. The combination of a 90° V-angle with only three crank pins—set at 120° apart, with opposing cylinders sharing a crank pin as most V8 engines do—the cylinders fired alternatively at 90 and 150° of crankshaft rotation. This uneven firing caused harmonic vibrations in the drive train that were perceived as a <b>rough-running</b> engine by the buyers. GM sold the engine tooling to Kaiser-Jeep in 1967; later, {{as a result of the}} 1973 oil crisis, GM repurchased the tooling in 1974. In 1977, Buick introduced a split pin crankshaft to implement an even-fire version of this engine in which cylinders fired consistently every 120°.|$|E

No witness report was received from anyone along the next 16 nmi km of the Amana's track from Perth's outer suburbs to within 5 nmi km of the crash site. In the minute before it crashed, eight witnesses heard a large aeroplane in distress and reported unusual engine noise, including engine noise ceasing on at least one occasion, followed by the sudden return of very loud engine noise.

50|$|When Lancia {{pioneered the}} 60° V6 in 1950, {{they used a}} 60° angle between the {{cylinder}} banks and a six-throw crankshaft to achieve equally spaced firing intervals of 120°. This still has some balance and secondary vibration problems. When Buick designed a 90° V6 based on their 90° V8, they initially used a simpler three-throw crankshaft {{laid out in the}} same manner as the V8 with pairs of connecting rods sharing the same crankpin, which resulted in firing intervals alternating between 90° and 150°. This produced a <b>rough-running</b> design which was unacceptable to many customers. Arguably, the roughness is in the exhaust note, rather than noticeable vibration, so the perceived smoothness is rather good at higher RPM. Later, Buick and other manufacturers refined the design by using a split-pin crankshaft which achieved a regular 120° firing interval by staggering adjacent crankpins by 15° in opposite directions to eliminate the uneven firing and make the engine reasonably smooth. Some manufacturers such as Buick in later versions of their V6 and Mercedes Benz have taken the 90° design a step further by adding a balancing shaft to offset the primary vibrations and produce an almost fully balanced engine.|$|E
5000|$|The third-generation car {{was sold}} in the United States for just five years, from 1988 through 1992. The car sold poorly, despite {{construction}} [...] "as tight as a frozen head bolt" [...] and attractive styling for the market segment, perhaps because of its high price, few dealerships, <b>rough-running</b> three-cylinder, low performance (0-60 mph in 15 seconds), Toyota, which had recently procured a controlling interest in Daihatsu, withdrew all Daihatsu-badged cars from the US market. Sales for 1989 were 15,118. Only the three-door hatchbacks and four-door sedans were available. The North American Charade appeared in three different trim levels until 1989; the CES (base model), CLS, and CLX. The CES came with a , 1.0-litre three-cylinder, fuel injected engine called the CB90. The other two variants were available with the standard CB90 or the more powerful 1.3-litre four-cylinder SOHC 16-valve fuel injected, all-aluminum HC-E engine. In 1990, the trim levels were reduced to just two, the SE (base) and more luxurious SX. Four-cylinder models were available with a five-speed manual gearbox or a three-speed automatic transmission, while three-cylinder models were offered with the manual transmission only.|$|E
50|$|On 1 September, Taplin {{became a}} balloon buster, {{destroying}} a German observation balloon over Fromelles. The next day, he shot down and wrecked a Halberstadt recon plane east of Aubers. He then ruined a balloon {{on the morning}} of 3 September, and destroyed another that same evening. Two days later, he destroyed his fourth balloon in the morning, and sent a Fokker D.VII out of control in the evening. This dogfight ended his combat career. Outnumbered by a ratio of five or six to one, Taplin and his three squadronmates fell under the guns of German fighters from Jasta 26 and Jasta 27. As the fight began at 15000 ft, Taplin was shot through the right hand by German ace Christian Mesch, breaking Taplin's wrist and causing him to throw his Camel into a stall. He recovered with his left hand, then downed the Fokker that was his final win. He was then hit by another burst of fire that shattered the breech of his machine gun and sliced a shard of shrapnel into his nose. The stunned Taplin tumbled to 1000 ft altitude, followed by two Germans. After a skirmish with the Germans, which was settled by Taplin shooting down one of the Germans and chasing the other off, Taplin was no longer engaged by his aerial enemies. By now, the Australian was down to 100 ft, coping with a <b>rough-running</b> engine and one-handed piloting, and exposed to ground fire. The wounded pilot and his damaged Camel endured several miles of small arms fire while attempting to return to friendly lines. Taplin crashed several hundred yards short of the German front lines and was taken prisoner.|$|E
