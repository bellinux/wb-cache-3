50|$|The {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>jack</b> men use simple lever-type jacks {{to lift the}} car and permit the {{changing}} of tyres. The job of the front jack man is considered the most hazardous, as it requires standing {{directly in front of}} the car as it enters its pit box. By contrast, due to the location of his duties directly behind the car, the <b>rear</b> <b>jack</b> man is the only team member not in his working position before the car enters its pit box. Some teams even have two spare front and <b>rear</b> <b>jack</b> men for replacement.|$|R

50|$|Microtunnel boring {{machines}} {{are very similar}} to tunnel {{boring machines}} (TBM) but on a smaller scale. These machines generally vary from 0.61 to 1.5 m but smaller and larger machines have existed. Usually the operator controls the machine from a control room {{on the surface of the}} ground. The Microtunneling machine and jacking frame are set up in a shaft at the required depth. The operator is given constant feedback about the machine’s location, orientation and hydraulic devices via a computer console or CCTV camera. Most machines also have video cameras set up to enable the operator to monitor activities in the <b>jacking</b> <b>shaft</b> and at the separation plant. The operator controls the MTBM and the jacking frame from the safety of the control room which is usually situated on the surface, next to the <b>jacking</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Power gas {{locomotive}} {{was built}} by Gotaverken. It had a vertical, five cylinder, two-stroke diesel engine with opposed pistons. There was a single crankshaft connected to both upper and lower pistons. The exhaust from the diesel engine powered the gas turbine which drove the wheels through reduction gearing, <b>jack</b> <b>shaft</b> and side rods.|$|R
50|$|In 1908 and 1909 Krauss {{supplied}} 29 locomotives with {{a conventional}} outside driving gear, which nevertheless used a <b>jack</b> <b>shaft</b> between the main axles. They were given locomotive numbers 4507 - 4535. This driving gear enabled the water tank {{to be located}} below the boiler in the frame, {{so that there was}} more space on the gangways.|$|R
50|$|The engine (with {{electric}} starter) {{is connected}} to the hydraulic transmission by a torsionally flexible clutch and a short articulated drive shaft. The reversing gear is directly connected to the hydraulic transmission and drives the <b>jack</b> <b>shaft.</b> The torque is transmitted by side rods to the wheels. A belt drive from the engine drives the radiator fan, the air compressor and the alternator.|$|R
5000|$|In general, as {{with flat}} belts, rope drives {{were used for}} {{connections}} from stationary engines to the <b>jack</b> <b>shafts</b> and line shafts of mills, and sometimes from line shafts to driven machinery. Unlike leather belts, however, rope drives were sometimes used to transmit power over relatively long distances. Over long distances, intermediate sheaves were used to support the [...] "flying rope", and in the late 19th century, this was considered quite efficient.|$|R

50|$|Although {{starting}} cranks {{had been}} replaced by electric starters for decades, Ford cars included a manual starting feature until 1948 as an antidote to dead-battery syndrome. The wheel-lug wrench served as a handle (also for the jack) and the <b>jack</b> <b>shaft</b> with bayonet-coupling pins could be inserted through a small hole in the grille to engage a bayonet socket on the forward end of the engine crankshaft. A quick-and-easy twist of the handle was sufficient to start the flat head V8, and the bayonet coupling was self-disengaging for safety.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{just described}} is {{used only for}} the near row of jacks. In the far row, a simpler, mirror-image scheme is used: a single block of wood engages the jacks. It is just wide enough to raise both if the keyboard is in the intermediate position, but will engage only the front jack (longer string) if the keyboard is fully extracted, and only the <b>rear</b> <b>jack</b> (shorter string) if the keyboard is fully inserted.|$|R
5000|$|The CB900C is {{something}} of a [...] "parts bin" [...] bike, as it shares components with two contemporary Honda bikes, the CB750 and CB900F. The GL and CX series of touring motorcycles of the time are the source of the final drive and rear suspension assemblies of the CB900C. The frame was derived from the European CB900F, extended 2 inches to accommodate the sub-transmission components. The sub-transmission involves a <b>jack</b> <b>shaft</b> that allows the rider to select a [...] "high" [...] or [...] "low" [...] range for the five gears, effectively giving an overdrive 6th speed for cruising.|$|R

50|$|Then it was {{the usual}} sight of Mansell pulling away from Patrese and the two {{getting away from the}} rest. The Williamses pitted early unlike the McLarens. Mansell had a quick stop and rejoined in the lead but Patrese had a problem with his right <b>rear</b> <b>jack</b> and joined behind the McLarens. He passed Senna quickly and set off after Berger. On lap 35, the {{recovering}} Schumacher took sixth from Alboreto. Soon after, Patrese was right with Berger, looking for a way through.|$|R
50|$|This {{self-locking}} {{property is}} {{one reason for the}} very large use of the screw in threaded fasteners such as wood screws, sheet metal screws, studs and bolts. Tightening the fastener by turning it puts compression force on the materials or parts being fastened together, but no amount of force from the parts will cause the screw to untighten. This property is also the basis for the use of screws in screw top container lids, vises, C-clamps, and screw jacks. A heavy object can be raised by turning the <b>jack</b> <b>shaft,</b> but when the shaft is released it will stay at whatever height it is raised to.|$|R
50|$|Alonso put {{in several}} fast laps {{to extend his}} lead, and pitted on lap 41. The other drivers also pitted without incident, except Button, who stalled his BAR-Honda.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of a pipe jacking project of the Wu'ai Electric Power Tunnel, funded by Shenyang Power Company and constructed under the supervision of China Railway Construction Corporation in Shenyang, China. This project involves excavation of three <b>jacking</b> <b>shafts</b> and drilling tunnels by pipe jacking technique. A 3. 5 m diameter reinforced concrete pipe was jacked below the Hunhe River over a length of 1000 m. Hand shield approach was adopted on the river bank as an alternative of operating an earth pressure balance micro tunnel boring machine under the river. The stress-strain behavior of shafts under the maximum applied jacking forces was evaluated by means of finite element analyses. Monitoring data (i. e., tunnel alignment, jacking forces, resistance at the jacking head, frictional resistance and torque of the boring machine) were collected during the jacking process and are presented here. A tunnel face collapse was experienced; the corresponding countermeasure actions adopted are described. The jacking design (i. e., pipe, <b>jacking</b> machine, and <b>shafts)</b> and remediation for tunnel failure may provide reference for future projects and assist in the development of new design guidelines...|$|R

50|$|Herbert and Matchett both claimed their maiden Formula One wins in the 1995 British Grand Prix, a race perhaps made {{most famous}} {{for the fact that}} Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill crashed out of the race while battling for the lead. Although Matchett had by this time {{experienced}} many wins as part of the Benetton team, the win at Silverstone was significant as it was the first Benetton victory secured by a Matchett prepared car. Ten years later, in his closing remarks of the relevant episode of Formula 1 Decade Matchett described his feelings during the closing laps of that landmark race, and how much the win had meant to him. Said Matchett:Herbert and Matchett would team up for another Formula One win in at the 1995 Italian Grand Prix held at Monza, another race in which Schumacher and Hill crashed out together. His career as a mechanic was brought to an end by a back injury (from which he has since recovered) sustained while operating the <b>rear</b> <b>jack</b> on a car during a pre-race practice session.|$|R
2500|$|Lambert {{stopped the}} work {{at this stage of}} {{fabrication}} and shipped the non-working engine and incomplete automobile to a small machine shop that he owned in Ohio City. This way he could then devote his personal attention to the engine and automobile when he could from his businesses he was running there. The automobile consisted of two clutches and two chains, which were connected to a <b>jack</b> <b>shaft.</b> The two clutches gave two speeds forward and there was no reverse speed used. The single front wheel of the tricycle designed automobile was steered by a foot lever and a hand lever. This direct steering method provided that the arms could be rested and the steering done by the feet, and vice versa. One item that needed to be solved for completion and a working engine was a means of carburation. Lambert heard of a means of vaporizing gasoline by Gottlieb Daimler of Germany. He went to New York to see the engine that was operating a boat. After seeing this complicated carburetor Lambert developed what he called the [...] "vaporizer." [...] This was a simpler carburetor than Daimler's, which he was then able to get the engine working the way he intended it to. The automobile was completed soon after he had it Ohio City.|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Vehicle System Dynamics [© Taylor & Francis] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] data show that 35 % of fatal crashes in sport utility vehicles included vehicle rollover. At the same time, experimental testing to improve safety is expensive and dangerous. Therefore, multi-body simulation is used in this research to improve the understanding of rollover dynamics. The majority of previous work uses low-fidelity models. Here, a complex and highly nonlinear multi-body model with 165 degrees of freedom is correlated to vehicle kinematic and compliance (K&C) measurements. The Magic Formula tyre model is employed. Design of experiment methodology is used to identify tyre properties affecting vehicle rollover. A novel, statistical approach is used to link suspension K&C characteristics with rollover propensity. Research so far reveals that the tyre properties that have the greatest influence on vehicle rollover are friction coefficient, friction variation with load, camber stiffness and tyre vertical stiffness. Key K&C characteristics affecting rollover propensity are front and rear suspension rate, front roll stiffness, front camber gain, front and rear camber compliance and <b>rear</b> <b>jacking</b> force. © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
