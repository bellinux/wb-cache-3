40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} the <b>ratcheting</b> behavior of T 225 NG alloy, a series of <b>ratcheting</b> tests under uniaxial long-cyclic stressing were performed. The {{results show that the}} <b>ratcheting</b> strain of this alloy can get into shakedown after tens (or hundreds) of thousand cycles. After the <b>ratcheting</b> strain is saturated under the condition that stress amplitude is half of peak stress, it will bring about subsequent fatigue failure, and relationship between fatigue life and one of peak stress and saturated <b>ratcheting</b> (SR) strain meets power law. As the alloy is under stress jiggling with stress amplitude that is 1 %– 2. 5 % of peak stress, the <b>ratcheting</b> strain still become remarkable and goes into shakedown after several hundreds of thousand cycles but there exists little accessional strain caused by creep effect. It is notable that, when the peak stress is 85 %– 100 % of yield stress, the long cyclic stressing will lead SR strain to be from 1. 4 % to 2. 5 % even if the initial ratio of <b>ratcheting</b> strain is zero. Based on <b>ratcheting</b> threshold property of peak stress and monotonicity of relationship between the peak stress and SR strain, a saturated <b>ratcheting</b> model (SRM) is developed to predict SR strain and to estimate saturated creep strain also. In addition, the classes of <b>ratcheting</b> evolutions of metals are discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ratcheting</b> {{is known}} as {{accumulation}} of plastic strain during asymmetric cyclic loading of materials under non-zero mean stress. This study intends to investigate the <b>ratcheting</b> behavior in AISI 4340 steel which is mainly used for designing of railway wheel sets, axles, shafts, aircraft components etc. The effect of stress ratio on the <b>ratcheting</b> behavior in both annealed and normalised conditions, effect of previous low cycle fatigue deformation on <b>ratcheting</b> behavior and vice versa were investigated for investigated steel. <b>Ratcheting</b> tests were done at different stress ratios of - 0. 4, - 0. 6 and - 0. 8 and strain controlled low cycle fatigue tests were done at strain amplitudes of ± 0. 50 and ± 0. 75. The results showed that cyclic hardening takes place during <b>ratcheting</b> deformation while strain accumulation increases with increasing stress ratio. Prior fatigue deformation induces more <b>ratcheting</b> strain in the material under same magnitudes of stress ratios. Post <b>ratcheted</b> samples showed increase in tensile strength and hardness which increases with increasing stress ratio and these variations in tensile properties are correlated with the induced cyclic hardening. The X-ray diffraction profile analysis using the modified Williamson–Hall equation {{has been carried out}} in order to estimate the dislocation densities in the specimens subjected to both <b>ratcheting</b> and low cycle fatigue.

30|$|To some extent, strain {{accumulation}} (<b>ratcheting)</b> {{and wear}} are competitive mechanisms, with one reducing the influence {{the other has}} on the material. <b>Ratcheting</b> can cause subsurface hardening which can slow down the wear rate directly (higher hardness means greater wear resistance), and therefore <b>ratcheting</b> can reduce wear. Conversely, wear reduces the influence of <b>ratcheting</b> via material attrition. No matter which, if one process becomes dominant, then severe damage, such as severe wear and/or fatigue fractures, is the result. Therefore, the best relationship to maintain between rail and wheel is a balance of <b>ratcheting</b> and wear {{in order to achieve}} the state of steady wear [16], thereby facilitating maximum service life.|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of granular <b>ratcheting</b> as a long-time behavior in granular materials {{is still under}} discussion in the scientific and engineering community. This behavior refers to the constant accumulation of permanent deformation per cycle, when the granular sample is subjected to loading-unloading stress cycles with amplitudes well bellow the yield limit. <b>Ratcheting</b> regimes are observed in both numerical and physical experiments. There is no controversy about the {{existence of}} <b>ratcheting</b> when the stress amplitudes reach the yield criterion. However, {{it is not clear whether}} this effect persists for loading amplitudes well bellow the yield limit, or whether there is a certain regime where no accumulation of deformation occurs. Early numerical simulations suggested that <b>ratcheting</b> may persist for extremely small loading amplitudes (Alonso-Marroquin and H. J. Herrmann, Rev. Lett. 92 5 (2004) 054301). More recent investigations drive to the conclusion that <b>ratcheting</b> at low stress amplitudes may be strongly influenced by the selection of the contact force (McNamara et al. Phys. Rev. E 77 (3) (2008) 31304). Here we present a numerical investigation of the dependence of granular <b>ratcheting</b> on contact force in a packing of spheres using the Cundall-Strack model and the McNamara correction to the contact force.
