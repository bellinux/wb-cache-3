40|$|The {{current network}} {{architecture}} is based predominantly on stand-alone routers. It is becoming overtaxed {{with the introduction}} of integrated services. In this paper, we propose a Server and Agent based Active network Management (SAAM) architecture that scales well with integrated services. SAAM relieves individual routers from most routing and network management tasks. Instead, it employs a small number of dedicated servers to perform these tasks on behalf of the routers. In particular, these servers maintain a path information base (PIB), with which network functions, such as QoS routing and re-routing of real-time flows, can be efficiently implemented. We describe a scaleable architecture for organizing the servers as well as a concrete design of the PIB. SAAM has the potential of offering a common platform where multiple network functions — such as routing, resource <b>reservation,</b> <b>network</b> management, accounting and security — can be integrated. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Long range multi-hop {{wireless}} broadband services are {{an alternative to}} satellite {{for the provision of}} Internet connectivity. In a maritime network scenario, they can potentially offer solutions close to ports or relatively narrow water channels; over such a multi-hop network one could enable various services ranging from simple file transfers to real-time communication. Concentrating on the latter case, which poses the biggest challenges, we develop and evaluate strategies for dynamic and predictive network resource allocation in order to support Voice over IP. We analyse how the ability to monitor the mobility of seaborne vessels through the Automatic Identification System provides us with a critical advantage in anticipating topology changes. The algorithms developed maintain high resource uti-lization levels but also offer significant enhancements in Quality of Service by withholding resources for arriving vessels in order to satisfy their imminent data traffic demands.

For these reasons, the tourism industry in recent years has focused its activities towards the information and technological infrastructure and global electronic connection in order to overcome border barriers and establish relationships with providers and tourists as well as with travel agencies and tour-operators. The development of information technology and evolution of airline reservation systems of individual airlines have {{led to the development of}} the Global Distribution Systems (GDS), recognized as a worldwide computerized <b>reservation</b> <b>network</b> that electronically connects the tourist offer with the tourist demand. As a result of the recognized challenge tourism has been facing in recent years, the main goal of this review would be to emphasize the role and importance of the leading GDS Amadeus in order to highlight its po-tential for the tourism development at the global level. The research and methodology of this review are based on the analysis of data collected from primary and secondary sources, through which we shall, by using deductive approach to theoretical assumptions and analytical approach to quantitative indicators, reach significant individual findings. At the end of the review through summary conclusions, we shall attempt to give a scientific justification of the research, and draw attention to the importance of continuous monitoring and adjustment to changes in the tourism market, in order to highlight the main potential of information technology applications for tourism development.

40|$|Many {{scientific}} applications {{need support}} from a communication infrastructure that provides predictable performance, which requires effective algorithms for bandwidth <b>reservations.</b> <b>Network</b> <b>reservation</b> systems such as ESnet’s OSCARS, establish guaranteed bandwidth of secure virtual circuits for a certain bandwidth and length of time. However, users currently cannot inquire about bandwidth availability, nor have alternative suggestions when reservation requests fail. In general, the number of reservation options is exponential {{with the number of}} nodes n, and current reservation commitments. We present a novel approach for path finding in time-dependent networks taking advantage of user-provided parameters of total volume and time constraints, which produces options for earliest completion and shortest duration. The theoretical complexity is only O(n 2 r 2) in the worst-case, where r is the number of reservations in the desired time interval. We have implemented our algorithm and developed efficient methodologies for incorporation into <b>network</b> <b>reservation</b> frameworks.

40|$|Abstract—As {{businesses}} {{move their}} critical IT operations to multi-tenant cloud data centers, {{it is becoming}} increasingly important to provide network performance guarantees to in-dividual tenants. Due to the impact of network congestion on the performance of many common cloud applications, recent work has focused on enabling <b>network</b> <b>reservation</b> for individual tenants. Current <b>network</b> <b>reservation</b> methods, however, do not gracefully degrade in the presence of network oversubscriptions that may frequently occur in a cloud environment. In this context, for a shared data center network, we introduce Network Satisfaction Ratio (NSR) as a measure of the satisfaction derived by a tenant from a given <b>network</b> <b>reservation.</b> NSR is defined as the ratio of the actual reserved bandwidth to the de-sired bandwidth of the tenant. Based on NSR, we present a novel <b>network</b> <b>reservation</b> mechanism that can admit time-varying tenant requests and can fairly distribute any degradation in the NSR among the tenants in presence of network oversubscription. We evaluate the proposed method using both synthetic network traffic trace and representative data center traffic trace generated by running a reduced data center job trace in a small testbed. The evaluation shows that our method adapts to changes in <b>network</b> <b>reservations,</b> and it provides significant and fair improvement in NSR when the data center network is oversubscribed.

40|$|Abstract 1. The {{transmission}} of video over a high-speed network implies guaranteeing a Quality of Service (QoS). This transmission requires a very demanding <b>reservation</b> of <b>network</b> resources, so optimisation becomes a key issue. Traffic shaping {{has been proposed}} {{as a means for}} improving network utilisation. This paper introduces a fast and bounded method to obtain the leaky bucket shaper parameters that optimises <b>network</b> <b>reservations</b> (bandwidth and buffers) with deterministic guarantees using GPS scheduling. The algorithm presented finds the optimal solution in 5 or 6 iterations. Another important contribution of this paper is comparing this new admission scheme with different EDF control admission tests. Results show that although GPS is a little less efficient than the optimal EDF scheduler for one node (as expected), it is as efficient as the best RC-EDF known policies for several nodes, or even better when the number of network hops is high. ...|$|R
