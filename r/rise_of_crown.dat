[...] The book argues that the Framers, at their Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, sought to give America something closer to Congressional (or parliamentary) than presidential government, and that the former is a superior form of government. Buckley argues that America has now moved {{to a form of}} strong presidential government.|$|E
50|$|In 1217, Fernando III {{inherited}} the Kingdom of Castile from his mother, Doña Berenguela, and in 1230, the Kingdom of León from his father, Alfonso the IXth. In 1240, Fernando III peacefully re-conquered Cabra, where the inhabitants shared his customs and religion. Fernando III increased Cabra's area {{to include the}} majority of Andalusia which was {{under the control of}} his step-brother, Rodrigo Alfonso de León. The parliaments of León and Castile merged under the reign of Fernando III, marking the <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Castile. León, Toledo, Jaen, parts of Andalusia, and the conquered Arab dominions became the Kingdom of Castile.From the Order of Calatrava, the control of Cabra passed through a number of lords.|$|R
5000|$|Goat Mountain is a {{mountain}} peak <b>rising</b> east <b>of</b> the <b>Crown</b> Pass, located directly north of Grouse Mountain in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. An approximate 8km, 4 hour, round-trip hike from Grouse Mountain, Goat Mountain is popular with local hikers, as its steep summit tower provides excellent views over the Greater Vancouver area, Howe Sound, Washington State, the Strait of Georgia, Vancouver Island, and the Coast Mountains. It also offers area for bouldering east of its summit.|$|R
25|$|The kingdom {{strongly}} {{developed in}} the 14th and 15th century, {{which is to be}} considered as the Golden Age of the Valencian Culture, with first level works like Tirant lo Blanch. It also developed a high level role in Europe both economically with the silk trade, and politically with the <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon (in which the Kingdom of Valencia became the most populated and the main economical power at that time) and the ascension of the Valencian House of Borja in Rome. After a slow decline following the dynastic union <b>of</b> the <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon with the Kingdom of Castile, this came definitely to an end with the Expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609 by the Hispanic Monarchy, which represented the loss of up to one third {{of the population of the}} Kingdom of Valencia and took the main agricultural labor force away.In 1707, in the context of the War of the Spanish Succession, and by means of the Nova Planta decrees, king Philip V of Spain abolished the Kingdom of Valencia, and the rest of states belonging to the former <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon and which had retained some autonomy, and subordinated it to the structure of the Kingdom of Castile and its laws and customs. As a result of this, the institutions and laws created by the Furs of Valencia (Furs de València) were abolished and the usage of the Valencian language in official instances and education was forbidden. Consequently, with the House of Bourbon, a new Kingdom of Spain was formed implementing a more centralized government and absolutist regime than the former Habsburg Spain.|$|R
25|$|In 2005, New York {{introduced}} {{incentives to}} replace its current yellow cabs with electric hybrid vehicles {{such as the}} Toyota Prius and Ford Escape Hybrid. In May 2007, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed a five-year plan to switch New York City's taxicabs to more fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles {{as part of an}} agenda for New York City to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the plan was dropped after Cab companies complained that the cost of maintaining the new hybrid vehicles vastly outweighed the tiny amount of fuel savings they got from going smaller. Proponents of the traditional Lincoln Town Car and Ford Crown Victoria say they were well suited to their task, while others said customers who cared for the environment preferred hybrids. Not only that, but passenger safety also became an issue with the newer vehicles, and 6 months after the program took effect, it was dropped. Still, the proportion of the taxi fleet made up <b>of</b> <b>Crown</b> Victorias has dropped over time. In 2010, it stood at about 60% of yellow cabs, as the number of Ford Escape Hybrid and Toyota Sienna minivans kept <b>rising.</b> The percentage <b>of</b> <b>Crown</b> Victoria taxis in the city would be further undercut by the adoption of the similarly-sized Toyota Camry Hybrids since 2010, and the Toyota Prius V. By 2015, the Ford Victoria fleet would be nearly entirely replaced.|$|R
40|$|Reservoir dams on the Młynówka {{river in}} Górowo Iławeckie were largely {{destroyed}} after flood in February 2000. In 2011 the reconstruction and modernization of the dams was pursued {{in order to}} remove the damages caused by that catastrophic flood. Among others, the reinforced concrete spillway was constructed with a tower-type crest and a bottom sluice. In this paper, hydraulic calculations were performed and further analysed to estimate {{the effectiveness of the}} modernized spillway. Inventory works and basic field measurements were carried on in necessary scope for the analysis. Hydraulic conditions of flow in channel downstream of the dam were also examined. Discharge capacity of the sluice and the spillway was calculated and helped to estimate hydraulic conditions for flood flows. The maximum capacity of a single inlet to the drain at normal level of damming (NLD) is 4. 68 m 3 ·s- 1, what represents about 45 % of the design flow. Tower-type crest made on the ordinate NLD = 128. 60 m a. s. l., provides suitable transition of design flood (Qm) and control flood (Qk), maintaining a safe <b>rising</b> <b>of</b> crest <b>crown</b> for the buildings of safe grade four. The riverbed of Młynówka down the concrete spillway has been rebuilt at a distance of 830 m and six stone riffle, each with a height of 0. 30 m, has been build. As a result of the reservoir modernization, the flood protection has been improved in the adjacent areas...|$|R

This class of nobility was driven by their desire to reclaim family holdings and was generally compelled to use any means necessary. Despite the instability, Henry's forces were able to withstand Portuguese, Navarrese, and Granadian attempts to invade and take control of Castile.|$|R
50|$|The Northumbrian region {{continued}} {{a history}} of revolt and rebellion against the government, {{as seen in the}} <b>Rising</b> <b>of</b> the North in Tudor times. A major reason was the strength of Catholicism in the area after the Reformation. Rural, thinly populated, and sharing a border with an often hostile Scotland, the region became a wild place where reivers raided across the border and outlaws took refuge from justice. However, after the union <b>of</b> the <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> Scotland and England under King James VI and I, peace was largely established. After the Restoration, many inhabitants of the Northumbrian region supported the Jacobite cause.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{substituent}} on dibenzo- 16 -crown- 5 (DBz 16 C 5) and interaction between these crown ether with metal cations was evaluated using computational chemistry calculations. Substituens where {{are connected to}} the benzene ring on the DBz 16 C 5 are -COOH, -Br, -COOC 2 H 5, -CHO, -CH=CHCO 2 H, -CH=CHCO 2 C 2 H 5 and -CH(OH) CH 3. The analysis based on computational chemistry calculation using MNDO/d semi empirical method was done. The first step is structure optimization <b>of</b> <b>crown</b> ether followed by optimization <b>of</b> <b>crown</b> ether-metals cation complexes Mn+. [DBz 16 C 5], where M is Li+, Na+ and Zn 2 +. Interactions <b>of</b> the <b>crown</b> ether and cation were discussed in term of the structure parameter <b>of</b> <b>crown</b> ether, atomic charges and energy interaction <b>of</b> the <b>crown</b> ether-metals cation. Electron donating groups increase the capability <b>of</b> <b>crown</b> ether to bind cation by means of induction effect, while electron withdrawing groups reduce the ability <b>of</b> <b>crown</b> ether to bind cation. Any substituent on the benzene in DBz 16 C 5 which can be make the symmetrical form <b>of</b> the <b>crown</b> ether-metals cation complexes will increase the selectivity <b>of</b> the <b>crown</b> ether to bind the cation. Selectivity <b>of</b> the <b>crown</b> ether to bind cation also depends on the compatibility of the diameter of cation and cavity <b>of</b> <b>crown</b> ether.
