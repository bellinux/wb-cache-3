40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{viniculture}} sector in the Czech Republic in the stage of its adaptation to the united EU-market. The period before {{the entrance of the}} Czech Republic to the EU can be characterized by an effort to develop the necessary resources for its quantitative and qualitative growth at the maximum possible level. Evaluation of this period comes from analysis of: legislature and governmental and EU laws, directives and measures, development of the area of vineyards, human resources and businesses, wine market in the Czech Republic and the European Union, financial support of winegrowing and wine-production, structure of wine production, and price of grapes. Legislature for this sector had been changed in relation to the legislature of the EU – the main impacts being in registration of vineyards, the ban on new planting. Area of vineyards was enlarged by about 7 thousand hectares, and the main focus in the near future will be directed to their renewal – because of the age of the vineyards and bad heritage from the past in terms of low investments. The size structure of business subjects changed as well. Production potential is 19. 3 thousand hectares of vineyard, there is filed more than 18 thousand wine-growers and nearly 600 wine producers. There is a potential for 20 thousand jobs in this sector, and considering the limited production area of vineyards, this projects into a high influence on the character, and development level of these areas. Consumption of wine is gradually increasing (16. 5 litres per habitant per year, as yet). Prices, which were found, are relatively stable in the period of focus, with differences between white and blue varieties. Whereas the financial support of winegrowing was focused on enlarging the area of vineyards, in the pre-accession period, it is redirected to the <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> <b>vineyards,</b> integrated production of grapes, and reproduction of vines, in the current period. Wine imports constantly outweigh the exports in volume and value. Prices of grapes have been stable, in the past three years, but the price in 2005 was negatively influenced by wine imports. The analysis is summarized using the industry attractiveness evaluation matrix. It evaluates the selected influences with regard to the wine-production industry, which is evaluated as not very attractive, especially due to the low profitability of winegrowers, excessive regulation, and differences in financial support in different EU-member states...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{assessment}} of the development perspectives of the new grape varieties, resistant to fungal diseases, promoting therefore the reduction or the suppression of phytosanitary treatments. Based on a direct survey with researchers, stakeholders, a synthesis of the scientific literature and edited research programs, we propose an overview of {{the current state of the}} art of the supply of technology, and a presentation of the main stakeholders strategy involved in the innovation chain, a synthesis of the current scientific and technical controversies, and an analysis of the undertaking of the institutions and of the legislation. Further, we provide an evaluation of the previous research program on new grape varieties of the French National Institute for Research in Agronomy (INRA) and the results of the diffusion achieved in Languedoc-Roussillon. This analysis will allow us to discuss the conditions for the success of this innovation as a competitiveness factor. Obtaining a new grape variety is a long term process that can last up to 20 or 30 years. According to the evolutionary approach (Nelson and Winter, 1982), it is the technological paradigm of the research programs intending to improve the proprieties of the plant that defines the technological trajectory. In relation with this delay for the obtaining new grape varieties, the success of the diffusion of the new varieties faces three main difficulties: (1) Professionals need to agree on the relevance of the paradigm, In other words on the characteristics of the research program; (2) A gap appears between the characteristics of new varieties proposed for diffusion and the new perception of the needs of those professionals or their market, broadly different 25 years later, and (3) the rhythm of the diffusion of these innovations, approximately 2. 5 %/year, related to the life-cycle of the vine plant. In France, the awareness of obtaining grape varieties resistant to diseases emerged quite late, except in the case of the work of one research director from INRA, starting the improvement of the varieties in that direction in the 1980 s. His work was merely recently resumed. Since World War II, those working in Europe on the new grape varieties have been mainly public researchers. However, the contractual relationships with stakeholders in charge of spreading those varieties – the nurseries -vary considerably according to the countries, the size and the strategy of the grape nurseries. The issues related to licenses and royalties are an essential matter. The industry is therefore characterized by the presence of various resistant grape varieties created in several countries in Europe by researchers or grape nurseries. In each country where the new varieties were created, new varieties were registered in every national catalogue, but registration of those foreign varieties were not, until today, extended to the French national catalogue. Therefore, it excludes those varieties from potential CAP subsidies. Some innovative grape growers anticipated the social demand and adopted those resistant varieties without the support of public subsidies. In addition, those grape growers processed the grapes and established a label to highlight this environmental advantage. A scientific controversy adds to the environmental and social issues, which deals with the ‘stability of the resistance’ over time. In short, the first varieties obtained featured a ‘monogenic’ resistance, considered by some researchers as easily circumvented. These researchers block or try to slow down the availability of new resistant varieties, waiting for the registration at the French national catalogue of a ‘new wave’ of grape varieties whose resistance would be ‘polygenic’. This scientific controversy creates uncertainty for public officers and a standby position criticized by those wishing a faster diffusion of those innovations in the wine chain. Further, the wine production in Europe is traditionally characterized by quality designations of origin - PGI and PDO – which base their reputation on the main traditional grape varieties and therefore exclude new grape varieties. In France, those quality designations account for approximately 85 percent of the wine production and create most of the value in the wine chain. This exclusion inhibits significant extension. Finally, the issues allowing the rapid diffusion of resistant grape varieties excluding pesticides might include: fostering the rate of renewing vineyards, the register of new European grape varieties in the French national catalogue, the full or partial acceptation of the new grape varieties in PDO areas, the increase of the political pressure from ecologists and the civil society about the reduction of phytosanitary inputs, the integration of those varieties in the national endowment of the wine CMO for the <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> <b>vineyards</b> or, finally, the insertion of resistance genes in traditional varieties through faster means than classic genetics. However, the strategy consisting in the creation of new varieties through GMO methods seems not adapted to the Society, including at the research level...|$|E

This was initially developed at IMAIAA - the Institute for Agricultural Markets and Agro Food Industries - in performing tasks related to the program PAMAF. There followed a brief passage by a private consulting firm with work related to the preparation of applications for obtaining support from the European Union (EU). Finally, my integration into IFADAP - Institute of Finance and Development Support of Agriculture and Fisheries - that with the recast of the Ministry of Agriculture has been integrated with INGA - the National Guarantee Fund, passing its name to IFAP - Institute of Finance for Agriculture and Fisheries, in which I exercised functions of analysis of applications submitted under the Operational Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) and tasks developed to operationalize the Scheme <b>of</b> <b>Restructuring</b> and Conversion <b>of</b> <b>Vineyard</b> (VITIS and RARRV).

Comment: This type of EU support aims to assist the EU industry to restructure in response to changing market demands, thereby maintaining the EU's competitiveness vis-à-vis new third-country suppliers. The EU sees such aid as non-trade-distorting, but since it covers costs of modernisation which wine producers in developing countries have to cover themselves, it inevitably impacts favourably on the competitiveness of EU wine production.

40|$|Emblematic space, the Demarcated Douro Region (DDR) is {{not only}} the privileged space where are producedwines of high quality, with {{prominently}} evidence to Port Wine, but also a landscape with a superb heritage thatreflects a long history. In fact, along its 250 000 hectares, terraces are full <b>of</b> <b>vineyards</b> that climb through thehillsides of the Douro River and main tributaries, providing a distinctive landscape, classified by UNESCO inDecember 2001 as "Living Cultural Evolutionary Landscape, World Heritage of Humanity". Despite its privileged environment, the region is involved in multiple issues of which stands out the deficientstructure of agricultural properties and an aging and receding human structure. In order to mitigate these problems, investment in <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vineyards</b> and in the training of the landowners and employees, but, above all, in Rural Tourism (RT), in its various aspects, had been made. In this context, farms associated with Oenotourism and Habitation Tourism are multiplying, in addition to projects that have invested not only in quality and distinction, but also in a privileged landscape and local gastronomy/oenology. In this communication, based on extensive fieldwork in documentary research and analysis combined with theapplication of structured interviews, we focus on the impact of RT in the Douro Demarcated Region (DDR),especially of oenotourism. In this context, after a general survey of the units in the DDR using various documentary sources, we selected aparadigmatic case to acess its impact. The repercussions of this strategic bet of the region are unquestionable,since this way a valuable heritage is recovered, while the vineyards are restructured and a patrimonializedlandscape is preserved in a tendentially sustainable context...|$|R
