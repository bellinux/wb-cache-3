40|$|Abstract: In general, the {{strength}} of gears is calculated using the formula of AGMA or JGMA. But these formula can not be applied directly to {{the strength}} calculation of the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> pinion of steering gear assay, because of complex tooth and contact shapes. So Lewis bending stress and Hertzian contact stress formula are generally used {{for the design of}} <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> pinion of steering gear assay. But these formula do not also give the exact stress of <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> pinion. In this paper, comparing the finite element analysis results and the experimentally measured values, it is shown that the finite element modeling technique of the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> pinion of steering assay is reasonable.

40|$|The {{methodology}} {{to optimize}} the utilization of Spacelab <b>racks</b> <b>and</b> pallets and to apply this methodology to the early STS Spacelab missions was developed. A review was made of Spacelab Program requirements and flow plans, generic flow plans for <b>racks</b> <b>and</b> pallets were examined, and the principal optimization criteria and methodology were established. Interactions between schedule, inventory, and key optimization factors; schedule and cost sensitivity to optional approaches; {{and the development of}} tradeoff methodology were addressed. This methodology was then applied to early spacelab missions (1980 - 1982). <b>Rack</b> <b>and</b> pallet requirements and duty cycles were defined, a utilization assessment was made, and several trade studies performed involving varying degrees of Level IV integration, inventory level, and shared versus dedicated Spacelab <b>racks</b> <b>and</b> pallets...|$|R

Notions of free <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> quandle modules are introduced, {{and used to}} define an enveloping object (the `rack algebra' or `wring') for a given rack or quandle.
