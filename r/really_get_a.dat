One of the reviewers for Famitsu magazine said that {{the large number of}} characters made the game [...] "a very different [...]" [...] RPG Site's Erren Van Duine was very impressed, saying that certain character interactions were [...] "handled excellently and you <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> sense of specific character motivations because of it." [...] He also praised the sympathetic portrayal of Cid Aulstyne, and stated that the game had [...] "so many great moments, [...] have to experience each little detail for [...] Heath Hindman, writing for PlayStation Lifestyle, called the characters [...] "pretty strong overall", although she cited some scenes where various characters' inclusion felt like a necessity rather than a useful element to be a fault.|$|E
500|$|Chris Schulz of The New Zealand Herald {{said that}} the song, {{alongside}} the album tracks [...] "Paddling Out" [...] and [...] "Bavarian #1 (Say You Will)", [...] "will swirl around in your head for days and demand repeat plays". Spin Josh Modell named it a highlight of the album; he wrote that if the album as a whole sounded like [...] "The Wave", [...] "it could fill arenas". Chris Martins of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "Though Wyatt's vocals recall a sad-faced Peter Gabriel, the song is steeped {{in the kind of}} effervescent magic that makes Lykke Li and Peter Bjorn and John stars in their own right." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters was critical of Wyatt's vocal performance; he wrote that [...] "we <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> sense of how Wyatt's voice hinders the group". He {{said that the}} singer intones the lyrics [...] "somewhat abstractly, but with absolutely no sense of gravity to be found in his voice at all".|$|E
500|$|The {{play has}} {{received}} modest reviews. Julian Hall of The Independent criticized {{it for a}} lack of inside stories about The Simpsons, writing that [...] "Cartwright never allows you to become bored but that means some issues are skirted over faster than American closing credits on television. You never <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> feel what it is like recording the show." [...] Brian Logan of The Guardian described Cartwright as [...] "a lively host [...] eager to please", but found the play to be [...] "an overweeningly upbeat collection of Simpsons chitchat." [...] David Chatterton of British Theatre Guide described it as [...] "interesting and entertaining, but not really a 'must see' even for Simpsons fans." [...] Clive Davis of The Times wrote that [...] "In contrast to The Simpsons itself, where not a line, not a syllable, goes to waste, Cartwright has a habit of losing herself in anecdotes that stumble into dead-ends. [...] The half-hearted trivia quiz involving volunteers from the audience soon dies a death too. The performance really cries out for a hard-headed director. The video clips of Cartwright at large are fun, however." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{opinions}} of Jasmine have been generally mixed; some critics appreciated the character for continuing to [...] "break the mold" [...] {{that had been}} established by Disney's earliest princesses. Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly described Jasmine as Disney's [...] "most full-bodied" [...] heroine, while Desson Howe of The Washington Post commended the character for providing the film with [...] "feminist consciousness". The Christian Science Monitors David Sterrit wrote that Jasmine [...] "is less carefully worked out [...] but equally likable as a personality type." [...] Contactmusic.com agreed that the character exhibits [...] "likeably cynical streaks" [...] despite being an [...] "essentially bland" [...] character. Gary Thompson of the Philadelphia Daily News wrote, [...] "Princess Jasmine is also more barbed, yet without the obvious feminist makeover given to Belle". Similarly, James Berardinelli of ReelViews commended Jasmine for [...] "show the same streak of stubborn independence exhibited by Ariel and Belle," [...] but ultimately criticized the fact that [...] "she doesn't fill a more pressing role than that of Aladdin's 'love interest.'" [...] Agreeing that Jasmine appears [...] "bland" [...] in comparison to Aladdins supporting characters, Mari Ness of Tor.com wrote, [...] "Jasmine follows {{in the footsteps of}} Ariel and Belle as someone unhappy with the restrictions of her world and her lack of choices: like both of them, she takes active steps to change this, and it's not entirely her fault that she's a secondary character in a film not all that interested in her... She's perceptive, and fast thinking, but this isn't her movie, and in the end, although she does get to choose her own husband, she doesn't <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance, like Ariel and Belle, to move out of her world. She can be shown the world, but she stays in her palace." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nancy Taylor, the {{headmistress}} of the school, said in 2010 {{that the}} school aimed to instill the value of helping others in its students. The school uses several extracurricular projects, such as a [...] "Big Brother, Little Brother" [...] program and a [...] "Social Justice" [...] program. Jennifer Glover, the school's director of admission, said in 2008 that [...] "The social justice program is essentially a program being built around rule number three, social awareness which impels to action. Essentially what the school {{is trying to do}} is to take that issue the communities confront and educate the boys on those issues and also built some initiative or activity around that particular issue so that the boys can <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> feel of how it is impacting the community." [...] In 2008 Sacred Heart established a donation program for the Houston Food Bank. The school also participates in the Operation Rice Bowl campaign, where boys only eat a bowl of white rice for one day during Ash Wednesday.|$|E
2500|$|Creator Elizabeth Meriwether sees Nick, Schmidt and Winston [...] "on the weirder side of things". The {{producers}} stated {{learning more}} about the characters by seeing the actors' work and that [...] "We probably rely on them more than we should" [...] to define the characters. For example, the producers found more variety in Nick's character in season 1 and enjoyed Johnson's improvisations, so they relayed Coach's attributed rage issues to Nick. Nick is a childhood friend of Winston, has been best friends with Schmidt since his college days and becomes close to Jess, so his character connects the most with the other loftmates and is often part of their stories. Jake Johnson (Nick) noted the contrast to the original plans for his character, as season 1 turned Nick into [...] "an idiot, he's not keeping anyone together", and that he did not fully understand his character in season 1, partly because the character might not have figured himself out at the age of 30. Johnson felt that initially it seemed like Nick hated Schmidt for being a douchebag, but the show later teamed them up like The Odd Couple, showing their genuine friendship and simultaneous idiocy as they get into trouble. According to Johnson, he and Max Greenfield (Schmidt) [...] "couldn't be more different [...] and it's very much like Nick and Schmidt, but we both <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> kick out of the other guy" [...] on set.|$|E

60|$|The other event which altered Mike's life in {{the bank}} was his removal from Mr Waller's {{department}} to the Fixed Deposits. The work in the Fixed Deposits was less pleasant, and Mr Gregory, {{the head of the}} department was not of Mr Waller's type. Mr Gregory, before joining the home-staff of the New Asiatic Bank, had spent a number of years with a firm in the Far East, where he had acquired a liver and a habit of addressing those under him in a way that suggested the mate of a tramp steamer. Even on the days when his liver was not troubling him, he was truculent. And when, as usually happened, it did trouble him, he was a perfect fountain of abuse. Mike and he hated each other from the first. The work in the Fixed Deposits was not really difficult, when you got the hang of it, but there was a certain amount of confusion in it to a beginner; and Mike, in commercial matters, was as raw a beginner as ever began. In the two other departments through which he had passed, he had done tolerably well. As regarded his work in the Postage Department, stamping letters and taking them down to the post office was just about his form. It was the sort of work on which he could <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> grip. And in the Cash Department, Mr Waller's mild patience had helped him through. But with Mr Gregory it was different. Mike hated being shouted at. It confused him. And Mr Gregory invariably shouted. He always spoke as if he were competing against a high wind. With Mike he shouted more than usual. On his side, it must be admitted that Mike was something out of the common run of bank clerks. The whole system of banking was a horrid mystery to him. He did not understand why things were done, or how the various departments depended on and dove-tailed into one another. Each department seemed to him something separate and distinct. Why they were all in the same building at all he never really gathered. He knew that it could not be purely from motives of sociability, in order that the clerks might have each other's company during slack spells. That much he suspected, but beyond that he was vague.|$|E
60|$|But {{all this}} {{commercial}} copying is very superficial; and above all, it never copies {{anything that is}} really worth copying. Nations never learn anything {{from each other in}} this way. We have many things to learn from America; but we only listen to those Americans who have still to learn them. Thus, for instance, we do not import the small farm but only the big shop. In other words, we hear nothing of the democracy of the Middle West, but everything of the plutocracy of the middleman, who is probably as unpopular in the Middle West as the miller in the Middle Ages. If Mr. Elihu K. Pike could be transplanted bodily from the neighbourhood of his home town of Marathon, Neb., with his farm and his frame-house and all its fittings, and they could be set down exactly in the spot now occupied by Selfridge's (which could be easily cleared away for the purpose), I think we could <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> great deal of good by watching him, even if the watching were inevitably a little too like watching a wild beast in a cage or an insect under a glass case. Urban crowds could collect every day behind a barrier or railing, and gaze at Mr. Pike pottering about all day in his ancient and autochthonous occupations. We could see him growing Indian corn with all the gravity of an Indian; though it is impossible to imagine Mrs. Pike blessing the cornfield in the manner of Minnehaha. As I have said, there is a certain lack of humane myth and mysticism about this Puritan peasantry. But we could see him transforming the maize into pop-corn, which is a very pleasant domestic ritual and pastime, and is the American equivalent of the glory of roasting chestnuts. Above all, many of us would learn {{for the first time that}} a man can really live and walk about upon something more productive than a pavement; and that when he does so he can really be a free man, and have no lord but the law. Instead of that, America can give nothing to London but those multiple modern shops, of which it has too many already. I know that many people entertain the innocent illusion that big shops are more efficient than small ones; but that is only because the big combinations have the monopoly of advertisement as well as trade. The big shop is not in the least remarkable for efficiency; it is only too big to be blamed for its inefficiency. It is secure in its reputation for always sacking the wrong man. A big shop, considered as a place to shop in, is simply a village of small shops roofed in to keep out the light and air; and one in which none of the shopkeepers is really responsible for his shop. If any one has any doubts on this matter, since I have mentioned it, let him consider this fact: that in practice we never do apply this method of commercial combination to anything that matters very much. We do not go to the surgical department of the Stores to have a portion of our brain removed by a delicate operation; and then pass on to the advocacy department to employ one or any of its barristers, when we are in temporary danger of being hanged. We go to men who own their own tools and are responsible for the use of their own talents. And the same truth applies to that other modern method of advertisement, which has also so largely fallen across us like the gigantic shadow of America. Nations do not arm themselves for a mortal struggle by remembering which sort of submarine they have seen most often on the hoardings. They can do it about something like soap, precisely because a nation will not perish by having a second-rate sort of soap, as it might by having a second-rate sort of submarine. A nation may indeed perish slowly by having a second-rate sort of food or drink or medicine; but that is another and much longer story, and the story is not ended yet. But nobody wins a great battle at a great crisis because somebody has told him that Cadgerboy's Cavalry Is the Best. It may be that commercial enterprise will eventually cover these fields also, and advertisement-agents will provide the instruments of the surgeon and the weapons of the soldier. When that happens, the armies will be defeated and the patients will die. But though we modern people are indeed patients, in the sense of being merely receptive and accepting things with astonishing patience, we are not dead yet; and we have lingering gleams of sanity.|$|E
