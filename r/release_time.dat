5|$|Journalists {{noted that}} many of the user reviews for Portal 2 on Metacritic evoked {{negative}} opinion of the game, believed to be tied to the minimal impact on Portal 2s <b>release</b> <b>time.</b> These users cited complaints about the game being too short (with some saying it is only four hours long), the existence of paid downloadable content at launch for some versions, and supposed evidence that the game on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X were ports of the console version. Journalists have defended Valve in these claims, countering that the game's length depends on the amount of immersion the player puts into the game, that the downloadable content is only cosmetic additions for the co-op mode, and that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac version do not suggest a simple console port.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Objectives of the Study: On June 30, 1977, Oregon {{passed a}} law authorizing five hours per week of <b>released</b> <b>time</b> for {{religious}} instruction {{on the high school}} level. The {{purpose of this study was}} to seek answers to five general questions: (1) What was the level of awareness of released-time programs? (2) What level of interest existed for the establishment of extended programs of <b>released</b> <b>time</b> for religious instruction? (3) What might be the impact of extended <b>released</b> <b>time</b> on the public high school? (4) What might be the impact of establishing extended released- time programs on churches? (5) What impact might released-time programs have on church-school interaction? Research Procedures: Three groups selected from Polk and Marion counties were administered a questionnaire which was developed for this research. The three groups were: citizens, public high school teachers, and church leaders. Of the 1, 978 questionnaires distributed, 830 useable returns were received. This was a response rate of 43. 4 percent. Because of this low response rate, generalizations beyond the actual respondents should be made with extreme care. The one-way analysis of variance statistic (F test) was used to determine significant differences among the responses of the three groups to the questionnaire. * The Least Significant Difference (LSD) statistic was used to identify where these differences occurred. An analysis of variance according to selected demographic data was also conducted. The demographic areas were: sex, age, marital status, annual income, highest education level completed, personal enrollment in <b>released</b> <b>time</b> programs, enrollment of children in <b>released</b> <b>time</b> programs, religious preference, and extent of church activity. For teachers, an analysis was conducted based on size of faculty at the high school where they were teaching. Conclusions: All five of the null hypotheses were rejected at the. 05 level of significance. There were significant differences among the three groups for each of the five areas of this study. Specifically this study found: 1. Teachers are less in favor of <b>released</b> <b>time</b> than are citizens or church leaders. 2. Church leaders are more in favor of <b>released</b> <b>time</b> than are teachers or citizens. 3. There was a general lack of awareness of <b>released</b> <b>time</b> programs. 4. There was considerable interest expressed toward the implementation of <b>released</b> <b>time</b> programs. 5. Males were more favorable toward <b>released</b> <b>time</b> programs than were females. 6. Those with children currently enrolled in <b>released</b> <b>time</b> programs were more favorable toward these programs than those who did not have children currently enrolled in <b>released</b> <b>time</b> programs. 7. Latter-Day Saints were more favorable toward <b>released</b> <b>time</b> programs than were other religious groups. 8. Respondents who were very active in their churches were more favorable toward <b>released</b> <b>time</b> programs than were those who were moderately active, slightly active, or inactive. 9.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{a fundamental}} {{problem in the}} theory of real-time scheduling, that of scheduling a set of periodic or sporadic tasks on a uniprocessor without preemption and without inserted idle time. We exhibit a necessary and sufficient set of conditions C for a set of periodic or sporadic tasks to be schedulable for arbitrary <b>release</b> <b>times</b> of the tasks. We then show that any set of periodic or sporadic tasks that satisfies conditions C can be scheduled with an earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling algorithm. We also address the question of schedulability of a set of tasks with specified <b>release</b> <b>times.</b> For sets of sporadic tasks with specified <b>release</b> <b>times,</b> we show that the conditions C are again necessary and sufficient for schedulability. However, for sets of periodic tasks with specified <b>release</b> <b>times,</b> the conditions C, while sufficient, are not necessary. In fact, we show that determining whether a set of periodic tasks with specified <b>release</b> <b>times</b> is schedulable is intractable (i. e., NP-hard in the strong sense). Moreover, we show that the existence of a universal algorithm for scheduling periodic tasks with specified <b>release</b> <b>times</b> would imply that P = NP. 1...|$|R

[...] Thriller was placed at number 1 on the list, where it was referred to as his [...] "master work" [...] and that [...] "commercial success has since overshadowed Jackson's artistic accomplishments on Thriller, and that's a pity.
