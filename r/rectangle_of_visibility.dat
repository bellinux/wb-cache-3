40|$|Abstract. We {{adapt the}} {{distribution}} sweepingmethod to the cache oblivious model. Distribution sweepingis the name {{used for a}} general approach for divide-and-conquer algorithms where the combination of solved subproblems {{can be viewed as}} a merging process of streams. We demonstrate by a series of algorithms for specific problems the feasibility of the method in a cache oblivious setting. The problems all come from computational geometry, and are: orthogonal line segment intersection reporting, the all nearest neighbors problem, the 3 D maxima problem, computingthe measure of a set <b>of</b> axis-parallel <b>rectangles,</b> computingthe <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> a set of line segments from a point, batched orthogonal range queries, and reportingpairwise intersections <b>of</b> axis-parallel <b>rectangles.</b> Our basic buildingblock is a simplified version of the cache oblivious sorting algorithm Funnelsort of Frigo et al., which is of independent interest. ...|$|R
50|$|Other {{variations}} of basketweave change the stitch patterns that compose the <b>rectangles.</b> Instead <b>of</b> stockinette stitch and its reverse, the rectangles {{can be done}} in seed stitch, in cables or lace. An especially common variant is to alternate <b>rectangles</b> <b>of</b> ribbing with <b>rectangles</b> <b>of</b> welting, e.g., <b>rectangles</b> <b>of</b> three ribs set against <b>rectangles</b> <b>of</b> three welts.|$|R

40|$|A {{proximity}} {{drawing of}} a graph is a straight-line drawing where adjacent vertices are represented by points that are deemed to be close according to some proximity measure. A <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> influence drawing is a proximity drawing where the measure {{is based on the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> influence. Given two points u and v, the <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> influence of u and v is the axis-aligned rectangle having u and v at opposite corners. The <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> influence {{drawing of a}} graph G is a proximity drawing of G such that (i) for each pair of adjacent vertices u; v <b>of</b> G, the <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> influence of the points representing u and v is empty (i. e. contains no point representing a vertex distinct from u and v), and (ii) for each pair of non-adjacent vertices u; v <b>of</b> G, the <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> influence of the points representing u and v is not empty. Two different representation models are possible depending on whether the <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> influence is an open or a closed set. In this paper we study [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Given {{two points}} x and y {{in the plane}} the <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> {{influence}} of x and y is the axis-aligned rectangle having x and y at opposite corners. The <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> influence drawing of a graph G is a Straight-line drawing of G such that (i) for each pair of adjacent vertices u, v <b>of</b> G the <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> influence of the points representing u and v is empty (i. e. does not contain any other point representing any other vertex of G except possibly the two representing u and v) and (ii) for each pair of non adjacent vertices u, v <b>of</b> G the <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> influence of the points representing u and v is not empty. In this paper we consider several classes of graphs, and we characterize, for each class, which graphs of the class have a <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> influence drawing. For each class we show {{that the problem of}} testing whether a graph G has a <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> influence drawing can be done in linear time. Furthermore, if the test for G is affirmative, a <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> influence drawing of G can be constructed in linear time with the real RAM model of computation...|$|R
