40|$|Plasmonic <b>resonant</b> <b>cavities</b> {{are capable}} of {{confining}} light at the nanoscale, resulting in both enhanced local electromagnetic fields and lower mode volumes. However, conventional plasmonic <b>resonant</b> <b>cavities</b> possess large Ohmic losses at metal-dielectric interfaces. Plasmonic near-field coupling {{plays a key role}} in a design of photonic components based on the <b>resonant</b> <b>cavities</b> because of the possibility to reduce losses. Here, we study the plasmonic near-field coupling in the silver nanorod metamaterials treated as <b>resonant</b> nanostructured optical <b>cavities.</b> Reflectance measurements reveal the existence of multiple resonance modes of the nanorod metamaterials, which is consistent with our theoretical analysis. Furthermore, our numerical simulations show that the electric field at the longitudinal resonances forms standing waves in the nanocavities due to the near-field coupling between the adjacent nanorods, and a new hybrid mode emerges due to a coupling between nanorods and a gold-film substrate. We demonstrate that this coupling can be controlled by changing the gap between the silver nanorod array and gold substrate...|$|R
25|$|By {{combining}} the magnetron concept with resonator loops created by drilling holes in solid copper, an idea from W. W. Hansen's work on klystrons, the two constructed a model {{version of what}} they called the <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity</b> magnetron. They placed it inside a glass enclosure evacuated with an external vacuum pump, and placed the entire assembly between the poles of a powerful horseshoe magnet, which caused the electrons to bend around into a circular path.|$|E
25|$|The real Earth–ionosphere {{waveguide}} is not {{a perfect}} electromagnetic <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity.</b> Losses due to finite ionosphere electrical conductivity lower the propagation speed of electromagnetic signals in the cavity, resulting in a resonance frequency that is lower than would be expected in an ideal case, and the observed peaks are wide. In addition, {{there are a number}} of horizontal asymmetries – day-night difference in the height of the ionosphere, latitudinal changes in the Earth's magnetic field, sudden ionospheric disturbances, polar cap absorption, variation in the Earth radius of ± 11km from equator to geographic poles, etc. that produce other effects in the Schumann resonance power spectra.|$|E
25|$|This global {{electromagnetic}} resonance {{phenomenon is}} named after physicist Winfried Otto Schumann who predicted it mathematically in 1952. Schumann resonances occur because {{the space between the}} surface of the Earth and the conductive ionosphere acts as a closed waveguide. The limited dimensions of the Earth cause this waveguide to act as a <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity</b> for electromagnetic waves in the ELF band. The cavity is naturally excited by electric currents in lightning. Schumann resonances are the principal background in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3Hz through 60Hz, and appear as distinct peaks at extremely low frequencies (ELF) around 7.83Hz (fundamental), 14.3, 20.8, 27.3 and 33.8Hz.|$|E

Furthermore, if the experiments become directional, employing suitable <b>resonant</b> <b>cavities,</b> one expects large asymmetries in the observed widths relative to the sun's direction of motion. Due to the rotation of the Earth around its axis, these asymmetries will manifest themselves as a diurnal variation in the observed width...|$|R

5000|$|Microwave {{measurement}} techniques based on cavity perturbation theory are generally {{used to determine}} the dielectric and magnetic parameters of materials and various circuit components such as dielectric resonators. Since ex-ante knowledge of the resonant frequency, resonant frequency shift and electromagnetic fields is necessary in order to extrapolate material properties, these {{measurement techniques}} generally make use of standard <b>resonant</b> <b>cavities</b> where <b>resonant</b> frequencies and electromagnetic fields are well known. Two examples of such standard <b>resonant</b> <b>cavities</b> are rectangular and circular waveguide cavities and coaxial cables resonators [...] Cavity perturbation measurement techniques for material characterization are used in many fields ranging from physics and material science to medicine and biology.|$|R
25|$|A flute {{produces}} {{sound when}} {{a stream of}} air directed across {{a hole in the}} instrument creates a vibration of air at the hole. The airstream creates a Bernoulli or siphon. This excites the air contained in the usually cylindrical <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity</b> within the flute. The flutist changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes {{in the body of the}} instrument, thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency. By varying the air pressure, a flutist can also change the pitch by causing the air in the flute to resonate at a harmonic rather than the fundamental frequency without opening or closing any holes.|$|E
25|$|Given their vertical-cavity geometry, VCSOAs are <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity</b> optical {{amplifiers}} {{that operate}} with the input/output signal entering/exiting normal to the wafer surface. In {{addition to their}} small size, the surface normal operation of VCSOAs leads {{to a number of}} advantages, including low power consumption, low noise figure, polarization insensitive gain, and the ability to fabricate high fill factor two-dimensional arrays on a single semiconductor chip. These devices are still {{in the early stages of}} research, though promising preamplifier results have been demonstrated. Further extensions to VCSOA technology are the demonstration of wavelength tunable devices. These MEMS-tunable vertical-cavity SOAs utilize a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based tuning mechanism for wide and continuous tuning of the peak gain wavelength of the amplifier. SOAs have a more rapid gain response, which is in the order of 1 to 100 ps.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{addition}} to the SOA family is the vertical-cavity SOA (VCSOA). These devices are similar in structure to, and share many features with, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). The major difference when comparing VCSOAs and VCSELs is the reduced mirror reflectivity used in the amplifier cavity. With VCSOAs, reduced feedback is necessary to prevent the device from reaching lasing threshold. Due to the extremely short cavity length, and correspondingly thin gain medium, these devices exhibit very low single-pass gain (typically {{on the order of}} a few percent) and also a very large free spectral range (FSR). The small single-pass gain requires relatively high mirror reflectivity to boost the total signal gain. In {{addition to}} boosting the total signal gain, the use of the <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity</b> structure results in a very narrow gain bandwidth; coupled with the large FSR of the optical cavity, this effectively limits operation of the VCSOA to single-channel amplification. Thus, VCSOAs can be seen as amplifying filters.|$|E

40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{properties of}} a hybrid composite that exhibits both photonic and phononic behavior are investigated numerically with finite-element and finite-difference time-domain simulations. The structure is constituted of a periodic array of photonic <b>resonant</b> <b>cavities</b> {{embedded in a}} background superlattice. The <b>resonant</b> <b>cavities</b> contain a photo-elastic chalcogenide glass that undergoes atomic-scale structural reorganization when irradiated with light having energy close to its band-gap. Photo-excitation of the chalcogenide glass changes its elastic properties and, consequently, augments the acoustic transmission spectrum of the composite. By modulating the intensity of light irradiating the hybrid photonic/phononic structure, the position and spectral width of phonon passing-bands can be controlled. This demonstration offers the technological platform for optically-tunable acoustic wave band-pass filters...|$|R
25|$|All cavity {{magnetrons}} {{consist of}} a heated cathode placed at a high (continuous or pulsed) negative potential created by a high-voltage, direct-current power supply. The cathode {{is placed in the}} center of an evacuated, lobed, circular chamber. A magnetic field parallel to the filament is imposed by a permanent magnet. The magnetic field causes the electrons, attracted to the (relatively) positive outer part of the chamber, to spiral outward in a circular path, a consequence of the Lorentz force. Spaced around the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities. Slots are cut {{along the length of the}} cavities that open into the central, common cavity space. As electrons sweep past these slots, they induce a high-frequency radio field in each <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity,</b> which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups. (This principle of cavity resonator is very similar to blowing a stream of air across the open top of a glass pop bottle.) A portion of the radio frequency energy is extracted by a short antenna that is connected to a waveguide (a metal tube, usually of rectangular cross section). The waveguide directs the extracted RF energy to the load, which may be a cooking chamber in a microwave oven or a high-gain antenna in the case of radar.|$|E
500|$|A {{dual-mode}} filter {{is a kind}} of <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity</b> filter, but in {{this case}} each cavity is used to provide two resonators by employing two modes (two polarizations), so halving the volume of the filter for a given order. [...] This improvement in size of the filter is a major advantage in aircraft avionics and space applications. [...] High quality filters in these applications can require many cavities which occupy significant space.|$|E
500|$|Masers and lasers {{built on}} Earth and masers {{that occur in}} space both require {{population}} inversion in order to operate, but {{the conditions under which}} population inversion occurs are very different in the two cases. Masers in laboratories have systems with high densities, which limits the transitions that may be used for masing, and requires using a <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity</b> in order to bounce light back and forth many times. Astrophysical masers are at low densities, and naturally have very long path lengths. At low densities, being out of thermal equilibrium is more easily achieved because thermal equilibrium is maintained by collisions, meaning population inversion can occur. Long path lengths provide photons traveling through the medium many opportunities to stimulate emission, and produce amplification of a background source of radiation. These factors accumulate to [...] "make interstellar space a natural environment for maser operation." [...] Astrophysical masers may be pumped either radiatively or collisionally. In radiative pumping, infrared photons with higher energies than the maser transition photons preferentially excite atoms and molecules to the upper state in the maser in order to produce population inversion. In collisional pumping, this population inversion is instead produced by collisions that excite molecules to energy levels above that of the upper maser level, and then the molecule decays to the upper maser level by emitting photons.|$|E

2500|$|In the reflex {{klystron}} the electron beam {{passes through a}} single <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity.</b> The electrons are fired into {{one end of the}} tube by an electron gun. After passing through the <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity</b> they are reflected by a negatively charged reflector electrode for another pass through the cavity, where they are then collected. [...] The electron beam is velocity modulated when it first passes through the cavity. The formation of electron bunches takes place in the drift space between the reflector and the cavity. The voltage on the reflector must be adjusted so that the bunching is at a maximum as the electron beam re-enters the <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity,</b> thus ensuring a maximum of energy is transferred from the electron beam to the RF oscillations in the cavity. The reflector voltage may be varied slightly from the optimum value, which results in some loss of output power, but also in a variation in frequency. This effect is used to good advantage for automatic frequency control in receivers, and in frequency modulation for transmitters. The level of modulation applied for transmission is small enough that the power output essentially remains constant. At regions far from the optimum voltage, no oscillations are obtained at all.|$|E
2500|$|The {{magnetron}} is a self-oscillating device requiring no external elements {{other than}} a power supply. [...] A well-defined threshold anode voltage must be applied before oscillation will build up; this voltage {{is a function of}} the dimensions of the <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity,</b> and the applied magnetic field. In pulsed applications there is a delay of several cycles before the oscillator achieves full peak power, and the build-up of anode voltage must be coordinated with the build-up of oscillator output.|$|E

2500|$|In {{classical}} optics, {{light is}} {{thought of as}} electromagnetic waves radiating from a source. Often, coherent laser light is thought of as light that is emitted by many such sources that are in phase. Actually, the picture of one photon being in-phase with another is not valid in quantum theory. [...] Laser radiation is produced in a <b>resonant</b> <b>cavity</b> where the resonant frequency of the cavity {{is the same as}} the frequency associated with the atomic electron transitions providing energy flow into the field. [...] As energy in the resonant mode builds up, the probability for stimulated emission, in that mode only, increases. [...] That is a positive feedback loop in which the amplitude in the resonant mode increases exponentially until some non-linear effects limit it. [...] As a counter-example, a light bulb radiates light into a continuum of modes, and there is nothing that selects any one mode over the other. The emission process is highly random in space and time (see thermal light). In a laser, however, light is emitted into a resonant mode, and that mode is highly coherent. Thus, laser light is idealized as a coherent state. (Classically we describe such a state by an electric field oscillating as a stable wave. [...] See Fig.1) ...|$|E
