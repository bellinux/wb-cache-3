5000|$|Many {{countries}} utilize {{administrative detention}} to hold illegal immigrants - those {{arriving at a}} country's borders without proper authorization - as an interim step to either deportation or the obtainment of proper legal status. Immigration detention is controversial because it presents a clash between traditional notions of individual liberty and the territorial sovereignty of states. Comparative studies on administrative detention practices of different countries found that those experiencing large-scale influxes of illegal migrants by sea (such as the United States and Australia) typically have the most draconian systems. Proponents of administrative detention for illegal immigrants claim that detention is required since these immigrants have not committed any crime for which they could be prosecuted under existing laws, and that allowing them to await their potential deportation while not in custody runs a <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> their <b>absconding.</b> Opponents maintain that alternatives to detention exist, and that such alternatives are preferable {{because they do not}} violate personal liberty, as well as being less of a financial burden to the state. Among the alternatives suggested are supervised release to a non-governmental organization (NGO), the release into the custody of a private citizen who will guarantee the immigrant's participation in immigration hearings, and [...] "open detention" [...] centers with mandatory reporting requirements.|$|R

Absconding is increasingly being recognized as a problem within mental health settings with significant risks for consumers. This study examines absconding behaviours across three acute care wards within an Australian psychiatric hospital campus over a 12 -month period. A descriptive statistical analysis determined the rate of absconding from 49 consumers who absconded 64 times. The absconding rate was 13. 33 % (absconding events), with most absconding events arising from males diagnosed with schizophrenia (57. 14 %) aged between 20 and 29 years, and with 62. 50 % of absconding events occurring whilst consumers were on their first 21 -day detention order. Nearly half of all absconding events were by consumers who had absconded previously, with the highest proportion of events occurring during nursing handover. A profile of people who abscond, time of day of absconding, legal status and repeated absconding behaviours are described. The emergent profile of consumers who absconded within this study bears some similarities to that described in overseas research, although in this study consumers were slightly older and 25 % of absconders were female.

50|$|Psychiatric {{assessment}} in hospital settings is typically a multidisciplinary process, with contributions from psychiatric nurses, occupational therapists, psychologists and social workers. A psychiatrist takes a history and carries out a mental state examination and physical examination as described above. A nursing {{assessment in}}cludes <b>risk</b> assessment (<b>risk</b> <b>of</b> suicide, aggression, <b>absconding</b> from hospital, self-harm, sexual safety in hospital and medication compliance), physical health screening, and obtaining background personal and health {{information from the}} person being admitted and their carers. The immediate purpose of the nursing assessment {{is to determine the}} required level of care and supervision, and to have a plan to manage disturbed behavior. Assessment could include a visit to the person's home, for direct observation of the social and living environment. The role of a psychologist includes the use of psychological tests: structured diagnostic instruments such as the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory or psychometric tests such as the WISC or WAIS, to assist with diagnosis and formulation of the person's problems. A psychologist might contribute to the team's assessment by providing a psychological formulation or behavioral analysis, which is an analysis, through systematic observation, of the factors which trigger or perpetuate the presenting problems.|$|R

In this study we assessed whether opening the entrance door of an acute psychiatric ward influences absconding behaviour. Methods: An acute psychiatric ward was primarily closed (91. 4 %) {{for six months and}} primarily open (75. 6 %) for six months over the time period of one year. In this one year period, 337 patients were treated (206 male, age: 40 ± 16 years) : 60. 2 % of the patients had schizophrenia, 13. 6 % had affective disorders, 11. 6 % suffered from addiction and 14. 5 % displayed other diagnoses. Results: In terms of age (t = 0. 026, df = 335, p = 0. 979), gender (chi² = 1. 6, df = 1, p = 0. 13), diagnoses (chi² = 7. 337, df = 1, p = 0. 062) and duration of stay (t = - 0. 90, df = 335, p = 0. 928), we found {{no significant differences between the}} patients admitted in the closed and those admitted in the open ward period.

Despite the research results in the English speaking countries, there is no research on this topic in Germany. Methods: Naturalistic study of absconders and control groups over two years of a psychiatric unit with an open-door policy. Data were collected from case records and official forms <b>of</b> <b>absconding.</b> In a prospective study over half a year all absconders were interviewed. Results: Patients were compulsory detained on 846 admissions (13. 7 % of all admissions). 97 admissions resulted in 148 incidents <b>of</b> <b>absconding</b> involving 72 patients. Typical absconders are younger than 35 years, chronical schizophrenic with an alcohol/drug comorbidity, unmarried, living from social welfare. Only 55, 4 % of absconders were regarded as harmful to others or themselves. 39. 3 % incidents <b>of</b> <b>absconding</b> took place during therapeutic activities outside the ward. The main-causes <b>of</b> <b>absconding</b> were conflicts with staff-members or patients and too restrictive regulations of absence. Only 3 absconders did not return.

40|$|There is {{a better}} way of dealing with the needs of {{refugees}} arriving in Australia – whether with or without a visa, by boat or by plane. This 2002 document has been added to APO as it outlines how the process could be done with little need for detention. The Better Way will not compromise Australia’s security, health or community values, and will actually be cheaper. There are alternatives to detention that do not compromise Australia’s security, are cheaper, more humane and which strengthen our sense of community. So what {{is a better}} way? Rather than being classified by how they arrived here, asylum seekers should be classified by their care needs and likely security risk. This would allow more refugees to be housed more cheaply in the community. The Better Way is a combination of three approaches:• Early evaluation of refugees to work out whether anyone poses a security risk, and whether there is a <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>absconding</b> if they are placed in low-security housing• Case management by a social worker from a national welfare agency to work with people and families to ensure they understand Australia’s refugee system, and counsel people as they move through the legal process• Three accommodation options that house people according to a security assessment and care needs. Security is a feature. For example:• Community management for those considered at low risk, or no risk to the community or unlikely to abscond (this may include women and children, families and young people) • Medium security hostel accommodation for those considered medium risk or requiring intensive services• Continued detention for those considered high risk. The Better Way booklet is based on the JAS proposed alternative approaches to asylum seekers: Reception and Transitional Processing System   (JAS, June 2002).

40|$|Bibliography: pages 92 - 98. Using {{a systems}} {{theoretical}} orientation {{the objective of}} this study was to implement a strategic approach for psychotherapeutic intervention with six male institutionalized white adolescents at a local custodial school. It was hypothesized that a strategic approach would control absconding for the duration of the investigation. Surveys of the literature were undertaken to provide the background to psychotherapeutic intervention with adolescents in custodial institutions, strategic psychotherapy and absconding. Absconding was selected as the condition for evaluating the interventions because it was an unambiguous indicator of school-based recidivism, viz., the adolescent was either on the property or he was not. The study was structured as a design-and-demonstrate investigation. Audiotape recordings were made during the sessions. Transcriptions of characteristic procedures and sequences of the strategic approach to psychotherapeutic intervention were presented, inter alia, paradoxes, reframing, metaphors, rituals, the declaration of therapeutic impotence. Evaluation of the interventions was based on follow-up interviews with the subjects and a qualitative analysis of <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>absconding</b> aver the course of the intervention process. At the end of the investigation there was some evidence which suggested that five out of the six subjects were not as committed to absconding as they had claimed to be at the beginning of the study. The design of the study did not allow for the conclusion that the strategic approach for controlling absconding was of greater merit than any other form of intervention or no intervention at all. It was noted, however, that twelve of the eighteen potential subjects for the study indicated that they would abscond as soon as the opportunity arose. Therefore it was recommended that the issue of absconding be given priority in therapy on the admission of each new pupil. Given a strategic approach to addressing the issue of absconding in therapy, attention was drawn to a major aim of this type of intervention, viz., to generate a sense of personal autonomy. Hence a further recommendation was that once a pupil had made a commitment not to abscond, his sense of autonomy would need to be supported by an expeditious transfer to one of the more open hostels...|$|E
40|$|There is a humane, {{cost-effective}} {{alternative to}} mandatory detention, says John Wilson While {{the news that}} the asylum-seekers on Nauru have ended their hunger strike is to be welcomed, Australia’s system of mandatory detention remains the harshest in the Western world. The high rates of self-harm, hunger strikes and riots that occur in detention centres will continue while innocent and traumatised people, who have lost any hope, remain locked up. While many Australians, including our politicians, are increasingly concerned about our treatment of asylum- seekers, some don’t realise there is a better way of managing our borders and detailed alternatives to mandatory detention do exist. Our political leaders can no longer ignore the viable and effective alternatives that can help solve the harmful, inhumane and costly problems of Australia’s current system. The Brotherhood of St Laurence’s alternative, detailed in our report A Better Way: Refugees, Detention and Australians will address the significant problems of the current system. Our proposal is not only humane, our principal concern, but it is cost effective and it does not compromise Australia’s security and immigration processes. Moreover, a commissioned study by Milbur Consulting in 2003 found our way to be 18 per cent cheaper than the current system of mandatory detention. In our proposal, early evaluation of asylum-seekers can quickly identify those who pose no security risk or <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>absconding.</b> An ongoing risk assessment system to minimise absconding would be used by welfare agencies, using both standard reporting requirements (used by parole systems for example) and implicit ones (for example the reliance of asylum seekers on welfare agencies for their survival). However the Australian public should know that there is clear evidence that shows the fear of absconding has been exaggerated. Figures from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs show that in the period 1996 to 1998 no asylum-seeker released into the community failed to meet their reporting obligations. More recently from 2000 to 2003 the Hotham Mission, which provides assistance to hundreds of asylum-seekers including those released from detention, found none had absconded. A type of implicit compliance also lies in the fact DIMIA will always know the outcome of the claims processed before the asylum- seekers. In addition, all refugees arriving by boat are screened by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, and in August 2002 the director- general of ASIO told federal parliament that of 5986 new arrivals not one was found to be a security risk. In fact 90 per cent were found to be refugees fleeing persecution. Regardless, our way would not undermine Australia’s security and immigration processes. Thorough security checks would be conducted and any that are determined to be a high security risk would be confined to immigration detention. While their refugee claims are processed, asylum-seekers who pose no risk would be accommodated in migrant hostel-style accommodation or in community housing. This would reduce the current cost considerably. In December 2002 DIMIA figures estimated the cost of holding asylum- seekers in Australian detention centres equated to $ 160 per person per day. Our system, where people are released into a community management system, has been costed by Milbur Consulting at $ 60 per person per day, representing superior outcomes and significant savings. We have confidence that the involvement of case workers from reputable welfare agencies would ensure asylum- seekers would be systematically linked into care systems and compliance systems. Case managers would help asylum- seekers understand Australia’s refugee system, and counsel and prepare them for the Government’s decision about their future. This includes helping them to be better prepared for eventual settlement if they are accepted as a refugee or helping them to make plans to leave Australia if they are not successful. Many of these suggested practices are already being used in compliance systems around the country, for example in the juvenile justice and parole systems. A closely monitored reception and transitional processing system for asylum- seekers provides a realistic reform that solves many of the serious problems that currently exist. It would enable the Australian Government to process people with respect, decency and compassion. It would bridge the gap between current detention practices and well-tested community practices. It will also reduce the high cost to the taxpayer of the current high security, one- size-fits all detention centres, including the costly Pacific Solution. There would be multiple winners if Australia operated an alternative to mandatory detention. People who have fled brutal regimes and danger and are seeking Australia’s protection would receive fair and humane treatment while their refugee claims are being tested. The Australian community, including politicians, would also win as we would no longer need to feel diminished as a nation for the inhumane system that keeps innocent children and adults alike imprisoned in high security settings.

40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in [International Journal of Culture and Mental Health] on [19 Nov 2010], available online: [URL] morbidity among minority populations {{is believed to be}} higher than in the general population due to unmet healthcare needs and where significant health inequalities are experienced within culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) populations. Absconding (psychiatric patients running away from hospital) is a high-risk event and has been linked to harm to self and others. Very little research has been conducted into the <b>absconding</b> behaviours <b>of</b> people from a CALD background. In this study, a population of in-patients from a CALD background who absconded from a psychiatric hospital was examined. Areas of analysis included identification of CALD patients who absconded more than once, diagnosis, age, ward <b>of</b> <b>absconding</b> and time <b>of</b> <b>absconding</b> events. Approximately one-in-six patients from a CALD background absconded in the present study, indicating that absconding is a problem of sufficient extent to warrant greater attention. The authors conclude that more efforts should be made to restructure pathways to mental health care needs among CALD populations...|$|R

50|$|In 1848, the Whig Party {{nominated}} Miller to {{run against}} incumbent Democratic Congressman William H. Thompson. Thompson was declared the winner by the state's election canvassers, but Miller accused Thompson <b>of</b> <b>absconding</b> with the voting rolls from the election. The U.S. House resolved the contest over two years after it occurred, by deciding that neither Thompson nor Miller was entitled to the seat. That decision forced a special election, which Miller won. Thus, from December 20, 1850 to March 3, 1851 he was the First District's duly elected member of the Thirty-first Congress.|$|R
