500|$|Despite an {{incomplete}} {{understanding of the}} principles behind them, in some ways Evans's thinking {{about the potential for}} steam engines was once again far ahead of its time. In the postscript of the Steam Engineer's Guide, Evans noted that drawing a vacuum on water reduces its boiling point and cools it. He further observed that a vacuum would have the same effect upon ether, and the resulting cooling should be sufficient to produce ice. He went on to describe a <b>piston</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> apparatus to produce this effect, and also showed that a compression cylinder, or the compression stroke of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> should produce heat in a condenser. Thus Evans had produced the first detailed and theoretically coherent design for a vapor-compression refrigerator, identifying all the major components (expander, cooling coil, compressor and condenser) of a refrigeration cycle, leaving some to credit him as the 'grandfather of refrigeration'. [...] Although Evans never developed a working model of his designs, and {{there is no evidence that}} he ever attempted to, Evans in his later life worked and associated extensively with fellow inventor Jacob Perkins on steam engines and the potential for refrigeration. Perkins would later develop and build a refrigeration device for which he received patents in 1834–1835, employing much the same principles originally put forward by Evans.|$|R

40|$|During {{production}} proteins {{are exposed}} to various stresses which can cause protein denaturation and inactivation. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of shear forces which can occur during filling operations of pharmaceutical solutions with dosing equipment. Such shear forces possibly have a negative influence on shear sensitive substances and may lower the quality and yield of the final drug product. In the scope of this work a peristaltic pump and different sizes of <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pumps (RPPs) were compared in respect to induced protein aggregation due to shear damage caused by dosing equipment. The influence of various parameters such as filling speed, dosing volume, friction surface and exposure to air-liquid interfaces and on the intensity of the shear stress was examined. A characteristic <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pump parameter δ was developed and introduced as an indicator describing the potential of a <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pump to cause protein damage. Furthermore, excipients were tested on their ability to protect the model protein against shear-induced damage. 2 model proteins in solution, lactase (β-galactosidase) and rituximab, a recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody, were used and tested for their suitability as model proteins. No activity loss was seen for the sheared lactase solution, therefore finally rituximab was chosen as a model protein. The level of protein aggregation in the unsheared and sheared solutions was determined by Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) and SEC-HPLC. TEM was used to visualise protein aggregation. It was found that protein aggregation was induced by <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pumps however not by the peristaltic pump. The degree of protein damage was marginally low for large <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> pumps such as RPP 3 and 4 and showed a considerable increase with smaller sizes like RPP 1 and 2.

40|$|Abstract. Twin screw <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> is an {{important}} kind of dry <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> which is widely used in the oil-free vacuum system. The design of the screw rotor profile directly influences the working performance and manufacture cost of the screw pumps. In this paper, a new rotor profile for twin screw <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> is introduced which is comprised of the cycloid curve, the dedendum circle arc, the involute curve and the addendum circle arc. The processes of three-dimensional modeling, motion simulation, interference checking and structural optimization for twin screw <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> are studied by means of Solidworks software. The works provide theoretical basis for optimal designing and reference for test prototype manufacturing. The results showed {{the performance of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> according with the designer’s intention...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} a project funded by Regione Toscana aimed at {{reducing}} the power absorption of auxiliary devices in vehicles are presented. In particular the design, testing and application of a magnetorheological clutch (MR) is proposed, aimed at disengaging the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> which draws in air from the power-brake booster chamber, {{in order to reduce the}} device power absorption. Several clutch preliminary studies done to choose the clutch geometry and the magnetic field supply are illustrated. The final choice consisted in an MR clutch with permanent magnet, which satisfied size, torque and fail-safe specifications. The clutch characteristics, in terms of torque versus slip, were obtained experimentally for three different clutch prototypes on an ad-hoc developed test bench. As result of a preliminary simulation, a comparison between the power absorption of a current production <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> an innovative <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> and both <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> coupled with the MR clutch is presented. The New European Driving Cycle is considered for simulating the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> operation both in urban and highway driving. Results show that the use of the innovative <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> reduces the device consumption of about 35 %, whereas the use of MR clutch coupled with the innovative <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> reduces it up to about 44 % in urban driving and 50 % in highway driving...|$|R

50|$|A vacuum is {{initially}} created by connecting a closed container to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump.</b> After achieving a vacuum, the container can be sealed, or the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> {{can be left}} running. Getters are especially important in sealed systems, such as vacuum tubes, including cathode ray tubes (CRTs), and vacuum insulated panels, which must maintain a vacuum {{for a long time}}. This is because the inner surfaces of the container release absorbed gases {{for a long time after}} the vacuum is established. The getter continually removes this residual gas as it is produced. Even in systems which are continually evacuated by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> getters are also used to remove residual gas, often to achieve a higher <b>vacuum</b> than the <b>pump</b> could achieve alone. Although it weighs almost nothing and has no moving parts, a getter is itself a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
