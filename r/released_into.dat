5|$|Whisky Galore! was <b>released</b> <b>into</b> UK cinemas on 16 June 1949; {{the film}} was financially successful. It was <b>released</b> <b>into</b> the US in December that year, though because of {{restrictions}} {{on the use of}} the names of alcoholic drinks in titles, {{the film was}} renamed Tight Little Island. In France, the film was retitled Whisky à gogo; the name was later used as that of a discothèque in Paris.|$|E

5|$|A manga {{adaptation}} was serialized in Square Enix's Monthly GFantasy magazine.

The manga made its debut in the January 2013 issue of GFantasy {{which was published in}} Japan on December 18, 2012. It ran for twenty-five chapters and ended in the November 2014 issue which was published on October 18, 2014. The chapters have been collected and <b>released</b> <b>into</b> four tankōbon volumes between March 27, 2013 and December 27, 2014.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{atmospheric}} {{release of}} radioactive gas followed the Soviet Chagan test of 15 January 1965 in present-day Kazakhstan. Roughly 20% of the radioactive debris {{produced by the}} 140-kiloton detonation was <b>released</b> <b>into</b> the atmosphere, with some fallout occurring over Japan. The US complained to Moscow, but no subsequent action was taken. On 25 April 1966, the Pin Stripe underground test in Nevada (part of Operation Flintlock) experienced a venting malfunction and produced a radioactive plume headed towards the Midwestern US; the AEC determined that the test did not threaten human health.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when <b>released</b> <b>into</b> {{an enclosed}} space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E

5|$|Balcon {{disliked the}} film and his initial thought was to cut its running time down to an hour and {{classify}} it as a second feature. He did not provide Mackendrick with another directoral role, but assigned him to second unit work. Another of Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added additional footage at Ealing Studios and re-edited the film; this version was the one <b>released</b> <b>into</b> cinemas.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} its sides has a higher surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be <b>released</b> <b>into</b> the atmosphere. This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the three}} climactic eruptions {{released}} vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America, falling many hundreds of miles away.

5|$|In {{most places}} on Fishing Creek, {{there is not}} enough {{dissolved}} aluminum to be toxic, although East Branch Fishing Creek has aluminum concentrations of over 100μg per liter, approaching a lethal level for fish. Fishing Creek itself and all its other tributaries have concentrations of less than 70μg per liter. The concentration is seasonal: aluminum trapped in frozen ground is <b>released</b> <b>into</b> the streams when the soil thaws. As a result, aluminum levels in the creek peak in March and April and drop to almost zero in the summer.|$|E
