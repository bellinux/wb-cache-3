5000|$|Because of {{the wide}} {{distribution}} of the letters after publication, scholars ask the question: who decided the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> contained in these field letters? Although the Jesuits tried to avoid disclosing any compromise in their principles, “it is possible to detect evidence of soul searching and shifting points of view” relative to their success at converting Native peoples. After extensive cultural immersion, the missionaries may have moved from tolerating native belief systems to assuming native idiosyncrasies. Jesuit officials in France would be liable to omit any threat to their philosophies in the final document. The issue concerns less the basic accuracy of the Jesuit Relations than the “manipulative literary devices” employed by the editors. Greer notes that European writings were popularly documented {{in one of two}} forms, as travel narratives or as encyclopedic catalogs. He notes that the Jesuits obscured the boundaries between these two genres in an attempt to raise funds to continue Jesuit missions in New France: “One of the peculiarities of the Jesuit Relations is that they combine both types of writing: Jacques Marquette’s personal narrative of his trip down the Mississippi, for example, shares space with Jean de Brébeuf’s systematic description of Huron society.” ...|$|E
50|$|Stinchcombe appealed. The {{appellate court}} held that the Crown has a legal duty to {{disclose}} all relevant information to the defence. The fruits of the investigation, in its possession, are not the property of the Crown, for use in securing a conviction; they are the property of the public, to be used to ensure that justice is done. The obligation to disclose is subject to a discretion with respect to the withholding of information, and to the timing and manner of disclosure. Crown counsel had a duty to respect the rules of privilege and to protect the identity of informers; a discretion must also be exercised with respect to the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> The Crown's discretion was reviewable by the trial judge, who should be guided by the general principle that information should not be withheld if there is a reasonable possibility that it will impair the right of the accused to make full answer and defence. The absolute withholding of information which is relevant to the defence can only be justified {{on the basis of the}} existence of a legal privilege which excludes the information from disclosure. This privilege is reviewable, however, on the ground that it is not a reasonable limit on the right to make full answer and defence in a particular case.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the House of Lords (Lords Cohen, Guest and Hodson) held {{that there was a}} possibility of a conflict of interest, because the solicitor and beneficiary might have come to Boardman for advice as to the purchases of the shares. They owed fiduciary duties (to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest) because they were negotiating over use of the trust's shares. The majority disagreed about the nature and <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> used by Boardman and Phipps. Lord Cohen said the information is not truly property and it does not necessarily follow that, because an agent acquired information and opportunity while acting in a fiduciary capacity, he is accountable. His liability to account depends on the facts. His Lordship regarded Boardman to be liable because he acquired the information {{in the course of the}} fiduciary relationship and because of the fiduciary relationship. The other two members of the majority, Lord Hodson and Lord Guest, opined that information can constitute property in appropriate circumstances and in the current case, the confidential information acquired can be properly regarded as property of the trust. Therefore, Boardman was speculating with trust property and should be liable. The majority agreed unanimously that liability to account for the profits made by virtue of a fiduciary relationship is strict and does not depend on fraud or absence of bona fides, and so Phipps and Boardman would have to account for their profits. However, they were generously remunerated for their services to the trust.|$|E

Using the equity valuation model as suggested by Ohlson (1995), firstly, the value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> earnings and book values of equity produced under Turkish Local Standards (during 2000 - 2002) and under IFRS (during 2005 - 2009) is analyzed.

Additionally, the results provide that book value of equity is more value relevant than earnings.
