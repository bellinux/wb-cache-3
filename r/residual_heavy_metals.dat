40|$|The {{crystallization}} kinetics for the precipitation {{of calcium}} carbonate and magnesium hydroxide {{in the presence of}} cadmium, lead, and zinc were studied. The kinetics for the precipitation have been studied in a continuous reactor operated under MSMPR (mixed suspension mixed product removal) conditions. Reactor residence times, effluent alkalinity conditions, and initial heavy metal concentrations (acting as impurity) were varied to determine these kinetics. The crystal size distribution was measured using the Coulter Counter Model TA II, allowing sizing of the crystals in the 6 to 75 micron size range. Steady state conditions in which the residual hardness, alkalinity distribution, and particle size distribution remains fairly constant after approximately 11 residence times, was observed. The MSMPR crystallizer analysis of the population balance provides an adequate description of the particle size distribution. ^ Residual calcium levels were varied in the presence of different types of heavy metals. Cadmium and zinc inhibit {{the precipitation of}} calcium carbonate resulting in a higher residual hardness level, about 50 - 85 mg/l as CaCO(, 3), while lead promotes the crystallization of calcium carbonate resulting in lower residual hardness level, about 25 - 50 mg/l as CaCO(, 3). The removal of magnesium hardness was not affected in the presence of cadmium, lead, or zinc. The predominant form of the calcium carbonate precipitated in this research was the calcite form, {{with a small amount of}} the aragonite formed. The percentage of aragonite crystals increased with the addition of magnesium hardness. ^ Heavy metals can be removed effectively in this operation. The removal efficiency exceeded 97. 0 % for cadmium and zinc for an initial concentration level of 5. 0 mg/l and removals exceeded 99. 0 % for lead with an initial concentration level of 1. 22 mg/l. The X-ray diffraction pattern data, the scanning electron microscope photographs, and the <b>residual</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> concentration all suggest the major mechanisms involved for removal of heavy metals from solution in the lime-soda ash water softening process are: surface adsorption for cadmium and zinc removal, and isomorphic inclusion for lead removal. ^ A batch softening study was also performed which exhibited a different type of behavior as compared to those performed with the continuous MSMPR crystallization.

But some of them not only are not necessary, but also they are very toxic and carcinogen. In this research the rate of Mobility and Bioavailability of heavy metals associated with airborne particulates matter such as Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu, Fe, Ni and Cr have been measured. &# 13; Methods: The sequential extraction {{has been used for}} releasing of heavy metales from solid samples as airborne particulates matter on the paper filter samples. &# 13; Five stages in the sequential extraction procedure developed by Tessier, et al, was first used for extraction and determination of the concentration and percentages of heavy metals which could be released in each stage. In the 1 st stage, exchangable metals were released. The sample was extracted with 10 ml of ammonium acetat, pH= 7 for 1 h. Then the sample was centrifuged at 2000 rpm. The solution of extraction, was analysed for Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu, Fe, Ni and Cr. In the 2 nd stage, heavy metals bound to carbonates which were sensitive to pH were extracted. The residue from stage 1, with 10 ml of sodium acetate 1 M the pH was adjusted to 5 with acetic acid. Then the sample was centrifuged as stage 1. In the third stage heavy metals bound to iron and manganese oxides were extracted. The residue from stage 2 was reacted with 10 ml hydroxyl amine hydrochloride at 25 % v/v. In the 4 th stage metals bound to sulfides and organic compounds were extracted. The residue from stage 3 with 5 ml nitric acid and 5 ml hydrogen peroxide 30 % and heated at 85 ° C.

40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, {{non-ferrous}} metallurgy has produced large quantities of wastes which were piled in slag heaps. Due to the high <b>residual</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> content in slag, such heaps may represent a threat for the surrounding environment and human health. Therefore, natural or assisted revegetation of slag heaps is usually considered as a commonsense mitigation measure since it may reduce the dispersion of contaminants by wind or water erosion, runoff and water percolation through the substrate. However, the effect of plants on the leaching of heavy metals is still unclear. This study aimed to determine to what extent the plant colonization could affect the leaching of heavy metals (Cd, Pb and Zn) from two contrasted slag. Columns made of PVC were filled in with 2 kg of a mixture consisting in 1900 g of quartz (500 - 1000 µm) and 100 g of slag (100 - 500 µm). Two plants (Agrostis tenuis and Lupinus albus) were separately grown in the columns for seven weeks. A control treatment, i. e. without plants, was also carried out. All columns were continuously irrigated at a slow rate with a macronutrient solution. Nitrogen was supplied as nitrate form in order to avoid exacerbating acidification of the rhizosphere, which could mask other plant effects such as organic molecules exudation. Concentrations of heavy metals in leachates and in plants were measured every week {{and at the end of}} the experiment, respectively. For Cd, Pb and Zn, the metal amounts exported by both plants were negligible compared to the metal amounts lost by leaching. However, the presence of A. tenuis largely increased the concentrations of Cd, Pb and Zn in leachates from both substrates while L. albus only induced higher metal concentrations in leachates from one of them. Moreover, when substrates were covered by A. tenuis, the concentrations of metals in leachates were sometimes so high that the reduction of the percolated solution volume due to plant uptake was not sufficient to reduce the total metal mass exported. When plants were present, acidification of leachates was not observed. This suggested that the increase of heavy metals concentrations in leachates in presence of plants was related to other factors than pH. Results of this study demonstrated the potential of growing plants to mobilize heavy metals from slag and stressed the need to carefully select the plant species for revegetation strategies...|$|E

40|$|Biological {{anaerobic}} sulfate reduction to sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) can {{be performed}} in a single-stage reactor in which the biological sulfate reduction to sulfide and metal precipitation occur simultaneously, or in two-stage reactors where the two follow sequentially. The single stage process may be more cost-effective and simpler to operate. However, some factors, such as acidic nature of acid mine drainage (AMD) {{and the presence of}} the <b>residual</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the system may pose an inhibitory and toxic effect on SRB and limit the application of the process. In addition, some studies suggest that beyond a certain level of metal loading, the process of sulfate reduction and the corresponding metal precipitation by the sulfide generated is adversely affected. In {{the first part of this}} study, the effect of different concentrations of copper on anaerobic sulfate reduction in semi continuous stirred tank reactors (SCSTRs) at 35 ± 2 ºC was investigated. Four parallel SCSTRs received synthetic wastewater containing copper at various concentrations. They were optimized for pH and were operated at a predetermined COD/SO 42 -. Reactors receiving lower concentration (3 ̆c 200 mg/L) of copper showed a very little negative effect in their performance. However, at higher concentrations (3 ̆e 400 mg/L), performance was inhibited, which could be attributed to the presence of metal precipitates in these reactors. Batch kinetic experiments confirmed this inhibition of the sulfate reduction process in the presence of high concentration of metal precipitates. The cultures withdrawn at various process conditions were analyzed for their respective microbial pattern. It showed that certain concentrations of copper precipitates adversely affected the population of sulfate reducers. Reactors receiving 0 mg/L and 200 mg/L of copper showed more similarity in terms of their respective sulfate reducers’ population. The presence of thiosulfate reducers in microbial community may be an evidence for the existence of an alternate pathway in dissimilatory anaerobic sulfate reduction that generates thiosulfate as the intermediate byproducts during the reduction of sulfite to sulfide. In the second part of the study, two upflow anaerobic hybrid reactors (UAHR) were designed to overcome the inhibition of SRB by the metal precipitates. Two identical UAHRs received simulated wastewater with COD/SO 4 2 - of 1, where the sulfate concentration was 3040 mg/L. One UAHR was used to represent the single-stage process, and the influent contained metal (copper) in the feed. The other UAHR represented the first stage of the two-stage process. The performance of the two processes was compared over different hydraulic, organic, and sulfate loading rates by varying the HRT between 40 and 2. 5 days at a temperature of 33 ± 3 °C. The results show that both sulfate reduction and copper precipitation in the single stage process were similar to or better than the two stage process over the entire duration of the study. The rate of copper removal in the single stage process was found to reach up to two times of that of the two stage process. This suggests that the proposed UAHR configuration was successful in overcoming the Inhibition of SRB by the metal precipitates. In the single stage reactor for which S/Cu was higher than 1, copper was precipitated in the form of CuS. The same happened for the second stage of two stage process once S/Cu was set to be higher than 1. This was confirmed with the equilibrium calculations using MINTEQ speciation model. However, the results of the MINTEQ showed that at S/Cu of less than 1, additional amount of copper is precipitated in the forms of Cu 3 (PO 4) 2 and CuO...|$|E

The respective <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> contamination was Pb (0, 00 - 0, 92 ppm), Cd (0, 00 - 0, 60 ppm) and Hg (0, 00 - 0, 03 ppm), while the organophosphate pesticide residues were less than 0005 ppm or below the maximum limit set by Indonesian National Standard (ISN) 7313 : 2008 on limit maximum pesticide residues in agricultural products. In conclusion, the meat, liver and kidneys of cattle distributed traditionally at the market in Pekanbaru city had contamination levels of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> (Pb, Cd and Hg) and pesticide residues organophosphate which were under maximum conditions specifie...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the pollution load index, fraction distributions, and mobility of Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn in garden and paddy soils collected from a Pb/Zn mine in Chenzhou City, China. The samples were analyzed using Leleyter and Probst&# 39;s sequential extraction procedures. Total metal concentrations including Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn exceeded the maximum permissible limits for soils set by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, and the order of the pollution index was Cd > Zn > Pb > Cu, indicating that the soils from both sites seriously suffered from <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> pollution, especially Cd. The sums of metal fractions were in agreement with the total contents of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals.</b> However, there were significant differences in fraction distributions of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in garden and paddy soils. The <b>residual</b> fractions of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> were the predominant form with 43. 0 % for Pb, 32. 3 % for Cd, 33. 5 % for Cu, and 44. 2 % for Zn in garden soil, while 51. 6 % for Pb, 40. 4 % for Cd, 40. 3 % for Cu, and 40. 9 % for Zn in paddy soil. Furthermore, the proportions of water-soluble and exchangeable fractions extracted by the selected analytical methods were the lowest among all fractions. On the basis of the speciation of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals,</b> the mobility factor values of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> have the following order: Cd (25. 2 - 19. 8 %) > Cu (22. 6 - 6. 3 %) > Zn (9. 6 - 6. 0 %) > Pb (6. 7 - 2. 5 %) in both contaminated soils...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in using water treatment <b>residuals</b> (WTRs) for <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> removal from wastewater {{due to their}} low cost, availability, and high efficiency in removing various pollutants. In this study, novel water treatment residuals nanoparticles (nWTRs) were prepared using {{high energy ball milling}} and used for efficient removal of Cd(II) in single- and multi-ion systems. The WTR nanoparticles demonstrated high removal efficiency for Cd from aqueous solution as the adsorption capacities of nWTR were 17 and 10 times higher than those of bulk WTR in single- and multielement systems, respectively. Noticeably, Cd(II) adsorption was clearly suppressed in the multi-ion system as Cu and Pb form the most stable monohydroxo complexes. Fourier transmission infrared (FTIR) analyses suggested the participation of OH−, O-Al-O, FeOH, and FeOOH entities in the adsorption process. The stability of Cd-nWTR surface complexes is evident as less than 0. 2 % of adsorbed Cd(ll) was released at the highest Cd(II) concentration load after 4 consecutive desorption cycles. Moreover, the real efficiency of nWTR for Cd(II) removal from wastewater samples studied was calculated to be 98. 35 %. These results highlight the potential of nWTR for <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> removal from wastewater...|$|R

The <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> pollution and potential ecological risk were evaluated systematically using geoaccumulation index (Igeo) and Hakanson potential ecological risk index (H′). The results showed that the sampling sites from the estuaries of tributary flowing through downtowns and heavy industrial parks showed significantly (p <  0. 05) higher average concentrations of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the surface sediments, as compared to the other sampling sites. Chemical fractionation showed that Mn existed mainly in acid extractable fraction, Cu and Pb were mainly in reducible fraction, and As existed mainly in residual fraction in the surface sediments despite sampling sites. The sampling sites from the estuary of tributary flowing through downtown showed significantly (p <  0. 05) higher proportions of acid extractable and reducible fractions than the other sampling sites, which would pose a potential toxic risk to aquatic organisms as well as a potential threat to drinking water safety. As, Pb, Ni and Cu were at relatively high potential ecological risk with high Igeo values for some sampling locations. Hakanson potential ecological risk index (H′) showed the surface sediments from the tributary estuaries with high population density and rapid industrial development showed significantly (p <  0. 05) higher <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> pollution levels and potential ecological risk in the surface sediments, as compared to the other sampling sites...|$|R
40|$|Problems were {{experienced}} at Triangle's fuel ethanol plant with extended and incomplete fermentations. Direct lactic acid <b>residual</b> sugars and <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> analyses were done on plant samples {{to isolate the}} cause of the sub-optimal fermentations. Laboratory fermentation experiments were done using Triangle yeast and nutrients. Tests were done at various pHs and temperatures to ascertain levels of stress on the yeast. Copper was found in toxic levels in the proble~ fermentations, and the most probable source was the fertilizer-grade diammonium phosphate used as nutrient. Laboratory tests incorporating copper at varying conc~ntrations were done to investigate the effect on yeast population levels and on the fermentative capability ofthe yeast. Laboratory tests showed an effect on yeast populations at 16 ppm copper, and the level affecting ethanol fermentations was between 20 and 40 ppm.

New strain of giant miscanthus has been developed and was planted in two large trial sites (184 ha) in the lower reaches of the Geum River. To evaluate the susceptibility of the giant miscanthus as an bioenergy crop for the future, we investigated {{the influence of the}} giant miscanthus on the soil properties. The particle size, CEC, pH, EC, T-N, T-P, <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> total concentration, and <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> fractions of soil samples collected from abandoned field, 1 year old giant miscanthus field (1 st Year GM), and 2 year old giant miscanthus field (2 nd Year GM) at different depths of 0 ～ 15, 15 ～ 30, and 30 ～ 45 cm in April and August were analyzed. Results showed that the CEC and pH of the soil of the giant miscanthus field were lower than those of the soil of abandoned field. The EC of 2 nd GM was lower than that of abandoned field, indicating that the giant miscanthus may facilitate soil desalination process. The organic and sulfide fraction and <b>residual</b> fraction of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the giant miscanthus field was higher than in abandoned field, due to the low pH of the giant miscanthus field and the excretion of phytosiderophores by rhizome of the giant miscanthus.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{chemical}} amendments (zeolite, compost and calcium hydroxide) on the solubility of Pb, Cd and Zn in a contaminated soil were determined. The polluted soil {{was from the}} Southwest Sardinia, Italy. It showed very high total concentrations of Pb (19 663 mg kg − 1 d. m.), Cd (196 mg kg − 1 d. m.) and Zn (14 667 mg kg − 1 d. m.). The growth and uptake of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> by white lupin (Lupinus albus L., cv. Multitalia) in amended soils were also studied in a pot experiment under greenhouse conditions. Results showed that the amendments increased the <b>residual</b> fraction of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the soils, and decreased the <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> uptake by white lupin compared with the unamended control. Among the three amendments, compost and Ca(OH) 2 were the most efficient at reducing Pb and Zn uptake, while zeolite was the most efficient at reducing Cd uptake by the plants. White lupin growth was better in amended soils than in unamended control. The above ground biomass increased with a factor 1. 8 (soil amended with zeolite), 3. 6 (soil amended with compost) and 3. 1 (soil amended with Ca(OH) 2) with respect to unamended soil. The roots biomass increased with a factor 1. 4 (soil amended with zeolite), 5. 6 (soil amended with compost) and 4. 8 (soil amended with Ca(OH) 2). Results obtained suggest that the soil chemical treatment improved the performance of crops by reducing bioavailability of metals in the soils. However it would be therefore interesting to find a suitable mixture of these amendments to contemporarily immobilize the three main pollutants in the polluted soils...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{is focused}} on the issue of genetically {{modified}} organisms (GMOs) detection in the plants and derived products. Existing legislation in the European Union regulates monitoring of GMO and lays down rules for their labeling and traceability. The aim was to contribute to solving certain issues of critical points in GMO detection. The first point was DNA extraction. The problem was adressed to the example of DNA extraction from the fruit of papaya and candied papaya. For both food products the suitability of the selected extraction methods was verified and confirmed by amplification of a specific DNA sequence by PCR. The second critical point was related to PCR inhibitors. We observed the effect of real-time PCR inhibition due to the influence of the residual EDTA and the <b>residual</b> amount of <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> ions, which were present in laboratory plastic. In both examples, the inhibition affects the PCR efficiency. Another critical point in the GMO detection is use of screening elements. That work was focused on false positive results. Development of new methods for GMO detection was another goal of this work. We have developed the method for garden pea taxon-specific gene quantification by real-time PCR.

40|$|Abstract—In this study, the {{designed}} {{dual stage}} membrane bioreactor (MBR) system was conceptualized {{for the treatment}} of cyanide and <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in electroplating wastewater. The design consisted of a primary treatment stage to reduce the impact of fluctuations and the secondary treatment stage to remove the <b>residual</b> cyanide and <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> contaminants in the wastewater under alkaline pH conditions. The primary treatment stage contained hydrolyzed Citrus sinensis (C. sinensis) pomace and the secondary treatment stage contained active Aspergillus awamori (A. awamori) biomass, supplemented solely with C. sinensis pomace extract from the hydrolysis process. An average of 76. 37 %, 95. 37 %, 93. 26 and 94. 76 % and 99. 55 %, 99. 91 %, 99. 92 % and 99. 92 % degradation efficiency for total cyanide (T-CN), including the sorption of nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) were observed after the first and second treatment stages, respectively. Furthermore, cyanide conversion by-products degradation was 99. 81 % and 99. 75 for both formate (CHOO-) and ammonium (NH 4 +) after the second treatment stage. After the first, second and third regeneration cycles of the C. sinensis pomace in the first treatment stage, Ni, Zn and Cu removal achieved was 99. 13 %, 99. 12 % and 99. 04 % (first regeneration cycle), 98. 94 %, 98. 92 % and 98. 41 % (second regeneration cycle) and 98. 46 %, 98. 44 % and 97. 91 % (third regeneration cycle), respectively. There was relatively insignificant standard deviation detected in all the measured parameters in the system which indicated reproducibility of the remediation efficiency in this continuous system.

40|$|It was {{examined}} in this study that magnetic beads, which are assumed to be environmentally functional, could be effective in processing <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> that are water pollutants. For the purpose, magnetic beads containing carboxyl groups, which has strong binding force with <b>heavy</b> <b>metals,</b> are mixed with each Cd, Pb, Ni, Cu and Cr(III) solution, then stirred in pH 6. As a results of the process, it was proven that <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> bind quickly with magnetic beads through the reaction. In order to analyze <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentration, magnetic beads bind with <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> were collected by external magnetic force and dissolved in acid. The graphite furnace AAS was used to get <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentration melted in the acid solution. The results showed that <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> extractions by magnetic beads were influenced by the type and the concentration of a <b>heavy</b> <b>metal,</b> and over 90 % of a <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> can be extracted in ppm level save for Cr(III).

40|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>metal</b> {{pollution}} in soils {{is an important}} problem during recent decades. <b>Heavy</b> <b>metal</b> is harmful to ecosystem through the uptaking of plants in agricultural soils polluted by <b>heavy</b> <b>metals.</b> The mobility of <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> {{is affected by the}} changing of soil condition such as pH and Eh. Black carbon (B. C.), derived from crop residues, improves the fertility on soils, increases surface area, and cation exchangeable capacity, and decreases the mobility of <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> in soils. In this experiments, black carbon mixed with two soils polluted by <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> from Changhua in Taiwan with the ratio of 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1 %, and 5 % Black carbon under flooding condition to investigate the behavior of <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> in soils during flooding period. The results showed that soil became more anoxic with the increasing amount of black carbon added to the soils. With an increasing black carbon content, the concentrations of Cd, Ni, Zn, and Cu released into the soil solutions were reduced, due to the presences of black carbon. In the results of sequential extraction, the fraction of Fe-Mn oxides bounded decreased and transferred to other fractions. For example, the fraction of Fe-Mn oxides transferred to exchangeable for Cd, the fraction of Fe-Mn oxides transferred to the fraction of carbonate bounded in CHB soil and to the fraction of carbonate bounded and organic matter bounded in CHC for Ni, the fraction of Fe-Mn oxides transferred to the fraction of carbonate bounded for Zn. In addition, with the amount of black carbon increasingly, the fraction of organic matter bounded raised for Cu. After flooding, the <b>residual</b> fraction of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> increased. It shows that adding black carbon in soils cause the decreases in the concentration of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in soil solution and the redistribution of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in soils. 土壤中重金屬汙染的現象於近年來日益嚴重，受到重金屬汙染的農地土壤中，透過植物對於重金屬的吸收利用則會對生態造成危害，而重金屬在土壤中的有效性與移動性會受到環境條件的影響，如pH及Eh值的改變。於台灣農地土壤中常有將農業廢棄物現地焚燒的現象，燃燒農業廢棄物產生的黑炭置於土壤中可以增進地力，而其因有高比表面積、不易分解及高陽離子交換容量等特性，對於土壤中的汙染物也具有吸附能力。本研究利用台灣彰化縣兩處受到重金屬汙染的土壤，利用浸水孵育的方式模擬水田土壤，分別於土壤中添加 0 %、 0. 5 %、 1 %及 5 %的黑炭，探討浸水還原的環境中，黑炭的添加對於土壤中重金屬移動性與有效性的影響。 實驗結果顯示，土壤在浸水的環境中，溶液中的pH值提高、還原電位下降、鐵、錳離子濃度也隨之上升，且隨著黑炭添加比例的提高而土壤愈還原。在重金屬的濃度及型態分佈上，發現隨著黑炭添加的比例提高，溶液中鎘、鎳、鋅及銅的濃度隨之下降，有效性重金屬的含量也略為下降，表示黑炭於土壤中可作為一吸附劑以降低溶液中重金屬濃度及促成土壤中重金屬的型態重新分佈。於連續萃取的結果中，隨著土壤逐漸的還原，鐵錳氧化物的還原溶解會使鐵錳氧化物結合態中有所減少，而重金屬則可轉移至其他型態中，如鎘會由鐵錳氧化物轉移至交換態中、鎳於CHB土壤中會由鐵錳氧化物結合態轉移至碳酸鹽結合態，於CHC土壤中則會轉移至碳酸鹽結合態及有機質結合態；鋅則會由鐵錳氧化物結合態轉移至碳酸鹽結合態中；銅則隨著黑炭添加比例的提高，有機質結合態比例明顯的上升，而各種重金屬在浸水孵育後均增加其殘留態的含量。研究結果顯示，添加黑炭於土壤中會造成重金屬於溶液中的濃度減少，植物有效性的重金屬含量較為下降，也對於重金屬的型態分佈造成影響。摘要	I Abstract	II 目錄	III 表目錄	VI 圖目錄	VII 第一章、前言	 1 1 - 1 、研究緣起	 1 1 - 2 、研究目的	 2 第二章、前人研究	 3 2 - 1 、台灣農地土壤重金屬污染來源及現況	 3 2 - 2 、浸水土壤特性	 5 2 - 2 - 1 、pH值	 6 2 - 2 - 2 、Eh值	 7 2 - 2 - 3 、有機質	 8 2 - 2 - 4 、鐵、錳氧化物	 9 2 - 2 - 5 、硫化物	 11 2 - 3 、重金屬特性與其型態分佈	 12 2 - 3 - 1 、鎘 (Cadmium, Cd) 	 12 2 - 3 - 2 、鉻 (Chromium, Cr) 	 13 2 - 3 - 3 、鎳 (Nickel, Ni) 	 14 2 - 3 - 4 、銅 (Copper, Cu) 	 15 2 - 3 - 5 、鋅 (Zinc, Zn) 	 16 2 - 4 、黑炭的來源與特性	 17 2 - 4 - 1 、黑炭的來源	 17 2 - 4 - 2 、黑炭的特性與應用	 18 2 - 5 、離子交換樹脂評估重金屬有效性	 20 第三章、材料與方法	 23 3 - 1 、試驗材料	 23 3 - 1 - 1 、供試土壤	 23 3 - 1 - 2 、白金電極製備與校正	 23 3 - 1 - 3 、離子交換樹脂	 25 3 - 1 - 4 、稻稈黑炭的製備	 29 3 - 1 - 5 、孵育實驗裝置	 29 3 - 2 、土壤各項基本性質分析	 30 3 - 2 - 1 、土壤水分含量：重量法	 30 3 - 2 - 2 、土壤pH值	 30 3 - 2 - 3 、有機質含量測定：濕燒法 (Nelson and Sommers, 1996) 	 30 3 - 2 - 4 、陽離子交換容量：醋酸銨蒸餾法	 31 3 - 2 - 5 、土壤質地：比重計法	 32 3 - 2 - 6 、王水全量分析	 32 3 - 2 - 7 、重金屬形態測定	 33 3 - 3 、黑炭基本性質分析	 34 3 - 3 - 1 、陽離子交換容量：醋酸銨蒸餾法	 34 3 - 3 - 2 、重金屬含量：王水消化法	 35 3 - 3 - 3 、元素分析	 35 3 - 4 、孵育實驗	 36 3 - 4 - 1 、孵育實驗流程	 36 3 - 4 - 2 、離子交換樹脂脫附實驗流程	 38 第四章、結果與討論	 39 4 - 1 、土壤基本性質分析	 39 4 - 2 、黑炭基本性質分析	 40 4 - 3 、孵育實驗	 42 4 - 3 - 1 、浸水孵育期間土壤溶液pH的變化	 42 4 - 3 - 2 、浸水孵育期間土壤氧化還原電位之變化	 45 4 - 3 - 3 、浸水孵育期間溶液中可溶性有機碳含量變化	 48 4 - 3 - 4 、孵育期間土壤溶液硫酸根離子濃度變化情形	 51 4 - 3 - 5 、孵育期間土壤重金屬溶液濃度與型態之變化	 54 第五章、結論	 89 第六章 參考文獻	 9...|$|R
