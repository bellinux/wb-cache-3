5000|$|The floppy {{controller}} {{is unusually}} flexible. It can {{read and write}} raw bit sequences directly from and to the disk via DMA or programmed I/O at 500 (double density) or 250 kbit/s (single density or GCR). MFM or GCR were the two most commonly used formats though in theory any run-length limited code could be used. It also provides a number of convenient features, such as sync-on-word (in MFM coding, $4489 is usually used as the sync word). MFM encoding/decoding is usually done with the blitter — one pass for decode, three passes for encode. Normally the entire track is read or written in one shot, rather than sector-by-sector; this {{made it possible to}} get rid of most of the inter-sector gaps that most floppy disk formats need to safely prevent the [...] "bleeding" [...] of a written sector into the previously-existing header of the next sector due to speed variations of the drive. If all sectors and their headers are always written in one go, such bleeding is only an issue {{at the end of the}} track (which still must not bleed back into its beginning), so that only one gap per track is needed. This way, for the native Amiga disk format, the <b>raw</b> <b>storage</b> capacity of 3.5 inch DD disks was increased from the typical 720 KB to 880 KB, although the less-than-ideal file system of the earlier Amiga models reduced this again to approximately 830 KB of actual payload data.|$|E
30|$|From {{the discussions}} in “Basics of NAND flash memory physics” section, {{it is clear}} that NAND flash memory cell <b>raw</b> <b>storage</b> {{reliability}} gradually degrades with the P/E cycling: During the early lifetime of memory cells (i.e., the P/E cycling number N is relatively small), the aggregated P/E cycling effects are relatively less significant, which leads to a relatively large memory cell storage noise margin and hence good <b>raw</b> <b>storage</b> reliability (i.e., low <b>raw</b> <b>storage</b> bit error rate); since the aggregated P/E cycling effects scale with N in approximate power–law fashions, the memory cell storage noise margin and hence <b>raw</b> <b>storage</b> reliability gradually degrade as the P/E cycling number N increases. As a result, it is sufficient for ECC to provide gradually stronger error correction capability throughout the entire NAND flash memory lifetime.|$|E

40|$|AbstractForensic tools assist analysts with {{recovery}} {{of both the}} data and system events, even from corrupted storage. These tools typically rely on “file carving” techniques to restore files after metadata loss by analyzing the remaining raw file content. A significant amount of sensitive data is stored and processed in relational databases thus creating the need for database forensic tools that will extend file carving solutions to the database realm. <b>Raw</b> database <b>storage</b> is partitioned into individual “pages” that cannot be read or presented to the analyst {{without the help of}} the database itself. Furthermore, by directly accessing <b>raw</b> database <b>storage,</b> we can reveal things that are normally hidden from database users. There exists a number of database-specific tools developed for emergency database recovery, though not usually for forensic analysis of a database. In this paper, we present a universal tool that seamlessly supports many different databases, rebuilding table and other data content from any remaining storage fragments on disk or in memory. We define an approach for automatically (with minimal user intervention) reverse engineering storage in new databases, for detecting volatile data changes and discovering user action artifacts. Finally, we empirically verify our tool's ability to recover both deleted and partially corrupted data directly from the internal storage of different databases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A continuously-observable steganographic {{file system}} allows to {{remotely}} store user files on a <b>raw</b> <b>storage</b> device; the security {{goal is to}} offer plausible deniability even when the <b>raw</b> <b>storage</b> device is continuously monitored by an attacker. Zhou, Pang and Tan have proposed such a system in [7] with a claim of provable security against traffic analysis. In this paper, we disprove their claims by presenting traffic analysis attacks on the file update algorithm of Zhou et al. Our attacks are highly effective in detecting file updates and revealing the existence and location of files. For multi-block files, we show that two updates are sufficient to discover the file. One-block files accessed {{a sufficient number of}} times can also be revealed. Our results suggest that simple randomization techniques are not sufficient to protect steganographic file systems from traffic analysis attacks. ...|$|E
30|$|In this article, {{we present}} a simple design {{technique}} to reduce the latency overhead caused {{by the use of}} LDPC codes. First, we note that NAND flash memory cells gradually wear out with the program/erase (P/E) cycling [4], which is reflected as gradually diminishing memory cell storage noise margin (or increasing <b>raw</b> <b>storage</b> bit error rate). To meet a specified P/E cycling endurance limit, the LDPC code decoding with the maximum allowable soft-decision memory sensing precision should be able to tolerate the worst-case <b>raw</b> <b>storage</b> reliability at the end of memory lifetime. Clearly, the memory cell wear-out dynamics makes the maximally achievable error correction capability of LDPC codes largely more-than-enough over the entire lifetime of memory, especially at its early lifetime when P/E cycling number is relatively small. Meanwhile, the error correction capability of LDPC codes strongly depends on the soft-decision input precision. Therefore, it is very straightforward to apply a progressive-precision LDPC decoding strategy to reduce the average latency, i.e., we always start with the hard-decision memory sensing (and hence hard-decision LDPC code decoding), and only if LDPC decoding fails, we progressively increase the sensing precision and retry the decoding until LDPC decoding succeeds.|$|E

Therefore, stable water bodies that act as refuge habitats will become increasingly important {{to the maintenance of}} freshwater biodiversity. Man-made water bodies such as those associated with water-resource infrastructure could contribute to the available refuge habitat but little is known about fish, zooplankton and frog assemblages in such water bodies. We quantified the diversity and abundance of fish, zooplankton and frogs that reside within <b>raw</b> water <b>storages</b> and water reclamation plants and compared them to assemblages from nearby natural water bodies over a total of 19 water bodies. Overall, the faunal assemblages within the man-made water bodies showed similarities to the nearby natural water bodies with very few differences found among the three water body types. Diversity of available substrates and of submerged and emergent macrophytes were the habitat variables best correlated with diverse faunal assemblages. This study suggests that the faunal assemblages within <b>raw</b> water <b>storages</b> and water reclamation plants resemble those found within nearby natural water bodies and that there is therefore potential for water-resource infrastructure to act as an important refuge habitat during drought. Furthermore, small changes in the management of these storages to maximise habitat diversity could increase the value of the refuge, complementing their role in water-resource delivery...|$|R
