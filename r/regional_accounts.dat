The {{purpose of this}} multiple case {{study was to explore}} strategies <b>regional</b> <b>accounting</b> firm leaders use to train technical staff on soft skills.

Data were collected from semistructured interviews with partners, leaders, managers, and human resource personnel with 5 years or more of experience who participated in the hiring, training, and professional development process at 3 regional CPA firms. The review of company documents and company website postings triangulated the semistructured interviews.

Findings from this study may contribute to social change by providing strategies <b>regional</b> <b>accounting</b> firms could use to provide soft skills training and mentoring initiatives to technical staff.

5000|$|GNI {{is defined}} in {{accordance}} with the European system of national and <b>regional</b> <b>accounts.</b> GNI represents total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (interest, dividends and reinvested earnings from foreign direct investment receivable less payable), gross operating surplus and gross mixed income. It corresponds to the better known gross domestic product (GDP) minus primary income payable by resident units to non-resident units, plus primary income receivable by resident units {{from the rest of the}} world. Technically speaking, the GNI is a balancing item of the allocation of primary income account in the sequence of accounts for the total economy. Loosely speaking, it is the sum of domestic and foreign income earned by the resident population of a country. It is worth noting that GNI is income from productive activities excluding any capital gains and losses (also known as [...] "holding gains and losses") resulting from price changes of fixed or financial assets (for example: price changes on the stock market have no direct impact on GNI).|$|E

40|$|Economic Accounting is {{relatively}} well developed in Norway {{especially on the}} national level, {{but also on the}} <b>regional</b> level. Satellite <b>accounting</b> is used for focusing certain features of the economy, a. o. for tourism. A satellite account for tourism has been developed on the national level. Because the tourists'activities are regional activities, and because the impacts of tourism are significant not only on the national, but also on the regional level, a <b>regional</b> satellite <b>account</b> for tourism was developed by us during the past two years. Such satellite <b>accounts</b> on the <b>regional</b> level are, to our knowledge, not developed worldwide.
