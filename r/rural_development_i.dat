What kind of territorial dynamics are put forward by these new ideas and practices of agriculture production, environmental concern and small-scale agriculture? More specifically, what kind of society - nature relation is intended to be constructed and what does it means in terms of space - power production?

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} from a feminist perspective whether {{women in a}} rural community in Bolivia can use microfinance to negotiate better terms for their citizenship rights. Citizenship frames debates on inclusion and development as Bolivia struggles with the demands ofmarket reform and the imperative to include marginalised citizens. Drawing on participant observation, focus groups and interviews, I consider microfinance as a <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>I</b> strategy and examine whether or not access to credit may provide a 'space for rural Aymaran women to negotiate better terms for their citizenship within a market led development trajectory.

I then held interviews with 25,. women, 12 of whom had also participated in focus group di~cussions.

40|$|The {{agri-food}} sector {{in developing countries}} has been transforming rapidly during the last decades, leading to a more consolidated and vertically integrated agro-industry. Labour market effects are especially pronounced in high-value export sectors. Whether this transformation in the {{agri-food sector}} and the associated employment creation benefits rural households in developing countries remains a highly debated issue. While some argue that {{the economic impact of}} employment is limited due to inferior working conditions, others demonstrate that employment in high-value export sectors can lead to upwards income mobility and poverty reduction but empirical evidence is very scarce. This dissertation aims to fill this research gap by unravelling the links between global food value chains, employment creation and <b>rural</b> <b>development.</b> <b>I</b> focus on the Saint-Louis region in Senegal, a rural area where investments from horticultural export companies have created many off-farm employment opportunities since 2000 s, especially for women. In chapter two I investigate the impact of wage employment on households’ income. I differentiate between employment in the horticultural export industry and employment in other sectors. I use household survey data from two panel rounds in 2006 and 2013 and apply quantile regressions to address unobserved heterogeneity and estimate heterogeneous effects. I demonstrate that employment in the horticultural export sector increases income per capita of the 50 % poorest households with 31 to 57 %, while employment in other sectors increases income per capita of both poor and non-poor households with 82 %. Although employment in other sectors is more remunerative, employment in the horticultural sector is more inclusive, as it employs both poor and non-poor households. In chapter three I analyse the impact of women’s participation in the labour market on fertility rates. Using household- and individual-level survey data I show that employed women have a significantly higher age at marriage and at first childbirth, and significantly fewer children. As causal identification strategy I use instrumental variable and difference-in-differences estimations, combined with propensity score matching. I find that female employment reduces the number of children per woman by 25 %, and that this fertility-reducing effect is as large for poor as for non-poor women and larger for illiterate than for literate women. Results imply that female employment is a strong instrument for empowering rural women, reducing fertility rates and accelerating the demographic transition in poor countries. In chapter four I investigate the impact of female wage employment on women’s subjective wellbeing. I use household- and individual-level survey data and an instrumental variable approach. I find that female employment improves subjective wellbeing for the poorest women but not necessarily for women whose household income has moved well beyond the poverty threshold. Female employment improves women´s happiness through an income effect, as female employment leads to higher income levels and improved living standards, but the non-income effects of female employment reduce women’s happiness. This negative effect is related to a higher workload, low job satisfaction and changing gender roles. In chapter five I analyze contractual preferences of female workers in the horticultural export sector. I use a discrete choice experiment to assess women’s preferences for a labour contract and employ a latent class model to capture preference heterogeneity. I find that women have a high willingness to accept a labour contract in the horticultural export industry and that differences in preferences for contract attributes can be explained by women’s empowerment status. More empowered women prefer flexible, seasonal contracts that include job tasks in the conditioning centres and that provide pick-up service. Less empowered women prefer labour contracts that offer company services, especially health care and training, {{and to a lesser extent}} pick-up service. Overall, this dissertation shows that development of global food value chains can benefit rural households in developing countries through employment creation. Policy implications entail that investments from the horticultural export industry can contribute to a pro-poor economic growth. However, to ensure long-term welfare benefits of employment, working conditions should improve by increasing wages and employment duration. Specific policies on women’s empowerment should take the increase in female wage employment opportunities into account, e. g. through family planning programs that target employed women who have low-fertility preferences. nrpages: 159 status: publishe...|$|E

The interaction between the material and non-material elements affecting rural production and lifestyles shaped different <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> types depending on a carrier, which is composed of different industries.

Then, taking the social representation approach and basing on the major factors affecting the long-term <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> and the exertion of {{the functions of the}} countryside with regard to society, the assessment indicator system of rurality degree index (RDI) was established to distinguish the rurality degree of different types.

40|$|Ms Tsakani Ngomane is Director for Regional Services in the Department of Agriculture, Land and Environment of the Northern Province of South Africa. She sees {{a central}} role for {{agricultural}} home economists {{in the struggle for}} gender equity in her nation's agriculture. Currently vice-chair of CTA's Advisory Committee, she is a clear voice in the 'post-Lomé' debate about relationships between the 71 ACP States and the European Union after the existing Lomé Convention expires early in 2000. As we try to define future co-operation and partnership options for EU and ACP States, we must emphasise the important role that women can play in agriculture. Basically survivors, women are central to the agenda as the primary processors and labourers in a sector still dominated by men. We have to make gender mainstream, and establish gender-sensitive management {{as an integral part of}} agricultural development initiatives. The EU's 'Green Paper' of September 1997 gave several opportunities for change, referring to new instruments and partnerships, and to more active participation by non-governmental players. It embraced several complementary objectives, including combating poverty, promoting sustainable development and the progressive integration of ACP agriculture into the world economy. Whilst urging economic growth through competition and private sector development through regional integration and trade development, the Paper tried to merge economic, environmental and societal interests, while respecting various stages of development of the ACP States ? that is, it sought to differentiate. The response of the ACP Group, in the Libreville Declaration of November 1997, called for greater unity and solidarity, and a focus on three priority areas: growth, competitiveness and employment; social and cultural policies; and regional integration. The guiding principles were institutional support and capacity building; a gender sensitive approach; and sustainable environmental management. This strategic position was reaffirmed in May 1998 by the ACP Committee of Ambassadors, and the ACP NGO Forum. Both emphasised the eradication of poverty, the promotion of gender equity in project cycles, and of women as participants and beneficiaries. One fundamental area where differentiation is not ? or should cease to be ? an issue is women in development. Targets have been set to ensure that gender issues are fully mainstreamed by 2000, but they will not be reached unless deliberate steps are taken to implement the guiding principles of co-operation. Correcting the obvious: targetting women I believe that correcting the obvious gender imbalance is the major entry point for developing social and economic empowerment programmes. Women, especially resource-poor rural women, are important stakeholders. In the agricultural sector alone, their productive roles surpass by far their reproductive role. As invisible actors in development, their contribution to socio-economic development and poverty alleviation is poorly understood and most often deliberately under-estimated. Globally, women produce more than half the food that is grown. In sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, they produce up to 80 % of basic foodstuffs but receive less than 5 % of extension resources. The importance of targeting the real clients in agricultural development whether on primary production, resource conservation, training, technology development, land matters, and access to credit cannot be overemphasized. It's not a power struggle Development institutions need to move away from regarding gender issues as a power struggle between men and women, because that is not the case. The question to ask is who is the primary client, the end-user of services provided? Responding to this question will shape our staffing policies, capacity building programmes, allocation of agricultural resources (land, farm inputs), development of appropriate technologies and extension service delivery strategies. The Post-Lomé debate provides clear guidance and direction for gender mainstreaming. I recognise gender issues as a cross ? cutting phenomenon which should be approached holistically within the larger context of agricultural development in general. However, leading institutions in the sector need to take deliberate steps to involve women at all levels if the target of 2000 is to mean anything real. Let us see more capable women at the policy-making level, more women extension officers and home economists in research stations, training institutions, on the farms in the villages, at the processing plant, the boardroom, yes, at all levels of the agricultural chain. Women: help the men! To the women out there 1, I urge you to reinforce our organisational efforts and assist our male partners in development to implement gender-sensitive management programmes. The agreements between the EU and ACP countries prove their commitment to ensure visibility of the role of women and of the potential to turn the poverty situation of ACP countries around. CTA's mandates in information management are aimed at improving access to technologies for increasing agricultural productivity, commercialisation, food security and rural development, as the Libreville Declaration stated. Central to these mandates is the empowerment of women in agriculture and rural development. We recently decided to strengthen CTA's work in the analysis of specific needs for supporting rural women's organisations, in the emphasis of extension services and in prioritising cooperation with institutions that have specific programmes on the role of women and poverty alleviation in agricultural and <b>rural</b> <b>development.</b> <b>I</b> hope this work addresses the issue of targeting the right client and will serve as an example for ACP national institutions to follow. 1 A recent readership survey showed that more than 90 % of Spore readers are male.

As a woman {{who grew up in the}} rural areas for most of my life, I have witnessed the problems in most of the <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> projects. <b>I</b> have first ‐ hand experience of how the unavailability of these projects has affected the rural communities at large, at the same time, I have witnessed how those who have managed to get some of these projects started have benefitted more ways than one way in these <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> projects. Some of these projects have become a success and some have failed dismally. What contributed to the success or failure of these very important projects needs to be examined. More importantly, the level of community participation needs to be evaluated. Relatively few studies have been conducted to evaluate community participation in <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> projects. Some, if not most of the remote villages in the Eastern Cape Province are still without those basic necessities the government has promised, such as the building of houses and provision of clean water. Another sad story is that not enough is done to educate and empower rural communities about their basic rights and needs. Hence, one of the focal points to the study is to scrutinize the level of participation of the community, as some may be suffering from ignorance, apathy and lack of motivation. to scrutinize their level of participation (community participation).

Application of research results is the first step to modification of rules for the RDP granting aid for the programming period 2014 - 2020 in order to be efficient and targeted at food industry in the new conditions. From a methodological point of view the solution is based on counterfactual analysis and identifies the main effects for the food industry using economic indicators. Results show that the supported businesses consolidated their economic position to a certain extent. The investment support has positive impact on financial stability because participants had smaller decrease of profitability than nonparticipants in the period 2007 - 2010. The investment support increases labour productivity. But due to the higher depreciation, as the consequence of investments in fixed assets, the overall effects on economic results are slightly reduced.
