This pattern was confirmed in Experiment 2 in which words were either read intact or generated from anagrams. These findings show that repeating effortful (but not automatic) encoding operations at test cues not only {{the recognition of the}} information that was acquired via those operations but also the conscious recollection of the encoding episode...|$|R
