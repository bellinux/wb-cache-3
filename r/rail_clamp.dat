5000|$|The Sinar F and F1 {{models have}} a clip-on front {{standard}} (lens standard) {{that does not}} fully enclose the monorail. The advantage is that this standard can easily {{be removed from the}} rail by loosening the clamp and lifting straight up, unlike the rear standard, and it is somewhat lighter weight. The disadvantage of this design is that the rail clamping mechanism is susceptible to breakage if over-tightened. [...] The Sinar F2 and F3 models have a different front standard, which completely encloses the rail and also provides a geared focus adjustment, similar to the rear <b>rail</b> <b>clamp</b> on all Sinar F models. The correct F2 standard can easily be identified as it is a mirror image of the rear standard. The earlier F/F1 front standard has a low-profile metal hinge below the rail.|$|E
40|$|The {{main problem}} of the {{presence}} of high velocity winds that will cause the unloader to move from its position and cause damages to the cargo and the machineryfor grab type ship unloader is solved using a spring loaded hydraulic <b>rail</b> <b>clamp</b> mounted on a rail on which it can move to the ship and unload materials steadily. Data collected from the FACT department about the wind characteristic of the area for a particular period were used and the wind loads acting on the ship unloader is calculated. The maximum wind load that the ship unloader can withstand which has to be the one at which the spring loaded hydraulic clamp will disable is calculated After carefully studying the already existing clamping system, we found that using an alternative spring concentrically, we can increase the wind load capacity which is the maximum load the clamp can withstand. After carefully analyzing different springs we found that with the use of concentric spring, the clamp can withstand a higher amount of wind load, thus increasing the performance of ship unloader. This is proved by spring load calculations and using Autodesk Inventor and ANSYS software...|$|E

40|$|Leakage {{power is}} a growing concern in modern {{technology}} nodes. In some current and emerging applications, speed performance is uncritical but many of these applications rely on untethered power making energy a primary constraint. Leakage power minimisation is therefore key to maximising energy efficiency for these applications. This thesis proposes two new leakage power minimisation techniques to improve the energy efficiency of embedded processors. The first technique, called sub-clock power gating,can be used to reduce leakage power during the active mode. The technique capitalises on the observation that there can be large combinational idle time within the clock period in low performance applications and therefore power gates it. Sub-clock power gating is the first study into the application of power gating within the clock period, and simulation results on post layout netlists using a 90 nm technology library show 3. 5 x, 2 x and 1. 3 x improvement in energy efficiency for three test cases: 16 -bit multiplier, ARM Cortex-M 0 and Event Processor at a given performance point. To reduce the energy cost associated with moving between the sleep and active mode of operation, a second technique called symmetric virtual <b>rail</b> <b>clamping</b> is proposed. Rather than shutting down completely during sleep mode, the proposed technique uses a pair of NMOS and PMOS transistors at the head and foot of the power gated logic to lower the supply voltage by 2 Vth. This reduces the energy needed to recharge the supply rails and eliminates signal glitching energy cost during wake-up. Experimental results from a 65 nm test chip shows application of symmetric virtual <b>rail</b> <b>clamping</b> in sub-clock power gating improves energy efficiency, extending its applicable clock frequency range by 400 x. The physical layout of power gating requires dedicated techniques and this thesis proposes dRail, a new physical layout technique for power gating. Unlike the traditional voltage area approach, dRail allows both power gated and non-power gated cells to be placed together in the physical layout to reduce area and routing overheads. Results from a post layout netlist of an ARM Cortex-M 0 with sub-clock power gating shows standard cell area and signal routing are improved by 3 % and 19 % respectively. Sub-clock power gating, symmetric virtual <b>rail</b> <b>clamping</b> and dRail are incorporated into power gating design flows and are compatible with commercial EDA tools and gate libraries.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique, called subclock power gating, for reducing leakage power during the active mode in low performance, energy-constrained applications. The proposed technique achieves power reduction through two mechanisms: 1) power gating the combinational logic within the clock period (subclock) and 2) reducing the virtual supply {{to less than}} Vth rather than shutting down completely {{as is the case}} in conventional power gating. To achieve this reduced voltage, a pair of nMOS and pMOS transistors are used at the head and foot of the power gated logic for symmetric virtual <b>rail</b> <b>clamping</b> of the power and ground supplies. The subclock power gating technique has been validated by incorporating it with an ARM Cortex-M 0 microprocessor, which was fabricated in a 65 -nm process. Two sets of experiments are done: the first experimentally validates the functionality of the proposed technique in the fabricated test chip and the second investigates the utility of the proposed technique in example applications. Measured results from the fabricated chip show 27 % power saving during the active mode for an example wireless sensor node application when compared with the same microprocessor without subclock power gating...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Energy {{dissipation}} {{is becoming}} more and more important in today's microprocessor design. As on-die cache becomes so popular today and tends to occupy a good portion of the whole die area, energy dissipation from cache presents a significant part. Supply voltage and the transistor threshold voltage continuously scale down to achieve high transistor switching speed. A lower threshold voltage significantly increases the leakage energy dissipation due to the exponential increase of leakage current. This energy leakage exists even when the transistor is not switching. Recently reduction of leakage energy in processors begins to draw attention. In our project an associativity adaptive L 1 data cache (D-cache) is proposed to reduce the leakage energy. The idea comes from the observation that the cache utilization varies both within and across programs while most caches have a fix size leading to leakage inefficiency. By dynamically resizing the cache, a performance and leakage energy saving tradeoff can be achieved. The resize of the cache is realized by enable/disable cache ways of a set associative cache based on the performance of the cache and it is all done by hardware. At circuit level, we propose to use Virtual Power/Ground <b>Rails</b> <b>Clamp.</b> Simulation results indicate that the associativity adaptive L 1 D-cache successfully exploits the cache size variability and achieves a good performance/leakage energy tradeoff...|$|R
50|$|Tensioned {{screen cloth}} is {{typically}} 4 feet by the width or {{the length of}} the screening machine depending on whether the deck is side or end tensioned. Screen cloth for tensioned decks can be made with hooks and are attached with <b>clamp</b> <b>rails</b> bolted {{on both sides of the}} screen box. When the <b>clamp</b> <b>rail</b> bolts are tightened, the cloth is tensioned or even stretched in the case of some types of self-cleaning screen media. To ensure that the center of the cloth does not tap repeatedly on the deck due to the vibrating shaker and that the cloth stays tensioned, support bars are positioned at different heights on the deck to create a crown curve from hook to hook on the cloth. Tensioned screen cloth is available in various materials: stainless steel, high carbon steel and oil tempered steel wires, as well as moulded rubber or polyurethane and hybrid screens (a self-cleaning screen cloth made of rubber or polyurethane and metal wires).|$|R
40|$|Background: Laparoscopy is a {{well-established}} alternative to open surgery for treating many diseases. Although laparoscopy has many advantages, {{it is also}} associated with disadvantages, such as slow learning curves and prolonged operation time. Fresh frozen cadavers may be an interesting resource for laparoscopic training, and many institutions have access to cadavers. One of the main obstacles for the use of cadavers as a training model is the difficulty in introducing a sufficient pneumoperitoneum to distend the abdominal wall and provide a proper working space. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe a fresh human cadaver model for laparoscopic training without requiring a pneumoperitoneum. Materials and Methods and Results: A fake abdominal wall device was developed to allow for laparoscopic training without requiring a pneumoperitoneum in cadavers. The device consists of a table-mounted retractor, two <b>rail</b> <b>clamps,</b> two independent frame arms, two adjustable handle and rotating features, and two frames of the abdominal wall. A handycam is fixed over a frame arm, positioned and connected through a USB connection to a television and dissector; scissors and other laparoscopic materials are positioned inside trocars. The laparoscopic procedure is thus simulated. Conclusion: Cadavers offer a very promising and useful model for laparoscopic training. We developed a fake abdominal wall device that solves the limitation of space when performing surgery on cadavers and removes the need to acquire more costly laparoscopic equipment. This model is easily accessible at institutions in developing countries, making it one of the most promising tools for teaching laparoscopy...|$|R

40|$|The catastrophic {{derailment}} of a {{gantry crane}} is analysed in the paper. Under {{the action of}} a persistent and very strong wind, with gusts at about 110 km/h, the crane started moving and, after having travelled for about 60 m, derailed and collapsed. Fortunately, no injured operator resulted from the event. The crane was endowed with passive <b>rail</b> <b>clamps,</b> {{which had to be}} dimensioned with reference to a very strong, i. e. out-of-service, wind intensity, given in standards. The analysis of technical data of the crane and of the installed clamps brought to the conclusion that a trivial error was made in the determination of the out-of-service wind load, since no aerodynamic coefficient was taken into account in the evaluation of the wind thrust. Due to this, the clamps didn't respond to the current regulations and, actually, were not capable of keeping the crane standing for the strongest wind load, which may occur in the region of the plant installation. The analysis, based on crane geometry and wind recordings, shows that, actually, the clamps capacity was exceeded by the wind load at the moment of the accident. A plane analysis of the crane loading condition, based on a beam model, allowed to explain the way the crane collapsed, with the rotation about a vertical axis of one of the leg, and to estimate the loads exchanged between the crane bogies and the rail, that caused the rupture of several rail anchoring bolts. The accident was caused by a design error and this points out the necessity of accurate evaluations, with multiple and independent checks, in particular in case of large plants with significant risk for operators, as in this case, or for the environment...|$|R

40|$|The WRIST project (Innovative Welding Processes for New Rail Infrastructure) aims {{to develop}} and present new methods for joining rails. One of the methods {{proposed}} is Orbital Friction Welding (OFW) of rails using an intermediate disk. The process is still in development and numerical simulations can provide useful insight and guidance on how to further develop this welding process. This thesis presents 3 D thermo-mechanical modeling of OFW for pearlitic rails and 2 D axisymmetric modeling of rotary friction welding of thin-walled pipes. Process parameters and sensitivity to material parameters have been studied for both welding methods. From the simulations, it is shown that correct modeling of the generated heat, during the frictional motion, is of high importance. Therefore, this report also presents a model framework {{which can be used}} for calibrating a heat generation model based on experimental data. This framework is based on the developed 2 D axisymmetric model and has been evaluated using several heat generation models. A model based on a piecewise linear variation for the coefficient of friction with respect to temperature is deemed as the most promising of the considered models. Thermal simulations of OFW for rails have been performed to evaluate the temperature field in the rail and the intermediate disk. Results shows that machine components such as <b>rail</b> <b>clamps</b> have little effect on the resulting temperature field as well as cooling rates. Furthermore, it is shown that a longer heating phase is more likely to result in a pearlitic microstructure in the heat affected zone and is, therefore, preferable. Mechanical simulations of friction welding leads to severe mesh distortions and consequently numerical issues. The results presented are therefore somewhat limited. However, two methods for overcoming this problem has been identified: remeshing during simulation and introduction of visco-plastic material behavior. Both methods are suggested for further study. Finally, models for yield strength at high temperatures are presented and discussed, a material parameter identified as crucial for accurate simulation of the welding process.

In 1972 the three guns were converted back to static coastal guns and installed on Glosholma fort of the Suomenlinna Coastal Artillery Regiment.

30|$|Supine position: Placement of a monolateral fixator (LRS system, Orthofix®, Verona, Italy) with screws in the femur and tibia and an {{intervening}} hinge positioned so as {{to coincide}} with the instantaneous centre of rotation for the knee. Two compressor–distractor devices, the first one medium-sized and in the dorsal position, and a second, large and in the volar position, were spanned across the hinge by anchoring to the proximal and distal <b>rails</b> on special <b>clamps</b> (Figs.  1, 2). Placement of the external fixator was performed with fluoroscopic control. A 1.5  mm K-wire was inserted through the central orifice of the fixator’s rotation hinge {{to coincide with the}} centre of rotation of the knee which, according to anatomical and biomechanical studies [25, 26, 27, 28, 29], is located at the intersection of the posterior femoral cortex and the intercondylar notch, and in the frontal plane passes through the origins of the medial collateral and lateral collateral ligaments (Fig.  3). After situating this rotation centre, both the proximal femoral and distal tibial rails were each fixed using two threaded half-pins through clamps (Fig.  4). The accuracy of our efforts was verified in vitro using the concentric circles method [27, 28, 30, 31]. Our calculations revealed that a 1  mm distraction of the posterior compressor–distractor device produces 1 – 2 ° gradual knee extension. The estimate of the average correction period was 15.7  days. The fixator hinge was locked at − 30 ° in the immediate postoperative period and up to 4 – 5  mm of distraction was applied to the anterior compressor–distractor device at a rate of 1  mm/day. This was done after unlocking the tibial clamp on the tibial rail, thereby minimizing any potential crushing of the articular cartilage during the subsequent angular correction. When this distraction was accomplished, the tibial clamp was locked and distraction now applied to the posterior unit (at 1  mm/ 8  h), with the femoral <b>clamp</b> on the <b>rail</b> and hinge unlocked, until complete extension of the knee was achieved. This usually occurred after a 14 – 18  days period. The fixator and the half pins were removed as an outpatient procedure within a 4 – 8  week period after surgery. No cast immobilization of the knee was used. The rehabilitation process was initiated immediately after removal of the fixator. We used nocturnal postural orthoses for a period of 2 – 3  months.|$|R
40|$|Electrostatic {{discharge}} (ESD) is {{a well-known}} contributor that reduces the reliability and yield of the integrated circuits (ICs). As ICs become more complex, they are increasingly susceptible to such failures due to the scaling of physical dimensions of devices and interconnect on a chip [1]. These failures are caused by excessive electric field and/or excessive current densities and result in the dielectric breakdown, electromigration of metal lines and contacts. ESD can affect the IC in its different life stages, from wafer fabrication process to failure in the field. Furthermore, ESD events can damage the integrated circuit permanently (hard failure), or cause a latent damage (soft failure) [2]. ESD protection circuits consisting of I/O protection and ESD power supply clamps are routinely used in ICs to protect them against ESD damage. The main objective of the ESD protection circuit {{is to provide a}} low-resistive discharge path between any two pins of the chip to harmlessly discharge ESD energy without damaging the sensitive circuits. The main target of this thesis is to design ESD power supply clamps that have the lowest possible leakage current without degrading the ESD protection ability in general purpose TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology. ESD clamps should have a very low-leakage current and should be stable and immune to the power supply noise under the normal operating conditions of the circuit core. Also, the ESD clamps must be able to handle high currents under an ESD event. All designs published in the general purpose 65 nm CMOS technology have used the SCR as the clamping element since the SCR has a higher current carrying capability compared to an MOS transistor of the same area [3]. The ESD power supply clamp should provide a low-resistive path in both directions to {{be able to deal with}} both PSD and NDS zapping modes. The SCR based design does not provide the best ESD protection for the NDS zapping mode (positive ESD stress at VSS with grounded VDD node) since it has two parasitic resistances (RNwell and RPsub) and one parasitic diode (the collector to base junction diode of the PNP transistor) in the path from the VSS to VDD. Furthermore, SCR-based designs are not suitable for application that exposed to hot switching or ionizing radiation [2]. In GP process, the gate oxide thickness of core transistors is reduced compared with LP process counterpart to achieve higher performance designs for high-frequency applications using 1 V core transistors and 2. 5 V I/O option. The thinner gate oxide layer results in higher leakage current due to gate tunneling [4]. Therefore, using large thin oxide MOS transistors as clamping elements will result in a huge leakage. In this thesis, four power supply ESD clamps are proposed in which thick oxide MOS transistors are used as the main clamping element. Therefore, the low-leakage current feature is achieved without significantly degrading the ESD performance. In addition, the parasitic diode of the MOS transistors provides the protection against NSD-mode. In this thesis, two different ESD power supply clamp architectures are proposed: standalone ESD power supply clamps and hybrid ESD power supply clamps. Two standalone clamps are proposed: a transient PMOS based ESD clamp with thyristor delay element (PTC), and a static diode triggered power supply (DTC). The standalone clamps were designed to protect the circuit core against ± 125 V CDM stress by limiting the voltage between the two power rails to less than the oxide breakdown voltage of the core transistors, BVOXESD = 5 V. The large area of this architecture was the price for maintaining the low-leakage current and an adequate ESD protection. The hybrid clamp architecture was proposed to provide a higher ESD protection, against ± 300 V CDM stress, while reducing the layout area and maintaining the low-leakage feature. In the hybrid clamp structure, two clamps are connected in parallel between the two power supply <b>rails,</b> a static <b>clamp,</b> and a transient clamp. The static clamp triggers first and starts to sink the ESD energy and then an RC network triggers the primary transient clamp to sink most of the ESD stress. Two hybrid designs were proposed: PMOS ESD power supply clamp with thyristor delay element and diodes (PTDC), and NMOS ESD power supply clamp with level shifter delay element and diode (NLDC). Simulation results show that the proposed clamps are capable of protecting the circuit core against ± 1. 5 kV HBM and at least against ± 125 V CDM stresses. The measurement results show that all of the proposed clamps are immune against false triggering, and transient induced latch-up. Furthermore, all four designs have responded favorably to the 4 V ESD-like pulse voltage under both chip powered and not powered conditions and after the stress ends the designs turned off. Finally, TLP measurement results show that all four proposed designs meet the minimum design requirement of the ESD protection circuit in the 65 nm CMOS technology (i. e. HBM protection level of ± 1. 5 kV) ...|$|R
