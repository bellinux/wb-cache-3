5|$|He {{converted}} from a starting pitcher to a reliever in 2009, {{along with several}} other Phillies pitching prospects. Around that time, he also, {{at the suggestion of}} the same minor league pitching coaches who converted him to relief, lowered his <b>release</b> <b>point</b> to his current low angle. Success did not manifest itself immediately, as he still posted a 4.04 ERA in 2009, his first season in relief, but in 2010, he cut his ERA to 2.91 while splitting time between Lakewood and the Clearwater Threshers, the Phillies High-A affiliate. At the end of the 2010 season, he played for the Mesa Solar Sox in the Arizona Fall League. He spent the 2011 season with the Double-A Reading Phillies, accruing a 0–1 record and a 3.05 ERA and 3 saves in 53 games. Thereafter, the Phillies added him to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.|$|E
25|$|During the off-season, Marquis tweaked his {{delivery}} {{to improve his}} <b>release</b> <b>point</b> by staying over the rubber longer in his balance point, allowing his arm to catch up, resulting in a 2 to 3inches longer stride, and leaving him {{on top of the}} ball and throwing downhill. Reporters attributed his first-half success to his new delivery and his high ground ball ratio.|$|E

25|$|Okajima's pitches are {{of lower}} than average velocity, {{forcing him to}} develop a more {{consistent}} <b>release</b> <b>point</b> to better control them. His fastball is usually in the 85–89mph range, rarely ever reaching 90mph. His out pitch in Japan was his sharp rainbow curveball in the 70–75mph range, which left-handed hitters find hard to hit. He also occasionally throws a circle changeup, a forkball in the 80–84mph range and changeup usually 82–84mph.|$|E
25|$|For fast bowlers at {{the point}} of release the back of hand will be facing in the {{opposite}} direction of the batsmen facing the pending delivery. The front of the upright wrist and tips of the index and middle fingers all point to the target. For spin bowlers the wrist may well be at various angles at <b>release</b> <b>point.</b> This is because one is trying to create drag on a particular side of the ball, not propel it straight as per the section above.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>point</b> <b>release,</b> {{the changes}} to the {{software}} project are typically minor, usually reserved for bug fixes, optimizations, security patches, or to add minor new features. Typically, bugs that affect the broad user population are picked for a <b>point</b> <b>release.</b> Depending on the organization, the size and breadth of a <b>point</b> <b>release</b> can range anywhere from a fix targeted release for a single customer to a general maintenance release or even a service pack. <b>Point</b> <b>releases</b> typically try to be interface-compatible with the previous major release of the software. Also, a <b>point</b> <b>release</b> tends to be compatible with all other <b>point</b> <b>releases</b> under the current minor or major version.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of a long-term support period, the software developers impose a feature freeze: They make patches to correct software bugs and vulnerabilities, but do not introduce new features that may cause regression. The software maintainer either distributes patches individually, or packages them in maintenance <b>releases,</b> <b>point</b> <b>releases,</b> or service packs. At the conclusion of the support period, the product reaches end-of-life.|$|R
25|$|As {{the game}} progressed towards {{professionals}} and became more serious, pitchers began {{to attempt to}} prevent the batter from hitting the ball by throwing faster pitches. With {{the introduction of the}} called strike in , catchers began inching closer to home plate due to the rules requirement that a strikeout could only be completed by a catch. The rules governing the delivery of pitches proved to be hard to enforce, and pitchers continued to stretch the boundaries of the rules until the 1870s when the <b>release</b> <b>point</b> of pitches had reached the pitcher's waist level.|$|E
25|$|One-loft {{racing is}} the process of {{training}} birds bred by many different breeders in the same loft, under the same trainer and in the same conditions (as opposed to trainer against trainer in their own lofts and usually with their own birds). It is thought to be the fairest method of proving which bloodline or breeder is best and usually provides the highest amount of prize money. Pigeons are recorded by electronic timing systems scanning the birds as they enter the home loft with winners decided by as little as 100th of a second. The birds are all taken to the same <b>release</b> <b>point</b> and they return to the same home loft, so therefore it is the fastest bird to complete the journey from A to B. One-loft racing is now becoming very popular all around the world with fanciers able to compare their bloodlines on an equal basis against the many other pigeons.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity in aerial combat, at grave risk of {{his life}} {{above and beyond the}} call of duty, as section leader and pilot of Fighting Squadron 3 on February 20, 1942. Having lost the assistance of his teammates, Lieutenant O'Hare interposed his fighter between his ship and an advancing enemy formation of 9 attacking twin-engine heavy bombers. Without hesitation, alone and unaided, he repeatedly attacked this enemy formation, at close range in the face of intense combined machine gun and cannon fire. Despite this concentrated opposition, Lieutenant O'Hare, by his gallant and courageous action, his extremely skillful marksmanship in making the most of every shot of his limited amount of ammunition, shot down 5 enemy bombers and severely damaged a sixth before they reached the bomb <b>release</b> <b>point.</b> As a result of his gallant action—one of the most daring, if not the most daring, single action in the history of combat aviation—he undoubtedly saved his carrier from serious damage.|$|E

500|$|McCoy {{injured his}} {{throwing}} {{arm in the}} BCS title game against Alabama with a pinched nerve. He announced he would not attend the NFL Combine and instead performed during the University of Texas pro workout day. Opinions over McCoy's potential in the NFL were mixed. Frank Cooney of USA Today noted that McCoy [...] "fired mostly from a shotgun, has a low <b>release</b> <b>point</b> and might lack an NFL fastball." [...] He was listed by Cooney as the 3rd best QB draft choice in 2010, behind Sam Bradford and Jimmy Clausen.|$|E

500|$|Rivera's cut fastball was a {{respected}} pitch among major league hitters. Jim Thome called it [...] "the single best pitch {{ever in the}} game". David Ortiz echoed his sentiment, saying, [...] "His cutter was the single best pitch I've ever seen, but the really amazing thing is how {{he was able to}} do it for so many years. Are there guys now who have stuff as nasty as Mariano? Maybe for one year, two years. But nobody could maintain it like he did." [...] In 2004, ESPN.com ranked his cutter as the best [...] "out pitch" [...] in baseball. Olney described his cut fastball as [...] "the most dominant pitch of a generation". Although switch-hitters usually bat left-handed against right-handed pitchers to better see the ball's <b>release</b> <b>point,</b> switch-hitters occasionally batted right-handed when facing the right-handed Rivera to avoid being jammed on their hands by his cutter. Similarly, some managers, such as Bruce Bochy in the 1998 World Series, sent right-handed batters to pinch hit for left-handers [...] against Rivera, thinking that the cutter would be more difficult for lefties to hit. Opposing hitters occasionally chose to face Rivera with backup or batting practice bats, rather than risk their best bats being broken by his cutter.|$|E
500|$|After one-hitting Boston on May 2, 1904, Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Rube Waddell taunted Young to {{face him}} {{so that he could}} repeat his {{performance}} against Boston's ace. Three days later, Young pitched a perfect game against Waddell and the Athletics. It was the first perfect game in American League history. Waddell was the 27th and last batter, and when he flied out, Young shouted, [...] "How do you like that, you hayseed?" [...] Waddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge. Young's perfect game was the centerpiece of a pitching streak. Young set major league records for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched and the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit; the latter record still stands at 25.1 innings, or 76 hitless batters. Even after allowing a hit, Young's scoreless streak reached a then-record 45 shutout innings. Before Young, only two pitchers had thrown perfect games. This occurred in 1880, when Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward pitched perfect games within five days of each other, although under somewhat different rules: the front edge of the pitcher's box was only [...] from home base (the modern <b>release</b> <b>point</b> is about [...] farther away); walks required eight balls; and pitchers were obliged to throw side-armed. Young's perfect game was the first under the modern rules established in 1893. One year later, on July 4, 1905, Rube Waddell beat Young and the Americans, 42, in a 20-inning matchup. Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave up a pair of unearned runs in the final inning. Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted: [...] "For my part, I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in." [...] In 1907, Young and Waddell faced off in a scoreless 13-inning tie.|$|E
2500|$|In cricket, the striker's end stumps and {{the bowling}} crease are [...] apart. The popping creases are [...] {{in front of}} the stumps and thus are [...] apart. The bowler's <b>release</b> <b>point</b> could be perhaps [...] beyond his popping crease (both {{positions}} change every over). The batsman tends to [...] "take guard" [...] or [...] "block" [...] on the popping crease, i.e. he stands [...] in front of his stumps. That nets to a typical distance of about [...] between delivery point and bat. In baseball, the pitcher's <b>release</b> <b>point</b> could be about [...] depending on his delivery style, but the batter also tends to stand back or [...] "deep" [...] in the batter's box, to maximise his time to [...] "look the ball over", up to [...] further from the pitching rubber than the point of home plate is. Thus the horizontal distance, from release of the ball by the pitcher/bowler to its arrival at the batter/batsman, is similar in both sports. However, the ball usually travels further in cricket as it normally bounces off the ground first, adding a significant vertical component to the total distance travelled.|$|E

2500|$|Most closers {{depend on}} one pitch that becomes synonymous with their success: Trevor Hoffman's changeup, Mariano Rivera's cut fastball.

The fastball is straight gas ... but the changeup is a devious thing, a bowling ball rolled off a picnic table.
