25|$|Despite {{a mediocre}} 35–37 {{record for the}} 1958–59 season the Nationals would make the playoffs again by {{finishing}} in 3rd place. In the playoffs the Nationals would once again <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasion</b> sweeping the New York Knickerbockers in 2 straight to reach the Eastern Finals, where they gave the eventual champion Boston Celtics all they could handle, alternating wins before falling by 5 points in Game 7.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Childress {{promoted}} 25-year-old Busch Series driver Johnny Sauter to the ride, {{hoping he}} would <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasion</b> like Harvick had in 2001. Kevin Hamlin moved over from the 31 team to serve as Sauter's crew chief. Sauter had helped secure the 2003 Busch Series owner's championship in a partial schedule with RCR, while finishing 8th in driver points. Sauter failed to score a top ten, ranked {{at the bottom of}} the Raybestos Rookie standings, and was released just 13 races into the season. After that, Dave Blaney drove the car, only skipping Infineon Raceway when Jim Inglebright took the wheel. A couple of weeks after it was announced Blaney would be in the car for rest of the year, Jeff Burton became available after parting ways with Roush Racing's No. 99 car, leaving Blaney out in the cold. Burton was signed to a multi-year contract and drove the car for the rest of the year beginning at Michigan in August. When Robby Gordon left to start his own team, Burton moved to the 31.|$|E

500|$|On March 21, 2005, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman, co-stars of The Ring Two (2005), {{were cast}} as Wendy Christensen and Kevin Fischer. Winstead, who had auditioned {{for the second}} Final Destination film, won the role because her {{portrayal}} of the character's emotion impressed Wong and Morgan. Wong {{said that he had}} originally intended for Wendy to be a [...] "perky blonde" [...] and reworked the character slightly after Winstead was cast; he believed the actors were right for their roles. On Winstead, he said that [...] " [...] a kind of soulfulness to her role as Wendy" [...] and her character [...] "is deeply affected by the accident, but she's strong, and fights to maintain control". On Merriman, he said that [...] "the moment [...] came in I thought he was the right guy to play Kevin" [...] and described the character as [...] "the kind of guy you want to hang out with, your goofy best buddy, but also someone who could <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasion</b> and become a hero".|$|E
2500|$|... "Nigeria {{has once}} again failed to <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasion....</b> Size isn't enough....

2500|$|Ironically, the Red Guard {{actually}} {{broke into}} the palace through a back door that was left open, guarded by wounded and disabled reserves. This gave <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasion</b> being described as {{the birth of the}} Soviet state. Nikolai Podvoisky, one of the original troika, which led the original storming, was so impressed by the re-enactment that he commissioned Sergei Eisenstein to make his film [...] Certain features, such as the banks of floodlights which appear in Eisenstein's film indicate that Eisenstein was more influenced by the re-enactment than the original event.|$|E

2500|$|Prince Charles: A very spoiled Welsh Corgi {{owned by}} Aunt Dolly. Has a higher view on life from {{listening}} to Aunt Dolly and living indoors. Often there are [...] "class" [...] clashes between him and Dog. He sometimes lusts after Jess but is even more fond of fine canine cuisine. In Book 12, he is asked to [...] "service" [...] a female corgi named Penelope Penrose IV, but fails to <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasion,</b> leaving Major to the job at night. The Dog usually has to explain to Prince Charles the rougher aspects of farm life [...] like livestock mating and maggots eating mutton without gravy. He is territorial when on his own turf. First appearance: Book 4 (April 1981).|$|E
2500|$|Bakunin had a {{different}} view as compared to Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the lumpenproletariat and the proletariat. As such [...] "Both agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained {{the possibility that the}} peasants and even the lumpenproletariat (-proletarians in rags- the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasion.</b> Bakunin [...] "considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form—the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work...in short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "What I did say {{was that}} such a thought of {{improving}} the situation of Israel in Eretz Israel would be worthwhile if we would <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasion.</b> It would require return to G-d by observing and honoring the Torah, and a consensus that the foundation of all must be the power of Torah. Repenting of baseless hatred, and wholehearted peace-seeking as obligated [...] would result in success {{because it would be}} close to G-d’s will. We must make amends toward the future that the power of the sanctity of Torah {{be at the top of}} our list of priorities, that 'the son of Yishai be at the lead.' If the will to improve materially will rest on Torah – then the Lord will shine His face upon us and crown our every deed with success. At first, the salvation will be gradual, as our holy Rabbis remarked upon witnessing daybreak over the valley of Arbel, but after it will gain momentum, appearing as a great and wondrous light, as in the days of our exodus from Egypt.|$|E

2500|$|The siege also {{reflected}} credit on Tang Jingsong's generalship {{and the professional}} skills of the Yunnan Army. [...] The Yunnan Army contained {{a large number of}} officers and men who had learned the art of siege warfare under Marshal Ma Rulong (Ma Ju-lung, 馬如龍), who crushed a Moslem insurrection in Yunnan in the early 1870s. [...] Captain Jean-François-Alphonse Lecomte, one of the more discerning officers of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, paid tribute to the skill the Yunnan Army had shown in its siegecraft at Tuyen Quang:The mandarins had directed the attack on Tuyen Quang in a very intelligent manner. [...] Owing to the Moslem insurrection in Yunnan, an insurrection that had nearly engulfed the entire province and was only put down by Marshal Ma after several sieges, they were now experts in the art of siegecraft. [...] Their troops were excellent, and although they were unable to capture the fortress, defended as it was by a handful of heroes and relieved in the very nick of time by Giovanninelli’s brigade, this siege was nonetheless a glorious feat of arms for the Celestials and showed that when necessary they could <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasion.</b>|$|E

60|$|He motioned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fatal bottle, {{which still}} {{stood on the}} table; the steward caught his breath, and then, <b>rising</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasion,</b> {{said that he had}} already had a couple of glasses, and they had done no good.|$|R
6000|$|Bill {{seemed to}} {{recognise}} that his comrade had <b>risen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasion.</b> [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I s'pose there's no use in me sayin' anything. All I {{want to know}} is, how you're going to do it?" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the end he}} did prepare breakfast {{though in}} a distrait fashion; indeed I found him {{beginning}} to make tea in the frying-pan. Bastin felt that his opportunity had arrived, and was making ready to <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasion.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{exploitation}} of immigrant {{labor and the}} struggle against seemingly impossible odds are complimentary as themes in the story.

60|$|The old gentleman {{staggered}} for a moment, {{and caught}} at the mantelpiece, for the blow {{was a heavy}} one, and as unexpected as it was heavy.

60|$|Here {{you have}} the man at his Burgoynest.

50|$|When Raymond Ceulemans, {{the reigning}} champion, opted not <b>to</b> {{participate}} in <b>the</b> world championship in 1981 over some circumstances, Dielis {{was selected as}} a temporary replacement. <b>Rising</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasion,</b> he won <b>the</b> title besting Nobuaki Kobayashi.
