5|$|The American League's closers then {{entered the}} game, with Jonathan Papelbon {{pitching}} a scoreless {{bottom of the}} eighth. In the ninth, J.J. Putz tried to earn the save and began by inducing a weak pop-up and striking out Brian McCann. Pinch-hitter Dmitri Young <b>rolled</b> <b>a</b> ground ball deep in the hole to Brian Roberts, {{but he could not}} come up with it. Alfonso Soriano followed with a two-run home run to right field to cut the NL's deficit to one. After Putz walked J. J. Hardy, AL manager Jim Leyland replaced him with Francisco Rodríguez. However, Rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his pitches and walked Derrek Lee on a check-swing 3–2 pitch and then Orlando Hudson to load the bases. In a move that drew criticism, La Russa elected not to pinch-hit his last player on the bench, Albert Pujols, and instead let Aaron Rowand hit. Rowand lofted a fly ball to right field that was caught by Alex Ríos to close the game, earning the American League their tenth consecutive victory.|$|E

Black <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> four and a five; since no queen move is possible, he must play the only legal rook move, 2...Rb8. White <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> three and a six, and plays 3.Bxf7+. Black <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> two and a four; since no knight or rook move is a legal response to the check, he must pass. (Only a six, or doubles, would have allowed him to move.) White <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> two and a four, and chooses 4.Nh3. (A three or five would have enabled an immediate win with 4.Bxe8, 4.Qf3# or 4.Qh5#). Black <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> one and a three; again, this does not allow a legal response to the check, so he must pass. White <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> two and a four, and plays 5.Ng5#.

500|$|Anastasia's daring {{occasionally}} {{exceeded the}} limits of acceptable behavior. [...] "She undoubtedly held the record for punishable deeds in her family, for in naughtiness she was a true genius", said Gleb Botkin, son of the court physician Yevgeny Botkin, who later died with the family at Yekaterinburg. Anastasia sometimes tripped the servants and played pranks on her tutors. As a child, she would climb trees and refuse to come down. Once, during a snowball fight at the family's Polish estate, Anastasia <b>rolled</b> <b>a</b> rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister Tatiana, knocking her to the ground. A distant cousin, Princess Nina Georgievna, recalled that [...] "Anastasia was nasty {{to the point of}} being evil", and would cheat, kick and scratch her playmates during games; she was affronted because the younger Nina was taller than she was. She was less concerned about her appearance than her sisters. Hallie Erminie Rives, a best-selling American author and wife of an American diplomat, described how 10-year-old Anastasia ate chocolates without bothering to remove her long, white opera gloves at the St. Petersburg opera house.|$|E
500|$|Very {{high-end}} EF4 {{damage was}} again observed near {{the intersection of}} Illinois Route 64 and Illinois Route 251, where a row of five homes was completely leveled, two of which were swept away. One of the homes that was swept away was anchor-bolted, though the foundation was of cinder-block construction. Intense ground scouring was evident nearby, a car was thrown a full mile, and debris was wind-rowed long distances through fields in this area. Winds were again estimated at around 200mph (320km/h), with the damage at this location again being near-EF5 in intensity. Further to the northeast, the tornado inflicted high-end EF4 damage as a large farmstead was completely destroyed. A well-constructed barn was completely obliterated, and a [...] reinforced concrete silo {{was reduced to a}} pile of rubble. A large farmhouse on the property was completely swept away, and nearby trees were severely stripped and debarked. The tornado weakened as it crossed North Moore Road, where a warehouse building had a collapse of its non-bearing exterior walls. One small barn or outbuilding had a collapse of exterior walls while another had a few metal roof panels ripped off. After crossing Interstate 39, it caused moderate roof damage to a large residence and tossed and <b>rolled</b> <b>a</b> heavy barn. The tornado continued to produce generally EF1 damage to trees and outbuildings before exiting Ogle County, and it was briefly accompanied by an EF0 satellite tornado that damaged crops to its southeast.|$|E

500|$|After Reading were promoted, Waller {{met with}} the players on 4 June 1976 to discuss their {{contracts}} for the 1976–77 season. The wages offered to the Reading players were far lower {{than they had been}} expecting, causing the team's morale to fall drastically. [...] "We got screwed by the club", midfielder Eamon Dunphy later claimed. [...] "We didn't get what we had been promised." [...] Friday was so offended by the low salary offered that he handed in a transfer request, telling the Evening Post that the club's directors clearly did not share his ambition. [...] "They would be happy to stroll along in {{the bottom half of the}} Third Division forever", he said. The row over the new contracts continued throughout the off-season, while Friday planned his second wedding; he had been formally divorced from Maxine after years of separation, and subsequently engaged to Liza Deimel, a Reading-born university graduate. After the pay dispute was settled on 5 August, the couple were married in Reading three days later. The wedding was filmed by Southern Television, before whose cameras Friday, wearing an open-necked tiger-skin-pattern shirt, brown velvet suit and snakeskin boots, sat on the steps of the church and <b>rolled</b> <b>a</b> joint. Friday had invited about two hundred people, mostly friends and relatives from London, who joined in the drinking and drug-taking and ending up fighting each other and stealing the couple's wedding presents, one of which was a large quantity of cannabis. Liza later called the wedding [...] "the most hilarious thing ever". [...] "I have been to a few weddings", recalled Rod Lewington, [...] "but never one like that." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{counter to}} a break is often <b>a</b> {{displacement}} <b>roll</b> called <b>a</b> barrel <b>roll</b> attack. <b>A</b> barrel <b>roll</b> consists of performing <b>a</b> <b>roll</b> and <b>a</b> loop, completing {{both at the same}} time. The result is <b>a</b> helical <b>roll</b> around <b>a</b> straight flight path. The barrel <b>roll</b> attack uses <b>a</b> much tighter loop than the <b>roll,</b> completing <b>a</b> full loop while only executing 3/4 of <b>a</b> <b>roll.</b> The result is a virtual 90 degree turn, using all three dimensions, in the direction opposite of the roll.

5000|$|Critical Failures: In {{the first}} film, a {{critical}} plot point occurs when <b>a</b> player <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> Natural 20, {{which calls for}} an automatic success. In Dorkness Rising, two comedic occasions are based around players rolling a Natural 1, in which the character automatically fails an action. Cass tries to <b>roll</b> <b>a</b> 20 to save himself from the Death Demon and instead <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> one, causing his character to be completely compelled to serve the demon (to {{the point that the}} DM directly controls him). When Flynn tries to back-stab Mort Kemnon's grimoire, he <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> one and instead stabs himself. In both cases, the actions that failed were not required to be rolled by the game leader. However, the players demanded to roll to get unlikely good results, resulting in fatal mistakes.|$|R
2500|$|There are 15 consonants in the Kinaray-a language. They are Bb, Kk, Dd, Gg, Hh, Ll, Mm, Nn, NG ng, Pp, Rr, Ss, Tt, Ww, and Yy. They are {{pronounced}} {{the same way}} as in English but a little bit lighter than their English equivalents. An exception is the letter [...] "r" [...] which is prevalent in Kinaray-a. It is sounded by flicking the tip of the tongue {{against the back of the}} upper front teeth and <b>rolled</b> <b>a</b> bit. Likewise the letters g, w, and y are also pronounced a bit harder as a terminal letter of a word with a grave accent mark. Except for [...] foreign loan words, the consonants c, f, j, q, x, and z don’t appear in Kinaray-a words. If foreign words are without Kinaray-a equivalent, they are either written as is, or written as pronounced using the Kinaray-a alphabet.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{moose test}} (swerving {{to avoid an}} obstacle), which became famous in Germany as [...] "the elk test", the Swedish {{journalist}} Robert Collin of Teknikens Värld (World of Technology) in October 1997 <b>rolled</b> <b>a</b> Mercedes A-Class (without ESC) at 78km/h. Because Mercedes-Benz promotes a reputation for safety, they recalled and retrofitted 130,000 A-Class cars with ESC. This produced {{a significant reduction in}} crashes and the number of vehicles with ESC rose. Today, virtually all premium brands have made ESC standard on all vehicles, and the number of models with ESC continues to increase. The availability of ESC in small cars like the A-Class ignited a market trend thus ESC became available for all models at least as an option. Consequently, the European Union decided in 2009 to make ESC mandatory. [...] Since November 1, 2011, EU Type Approval is only granted to models equipped with ESC. By November 1, 2014, ESC is required on all newly registered cars in the EU.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of 23 October, Turner was acting as an advance ASW escort for the convoy when she picked up an {{unidentified}} surface contact on her SG radar. At 19:43, about 11 minutes after the initial radar contact, Turners lookouts made visual contact with what {{proved to be a}} German submarine running on the surface, decks awash, at about [...] distance. Almost simultaneously, Turner turned hard to starboard and opened fire with her , Bofors, and Oerlikon guns. During the next few seconds, the destroyer scored one [...] hit on the U-boat's conning tower as well as several 40- and 20-millimeter hits there and elsewhere. The submarine began to dive immediately and deprived Turner of any opportunity to ram her. However, while the U-boat made her dive, Turner began a depth-charge attack. She fired two charges from her port K-gun battery, and both appeared to hit the water just above the submerged U-boat. Then, as the destroyer swung around above the U-boat, Turner <b>rolled</b> <b>a</b> single depth charge off her stern. Soon after the three depth charges exploded, Turner crewmen heard a fourth explosion, the shock from which caused the destroyer to lose power to her SG and SD radars, to the main battery, and to her sound gear. It took her at least 15 minutes to restore power entirely.|$|E
