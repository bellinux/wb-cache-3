500|$|The wing {{leading edges}} were swept {{back to a}} point inline with the engine nacelles, while the {{trailing}} edges were angled forward slightly. The wing contained two 700L (190US gal) fuel tanks between the inner wing main spars, while {{at the head of}} the main spar the oil coolers were fitted. Between the outer spars, a second pair of <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> were located, carrying an individual capacity of 910L (240US gal) of fuel. The outer trailing edges were formed by the ailerons and flaps, which were met by smooth wing tips which curved forward into the leading edge. The outer leading edge sections were installed in the shape of a curved [...] "strip nosed" [...] rib, which was positioned ahead of the main spar. Most of the interior ribs were not solid, with the exception of the ribs located between the rear main spar and the flaps and ailerons. These were of solid construction, though even they had lightening holes.|$|E

2500|$|May was {{hampered}} by the Jaguar's limited fuel range and an unreliable petrol gauge which caused him to make frequent filling station stops {{out of fear of}} running out of fuel. Hammond had attempted to prolong his fuel stops to the very last possible moment by employing the Vincent's <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> This backfired after his fuel stop [...] south of Doncaster, as Hammond was forced to pull over in the rain after breaking down. Having failed to close the reserve tank tap, sludge from the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> had entered the fuel lines and blocked the left hand carburettor.|$|R
2500|$|To {{keep them}} {{clear of the}} spray of take-off, each of the Robbe's two [...] BMW IV {{water-cooled}} six cylinder upright inline engines was mounted in pusher configuration high above the wings on vertical faired steel tube N-form struts, the forward inner one particularly sturdy, and with transverse V-strut bracing with its apex on the central, upper fuselage.

50|$|Early on Wednesday 13 June 1917, Hauptmann Ernst Brandenberg left an {{airfield}} near Ghent in Belgium with {{a formation}} of 20 Gotha G.IV aircraft from Kampfgeschwader der Obersten Heeresleitung 3 (Kagohl 3), {{as part of}} Operation TÃ¼rkenkreuz, the German plan for the strategic bombing of London. The aircraft had been fitted with extra <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> to enable a non-stop flight. Two quickly turned back, but the other 18 aircraft made good progress in clear but hazy summer skies. They flew over the English Channel, and one dropped bombs on Margate. Three bombed Shoeburyness, and one left to undertake aerial photo-reconnaissance over Greenwich.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sinking of}} INS Khurki was {{followed}} by another attack on Karachi port {{on the night of}} 8/9 December 1971 under codename: Python. A squadron of Indian Navy's Osa missile boats approached the Karachi port and launched series of Soviet-acquired Styx missiles that resulted in further destruction of <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> and the sinking of three Pakistani merchant ships as well as foreign ships docked in Karachi. The Pakistan Air Force did not attack the Indian Navy ships and confusion remains the next day when the civilian pilots of Pakistan International, acting as reconnaissance war pilots, misidentified [...] and the air force attacked its own warship, inflicting major damages to warship and killing several officers on board.|$|E
50|$|The T.VIII W/G was a mid-winged {{monoplane}} with {{a three-part}} fuselage of oval cross-section {{which consisted of}} a light alloy nose, a centre section of wood and a tail of steel frame with a fabric covering. The wing was constructed with two cross-beams with bakelite ribs and clad in plywood. In the T.VIII W/M variant the tail, {{as well as the}} wings, were constructed from light alloy. The undercarriage consisted of two floats of rustproof duralumin with six waterproof compartments and a <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> in each.|$|R

25|$|The C.205 was a single-seat, all-metal, {{monoplane}} fighter, {{intended primarily}} as an interceptor but with ground attack and escort capabilities. The long nose housed the DB605 engine which drove a three-blade, constant-speed metal propeller, {{with the main}} <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> situated between the engine and the cockpit. The radiator was located under the centre section of the fuselage beneath the cockpit while the short rear section housed the radio equipment, oxygen cylinder and an 80L (20US gal) <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> The wings were made of light aluminium alloys and steel, having two spars and three sections, housing two additional <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks,</b> and the fully retractable wide-set main undercarriage gear. Apart from the all-metal flaps in the inner wing, all the other control surfaces were metal-framed and fabric-covered. Veltros had self-sealing <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks,</b> an armoured seat, and armoured windscreen as standard. The cramped cockpit possessed a limited field-of-view, but some examples were fitted with a rear-view mirror.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the western}} theatre of the war, the Indian Navy {{successfully}} attacked Karachi's port in Operation Trident {{on the night}} of 4-5 December, using missile boats, sinking Pakistani destroyer PNS Khyber and minesweeper PNS Muhafiz; PNS Shah Jahan was also badly damaged. In response, Pakistani submarines sought out major Indian warships. 720 Pakistani sailors were killed or wounded, and Pakistan lost reserve fuel and many commercial ships, thus crippling the Pakistan Navy's further involvement in the conflict. Operation Trident was followed by Operation Python {{on the night of}} 8-9 December, in which Indian missile boats attacked the Karachi port, resulting in further destruction of <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> and the sinking of three Pakistani merchant ships. Since Pakistan's naval headquarters and almost its entire fleet operated from the port city of Karachi, this was a major strategic victory that enabled the Indian navy to attain complete naval superiority, and to partially blockade Pakistan.|$|E

50|$|On her ninth patrol, from 29 May to 11 June, {{she carried}} ammunition, oil, and dry stores to Colonel R.V. Bowler on Mindanao. Between 12 June and 27 June, she transported a similar cargo to Negros Island and {{embarked}} evacuees, including one German POW, for Darwin. During her 11th patrol, from 30 June to 27 July, she landed a reconnaissance party and 12 tons of stores on North Pandan Island, and more supplies to Colonel Kangleon on Leyte and Colonel Abcede on Mindanao. On her 12th, 13th and 14th patrols, {{she returned to}} the central Philippines, landed personnel and supplies at various points on Mindanao and Luzon, and carried evacuees to Australia. On 25 September, during the first of these three patrols, she grounded on Iuisan Shoal. Forced to lighten her load, her evacuees, mail, captured documents, and cargo were sent ashore. All secret materials were burned. Her <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> were blown dry, variable ballast was blown overboard and six-inch (152 mm) ammunition jettisoned. With the blowing of her main ballast tanks she was finally able to get off the reef within three and a half hours, despite the receding tide, and clear the area by dawn.|$|E
5000|$|Journalist Bill Boddy tested {{an early}} model Brough Superior Saloon in 1936 for Motor Sport magazine.

After begging petrol from a passing lorry Boddy then encountered a motorcyclist who had crashed, and offered to help. When asked, he told Boddy that his bike was a Brough Superior and asked what was, [...] "...the nice car in which you are giving me a lift." [...] When told it was a Brough Superior the motorcyclist was silent {{for the rest of the}} journey. Boddy presumed this was incredulity that a famed motorcycle maker could also manufacture cars, and supposed that the motorcyclist presumed he was concussed.|$|R

50|$|The Ronson {{was also}} {{attached}} to the Churchill tank. Fraser was told that a tank was preferable to the universal carrier as a mount for a flame thrower because {{it was very much}} less vulnerable. A Churchill MkII tank was modified as a prototype by 24 March 1942, it had a pair of Ronson projectors one {{on either side of the}} front of the hull, they could not be aimed except by moving the entire vehicle. Fuel was held in a pair of containers projecting from the rear of the vehicle. Major J. M. Oke contributed to the design, including a suggestion that the fuel be held in the <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> - a lightly armoured standard fitting available for the Churchill tank. The design was reduced to a single flame projector and became known as the Churchill Oke. Three Churchill Okes were included as part of the tank support for the Dieppe Raid but did not use the flamethrowers in combat.|$|R
5000|$|The 94th and 95th had {{the task}} {{of dealing with the}} type's {{teething}} troubles. Initially undercarriages failed on landing - this was corrected by using heavier bracing wire. The Nieuport 28's 160 hp Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine and fuel system proved unreliable and prone to fires. Field improvements to fuel lines, and increased familiarity of the American pilots (and their ground crews) with the requirements of monosoupape engines reduced these problems, but the definitive solution adopted was simply not completely filling the <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank,</b> at the expense of range. More seriously, a structural problem emerged - during a sharp pull out from a steep dive, the plywood leading edge of the top wing could break away, taking the fabric with it. [...] On the whole, although the pilots of the 94th and the 95th appreciated the manoeverability and good handling of the Nieuport, and were reasonably happy with its general performance, they regarded the type as fragile and dangerous.|$|R

30|$|AO {{is another}} {{important}} dependent factor related to the fuel efficiency. According to Peeters et al. [62] and Hileman et al. [32] improved aviation operations have resulted in better value of fuel efficiency. The relationships between operational efficiency and efficiency are expressed by payload fuel efficiency equation [21, 32]. Therefore, aircraft operational efficiency were {{measured in terms of}} parameters such as aircraft range [4, 51], <b>fuel</b> weight, <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> weight, payload, aircraft speed, crew weight, takeoff filed length, and landing filed length ([2, 4, 5, 27, 29, 65]). Aircraft range is the total distance that an aircraft can fly with full <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> We can improve the aircraft fuel consumption by optimizing the aircraft range. Optimized <b>fuel</b> weight, <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> weight, and crew weight have also contributed toward the improved fuel efficiency [2, 27]. The payload rate is another operational performance indicator that is commonly used to assess fuel burn. Air transport emission can be reduced with increased payload (reduce the number of empty seats flown) while optimizing the flight frequencies. Also, optimized aircraft speed [5], has also improved the fuel efficiency of airliners [4, 65]. Optimum values of takeoff filed length, and landing filed length also affects positively the fuel efficiency. So, therefore we have included the aircraft range, <b>fuel</b> weight, <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> weight, payload, aircraft speed, crew weight, takeoff filed length, and landing filed length to measure AO construct.|$|R

In order to understand and improve the crashworthiness of the soft <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> of helicopter during the crash, this paper investigated the dynamic behavior of the nylon woven fabric composite <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> striking on the ground. A fluidâstructure interaction finite element model of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> based on the arbitrary LagrangianâEulerian method was constructed to elucidate the dynamic failure behavior. The drop impact tests were conducted to validate the accuracy of the numerical simulation. Good agreement was achieved between the experimental and numerical results of the impact force with the ground. The influences of the impact velocity, the impact angle, the thickness of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> wall and the volume fraction of water on the dynamic responses of the dropped <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> were studied.
