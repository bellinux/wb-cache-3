5|$|The median house {{price in}} Canberra as of September 2009 was $511,820, lower than only Sydney among capital cities {{of more than}} 100,000 people, having surpassed Melbourne and Perth since 2005. The median weekly <b>rent</b> <b>paid</b> by Canberra {{residents}} is higher than rents in all other states and territories. As at January 2014 the median unit rent in Canberra was $410 per week and median housing rent was $460, making the city the third most expensive in the country. Factors contributing to this higher weekly rental market include; higher average weekly incomes, restricted land supply, and inflationary clauses in the ACT Residential Tenancies Act.|$|E

The replica that stands in Constitution Square houses {{the offices of the}} Convention and Tourism Bureau and The Great American Brass Band Festival. When Boyle County took over Constitution Square, the fiscal court agreed to waive the <b>rent</b> <b>paid</b> by the Convention and Tourism Bureau in exchange for its in-kind services managing the park jointly with the Boyle County Industrial Foundation. Danville Mayor Bernie Hunstad opposed the arrangement, fearing that park management would dilute both organizations' primary missions of bringing jobs to the area. In March 2013, Hunstad resigned his ex-officio membership on the Boyle County Industrial Foundation in protest.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the Liberals gained {{office on}} Prince Edward Island. They {{immediately}} went about putting in place measures to gradually dismantle the proprietor/tenant system, although their efforts generally had limited effect largely because Samuel Cunard, who owned one-sixth of the Island, refused to sell {{any of his}} land. In 1864, the tenants organised into the Tenant League, and vowed to resist the collection of rent by their proprietors. Efforts by law enforcement to quell this rebellion had little effect, so {{the government of the}} island requested the assistance of British troops to enforce the collection of rent. In 1865, British troops arrived in the colony and successfully enforced the collection of the unpaid rent, and the Tenant League crumbled. It appeared that the operation of the Tenant League was a matter of principle rather than practical necessity; the <b>rent</b> <b>paid</b> by tenants to the proprietors was to the amount of one shilling per acre, and the proprietors allowed rent to go unpaid for years at a time.|$|E

25|$|Opposition MP Péter Szijjártó, as {{the head}} of a {{committee}} set up to investigate the origins of Gyurcsány's wealth, stated in his report that one of Gyurcsány's companies leased the former vacation site of the Hungarian government in Balatonőszöd and rented the site back to a state-owned company so that the <b>rent</b> <b>paid</b> by the government covered exactly the leasing fee during the first {{two and a half years}} of the ten-year lease term (1994–2004).|$|E
25|$|The {{budgetary}} slippage with the Public–private partnerships (PPPs): between 2008 and 2010 the accounts slipped 560.2 million euros, mainly {{due to the}} <b>rents</b> <b>paid</b> to road concessions, to which were paid more 425.5 million euros than it was budgeted. In 2011 the slippage in the rents with the road concessions rose 28% to 197.4 million euros above what was budgeted and rose 42.3% to 266.3 million euros above what had been forecasted for 2010. The State spent a total of 896.6 million euros in rents to the road concessions. The <b>rents</b> <b>paid</b> to the PPPs in the health and rail sectors also slipped considerably.|$|R
2500|$|A housing {{cooperative}} is normally de facto non-profit, since usually {{most of its}} income comes from the <b>rents</b> <b>paid</b> by its residents (if in a formal corporation, then shareholders), who are invariably its members. There {{is no point in}} creating a deliberate surplus—except for operational requirements such as setting aside funds for replacement of assets—since that simply means that the <b>rents</b> <b>paid</b> by members are set higher than the expenses. (Note, however, that it's quite possible for a housing co-op to own other revenue-generating assets, such as a subsidiary business which could produce surplus income to offset the cost of the housing, but in those cases the housing rents are usually reduced to compensate for the additional revenue.) ...|$|R

25|$|To {{save the}} {{building}} from bankruptcy, the management {{company of the}} building opened an observatory on the 86th floor and allowed public access to a large terrace on the eighty-first floor. A wedding chapel was also added to the building's 80th floor. This made the tower one of the city's major tourist attractions, and during {{the first years of}} operation, revenues from tourism equaled the total amount of <b>rent</b> <b>paid</b> by all tenants.

2500|$|Non-working foreigners {{resident}} in Switzerland {{may choose to}} pay a [...] "lump-sum tax" [...] instead of the normal income tax. The tax, which is generally {{much lower than the}} normal income tax, is nominally levied on the taxpayer's living expenses, but in practice (which varies from canton to canton), it is common to use the quintuple of the <b>rent</b> <b>paid</b> by the taxpayer as a basis for the lump-sum taxation. This option contributes to Switzerland's status as a tax haven, and has induced many wealthy foreigners to live in Switzerland.|$|E
2500|$|Conrail made initial {{plans to}} sell the bridge to bridge enthusiast and lawyer Donald L. Pevsner, by an option granted to him on February 1, 1984. Later in 1984, Conrail advised Pevsner to take title of the bridge in a shell corporation, with no assets but the bridge and no funds to pay for {{necessary}} insurance and maintenance; the railroad {{just wanted to be}} rid of the bridge, whatever the dubious ethics of such disposal. This decision was made personally by then-Conrail Chairman L. Stanley Crane, at a time when Conrail was owned by the U.S. Government. Pevsner refused, and let his option expire on November 1, 1984. [...] One day later, on November 2, 1984, Conrail sold the bridge for $1 to a convicted bank swindler (SEE Poughkeepsie JOURNAL: various issues) and ex-felon named Gordon Schreiber Miller, of St. Davids, Pennsylvania, to [...] "get it off the books.". For the next fourteen years, Miller and his successor, Vito Moreno, spent little or nothing on maintenance or insurance, while attempting to drastically increase the $25,000 annual <b>rent</b> <b>paid</b> by Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation for its three 115,000-volt and three 69,000-volt power lines across the Hudson, attached to {{the south side of the}} bridge since 1949. In response, Central Hudson de-energized those power lines and relocated them under the river in 1985, thereby ending Miller's only source of bridge income. During this long period, critical bridge navigation lights were mostly inoperative, resulting in large U.S. Coast Guard fines against the Miller corporation that all went unpaid. Further, all of the 2,200-pound brackets that connected Central Hudson's de-energized high-tension power lines to the south side of the bridge continued to deteriorate by rusting. Though Central Hudson admitted that it normally had a legal duty to remove its abandoned power lines, it refused to remove its abandoned bridge-affixed lines, instead relying on a claim that it no longer owned the lines at issue pursuant to prior litigation with Conrail that was decided on September 26, 1984, and won a similar legal opinion before the New York State Public Service Commission in 1995, which was left to stand on April 1, 1999 when The Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge Company, Inc., as the successor owner to Gordon Schreiber Miller and Vito Moreno, withdrew its 1998 complaint against Central Hudson on January 27, 1999.|$|E

60|$|No one {{can deny}} that rent {{sometimes}} enters into {{cost of production}} [of other than agricultural products]. If I buy or rent a piece of ground, and build a cloth-manufactory on it, the ground-rent forms legitimately {{a part of my}} expenses of production, which must be repaid by the product. And since all factories are built on ground, and most of them in places where ground is peculiarly valuable, the <b>rent</b> <b>paid</b> for it must, on the average, be compensated in the values of all things made in factories. In what sense it is true that rent does not enter into the cost of production or affect the value of agricultural produce will be shown in the succeeding chapter.|$|E

50|$|The {{equation}} of new value added with net output or GDP (also known as gross value added) {{would have made}} no sense to Marx, mainly because net output includes depreciation (or the consumption of fixed capital), yet excludes various property <b>rents</b> <b>paid</b> by producing enterprises from their gross income (on the ground that renting out an asset does not itself constitute production) as well as a portion of net interest (regarded as property income).|$|R

He saw, as if visible in the air before him, in illuminated figures, the whole sum, and the subtraction that followed and that gave a remainder of $43.90.
