His students were growing cynical about the benefits of science to humanity because of the controversy surrounding the Vietnam War. To give them something relevant to study, he began using examples from the Apollo program as applications of elementary physics. O'Neill posed the question during an extra seminar he gave to a few of his students: [...] "Is the surface of a planet really the <b>right</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> an expanding technological civilization?"

500|$|There are {{two songs}} about falling in love, [...] "Mi Lugar Favorito" [...] and [...] "Vámonos Negrito". The former, {{arranged}} to emulate emotional outbursts, {{was the most}} difficult to finish, and the singer had a hard time trying to find the <b>right</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> it on the album. [...] "Vámonos Negrito" [...] is a tribute to her Latin American roots that she started writing after a show in Colombia and finished in Cuba; in this song, one of her favorites, she tried to create a musical landscape with instruments, textures, and harmonies. The bolero [...] "Antes de Huir", is a [...] "sad and hopeful" [...] song. It is about not letting go of the things we love. [...] "Ya No Te Puedo Querer" [...] is, according to Lafourcade, an obscure folk-pop song about finding that one cannot be in a relationship anymore; it was written during a concert tour in Monterrey.|$|E
500|$|The regular Football League {{restarted}} in {{time for}} the 1946–47 season. Ramsey moved into club-owned lodgings in Southampton with a close friend from the army, Alf Freeman, an inside-forward who had also signed for the club. Ramsey started the season in the reserve team, selected at centre-forward, and scored in each of the first three games. After five matches, Dodgin and the club trainer Sydney Cann made a decision that changed the course of Ramsey's entire professional playing career: deciding that neither centre-half nor centre-forward truly suited him, they moved him to right-back. McKinstry calls this [...] "exactly the <b>right</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> Alf", citing Ramsey's tactical knowledge and fine passing. A close master-and-pupil relationship developed between Ramsey and Cann, who had played at full-back for Torquay United, Manchester City and Charlton Athletic. During training sessions, the two had long discussions about tactics and individual techniques. [...] wanted to learn about the game from top to bottom," [...] Cann recalled; [...] "I have never known anyone with the same quickness of learning as Alf Ramsey. He would never accept anything on its face value... He was the type of player who was a manager's dream because you could talk about a decision and he would accept it and there it was, in his game." ...|$|E

The Transitional Labor Market project uses the TLM model as a means of developing new thinking on how flexibility and innovation might be paired with social investment and new forms of social protection. TLM theory emphasizes the importance of institutions and of the links between different institutions which frequently operate as policy silos, rather than integrated systems to buffer risks and support capability and enhance employability. The great advantage of the TLM model is that it draws attention to the <b>right</b> <b>places</b> <b>for</b> strategic reform.
