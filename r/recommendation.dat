When informed by his commanding officer, Commander Kerr, of the intention to recommend him, Hichens requested that the <b>recommendation</b> be dropped as he now felt he had endangered two of the boats in the flotilla trying to rescue his friends. Kerr, respecting his views, dropped the <b>recommendation,</b> only {{for it to be}} resubmitted six weeks later after his death. The <b>recommendation</b> was endorsed by Commander Kerr, Admiral Lyon (the Commander-in-chief at Nore) and Rear Admiral Rogers (the Flag officer in charge at Harwich).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate whether it is possible to construct a computer system that provides good price <b>recommendations</b> for marketers in the export wool industry. The computer system is a program that stores and makes use of expert knowledge in the course of providing <b>recommendations</b> to a user. "Good" price <b>recommendations</b> are ones that closely resemble those of a consensus of experts. Fuzzy logic, a method of inexact reasoning, is used to derive <b>recommendations</b> from inexact rules in the system. The system allows users to input vague expressions used in natural language, translates them into nonfuzzy values and then performs a set of operations on them to produce a nonfuzzy recommended price. The effectiveness of the system in making good price decisions was tested by comparing the system's <b>recommendations</b> with consensus <b>recommendations</b> from a panel of experts. The correlation coefficient between the system's <b>recommendations</b> and the consensus <b>recommendations</b> was found to be higher than any of the correlation coefficients between the individual manager's first <b>recommendations</b> and the consensus <b>recommendations.</b> This suggests that the system constructed is capable of providing good price <b>recommendations...</b>|$|R
