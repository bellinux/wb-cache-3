5|$|In 1904, Coolsma {{published}} a <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> his grammar. Working with fellow missionary Christiaan Albers, {{who had also}} preached in Cianjur, Coolsma {{published a}} Dutch-Sundanese dictionary in 1911; {{this was followed by}} a <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> his Sundanese-Dutch dictionary in 1913. Coolsma's wife died on 27 September 1917. Her death led him to reduce his workload, although he found time to publish his memoirs, Terugblik op mijn levensweg, 1840–1924 (Looking Back on my Life, 1840–1924), in 1924. He died two years later, on 20 March 1926.|$|E
5|$|A <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> {{the game}} was resubmitted to the ACB and {{reclassified}} as MA 15+ on August 7, 2008, or not suitable for people {{under the age of}} 15 unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian; this new rating ensured that the game could retail legally in Australia. According to the ACB board report, the drug content was not removed entirely from the <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the game, but the animation showing the actual usage of the drugs was removed; the minority view on the decision stated that the drug content was still enough to warrant a refused classification rating.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1st {{millennium}} BC, hieroglyphs and hieratic {{were still}} used for royal, monumental, religious, and funerary writings, while a new, even more cursive script {{was used for}} informal, day-to-day writing: Demotic. The final script adopted by the ancient Egyptians was the Coptic alphabet, a <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the Greek alphabet. Coptic became the standard in the 4th century AD when Christianity became the state religion throughout the Roman Empire; hieroglyphs were discarded as idolatrous images of a pagan tradition, unfit for writing the Biblical canon.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Biman {{went through}} a {{rebranding}} exercise and unveiled a new logo and livery, designed by Teague, which was applied to its leased Boeing 777 and 737 aircraft. However, following change of government, Biman was forced to revert to the original branding as the new brand image was not endorsed by the incoming government. The carrier has adopted a new, more modern <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> its livery, that {{was applied to the}} new Boeing 777-300ERs delivered in late 2011.|$|E
5|$|The <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (the WAIS-R) was {{developed}} by David Wechsler and published by Psychological Corporation in 1981.

5|$|In July 1937, the Atlantic Monthly {{accepted}} a <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> an essay, The World of Waters, that she originally wrote {{for her first}} fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as Undersea, was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house Simon & Schuster, impressed by Undersea, contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in Under the Sea Wind (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued—her features appeared in Sun Magazine, Nature, and Collier's.|$|E
5|$|Initially, twelve {{ships were}} ordered {{based on the}} P-class design. The ships were ordered under the {{provisional}} names P1 through P12; the contracts were awarded {{to a number of}} German shipyards, including Deutsche Werke in Kiel, Blohm & Voss in Hamburg, and the KM Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven. However, Plan Z was reduced in size, and the number of armored ships was pared down to only eight vessels. This caused several of the contracts to be shifted around amongst the various shipbuilding companies. The first keel was set to be laid on 1 Feb 1940. The <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Plan Z, approved on 27 July 1939, removed the P-class ships from the construction queue. Instead, {{the decision was made to}} build the O-class battlecruisers only.|$|E
5|$|T. E. Lawrence, perhaps {{better known}} as Lawrence of Arabia, was {{stationed}} at nearby RAF Cranwell just after the war, in 1926, where he wrote a <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> his Seven Pillars Of Wisdom. He mentioned Navenby {{in a letter to}} a friend at the time, saying: I'm too shy to go looking for dirt. That's why I can't go off stewing into the Lincoln or Navenby brothels with the fellows. They think it's because I'm superior: proud, or peculiar or 'posh', as they say: and its because I wouldn't know what to do, how to carry myself, where to stop. Fear again: fear everywhere.|$|E

5|$|The {{pamphlet}} contained woodblock illustrations and {{was printed}} without attribution to Gray, at his request. Immediately after, Owen's magazine with Gray's poem was printed but contained multiple errors and other problems. In a 20 February letter to Walpole, Gray {{thanked him for}} intervening and helping to get a quality version of the poem published before Owen. It was so popular that it was reprinted twelve times and reproduced in many different periodicals until 1765, including in Gray's Six Poems (1753), in his Odes (1757), and in Volume IV of Dodsley's 1755 compilation of poetry. The <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> 1768 was that later printed.|$|E
5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived in}} Saint Petersburg {{in time to}} hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts, one of which {{included}} the first complete performance of {{the final version of}} his First Symphony and another the premiere of the <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony. Before this visit he had spent much time keeping in touch with Rimsky-Korsakov and those around him. Rimsky-Korsakov, along with Alexander Glazunov, Anatol Lyadov and several other nationalistically-minded composers and musicians, had formed a group called the Belyayev circle. This group was named after timber merchant Mitrofan Belyayev, an amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher after he had taken an interest in Glazunov's work. During Tchaikovsky's visit, he spent much time in the company of these men, and his somewhat fraught relationship with The Five would meld into a more harmonious one with the Belyayev circle. This relationship would last until his death in late 1893.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the Nice model Jupiter trojans are {{captured}} when Jupiter encounters an ice giant during the instability. In {{this version of}} the Nice model one of the ice giants (Uranus, Neptune, or a lost fifth planet) is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is scattered outward by Jupiter causing the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to quickly separate. When Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps during these encounters existing Jupiter trojans can escape and new objects with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter's new semi-major axis {{are captured}}. Following its last encounter the ice giant can pass through one of the libration points and perturb their orbits leaving this libration point depleted relative to the other. After the encounters end some of these Jupiter trojans are lost and others captured when Jupiter and Saturn are near weak mean motion resonances such as the 3:7 resonance via the mechanism of the original Nice model.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} {{practice}} session on Saturday evening, the two Ferraris were in front, with Vettel fastest at 1:45.682, while Räikkönen was {{almost half a}} second off his teammate's pace. The two Red Bull cars of Kvyat and Ricciardo were behind, followed by both Mercedes cars, who trailed Vettel {{by more than a}} second. Meanwhile, Fernando Alonso continued McLaren's good form and finished seventh fastest. Lewis Hamilton had several problems during the session; an early run was interrupted by him leaving the track and he was later called to drive through the pit lane to cool down his overheating car. Valtteri Bottas was the fastest Williams driver in eleventh, just in front of Nico Hülkenberg, who drove a <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> his Force India. The two Manor Marussia cars were again last, with Rossi almost three seconds ahead of Stevens.|$|E
5|$|Launched on 10 May 1940, the <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Unternehmen Gelb (Operation Yellow), {{also known}} as the Manstein Plan, succeeded. Unfortunately for the Germans, the British Army escaped during the Battle of Dunkirk. Nevertheless, the Belgian Army, Dutch Army and most of the elite French forces were {{destroyed}} in the encirclement. This left just second rate French units to combat the entire German Army. The Luftwaffe had played an integral part in disrupting Allied operations in this early phase. The Luftwaffe's participation was particularly crucial during the Battle of Sedan which enabled the German Army to carry out Operation Yellow. By early June the Dunkirk siege was over, and on 3 June, the Germans began preparations for the conquest of the rest of France under the codename Fall Rot (Case Red). For this to be as successful, air superiority would be required first, as it had been during Operation Yellow.|$|E
5|$|Musidora {{is based}} on , a poem by the Scottish poet and playwright James Thomson (best known today {{as the author of}} Rule, Britannia!). Summer was {{initially}} published in 1727 and was republished in an altered form in 1730 along with Thomson's Winter (1726), Spring (1728) and Autumn (1730) as The Seasons. Although the individual poems attracted little interest on their release, The Seasons proved critically and commercially successful once completed, and Thomson began to associate with important and influential London political and cultural figures. In June 1744 Thomson published a drastically <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> The Seasons, which became extremely influential over the following century. Joseph Haydn wrote a major oratorio based on the poem, significant artists including Thomas Gainsborough, J. M. W. Turner and Richard Westall painted scenes from it, and over 400 editions of The Seasons in a number of languages were published between 1744 and 1870.|$|E

5|$|The European Championship was Razer's next—and final—televised tournament, {{for which}} it {{qualified}} as reigning World Champion. It defeated Dutch champions Pulveriser {{to set up a}} semi-final against Tornado. Razer's adversaries attached the anti-crusher frame used in their previous meeting in the series six grand final; the Razer team installed a <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the lifting hook. Tornado was the early aggressor, until Razer picked it up with the hook and dragged it towards the pit. The size of Tornado's framework made it difficult for Razer to drop it in, and the strain of lifting Tornado burnt out Razer's drive motors. Razer was immobile {{at the end of the}} match, but the result went to a judges' decision. They awarded victory to Razer for being in control of the fight, but in a split decision the team decided this was unfair and conceded to Tornado, who beat Philliper 2 in the final to claim the European title.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS (NDS) {{features}} a touch screen and built-in microphone, and supports wireless IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards. Additionally, the <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the NDS, the Nintendo DSi, features two built in cameras, {{the ability to}} download games from the DSi store, and a web browser. The PlayStation Portable (PSP) released later the same year on December 12, 2004, followed a different pattern. It became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its primary storage media. Sony also gave the PSP robust multi-media capability, connectivity with the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2 (only on some games), other PSPs, as well as Internet connectivity. The Nintendo DS likewise had connectivity to the internet through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and Nintendo DS Browser, as well as wireless connectivity to other DS systems and Wii consoles. Despite high sales numbers for both consoles, PlayStation Portable sales have consistently lagged behind those of the Nintendo DS; nevertheless, the PlayStation Portable has {{the distinction of being}} the best-selling non-Nintendo handheld gaming system.|$|E
