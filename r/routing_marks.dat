40|$|Abstract. This study investigates how the Constraint-based routing de-cision {{granularity}} signicantly aects the scalability {{and blocking}} perfor-mance of QoS routing in MPLS network. The coarse-grained granularity, such as per-destination, has lower storage and computational overheads but is only suitable for best-eort traÆc. On the other hand, the ne-grained granularity, such as per- ow, provides lower blocking probability for bandwidth requests, but requires {{a huge number}} of states and high computational cost. To achieve cost-eective scalability, this study proposes using hybrid granularity schemes. The Over owed cache of the per-pair / ow scheme adds a per-pair cache and a per- ow cache as the routing cache, and performs well in blocking probability with a reasonable over ow ratio of 10 % as oered load= 0. 7. Per-pair/class scheme groups the ows into several paths using <b>routing</b> <b>marks,</b> thus allowing packets to be label-forwarded with a bounded cache. ...|$|E
50|$|Gifford Nielsen {{passed and}} ran for two touchdowns and Brigham Young's defense turned Utah fumbles into three more scores in the 51-20 <b>rout.</b> <b>Mark</b> Uselman also kicked field goals of 47, 47 and 44 yards as the Cougars won their fourth {{in a row in}} the series.|$|R
50|$|Boston scored four {{goals in}} the second period, and another four {{goals in the}} third, which {{resulted}} in an 8-1 <b>rout.</b> <b>Mark</b> Recchi scored two of them; Brad Marchand and Daniel Paille each scored shorthanded; and Andrew Ference, David Krejci, Chris Kelly and Michael Ryder each tallied {{one of the other}} four. Tim Thomas stopped 40 out of 41 shots, only allowing a third period goal by Jannik Hansen.|$|R
50|$|A John Fitzgibbon {{goal for}} Cork after just 16 seconds {{set the tone}} for what would be a {{complete}} <b>rout.</b> <b>Mark</b> Foley and Dan O'Connell added two more goals to give Cork a comfortable 3-7 to 0-2 half-time lead. O'Connell added his second and Cork's fourth goal ten minutes into the second half. John Feehan pegged one back for Kilkenny midway through the half, however, the cause was lost.|$|R
50|$|The two armies met at Espiel on 2 June 1010 and {{the forces}} of the Caliphate of Cordoba were decisively <b>routed,</b> <b>marking</b> one of the first battles of the war and a {{significant}} gain for the rebel Catalan-Andalusian alliance. Although this battle took place in the general time frame of the Spanish Reconquista, it was not unusual for Christian and Muslim forces to join together to achieve common goals.|$|R
2500|$|The State of Texas {{took this}} <b>routing</b> and <b>marked</b> the {{remaining}} county roads as State Highway OSR. Originally, the whole route from the Sabine River to San Marcos carried this designation, {{but it has}} since {{been reduced to a}} short bypass around Bryan.|$|R

50|$|On June 28, {{playing against}} the Detroit Tigers, Jason Bay and Carlos Beltrán both hit grand slams in a 14-3 <b>rout.</b> It <b>marked</b> {{only the second}} time in Mets history that the team hit two grand slams in the same game (the other time coming in 2006 when Beltran and Cliff Floyd {{connected}} in the same inning against the Cubs). It also broke a drought in which the Mets had not hit a grand slam in 299 team games, during which the Mets were out-grand slammed 18-0.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the routing of data traffic to {{multiple}} gateways with a network operating system MikroTik RouterOS, which has become widespread in the small firms and home users. It is aimed to describe the problem with using multiple gateways. RouterOS description itself and its core components needed to solve this issue, such as <b>routing,</b> packet <b>marking</b> and quality assuranceservices. It also {{deals with the}} description of the particular design and testing. The proposedsolution is verified on the example of a real situation. Finally, the proposed solution is compared to alternative solutions, commonly used in practice...|$|R
5000|$|When it was {{designated}} in 1937, SR 744 ran from its intersection where it splits off of Main Street in Somerville {{to its current}} eastern terminus at SR 122 east of Jacksonburg. At the time, Main Street through Somerville was the routing of US 127. [...] By 1961, U.S. Route 127 was routed onto a new alignment west of Somerville, resulting in an extension of SR 744. From its previous western terminus, State Route 744 was routed north along the former alignment of US 127 to the County Road 30 intersection north of Somerville, and then west to the now-current US 127 <b>routing,</b> which <b>marks</b> the current western endpoint of the state highway.|$|R
5000|$|North Carolina Highway 86 Truck (NC 86 Truck) is a {{bypass route}} for truck drivers that are {{traveling}} through the city of Hillsborough. This 8.3 mi route goes west around the entire city, via I-85 (between exits 165 and 160), I-85 Connector and US 70. The <b>routing</b> is well <b>marked</b> throughout and there are warning signs for truck drivers, including [...] "tolerance ends," [...] for that continue through the city.|$|R

He is a fine orator, {{and makes}} up by his round sentences and choice phrases for the rhetorical deficiencies of his chief, who, to speak the truth, is somewhat curt and husky. They have enough now to do to manage their comrades and keep a semblance of discipline in their <b>routed</b> ranks. <b>Mark</b> that ferocious Briareus there scowling in a corner! Didst ever see such a moustache! He glances, methinks, with an evil eye on the mighty Enceladus; and, let me tell you, Briareus has a great following among them; so they say of him you know, that he hath fifty heads and a hundred arms. See! how they gather around him.' ...|$|R

The match was played in heavy rain in front of 5,617 fans and Australia, captained by Wally Lewis, ran in nine tries to one in a 37-7 <b>rout.</b> The game <b>marked</b> the first time Lewis, who would take over the Test captaincy in 1984, captained Australia in an international match.|$|R
5000|$|The last date of {{the month}} of Chaitra is called by the Bodos as the Bwisâgu for the cows or cattle. On that day the Bodos leads the cattle to the tank or the river for bathing. Before taking to the river or tank the cattle are offered paddy and horns and hooves are smeared with mustard oil. The body of the cow is <b>routed</b> with black <b>marking</b> with a mixture {{prepared}} from black ashes and mustard oil, using the stem of the Eri tree as the marker. The cows are also garlanded with the garlands made of gourd and brinjals. Before taking them off the cowshed the owner pays respects to them. While leading the cows to the river for bathing the cow herds sings the songs beating them lightly with the [...] "Dighalati" [...] plant.After taking away the cows from the cow shed the cow dungs are thrown away and the shed is cleaned. The old ropes(phaga) are replaced by new ones.|$|R
40|$|Pre-congestion {{notification}} (PCN) uses packet metering and marking {{to notify}} network boundaries {{when the current}} traffic load on some links of a PCN domain exceeds their configured admissible or supportable rates. This feedback is used for PCN-based admission control and flow termination within single PCN domains (edge-to-edge PCN). While admission control is rather well understood, flow termination is a new flow control function and useful especially in case of failures or flash crowds. Originally, only measured rate termination was proposed. It operates on ingress-egress aggregates between ingress and egress nodes of a PCN domain, terminates overload traffic in one shot, and requires single-path <b>routing.</b> We present <b>marked</b> flow termination as a new paradigm. It works for both ingress-egress aggregates and individual flows, terminates overload traffic gradually, and works well with multipath routing. The major contribution {{of this paper is}} the presentation of several marked flow termination methods, the study of their termination behavior, recommendations for their configuration, and the discussion of their benefits and shortcomings. A secondary contribution is the introduction of end-to-end PCN which moves the control from the boundaries of possibly several PCN domains to the end systems. Although end-to-end PCN has a trust problem in an Internet context, it might be useful for large corporate networks...|$|R
5000|$|AASHTO defines and {{specifies}} that alternate {{routes of}} the US Route system {{should have the}} following behavior:An [...] "Alternate Route" [...] shall be considered a route which starts {{at a point where}} it branches off from the main numbered route, may pass through certain cities and towns, and then connect back with the regular route some miles distant. Since it is the purpose of the U.S. numbered system to mark the best and shortest route available, an alternate route should be designated only where both routes are needed to accommodate the traffic demand, and when the alternate route has substantially the same geometric and structural design standards of the main <b>marked</b> <b>routing.</b> It is recommended that in case an alternate route is marked, that the shorter and better constructed route be given the regular number and the other section designated as the [...] "Alternate Route". It is further recommended that the Highway Department erect signs at the junction points of the regular and alternate routes giving the distance between the cities or points concerned... In no instance should an alternate routing be used for the purpose of keeping an obsolete section on the U.S. numbered system after a new routing has been constructed and available to traffic.|$|R
