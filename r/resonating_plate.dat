40|$|Inverse Chladni patterns, i. e., grains {{collecting}} at the antinodes of a <b>resonating</b> <b>plate,</b> {{are traditionally}} believed to occur {{only when the}} particles are small enough to be carried along by the ambient air. We now show—theoretically and numerically—that air currents {{are not the only}} mechanism leading to inverse patterns: When the acceleration of the <b>resonating</b> <b>plate</b> does not exceed g, particles will always roll to the antinodes, irrespective of their size, {{even in the absence of}} air. We also explain why this effect has hitherto escaped detection in standard Chladni experiment...|$|E
40|$|Novel {{methods are}} {{proposed}} {{to measure the}} modal properties of thin plates, such as free violin plates (prior to assembly), simply and inexpensively, by measuring certain changes when a small mass {{is added to the}} <b>resonating</b> <b>plate.</b> Iso-amplitude contours and mode shapes can easily be plotted. Modal mass, stiffness and damping can also be inferred. Underlying theory is developed, and experimental and numerical modelling methods of validation are briefly outlined...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this contribution, {{we present}} a {{symmetric}} arrangement of resonating plates for viscosity and mass density measurement. Regarding the oscillation mode, the design resembles that of micro machined tuning forks {{and is based on}} previously introduced <b>resonating</b> <b>plate</b> designs. It exhibits similar sensitivity to viscosity and mass density as the single plate resonators while having a lower damping when operated in the tuning fork mode. In this contribution we introduce the new design, present the results of FE simulations {{in order to determine the}} associated eigenmodes and examine the effects of the used actuation method on the sensor. Measurement results are presented which show the general dependence of the tuning fork design on viscosity and mass density as well as the differences exhibited by different modes, particularly the in phase and out of phase vibration modes of the plates...|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} all three basic designs shown here the anode of the valve is {{connected}} to a LC circuit needed to tune the plate circuit to resonance. Power may be coupled to the antenna via an additional inductive link as shown. More commonly modern circuits use a Pi network to <b>resonate</b> the <b>plate</b> circuit and match it to the antenna while also reducing harmonics.|$|R
50|$|One of Chladni's best-known {{achievements}} was {{inventing a}} technique to show the various modes of vibration of a rigid surface. When <b>resonating,</b> a <b>plate</b> or membrane is divided into regions that vibrate in opposite directions, bounded by lines where no vibration occurs (nodal lines). Chladni repeated the pioneering experiments of Robert Hooke who, on July 8, 1680, had observed the nodal patterns associated with the vibrations of glass plates. Hooke ran a violin bow {{along the edge of}} a plate covered with flour and saw the nodal patterns emerge.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary German {{photographer}} and philosopher Alexander Lauterwasser has brought cymatics into the 21st century using finely crafted crystal oscillators to <b>resonate</b> steel <b>plates</b> covered with fine sand and to vibrate small samples {{of water in}} Petri dishes. His first book, Water Sound Images, translated into English in 2006, features imagery of light reflecting off the surface of water set into motion by sound sources ranging from pure sine waves to music by Beethoven, Karlheinz Stockhausen, electroacoustic group Kymatik (who often record in ambisonic surround sound) and overtone singing. The resulting photographs of standing wave patterns are striking. Lauterwasser's book focused on creating detailed visual analogues of natural patterns ranging from the distribution of spots on a leopard to the geometric patterns found in plants and flowers, to the shapes of jellyfish and the intricate patterns found on the shell of a tortoise.|$|R
40|$|Granular {{materials}} can be encountered everywhere {{and are very}} important in industry. The first step in understanding these materials is normally to focus upon gravity and mechanical contact forces only. While this is a valid approximation when the particles are large, for smaller particles also the ambient air has a pronounced influence and {{must be taken into}} account. In this thesis we focus on particles where the “Stokesian” forces (drag, air pressure) and the “Newtonian” forces (from collisions and gravity) compete for dominance. Two examples that illustrate this in a particularly clear manner are the formation and coarsening of Faraday heaps and the appearance of regular and inverse Chladni patterns on a <b>resonating</b> <b>plate.</b> We study these systems by a hybrid Granular Dynamics – Computational Fluid Dynamics numerical code and compare the results with experiments. The simulations enable us to provide detailed explanations for these phenomena...|$|E
40|$|The {{coupling}} of acoustics {{and structural}} dynamics is of primary {{importance in the}} design of MEMS based microphones for use in liquid environments. A three-dimensional finite element study of acoustic-structural coupling is presented here for such a MEMS hydrophone system. The experimental system under consideration, currently under development at Boston University, consists of a horn to amplify incoming sound, a sub-micron thin plate resonator, and a Helmholtz resonator cavity to amplify the measurable response. The finite element results, which consist of steady state pressure fields in the fluid medium and steady state displacements of the <b>resonating</b> <b>plate,</b> compare favorably to experimental results. The effects of acoustic and structural resonances in each of the components of the system are explored, and it is shown that a nonuniform composite plate resonator provides a smoother broadband response in the frequency range of interest than a uniform plate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} the {{fundamental}} cause of anchor dissipation in Lamé- or wineglass-mode resonators {{and show that}} by carefully optimizing the resonator tether geometry low anchor losses can be achieved, {{making it possible to}} reach the intrinsic fxQ limit of the resonating material. Through analytical and finite element investigation, we demonstrate that the anchor loss is most significant when the flexural-mode resonance frequency of the tether is in sync with the Lamé-mode frequency of the <b>resonating</b> <b>plate.</b> This has a significant bearing on the design of Lamé-mode resonators with release holes or temperature-compensation trenches, where the modification of the resonator structure requires modification to the tether geometry to maintain a high Q. We verify the predicted results through experimental measurements and present an optimized design that exhibits a mechanical Q of 408, 270 for the fundamental Lamé mode at 41. 57 MHz. The fxQ for this device is 1. 7 x 1013, one of the highest values reported in silicon. I...|$|E
40|$|When {{very light}} {{particles}} are sprinkled on a <b>resonating</b> horizontal <b>plate,</b> inverse Chladni patterns are formed. Instead {{of going to}} the nodal lines of the plate, where they would form a standard Chladni pattern, the particles are dragged to the antinodes by the air currents induced by the vibration of the plate. Here we present a detailed picture of the mechanism using numerical simulations involving both the particles and the air. Surprisingly, the time-averaged Eulerian velocity, commonly used in these type of problems, does not explain the motion of the particles: it even has the opposite direction, towards the nodal lines. The key to the inverse Chladni patterning is found in the averaged velocity of a tracer particle moving along with the air: this Lagrangian velocity, averaged over a vibration cycle, is directed toward the antinodes. The Chladni plate thus provides a unique example of a system in which the Eulerian and Lagrangian velocities point in opposite direction...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} potential countermeasures for bone loss during long-term space missions in the hindquarter suspended rat, including partial weight bearing (surrogate for artificial gravity) episodic full weight bearing (2 hour/day full weight bearing) and treatment with the third generation bisphosphonate ibandronate (Roche). Graded mechanical loading was studied by housing the animals on a novel servo controlled force plate system which permitted the titration of mechanical force at varying frequency and amplitude and different levels of weight bearing. The force plate, which forms the cage floor, is a glass platform supported by an 18 " diameter speaker cone filled with expanding polyurethane foam. An infrared optical sensor attached to the speaker cone yields a voltage linearly related to vertical displacement of the glass platform. The dynamic force on the paw was computed as a product of the apparent mass of the animal on the platform at rest and the acceleration of the platform determined from the second derivative of the optical sensor output. The mass of the animal on the platform was varied by adjusting tension on the tether suspending the animal. Mechanical impact loading was titrated with the force <b>plate</b> <b>resonating</b> at different frequencies, including 3 Hz and 16 Hz...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIndustrial robots {{embedding}} multi-axis force sensors at the robot/environment interface presents numerous {{advantages in}} terms of safety, dexterity and collaborative perspectives. The key-point of these developments remains the availability of cheap but sufficiently precise multi-axis force sensors. This paper proposes a model-based approach to design a new alternative to commonly used strain gauge sensors. The principle of the device relies on pre-stress resonant composite plates where feedback control and measurement are achieved with piezoelectric transducers. The main originality of this work is that the force to be measured may present multi-axis components. Based on pre-stress and piezoelectric theories, a complete electromechanical model is proposed. This one is used during {{the design of a}} <b>resonating</b> composite Mindlin <b>plate,</b> embedding piezoelectric patches. It is shown that the effects of in-plane and out-of-plane external forces can be considered as pre-stress components. These ones, at the root of buckling phenomena, alter the stiffness of the structure and shift the plate resonance frequencies. Then, by solving the eigenvalue problem of the pre-stress vibrating structure, we can find the relationship between the natural frequencies of the structure and the externally applied multi-axis force. The proof of concept of this sensor is achieved on a case study. Finally, numerical results from both, home-made and commercial, finite element software demonstrates the interest of our approach to design integrated and inexpensive multi-axis force sensors solutions...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of cochlear implants, we have integrated a microdevice into {{a model of the}} auditory periphery with the goal of creating a microprocessor. We constructed an artificial peripheral auditory system using a hybrid model in which polyvinylidene difluoride was used as a piezoelectric sensor to convert mechanical stimuli into electric signals. To produce frequency selectivity, the slit on a stainless steel base plate was designed such that the local resonance frequency of the membrane over the slit reflected the transfer function. In the acoustic sensor, electric signals were generated based on the piezoelectric effect from local stress in the membrane. The electrodes on the <b>resonating</b> <b>plate</b> produced relatively large electric output signals. The signals were fed into a computer model that mimicked some functions of inner hair cells, inner hair cell–auditory nerve synapses, and auditory nerve fibers. In general, the responses of the model to pure-tone burst and complex stimuli accurately represented the discharge rates of high-spontaneous-rate auditory nerve fibers across a range of frequencies greater than 1 kHz and middle to high sound pressure levels. Thus, the model provides a tool to understand information processing in the peripheral auditory system and a basic design for connecting artificial acoustic sensors to the peripheral auditory nervous system. Finally, we discuss the need for stimulus control with an appropriate model of the auditory periphery based on auditory brainstem responses that were electrically evoked by different temporal pulse patterns with the same pulse number...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simulation study concerning {{the control of}} flexural vibration in a lightly damped thin plate, which is equipped with three sweeping TuneableVibration Absorbers and is excited by a rain on the roof broad frequency band stationary disturbance. The sweeping Tuneable Vibration Absorbers are semi-active mass-spring-dashpot systems whose stiffness and damping properties can be varied uniformly within given ranges. They are operated {{in such a way}} as their characteristic natural frequencies are continuously varied to control the observed flexural modes that resonate within given frequency bands. More specifically, in this study the three sweeping Tuneable Vibration Absorbers are operated asynchronously, each within one of three sequential frequency bands comprised between 20 - 120, 120 - 220, 220 - 320 Hz. The flexural vibration control effects produced by the three sweeping Tuneable Vibration Absorbers are compared to those produced by three classical Tuneable Vibration Absorbers, each set to control a flexural mode of the <b>plate</b> <b>resonating</b> in one of these three frequency bands. The study shows that the proposed sweeping Tuneable Vibration Absorbers outperform the classical Tuneable Vibration Absorbers and produce about 6, 5, 4 dB reduction of the panel flexural response in the three frequency bands of operation. Also, the study indicates that the sweeping Tuneable VibrationAbsorbers are robust to variations in the plate flexural response. For instance they still produce about 5. 1, 5. 3, 4. 6 dB reductions of the panel flexural response in the three frequency bands of operation when the panel is tensioned such that the flexural natural frequencies are shifted up from about 40 %, for the first resonance, to 7 %, for the tenth resonanc...|$|R
