40|$|This {{technical}} {{work plan}} (TWP) describes work activities {{to be performed}} by the Near-Field Environment Team. The objective of the work scope covered by this TWP is to generate Revision 03 of EBS Radionuclide Transport Abstraction, referred to herein as the radionuclide transport abstraction (<b>RTA)</b> <b>report.</b> The <b>RTA</b> <b>report</b> is being revised primarily to address condition reports (CRs), to address issues identified by the Independent Validation Review Team (IVRT), to address {{the potential impact of}} transport, aging, and disposal (TAD) canister design on transport models, and to ensure integration with other models that are closely associated with the <b>RTA</b> <b>report</b> and being developed or revised in other analysis/model reports in response to IVRT comments. The <b>RTA</b> <b>report</b> will be developed in accordance with the most current version of LP-SIII. 10 Q-BSC and will reflect current administrative procedures (LP- 3. 15 Q-BSC, ''Managing Technical Product Inputs''; LP-SIII. 2 Q-BSC, ''Qualification of Unqualified Data''; etc.), and will develop related Document Input Reference System (DIRS) reports and data qualifications as applicable in accordance with prevailing procedures. The <b>RTA</b> <b>report</b> consists of three models: the engineered barrier system (EBS) flow model, the EBS transport model, and the EBS-unsaturated zone (UZ) interface model. The flux-splitting submodel in the EBS flow model will change, so the EBS flow model will be validated again. The EBS transport model and validation of the model will be substantially revised in Revision 03 of the <b>RTA</b> <b>report,</b> which is the main subject of this TWP. The EBS-UZ interface model may be changed in Revision 03 of the <b>RTA</b> <b>report</b> due to changes in the conceptualization of the UZ transport abstraction model (a particle tracker transport model based on the discrete fracture transfer function will be used instead of the dual-continuum transport model previously used). Validation of the EBS-UZ interface model will be revised to be consistent with model changes...|$|E

Design—Data linkage study. Study population—Non-fatal injury victims of road traffic crashes in southern England who were admitted to hospital.

Results—An estimated 50 % of RTA injury admissions were included on the linked database. When assessing bias, admissions data were regarded as the "gold standard". The distributions of casualties by age, sex, and type of road user showed major differences between the admissions data and the police RTA injury data of comparable severity. The linked data showed smaller differences when compared with admissions data. For RTA serious injury admissions, the distributions by age and sex were approximately {{the same for the}} linked data compared with admissions data, and there were small but statistically significant differences between the distributions across road user group for the linked data compared with hospital admissions. Conclusion—These results suggest that investigators could be misinformed if they base their analysis solely on police RTA data, and that information derived from the linked database is less biased than that from police RTA data alone. A national linked dataset of road traffic crash data should be produced from hospital admissions and police RTA data for use by policymakers, planners and practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} relevant factors related to causes of Road Traffic Accidents, RTAs, among drivers in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, UAE. A questionnaire was developed and piloted in the UK and UAE. There were two versions of questionnaires distributed, one in Arabic language and the second one in English language. All respondents completed and signed a consent form which included information on their rights to withdraw from the study. Six hundred questionnaires were distributed in Abu Dhabi, with the help of two research assistants, from which 291 questionnaires from 185 males and 106 females were returned. The results have identified a number of factors as causes of road traffic accidents in Abu Dhabi and suggested ways to reduce the high <b>RTAs</b> <b>reported</b> in the country.

40|$|Background: Road traffic {{injuries}} (RTIs) are {{the main}} causes of death and disability in Iran. However, very few studies about the temporal variations of RTIs have been published to date. Objectives: This study was conducted to investigate the temporal pattern of RTIs in Iran in 2012. Materials and Methods: All road traffic accidents (<b>RTAs)</b> <b>reported</b> to traffic police during a one-year period (March 21, 2012 through March 21, 2013) were investigated after obtaining permission from the law enforcement force of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Distributions of RTAs were obtained for season, month, week, and hour scales, and for long holidays (more than one day) and the day prior to long holidays (DPLH). The final analysis was carried out using the Poisson regression model to calculate incidence rate ratios for RTIs. All analyses were conducted using STATA 13. 1 and Excel software; statistical significance was set at P < 0. 05. Results: A total of 452, 192 RTAs were examined. The estimated rate of all accidents was 219 per 10, 000 registered vehicles, or 595 per 100, 000 people. About 28...|$|R
40|$|Measuring the {{importance}} of regionalism in international trade is desirable but difficult. The number of regional trade agreements (<b>RTAs)</b> <b>reported</b> to the WTO or the proportion of world trade which is between countries in an RTA are frequently cited as evidence that regionalism is growing at an accelerating rate. This paper questions whether RTAs really {{are as important as}} the headline numbers suggest, or whether they just occupy an excessively large part of policymakers' and economic journalists' time. The main contributions are to analyse the number of RTAs and the share of world trade criteria in order to show why both are meaningless in the current world economy. The paper concludes that, although the extent of regionalism is difficult to measure and the desirability of individual RTAs is difficult to assess, the threat to the multilateral trading system {{does not appear to be}} as large as is often reported, because the long-term dynamics of RTAs lead either to state formation, which is important but rare, or to ineffectiveness, which is the fate of the vast majority of RTAs.

The tendency towards extreme outcomes (ie. economic union or negligible economic effects) explains why, despite the apparent proliferation of RTAs, regionalism has not posed a serious challenge to the world economy as the multilateral trading system has over the last sixty years gone from strength to strength. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) keep {{increasing}} {{every year}} in Ghana. In 2012 alone, 2, 249 Ghanaians lost their lives while 14, 169 got injured through RTA (Road Safety Commission 2012). The increasing population in Ghana coupled with the increasing vehicle ownership {{and the use of}} defective tyres, poor road user attitudes are among the reasons accounting for the alarming rate of RTAs in the country. This study examines the trends in relation to the factors contributing to the alarming rate of <b>RTA.</b> Accident <b>reports</b> collected from the National Road Safety Commission was used as the secondary data for the trend analysis. A total of 2, 271, 153 RTAs were recorded over the 21 year period and a very strong correlation (R =. 852 or 85 %) was found between the total number of accidents and their corresponding years. There is a positive correlation between the estimated total number of accidents and their corresponding years indicating the presence of a direct relationship.

This study assessed patterns of <b>RTA</b> injuries <b>reported</b> in Rawalpindi city using standard surveillance methods. All RTA injury patients presenting to emergency departments of 3 tertiary care facilities from July 2007 to June 2008 were included. RTA injuries (n = 19 828) accounted for 31. 7 % of all injuries. Among children aged 0 - 14 years females suffered twice as many RTA injuries as males (21. 3 % versus 11. 4 %), whereas this trend reversed for the age group 15 - 24 years (41. 9 % versus 21. 7 %). One-fifth of injuries were either fractures or concussion. Severity and outcome of injuries were worse for the age group 45 years and older. For every road traffic death in Rawalpindi city, 29 more people were hospitalized and 177 more received emergency department care.

We conducted a cross-sectional study including 893 casualties involved in fatal or non-fatal RTAs and admitted at the Emergency Room or the Forensic Institute from March to September 2012. Blood alcohol dosage (BAC) and urine drug screening were carried out, and results were linked with hospital and police crash report data. The mean BAC in positive cases indicated heavy drinking before the crash: drivers (1. 9 g/L), pedestrians (2. 1 g/L), passengers (1. 5 g/L). The prevalence of alcohol-impairment was significantly higher in drivers (41 %) and riders (27 %) compared to pedestrians (17 %) and passengers (13 %). Over 75 % of casualties that tested positive for alcohol had a BAC largely above the legal limit.

40|$|Although the {{deposition}} of crystalline silicon on a glass substrate has been pursued using hot wire {{chemical vapor deposition}} or plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition for applications in flat panel displays and solar cells, {{the process has been}} only partly successful because of the inevitable formation of an amorphous incubation layer on a glass substrate.

40|$|Introduction: Road {{accidents}} {{are associated with}} numerous problems each of which {{needs to be addressed}} separately [1]. Accidents, therefore, can be studied in terms of agent, host and environmental factors and epidemiologically classified into time, place and person distribution [2]. Objectives: 1. To assess the prevalence of RTAs coming to hospital and 2. To know the epidemiological factors related to RTAs and associated prevalence in hospital based study. Methodology : This cross sectional study was conducted at SMSR, Gr Noida, in 2012. The study group consisted of all the <b>RTA</b> victims <b>reporting</b> to casualty in the last one year. The victims of the accidents were interviewed on a pretested semi structured performa. Results: In that one year period total number of reported accident cases was 144. The age groups of the study subjects were between 13 - 65 years. Out of total study subjects, only 16 were female. Again out of the total accident cases 45 % were attended by police and of all injured, 45. 8 % were driver by occupation (7 % without driving license). Among these drivers, 11 % were not attentive during driving because of various reasons. Ambulance services had reached in 46. 5 % cases. Fracture was the most common type (60 %) of injury among all types of injuries. Among the applicable population only 33 % wore helmet or seat belts. Conclusions: Only half of the total accident cases were attended by police and again only half of them received ambulance services.

40|$|A {{new trend}} is emerging, seeking to {{recognize}} the benefits of and {{encourage the use of}} public transportation. In the past, public transit agencies have not directed much energy or focus at marketing, seeking to use limited funds elsewhere. “The common perception is that money spent on marketing would be better spent on transit systems themselves…over time, a sustained investment in marketing increases {{the number of people who}} use transit. Increased ridership leads to increased revenue, and ideally, an increase in service to match the new demand” (Arpi, 2009). Even as marketing gains importance in the public transit world, questions remain as to how to make effective marketing choices for the public transit market. This report explores public transit marketing, and its application to the San Luis Obispo Regional Transit Authority. The San Luis Obispo Regional Transit Authority (RTA) provides regional public transportation service throughout San Luis Obispo County. Case study interviews, conversations with RTA, and review of academic and professional sources have supplied information and guidance on these questions. An interview with RTA was conducted to establish goals and guiding research questions for the exploration of marketing. A literature review provided a context of the field, through professional, academic, news, and media pieces. The research questions were explored through case study examples, in the form of interviews with Intercity Transit (Olympia, WA) and Orange County Transportation Authority (Orange County, CA). Further analysis of 2011 ridership survey data provided an additional level of information to consider. The research methods resulted in a range of findings that are applicable to <b>RTA.</b> The <b>report</b> concludes with the following recommendations for marketing RTA: 1. Focus on consistent branding. 2. Establish a system of more detailed ridership information. 3. Identify segments and direct messages. 4. Further develop new technology and social media tools...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Percutaneous {{radiofrequency}} thermal ablation (<b>RTA)</b> was <b>reported</b> as {{an effective}} tool {{for the management of}} thyroid nodules (TNs). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of RTA and to establish whether they were treatment-related by comparison with a matched, untreated control group. Patients and Methods: The study population included 40 patients with compressive TNs: 22 had nontoxic TNs, and 18 had toxic TNs and were treated with methimazole. In all patients, a fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed to exclude a thyroid malignancy. Study Design: Twenty patients were treated with RTA (group A), and 20 others did not receive any treatment (group B). At baseline, age, gender, and TN features did not differ significantly between groups. All patients were clinically, biochemically, and morphologically evaluated at baseline and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Results: TN volume significantly decreased in group A (1. 8 ± 0. 3 ml at 12 months vs. 13. 3 ± 1. 8 ml at baseline; P < 0. 0001) and remained stable in group B [11. 7 ± 1. 5 ml at 12 months vs. 11. 2 ± 1. 5 ml at baseline; P = not significant (NS) ]. At 3 -, 6 -, and 12 -month evaluations, TN volume was significantly lower in group A than in group B (P < 0. 005). At the end of the follow-up, pressure symptoms were improved in all patients in group A but persisted unchanged in group B. In group A, hyperthyroidism completely recovered in 40 % and improved in 40 % of patients with toxic TNs, whereas it persisted in all patients with toxic TNs in group B. RTA was safe and well tolerated in all patients. Conclusions: RTA induced a marked TN volume shrinkage resulting in parallel improvement of pressure symptoms. In most patients with toxic TNs, hyperthyroidism significantly improved as well. RTA may represent a valid therapeutic approach in patients with TNs not receiving conventional treatments...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{report the}} effects of rapid thermal {{annealing}} (RTA) on the emission properties of highly uniform self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs) emitting at 1. 3 mu m grown on GaAs substrate by metal organic chemical vapor deposition. Postgrowth RTA experiments were performed under N- 2 flow at temperatures ranging from 600 to 900 degrees C for 30 s using GaAs proximity capping. Surprisingly, {{in spite of the}} capping, large blueshifts in the emission peak (up to about 380 meV at 850 degrees C) were observed (even at low annealing temperatures) along with enhanced integrated photoluminescence (PL) intensities. Moreover, pronounced peak broadenings occurred at low annealing temperatures (< 700 degrees C), indicating that RTA does not always cause peak narrowing, as is typically observed with traditional QDs with large inhomogeneous PL linewidths. The mechanism behind the large peak blueshift was studied and found to be attributed to the as-grown QDs with large size, which cause a larger dot-barrier interface and greater strain in and near the QD regions, thereby greatly promoting Ga-In intermixing across the interface during <b>RTA.</b> The results <b>reported</b> here demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} significantly shift the emission peak of the QDs by RTA without any additional procedures, even at lower annealing temperatures.

40|$|The {{switch from}} Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent {{infection}} to lytic replication {{is governed by}} two transcriptional regulators, Zta and <b>Rta.</b> We previously <b>reported</b> that the EBV protein encoded by the LF 2 gene binds to Rta and can inhibit Rta activity in reporter gene assays. We now report that LF 2 associates with Rta {{in the context of}} EBV-infected cells induced for lytic replication. LF 2 inhibition of Rta occurs in both epithelial and B cells, and this downregulation is promoter specific: LF 2 decreases Rta activation of the BALF 2, BMLF 1, and BMRF 1 promoters by 60 to 90 % but does not significantly decrease Rta activation of its own promoter (Rp). LF 2 decreases Rta activation by at least two mechanisms: decreased DNA binding and interference with transcriptional activation by the Rta acidic activation domain. Coexpression of LF 2 also specifically induces modification of Rta by the small ubiquitin-like modifiers SUMO 2 and SUMO 3. We further demonstrate that LF 2 overexpression blocks lytic activation in EBV-infected cells induced with Rta or Zta. Our results demonstrate that LF 2, a gene deleted from the EBV reference strain B 95 - 8, encodes a potent inhibitor of EBV replication, and they suggest that future studies of EBV replication need to account for the potential effects of LF 2 on Rta activity...|$|R
40|$|Lamivudine {{is a major}} drug {{approved}} for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Emergence of drug-resistant mutants with amino acid substitutions in the YMDD motif is a well-documented problem during long-term lamivudine therapy. Here we report a novel lamivudine-resistant strain of HBV with an intact YMDD motif, which included an amino acid substitution, rtA 181 T, in the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of HBV polymerase. The substitution also induced a unique amino acid substitution (W 172 L) in the overlapping hepatitis B surface (HBs) protein. The YMDD mutant strains were not detected even by using the sensitive peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping method. The detected nucleotide substitution was accompanied {{by the emergence of}} an additional nucleotide substitution that induced amino acid change (S 331 C) in the spacer domain. The rtA 181 T mutant strain displayed a threefold decrease in susceptibility to lamivudine in in vitro experiments in comparison with the wild type. In vivo analysis using human hepatocyte-chimeric mice confirmed the resistance of this mutant strain to lamivudine. We developed a method to detect this novel rtA 181 T mutation and a previously <b>reported</b> <b>rtA</b> 181 T mutation with the HBs stop codon using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR and identified one patient with the latter pattern among 40 patients with lamivudine resistance.

Research Question: What are different epidemiological determinants of RTA in western Nepal? Objective : To examine the factors associated with RTA. Study Design: Prospective observational. Setting: Study was performed in a tertiary healthcare delivery institute in western Nepal. Participants: 360 victims of <b>RTA</b> who <b>reported</b> to Manipal Teaching hospital in one year. Study Variables: Demographic, human, vehicular, environmental and time factors. Statistical analysis: Percentages, linear and logarithmic trend and Chi-square. Results : Most of the victims i. e. 147 (40. 83 &#x 0025;) were young (15 to 30 years); from low i. e. 114 (31. 66 &#x 0025;) and mid i. e. 198 (55 &#x 0025;) income families and were passengers i. e. 153 (42. 50 &#x 0025;) and pedestrians i. e. 105 (29. 16 &#x 0025;). Sever accidents leading to fatal outcome were associated with personal problems (P &# 60; 0. 01, &# 967; 2 - 8. 03), recent or on-day conflicts (P &# 60; 0. 001, &# 967; 2 - 18. 88) and some evidence of alcohol consumptions (P &# 60; 0. 001, &# 967; 2 - 30. 25). Increased prevalence of RTA was also noticed at beginning i. e. 198 (55 &#x 0025;) and end i. e. 69 (19. 16 &#x 0025;) of journey; in rainy and cloudy conditions (269 i. e. 74. 72 &#x 0025;) and in evening hours (3 to 7 p. m. 159 i. e. 44. 16 &#x 0025;). Out of 246 vehicles involved; 162 (65. 85 &#x 0025;) were old and ill maintained. The contributions of old vehicle to fatal injuries were 33 (50 &#x 0025;). Head injury was found in 156 (43. 33 &#x 0025;) cases and its associated case fatality rate was 90. 90 &#x 0025;.

We now show that this modification occurs at four lysines within the Rta activation domain (426, 446, 517, and 530) and that sumoylation of Rta is not essential for its repression. Coexpression studies demonstrated that Rta is sequestered to the extranuclear cytoskeleton {{in the presence of}} LF 2. We mapped the LF 2 binding site to Rta amino acids (aa) 476 to 519 and showed that LF 2 binding is critical for Rta relocalization and repression. The core of this binding site, Rta aa 500 to 526, confers LF 2 -mediated relocalization and repression onto the artificial transcription factor GAL 4 -VP 16. Mutational analysis of LF 2 provided further evidence that Rta redistribution is essential for repression. Rta localization changes during replication of the LF 2 -positive P 3 HR 1 genome, but not during replication of the LF 2 -negative B 95 - 8 genome. BLRF 2 protein expression was decreased and delayed in P 3 HR 1 cells compared with B 95 - 8 cells, consistent with reduced Rta activity. By contrast, BMRF 1 expression, regulated primarily by Zta, did not differ significantly between the two cell lines. Our results support a model in which LF 2 regulates EBV replication by binding to Rta and redistributing it out of the nucleus. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the prototypical gammaherpesvi...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The M 74 {{motorway}} extension, Glasgow, {{opened in}} June 2011. One justification for construction was {{an expectation that}} it would reduce road traffic accidents (RTAs) on local non-motorway roads. This study evaluated {{the impact of the}} extension on the number of RTAs, stratifying by accident severity. METHODS: Data for the period 1997 - 2014 were extracted from a UK database of <b>reported</b> <b>RTAs</b> involving a personal injury. RTA severity was defined by the level of injury: minor, severe or fatal. RTAs were assigned to (1) the local area surrounding the motorway extension, (2) a comparator area surrounding an existing motorway or (3) a control area elsewhere in the conurbation. Interrupted time-series regression with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) errors was used to determine longitudinal between-area differences in change in the number of RTAs, which might indicate an intervention effect. RESULTS: Glasgow and surrounding local authorities saw a 50. 6 % reduction in annual RTAs (n: 5901 to 2914) between 1997 and 2014. In the intervention area, the number of recorded RTAs decreased by 50. 7 % (n: 758 to 374), and that of fatal/severe RTAs by 57. 4 % (n: 129 to 55), with similar reductions in the comparator/control areas. The interrupted time-series analysis showed no significant between-area differences in temporal trends. The reduction of pedestrian casualties was attenuated in the intervention area relative to Glasgow and surrounding authorities. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in RTAs was not associated with the motorway extension. Our findings suggest that in planning future investment, it should not be taken for granted that new road infrastructure alone will reduce RTAs in local areas. Urbanisation is proceeding rapidly worldwide, and evidence of infrastructure changes is lacking; this novel study provides important findings for future developments.

40|$|The rare bone {{thickening}} disease osteopetrosis {{occurs in}} various forms, {{one of which}} is accompanied by renal tubular acidosis (RTA), and is known as Guibaud-Vainsel syndrome or marble brain disease. Clinical manifestations of this autosomal recessive syndrome comprise increased bone density, growth failure, intracerebral calcification, facial dysmorphism, mental retardation, and conductive hearing impairment. The most common cause is carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) deficiency. Several different loss of function mutations in CA 2, the gene encoding CAII, have been described. To date, there have been no exceptions to the finding of CAII deficiency in patients with coexistent osteopetrosis and RTA. Most often, the RTA is of mixed proximal and distal type, but kindreds are reported in which either distal or proximal <b>RTA</b> predominates. We <b>report</b> the molecular genetic investigation of two consanguineous kindreds where osteopetrosis and distal RTA (dRTA) were both manifest. One kindred harbours a novel homozygous frameshift alteration in CA 2. In the other, CAII levels were normal despite a similar clinical picture, and we excluded defects in CA 2. In this kindred, two separate recessive disorders are penetrant, each affecting a different, tissue specific subunit of the vacuolar proton pump (H+-ATPase), providing a highly unusual, novel genetic explanation for the coexistence of osteopetrosis and dRTA. The osteopetrosis {{is the result of a}} homozygous deletion in TCIRG 1, which encodes an osteoclast specific isoform of subunit a of the H+-ATPase, while the dRTA is associated with a homozygous mutation in ATP 6 V 1 B 1, encoding the kidney specific B 1 subunit of H+-ATPase. This kindred is exceptional firstly because the coinheritance of two rare recessive disorders has created a phenocopy of CAII deficiency, and secondly because these disorders affect two different subunits of the H+-ATPase that have opposite effects on bone density, but which have only recently been determined to possess tissue specific isoforms...|$|R

40|$|Renal {{involvement}} in Sjogren′s syndrome (SS) {{is not uncommon}} and may precede other complaints. Tubulointerstitial nephritis {{is the most common}} renal disease in SS and may lead to renal tubular acidosis (RTA), which in turn may cause osteomalacia. Nevertheless, osteomalacia rarely occurs as the first manifestation of a renal tubule disorder due to SS. We herewith describe a 43 -year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital for weakness, lumbago and inability to walk. X-ray of the long bones showed extensive demineralization of the bones. Laboratory investigations revealed chronic kidney disease with serum creatinine of 2. 3 mg/dL and creatinine clearance of 40 mL/min, hypokalemia (3. 2 mmol/L), hypophosphatemia (0. 4 mmol/L), hypocalcemia (2. 14 mmol/L) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (chlorine: 114 mmol/L; alkaline reserve: 14 mmol/L). The serum alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated. The serum levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D and 1, 25 -dihydroxy vitamin D were low and borderline low, respectively, and the parathyroid hormone level was 70 pg/L. Urinalysis showed inappropriate alkaline urine (urinary PH: 7), glycosuria with normal blood glucose, phosphaturia and uricosuria. These values indicated the presence of both distal and proximal <b>RTA.</b> Our patient <b>reported</b> dryness of the mouth and eyes and Schirmer′s test showed xerophthalmia. An accessory salivary gland biopsy showed changes corresponding to stage IV of Chisholm and Masson score. Kidney biopsy showed diffuse and severe tubulo-interstitial nephritis with dense lymphoplasmocyte infiltrates. Sicca syndrome and renal interstitial infiltrates indicated SS as the underlying cause of the RTA and osteomalacia. The patient received alkalinization, vitamin D (Sterogyl ®), calcium supplements and steroids in an initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day, tapered to 10 mg daily. The prognosis was favorable and the serum creatinine level was 1. 7 mg/dL, calcium was 2. 2 mmol/L and serum phosphate was 0. 9 mmol/L...|$|R
