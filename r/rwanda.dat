5|$|Much of {{the origins}} of the recent {{conflict}} in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo stems from the turmoil following the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, which then led to the Great Lakes refugee crisis. Within the largest refugee camps, beginning in Goma in Nord-Kivu, were Rwandan Hutu fighters, who were eventually organised into the Rassemblement Démocratique pour le <b>Rwanda,</b> who launched repeated attacks into <b>Rwanda.</b> <b>Rwanda</b> eventually backed Laurent-Désiré Kabila and his quickly organised Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo in invading Zaire, aiming to stop the attacks on <b>Rwanda</b> in the process of toppling Mobutu's government. When the militias rebelled, backed by <b>Rwanda,</b> the FAZ, weakened as is noted above, proved incapable of mastering the situation and preventing the overthrow of Mobutu in 1997.|$|E

5|$|<b>Rwanda</b> {{does not}} {{have a long history of}} written literature, but there is a strong oral {{tradition}} ranging from poetry to folk stories. Many of the country's moral values and details of history have been passed down through the generations. The most famous Rwandan literary figure was Alexis Kagame (1912–1981), who carried out and published research into oral traditions as well as writing his own poetry. The Rwandan Genocide resulted in the emergence of a literature of witness accounts, essays and fiction by a new generation of writers such as Benjamin Sehene. A number of films have been produced about the Rwandan Genocide, including the Golden Globe-nominated Hotel <b>Rwanda,</b> Shake Hands with the Devil, Sometimes in April, and Shooting Dogs, the last two having been filmed in <b>Rwanda</b> and having featured survivors as cast members.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Rwanda</b> Defence Force (RDF) is the {{national}} army of <b>Rwanda.</b> Largely composed of former Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) soldiers, it includes the <b>Rwanda</b> Land Force, <b>Rwanda</b> Air Force and specialised units. After the successful conquest {{of the country in}} 1994 {{in the aftermath of the}} Rwandan Genocide, the Rwandan Patriotic Front decided to split the RPF into a political division (which retained the RPF name) and the RDF, a military division which was to serve as the official army of the Rwandan state. Defence spending continues to represent an important share of {{the national}} budget, largely due to continuing security problems along the frontiers with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi and lingering concerns about Uganda's intentions towards its former ally. In 2010, the United Nations released a report accusing the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the First and Second Congo Wars, charges denied by the Rwandan government.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to <b>Rwanda,</b> in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in <b>Rwanda</b> to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{his policy}} of {{maintaining}} close relations with English speaking countries, Kagame sought membership of the Commonwealth of Nations, which was granted in 2009. <b>Rwanda</b> was only the second country, after Mozambique, to join the Commonwealth having never had colonial links to the British Empire.
