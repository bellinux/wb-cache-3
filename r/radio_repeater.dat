25|$|An amateur <b>radio</b> <b>repeater</b> is a {{specialty}} amateur radio station that extends {{the range of}} communications for other stations. A repeater uses a receiver tuned to one radio frequency and a transmitter tuned to another radio frequency. Other stations using a repeater station transmit on one frequency but listen for signals on the other frequency. If a repeater station is in a favorable location, such as on a tall tower, {{the top of a}} tall building, or on a mountaintop, stations that otherwise {{would not be able to}} communicate with each other can each use the repeater and establish two-way communications.|$|E
2500|$|The short {{broadcast}} tower {{on the top}} of {{the mountain}} transmits two non-commercial stations: television station WGTV TV 8, and weather radio station KEC80 on 162.55MHz.

[...] W266BW FM 101.1 now has a permit as well. Atop the tower also sits the W4BOC Amateur <b>Radio</b> <b>repeater</b> which operates on a frequency on 146.760.|$|E

5000|$|... ===Radio repeater=== [...] This is used {{to extend}} the range of {{coverage}} of a radio signal. The history of <b>radio</b> relay <b>repeaters</b> began in 1898 from the publication by Johann Mattausch in Austrian Journal Zeitschrift für Electrotechnik (v. 16,35 - 36). But his proposal [...] "Translator" [...] was primitive and not suitable for use. The first relay system with <b>radio</b> <b>repeaters,</b> which really functioned, was that invented in 1899 by Emile Guarini-Foresio. On the 27th of May, 1899 Belgian student E. Guarini-Foresio has submitted an application forpatent of invention to the Belgian patent department, first having described a device of the <b>radio</b> relay <b>repeater.</b> The patent confirms the E. Guarini priority and allows considering this date as the official birthday of radio relay communication.|$|R

CITS {{launched}} four HABET flights, HABET-1 through HABET-4, 1993-1994, from the rural home of Ralph Wallio, W0RPK, in north central Warren County. HABET-1 was a traffic load test on a packet <b>radio</b> digital <b>repeater</b> which was developed to fly on STS (this payload did not fly on STS but it began the process that resulted in ARISS today). Flights HABET-2, -3 and -4 included GPS telemetry, Amateur <b>Radio</b> <b>repeaters</b> (23>70 cm) and numerous experiments.|$|R

In June 2010, the U.S. Forest Service planned to remove the tower as part of a project to construct a <b>radio</b> <b>repeater</b> on Barton Knob. The <b>radio</b> <b>repeater</b> was installed by May 2012 adjacent to the tower, which was not removed.|$|E
