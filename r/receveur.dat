Some of the Irish convicts had been Transported to Australia for political crimes or social rebellion in Ireland, so the authorities were suspicious of the minority religion {{for the first three}} decades of settlement. It was therefore the crew of the French explorer La Pérouse who conducted the first Catholic ceremony on Australian soil in 1788 – the burial of Father Louis <b>Receveur,</b> a Franciscan monk, who died while the ships were at anchor at Botany Bay, while on a mission to explore the Pacific.|$|E
6000|$|Kinnaird {{absolutely}} {{declined to}} give up the name of his informant, but, acting on the strength of the postscript, which had been read but not shown to him, started for Paris with [...] "the great unknown." [...] Some days after their arrival, and while Kinnaird was a guest of the Duke, the man was arrested, and discovered to be one Nicholle or Marinet, who had been appointed <b>receveur</b> under the restored government of Louis XVIII., but during the Cent jours had fled to Belgium, retaining the funds he had amassed during his term of office. Kinnaird regarded this action of the French Government as a breach of faith, and in a [...] "Memorial" [...] to the French Chamber of Peers, and his Letter, maintained that the Duke's postscript implied a promise of a safe conduct for Marinet to and from Paris to Brussels. The Duke, on the other hand, was equally positive (see his letter to Lord Liverpool, May 30, 1818) [...] "that he never intended to have any negotiations with anybody." [...] Kinnaird was a [...] "dog with a bad name," [...] He had been accused (see his Letter to the Earl of Liverpool, 1816, p. 16) of [...] "the promulgation of dangerous opinions," [...] and of intimacy [...] "with persons suspected." [...] The Duke speaks of him as [...] "the friend of Revolutionists"! It is evident that he held the dangerous doctrine that a promise to a rogue is a promise, and that the authorities took a different view of the ethics of the situation. It is clear, too, that the Duke's postscript was ambiguous, but that it did not warrant the assumption that if Marinet went to Paris he should be protected. The air was full of plots. The great Duke despised and was inclined to ignore the pistol or the dagger of the assassin; but he believed that [...] "mischief was afoot," [...] and that [...] "great personages" [...] might or might not be responsible. He was beset by difficulties at every turn, and would have been more than mortal if he had put too favourable a construction on the scruples, or condoned the imprudence of a [...] "friend of Revolutionists."] ...|$|E

50|$|Until {{the late}} 17th century, tax {{collectors}} were called <b>receveurs.</b> In 1680, {{the system of}} the Ferme Générale was established, a franchised customs and excise operation in which individuals bought the right to collect the taille on behalf of the king, through 6-years adjudications (certain taxes like the aides and the gabelle had been farmed out in this way as early as 1604). The major tax collectors in that system were known as the fermiers généraux (farmers-general in English).|$|R
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to reform the fiscal system, new {{administrative}} divisions were created in the 16th century. The Recettes générales, commonly known as généralités and overseen in the beginning by <b>receveurs</b> généraux or généraux conseillers (royal tax collectors), were initially only taxation districts. Their role steadily increased and by the mid 17th century, the généralités were {{under the authority of}} an intendant, and they became a vehicle for the expansion of royal power in matters of justice, taxation, and policing. By the outbreak of the Revolution, there were 36 généralités; the last two were created as recently as 1784.|$|R

5000|$|Taxation districts {{had gone}} {{through a variety of}} {{mutations}} from the 14th century on. Before the 14th century, oversight of the collection of royal taxes fell generally to the baillis and sénéchaux in their circumscriptions. Reforms in the 14th and 15th centuries saw France's royal financial administration run by two financial boards which worked in a collegial manner: the four Généraux des finances (also called [...] "général conseiller" [...] or [...] "receveur général" [...] ) oversaw the collection of taxes (taille, aides, etc.) by tax-collecting agents (<b>receveurs)</b> and the four Trésoriers de France (Treasurers) oversaw revenues from royal lands (the [...] "domaine royal").|$|R
50|$|The Provost was {{assisted}} by twenty-four conseillers de ville, a city council, who were {{chosen by the}} Provost and echevins, when there was an opening. Beneath the Provost and echevins there were numerous municipal officials, all selected from the bourgeoisie; two procureurs, three <b>receveurs,</b> a greffier, ten huissiers, a Master of Bridges, a Commissaire of the Quais, fourteen guardians of the city gates, and the Governor of the clock tower. Most of {{the positions of the}} Bureau of the City had to be purchased with a large sum of money, but once acquired, many of them could be held for life. Each of the sixteen quarters or neighborhoods of the city also had its own administrator, called a quarternier, who had eight deputies, called dizainiers. These positions had small salaries but were prestigious and came with generous tax exemptions.|$|R
50|$|Over time, {{the role}} of the baillages would be greatly {{extended}} as extensions of royal power, administration and justice. With the office of Great Seneschal vacant after 1191, the bailies became stationary and established themselves as powerful officials superior to provosts. A bailie's district included about half a dozen provostships. When appeals were instituted by the Crown, appeal of provost judgments, formerly impossible, now lay with the bailie. Moreover, in the 14th century, provosts no longer were in charge of collecting domainal revenues, except in farmed provostships, having instead yielded this responsibility to royal receivers (<b>receveurs</b> royaux). Raising local army contingents (ban and arrière-ban) also passed to bailies. Provosts therefore retained the sole function of inferior judges over vassals with original jurisdiction concurrent with bailies over claims against nobles and actions reserved for royal courts (cas royaux). This followed a precedent established in the chief feudal courts in the 13th and 14th centuries in which summary provostship suits were distinguished from solemn bailliary sessions.|$|R

5000|$|He {{was the son}} of Michel IV Bégon (1604 - 17 August 1683, Blois) and {{his wife}} Claude Viart. The Bégon family was an {{established}} court family, producing as many justices as finance ministers (two great-uncles were avocat and conseiller to the présidial of Blois, and Michel V's father and grandfather were <b>receveurs</b> des tailles). Michel V devient became garde des Sceaux of the présidial of Blois (1662) then president of the tribunal (1667). He only entered the naval administration late in life, aged around 40, when Colbert made him treasurer of the marine du Levant at Toulon (1677) : this was the start of a happy career. Bégon later left the shores of the Mediterranean for north-western France, becoming commissaire général de la marine at Brest (24 November 1680) then at Le Havre (1681). He crossed the Atlantic to take up office as intendant of the Windward Islands (1 May 1682 - 24 November 1684). On his return from the Antilles, he won a new post with the Levant fleet which he had awaited since 4 November 1684, the date of his nomination to the post of intendant des galères at Marseille.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{oversight}} and weakening of provostships occurred when, {{to monitor their}} performance and curtail abuses, the Crown established itinerant justices known as bailies (bailli, plural baillis, from which is derived the English word [...] "Bailiff") to hear complaints against them. With the office of Great Seneschal vacant after 1191, the bailies became stationary and established themselves as powerful officials superior to provosts. A bailie's district is called a bailliary (bailliage) and included about half a dozen provostships (prévôtés). When previously impossible appeals of provost judgements were instituted by the Crown, that competence of appeal {{was given to the}} bailie. Moreover, in the 14th century, provosts no longer were in charge of collecting domainal revenues, except in farmed provostships, having instead yielded this responsibility to [...] "royal receivers" [...] (<b>receveurs</b> royaux). Raising local army contingents (ban, draft; and arrière-ban, reserve) also passed to bailies. Provosts therefore retained the sole function of inferior judges over vassals with original jurisdiction concurrent with bailies over claims against noblemen and actions reserved for royal courts (cas royaux, royal cases). This followed a precedent established in the chief feudal courts in the 13th and 14th centuries in which summary provostship suits were distinct-guished from solemn bailliary sessions (assises).|$|R
40|$|The unorthodox {{decision}} {{taken in}} 1850 to oblige the Treasury Offices {{to accept the}} bank notes of the Bank of France, {{in spite of the}} repeal of the forced currency in 1848, or in other words the maintaining of the legal tender of the note in relation to the Treasury Offices (Introduction), would be understandable with the following hypothesis. This unorthodox decision would indirectly come down to recovery the tax in cash by the Bank of France (I- 1), and would make possible to the Bank of France, thanks to the income of the tax, to stabilize its reserve that is structurally unstable (I- 2), even if it must be necessary to raise the bank rate in the event of important withdrawals realized by the Treasury (I- 3). In this way, the Bank of France would finance in cash, thanks to this aid from the State, the needs of the economy (II- 2), while the maintaining of the legal tender in relation to the Treasury Offices, would make possible to finance the public Deficit exclusively with its notes (II- 1). This monetary policy carried out by the Bank of France in 1850, would have taken as pattern, the monetary policy fulfilled by the Bank of England, through the 1844 's Banking Charter Act of Peel (II- 3). La décision "hétérodoxe" prise en 1850 d'obliger les <b>Receveurs</b> généraux à recevoir le billet de la Banque de France, malgré l'abrogation du cours forcé, autrement dit le maintien "hétérodoxe" du cours légal du billet de la BF auprès des Caisses publiques (Introduction), s'expliquerait par l'hypothèse suivante: cette décision "hétérodoxe" se ramènerait indirectement à un recouvrement en espèces de l'impot par la BF (I- 1) et permettrait alors à la BF de stabiliser son Encaisse, structurellement aléatoire, grace au produit de la fiscalité (I- 2), quitte à élever le taux de l'escompte en cas de retraits significatifs opérés par le Trésor (I- 3). La BF financerait alors en espèces grace à cette aide de l'Etat, le crédit à l'écnomie (II- 2), alors que le maintien du cours légal auprès des Caisses publiques, lui aurait permis de financer le déficit public par "création monétaire" (II- 1). Cette politique monétaire mise en oeuvre par la BF dès 1850, aurait pris comme modèle celle mise en oeuvre en 1844 par la Banque d'Angleterre, sous le nom d'Act de Peel...|$|R
