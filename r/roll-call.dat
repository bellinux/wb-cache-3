5|$|On December 7, 1969, Kinne was {{not present}} for a routine 5 p.m. <b>roll-call</b> at the Ixtapalapan prison where she was serving her sentence, but her absence was not officially noted until she also {{failed to show up}} at a second <b>roll-call</b> later that evening. The news of her {{disappearance}} was not reported to Mexico City police until 2 a.m. the following morning. A manhunt was then arranged, initially focusing on the northern Mexican states due to authorities' belief that Kinne may have been heading for the last known whereabouts of a former inmate to whom she had grown close while they were in prison together, but also encompassing country-wide transport hubs and eventually circling back to the Mexico City area. American authorities, including the FBI, were also alerted of Mexican authorities' belief that Kinne may have been attempting to work her way back into her native country, but the FBI noted that it was unlikely to have jurisdiction in the case.|$|E
5|$|During sessions, {{members may}} speak after being called {{on by the}} President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due {{to the need for}} translation, and the {{politics}} of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a <b>roll-call</b> ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of <b>roll-call</b> votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.|$|E

2500|$|Turkey has {{repeatedly}} {{been criticized for}} poor prison conditions and in particular for not solving the problem of overcrowding. Following the 1980 Turkish coup d'état political prisoners tried in military courts were held in military prisons and were thus subjected to military discipline. Prisoners were obliged to participate in daily <b>roll-calls,</b> the singing of marches and drills in the open air. In particular, Diyarbakır and Mamak Military Prisons (the latter in Ankara) became notorious for the routine beatings which accompanied attempts to enforce military discipline among civilians. In addition, so-called [...] "inaugural-beatings" [...] had been institutionalized in almost all prisons in Turkey.|$|R
40|$|Public {{majorities}} {{have supported}} several gay rights policies for some time, yet Congress’s {{response has been}} limited. We document and analyze this tension through dyadic analysis of the opinion-vote relationship on 23 <b>roll-calls</b> between 1993 and 2010, revealing a nuanced picture of responsiveness and incongruence. While opinion influences white male Democrats, black lawmakers and white female Democratic lawmakers generally support gay rights and Re-publicans consistently oppose them, regardless of constituent preferences. Moreover, changes in constituent opinion typically fail to engender vote changes. This analysis suggests a mix of member persuasion and replacement {{may be necessary to}} achieve LGB rights gains in Congress. Word count: 6426...|$|R

He was recaptured after his earlier escape from prison along with Fritz Suhren and Hans Pflaum (see above). During trial, {{he was convicted of}} beating women with truncheons, belts and fists, starving them for missing the quota, keeping them outside in very long <b>roll-calls,</b> and sending them to the gas chamber for (what he called) [...] "being useless", as well as of kicking, at least one Czech female inmate, causing death. He also encouraged his guards to do the same. Opitz received a death sentence, which was carried out on January 26, 1948.|$|R

25|$|The House {{reserves}} <b>roll-call</b> {{votes for}} the most formal matters, as a roll call of all 435 representatives takes quite some time; normally, members vote by using an electronic device.

Members insert a voting ID card and can change their votes during the last five minutes if they choose; in addition, paper ballots are used on some occasions—yea indicated by green and nay by red. One member can not cast a proxy vote for another. Congressional votes are recorded on an online database.|$|E

5000|$|While {{reception}} was warm, reviewers tussled {{with the}} task of pigeonholing the sound of the album, <b>roll-calling</b> contemporary and influential bands and works. Rock Sound reviewer Dan Morgan illustrated the album's sound: [...] "polyrhythmic Fugazi structures merge delicately with angelic post rock and the sort of even-handed electronica that 65daysofstatic might produce if their parents forced them onto Ritalin." [...] Likewise, Alexander Tudor of Drowned in Sound questioned the categorisation of the band and their sound: [...] "Does the grey area between (guitar-led, crescendo-prone) post-rock and instrumental electronica actually have a name we can agree on… or is this what Simon Reynolds had in mind when he coined post-rock, in the mid-Nineties?" [...] Structurally, he compares the album to Mogwai's Mr. Beast, Björk and Meanwhile, back in Communist Russia.... Writing for the NME, Matt Warwick describes the track [...] "Florida Logic" [...] as [...] "Mars Volta-inspired".|$|R

25|$|The {{elections}} for the Second Confederate Congress {{took place at the}} time of the regular state and local elections held in each state. As a result, their dates ranged from May 1863 and May 1864. Only Virginia's on May 28, 1863 was held before the reverses at Vicksburg and Gettysburg, and it had a turnover of forty percent. The war was going badly for the South during the other elections, and citizens were adversely affected by conscription, taxes, food supply and the economy generally. Unlike the earlier personality contests over most enthusiastic support of secession in the elections to the First Congress, Congressmen facing re-election had <b>roll-call</b> voting records that they had to defend. In Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas, the state delegations saw a turnover of half or more. At the time of elections in each state, just over forty percent of the House was occupied or disrupted by Union forces, yet the fragmentary Congressional results from army and refugee camps were accepted as representative of the majority of residents in each state, a practice that one historian has called delusional.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{is based}} on a true story. [...] "Albert R.N." [...] was a dummy {{constructed}} in Marlag O, the prisoner of war camp in northern Germany for naval officers. The head was sculpted by war artist John Worsley (1919 - 2000), the body by Lieutenant Bob Staines RNVR, and Lieutenant-Commander Tony Bentley-Buckle devised a mechanism enabling Albert’s eyes to blink and move, adding realism to the dummy. [...] "Albert" [...] was used as a stand-in for a head count while a prisoner escaped and was used on two separate occasions. In the first attempt Lieutenant William [...] "Blondie" [...] Mewes RNVR escaped from the camp shower block, and the skilfull use of [...] "Albert" [...] during <b>roll-calls</b> gave him four days head start before a missing PoW was reported.

5|$|At {{any given}} time, Treblinka I had a {{workforce}} of 1,000–2,000 prisoners, {{most of whom}} worked 12- to 14-hour shifts in the large quarry and later also harvested wood from the nearby forest as fuel for the open-air crematoria in Treblinka II. There were German, Czech and French Jews among them, as well as Poles captured in łapankas, farmers unable to deliver food requisitions, hostages trapped by chance, and people who attempted to harbour Jews outside the Jewish ghettos or who performed restricted actions without permits. Beginning in July 1942, Jews and non-Jews were separated. Women mainly worked in the sorting barracks, where they repaired and cleaned military clothing delivered by freight trains, {{while most of the}} men worked at the gravel mine. There were no work uniforms, and inmates who lost their own shoes were forced to go barefoot or scavenge them from dead prisoners. Water was rationed, and punishments were regularly delivered at <b>roll-calls.</b> From December 1943 the inmates were no longer carrying any specific sentences. The camp operated officially until 23 July 1944, when the imminent arrival of Soviet forces led to its abandonment.|$|R
