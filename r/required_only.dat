5|$|Of the 50 B-52Bs built, 27 {{were capable}} of {{carrying}} a reconnaissance pod as RB-52Bs (the crew was increased to eight in these aircraft). The 300pound (136kg) pod contained radio receivers, a combination of K-36, K-38, and T-11 cameras, and two operators on downward-firing ejection seats. The pod <b>required</b> <b>only</b> four hours to install.|$|E
5|$|Sadat's {{strategy}} {{was designed to}} achieve political success without needing a comprehensive military victory, and hence, and {{in view of the}} Egyptian military's marked inferiority to the Israeli Defense Forces, this <b>required</b> <b>only</b> a limited war.|$|E
5|$|A {{by-election}} {{need not}} be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A by-election is <b>required</b> <b>only</b> if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight <b>required</b> <b>only</b> a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E
5|$|Woods {{decided the}} jury for the Broadway run would employ some jury service {{rules of the}} New York courts. One such rule was the payment of jurors three dollars per day for their participation, which meant the {{selected}} audience members profited by at least 25 cents after subtracting the ticket price. Another was that only men could serve on a jury, although Woods made exceptions, for example at the performance Keller attended. He later loosened the rule to allow women jurors at matinee performances twice a week. Unlike a normal criminal trial, verdicts <b>required</b> <b>only</b> a majority vote rather than unanimity.|$|E
5|$|Commanded by Brigadier Charles Hilary Vaughan Pritchard, the 2nd Parachute Brigade {{formed in}} 1942 and was {{assigned}} to the 1st Airborne Division. It comprised three parachute battalions, with their own artillery and engineer support. Although the brigade had not been involved in the division's operations in Sicily, it took part in Operation Slapstick, the landing at Taranto in Italy. At the end of 1943, when the 1st Airborne Division returned to the United Kingdom, the brigade remained behind fighting in the Italian Campaign. Since then, the brigade had taken part in patrols probing German lines, and the battles at Cassino and along the Sangro river at the Bernhardt Line. Previously, their only parachute mission had been Operation Hasty, which <b>required</b> <b>only</b> sixty men from the brigade.|$|E

5|$|Developed in 1939, the Mk. XIV started {{replacing}} the First World War-era Course Setting Bomb Sight in 1942. The Mk. XIV was essentially an automated {{version of the}} Course Setting sight, using a mechanical computer to update the sights in real-time as conditions changed. The Mk. XIV <b>required</b> <b>only</b> 10 seconds of straight flight before the drop and automatically accounted for shallow climbs and dives. More importantly, the Mk. XIV sighting unit was {{much smaller than the}} Course Setting sight, which allowed it to contain a gyro stabilization platform. This kept the sight pointed at the target even as the bomber manoeuvred, dramatically increasing its accuracy and ease of sighting.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 29 April, a party of Noongar broke into a Fremantle store to steal flour and were shot at by the {{caretaker}} Peter Chidlow. Domjum, a brother of Yagan, was badly injured and died in jail a few days later. The rest of the party moved from Fremantle to Preston Point, where Yagan reportedly vowed vengeance for the death. Between 50 and 60 Noongar gathered at Bull Creek, where they met a party of settlers who were loading carts with provisions. Later that day, the group ambushed the lead cart, killing two settlers, Tom and John Velvick. Tribal law <b>required</b> <b>only</b> a single death for vengeance. Some historians have speculated that the Velvicks were targeted because they had previously been convicted for assaulting Aboriginal people and coloured seamen. Alexandra Hasluck has also argued that stealing provisions was an important motive in the attack, but this has been refuted elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland's {{absence from}} the top flight lasted six years. The club came within one game of {{promotion}} back to the First Division in the 1962–63 season. Sunderland <b>required</b> <b>only</b> a draw in their final game against promotion rivals Chelsea, who had another game left to play after this match, to secure promotion. However, they were defeated, and Chelsea won their last game 7–0 to clinch promotion, finishing ahead of Sunderland on goal average. After the close call in the previous season, the club was promoted to Division One in 1964 after finishing in second place. Sunderland beat Charlton Athletic {{in the final stages}} of the season, where they clinched promotion with a game to spare. At the end of the decade, they were again relegated to the Second Division after finishing 21st.|$|E

5|$|The American Stud Book, the {{registration}} book for American Thoroughbreds, was not founded until 1873, much {{later than the}} General Stud Book, and the rules for registration <b>required</b> <b>only</b> that a horse have five generations of ancestors in the American Stud Book or other national stud books, unlike the General Stud Book rules. In addition, many breeding records were destroyed during the American Civil War, as fighting during that conflict took place in noted American Thoroughbred breeding centers. The result was that most American Thoroughbreds in 1913 were unable to show an unblemished pedigree according to the General Stud Book rules. Adding to the problem {{was the fact that}} American horses were beginning to win the big horse races in England, starting with Iroquois, who won the 1881 Epsom Derby.|$|E
5|$|The Han-era Chinese used {{bronze and}} iron {{to make a}} range of weapons, culinary tools, carpenters' tools and {{domestic}} wares. A significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools. The three-legged iron seed drill, invented by the 2nd century BC, enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand. The heavy moldboard iron plow, also invented during the Han dynasty, <b>required</b> <b>only</b> one man to control it, two oxen to pull it. It had three plowshares, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45,730 m2 (11.3 acres) of land in a single day.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy {{in the late}} 3rd and early 4th centuries. By the 4th century, the thin and lightweight tubed vaulting had become a vaulting technique in its own right, rather than simply serving as a permanent centering for concrete. It was used in early Christian buildings in Italy. Arranging these terracotta tubes in a continuous spiral created a dome that was not strong enough for very large spans, but <b>required</b> <b>only</b> minimal centering and formwork. The later dome of the Baptistry of Neon in Ravenna is an example.|$|E

5|$|Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak {{were hired}} to {{supervise}} the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron {{said he had to}} pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson (who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift power loader exoskeletons, which <b>required</b> <b>only</b> three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model could not stand on its own, requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model, a stunt man standing behind it would move the arms and legs.|$|E
5|$|In 1648, the Fronde insurrection {{broke out}} in Paris, {{prompted}} by high taxes, increased food prices and disease. The Parlement of Paris, the Regency government of Anne of Austria and rebellious noble factions fought for several years {{to take control of}} the city and wider power. On 26 August, during the period known as the First Fronde, Anne ordered the arrest of some of the leaders of the Parlement of Paris; violence flared as a result, and the 27 August became known as another Day of the Barricades. The governor of the Bastille loaded and readied his guns to fire on the Hôtel de Ville, controlled by the parliament, although the decision was eventually taken not to shoot. Barricades were erected across the city and the royal government fled in September, leaving a garrison of 22 men behind in the Bastille. On 11 January 1649, the Fronde decided to take the Bastille, giving the task to Elbeuf, one of their leaders. Elbeuf's attack <b>required</b> <b>only</b> a token effort: five or six shots were fired at the Bastille, before it promptly surrendered on the 13 January. Pierre Broussel, one of the Fronde leaders, appointed his son as the governor and the Fronde retained it even after the ceasefire that March.|$|E
