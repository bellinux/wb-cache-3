40|$|The Expedite Departure Path (EDP) is a {{decision}} support tool being developed at NASA Ames Research Center aimed at providing Terminal Area Radar Approach Control (TRACON) Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs) with pertinent departure traffic loading and scheduling information and <b>radar</b> controllers with <b>advisories</b> for tactical control of terminal area departure traffic. One of the proposed features of EDP is to provide departure controllers {{with the ability to}} perform unrestricted climbs where procedures typically restrict departures below incoming arrival traffic streams. The potential benefits of this feature include reductions in time-to-climb, fuel burn, and aircraft noise impact to the surrounding communities. This paper focuses on the issue of unrestricted climb in congested terminal areas and describes the modeling and simulation of such climbs. First, flight data of departures in TRACON airspace were analyzed to estimate the level of uncertainties in climb trajectory prediction. Second, the existing Trajectory Synthesizer (TS) module of the Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS) was modified to generate trajectories that closely model actual aircraft climb profiles and terminal airspace procedures. Third, an algorithm was applied to predict conflicts between trajectories of departure and arrival aircraft and to determine if an unrestricted climb is advisable. Controller-in-theloop simulations were performed to validate the feasibility of the algorithm and evaluate human factors. Lastly, a future application of a conflict probability estimation method for EDP was examined...|$|R
40|$|Air traffic {{management}} decision support tools {{have shown the}} capability to increase arrival traffic throughput of congested Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities without significantly impacting air traffic controller workload. NASA Ames Research Center, {{in cooperation with the}} Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), is playing a leading role in identifying air {{traffic management}} problems, developing and prototyping concepts, and performing field trials for such decision support tools. The Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS) is a suite of decision support tools developed by NASA Ames Research Center, and is included in the FAA's Free Flight Program. This paper describes the concept and development plan of the Expedite Departure Path (EDP) component of CTAS. EDP is a decision support tool aimed at providing TRACON Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs) with pertinent departure traffic loading and scheduling information, and <b>radar</b> controllers with <b>advisories</b> for tactical control of TRACON departure traffic. EDP employs the CTAS trajectory synthesis routine to provide conflict-free altitude, speed and heading advisories. These advisories will assist the TRACON departure controller in efficiently sequencing, spacing and merging departure aircraft into the en route traffic flow. The anticipated benefits of EDP include a reduction in airborne delay for departure aircraft, reduced fuel burn and reduced noise impact due to expedited climb trajectories. EDP will eventually share information with both surface and arrival decision support tools to form an integrated decision support system capable of planning, coordinating and executing highly efficient terminal airspace operations...|$|R

During July she saved five downed aviators, including one who was rescued from deep within North Vietnam by the ship's helicopter crew. In August the ship was stationed in a positive identification and <b>radar</b> <b>advisory</b> zone (PIRAZ) in the Gulf of Tonkin to help protect American ships from enemy aircraft. Before she was relieved, she had checked over 15,000 aircraft. During this duty she also rescued seven pilots whose planes had gone down during strikes against enemy targets.

5000|$|Upon {{detachment}} from [...] "Seahawk," [...] Whipple stopped at Subic Bay for maintenance prior to proceeding to the Gulf of Tonkin {{to relieve the}} destroyer [...] as Positive Identification and <b>Radar</b> <b>Advisory</b> Zone (PIRAZ) ship. After taking up station on 28 February, Whipple performed escort duties besides conducting her regular patrols. Her PIRAZ work during this time was light, as reduced air activity over North Vietnam was accomplished by low visibility and a cancellation of many scheduled flights. While Whipple operated in company with the destroyer [...] on PIRAZ duties, the escort ship's electronic [...] "eyes" [...] maintained the air [...] "picture" [...] for the northern half of the Gulf of Tonkin. The destroyer escort next took up plane-guard duties for the carrier [...] before providing gunfire support in Military Region 1 for the South Vietnamese Army's 3d Division. Whipple conducted 52 missions and expended 2,361 rounds of 5-inch ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|From 28 January to 10 February, Agerholm {{served as}} escort for the {{destroyer}} leader [...] in the positive identification <b>radar</b> <b>advisory</b> zone (PIRAZ).

Anchored in the shallow restricted water with the Viet Cong less than 6000 yd away, Agerholm was vulnerable to enemy fire, underwater swimmers, and mines. On 25 March, the destroyer first fired both RAP and conventional ammunition into the RSSZ with great accuracy. On 13 April, she retired from NGFS to visit Singapore, Hong Kong, and Kaohsiang. Agerholm returned to the gunline on 15 May, conducting shore bombardments off Phan Thiet until 23 May. She then reported to the cruiser [...] on PIRAZ station in the Gulf of Tonkin for her last assignment. On 10 June, the warship was relieved and ordered to Subic Bay to prepare for her return voyage. After port visits to Brisbane, Australia, and Auckland, New Zealand Agerholm set a course for San Diego, where she arrived on 24 July.|$|E
5000|$|On 30 January 1969, Stribling put to sea from Mayport, Florida, to {{make her}} second voyage to the Far East. Heading via the Panama Canal, San Diego, and Pearl Harbor, the {{destroyer}} made for Yokosuka, Japan, and then operations {{off the coast of}} Vietnam. Stribling participated in [...] "Sea Dragon" [...] and [...] "Market Time" [...] operations, and her duties also included bombardments on the gunline, search and rescue missions usually for downed carrier pilots, and Positive Identification <b>Radar</b> <b>Advisory</b> Zone (PIRAZ) duty. The latter assignment involved riding [...] "shotgun" [...] for larger PIRAZ ships armed with more sophisticated radar and target designation systems. That summer, Stribling plane-guarded for the carriers operating on [...] "Yankee Station" [...] in the Gulf of Tonkin. When not operating in the combat zone, she put into Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and Subic Bay in the Philippines for repairs after a collision with a barge being towed by RVN tug during a nighttime underway replenishment [...] On 2 August 1969, Stribling cleared the combat zone to return home. On her way, she stopped at Kure and Yokosuka, Japan; Pearl Harbor; San Diego; Acapulco Mexico, and Panama. On 17 September 1969, she reentered Mayport.|$|E
5000|$|Three days later, {{she arrived}} on {{station in the}} Tonkin Gulf and, on 8 June, took over {{positive}} identification <b>radar</b> <b>advisory</b> zone (PIRAZ) duties from [...] In that capacity, Wainwright maintained constant radar and visual surveillance of the gulf and adjoining coasts {{for the purpose of}} identifying all aircraft in the zone and vectoring defensive forces to the interception of any possible airborne enemy intruders. Because of the relative immobility necessary to those duties, she also served as a reference point to guide American strike aircraft to their targets ashore. Since her duties afforded her a continual picture of the events occurring in the air over the zone, she also served as a base for search and rescue (SAR) helicopters. During that first line period, one (SAR) helicopter crashed Wainwrights flight deck area; but the damage proved to be minimal, and the destroyer was able to resume full-scale flight operations the following day. Damage to the superstructure of the helicopter storage compartment consisted of a gash provided by a helicopter blade. The helicopter was ordered to be pushed over the side {{as a result of the}} damage to it.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 February 1967, the {{destroyer}} departed Mayport {{on her way}} to her first and only deployment to the Vietnam war zone. Steaming via the Panama Canal and Hawaii, she arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 14 March. Four days later, she got underway for the coast of Vietnam. On her first tour in the Gulf of Tonkin, Allen M. Sumner served as [...] "shotgun" [...] (screening ship) for [...] while the nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser served on positive identification <b>radar</b> <b>advisory</b> zone duty in the gulf. She was relieved of that assignment on 5 April to participate in Operation Seadragon, the interdiction of communist waterborne logistics operations. That assignment lasted until 11 April, when she joined the screen of the aircraft carrier [...] for a voyage to Sasebo, Japan. She remained at Sasebo from 15 to 22 April before heading back to the Gulf of Tonkin again in company with Hancock. Upon her return to Vietnamese waters, Allen M.

5000|$|The {{destroyer}} {{arrived back}} in Long Beach on 1 June {{and began a}} three-month restricted availability in the naval shipyard. She completed the availability early in October and began sea trials and training in the southern California operating area. Early in December, Turner Joy reentered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard to be readied for her redeployment to the western Pacific. On 26 January 1971, she stood out of Long Beach {{on her way to}} rejoin the 7th Fleet. She entered Subic Bay on 16 February and went into drydock for several days while both her propellers were replaced. On 5 March, she exited Subic Bay for a tour of naval gunfire support duty along the Vietnamese coast. That assignment - carried out along the I Corps-zone coastline near Danang - ended on 2 April; and she headed for [...] "Yankee Station" [...] and two weeks of plane guard duty with the TF 77 aircraft carriers. Following a five-day port call at Subic Bay, Turner Joy took up position at [...] "Yankee Station" [...] again on 27 April - this time as escort for the PIRAZ (positive identification and <b>radar</b> <b>advisory</b> zone) ship. She performed that duty until 30 April; then, after three days evading a typhoon, she moved in close to the I Corps shoreline to resume gunfire support duties.|$|E
5000|$|The {{summer of}} 1966 {{was spent in}} {{training}} and orienting midshipmen in the tactics and operations involved in the modern nuclear Navy. After a period of leave and upkeep in the fall, Long Beach sailed 7 November 1966 from Long Beach for the Far East. During this initial cruise, the cruiser served primarily as the Positive Identification <b>Radar</b> <b>Advisory</b> Zone (PIRAZ) unit in the northern Gulf of Tonkin. As such, her main responsibility was to [...] "sanitize" [...] returning US air strikes, ensuring that no enemy aircraft were attempting to evade identification by hiding amongst returning friendlies. Additionally, the ship provided support for an on-board Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopter unit. During this tour, Long Beach was responsible for directing the downing of one Soviet-made An-2 'Colt' aircraft that was attempting to engage South Vietnamese naval units. The shoot-down was executed by an F-4 Phantom II fighter {{under the control of}} a Long Beach Air Intercept Controller (AIC). The cruiser returned to Long Beach, California, in July 1967. In 1968 the ship was redeployed to the Gulf of Tonkin, shooting down a MiG fighter plane with a RIM-8 Talos missile 23 May 1968, at a range of 65 miles. In June of the same year, she downed another MIG, this one at 61 miles. She also directed other MIG kills by American fighters. She was the first ship to down an aircraft using SAMs in the Vietnam war and the incidents were not immediately publicized because it was feared the use of SAMs would undermine the 1968 Paris Peace Accords. Long Beach received a Navy Unit Commendation for the actions.|$|E
5000|$|Terrier was {{initially}} deployed on two converted Baltimore-class cruisers (CAG), with conversions completed in 1955-56. Further conversions of six s (CLG) ( [...] and [...] classes), redesign of the Farragut class as guided missile [...] "frigates" [...] (DLG), {{and development of}} the [...] DDGs resulted in the completion of numerous additional guided missile ships deploying all three systems in 1959-1962. Also completed during this period was the nuclear-powered , with two Terrier and one Talos launchers, plus an ASROC anti-submarine launcher the World War II conversions lacked. The converted World War II cruisers up to this point retained one or two main battery turrets for shore bombardment. However, in 1962-1964 three additional Baltimore and [...] cruisers were more extensively converted as the [...] These had two Talos and two Tartar launchers plus ASROC and two 5-inch (127 mm) guns for self-defense, and were primarily built to get greater numbers of Talos launchers deployed. Of all these types, only the Farragut DLGs were selected as the design basis for further production, although their [...] successors were significantly larger (5,670 tons standard versus 4,150 tons standard) due to a second Terrier launcher and greater endurance. An economical crew size compared with World War II conversions was probably a factor, as the Leahys required a crew of only 377 versus 1,200 for the Cleveland-class conversions. Through 1980, the ten Farraguts were joined by four additional classes and two one-off ships for a total of 36 guided missile frigates, eight of them nuclear-powered (DLGN). In 1975 the Farraguts were reclassified as guided missile destroyers (DDG) due to their small size, and the remaining DLG/DLGN ships became guided missile cruisers (CG/CGN). The World War II conversions were gradually retired 1970-1980; in 1980 the Talos missile was withdrawn as a cost-saving measure and the Albanys were decommissioned. Long Beach had her Talos launcher removed in a refit shortly thereafter; the deck space was used for Harpoon missiles. Around this time the Terrier ships were upgraded with the RIM-67 Standard ER missile. The guided missile frigates and cruisers served in the Cold War and the Vietnam War; off Vietnam they performed shore bombardment and shot down enemy aircraft or, as Positive Identification <b>Radar</b> <b>Advisory</b> Zone (PIRAZ) ships, guided fighters to intercept enemy aircraft. By 1995 the former guided missile frigates were replaced by the s and s.|$|E
