At Wolfe’s suggestion, Tolman compares the results of the taste testing on the theory that the murderer, either tense before committing murder or shaken afterwards, would be unable to accurately determine the dishes. Of the participants, Jerome Berin’s test is the lowest-scoring, and based on Wolfe’s theory he is subsequently charged with murder.

50|$|The first TV lifts were {{launched}} {{on the market}} in the USA {{at the beginning of the}} 1950s. As a consequence of the fact that the cathode-ray televisions of the time were usually heavy and bulky, the first TV lifts were also very large and bulky constructions which required quiet a large amount of space for their installation. At the beginning, there were primarily TV lifts which lifted the cathode-ray television upwards out of a piece of furniture or a <b>room</b> <b>divider.</b> The vertical ceiling lifts first came onto the scene in the mid-1970s as a result of the television manufacturing industry by that time having developed cathode-ray televisions which were flatter and lighter. At the beginning of the new millennium in the year 2000, plasma display televisions were introduced which meant that more compact systems (flat-lift devices) became available on the market. After the lighter LED televisions replaced the plasma screen technology in 2011, the technology could be refined even further.|$|E
50|$|The ‘textile market’ {{comprises}} {{many different}} applications and requirements. The intended {{use of the}} fabric {{is the most important}} starting point to identify exactly what’s needed to produce a specific end-product. A ‘textile’ product may vary from natural yarns for garments, through to synthetic fibres for flags and banners. A ‘textile product’ can be a wall mounted banner, a stand-alone pop-up banner, a beach flag, country flag or company flag. It can be a carpet, back-lit frame, curtain, <b>room</b> <b>divider,</b> building wrap, bed cover, a garment and much more. The predominant textile media used in visual communication is a polyester based fabric. In the USA, nylon is often used for flags. In northern Europe, polyspun material has been the choice of fabric for traditional flag printing. In today’s market, a woven or knitted polyester is the de facto standard. This differs from the predominant coated vinyl or pvc media used in the sign and display industry.The production process needs to fit requirements for the type of ink: high energy sublimation (also known as disperse direct), low energy sublimation (dye-sub), acid, reactive and pigment. In turn, the type of ink chemistry needs to fit requirements for the media (such as polyester, nylon, cotton, silk). Based on the media and ink combination, the choice comes for infra-red fixation, heat-press sublimation or steaming. The structure of the fabric also needs attention, for example whether it is woven, non-woven or knitted.|$|E

40|$|In my project, I {{researched}} the boundary {{in the field}} of architecture. I suppose that setting the boundary is the most primitive architectural activity. It is often said that the beginning of architecture was constructing the roof to prevent from rain. When the roof is constructed the boundary between inside and outside is generated. Setting boundary in space is, so to say making order in disorder or giving concreteness to abstraction. A boundary divides the space into two. However, the divided two spaces share a boundary. Therefore I think when the idea of “dividing” comes up we can always find a sense of “sharing” as well. As a starting point I believed that when the notion of “connecting” is added to boundary there could be a new value in the space. I surveyed how the idea of setting boundary in architecture has been changed through history. In my research I reached the concept of “gradational boundary” which divides a space but also connects the space at the same time. Furthermore I designed a piece of furniture which functions both as a shelf and as a <b>room</b> <b>divider</b> based on this concept...|$|E
40|$|Energy-efficient {{designs in}} clothing, {{interior}} architecture and furnishings were evaluated (a) to assess consumers’ {{attitudes toward the}} designs, (b) to compare acceptability levels of participants who were knowledgeable in the home energy field with those who were less knowledgeable and (c) to determine if consumers had a preference for using housing, clothing or furnishings in meeting their thermal comfort needs. Four designs generated by the University of Tennessee-Energy Design competition were evaluated: a leisure outfit, a lounging dress, a water-storage collector (<b>room</b> <b>divider</b> and coffee tables) and a solar waterbed. Rogers and Shoemaker’s perceived attributes of innovations model (relative advantage, compatibility and complexity) was utilized as a theoretical basis. The semantic differential scale and the gaming technique were selected as measurement / scaling devices. The underlying constructs of the design evaluations were determined by factor analysis and did correspond to Rogers and Shoemaker’s attributes of compatibility and complexity. The relative advantage attribute was strongly economic {{for all of the}} designs except the leisure outfit. All of the designs were acceptable to survey participants on the basis of mean ratings. No significant differences in acceptability levels of participants who were knowledgeable in the home energy field and those who were less knowledgeable were found using the t-test.

40|$|I did {{my degree}} project {{together}} with Universeum AB. The project had the work title: children’s {{world and the}} aim were to give children between 3 - 8 years old {{a place that was}} especially made for them. With their interests and needs in mind the area should trigger play but also learning through a well planned pedagogical environment. I did this project because I thought this was an excellent opportunity to really practise my new gained skills I had learned during my two years in CCD (Child Culture Design). It also gave me the opportunity to actually see how well my knowledge was working when it was put to the test, and I did learn a lot from this. Together with a crew of 6 people I developed and designed the area. I used the computer to sketch/design and make drawings for the carpenter. As the deadline for this project was too tight to do any of my usual design process I was forced not to do any analysis. I only used my intuition and earlier knowledge that I have gained during my time at CCD. It worked out really well and the result was Jobbis. What I did in the project was to help out with the overall design and illustrations. My main focus was to design the city area, containing lab, building site and food store. I created a wall and <b>room</b> <b>divider</b> called Triangeln (the Triangle) that separated the three areas in the city and formed calm and noise-free zone where the children can play and explore.

40|$|In their book, ???The Smart Entrepreneur???, Clarysse and Kiefer {{claim that}} ???Patents are {{particularly}} important when your business is not close to market, because the exclusivity afforded by a solid patent can buy you some time by preventing competitors from encroaching on your idea while you develop applications. ??? (Clarysse, Kiefer, 2011, p. 127) The UK Design Council {{on the other hand}} suggests to ???Approach patenting with caution. Multinational cover is expensive and premature filing can do more harm than good??? (www. designcouncil. org. uk). Clarysse and Kiefer admit that ??????a patent suit can cost $ 10 - 15 million and drag on for several years??? (Clarysse, Kiefer, 2011, p. 93). This beckons the question what is the best IP strategy for a design-led start-up. Is a patent an effective means for start-ups to overcome competition? Clarysse, Kiefer also explain how the lack of complimentary assets can hinder an entrepreneur???s market entry, and how ???bottlenecks??? in the value chain can be by-passed through focusing on niche markets (Clarysse, Kiefer, 2011, p. 72 ff). Here Clarysse, Kiefer expand on Teece???s understanding of complimentary assets, which are thought of as the ???additional resources and capabilities needed to bring a technology product to market??? (Clarysse / Kiefer, 2011, p. 80). Back in 1986 Teece analysed how these assets can increase or limit a company???s chance to succeed in the industry. David Teece has further defined appropriability as ???the environmental factors??? that govern an innovator???s ability to capture the profits generated by an innovation. ??? (Teece, 1986, p. 287) He refers to IP {{as one of the most}} important factors in relation to appropriability. The paper proposed here seeks to discuss both appropriability and complimentary assets in order to establish a clear understanding of the differences between both, and how complimentary assets relate to a venture???s appropriability regime. This study focuses in particular on small-scale design-led start-up businesses, which have limited access to complimentary assets due to the development stage that they are in. The paper discusses the question to what extent access to exclusive IP may strengthen a company???s appropriability regime and thus compensate for the absence of various complimentary assets. In line with Grounded Theory principles as introduced by Strauss / Corbin, the applicant has conducted a range of qualitative case studies of award winning British designs including the so-called Seaboard, a novel music instrument, which uses an innovative pressure-sensitive touch interface, Cupris, a smartphone-enabled clinical device that transmits data between patients and healthcare practitioners, Yossarian Lives, a metaphor-based database search engine, Arctica, a highly sustainable ventilation system, KwickScreen, a portable, retractable, <b>room</b> <b>divider</b> that provides privacy solutions in hospitals, Squeeze, an inflatable hoodie that can be blown up to give wearers a comforting squeeze when they are feeling anxious, and Concrete Canvas, a flexible cement impregnated fabric that hardens on hydration to form a thin, durable water proof and fire proof concrete layer. Interviews with inventors of these technologies have revealed that designer-entrepreneurs commonly perceive patents and other exclusive IP as a necessary prerequisite for succeeding with their design business development. At the same time the design entrepreneurs have frequently expressed concerns about the costs involved in registering IP, and about the fact that their chances of successfully defending their patents in court may be limited due to the lack of available funds. Teece alongside others has also pointed out the ease, with which established businesses can often circumvent patents. This suggests that secrecy may be preferable over patenting as a means of securing exclusivity. However, a start-up business will always find it difficult to establish credentials, whilst sustaining secrecy about the particulars of the invention involved. How to attract equity investors, for example, if the technological details of an invention cannot be revealed? This paper will introduce an assessment chart that has been designed to map out complimentary assets, which ought to be at the focus of attention of design-led start-up businesses. It will further show how the use of the chart can help to measure a businesses strengths and weaknesses with regards to individual complementary assets, and how the results of the assessment can inform the designer-entrepreneur to what degree filing a patent may or may not be advisable. To critically evaluate the results of the interviews mentioned above, an additional series of interviews has been conducted with subject experts such as business coaches, economists, venture capitalists and other researchers in the field...|$|E
