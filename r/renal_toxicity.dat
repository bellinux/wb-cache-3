5|$|Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is a {{recreational}} drug with euphoriant and stimulant properties. The effects produced by BZP {{are comparable to}} those produced by amphetamine. Adverse effects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis, <b>renal</b> <b>toxicity</b> and seizures. No deaths have been reported following a sole ingestion of BZP, {{although there have been}} at least two deaths from the combination of BZP and MDMA.

5|$|Metallic gallium is not toxic. However, {{exposure}} to gallium halide complexes {{can result in}} acute toxicity.

In lower doses, soluble gallium is tolerated well and does not accumulate as a poison, instead being excreted mostly through urine. Excretion of gallium occurs in two phases: the first phase has a biological half-life of one hour while the second has a biological half-life of twenty-five hours.|$|E

Here we review the adverse renal effects associated with a selection of currently approved targeted cancer therapies, directed to EGFR, HER 2, BRAF, MEK, ALK, PD 1 /PDL 1, CTLA- 4, and novel agents targeted to VEGF/R and TKIs. In summary, electrolyte disorders, renal impairment and hypertension are the most commonly reported events.

5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially <b>renal)</b> <b>toxicity,</b> methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} {{there may be}} an {{asymptomatic}} phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged, in some cases blood sugar levels will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to <b>renal</b> <b>toxicity</b> or renal failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of breath and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.|$|E
5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is <b>renal</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E

5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane begins {{immediately after}} the onset of exposure. The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable {{to one or more}} metabolites produced by O-demethylation of methoxyflurane. Significant products of this catabolic process include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), and inorganic fluoride. Methoxyflurane nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of methoxyflurane to fluoride and DCAA. This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared. It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxic—it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite. The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane biotransformation compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this combination is more toxic than fluoride alone. This may explain why fluoride formation from methoxyflurane is associated with nephrotoxicity, while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as enflurane and sevoflurane) is not. Furthermore, the concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal <b>renal</b> <b>toxicity.</b>|$|E

At a lipid/AMB ratio of 40, the three lipidic formulations were not toxic for renal cells but were less effective against C. albicans than AMB; however, DSPC-AMB, which contained 50 % unbound AMB, was more effective against C. albicans than DPCC-AMB or DMPC-AMB, containing 0 and 13 % unbound AMB, respectively. At a lipid/AMB ratio of 1, the antifungal effects of L-AMB and AMB were similar, whatever the phospholipid used, but only DMPC-AMB remained highly protective against AMB <b>renal</b> cell <b>toxicity,</b> despite the presence of the same amount of unbound AMB (50 %) in DMPC-AMB and DPPC-AMB. We conclude that the in vitro activities and <b>renal</b> cell <b>toxicities</b> of different L-AMB formulations are influenced by the phospholipid type and the lipid/AMB ratio. The optimal ratio depends on the phospholipid itself. At a lipid/AMB ratio of 40, the antifungal activity depends mainly on the amount of unbound AMB in the formulation.

The present treatment standards for ovarian cancer are based on the association of debulking surgery with platinum-based chemotherapy.

We previously described that the 2 -h administration of intraoperative IP cisplatin did not reach satisfactory concentrations. In the present study, we present the results of a pharmacokinetic analysis performed after two consecutive 1 -h IP 30 mg/l cisplatin administrations. Twenty-seven patients with advanced epithelial cancer classified FIGO stage IIIC were included in the study. Blood and IP samples were taken over a 24 -h period, during and after IP treatment. Both total and ultrafiltered (Uf) platinum (Pt) concentration levels were analyzed. Biological and clinical toxicities were also recorded. With this strategy, IP Pt concentrations stayed above the target concentration (10 mg/l) for a satisfactory length of time. The serum Pt concentrations were higher than those observed with the "one-bath" protocol and they induced the occurrence of recoverable <b>renal</b> <b>toxicities</b> (3 grade 1, 7 grade 2 and 4 grade 3).
