40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{develop a}} theory for the {{dynamics}} in entangled solutions of associating polymers with many stickers per chain. The stickers strongly associate and form large aggregates that control both the equilibrium {{structure of the}} system and its dynamics. The association results in formation of micelles that separate macroscopically yielding a <b>reversible</b> <b>gel</b> phase of interconnected, closely packed micelles. We identify two mechanisms for stress relaxation: (a) polymer chain diffusion and (b) positional rearrangements of the micelles, and predict that the second process is exponentially slower than chain diffusion. Hence, a polymer chain may diffuse through many of its gyration radii during the terminal stress relaxation time. We predict an exponentially strong concentration dependence of the micellar gel viscosity typically involving one or more anomalous regimes where the viscosity is decreasing with concentration. We also show that the chain self-diffusion constant decreases exponentially with concentration in the strongly entangled regime (entangled spacers connecting the stickers). 1...|$|E

Around the main lipid phase transition temperature, DPPC double bilayers exhibit large increases in the water layer separating the bilayers and the upper bilayer roughness. The inclusion of low amounts of cholesterol reduced the swelling of the water layer between the bilayers and the upper bilayer roughness and progressively widened the temperature range over which swelling occurs. Results from asymmetric bilayers are also reported. A higher amount of cholesterol in the lower bilayer induces a smaller swelling of the water layer between the bilayers than in the symmetric case.

Scleral and conjunctival tissues were excised at 0. 5,  1,  2,  4, or 24  hours after the injection and mitomycin C concentrations in these tissues were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The concentration over time was approximated to a single exponential curve, and initial mitomycin C concentrations, time constants, and half life values were determined. Finally, the areas under the curves (AUCs) between 0. 5  and 24  hours were calculated.  RESULTS—The mitomycin C concentrations in the target tissues were dose dependent and decreased rapidly over 24  hours.

40|$|Neurofilaments freshly {{isolated}} from bovine spinal cord form a <b>reversible</b> <b>gel</b> in vitro, consisting of nearly parallel and interlinked filaments organized in bundles. This phenomenon is obtained above a critical neurofilament concentration and is highly sensitive to denaturation. No gelation occurs with neurofilaments reconstituted from urea-solubilized subunits. The {{velocity of the}} gelation kinetics, optimum at a slightly acidic pH, is inhibited by low and high ionic strength and activated by millimolar concentrations of Mg 2 + and other bivalent cations. No protein other than the purified neurofilament preparation itself (80 - 95 % neurofilament triplet) {{is necessary for the}} formation of a gel. However, purified cytoskeletal proteins from microtubules and neurofilaments influence the viscosity of the native preparation. These observations suggest a reticulation in vitro between neurofilaments, dependent upon a fragile conformation of the polymers and possibly mediated through the high-Mr neurofilament subunits (200 kDa and 150 kDa). The significance of these results is discussed with regard to the inter-neurofilament cross-bridging in situ involving the 200 kDa subunit described by Hirokawa, Glicksman & Willard [(1984) J.

In this work we describe sensor concepts using piezoresistive pressure sensor chips with integrated analyte-sensitive hydrogels, that enable inexpensive and robust biochemical sensors which are miniaturizable and in-line capable. Biocompatible hydrogels were developed and tested for pH- and glucose-monitoring during the chemical and biochemical processes. For that, monomer mixtures based on hydroxypropyl methacrylate HPMA, 2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate DMAEMA, tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate TEGDMA and ethylene glycol EG were photo-polymerized. By means of carbodiimide chemistry, glucose oxidase was bound to the pH-sensitive HPMA/DMAEMA/TEGDMA/EG hydrogel squares causing the glucose-sensitivity.

40|$|The {{release of}} a model drug substance, methylparaben, was studied in matrix tablets {{composed}} of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) batches of the USP 2208 grade that had different chemical compositions. It was found that chemically heterogeneous HPMC batches with longer sections of low substituted regions and lower hydroxypropoxy content facilitated the formation of <b>reversible</b> <b>gel</b> structures at a temperature as low as 37 degrees C. Most importantly, these structures were shown to affect {{the release of the}} drug from matrix tablets, where the drug release decreased with increased heterogeneity and a difference in T 80 values of 7 h was observed between the compositions. This could be explained by the much lower erosion rate of the heterogeneous HPMC batches, which decreased the drug release rate and also released the drug with a more diffusion based release mechanism compared to the less heterogeneous batches. It can therefore be concluded that the drug release from matrix tablets is very sensitive to variations in the chemical heterogeneity of HPMC. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Agar is a {{hydrophilic}} colloid {{formed by}} polysaccharides, whose ability to form <b>reversible</b> <b>gels</b> simply by cooling hot aqueous solutions {{is the most}} important property and can be regarded as the prototype and model for all gelling systems. In this paper the evolution of the gelation process of agar obtained from algae of the species Gelidium robustum, using the photopyroelectric technique is reported. It is shown that thermal effusivity increase when the agar is cooled, reaching a maximum value around 37 °C. The increase in thermal effusivity can be related to the increasing of the bondings in the gel as temperature decreases, reaching the maximum at the gelation point. The decrease of the thermal effusivity at lower temperature could be due to the syneresis process involving a gradual release of water after gelation...|$|R

As a result, we delimit the region of thermodynamic stability of the fluid. We find that for a large region of the phase diagram the Wertheim theory is able to give a quantitative description of the system. For higher densities our simulations show that the system is crystallizing into a BCC structure. Finally we study the relaxation dynamics of the system by means of the density and temperature dependences of the diffusion coefficient. We show that there exists a density range where the system passes reversibly from a gel to a fluid upon both heating and cooling, encountering neither demixing nor phase separation...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to increase cohesion of a PSA by including silica nanoparticles. The silica nanoparticles form reversible agglomerates and bind polymer molecules by adsorption. The adhesive becomes a <b>reversible</b> <b>gel.</b> Under pressure over a time suitable for bond formation the PSA can still flow due the time scale for the reversible silica physical gel to respond. The effect of cohesion on PSA bond formation can be characterised using modulated force thermomechanical analysis. The change in relaxation of a nano-silica filler on an elastomer, analogous to a PSA, has been measured using stress relaxation. The mastercurve measurements on bond strength (peel test) and viscoelastic cohesion (modulated force thermomechanical analysis) demonstrates the contribution of a bulk property (cohesion) to a surface property (bond strength) and reveals the mechanism of PSA. The PSA mechanism leads to the concept that an adhesive bond can be enhanced through formation of physical crosslinks by the high surface to volume ratio of a nanofiller. PSA-silica nanocomposites enable better control of adhesive bond formation and subsequent removal than adventitious chemical gelation during polymerization...|$|E

The second part of the research is a study of spherulitic growth rate in blends of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and a compatibilizer. Using time-lapse photomicroscopy it was found that addition of small amount of compatibilizer can enhance the growth rate of iPP. Similar results were obtained with chemically modified compatibilizers. The enhancement is explained in terms of partial miscibility between iPP and compatibilizers.

These materials are well suited for photonic applications, however a certain quenching of the photoluminescence (PL) intensity is observed in these structures. This PL quenching is mainly attributed to the energy transfer mechanisms that result from the close contact of the nanoparticles in the network. Here, we demonstrate the formation of a novel aerogel material with non-quenching PL behaviour by non-classical, <b>reversible</b> <b>gel</b> formation from tetrazole capped silica encapsulated QDs. Monitoring of the gelation/degelation by optical spectroscopy showed that the optical properties of the nanocrystals could be preserved in the 3 D network since no spectral shifts and lifetime shortening, which {{can be attributed to the}} coupling between QDs, are observed in the gels as compared to the original colloidal solutions. In comparison with other QD-silica monoliths, QDs in our gels are homogeneously distributed with a distinct and controllable distance.

40|$|The {{proposal}} {{was to establish}} a general principle with which polymer gels can specifically recognize a target molecule and reversibly change their affinity to the target by orders of magnitude. The polymer consists of two species of monomers, each having a different role. The majority monomer species control network density and make the gel to swell and shrink reversibly {{in response to an}} environmental change such as temperature. The minority monomers come into sufficient proximity to each other when the supporting gel shrinks and then they become able to function as multi-group absorption centers for the target molecules. This absorption can be switched on and off by the <b>reversible</b> <b>gel</b> phase transition. The multiple point absorption is the key, not only for reversibility, but also an essential ingredient for possible specificity of target recognition by polymers. Multivalent metal ions and multicharged pyranine are used as target molecules to demonstrate the principles, although the method will be applicable {{to a wide range of}} target molecules.

Here we describe the use of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to probe chain mobility in reversible hydrogels assembled from engineered proteins bearing terminal coiled-coil domains. We show that chain mobility {{can be related to}} the underlying dynamics of the coiled-coil domains by application of a 3 -state “hopping” model of chain migration. We further show that genetic programming allows the effective mobility of network chains to be varied 500 -fold through modest changes in protein sequence. Destabilization of the coiled-coil domains by site-directed mutagenesis increases the effective diffusivity of probe chains. Conversely, probe mobility is reduced by expanding the hydrophobic surface area of the coiled-coil domains through introduction of the bulky leucine surrogate homoisoleucine. Predictions from the 3 -state model imply asymmetric sequential binding of the terminal domains.

Lactose was selected has model substance for crystallization. Methods: Water solutions with different% of poloxamer 407, α-Lactose monohydrate, and ethanol were prepared and analysed by rheology to understand how the different components alter the gelling temperature. The systems with the required characteristics for lactose crystallization were prepared and the crystals recovered by cooling and then filtering the dispersion. Results: Rheological analysis showed interaction between the poloxamer and lactose. Increasing the quantity of poloxamer or lactose lowered the gelation temperature while the addition of small amounts of ethanol had a modest effect on the same property. These data were used to identify the ideal concentration of the components in order to prepare a system matching the features of our purpose. Such system yielded high quality crystals, with well-defined geometry and narrow particle size distribution.

The work presented in this thesis focuses {{on the study of}} aqueous dispersions of Laponite®, a synthetic clay mineral, and how the addition Pluronic F 127 ®, a triblock copolymer (PEO-PPO-PEO), changes the structure and properties of these dispersions. The first part of the work presented shows that solution interactions between F 127 molecules and Laponite particles {{have a significant effect on}} the room temperature properties of these systems and can interfere with gel forming abilities of Laponite. We also demonstrate a significant change in the microstructure of these materials using rheology and microscopy. In the second part, we focus on the thermal response of F 127 /Laponite dispersions. We show that these materials exhibit thermally <b>reversible</b> <b>gel</b> formation. At 3. 6 wt% F 127, the presence of Laponite is essential for thermal gel formation while at 10 wt% and 25 wt% F 127, the addition of Laponite delayed the onset of gel formation. The structure and thermally induced changes were probed using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). We show that F 127 adsorbed onto the surface of the particles collapse as temperature increases allowing particle aggregation and gel formation. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to produce a photogel forming system by adding a light active component to the formulation. Photorheology data indicates that gelation kinetics depend strongly on the formulation compositions using photo-rheology. Time-resolved UV-SAXS was used to track structural changes during UV irradiation and obtain direct evidence of particle restructuring. Finally, by comparing the structure changes with photo-rheology data, structure changes and bulk gel formation were found to occur on similar time scales.

40|$|Dissertação de mestrado em Tecnologias do Medicamento, apresentada à Faculdade de Farmácia da Universidade de CoimbraGels have {{consistently}} been studied for {{their role in}} topical and transdermal drug delivery systems as a non-invasive technique, for pharmaceutical and cosmetics application. These formulations are semi-solid three-dimensional structures, porous, with unique characteristics, such as rigidity and elasticity at the same time. Because of their high aqueous phase content, gels permit a greater dissolution of drugs through the skin and enhance skin hydration by retaining {{a significant amount of}} transepidermal water, in contrast to creams and ointments. Conventionally, gels are differentiated into two different types according to the nature of their liquid phase: hydrogels, which contain a polar solvent (water) and organogels, which contain an organic/non-polar solvent, as external phase. Hydrogels consist of polymeric materials that exhibit the ability to swell and retain a large amount of water or other biofluids in its structures. Despite its great affinity for water, they only possess a swelling behavior without dissolving in water. This proves its high flexibility, similar to natural tissue. Organogels consist of a network of self-assembled molecules which forms a thermally <b>reversible</b> <b>gel</b> upon cooling, immobilizing a non-aqueous liquid. They are mainly composed by lipids (organic phase), so they easily interact with the lipid skin surface and enhance the drug permeation through the skin. The most widely used lipids are based in edible oils due to their high biocompatibility, such as soybean oil, sunflower oil, sesame seed oil or olive oil. Organogels form viscoelastic structures through non-covalent associations with gelling agents in low concentrations. The commonly used organogelators include sorbitan monostearate or sorbitan monopalmitate. These superstructures, often long fibers or needle-shaped structures, which entangle or form pseudocrystalline regions, immobilizing the liquid largely by surface tension and forming a gel of variable consistency. Lecithin organogels are a special type of organogels that do not require addition of any additional surfactant or penetration enhancer, as lecithin serves both the purposes. Recent studies have reported other types of gels for dermal drug application, such as proniosomal gels, emulgels, bigels and aerogels, combining features of conventional hydrogels and organogels. In conclusion, further studies in gel technologies are essentials to overcome the drawbacks of each gel system and for developing cost effective delivery systems for transdermal applications...|$|E

An important area where aqueous physical gels are applied is the water-based coatings industry. Currently, classical associative thickeners are used to form transient networks based on hydrophobic interactions. Although this technology has greatly improved the properties of water-based coatings, there remain some problems related {{to the use of the}}se classical associative thickeners. In this Thesis we investigate aqueous physical gels based on interconnected polyelectrolyte complex micelles, as a new two-component associative thickener. The physical gels are prepared from an ABA triblock copolymer, with charged A-blocks and a neutral hydrophilic B-block, mixed with either an oppositely charged homopolymer or nanoparticle. Electrostatic interaction is the driving force for association of the oppositely charged components, leading to transient networks of interconnected flowerlike micelles or particles, depending on the origin of the oppositely charged component. The fact that we deal with a two-component system, as well as a completely different driving force for association, could potentially solve some of the current problems related to the use of the classical associative thickeners. Throughout this Thesis we have tried to link the microstructure of the gels to the macroscopic  properties. We do so by combining microscopic experimental techniques, such as (dynamic) light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering and (cryo-) scanning electron microscopy with macroscopic experimental techniques such as rheometry. In chapter 2 we show that we successfully prepared an aqueous multi-responsive <b>reversible</b> <b>gel</b> based on the bridging of polyelectrolyte complex micelles. At low concentrations these two oppositely charged polymers co-assemble spontaneously to form flowerlike polyelectrolyte complex micelles. If two micelles come close enough to each other, the micelles can become connected to each other, because a triblock copolymer can stick both end-blocks in two different micellar cores. This bridging is reversible, meaning that the micelles are continuously connected and disconnected. At high concentrations enough micelles become interconnected to form a percolating path through the sample, hence the solution becomes a physical gel. Due to the electrostatic driving force for the co-assembly of micelles, these gels are truly multi-responsive. The influence of the charge ratio on the formation of polyelectrolyte complex micelles and their networks is studied in detail in chapter 3. Our measurements suggest an asymmetry, with respect to the charge stoichiometric point, in the shape and size of the co-assembled complexes. In chapter 4 we take a closer look at the network topology and how this is influenced by total polymer concentration and salt concentration. In chapter 5 we show that it is possible to use charged inorganic nanoparticles as nodes in a transient network bridged by triblock copolymers with charged end-blocks. Since gels of this kind have never been described before, we named this class of gels 'Complex Composite Gels&# 39;...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We used a {{thermally}} <b>reversible</b> hybrid <b>gel</b> made {{of billions}} of physically jam-packed swollen thermally sensitive poly(N-isopropyl-acrylamide) chemical microgels. Laser light scattering study {{on a series of}} such hybrid gels formed at different gelling rates and temperatures revealed that the position-dependence of the scattering speckle pattern (static nonergodicity) came from large voids formed during the sol-gel transition. With a proper preparation, such a nonergodicity could be completely removed, indicating that the static nonergodicity generally observed in a gel is not intrinsic, but comes from the clustering “island ” structure formed during the gelation process...|$|R
40|$|Isostatic-pressing {{techniques}} using <b>reversible</b> <b>gels</b> as {{the pressing}} medium were studied {{for improving the}} uniformity in density and structure of UC [...] ZrC bodies. Control of powder-size fraction was studied {{as a means for}} controlling the pore distribution. Control of the carbon content by thermal treatment in a mixture of H/sub 2 / and hydrocarbon was also studied. Near stoichiometric 30 UC [...] 70 ZrC powder was prepared by gas-metal reaction. Assembly of an apparatus for study of the thermochemical vapor-deposition of tungsten is near completion. The vaporization and fission product release rates of a hot- pressed high-density 30 UC - 70 ZrC sample were measured from 1800 to 2000 deg C. A low-pressure gas adsorption apparatus was set up for measuring the true surface area of UC-ZrC samples. The cell used for the study of fission product diffusion through tungsten was fabricated. Samples are being prepared for fuel-clad compatibility and refractory-metal interdiffusion studies. Diffusion-emission studies were made on a rhenium-clad UC sample at 1800 deg C. The molybdenum pedestal of the loading device of a high-temperature mechanical testing furnace was modified. Thermionic emission microscopy showed that areas of high work function can co-exist with betteremitting UO/sub 2 / dispersions on the surface of a W-UO/sub 2 / cermet at 1650 deg C. Life-testing cells for fueled cesium converters using planar, as well as cylindrical fueled emitters were designed. The cylindrical configuration was favored, since a reliable cylindrical cell envelope was developed. (auth...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Microinjection of the {{catalytic}} subunit of cAMP-dependent {{protein kinase}} (A-kinase) into living fibroblasts or {{the treatment of}} these cells with agents that elevate the intracellular cAMP level caused marked alterations in cell morphology including a rounded phenotype and a complete loss of actin microfilament bundles. These effects were transient and fully <b>reversible.</b> Two-dimensional <b>gel</b> electrophoresis was {{used to analyze the}} changes in phosphoproteins from cells injected with A-kinase. These experiments showed that accompanying the disassembly of actin microfilaments, phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) increased and concomitantly, the phosphorylation of myosin P-light chain decreased. Moreover, inhibiting MLCK activity via microinjection of affinity-purifie...|$|R
