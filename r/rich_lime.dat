5000|$|The lime principally {{used for}} {{internal}} plastering is that calcined from chalk, oyster shells or other nearly pure limestone, {{and is known}} as fat, pure, chalk or <b>rich</b> <b>lime.</b> Hydraulic limes are also used by the plasterer, chiefly for external work. Perfect slaking of the calcined lime before being used is very important as, if used in a partially slaked condition, it will [...] "blow" [...] when in position and blister the work. Lime should therefore be run {{as soon as the}} building is begun, and at least three weeks should elapse between the operation of running the lime and its use. Due to time constraints Hydrated Lime mixed with plaster is normally used for modern construction. Slaking is not required if more time is allowed for finishing the surface after application which is a common practice where a quality finish is required, however in the housing industry it is often run for three days, {{the time it takes to}} prepare an average house for plastering, to achieve a lower quality cost effective finish.|$|E

50|$|Culture of {{this area}} has a vast {{influence}} of Haryana. Main speaking language is Rath, as {{of most of the}} Rath area. It seems very much closer to Haryanvi. Bantkhani is a village of 100% Hindu population, hence the culture involves all Hindu festivals and rituals. All villagers go to the temple of Maa Mansa Devi dhami twice a year. Today people are more advanced and they forget their culture but in village Bantkhani all people fellow their elders and do not forget their culture. An old temple of lord shiv is located centrally in the village. Recently on 28 April 2011 a temple of shyamji open by all villagers. It is situated in south-east section of the village. In Hinduism, Khatushyamji is a name and manifestation of Barbarika, son of Ghatotkacha. This manifestation is especially popular in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The original Sanskrit name Barbarīka is often replaced in Rajasthan by the Hindi version, Barbarīk, often written as Barbareek.Barbarika had obtained a boon from Krishna to the effect that he would be known by Krishna's own name (Shyam) in the Kaliyuga era (presently ongoing) and worshipped. Krishna had declared that Barbarika's devotees would be blessed just by pronouncing his name from the bottom of their hearts. Their wishes would be granted and troubles removed if they worship Shyamji (Barbarika) with a true piety.the temple is architecturally <b>rich</b> <b>lime</b> mortar,marbles & tiles have been used in constructing the structure.there is an open space in front of the entrance gate of the temple.hundreds of devotees visit the temple everyday.|$|E
5000|$|Saudi Arabia {{covers a}} large part of the Arabian Basin which is the primary {{producer}} of oil and gas.The basement structures beneath the Arabian Basin have controlled sediment deposition and structural growth of the basin. The main petroleum system of the Safaniya reservoir is the Mesozoic Petroleum System. The Mesozoic Petroleum System can be divided into two smaller petroleum systems, the Jurassic Petroleum System and Cretaceous Petroleum System. These small systems have generated hydrocarbons from the Jurassic to Cretaceous time period and largely contributed to the oil and gas production in the world's largest offshore field in Saudi Arabia the Safaniya Fields. The Jurassic Petroleum System consists of the Tuwaiq Mountain and Hanifa formations which are thick laminated organic <b>rich</b> <b>lime</b> mudstone units from the Jurassic period and contain a type II kerogen that has excellent source rock potential. The carbon isotope ratios between the oils (avg. δ 13C = - 26.6‰) and the kerogen (avg. δ 13C = - 26.4‰) and bitumen (avg. δ 13C = - 27.1‰) [...] The typical seal rock in the Mesozoic petroleum system that separates the Jurassic oils from mixing with the Cretaceous oils is a permeable evaporites anhydrite with a thickness reaching up to 287 m. The seal is not well developed along the eastern and northeastern part of Saudi Arabia. This allows Jurassic oils to mix with Cretaceous oils and causes the production of Cretaceous oils with a Jurassic oils to be limited to the eastern and northeastern part of Saudi Arabia. The Cretaceous Petroleum System consists of the main reservoir in the Safaniya fields, the Safaniya member. The Safaniya member is a thick sequence of sandstone, siltstone and shale with thin intervals of limestone, coal and varying amounts of ironstone. The Mauddud Formation is intra-formational shales and tight carbonates that seals the reservoirs within the Safaniya Formation.|$|E

Experiments inspired by the Nordtest project are then presented to assess moisture buffer effect in LHC material and retarded sorption effect is pointed out. Results from dry thermal conductivity measurements are also reported and influence of moisture content on this parameter is discussed. These results show why the use of LHC can help to reach high comfort feeling with low energy demand for indoor temperature and humidity regulations in sustainable buildings...|$|E

40|$|Field trials {{with four}} {{sainfoin}} cultivars {{as well as}} lucerne were carried out on two sites in southern Northrhine - Westphalia from 2003 to 2005. The objective of the experi-ments was to gain experience with the organic cultivation of sainfoin, an old fodder legume known for low yields but a high feeding value, particularly for horses. Crop development, dry matter yield and hay quality were determined. Crop dm yield on a loess soil site with a total lime content of 3207 mg kg- 1 was very low (about 1 t ha- 1) in 2005. Dry matter yield on a loess soil site <b>rich</b> in <b>lime</b> (total lime content = 13974 mg kg- 1) was comparatively high in 2004 (first cut: = 7. 5 t ha- 1), but decreased in 2005 (first cut: 1. 6 t ha- 1) mainly due to increasing weed infestation. Dry matter yield of sainfoin cv. Visnowsky was always lower compared with Lucerne, while digestable energy content tended to be higher in sainfoin. Sainfoin production may be an interest-ing option for organic horse fodder production, if soils are <b>rich</b> in <b>lime</b> and if weed pressure is manageable...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present work is to {{increase}} knowledge of in-plane tension behav-iour of masonry and develop a model able to describe the impact of parameters influencing cracking caused by restrained shrinkage. In the process the mechanism of load transfer between units and mortar joints is described. The influence of cohesion between units and mortar joints, unit and joint geometry and external loads on the mechanical properties of masonry and the response to in-plane loading is studied. It is concluded that, in order to obtain a realistic in-plane tension behaviour, tension and shear softening of the mortar joints must be included in the masonry model. A discontinuum model, implying discrete model-ling of units and mortar joints, is employed to reproduce masonry behaviour in crack zones. Where cracking is not expected, masonry is modelled as an elastic continuum. The model has been implemented in a commercial finite element programme. To obtain realistic data for the simulations, two types of clay bricks and three types of mor-tars were tested. Measurement of natural frequencies by a non-destructive method and direct tension tests up to failure were carried out. The moduli of elasticity determined by the two methods showed good agreement. Deformation controlled shear tests, at three different levels of normal pre-compression, were carried out on joints, with cement respectively <b>lime</b> <b>rich</b> mortars. The joints with the <b>lime</b> <b>rich</b> mortar exhibited more deformation in the pre-peak stage and a slower diminishing of the load bearing capacity in the post-peak stage compared to the cement rich mortar. Three-point bending tests were carried out on beams consisting of glulam at the ends and masonry in the central parts. Perforated bricks with a cement respectively <b>lime</b> <b>rich</b> mortar were used – testing with massive bricks was not possi-ble due to pre-mature failure caused by low bending strength in the joints. The mode I fracture energy of the mortar joints manufactured with the <b>lime</b> <b>rich</b> mortar was 50 % com-pared to the joints with cement rich mortars. Simulation of retrained shrinkage on massive, one-storey masonry walls with one-sided restraint show that application of slip joints between the wall and obstructing foundation has the strongest crack delaying effect. A shift from the strong cement rich mortar to the <b>lime</b> <b>rich</b> mortar allows the spacing of vertical movement joints to be increased by 10 %. Cracking in walls with openings occur at approximately 40 % lower imposed shrinkage levels than in massive walls. Cracking at windows located at the end of walls longer than 7 m can not be avoided be application of vertical movement joints...|$|R
