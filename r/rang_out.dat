5|$|A shot <b>rang</b> <b>out.</b> It {{was likely}} a warning shot fired by a panicked, {{exhausted}} British soldier from the 43rd, according to Captain Laurie's report to his commander after the fight. Two other regulars then fired immediately after that, shots splashing in the river, {{and then the}} narrow group up front, possibly thinking the order to fire had been given, fired a ragged volley before Laurie could stop them.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of January 30, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, a shot <b>rang</b> <b>out,</b> and Goebel fell wounded. He {{was taken to a}} nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds. Soldiers filled the streets and blocked {{entrance}} to the capitol. Defiantly, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall. By a strictly party-line vote, they adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices.|$|E
5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell <b>rang</b> <b>out.</b> One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E

50|$|The game {{uses the}} <b>ring</b> <b>out</b> system, {{which is a}} forcible {{maneuver}} that ejects the opponent from the arena and gains an automatic victory for the round. To achieve a <b>ring</b> <b>out,</b> a character must be knocked outside the ring by an enemy (the player cannot accidentally or deliberately get a <b>ring</b> <b>out</b> by hopping <b>out</b> of the <b>ring).</b> The only exception to this rule is Cervantes and SoulEdge, who can get a <b>ring</b> <b>out</b> by themselves upon performing a certain special attack, {{as long as they}} are near the edge of the arena.|$|R

5|$|Following some fruitless negotiations, {{the women}} and {{children}} were allowed to leave the house, and then both sides began firing. After about an hour, McFarlane called a ceasefire; according to some, a white flag had been waved in the house. As McFarlane stepped into the open, a shot <b>rang</b> <b>out</b> from the house, and he fell mortally wounded. The enraged rebels then set fire to the house, including the slave quarters, and Kirkpatrick surrendered. The number of casualties at Bower Hill is unclear; McFarlane and one or two other militiamen were killed; one U.S. soldier may have died from wounds received in the fight. The rebels sent the U.S. soldiers away. Kirkpatrick, Lenox, and Presley Neville were kept as prisoners, but they later escaped.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the General Assembly's contest committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital, awaiting the contest committee's findings. On the morning of January 30, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, a shot <b>rang</b> <b>out,</b> and Goebel fell wounded. He {{was taken to a}} nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds. As expected, the contest committee recommended invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor, and the General Assembly voted to certify the recommendation. Goebel was sworn in as governor, but he died on February 3. Beckham then took the oath of office and continued the legal challenge against Taylor and his lieutenant governor, John Marshall.|$|E
5|$|Shots <b>rang</b> <b>out</b> from Stephenson's men but the Sauk did not {{immediately}} return fire and the fight eventually descended into a bayonet and knife battle. The militia charged into the thicket and the Sauk returned fire, killing Stephen P. Howard. The militia force made two more charges into the woods. During one of these, Thomas Sublette stabbed a Sauk in the neck and George Eames was killed in action. The third charge resulted in severe wounds for Stephenson, who {{was shot in the}} chest with a musketball, and the death of militia man Michael Lovell. According to Stephenson's account of the battle, five or six Native American warriors were killed and the militia lost three men.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ringing</b> <b>out</b> is {{particularly}} important when mixing monitors, or foldback. As the performer or musician is usually behind the main PA system, the monitors are so they can hear themselves. As such, a microphone {{is much more likely}} to feedback through the monitor loudspeakers than the main PA. <b>Ringing</b> <b>out</b> can become quite complex when working with a large number of microphones and monitors. Indeed, with larger touring acts, one of the major advantages of the rise in use of in-ear monitors is the minimal <b>ringing</b> <b>out</b> that needs to be done.|$|R

5|$|Three days later, Admiral Coligny {{was walking}} back to his rooms from the Louvre when a shot <b>rang</b> <b>out</b> from a house and wounded him in the hand and arm. A smoking arquebus was {{discovered}} in a window, but the culprit had made his escape {{from the rear of}} the building on a waiting horse. Coligny was carried to his lodgings at the Hôtel de Béthisy, where the surgeon Ambroise Paré removed a bullet from his elbow and amputated a damaged finger with a pair of scissors. Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.• Frieda, 292. The Duke of Anjou was later reported as saying that he and Catherine had planned the assassination with Anne d'Este, who longed to avenge her husband, Francis, Duke of Guise.• For an overview of historians' various interpretations, see Holt, 83–4. Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.|$|E

Order was restored in a few moments.|$|E
50|$|Ahead <b>Rings</b> <b>Out</b> is {{the debut}} album by British blues-rock band Blodwyn Pig, {{released}} in 1969.

25|$|In 1993, {{a former}} Pentridge prisoner, Harold Sheehan, {{claimed he had}} {{witnessed}} the shooting but had not come forward at the time.

25|$|A {{large crowd}} {{gathered}} and cheers <b>rang</b> <b>out,</b> {{as did the}} fog-signals from the trains in the Woolloongabba railway yards (now part of the South East Busway). The Railway Band led the march of the Dungarees down Stanley Street on 30 November 1915. Enthusiastic crowds gathered in every doorway and veranda, and flags fluttered overhead.|$|E

25|$|At 4:45 PM EST, {{the moment}} the first fire alarm was sounded in 1911, {{hundreds}} of bells <b>rang</b> <b>out</b> in cities and towns across the nation. For this commemorative act, the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition organized hundreds of churches, schools, fire houses, and private individuals in the New York City region and across the nation. The Coalition maintains on its website a national map denoting each of the bells that rang that afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Maryland and Pennsylvania, alarmed and {{outraged by}} the invasion, rose at once to arms. Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin called for 50,000 militia to turn out, and he {{nominated}} Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds, a native Pennsylvanian, to command them. (This caused considerable frustration to McClellan and Reynolds's corps commander, Joseph Hooker, but general-in-chief Henry W. Halleck ordered Reynolds to serve under Curtin and told Hooker {{to find a new}} division commander.) As far north as Wilkes-Barre, church and courthouse bells <b>rang</b> <b>out,</b> calling men to drill.|$|E
25|$|The Dungarees set {{out from}} Glengallan in the early {{afternoon}} of 16 November 1915 for the 16 kilometre march to Allora. They stopped at Mount Marshall for afternoon tea, before heading into Allora for the night. The shops were decorated with bunting, the school bell <b>rang</b> <b>out,</b> and the town band accompanied them into town. They stopped to pay their respects at the Boer War Memorial where the Allora Mayor, Cr T Muir, made a speech. The memorial had been unveiled in 1904 by Colonel (later Sir) Harry Chauvel, honouring the four local men who died, and 35 others who served in the southern African conflict. The men were supplied with a hot dinner at Weatherley's Café.|$|E
