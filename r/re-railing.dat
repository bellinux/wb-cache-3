25|$|On 7 July 2015, trailer 58 {{suffered}} a serious derailment {{on a relatively}} new crossover just north of Laxey Station, toppling onto its side. Services were suspended between Laxey and Ramsey. A complex operation was undertaken to lift the trailer back upright. It required a road closure, removal of overhead line equipment and a large crane. The <b>re-railed</b> trailer was then moved by tractor to Laxey Station and has since returned to service after overhaul.|$|R
50|$|At about 2016 on Friday 6 May 2011, {{freight train}} 4PM6 derailed the {{trailing}} bogie of the 49th wagon (RQHY 07069C) at Port Augusta near the Carlton Parade level crossing (91.559 km). About 1300 m later, the wagon <b>re-railed</b> itself as it entered the road pavement near the Stirling Road level crossing. There were no injuries {{as a result}} of the derailment but there was minor damage to rolling stock and track.|$|R
50|$|The Depot also stabled a Breakdown Train {{comprising}} {{three vehicles}} carrying {{all the equipment}} necessary for <b>re-railing</b> duties; a 76-tonne diesel crane; a riding van for staff, with cooking, washing and toilet facilities.|$|E
50|$|Most {{heritage}} railways in the UK {{have one}} or more preserved railway cranes, either just as historic exhibits, or as fully functioning examples assisting with {{the operation of the}} railway. Although not normally required for <b>re-railing</b> activities, they are exceptionally useful for track relaying and the restoration of locomotives and rolling stock, and help to avoid expenditure on outside contractors.|$|E

500|$|With {{the inauguration}} of Dwight D. Eisenhower set to occur on January20, the {{passenger}} cars were <b>re-railed</b> and 4876 was lowered {{the rest of the}} way into the baggage room. A temporary floor was erected over the locomotive so as to not impede the crowds traveling to Washington, D.C. for the inauguration. After the inauguration, 4876 was cut into [...] sections, hoisted from the baggage room, and reassembled in the Altoona shops. [...] The insurance company deemed it less expensive to reassemble 4876 than to replace it with a new locomotive.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the {{locomotive}} {{was purchased by}} the Federation of Rail Organisations of New Zealand who concluded {{an agreement with the}} Diesel Traction Group to have {{the locomotive}} moved to their premises for restoration. The first stage of this relocation took place in August 2008 when 1501 was <b>re-railed,</b> and then was towed to Westfield Depot for assessment. In January 2009, members of the Group accompanied the locomotive on a three-day 1,100km trip to Christchurch, from where it moved to their Ferrymead Railway base a few days later.|$|R
5000|$|The {{investors were}} {{taken on a}} special train to Dete, with stops at Sawmills to see areas which they may be {{interested}} in investing in, including a <b>re-railing</b> (laying of new rail) project on a section of the north corridor rail and the Centralised Train Control System at Sawmills. They also assessed assets at Dabuka Marshalling Yards near Gweru where they inspected the track condition and the electrified section.|$|E

50|$|In 2014, it was {{announced}} that a volunteer-run working military railway would be created {{on the site of the}} former Ministry of Defence depot. The Long Marston Military Railway project sought to keep alive military railway skills, such as <b>re-railing</b> of trains, as well as locomotive driving and track laying, following the disbanding of the British Army's last railway unit, the Royal Logistic Corps 275 Railway Squadron, in March 2014 as a result of Government defence cuts. The 79 Railway Squadron had been disbanded in 2012.|$|E
50|$|On 14 December 2014 the 12381 UP Howrah - New Delhi Poorva Express derailed at 8.27 am IST {{after leaving}} Howrah at 8.15 am IST. 11 sleeper coaches and a pantry car (AC Hot Buffer Car) of the New Delhi-bound Poorva Express derailed at Liluah shortly after leaving Howrah station. There was no {{casualty}} or injury to any passenger. Like Kalka Mail this train was also hauled by Howrah-based WAP-7 30321. But the locomotive did not face much damage hence after undergoing fault diagnostics and repairs the locomotive has been <b>re-railed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{breakdown}} van, {{engine and}} tender were all driven forward 3.5 metres. The engine collided with an [...] "H" [...] wagon {{that was being}} <b>re-railed</b> which, in turn, was driven forward into another five goods wagons. Members of the rescue gang, {{who had been working}} on the [...] "H" [...] wagon, were crushed beneath the wreckage. An additional breakdown train was sent to the crash site from Toowoomba at 10am. Fifty workers dug frantically in the wreckage to free trapped workers, however six had died due to horrific injuries received in the collision.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the maintenance of}} all locomotives, some Bahnbetriebswerke are also responsible for looking after special duty trains. The most important units are breakdown trains (for <b>re-railing</b> derailed rolling stock) and rotary snow ploughs. There are also fire fighting trains to enable fires in the area to be put out as quickly as possible. And for the smooth running of a Bahnbetriebswerk tractors and shunters are needed in order to move wagons and locomotives that are unable to move under their own power. Finally almost every Bahnbetriebswerk has a variety of special vehicles.|$|E
50|$|By October 1971, {{after more}} than four decades of service, all Greyville's Class GCAs had been {{withdrawn}} since they were no longer needed after completion of the South Coast lineâ€™s electrification. By 1973, the thirty-nine original members of the Class had dwindled to seven, all stationed at Mason's Mill in Pietermaritzburg, from where they still worked the light rail Underberg branch, often double-heading. By April of that year, however, the number had dropped to five. They were all withdrawn from service in October 1975. One of their last tasks was to work the track <b>re-railing</b> train which laid the heavier rails which enabled diesel-electric locomotives to finally replace them.|$|E

50|$|An {{accident}} {{occurred at}} this station in 1974 when an excursion train from Hereford to Weymouth, on its return journey, {{did not stop}} at the signal controlling the entry to the single line section, {{and ran into the}} sand drag. The locomotive (a Class 47) ran right through the sand drag and out the other side, followed by a couple of coaches. Eighteen passengers suffered minor injuries in the derailment, but no one was seriously hurt. The passengers were taken home by train via Southampton later that evening, and the loco was subsequently <b>re-railed</b> and recovered during the night several weeks later.|$|R
50|$|As {{well as the}} {{maintenance}} of locomotives, several Bahnbetriebswerke are also responsible for looking after special trains - even the changeover of traction has not changed that. The most important units are emergency trains (to <b>re-rail</b> rolling stock that has derailed) and snow clearance equipment. Up to the 1980s there were also fire trains, whose function has since been subsumed by the railway fire services. For the smooth operation of a Bahnbetriebswerk shunters are also needed to move wagons, coaches and locomotives that cannot move under their own power. Up to 20 years ago there were other special trains, such as the used oil trains, that have since all been retired.|$|R
50|$|On 10 July 2011 Kalka Mail derailed on the Kanpur-Fatehpur line {{near the}} Fatehpur railway station, more than 72 persons died and 200 were injured, some critically. The train was hauled by Ghaziabad-based WAP-7 30221. Malfunction of the undergear of the {{locomotive}} {{could also be}} a reason. The driver of the Kalka Mail said he saw the engine shaking. A post-accident diagnostic revealed that the first axle (leading) of the locomotive registered a jerk and the fourth axle (trailing bogie) showed loss of contact of the wheel with the track. The locomotive in question has been <b>re-railed</b> and is undergoing fault diagnostics and repairs.|$|R
5000|$|Currently, {{the line}} is single-track, unelectrified, sees very little use and has no {{scheduled}} passenger service.Irregular freight train service was stopped on October 2013; Ilyeong Station was downgraded to unattended station on January 24, 2014.After that,the line became inoperational and used for model photoshooting etc. more or less legally until test run of freight trains resumed {{at the end of}} 2015 until end of January 2016. Following to the <b>re-railing</b> works at the northern part of Seoul Station, a need to re-route the freight trainsthrough Gyooe lines occurred, and as the Yongsan Line became underground thus unusable for peacetime freight train service(incline of 34.5 permils)and Hyochang Line was abolished, the trains have to be rerouted through the Gyooe Line and thus test operation resumed on April 20,2016 with its railroad crossings operational and staffed again. Regular freight train operation resumes on May 16,2016 [...]|$|E
5000|$|The route was a 2Â½ mile [...] "L" [...] shaped circle {{track with}} the town of Tombstone Junction on one end that {{traveled}} through the wooded hills of the Falls area and came back again. The line featured steep overlooks, sharp turns, and rough track. It was actually a very close representation of what riding a hastily laid start of the 20th century rail line would have been. The 180-degree turn the line made {{in front of the}} train station was so tight that running the locomotive through it proved problematic sometimes. When the locomotive was being operated by engineer Bill Johnson and fireman Don Vanover, it derailed next to the amphitheater stage just {{prior to the start of}} a Loretta Lynn performance. This was at the top of the 8% grade that the train had to pull which made <b>re-railing</b> the locomotive difficult.|$|E
30|$|Aluminothermic welding of rails {{is widely}} used within the railway {{industry}} for in-track welding during <b>re-railing</b> operations and defect removal [3]. The process suffers from variable quality in finished welds due to inherent limitations in the field. Under high axle load conditions, the recent failures in aluminothermic welds represent {{one of the main}} risks for a catastrophic derailment and a major limitation to further increases in axle loads. Improved rail welding and track maintenance practices would be required to meet the performance demands of higher axle loads.|$|E
50|$|John Wallace Pringle, Chief Inspecting Officer of Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate {{conducted}} the inquiry in person.Following the accident, the Southern Railway withdrew all the remaining 'River' class tank engines, which caused a public sensation at the time. Other drivers testified about {{the instability of}} the class and it emerged that one locomotive had previously derailed at speed, though it had miraculously <b>re-railed</b> itself. The engines' high centre of gravity, their hard springing, and the tendency for {{the water in the}} side tanks to surge, all caused the engines to roll dangerously at speed, so much so that in this accident the nearside wheels had lifted.|$|R
50|$|From Eveleigh {{the gun was}} hauled to Station East Box by a {{superheated}} T-class locomotive {{and from}} there pushed forward to a specially prepared track at Eddy Avenue, via a ramp, the rails of which sank under the weight (approximately 18Â½ tons per axle). After strengthening, another attempt was more successful, although one bogie ran off the end and remained suspended in mid-air until powerful jacks were used to <b>re-rail</b> the trophy, which was floodlit at night by special arrangement with the Australian General Electric Co. for some weeks during the 1920 visit of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) who inspected it. Thousands of Sydneysiders passing the site saw the gun until its eventual movement to Canberra in 1923.|$|R

40|$|The {{non-uniform}} hardness distribution, metallurgy and ratchetting behaviour of head-hardened Australian {{rail steel}} (AS 60 HH) are studied. In {{a bid to}} extrapolate material properties across the rail head continuum, a unified material model of the rail head has been developed, in which only the hardness of the material is variable. This simplification is shown to enable the material model to reasonably describe ratchetting behaviour across the rail head for heat-treated pearlitic steels. Finally, homogeneous material ratchetting models are used to study the evolution of plastic strain deformation under realistic rail-wheel contact conditions. The results show that non-uniform material properties may compromise ratcheting response with wear progression, thus impacting lifetime of AS 60 HH rail steel and <b>re-railing</b> frequency...|$|E

5000|$|The {{movement}} of locomotives to the holding sidings for inspection {{was also an}} issue, due to the deteriorating condition of the track in Woodham's yard. With the need to occasionally move locomotives in order to retrieve another which had been purchased for preservation, derailments would sometimes occur due to the poor state of the track. As Woodham's lacked the necessary equipment to <b>re-rail</b> the locomotives, {{it was easier to}} simply cut part of the derailed wheelset away, allowing the {{movement of}} the affected locomotive to continue. During this period, Woodham's also began scrapping locomotive tenders with the intention of then re-selling the rolling tender frames to other users. The majority of these frames were purchased by the Duport Steelworks at Briton Ferry for conversion to ingot carriers.|$|R
50|$|In 1854 the portage {{railroad}} was rendered obsolete by {{the advance}} of railway technology--more powerful locomotives allowed construction by the Pennsylvania Railroad of a railroad over the Alleghenies. Construction on the New Portage Railroad, a $2.14 million realignment to bypass the inclines, continued despite this, opening in 1856. On July 31, 1857, the Pennsylvania Railroad bought the portage railroad from the state, abandoning most and using the rest as local branches. Nearly half a century later, the graded roadbeds of the descending section east of the Gallitzin Tunnel was <b>re-railed</b> with standard gauge freight tracks and reopened as a freight bypass line in 1904. Pennsylvania Railroad successor Conrail abandoned this line to Hollidaysburg {{and most of the}} branch trackage along the Juniata River in 1981 and removed the rails.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the railways, {{locomotives}} and rolling stock were small enough to be <b>re-railed</b> manually using jacks and tackle, but as they became bigger and heavier this method became inadequate.Enter into this the steam crane and cable winch. Appearing about 1890, the cranes increased in size, commensurate with the rise of steel Pullman cars, so by 1910 steam cranes reached their peak of development. Many of these 1910-era cranes were so useful and powerful, that they remained in service until the 1980s. The combination of a quick-firing steam boiler, heavy steam winch, and cable hook could little be improved upon, and thus remained in service. Also, steam engines did not mind being parked for months, with a little care, and were ready to go to work when needed.|$|R
