5|$|Petya {{was first}} {{discovered}} in March 2016; unlike {{other forms of}} encrypting <b>ransomware,</b> the malware aimed to infect the master boot record, installing a payload which encrypts the file tables of the NTFS file system the next time that the infected system boots, blocking the system from booting into Windows at all until the ransom is paid. Check Point reported that despite what it believed to be an innovative evolution in <b>ransomware</b> design, it had resulted in relatively-fewer infections than other <b>ransomware</b> active {{around the same time}} frame.|$|E
5|$|A {{minor in}} Japan {{was arrested for}} {{creating}} and distributing <b>ransomware</b> code.|$|E
5|$|Symantec has {{classified}} <b>ransomware</b> to be {{the most}} dangerous cyber threat.|$|E
5|$|Fusob {{has lots}} {{in common with}} Small, which is another major family of mobile <b>ransomware.</b> They {{represented}} over 93% of mobile ransomwares between 2015 and 2016.|$|E
5|$|Fusob {{is one of}} {{the major}} mobile <b>ransomware</b> families. Between April 2015 and March 2016, about 56 percent of {{accounted}} mobile ransomwares was Fusob.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ransomware</b> {{is a type}} of {{malicious}} software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple <b>ransomware</b> may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and Bitcoin are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Recent <b>Ransomware</b> attack in 2017 has caused a stir in the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{from around}} 2012 {{the use of}} <b>ransomware</b> scams has grown internationally. in June 2013, vendor McAfee {{released}} data showing that it had collected {{more than double the}} number of samples of <b>ransomware</b> that quarter than it had in the same quarter of the previous year. CryptoLocker was particularly successful, procuring an estimated US $3 million before it was taken down by authorities, and CryptoWall was estimated by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to have accrued over US $18m by June 2015.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of tools {{intended}} specifically to decrypt files locked by <b>ransomware,</b> although successful recovery may not be possible. If the same encryption key is used for all files, decryption tools use files for which there are both uncorrupted backups and encrypted copies (a known-plaintext attack in the jargon of cryptanalysis); recovery of the key, if it is possible, may take several days. Free <b>ransomware</b> decryption tools can help decrypt files encrypted by the following forms of ransomware: AES_NI, Alcatraz Locker, Apocalypse, BadBlock, Bart, BTCWare, Crypt888, CryptoMix, CrySiS, EncrypTile, FindZip, Globe, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LambdaLocker, Legion, NoobCrypt, Stampado, SZFLocker, TeslaCrypt, XData.|$|E
5|$|Different tactics {{have been}} used on iOS devices, such as {{exploiting}} iCloud accounts and using the Find My iPhone system to lock access to the device. On iOS 10.3, Apple patched a bug in the handling of JavaScript pop-up windows in Safari that had been exploited by <b>ransomware</b> websites.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, the WannaCry <b>ransomware</b> attack {{spread through}} the Internet, using an exploit vector named EternalBlue, which was leaked from the U.S. National Security Agency. The <b>ransomware</b> attack, {{unprecedented}} in scale, infected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries, using 20 different languages to demand money from users using Bitcoin cryptocurrency. WannaCrypt demanded US$300 per computer. The attack affected Telefónica and several other large companies in Spain, as well as parts of the British National Health Service (NHS), where at least 16 hospitals had to turn away patients or cancel scheduled operations, FedEx, Deutsche Bahn, Honda, Renault, {{as well as the}} Russian Interior Ministry and Russian telecom MegaFon. The attackers gave their victims a 7-day deadline from the day their computers got infected, after which the encrypted files would be deleted.|$|E
5|$|Payment is {{virtually}} always the goal, {{and the victim}} is coerced into paying for the <b>ransomware</b> to be removed—which {{may or may not}} actually occur—either by supplying a program that can decrypt the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. A key element in making <b>ransomware</b> work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>ransomware</b> strains {{have used}} proxies tied to Tor hidden {{services}} {{to connect to}} their command and control servers, increasing the difficulty of tracing {{the exact location of}} the criminals. Furthermore, dark web vendors have increasingly started to offer the technology as a service.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting <b>ransomware</b> {{returned}} to prominence in late 2013 with {{the propagation of}} CryptoLocker—using the Bitcoin digital currency platform to collect ransom money. In December 2013, ZDNet estimated based on Bitcoin transaction information that between 15 October and 18 December, the operators of CryptoLocker had procured about US$27 million from infected users. The CryptoLocker technique was widely copied in the months following, including CryptoLocker 2.0 (though not {{to be related to}} CryptoLocker), CryptoDefense (which initially contained a major design flaw that stored the private key on the infected system in a user-retrievable location, due to its use of Windows' built-in encryption APIs), and the August 2014 discovery of a Trojan specifically targeting network-attached storage devices produced by Synology. In January 2015, it was reported that ransomware-styled attacks have occurred against individual websites via hacking, and through <b>ransomware</b> designed to target Linux-based web servers.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Fortinet {{created a}} {{standalone}} subsidiary, Fortinet Federal, focused on cybersecurity products for government agencies. Former National Security Agency director Mike McConnell is on Fortinet Federal’s board, and 12 of the 15 U.S. Cabinet departments use Fortinet products. That same year, Fortinet researchers discovered a spyware that scams victims by impersonating the IRS and MacRansom, a <b>ransomware</b> program specifically targeting Mac computers.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, a 21-year-old {{man from}} Virginia, whose {{computer}} coincidentally did contain pornographic photographs of underaged girls {{with whom he}} had conducted sexualized communications, turned himself in to police after receiving and being deceived by <b>ransomware</b> purporting to be an FBI message accusing him of possessing child pornography. An investigation discovered the incriminating files, and the man was charged with child sexual abuse and possession of child pornography.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a typical}} mobile <b>ransomware,</b> it employs scare tactics to extort {{people to pay}} a ransom. The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, {{demanding}} the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.|$|E
5|$|Security experts {{found that}} the <b>ransomware</b> {{did not use the}} EternalBlue exploit to spread, and a simple method to {{vaccinate}} an unaffected machine running older Windows versions was found by October 24, 2017. Further, the sites that had been used to spread the bogus Flash updating have gone offline or removed the problematic files within a few days of its discovery, effectively killing off the spread of Bad Rabbit.|$|E
5|$|Server Message Block version 1 (SMB1) is {{disabled}} by default on version 1709. The Home and the Pro editions only disable the SMB1 server, but retain the SMB1 client, so they can connect to SMB1 network shares. The Enterprise and the Education editions disable the SMB1 entirely. This version of the 30-years-old protocol gained notoriety in the WannaCry <b>ransomware</b> attack, although Microsoft has been discouraging its use even before.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} file {{encrypting}} <b>ransomware</b> was invented and implemented by Young and Yung at Columbia University and {{was presented at}} the 1996 IEEE Security & Privacy conference. It is called cryptoviral extortion and it was inspired by the fictional facehugger in the movie Alien. Cryptoviral extortion is the following three-round protocol carried out between the attacker and the victim.|$|E
5|$|The idea of abusing {{anonymous}} cash {{systems to}} safely collect ransom from human kidnapping {{was introduced in}} 1992 by Sebastiaan von Solms and David Naccache. This money collection method is a key feature of <b>ransomware.</b> In the von Solms-Naccache scenario a newspaper publication was used (since bitcoin ledgers did not exist {{at the time the}} paper was written).|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a <b>ransomware</b> payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E
5|$|Examples of extortionate <b>ransomware</b> became {{prominent}} in May 2005. By mid-2006, Trojans such as Gpcode, TROJ.RANSOM.A, Archiveus, Krotten, Cryzip, and MayArchive began utilizing more sophisticated RSA encryption schemes, with ever-increasing key-sizes. Gpcode.AG, which was detected in June 2006, was encrypted with a 660-bit RSA public key. In June 2008, a variant known as Gpcode.AK was detected. Using a 1024-bit RSA key, {{it was believed}} {{large enough to be}} computationally infeasible to break without a concerted distributed effort.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, Russian {{authorities}} arrested nine individuals {{connected to}} a <b>ransomware</b> Trojan known as WinLock. Unlike the previous Gpcode Trojan, WinLock did not use encryption. Instead, WinLock trivially restricted access to the system by displaying pornographic images, and asked users to send a premium-rate SMS (costing around US$10) to receive a code {{that could be used}} to unlock their machines. The scam hit numerous users across Russia and neighboring countries—reportedly earning the group over US$16 million.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting <b>ransomware</b> reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which {{generated}} a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Microsoft Malware Protection Center {{identified}} a trend away from WSF files {{in favor of}} LNK files and PowerShell scripting. These LNK shortcut files install Locky <b>ransomware</b> by automating infection operations {{rather than relying on}} traditional user downloads of WSF files—all of which is made possible by the universal PowerShell Windows application. Unfortunately, cyber criminals have been able to leverage PowerShell for their attacks for years. In a recent report, the application was found to be involved in nearly 40% of endpoint security incidents. While attackers have been finding weaknesses in the Windows operating system for years, it’s clear that there’s something problematic with PowerShell scripting.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} <b>ransomware</b> Trojans {{surfaced}} {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes {{from being able to}} scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio.|$|E
25|$|This {{has led to}} {{increased}} fear and knowledge about <b>ransomware</b> in general and has brought <b>ransomware</b> into public spotlight once again.|$|E
25|$|There {{appears to}} be a trend in <b>ransomware</b> being used to attack {{hospitals}} and it {{appears to be}} growing.|$|E
25|$|By December 2013, Cryptolocker <b>ransomware</b> {{infected}} 250,000 {{personal computers}} by first targeting businesses using a Zip archive attachment that {{claimed to be}} a customer complaint, and later targeting general public using a link in an email regarding a problem clearing a check. The <b>ransomware</b> scrambles and locks files on the computer and requests the owner make a payment in exchange for the key to unlock and decrypt the files. According to Dell SecureWorks, 0.4% or more of those infected likely agreed to the ransom demand.|$|E
25|$|The general {{consensus}} among security experts {{to protect yourself}} from <b>ransomware,</b> including Locky, is to keep your installed programs updated and to only open attachments from known senders.|$|E
25|$|This {{has been}} a {{different}} route than most <b>ransomware</b> since it uses macros and attachments to spread rather than being installed by a Trojan or using a previous exploit.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} distribution {{methods for}} Locky {{have been used}} since the <b>ransomware</b> was released. These distribution methods include exploit kits, Word and Excel attachments with malicious macros, DOCM attachments, and zipped JS Attachments.|$|E
25|$|Malicious {{software}} {{used and}} {{spread on the}} Internet includes computer viruses which copy {{with the help of}} humans, computer worms which copy themselves automatically, software for denial of service attacks, <b>ransomware,</b> botnets, and spyware that reports on the activity and typing of users. Usually, these activities constitute cybercrime. Defense theorists have also speculated about the possibilities of cyber warfare using similar methods on a large scale.|$|E
25|$|Several {{companies}} offer {{banks and other}} organizations {{likely to suffer from}} phishing scams round-the-clock services to monitor, analyze and assist in shutting down phishing websites. Individuals can contribute by reporting phishing to both volunteer and industry groups, such as cyscon or PhishTank. Individuals can also contribute by reporting phone phishing attempts to Phone Phishing, Federal Trade Commission. Phishing web pages and emails can be reported to Google. The Internet Crime Complaint Center noticeboard carries phishing and <b>ransomware</b> alerts.|$|E
25|$|Investigative Mission – Safeguarding {{the payment}} and {{financial}} {{systems of the}} United States {{from a wide range}} of financial and computer-based crimes, including but not limited to counterfeit U.S. currency, identity theft, access device fraud, cyber crimes, network intrusions, <b>ransomware,</b> business email compromise, bank fraud, and illicit financing operations. The Secret Service is a key member of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), which investigates and combats terrorism on a national and international scale. The Service also investigates missing and exploited children, and is a core partner of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC).|$|E
25|$|For {{businesses}} {{the company}} markets the Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business suite. It includes a centralized user interface and management application called the Kaspersky Security Center. The cybersecurity software itself {{is called the}} Kaspersky Security Network. The Kaspersky Administration KitSecurity Center manages configuration, installation and remote use. The business suite also has quarantine, reporting, and other features. Its software product for businesses with 25 staff or less is called Kaspersky Small Office Security (KSOS). Within the suite are products specifically for virtualization security, mobile security, and fraud protection among others. Kaspersky also develops a free tool that helps businesses gain access to Windows devices that are infected by <b>ransomware.</b>|$|E
