5|$|Liverpool {{began to}} exert more pressure, {{although}} all their play {{was in front}} of the Milan penalty area, while Milan were unable to keep possession of the ball. In an attempt to bring about an equalising goal, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez substituted Mascherano for striker Peter Crouch. Milan had an attack minutes later, but Inzaghi was unable to control the ball. Inzaghi made amends minutes later when he scored Milan's second goal. With Mascherano substituted, Kaká had the space to pick out a pass to Inzaghi, who took the ball {{to the side of the}} Liverpool goalkeeper Reina and <b>rolled</b> <b>it</b> into the net to make the score 2–0 to Milan. Liverpool managed to pull one goal back in the 88th minute when Kuyt scored after Agger had flicked on Pennant's corner. However, they were unable to find a second goal and the referee blew for full-time with the score 2–1 to Milan.|$|E

500|$|Pearson {{was born}} near Spartanburg, South Carolina. When Pearson was young, he climbed a tree {{at the local}} stock car racing track (Spartanburg Fairgrounds) to see the races. Pearson said, [...] "I'd always been {{interested}} in cars, and I decided right then that was what I wanted to do with my life." [...] He worked with his brother in a car body repair shop, and used the money to purchase a Ford coach. Pearson removed the fenders to convert the vehicle into a street rod. He jumped the car over ditches until he <b>rolled</b> <b>it</b> over. His mother paid him to junk the car and he used the money to purchase another car to build. In 1952, he raced a 1940 Ford at dirt tracks and won $30 in an outlaw class race. He kept winning and attracted the attention of Spartanburg's racing community, including Joe Littlejohn.|$|E

500|$|Blake Snow of GamePro {{listed the}} Nomad as fifth {{on his list}} of the [...] "10 Worst-Selling Handhelds of All Time," [...] criticizing its poor timing into the market, {{inadequate}} advertising, and poor battery life. [...] Scott Alan Marriott of Allgame placed more than simply timing into reasons for the Nomad's lack of sales, stating, [...] "The reason for the Nomad's failure may have very well been a combination of poor timing, company mistrust and the relatively high cost of the machine (without a pack-in). Genesis owners were too skittish to invest in another 16-bit system." [...] The staff of Retro Gamer, however, praised the Nomad, saying in a retrospective that Nomad was [...] "the first true 16-bit handheld" [...] and declared it the best variant of the Genesis. [...] In the same article, Retro Gamer notes the collectability of the Nomad, due to its low production, and states, [...] "Had Sega cottoned on {{to the concept of}} the Nomad before the Mega Drive 2, and <b>rolled</b> <b>it</b> out as a true successor to the Mega Drive ... then perhaps Sega may have succeeded in its original goal to prolong the life of the Mega Drive in the U.S." ...|$|E

The weather was atrocious and at times pitched the flight deck [...] and <b>rolled</b> <b>it</b> [...] spray sweeping over the deck.

[...] A [...] was run out on the right hand side onto the dock, and passengers disembarked. [...] Eventually the lean became so sharp that the gangway could not reach the dock, and it had to be supplemented by a long plank. [...] The ship started flooding and began to sink. [...] According to a report, all the officers remained calm. [...] Captain Cockle personally rescued three loggers who were trapped on board.

2500|$|Klusener scored {{consecutive}} fours in {{the first}} two balls of the over (bowled by Damien Fleming), levelling the scores and leaving South Africa with only 1 run to win in 4 balls with Klusener on strike. The third ball was a dot, and the fourth saw Klusener mis-hit his shot to mid-wicket fielder Mark Waugh. Klusener went for the run, although chances of a run-out were high and two balls were still remaining. However, Donald at the other end, keeping his eyes on the ball, did not see Klusener sprinting down the pitch and did not hear the call to run, and Klusener was almost at the bowler's end by the time Donald (who had also dropped his bat) began running. By then, Waugh had thrown the ball to Fleming, who <b>rolled</b> <b>it</b> to Adam Gilchrist who took the bails off at the other end, meaning Donald was run-out by some distance, thus ending the match with the scores level. However, a tie meant that Australia progressed to the final since they had beaten South Africa in the group stages of the tournament. As commentator Bill Lawry put it during the final ball: ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2005 and 2006 iPlayer trials, {{the digital}} rights {{management}} (DRM) system used was based on Microsoft's Windows Media DRM, which led to concerns about cross-platform availability, as this technology is available only for Windows XP. However, some users have managed to get it working using compatibility options in Microsoft's Windows Vista. The BBC emphasises that it [...] "has a commitment to platform neutrality and a remit to make its content as widely available as possible", and that while the initial trial used a Microsoft-based technology, they are constantly looking for new technologies which {{would enable them to}} relax the restriction: Ashley Highfield, then BBC's director of Future Media and Technology, explained that [...] "we have always started with the platform that reaches the most number of people and then <b>rolled</b> <b>it</b> out from there". They also point out that not all of the content delivered through the iPlayer will be subject to DRM – live streaming content, for instance, may not need the same level of control, presumably implying that players for OS X and Linux systems could be developed with a restricted range of content. However, a project was started to enable the iPlayer to work with other platforms via the Wine project. Streaming via the BBC iPlayer website is now available in all browsers supporting Adobe Flash.
