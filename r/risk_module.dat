40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{systematically}} analyze the equity <b>risk</b> <b>module</b> of Solvency II, the new regulatory framework in the European Union. The particularly interesting aspect of this module is that it contains a symmetric adjustment mechanism commonly known as equity dampener which shall reduce procyclicality and thus systemic risk in the insurance industry. We critically review the equity <b>risk</b> <b>module</b> in three steps: we first analyze the sensitivities of the equity <b>risk</b> <b>module</b> with respect to the underlying technical basis, then work out potential basis risk (i. e., deviations of the insurers actual equity risk from the Solvency II equity risk), and—based on these results—measure the impact of the symmetric adjustment mechanism on the goals of Solvency II. The equity <b>risk</b> <b>module</b> is backward looking in nature and a substantial basis risk exists if realistic equity portfolios are considered. Also, the adjusted capital stress substantially deviates from the proposed 99. 5 % confidence level. Our results are helpful for academics interested in regulation and risk management as well as for practitioners and regulators working on the implementation of such models...|$|E

40|$|Software {{projects}} have inherent uncertainties and risks. Social software projects suffer even more requirement changes and require {{more attention to}} risk management. Risk analysis and planning are complex, {{making it difficult to}} manage risks effectively through subjective judgment. At present, ample empirical research on intelligent decision-support models for risk analysis in software projects exists. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, empirical models for software project risk planning, or those related to integrative software risk analysis and planning are not available. Thus, the current study proposes an integrative framework for intelligent software project risk planning (IF-ISPRP) to help in minimizing the impacts of project risks and achieving a better foreseeable project outcome. IF-ISPRP includes two core components, namely, <b>risk</b> analysis <b>module</b> and <b>risk</b> planning <b>module.</b> The <b>risk</b> analysis <b>module</b> is to predict whether a project will be successful or not. The <b>risk</b> planning <b>module</b> is to produce a cost-minimal action set for risk control based on the <b>risk</b> analysis <b>module.</b> For integrative <b>risk</b> analysis and planning, we propose a novel many-to-many actionable knowledge discovery (MMAKD) method for complex risk planning. We also apply the framework on a social media platform project, Guangzhou Wireless City, and demonstrate how the model can generate a cost-minimal action set to mitigate the project risk. The risk-control actions found may help develop strategies on mitigating the risks of other social software projects. We hope that the proposed framework will provide an intelligent decision-support tool for project stakeholders to effectively control project risks by integrating risk analysis and planning.

For example, in the Solvency II paradigm, the market <b>risk</b> <b>module</b> comprises six submodules dealing with interest rate, equity, property, spread, currency risk, and the risk arising from market concentrations. The capital requirement for each submodule is determined based on prespecified scenarios, calibrated such that the resulting SCR should correspond to the VaR at the 99.5 % confidence level over a one-year period.

From the tool they get a good overview of how the risk picture in their project looks like compared to the performance indicators. Further, the KPIs give the QRMs information whether the requirements set to the risk management process are met or not. The KPIs are based on the parameters you find in the <b>risk</b> <b>module.</b> Some theory of why a tool based on Key Performance Indicators could be valuable for the risk management process will be presented. This theory is based on standards and governing document Statoil uses.

40|$|The {{improvements}} in longevity observed {{in many countries}} {{over the past century}} have been significant. The risk that the longevity experience is higher than the one forecasted, i. e. longevity risk, is explicitly consideredin Solvency II standard formula as a sub-module of the life underwriting <b>risk</b> <b>module.</b> The life underwriting <b>risk</b> <b>module</b> includes all the life insurance and reinsurance obligations, except the SLT health insurance obligations (EIOPA 2012), where the longevity risk is one of the seven sub-modules. According to Solvency II, solvency capital requirements (from herein SCRs) can be computed by a standard formula or an internal model. Nevertheless, the scenario in which the insurance companies operate is often more complex than that one assumed by the standard formula. According to the standard formula the SCR is represented as the change in net asset value due to longevity shock which is a permanent 20 % reduction of mortality rates for all ages. A constant shock is not reasonable for all ages and maturities. The scenario related to the standard formula may lead to a biased allocation of capital, because of the volatility of longevity phenomenon in respect of different ages. In this paper we examine the adequacy of SCRs {{on the basis of the}} standard formula. To correctly calculate the solvency capital requirement we follow a multi-period approach in the sense that we evaluate at the beginning of each year the amount of capital that the insurer need to meet its future obligations year by year till the contract will be in force. We examine the adequacy of the shocks structure suggested by the standard formula studying its impact on the SCR for longevity risk (SCRLong) and liabilities at different ages...|$|E

40|$|In life {{insurance}} business, longevity risk, i. e. {{the risk that}} the insured population lives longer than the expected, represents the heart of the risk assessment, having significant impact in terms of solvency capital requirements (SCRs) needed to front the firm obligations. The credit crisis has shown that systemic risk as longevity risk is relevant and that for many insurers it is actually the dominant risk. With the adoption of the Solvency II directive, a new area for insurance in terms of solvency regulation has been opened up. The international guidelines prescribe a market consis-tent valuation of balance sheets, where the solvency capital requirements to be set aside are cal-culated according to a modular structure. By mapping the main risk affecting the insurance port-folio, the capital amount able to cover the liabilities corresponds to each measured risk. In Sol-vency II, the longevity risk is included into underwriting <b>risk</b> <b>module.</b> In particular, the rules pro-pose that companies use a standard model for measuring the SCRs. Nevertheless, the legislation under consideration allows designing tailor-made internal models.

The objective {{of this study was to}} develop and test a series of <b>risk</b> factor <b>modules</b> and corresponding patient information leaflets for secondary prevention of CHD. Methods In phase one, a series of <b>risk</b> factor <b>modules</b> and management options were developed following analysis of literature and interviews with health professionals. In phase two, module information leaflets were developed using published guidelines and interviews of people with CHD. In phase three, the leaflets were tested for quality (DISCERN), readability (Flesch) and suitability (SAM) and were compared to the existing cardiac rehabilitation (CR) information leaflet. Finally, the patients assessed the leaflets for content and relevance. Results Four key risk factors identified were cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking and physical inactivity. Choice management options were selected for each risk factor and included medical consultation, intensive health professional led program, home program and self direction. Patient information needs were then identified and leaflets were developed. DISCERN quality scores were high for cholesterol (62 / 80), blood pressure (59 / 80), smoking (62 / 80) and physical activity (62 / 80), all scoring 4 / 5 for overall rating. The mean Flesch readability score was 75, representing "fairly easy to read", all leaflets scored in the superior category for suitability and were reported to be easy to understand, useful and motivating by persons with CHD risk factors.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of a traumatic bone fracture in space is a concern due to the observed decrease in astronaut bone mineral density (BMD) during spaceflight {{and because of the}} physical demands of the mission. The Bone Fracture <b>Risk</b> <b>Module</b> (BFxRM) was developed to quantify the probability of fracture at the femoral neck and lumbar spine during space exploration missions. The BFxRM is scenario-based, providing predictions for specific activities or events during a particular space mission. The key elements of the BFxRM are the mission parameters, the biomechanical loading models, the bone loss and fracture models and the incidence rate of the activity or event. Uncertainties in the model parameters arise due to variations within the population and unknowns associated with the effects of the space environment. Consequently, parameter distributions were used in Monte Carlo simulations to obtain an estimate of fracture probability under real mission scenarios. The model predicts an increase in the probability of fracture as the mission length increases and fracture is more likely in the higher gravitational field of Mars than on the moon. The resulting probability predictions and sensitivity analyses of the BFxRM can be used as an engineering tool for mission operation and resource planning in order to mitigate the risk of bone fracture in space...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to analyze {{delinquency}} risk factors because this risk component contributed the biggest loss portion in the credit card business in Indonesia. Based on the analysis results, the delinquency <b>risk</b> <b>module</b> prototype would be developed as an enhancement of the existing credit card system using Scoring ware method. Data definition in the Scoring ware based on passed facts that create delinquency risks as the benchmark. The target of this enhancement is the customer profile and transaction authorization processing. Scoring ware results used two system concepts in Information System, that which only create supporting data (Decision Support System-DSS) and that which directly made up decision (Expert System-ES). Customer Profile Scoring ware would behave as a DSS while the customer profile score was in the judgment rating range, but it would behave as an ES while the score over the minimum rating or below the declined rating. Suspected Transaction Scoring ware always behave as an ES, because one transaction must be approved or declined in the response time limit based on the Transaction Anomaly Symptoms. Functional independence enhancement, low investments and minimum management changes were the considerations {{for the implementation of}} Scoring ware module prototype in order to minimize delinquency risk losses. The succeeds of the implementation processes were defamed by precise benchmark customer profiles and transactions, user requirement satisfied, cut off strategy and synergy of the implementation team. ...|$|E

These aspects show close spatial and temporal inter-relations. Moreover, mega-sites (hundreds of hectares wide) require properly designed Decision Support Systems (DSS). In this work, a DEcision Support sYstem for the REqualification of contaminated sites (DESYRE) is proposed for {{the identification of the}} most effective rehabilitation interventions. The DSS is based on a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework and integrates environmental and technological databases, risk assessment models, and multi criteria procedures. It is composed of five modules: (1) characterisation, (2) risk, (3) socio-economical and (4) technological analysis, and (5) decision. The characterisation module provides all the available information on the site (e. g. chemical and hydrogeological data). It can be explored by means of GIS tools and its database is available as input to statistical and geo-statistical software, as well as to hydrogeological and contaminant fate and transport models. Moreover, it provides the definition of efficient sampling strategies, definition of contaminant distribution, prediction of transport processes and input parameters for the <b>risk</b> assessment <b>module.</b> The <b>risk</b> assessment <b>module</b> includes exposure and risk assessment models and provides outputs such as risk maps.

We construct {{and implement a}} risk balance system, which consists of three modules, including a comprehensive alert processing <b>module,</b> an online <b>risk</b> assessment <b>module,</b> and a <b>risk</b> balance response decision-making module. The alert processing module improves the information quality of intrusion detection system (IDS) raw alerts by reducing false alerts rate, forming alert threads, and computing general parameters from the alert threads. The <b>risk</b> assessment <b>module</b> provides accurate evaluation of risks accordingly to alert threads. Based on the risk assessment, the response decision-making module is able to make right response decisions and perform very well in terms of noise immunization. Having advantages over conventional intrusion response systems, the risk balancer protects network servers not by directly blocking intrusion activities but by redirecting related network traffics and changing service platform. In this way, the system configurations that favor attackers are changed, and attacks are stopped with little impact on services to users. Therefore, the proposed risk balance approach is a good solution to not only the trade-off between the effectiveness and {{the negative effects of}} responses but also the false response problems caused by both IDS false-positive alerts and duplicated alerts...|$|R
