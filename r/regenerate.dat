40|$|Erasure {{correcting}} {{codes are}} widely used to ensure data persistence in distributed storage systems. This paper addresses the simultaneous repair of multiple failures in such codes. We go beyond existing work (i. e., <b>regenerating</b> codes by Dimakis et al.) by describing (i) coordinated <b>regenerating</b> codes (also known as cooperative <b>regenerating</b> codes) which support the simultaneous repair of multiple devices, and (ii) adaptive <b>regenerating</b> codes which allow adapting the parameters at each repair. Similarly to <b>regenerating</b> codes by Dimakis et al., these codes achieve the optimal tradeoff between storage and the repair bandwidth. Based on these extended <b>regenerating</b> codes, we study the impact of lazy repairs applied to <b>regenerating</b> codes and conclude that lazy repairs cannot reduce the costs in term of network bandwidth but allow reducing the disk-related costs (disk bandwidth and disk I/O).

40|$|<b>Regenerating</b> code is a {{class of}} code very {{suitable}} for distributed storage systems, which can maintain optimal bandwidth and storage space. Two types of important <b>regenerating</b> code have been constructed: the minimum storage regeneration (MSR) code and the minimum bandwidth regeneration (MBR) code. However, in hostile networks where adversaries can compromise storage nodes, the storage capacity of the network can be significantly affected. In this paper, we propose two optimal constructions of <b>regenerating</b> codes through rate-matching that can combat against this kind of adversaries in hostile networks: 2 -layer rate-matched <b>regenerating</b> code and $m$-layer rate-matched <b>regenerating</b> code. For the 2 -layer code, we can achieve the optimal storage efficiency for given system requirements. Our comprehensive analysis shows that our code can detect and correct malicious nodes with higher storage efficiency compared to the universally resilient <b>regenerating</b> code which is a straightforward extension of <b>regenerating</b> code with error detection and correction capability. Then we propose the $m$-layer code by extending the 2 -layer code and achieve the optimal error correction efficiency by matching the code rate of each layer's <b>regenerating</b> code. We also demonstrate that the optimized parameter can achieve the maximum storage capacity under the same constraint. Compared to the universally resilient <b>regenerating</b> code, our code can achieve much higher error correction efficiency. Comment: 31 pages, 7 figures, journal pape...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Distributed storage systems store a {{substantial}} amount of data and maintain data integrity by storing redundancy in a large number of storage nodes. When storage nodes fail, the lost data should be <b>regenerated</b> on replacement nodes. <b>Regenerating</b> codes minimize the volume of network traffic brought by the regeneration process. However, <b>regenerating</b> codes consume less traffic by requiring a larger number of nodes participating in the regeneration process. In this paper, we propose a new pipelined regeneration process for <b>regenerating</b> codes, that enables the system to consume a smaller amount of network traffic during the regeneration without engaging a large number of participating nodes. Moreover, the time spent during the regeneration can be further saved, while the data integrity can still be maintained no worse than the conventional regeneration process with <b>regenerating</b> codes.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Regenerating</b> code is a {{class of}} storage codes that achieve the optimal {{trade-off}} between storage capacity and repair bandwidth, which are two important performance metrics in data storage systems. However, existing constructions of <b>regenerating</b> codes rely on expensive computational operations such as finite field multiplication. The high coding and repair complexity limit their applications in large-scale practical storage systems. In this paper, we show {{that it is possible}} to achieve the full potential of <b>regenerating</b> codes with low computational complexity. In particular, we propose a new class of <b>regenerating</b> codes, called BASIC codes, that can achieve two specific points (i. e., minimum-bandwidth and minimum-storage <b>regenerating</b> points) on the storage and repair bandwidth trade-off curve, using only binary addition and shift operations in the coding and repair processes. Although in this paper we focus on constructing and analyzing BASIC codes for two specific exact-repair settings, our framework can be generalized to develop BASIC codes for more general exact- and functional-repair <b>regenerating</b> codes.
