5000|$|A <b>relative</b> <b>file</b> is a {{variation}} of the sequential file type, in which an indexing mechanism referred to as side-sectors is present to permit record-oriented access. Records may be a maximum of 254 bytes in size and are addressed by a one-based cardinal number, permitting true random access to any part of the file.|$|E
50|$|In Unix-like {{operating}} systems absolute and <b>relative</b> <b>file</b> paths differ from Windows, {{because there are}} no drive letters, Environment variables differ and / (forward slashes) are used as directory separators instead of \ (backslashes). Therefore playlists pointing to absolute paths or media files outside of the folder containing the playlist will only work for one type of operating system - either Windows or Unix-like. URLs work the same for all types.|$|E

5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and <b>relative.</b> In sequential <b>files,</b> {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique key, but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. <b>Relative</b> <b>files,</b> like indexed files, have a unique record key, {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. <b>Relative</b> <b>files</b> also allow for both sequential and random access.|$|R
40|$|File system {{performance}} {{has been greatly}} influenced by disk caching mechanisms. As the size of memory increases, common workloads {{are more likely to}} run completely from memory, and the effects of L 2 caching and underlying hardware are becoming more visible. This paper investigates performance anomalies observed when measuring and comparing the memory performance of various leading file systems. We discovered that without considering the effects of L 2 caching policy, memory footprints of file systems, states of L 2 cache, and memory page alignments, existing microbenchmarks could produce numbers that are significantly misleading and could result in poor designs and improper conclusions about <b>relative</b> <b>file</b> {{system performance}}. We recommend that the design of file system microbenchmarks for memory-rich environments should carefully consider the initial states of memory and L 2 cache, subtle warm-up effects, the cache eviction policy, interactions between workload size and the memory and cache sizes, and the management granularity of memory and the L 2 cache. ...|$|E
40|$|One {{role for}} {{workload}} generation is {{as a means}} for understanding how servers and networks respond to variation in load. This enables management and capacity planning based on current and projected usage. This paper applies a number of observations of Web serve 1 usage to create a realistic Web workload generation tool which mimics a set of real users accessing a server. The tool, called SURGE (Scalable URL Reference Generator) generates references matching empirical measurements of 1) server file size distribution; 2) request size distribution; 3) <b>relative</b> <b>file</b> popularity; 4) embedded file references; 5) temporal locality of reference; and 6) idle pcriods of individual users. This paper reviews the essential elements required in the generation of a representative Web workload. It also addresses the technical challenges to satisfying this large set of simultaneous constraints on the properties of the reference stream, the solutions we adopted, and their associated accuracy. Finally, we present evidence that SURGE exercises servers in a manner significantly different from other Web server benchmarks. 1...|$|E

50|$|After {{her brother}} William died in 1979, Dolly Banks {{took over as}} General Manager. William Banks had no children, so several distant <b>relatives</b> <b>filed</b> lawsuits, {{fighting}} for ownership of WWDB and WHAT. In 1985, Dolly Banks retired after the African-American employees of sister station WHAT, along with the Black Media Caucus in Washington, D.C., sued the estate, receiving {{millions of dollars and}} forcing an estate sale of WWDB. The sale, which was overseen by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), required the stations to go to black ownership. WWDB was sold to Ragen Henry, a black Philadelphia attorney, for an undervalued amount of $6 million. Henry's law firm had worked for the Banks family. Irv Homer had to testify before the FCC.|$|R

Besides the benefits, it provides a new environment and convenience for network crime, which results difficulties and challenges for forensic investigation.

Through investigating from cloud and client aspects, we collect <b>relative</b> log <b>files</b> and communicated data packages, which can succeed to monitor network and store original crime behaviors. 1...|$|R

5000|$|On July 6, 1885, {{probate judge}} R. H. Lewis {{ruled in favor}} of the will. In November 1885, the trial in the Superior Court of Hancock County began, with the {{eventual}} ruling siding with Amanda America and her two sons. Then, in March 1886, the white <b>relatives</b> <b>filed</b> their appeal with the Supreme Court of Georgia. On October 11, 1886, chief justice James Jackson, and associate justices Samuel Hall and Mark Blanford heard the case following the appeal. James Jackson expressed his firm conviction against upholding the will, saying, [...] "I would rather died in my place than uphold the will." [...] A few days later he became ill with pneumonia and died. Judge Logan E. Bleckley filled his vacancy and then refused to hear the case again. Associate justices Samuel Hall and Mark Blanford remained to deliver the ruling regarding if the white relatives would receive a new trial. Ultimately, eight months later on June 13, 1887, Samuel Hall and Mark Blanford of the Georgia Supreme Court also {{ruled in favor of}} Amanda America and her two sons, formally settling the dispute of David Dickson's will. Citing the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, saying that the rights and privileges of a black woman and her children would be the same rights and privileges of a white concubine or an illegitimate white woman and her children. So, the same laws governed the rights and privileges of women of both races.|$|R
