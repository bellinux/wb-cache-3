5|$|A {{course of}} antiretrovirals {{administered}} within 48 to 72hours after exposure to HIV-positive blood or genital secretions {{is referred to}} as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). The use of the single agent zidovudine <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of a HIV infection five-fold following a needle-stick injury. As of 2013, the prevention regimen recommended in the United States consists of three medications—tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir—as this may reduce the risk further.|$|E

With the use of explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition.

5|$|Acamprosate may {{stabilise}} {{the brain}} chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising {{the actions of}} glutamate, a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the post-withdrawal phase.

Acamprosate <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of relapse amongst alcohol dependent persons.|$|E
5|$|Although {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} J.lagostoma are almost exclusively terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic. In order to release their offspring, the adults therefore have to {{migrate to the}} sea, as seen in other land crabs, such as the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. In {{most members of the}} family Gecarcinidae, migration coincides with the rainy season, which <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of desiccation; migration in J.lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May.|$|E
5|$|In ambient {{pressure}} diving, the diver is directly {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The {{ambient pressure}} diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E

5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E

5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin's {{popularity}} declined {{after the}} development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects, while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of clotting diseases. Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last {{decades of the twentieth}} century, and remain strong in the twenty-first with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% {{over the long}} term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some {{evidence to suggest that}} female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E

40|$|Objective 　To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} modest alcohol consumption and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of fatty liver disease (FLD) or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods 　PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Digital Journal Full-text Database, and database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP) till Nov. 2015 were searched for the studies in evaluating the effect of alcohol consumption on FLD or NAFLD. The quality assessment of included studies was performed according to the combined evaluation for cross-sectional studies and Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for cohort studies. A meta-analysis was performed using Stata 12. 0 software. Results 　A total of 16 studies including 13 cross-sectional studies, 2 cross-sectional following longitudinal studies, and 1 cohort study with 76 967 participants were selected finally. The results of Meta-analysis were as follows. Minimal and light alcohol consumptions <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> for FLD or NAFLD by 17 % and 27 %, respectively, and moderate alcohol consumption was marginally associated with decreased risk for FLD or NAFLD. The results of subgroup analysis by gender showed that (1) Minimal and light alcohol consumptions <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD by 29 % and 33 %, respectively, but moderate alcohol consumption {{was not statistically significant}} in <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD in females compared with controls; (2) Light alcohol consumption <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD by 23 %, but minimal and moderate alcohol consumptions were not statistically significant in <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD in male compared with controls; (3) Light and moderate alcohol consumptions in Asian males <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD by 29. 7 % and 30. 3 %, respectively. Conclusions 　Modest alcohol consumptions may not increase <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD. Inversely, minimal and light alcohol consumptions in female <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD remarkably, and light to moderate alcohol consumption in males, especially in Asian males, can also significantly <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD.

Yearly vaccinations against influenza are {{recommended by the}} World Health Organization for those at high risk. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, {{have been used to}} treat influenza.

5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English.

5|$|Weight {{loss and}} eating {{difficulties}} due to dysphagia and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly {{important as the}} disease advances. Thickening agents {{can be added to}} liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow. Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking. If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is available. This is a feeding tube, permanently attached through the abdomen into the stomach, which <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of aspirating food and provides better nutritional management. Assessment and management by speech-language pathologists with experience in Huntington's disease is recommended.|$|E
5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E
5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} {{less than eight}} hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is {{a sharp decline in}} its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E
