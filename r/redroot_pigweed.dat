The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, <b>redroot</b> <b>pigweed</b> (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv.

Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity.

50|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.Ailanthus produces an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits the growth of other plants.

Prominent volunteer species were annual foxtails (Setaria spp. Beauv.), <b>redroot</b> <b>pigweed</b> (Amaranthus retroflexus SSL.), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.), and common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.).

Annual foxtails were grazed completely while heifers mainly stripped leaves and defoliated the tops of red root pigweed. <b>Redroot</b> <b>pigweed</b> and annual foxtails were randomly collected within blocks during both grazing seasons to quantify forage value. Foliage (upper stem and leaves) was analyzed for crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD). <b>Redroot</b> <b>pigweed</b> foliage and leaves were analyzed for nitrate (N 03).

However, in 2011, post-emergence applications of flumioxazin caused significant crop injury and yield reduction. The results of this study indicate that satisfactory control of field bindweed and <b>redroot</b> <b>pigweed,</b> as well as high potato yield can be obtained by the pre-emergence application of flumioxazin or sulfosulfuron at 72 to 144 g ai ha- 1, without herbicide residues on potato tubers...|$|E
40|$|To model light {{interception}} {{and distribution}} in the mixed canopy of <b>redroot</b> <b>pigweed</b> (Amaranthus rertoflexus) with corn, an experiment {{was carried out in}} randomized complete blocks design with factorial arrangement in Gonabad during 2006 - 2007 and 2007 - 2008 growing seasons. The factors used in this experiment was consisted of three corn densities (7. 5, 8. 5 and 9. 5 plants per meter of row) and three densities of <b>redroot</b> <b>pigweed</b> (zero, 2, 4, 6 and 8 plants per meter of row). INTERCOM model was used through replacing parabolic function with triangular function of leaf area density. Vertical distribution of the species� leaf area showed that corn had concentrated the most leaf area in layer of 50 to 150 cm, while <b>redroot</b> <b>pigweed</b> has concentrated in 40 - 60 cm of canopy height. Model sensitivity analysis showed that leaf area index, species� height, height where maximum leaf area is seen (hm), and extinction coefficient had influenced on light interception rate of any species. In both species, the distribution density of leaf area at the canopy length fit a triangular function, and the height in which maximum leaf area was observed change by increasing the density. There was a correlation between percentage of the radiation absorbed by the weed and percentage of corn seed yield loss (r 2 = 0. 89). Ideal type of corn was determined until the stage of tasseling in competition with weed. This determination indicates that the corn needs more height and leaf area, as well as less extinction coefficient to successfully fight against the weed...|$|E

Clear morphological differences were observed between adult thale cress plants exposed to citral in two different application methods: spraying and watering. Citral-sprayed and citral-watered thale cress plants showed completely different effects after treatment, suggesting that foliar or root absorption can determin. The effectiveness of this compound.
