40|$|International audiencePhototoxicity {{inducing}} in vivo photoirritation, a <b>reversible</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reaction</b> of {{the skin}} after chemical contact and UVA radiation exposure, is increasingly observed as a side effect {{associated with the use}} of both cosmetics and systemic drugs. In order to systematically screen for the phototoxic potential of new compounds, we propose two three-dimensional models suitable for in vitro testing: a dermal equivalent (DE) and a skin equivalent (SE) model. The DE model includes a collagen-glycosaminoglycans-chitosan porous matrix populated by normal human fibroblasts. The SE model is made by seeding normal human keratinocytes onto the DE, leading to a fully differentiated epidermis. The objectives of this pilot study are: 1) to compare the deleterious effects of UVA radiation on the two models and 2) to evaluate to what extent the in vitro results can predict the in vivo phototoxicity caused by well-known photoirritant compounds, included in the COLIPA validation phototoxicity reference chemical list. Dilutions of thiourea, sulisobenzone, promethazine, chlorpromazine and tetracycline were applied (20 microliters) onto DEs and SEs (n = 6) and incubated for 1 h (or 15 h) at 37 degrees C. Irradiated samples received 3 J/cm 2 UVA. The 24 h post-irradiation residual cellular viability was measured using the MTT test on treated and untreated tissues and IL- 1 alpha release measurement in collected SE culture media. A concordance in terms of photoirritant/non-photoirritant was obtained between the in vivo data and the in vitro results, suggesting that the DE and the SE models could be integrated, after a complete validation study, into a protocol for in vitro testing of the photoirritant potential of new molecules.

40|$|Peri-implantitis is an {{inflammatory}} process, which is initiated by a biofilm-induced pathway causing a <b>reversible</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reaction</b> {{in the soft}} tissues surrounding the implant; however, it may progress into irreversible damage in the surrounding alveolar bone and result in loss of attachment. Modelling any kind of oral biofilm is challenging as up to 700 species have been identified on various surfaces within the mouth. Thus, also data on bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on dental implant surfaces is limited and mostly based on identification of species. However, knowledge about this process, in particular in its early stages, {{is essential for the}} development of strategies to prevent and control microbial adherence and biofilm formation. The aims of this study were (i) to develop and validate a flow chamber model to assess peri-implantitis related multispecies biofilm formation; (ii) to test antimicrobial susceptibility of this biofilm; (iii) to evaluate the reliability of commonly used methods and novel isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) analyses for vitality testing of adherent microorganisms in vitro. An in vitro flow chamber model was developed to study single- and multispecies adhesion to protein-coated surface in reduced nutrient conditions that mimic the clinical situation of peri-implant disease. Adherent single-species model with S. sanguinis was used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Original study 1 in Chapter 4) to answer two questions: firstly, how efficient is disinfectant treatment and secondly, to identify discrepancies between the results revealed by different vitality detection methods (commonly applied: staining by Live/dead Baclight kit, conventional culturing; and a novel approach by IMC). Chlorhexidine has been considered for many years the standard in oral infection control, however, the three other disinfectants (povidone-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide) showed comparable efficacy against the adherent microorganism. The interpretation of the results of staining and traditional culturing is difficult as major discrepancies were present. The disagreement between the results of the methods can be attributed to different aspects: (i) staining is based on the destruction or integrity of the cell wall; (ii) conventional culturing requires bacteria to be re-suspended prior to cultivation and subsequent quantification of colony-forming units. However, several factors – such as physical damage to the cells by re-suspension or lack of growth due to suboptimal culture conditions – may cause false negative results; (iii) the population of cells that are viable but not cultivable (VBNC), but are still present by staining and microscopy. The IMC is a very sensitive method, which detects heat-flow from all metabolic processes in any living microorganism. The principle of the method is that all living systems produce heat and heat release can be measured calorimetrically without any interference with the processes. In other words, IMC measures heat production or consumption, which is proportional to the rate at which any given chemical, physical or biological process is taking place (i. e., metabolic heat from bacterial growth). Our results on adherent disinfectant-treated S. sanguinis indicate that IMC is a useful tool to avoid the problem with VBNC cells and provides a novel approach in oral microbiology that detects reliably all the cells that are able to resuscitate after disinfectant treatment and thereby may lead to the expression of virulence factors in the colonized sites. In order to study antimicrobial efficacy on a more complex system, a 72 -hour biofilm model including S. sanguinis, F. nucelatum and P. gingivalis was created (Original study 2 in Chapter 5). After 72 h, the three species were always detected with similar proportions throughout experiments by microscopic methods. Even, when such stability in the proportions and structure was found, the metabolic activity of biofilms in IMC revealed high heterogeneity. Thus, this heterogeneity suggests that bacteria appear to have intra-species variance affecting their behaviour in biofilms, which is dependent on different factors that are hitherto not well understood. IMC analysis of the behaviour of the three-species biofilm provided a novel opportunity to observe how an intact biofilm acts as an entity when exposed to antibiotics (Original study 3 in Chapter 6). The clinical efficacy of adjuvant antibiotic therapy in the periimplantitis treatment is unclear; in order to gain better understanding the most frequently used antibiotics: amoxicillin, metronidazole and their combination were tested. Additionally, in order to obtain comparable data to the previously published information (Chapter 4), the vitality of adherent single-species of S. sanguinis and P. gingivalis after antibiotic treatment was assessed by vitality staining, conventional culturing and IMC. The results of staining and culturing correlated poorly. This can be due to reasons mentioned earlier, such as limitations of the methods and VBNC cells, but can also be due to the bacteriostatic effects of antibiotics that cannot be reliably detected by staining. Although amoxicillin and metronidazole are considered bactericidal, IMC results suggest that when applied alone, the antibiotics seem to work primarily through bacteriostatic effects; when combined, the efficacy is increased by their synergistic bactericidal action. Furthermore, this indicates that it might not be possible to strictly divide the effects of antibiotics into bacteriostatic and bactericidal, as the results here imply that the effect seems to be dependent on their concentration and combination plus the nature of targeted cells. In conclusion, this study emphasises the need to critically evaluate the results of live/dead staining and conventional culturing as many aspects can affect the outcome of these methods leading to miscalculations on the proportion of cells that are able to resuscitate and express virulence factors on treated sites. Thus, as a novel alternative in oral biofilm research IMC gives new insights helping to monitor the efficacy and dynamics of biofilms and their antimicrobial susceptibility in vitro...|$|E

The lateral surface of the tube was used as negative control. The <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reaction</b> to contact with the sealers was classified as absent, mild, moderate and severe. At 7 days, all sealers caused similar <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reactions</b> in the connective tissue of the animals, with most specimens presenting a moderate to intense chronic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reaction,</b> with presence of multinucleated giant cells.

There was no prominent difference in the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reactions</b> following injection of 2 % CMC solution into a 4 -day-old air pouch and a 3 -day-old CMC pouch.

Two groups of rabbits infected with S. typhimurium were studied: normal animals and animals pretreated with nitrogen mustard. Nitrogen mustard depletes the polymorphonuclear leukocyte pool and thereby prevents the formation of an acute <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reaction.</b> In vivo ligated ileal loops were constructed and infected 72 h after nitrogen mustard administration when polymorphonuclear leukocytes were undetectable. Nitrogen mustard treatment markedly inhibited salmonella-induced secretion.

The antisecretory effect of nitrogen mustard was not merely a nonspecific effect since nitrogen mustard treatment did not inhibit cholera toxin-induced secretion and did not alter either ileal morphology nor the activities of various intestinal enzymes in normal animals. Nitrogen mustard also did not alter the virulence of the inoculated S. typhimurium.

40|$|Inflammatory {{mediators}} such as the vasoactive and chemotactic factors, {{which are}} formed during the activation of serum complement, are extremely potent biologic peptides and {{are thought to be}} under the rigid control of specific serum-derived regulators or inactivators, including the anaphylatoxin inactivator (AI) and the chemotactic factor inactivator (CFI). Our understanding of the biologic importance and implication of these regulators in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reactions</b> is primarily based on in vitro observations, and there is only limited data on their in vivo importance. Previously, alterations in CFI and AI levels were detected in chronic inflammatory disease states, but no data on their activity or role during acute <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reactions</b> have been demonstrated. Here we demonstrate the elevation of serum CFI activity during acute <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reactions</b> in rabbits. Specifically, <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reactions</b> were induced in rabbits by intraperitoneal injections of 0. 1 % oyster glycogen. Rabbit serum CFI levels rose rapidly over the first 4 hours after glycogen injection, reaching levels 4 - 8 times higher than the preglycogen serum CFI levels. Additional studies demonstrated that acute elevations of serum CFI levels could also be induced in rabbits by intravenous infusion of activated rabbit serum or C 5 -derived chemotactic factors. Infusion of saline, albumin, or the synthetic chemotactic peptide f-Met-Leu-Phe did not cause elevation of the serum CFI levels in rabbits. Thus, we take these data to support our hypothesis that 1) CFI is a “hyperacute phase reactant” that is elevated during <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reactions,</b> and 2) that this elevation of serum CFI activity is probably triggered by the appearance of specific C 5 -derived chemotactic factors within the vasculature.

40|$|<b>Inflammatory</b> <b>reactions</b> are {{believed}} to be triggered by innate signals and have a major protective role by recruiting innate immunity cells, favoring lymphocyte activation and differentiation, and thus contributing to the sequestration and elimination of the injurious stimuli. Although certain lymphocyte types such as TH 17 cells co-participate in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reactions,</b> their generation from the na&# 239;ve pool requires the pre-existence of an inflammatory milieu. In this context, inflammation is always regarded as beginning with an innate response that may be eventually perpetuated and amplified by certain lymphocyte types. In contrast, we here show that even in sterile immunizations or in MyD 88 deficient mice, CD 8 T cells produce a burst of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These functions follow opposite rules to the classic CD 8 effector functions since they are generated prior to cell expansion and decline before antigen elimination. As few as 56 CD 8 + inflammatory effector cells in a lymph node can mobilize 107 cells in 24 h, including lymphocytes, natural killer cells and several accessory cell types involved in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reactions.</b> Thus, although inflammation modulates cognate responses, CD 8 cognate responses also initiate local <b>inflammatory</b> <b>reactions...</b>|$|R
