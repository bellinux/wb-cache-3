25|$|In 1980, the fee was {{increased}} to S$5, but in 1989 it was reduced back to S$3, {{due to the}} fact that now more vehicles were paying. In 1994, two levels of licence fees were established, to differentiate between daily permits and inter-peak licences. The paper licences vary in shape depending on the class of vehicle, and their colours varied from one month to another to deter fraud. The colour-coded licences also made it easier for the enforcement personnel to identify the vehicles during the restricted hours. For reason of traffic management, violating vehicles were not stopped at the gantries, but their number plates were taken down and their owner would <b>receive</b> <b>an</b> <b>order</b> to appear in court to pay the fine. The control was made only at the gantries, therefore, vehicles were free to move around or leave the RZ without having to pay the fee.|$|E

500|$|The {{fighting}} went {{no better}} for the French on their left. Decaen's advanced guard proceeded forward, albeit cautiously. [...] Austrian marksmen fired down upon the column, and Decaen fell from his horse, injured. Beaupuy took Decaen's place with the advance guard. At midday, Latour abandoned his customary caution and sent two columns to attack Beaupuy between Malterdingen and Höllental (Val d'Enfer), resulting in a fierce firefight. After giving an order to retreat along the Elz, Beaupuy was killed and his division did not <b>receive</b> <b>an</b> <b>order</b> to retreat, causing additional losses for the French.|$|E
5000|$|On 8 December 1942, the Maritime Commission {{contracted}} for 69 Tacoma-class ships, {{for which}} the U.S. Navy dropped the British [...] "corvette" [...] designation in favor of classifying the Tacomas (along with the two Asheville-class ships that preceded them) as [...] "patrol gunboats" [...] (PG); on 15 April 1943, the two Ashevilles and all Tacomas were reclassified as [...] "patrol frigates" [...] (PF).

500|$|Canopus {{departed}} the Abrolhos Rocks on 8 October 1914 {{to assist}} Cradock's ships {{in searching for}} the German East Asia Squadron of Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, which was en route the South Atlantic from the Far East. Canopus arrived at Stanley in the Falkland Islands on 18 October 1914, where she took up guard ship and escort duties. Cradock had initially intended to take Canopus with his squadron, which consisted of the armoured cruisers [...] and , the light cruiser Glasgow and the auxiliary cruiser , but her late arrival, coupled {{with the fact that}} she required an overhaul upon arriving in the Falklands, forced Cradock to proceed without her. In addition, Canopus could make no more than , which would have made it difficult for Cradock to force the East Asia Squadron into battle. Cradock ordered Canopus to join him when possible, though he intended to use her only to protect his colliers. On 27 October, Cradock detached his light cruiser [...] to Coronel to gather intelligence, and the next day ordered Canopus to bring the colliers to the Juan Fernández Islands, where his squadron would replenish its fuel. Glasgow arrived in Coronel on 31 October, but departed too early on 1 November to <b>receive</b> <b>an</b> <b>order</b> from the First Sea Lord that Cradock should not risk engaging Spee's squadron without Canopus.|$|E

This mistake (the surveyor proving to be in the wrong) displeased the Indians; the dispute arose to that height, that the Chief and his party had determined to break up the business, and return the shortest way home, and forbad the surveyors to proceed any farther: however, after some delay, the complaisance and prudent conduct of the Colonel made them change their resolution; the Chief became reconciled, upon condition that the compass should be discarded, and rendered incapable of serving on this business; that the Chief himself should lead the survey; and, moreover, <b>receive</b> <b>an</b> <b>order</b> for a very considerable quantity of goods." ...|$|E

Its non-acceptance or discredit results always from some form of ignorance or dishonour: so far as such interruptions rise out of differences in denomination, there is no ground for their continuance among civilized nations. It may be convenient in one country to use chiefly copper for coinage, in another silver, and in another gold,--reckoning accordingly in centimes, francs, or zecchins: but that a franc should be different in weight and value from a shilling, and a zwanziger vary from both, is wanton loss of commercial power.|$|E
