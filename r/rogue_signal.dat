30|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrated}} the RSF intrusion, a new threat to trust-based CSS protocols. The attackers can transmit <b>rogue</b> <b>signals</b> onto groups of sensors to emulate SSDF and ruin their reputation {{with the intent}} of having them removed from the shared spectrum sensing. Our work cautions the use of trust-based CSS protocols and warrants a line of defense against <b>rogue</b> <b>signals.</b> The RSF simulations were conducted in a realistic environment based on the 802.22 WRAN standard and illustrates the impact of the RSF intrusions on sensor reputation scores. To mitigate the trust damage, we introduced a new defense based on community detection and cluster analysis. The simulation experiments showed that our defense solution, the RCD module, could effectively keep the sensor reputations intact while distinguishing <b>rogue</b> <b>signals</b> from malicious sensors.|$|R
30|$|To launch this attack, we exploit {{directional}} antennas {{to launch}} <b>rogue</b> <b>signals</b> on a regional group of sensors and thereby {{causing them to}} report abnormally high RSS compared {{to the rest of}} the unaffected network. When sensors start reporting differently, the FC interprets the situation as an SSDF attack, when in fact, the sensors reported honestly. In essence, we can use <b>rogue</b> <b>signals</b> to emulate false SSDF attacks to harm innocent sensors and mitigate their cooperation in shared spectrum sensing.|$|R
30|$|Clancy et al. [6] {{warns of}} a similar threat of <b>rogue</b> <b>signals,</b> but in a {{different}} context. They claim that <b>rogue</b> <b>signals</b> can cause faulty statistics, collected from the physical layer (e.g., RSS, channel availability, etc.), and stored in the knowledge base. The cognitive radio’s behavior {{is determined by the}} learning and reasoning engines which, in turn, depends on the knowledge base of spectrum observations across many channels overtime. Hence, the cognitive radio may not behave as intended, or in fact cause harm, when the knowledge base contains faulty statistics that inhibits good decision-making. Both our work and theirs [6] express the importance of being able to defend against <b>rogue</b> <b>signals.</b> The difference, however, is that our work protects the sensor reputations in trust-based CSS protocols whereas their idea is related towards protecting the integrity of the knowledge base.|$|R
3000|$|Rogue signals {{can raise}} a sensor’s RSS well above what is expected, {{especially}} {{in the absence of}} the primary signal. So a prolonged <b>rogue</b> <b>signal</b> on a group of sensors can cause a sharp contrast in local spectrum observation from the others, thus appearing malicious and no different than SSDF. Consequently, the security protocol brands these sensors as untrustworthy and removes them from the shared spectrum analysis for as long as the stigma remains. As such, launching rogue signals on specific regions of the network over many quiet periods leads to the exploitation of the trust model via the RSF attack. In the context of CSS, we define the term <b>Rogue</b> <b>Signal</b> Framing attack as follows: [...]...|$|E

When a <b>rogue</b> <b>signal</b> is present, the red graph should be surrounded by the blue graph, outlining {{the reach of the}} rogue signal’s antenna coverage.|$|E
30|$|There {{are many}} {{variables}} in our simulations {{that are worth}} analyzing at a more comprehensive level. The number of sensors, the number of attackers, the shape {{and size of the}} <b>rogue</b> <b>signal,</b> the network’s topology, and even the environment’s landscape. In future studies, we intend to explore how these variables impact our solution and to establish metrics that fit the parameters according to different scenarios.|$|E

30|$|To test our hypothesis, we {{simulated}} multiple directional <b>rogue</b> <b>signals</b> against targeted clusters in {{a cognitive}} radio network. The simulation illustrated {{the impact of}} <b>rogue</b> <b>signals</b> negatively affecting sensor reputations which, in severe cases, shows roughly 40 % of sensors penalized and eventually ignored in the shared spectrum sensing process. In other words, {{nearly half of the}} sensors were removed without any fault of their own, e.g., the sensors were not malfunctioning nor behaving maliciously but were still penalized. That means an outsider has the potential to trick the reputation scheme in order to filter out nearly half of the sensors, thus diminishing the performance of the network’s shared spectrum sensing. Trust-based CSS protocols have proven effective against malicious secondary users who report falsified sensing reports, but they did not consider the impact of <b>rogue</b> <b>signals.</b> Hence, based on the outcome of our simulations, we consider trust models as overly sensitive intrusion detection systems (IDS) for penalizing sensors without taking into account the root cause of abnormal sensor reports.|$|R

30|$|Soft-decision {{combining}} {{not only}} benefits from using more descriptive data but also becomes {{more vulnerable to}} outliers in sensor reports, e.g., extremely high or low RSS values. Generally, CSS protocols are designed to reduce the impact of outliers or remove them entirely, but this still leaves the majority of sensor reports as a strong determinant of the global spectrum decision, just like in hard-decision combining. That is, a majority of sensors will typically decide the global decision, even if that majority is comprised of malicious sensors or affected by a wide-reaching <b>rogue</b> <b>signal,</b> {{as seen in the}} case of a PUE attack. In such a case, the FC concludes that the disagreeing minority of sensors, even if well-behaved, are presumed inaccurate.|$|E
30|$|This section {{introduces}} the RSF clustering defense (RCD) module that operates in three steps: 1) analyze the RSS diversity for any clustering behavior, 2) compute the clustering strength {{in order to}} conlude {{the presence of a}} <b>rogue</b> <b>signal,</b> and if so 3) ignore trust penalties of sensors in the attacked clusters. The defense relies on the fact that directional antennas leave isolated radiation patterns that form dense communities of sensors reporting H 1. Malicious sensors can perform SSDF attacks from the software layer without the need of rogue signals and thus operates outside the physical limitations of signal properties. In contrast, the RSF attack coverage is bound by the rogue signal’s radiation pattern. Hence, we look towards a solution involving cluster analysis to exploit the rogue signal’s physical characteristics and the finger print it leaves behind in a region of the network.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} year, two Rogue GPS {{prototype}} receivers have been assembled and successfully {{subjected to a}} variety of laboratory and field tests. A functional description is presented of signal processing in the Rogue receiver, tracing the signal from RF input to the output values of group delay, phase, and data bits. The receiver can track up to eight satellites, without time multiplexing among satellites or channels, simultaneously measuring both group delay and phase for each of three channels (L 1 -C/A, L 1 -P, L 2 -P). The <b>Rogue</b> <b>signal</b> processing described requires generation of the code for all three channels. Receiver functional design, which emphasized accuracy, reliability, flexibility, and dynamic capability, is summarized.

30|$|Naturally, {{the size}} and {{topology}} of the cognitive radio network {{has an effect on}} our RCD solution. A dense network can easily show patterns of <b>rogue</b> <b>signals</b> where as a sparse network gives less information to analyze. To show the difference, we tested our solution on a second network, denoted as the sparse network, consisting of 100 randomly placed sensors. In contrast, the dense network has 400 randomly placed sensors, which is the same network tested and discussed in previous sections. For both dense and sparse networks, we only display the RSF- 45 scenario {{to limit the number of}} graphs. The RSF- 45 scenario emits four <b>rogue</b> <b>signals</b> in the cardinal directions with 45 ° beamwidth.|$|R
30|$|Prior to this section, type 1 framing {{has been}} the {{designated}} type of trust manipulation to describe the RSF attack. Type 2 framing, {{which is also a}} result of <b>rogue</b> <b>signals,</b> is worthy of discussion for simultaneously accomplishing a PUE attack and harming sensor reputations. Both attacks are manifested through <b>rogue</b> <b>signals</b> but can only be distinguished by the attack’s outcome, such as misleading the trust model (via RSF attack) or the FC (via PUE attack). To our knowledge, the fact that a PUE attack may inadvertently affect sensor reputations has not yet been considered in previous literature. We believe that type 2 framing is important in that it highlights the more subtle deficiencies in trust models, like how PUE attacks can also harm sensor reputations as a side effect.|$|R

30|$|The red {{and blue}} graph both give {{valuable}} information in detecting directional rogue signals by the cluster formations they create. The goal of the red graph is to identify a strong concentration of sensors perceiving a radio signal within a small area. In contrast, the blue graph demonstrates disagreements in spectrum decisions (i.e., H 0 and H 1) between neighboring sensors. As {{can be seen in}} the RSF scenario in Figure 9 a, the red graphs (created by the rogue signals) is surrounded by the blue graph and lacks any significant overlap between the two graphs. The presence of a red graph, without the intersections of blue edges, outlines a radio’s antenna coverage and becomes a clear indication of a <b>rogue</b> <b>signal.</b> However, the SSDF scenario in Figure 9 b shows that an overlapping of {{red and blue}} graphs reveal a strong likelihood of malicious or malfunctioning sensors, instead of a rogue signal’s presence, since there is no apparent pattern of spectrum decisions.|$|E
30|$|What {{makes our}} {{solution}} unique {{is that our}} defense protects the integrity of trust models, i.e., sensor reputations, from <b>rogue</b> <b>signal</b> manipulation. Previous literature used trust models to stop malicious SUs (and their sensors) from deceiving the CSS, but did not consider the trust models themselves to be the target of attacks. Trust models were considered reliable solutions against SSDF attacks and malfunctioning sensors, but to our knowledge, none of the papers discussed how to manipulate and disrupt trust models. We realized the vulnerability of trust models due to their coarse threshold of penalizing inaccurate sensor reports, i.e., a sensor is deemed untrustworthy {{if it does not}} behave in a predetermined way. However, if an attacker knows how the sensors should behave, then they can leverage rogue signals to disrupt typical sensor behavior and thus destroy their reputations. To protect sensor reputations, we explored techniques from social network analytics, such as cluster analysis and community detection, as opposed to relying on RSS models or shadow fading estimations to predict the correct sensor report.|$|E
30|$|Unfortunately, we {{find that}} the sensor reputations are exploitable by rogue signals in trust-based CSS protocols. In {{secondary}} networks, {{it is very hard to}} conclude the root cause of bad sensor reports such as malfunctioning sensors, the hidden node problem, SSDF attacks, and rogue signals. Typically, trust models (from CSS protocols) treat all inaccurate sensors the same way, in a loss of reputation. We consider trust models as overly sensitive intrusion detection systems (IDS) for penalizing sensors without taking into account the root cause of the abnormal sensor reports. As a result, attackers can cause inaccurate sensor reports by transmitting rogue signals in order to destroy the reputation of the targeted sensors. Accordingly, we present a new threat to a variety of trust-based CSS protocols, named the <b>Rogue</b> <b>Signal</b> Framing (RSF) intrusion. To launch this attack, we exploit directional antennas to isolate a radiation pattern to a group of sensors in proximity. The outcome is the emulation of an SSDF attack through sporadic and misleading rogue signals, causing different conclusions of channel availability in the network. The split between local spectrum decisions leads to innocent sensors being treated as malicious and consequently removed from the shared spectrum sensing.|$|E
30|$|In this section, {{we define}} the RSS {{model and the}} method of attack for the RSF which employs {{directional}} antennas. The attacker manipulates sensor reputations by transmitting <b>rogue</b> <b>signals</b> to targeted sensors, thus causing conflicting sensor reports in the network.

30|$|Cognitive radios are {{currently}} presented {{as the solution}} to the ever-increasing spectrum shortage problem. However, their increased capabilities over traditional radios introduce a new dimension of security threats. Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) has been proposed as a means to protect cognitive radio networks from the well-known security threats: primary user emulation (PUE) and spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF). In this paper, we demonstrate a new threat to CSS protocols that rely on sensor reputations, called the <b>Rogue</b> <b>Signal</b> Framing (RSF) intrusion. Rogue signals can be exploited to create the illusion of malicious sensors which leads to the framing of innocent sensors and, consequently, their removal from the shared spectrum sensing. Ultimately, with fewer sensors working together, the spectrum sensing is less robust for making correct spectrum access decisions. The simulation experiments illustrate the impact of RSF intrusions which, in severe cases, shows roughly 40 % of sensors removed. To counter the RSF’s impact on the cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS), we introduce a new defense based on cluster analysis and community detection from analyzing the network’s received signal strength (RSS) diversity. Tests show up to 95 % damage mitigation to the integrity of sensor reputations, thus retaining the benefits of trust-based CSS protocols.|$|E

30|$|Directional antennas are {{difficult}} to detect, and even harder to pinpoint, because {{of their ability to}} emit <b>rogue</b> <b>signals</b> with narrow and asymmetrical radiation patterns. Any changes made to the beam direction and beamwidth of a directional antenna can drastically change the network’s RSS spatial diversity. These observations are supported by work from Bauer et al. [31]. In their experiments, they demonstrated that directional antennas can disrupt localization algorithms on IEEE 802.11 WLANs that resulted in very high errors.|$|R
30|$|According to {{the first}} CRN standard, the IEEE 802.22, the {{secondary}} network must be self-reliant in minimizing interference to the primary network which requires accurate spectrum analysis [18]. In the case of SSDF attacks, trust models have been effective at removing malicious sensors from the shared spectrum sensing [13 – 17]. However, these trust models cannot distinguish between malicious sensors and accurate sensors misled by <b>rogue</b> <b>signals</b> (as opposed to the legitimate primary signal).

40|$|Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) are a next {{generation}} network {{that is expected to}} solve the wireless spectrum shortage problem, which is the shrinking of available wireless spectrum resources needed to facilitate future wireless applications. The first CRN standard, the IEEE 802. 22, addresses this particular problem by allowing CRNs to share geographically unused TV spectrum to mitigate the spectrum shortage. Equipped with reasoning and learning engines, cognitive radios operate autonomously to locate unused channels to maximize its own bandwidth and Quality-of-Service (QoS). However, their increased capabilities over traditional radios introduce a new dimension of security threats. In an NSF 2009 workshop, the FCC raised the question, “What authentication mechanisms are needed to support cooperative cognitive radio networks? Are reputation-based schemes useful supplements to conventional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication protocols?” Reputation-based schemes in cognitive radio networks are a popular technique for performing robust and accurate spectrum sensing without any inter-communication with licensed networks, but the question remains on how effective they are at satisfying the FCC security requirements. Our work demonstrates that trust-based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) protocols are vulnerable to <b>rogue</b> <b>signals,</b> which creates the illusion of inside attackers and raises the concern that such schemes are overly sensitive Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The erosion of the sensor reputations in trust-based CSS protocols makes CRNs vulnerable to future attacks.

An important question we wanted to investigate was, ‘Should the trust-based CSS protocols treat all inaccurate sensor reports the same way, regardless of the root cause? Or does it cause more harm than good to the system in certain scenarios’.|$|R
