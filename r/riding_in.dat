5|$|On 29 May 1842, Victoria was <b>riding</b> <b>in</b> a {{carriage}} along The Mall, London, when John Francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire; he escaped.

On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life, John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail. In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London.
