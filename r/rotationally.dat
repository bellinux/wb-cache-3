5|$|In a liquid, powder or {{amorphous}} sample, molecules {{within that}} sample are in random orientations. Such samples have a continuous Fourier spectrum that uniformly spreads its amplitude {{thereby reducing the}} measured signal intensity, as is observed in SAXS. More importantly, the orientational information is lost. Although theoretically possible, it is experimentally difficult to obtain atomic-resolution structures of complicated, asymmetric molecules from such <b>rotationally</b> averaged data. An intermediate case is fiber diffraction in which the subunits are arranged periodically {{in at least one}} dimension.|$|E
5|$|For illustration, if a {{physical}} system behaves the same, {{regardless of how}} it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are <b>rotationally</b> symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system {{is responsible for the}} conservation law. As another example, if {{a physical}} experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War, Fred Hoyle worked on the problem of how the various observed elements in the universe were produced. In 1946 he proposed that a massive star could generate the necessary thermonuclear reactions, and the nuclear reactions of heavy elements were responsible for the removal of energy necessary for a gravitational collapse to occur. The collapsing star became <b>rotationally</b> unstable, and produced an explosive expulsion of elements that were distributed into interstellar space. The concept that rapid nuclear fusion was the source of energy for a supernova explosion was developed by Hoyle and William Fowler during the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|BF4 forms a {{colourless}} centrosymmetric monoclinic crystal {{belonging to}} the P21/c space group, and with a density of 1.486gcm−3. Looking at the ORTEP diagram {{of the structure of}} the cation (at right), it is evident that it possesses the typical geometry expected of a rhodocene or rhodocenium cation. The two cyclopentadienyl rings are close to parallel (the centroid–Rh–centroid angle is 177.2°) and the rhodium centre is slightly closer to the substituted cyclopentadienyl ring (Rh–centroid distances are 1.819Å and 1.795Å), an observation attributed to the greater inductive effect of the tert-butyl groups on the substituted ligand. The ORTEP diagram shows that the cation adopts an eclipsed conformation in the solid state. The crystal structure of the hexafluorophosphate salt shows three crystallographically independent cations, one eclipsed, one staggered, and one which is <b>rotationally</b> disordered. This suggests that the conformation adopted is dependent on the anion present and also that the energy barrier to rotation is low – in ferrocene, the rotational energy barrier is known to be ~5kJmol−1 in both solution and gas phase.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} {{period of}} each star {{can be measured}} by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their spectral lines. The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using doppler broadening of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted. Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1±0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days. Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also tidally braked. Capella Aa has slowed until it is <b>rotationally</b> locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.|$|E

25|$|Three single-degree-of-freedom {{gyroscopes}} {{have their}} input axes aligned along an orthogonal inertial coordinate system. Three signal generators, {{fixed to the}} output axis of each gyro, generated electrical signals proportional to the torque disturbances. The signals were transmitted through the servo electronics which terminated in the gimbal pivot servotorque motors. The servoloops maintained the inner gimbal <b>rotationally</b> fixed in inertial space. That is, while the vehicle rolled, pitched, and yawed, the inner gimbal remained in the same attitude to which it was set just before launch. Though it was being translated during the launch and orbit process, it was <b>rotationally</b> fixed.|$|E
25|$|However, in the {{presence}} of couple-stresses, i.e. moments per unit volume, the stress tensor is non-symmetric. This also is the case when the Knudsen number is close to one, , or the continuum is a non-Newtonian fluid, which can lead to <b>rotationally</b> non-invariant fluids, such as polymers.|$|E
25|$|In particular, for {{a system}} which behaves the same {{regardless}} of how it is oriented in space, its Lagrangian is <b>rotationally</b> invariant. According to Noether's theorem, if the action (the integral over time of its Lagrangian) of a physical system is invariant under rotation, then angular momentum is conserved.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators {{is the same as}} the {{relationship between}} Lie algebras and Lie groups in mathematics. The close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in Noether's theorem that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are <b>rotationally</b> invariant.|$|E
25|$|In modern (20th century) {{theoretical}} physics, {{angular momentum}} (not including any intrinsic angular momentum – see below) is described {{using a different}} formalism, instead of a classical pseudovector. In this formalism, angular momentum is the 2-form Noether charge associated with rotational invariance. As a result, angular momentum is not conserved for general curved spacetimes, unless {{it happens to be}} asymptotically <b>rotationally</b> invariant.|$|E

The JT formed a bridge between 3,4-fold <b>rotationally</b> symmetric shapes, and the 5-fold family, such as a rhombic triacontahedron, which later he analyzed {{in terms of the}} T module, another tetrahedral wedge with the same volume as his A and B modules.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{irregularity}} of the Earth's true gravity field, {{the equilibrium}} figure of sea water, or the geoid, {{will also be}} of irregular form. In some places, like west of Ireland, the geoid—mathematical mean sea level—sticks {{out as much as}} 100 m above the regular, <b>rotationally</b> symmetric reference ellipsoid of GRS80; in other places, like close to Ceylon, it dives under the ellipsoid by nearly the same amount. The separation between these two surfaces is called the undulation of the geoid, symbol , and is closely related to the disturbing potential.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, Venn {{diagrams}} {{were further}} developed. D.W.Henderson showed in 1963 {{that the existence}} of an n-Venn diagram with n-fold rotational symmetry implied that n was a prime number. He also showed that such symmetric Venn diagrams exist when n is 5 or 7. In 2002 Peter Hamburger found symmetric Venn diagrams for n = 11 and in 2003, Griggs, Killian, and Savage showed that symmetric Venn diagrams exist for all other primes. Thus <b>rotationally</b> symmetric Venn diagrams exist if and only if n is a prime number.|$|E
25|$|Affine shape {{adaptation}} is {{a methodology}} for iteratively adapting {{the shape of}} the smoothing kernels in an affine group of smoothing kernels to the local image structure in neighbourhood region of a specific image point. Equivalently, affine shape adaptation can be accomplished by iteratively warping a local image patch with affine transformations while applying a <b>rotationally</b> symmetric filter to the warped image patches. Provided that this iterative process converges, the resulting fixed point will be affine invariant. In the area of computer vision, this idea has been used for defining affine invariant interest point operators as well as affine invariant texture analysis methods.|$|E

It is alternatively known in various European languages as the , gammadion cross, cross cramponnée, croix gammée, fylfot, or tetraskelion, and in Japan as the Manji. A swastika generally {{takes the form of}} a <b>rotationally</b> symmetrical arrangement (a cross) with four equally spaced legs of identical length each bent at 90 degrees in a uniform direction to create a pattern akin to a four-armed spiral. It is found in the archeological remains of the Indus Valley Civilization and Mesopotamia, as well as in early Byzantine and Christian artwork.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} kayaks for fishing are <b>rotationally</b> molded from {{polyethylene}} {{due to their}} durability and lower cost. Hard shell kayaks are preferred over inflatable kayaks, since they are not susceptible to lure punctures. Generally, kayak fishermen look for stable, durable and comfortable designs. The new generation of twinhull (catamaran) kayaks that was recently introduced into the market is stable enough to enable both paddling and fishing in the standing position. This technological development also solves some ergonomic problems {{that are associated with}} sitting for long hours without being able to change positions, and frees kayakers from the need to sacrifice speed to stability, which is another problem that characterizes monohull kayaks.|$|E
25|$|In general terms, {{gravitational}} waves are radiated by objects whose motion involves acceleration and its change, {{provided that the}} motion is not perfectly spherically symmetric (like an expanding or contracting sphere) or <b>rotationally</b> symmetric (like a spinning disk or sphere). A simple example of this principle is a spinning dumbbell. If the dumbbell spins around its axis of symmetry, it will not radiate {{gravitational waves}}; if it tumbles end over end, {{as in the case}} of two planets orbiting each other, it will radiate gravitational waves. The heavier the dumbbell, and the faster it tumbles, the greater is the gravitational radiation it will give off. In an extreme case, such as when the two weights of the dumbbell are massive stars like neutron stars or black holes, orbiting each other quickly, then significant amounts of gravitational radiation would be given off.|$|E
25|$|The candela (cd) is the SI unit of {{luminous}} intensity, that {{is power}} per unit solid angle {{in a given}} direction, weighted according to {{the sensitivity of the}} human eye to various colours of light. A typical candle produces light with about 1 candela of luminous intensity in all directions. A lamp can produce higher luminous intensity either by producing more light, or by focusing it tighter. The luminous intensity of a light depends on many factors, including the colour of the light and the eye's sensitivity to that colour, the optics involved, reflector and lens. Despite its complexity, it is a more useful measure than watts, because it defines how much usable light is shed in a given place: a dynamo headlight designed for road use and focused for seeing the road makes more efficient use {{of the power of the}} lamp than lights using <b>rotationally</b> symmetrical optics.|$|E
25|$|Lenticular galaxies share {{kinematic}} properties {{with both}} spiral and elliptical galaxies. This {{is due to}} the significant bulge and disk nature of lenticulars. The bulge component is similar to elliptical galaxies in that it is pressure supported by a central velocity dispersion. This situation is analogous to a balloon, where the motions of the air particles (stars in a bulge's case) are dominated by random motions. However, the kinematics of lenticular galaxies are dominated by the <b>rotationally</b> supported disk. Rotation support implies the average circular motion of stars in the disk is responsible for the stability of the galaxy. Thus kinematics are often used to distinguish lenticular galaxies from elliptical or spiral galaxies. The distinction between spiral galaxies and lenticular galaxies is often simpler to analyze as the dividing line is often set at a particular bulge-to-disk ratio. Determining the distinction between elliptical galaxies and lenticular galaxies often relies on the measurements of velocity dispersion (σ), rotational velocity (v), and ellipticity (ε). In order to differentiate between lenticulars and ellipticals, one typically looks at the v/σ ratio for a fixed ε. For example, a rough criterion for distinguishing between lenticular and elliptical galaxies is that elliptical galaxies have v/σ < 0.5 for ε = 0.3. The motivation behind this criterion is that lenticular galaxies do have prominent bulge and disk components whereas elliptical galaxies have no disk structure. Thus, lenticulars have much larger v/σ ratios than ellipticals due to their non-negligible rotational velocities (due to the disk component) in addition to not having as prominent of a bulge component compared to elliptical galaxies.|$|E
