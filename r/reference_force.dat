50|$|Force {{matching}} is {{a research}} method consisting of test subjects attempting to produce a force that is equal to a set <b>reference</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
50|$|A subject’s maximum {{voluntary}} contraction (MVC) is recorded {{and used to}} normalize both reference forces and results between subjects. During the test subjects are assisted in producing a <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> using various types of feedback (static weight or visual display of force generated). This is followed by an attempt of the subject to generate the <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> without assistance. The duration for both reference and matching tasks is usually four seconds. Results are taken as a mean value of force generated over a time interval set by the researcher. Time intervals are generally one second long and {{near the end of}} the attempt. Reference forces are typically set as a percentage of a subject’s MVC while error is typically reported as a percentage of a subject’s MVC.|$|E

In this study, a method to obtain the most appropriate <b>reference</b> cutting <b>force</b> for rough milling was developed. The <b>reference</b> cutting <b>force</b> was determined by considering the transverse rupture strength of the tool material and {{the area of the}} rupture surface. A finite element method analysis was performed to accurately calculate the area of the rupture surface. Using the analyzed results, the effect of various cutting parameters on the chipping phenomenon was determined. The calculation method for the <b>reference</b> cutting <b>force</b> considered the area of the rupture surface, the effect of the rake angle, and the axial depth of cut. The experimental results clearly show that the <b>reference</b> cutting <b>force</b> obtained from the proposed method met the desired constraints...|$|R

5000|$|Fine {{motor skills}} can be {{assessed}} with standardized and non-standardized tests in children and adults. Fine-motor assessments can include force matching tasks. Humans exhibit {{a high degree of}} accuracy in force matching tasks where an individual is instructed to match a <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> applied to a finger with the same or different finger. Humans also exhibit a high degree of accuracy during grip force matching tasks. These aspects of manual dexterity are apparent in the ability of humans to effectively use tools, and perform challenging manipulation tasks such as handling unstable objects. Other assessments include {{but are not limited to}} PDMS [...] "The Peabody Developmental Scales". PDMS is an evaluation done for children from birth till the age seven that examines the child's ability to grasp a variety of objects, the development of eye-hand coordination, and the child's overall finger dexterity.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that asymmetries in upper limb {{sensorimotor}} function are dependent on the source of sensory and motor information, hand preference and differences in hand strength. Further, the utilization of sensory and motor information and the mode of control of force may differ between the right hand/left hemisphere and left hand/right hemisphere systems. To more clearly understand the unique contribution of hand strength and intrinsic differences to the control of grasp force, we investigated hand/hemisphere differences when the source of force information was encoded at two different force levels corresponding to a 20 and 70 % maximum voluntary contraction or the right and left hand of each participant. Eleven, adult males who demonstrated a stronger right than left maximum grasp force were requested to match a right or left hand 20 or 70 % maximal voluntary contraction <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> with the opposite hand. During the matching task, visual feedback corresponding to the production of the <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> was available and then removed when the contralateral hand performed the match. The matching relative force error was significantly different between hands for the 70 % MVC <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> but not for the 20 % MVC <b>reference</b> <b>force.</b> Directional asymmetries, quantified as the matching force constant error, showed right hand overshoots and left undershoots were force dependent and primarily due to greater undershoots when matching with the left hand the right hand <b>reference</b> <b>force.</b> Findings further suggest that the interaction between internal sources of information, such as efferent copy and proprioception, as well as hand strength differences appear to be hand/hemisphere system dependent. Investigations of force matching tasks under conditions whereby force level is varied and visual feedback of the <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> is available provides critical baseline information for building effective interventions for asymmetric (stroke-related, Parkinson’s Disease) and symmetric (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) upper limb recovery of neurological conditions where the various sources of sensory – motor information have been significantly altered by the disease process...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{solution}} to a long standing problem: to define an inverse model-based feedforward action aimed at attaining an almost perfect transient tracking for PID controlled plants under constraints on the control effort and on the plant output. The new method situates in the recently proposed framework of pseudo inversion, which proved to be very effective to achieve an almost perfect tracking. The presented method assumes a B-spline function as the external <b>reference</b> <b>forcing</b> a given stable closed-loop system. The actual control input yielded by the external <b>reference</b> and <b>forcing</b> the plant is optimally approximated (in the least square sense) by a B-spline.

40|$|Optimal {{design of}} human-machine {{interfaces}} for teleoperators and virtual-environment systems which involve the tactual and kinesthetic modalities requires {{knowledge of the}} human's resolving power in these modalities. The resolution of the interface should be appropriately matched {{to that of the}} human operator. We report some preliminary results on the ability of the human hand to distinguish small differences in force under a variety of conditions. Experiments were conducted on force discrimination with the thumb pushing an interface that exerts a constant force over the pushing distance and the index finger pressing against a fixed support. The dependence of the sensitivity index d' on force increment can be fit by a straight line through the origin and the just-noticeable difference (JND) in force can thus be described by the inverse of the slope of this line. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was measured by varying the a priori probabilities of the two alternatives, <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> and <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> plus an increment, in one-interval, two-alternative, forced-choice experiments. When plotted on normal deviate coordinates, the ROC's were roughly straight lines of unit slope, thus supporting the assumption of equal-variance normal distributions {{and the use of the}} conventional d' measure. The JND was roughly 6 - 8 percent for <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> ranging from 2. 5 to 10 newtons, pushing distance from 5 to 30 mm, and initial finger-span from 45 to 125 mm. Also, the JND remained the same when the subjects were instructed to change the average speed of pushing from 23 to 153 mm/sec.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experimental studies}} conducted using a pneumatically driven haptic interface (PHI) system. The PHI is a unilateral exoskeletal device that tracks {{the motion of}} the shoulder and elbow. The study was carried out to evaluate the impact of an exoskeletal haptic interface on human perceptional capabilities. A population of twenty subjects participated in a set of experiments that were tailored to assess force sensation, shape perception, and effect of force feedback in task performance. Using Weber fractions, we contrasted the outcome of our force sensation experiments against results reported by psychophysical researchers. The results indicated that the perception of weight (or force magnitude) through the haptic interface was significantly affected for relatively low <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> levels (4. 44 N, Weber fraction 5 0. 5). The effect progressively diminished as the force level was increased, and almost matched the natural human capabilities for a <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> level of 18 N (Weber fraction 5 0. 06). The haptic shape identification experiments showed that the subjects were able to identify various shapes using the PHI system (1 5 0. 3 m reference length, with Weber fraction 5 0. 38). This identification, however, was adversely affected by the lack of tactile sensation in the haptic device. The outcome of the force-feedback experiments demonstrated mixed results, an observation that was consistent with experimental studies of other researchers. While force feedback did not affect the time needed to complete the task, the subjects' performance was significantly improved when the experiments involved controlling the thickness of a curve drawn on a pressure-sensitive tablet. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{available}} {{shoulder harness}} controlled prostheses do no fulfill {{the requirements of}} the users. It is unknown for which operating forces and cable displacements the user can make good use of proprioceptive feedback without feeling pain, discomfort or fatigue. These operating forces and cable displacements can be related to grasping forces and opening widths for activities of daily living to result in force and displacement transmission ratios for improved prosthetic design. The purpose of this research was to find operating force and cable displacement combinations that could be produced best without visual feedback. The force-displacement combinations were realized by a force task and interchangeable spring in the experimental setup. Thirty participants without arm defect wore a prosthesis simulator. They were first asked to produce a <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> with direct visual feedback of their operating force, next they were asked to reproduce this <b>reference</b> <b>force</b> without visual feedback. The error between visual produced value and blind reproduced value was used to evaluate the results. Best reproduced operating forces were found between 24 and 32 N. Best reproduced cable displacements were dependent on the spring that was used; the larger the cable displacement was, the better the result. For larger forces it was more difficult to repeat the reference force-displacement. A perfect prosthesis should be operated by forces between 24 N and 32 N. It is important to take the amputee and their individual abilities into account as the results differ largely between participants.
