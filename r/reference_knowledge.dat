40|$|Abstract. Over {{the last}} years, entity {{detection}} approaches which com-bine named entity recognition and entity linking {{have been used}} to detect mentions of RDF resources from a given <b>reference</b> <b>knowledge</b> base in un-structured data. In this paper, we address the problem of assigning a single URI to named entities which stand for the same real-object across documents but are not yet available in the <b>reference</b> <b>knowledge</b> base. This task is known as cross-document co-reference resolution and has been addressed by manifold approaches in the past. We present a pre-liminary study of a novel take on the task based on the use of latent fea-tures derived from matrix factorizations combined with parameter-free graph clustering. We study the influence of different parameters (window size, rank, hardening) on our approach by comparing the F-measures we achieve on the N 3 benchmark. Our results suggest that using latent fea-tures leads to higher F-measures with an increase of up to 20. 5 % on datasets of the N 3 collection. ...|$|E

KEGG provides a <b>reference</b> <b>knowledge</b> base for linking genomes to life {{through the process of}} PATHWAY mapping, which is to map, for example, a genomic or transcriptomic content of genes to KEGG reference pathways to infer systemic behaviors of the cell or the organism. In addition, KEGG provides a <b>reference</b> <b>knowledge</b> base for linking genomes to the environment, such as for the analysis of drug-target relationships, through the process of BRITE mapping. KEGG BRITE is an ontology database representing functional hierarchies of various biological objects, including molecules, cells, organisms, diseases and drugs, as well as relationships among them. KEGG PATHWAY is now supplemented with a new global map of metabolic pathways, which is essentially a combined map of about 120 existing pathway maps. In addition, smaller pathway modules are defined and stored in KEGG MODULE that also contains other functional units and complexes. The KEGG resource is being expanded to suit the needs for practical applications.

40|$|The Diagnostic Encyclopedia Workstation (DEW) is a {{computer}} system that provides completely integrated pictorial and textual information as <b>reference</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{in the field of}} ovarian pathology. Thse textual component comprises information per diagnosis such as descriptions of macroscopic and microscopic images, clinical signs, and prognosis. In addition, the system offers lists of differential diagnoses and criteria to differentiate among them. The present study evaluates to what extent the system influences the diagnostic process in efficiency and outcome. Therefore, two groups of six pathologists each, covering a wide spectrum of experience in ovarian pathology, participated in the evaluation of the DEW. The quality of the resulting diagnoses was statistically analyzed with the Wilcoxon rank sum test with re-spect to five different viewpoints: classification, morphology, clinical consequences, duration of diagnostic process, and consensus among the participants. The results are discussed and it is concluded lthat classification and morphology showed better results when books were used. The evaluation experiment was, however, very rigid and negatively biased with respect to the DEW systelm. Positive aspects of the encyclopedia are the easy access to diagnostic and differential diagnostic information and the large set of illustrations.

Switching decision {{is divided into}} two stages: the first stage is a switching decision study stage during network deployment and the second stage is a switching decision executing stage during network operation. The first stage comprises the following steps of: carrying out fuzzy treatment on accurate measurements of various switching indicators to form a fingerprint; and the set of fingerprints forms a decision <b>reference</b> <b>knowledge</b> base which is also called a fingerprint base. The second stage comprises the following steps of: carrying out fuzzy treatment on real-time input accurate measurements of various switching indicators; carrying out fuzzy logic matching computation with the fingerprints of the decision <b>reference</b> <b>knowledge</b> base; and switching the decision. The invention also discloses a system using the method. The method and the system disclosed by the invention can be used for transferring a part of treating expense after switching the decision from an operating stage to a network deployment stage, and therefore, the real-time treating expense of the operating stage is reduced and the operating speed and efficiency are enhanced. 本发明涉及一种基于模糊逻辑的指纹式智能切换判决方法，将切换判决分解成两个阶段：第一阶段是网络部署时的切换判决学习阶段，第二阶段是网络运行时的切换判决执行阶段；第一阶段包括如下步骤：对各类切换指示器的精确测量值进行模糊处理，形成一条“指纹”；“指纹”的集合构成判决参考知识库，也即“指纹库”；第二阶段包括如下步骤：对实时输入的所有类别切换指示器的精确测量值进行模糊化处理；与判决参考知识库的“指纹”进行模糊逻辑匹配计算；切换判决。本发明还公开了使用上述方法的系统。利用本发明公开的方法和系统，可以把切换判决的一部分处理开销从运行阶段转移到网络部署阶段，从而降低了运行阶段的实时处理开销，提高了运行速度和效率。Department of ComputingInventor name used in this publication: 姚刚Inventor name used in this publication: 曹建农Inventor name used in this publication: 张池生Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種基於模糊邏輯的指紋式智能切換判決方法及系統Chin...|$|E

40|$|A {{reference}} {{expert system}} may {{be considered to be}} a system with a knowledge base covering various aspects of the reference process in a library setting. Knowledge bases generally consist of several components (such as databases, rule bases, frames, and semantic nets) that interact with an inference engine, a user interface, and each other. This paper will examine progressively more complex knowledge-based systems for reference that can be constructed from components like these, concentrating at first on combinations of databases and rule bases. This examination will lead to a classification of reference expert systems. In Section 3, very simple architectures of a type common in other fields will first be considered. Arguments drawn from reference theory suggest that these simple architectures are appropriate primarily in dealing with directional reference transactions. In Sections 4 and 5, reference theory will be used to develop two additional architectures more appropriate to other reference transactions, such as ready-reference transactions. The classification of reference expert systems will be completed in Section 6 by examining further reference theory and then using it to develop variants on the three basic types. Section 7. 1 will discuss briefly the use of <b>reference</b> <b>knowledge</b> bases for computer-assisted instruction.
