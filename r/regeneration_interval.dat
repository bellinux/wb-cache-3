40|$|Abstract — BLDC Motors are {{permanent}} magnet Synchronous motors. The stator is having control windings and the rotor {{is having the}} {{permanent magnet}}s. So the construction is like a DC motor turned inside out. When the back EMF goes higher than the supply voltage, it can be functioned like an alternator as the load will feed the supply side. The motor can be controlled in all the four quadrant of a speed torque plane without any energy lose. Control is done by dSPIC. Four Quadrant operations come when the motor is allowed to rotate in both clockwise and counter-clockwise direction. Whenever there {{is a change in}} direction, back EMF goes higher than the supply side voltage, it is called the regeneration mode. The two motoring and two <b>regeneration</b> <b>interval</b> comprises the Four quadrant. This paper intends to save and reuse of regenerated electrical energy. The energy at the <b>regeneration</b> <b>interval</b> is stored in the supply side battery which can be used further instead of wasting as heat at the load Keywords—BLDC motor, Regenerative braking, Four quadran...|$|E
40|$|The {{gene bank}} at ICRISAT conserves about 15 ? 342 accessions of Arachis {{germplasm}} from 93 countries. The germplasm {{is stored in}} the form of pods under medium-term storage conditions (4 °C and 30 % relative humidity). Because pod storage requires more space (× 3) the relative costs of pod and seed storage were compared for the cultivars JL 24 and ICGS 76. Following estimates the cost saving per accession is US$ 0. 59 or about US$ 9050 annually for the entire collection if the switch is made to seed storage. However, the slightly longer survival due to pod storage results in less frequent regeneration. The cost of regenerating one accession is estimated at US$ 13. 06 for pod storage, increasing to US$ 13. 26 for seed storage due to the extra labour cost incurred for shelling. Assuming an 11 year <b>regeneration</b> <b>interval</b> under both storage methods, the cost of storing and regenerating an accession in perpetuity would be US$ 62. 49 for pod storage and US$ 47. 72 for seed storage when the real rate of interest is 4 %...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} scheduling trains and containers (or trucks and pallets) between a depot and a destination. Goods arrive at the depot dynamically over time and have distinct due dates at the destination. There is a fixed-charge transportation cost for each vehicle, and each vehicle has the same capacity. The cost of holding goods may differ between the depot and the destination. The goal is to minimize the sum of transportation and holding costs. For the case in which all goods have the same holding costs, we consider two variations: {{one in which the}} holding cost at the destination is less than that at the origin, and one in which the relationship is reversed. For the first variation, we derive properties of the optimal solution which provide the basis for an OT 2 solution procedure. For the second variation, we introduce a new definition of a regeneration state, derive strong characterizations of the shipment schedule within a <b>regeneration</b> <b>interval,</b> and develop an OT 4 procedure. We also analyze two multi-item scenarios. In the first, for each item, the holding cost at the origin is less than that at the destination; in the second, the relationship is reversed for all items. We generalize several of the structural results for the single-item problem to the corresponding multi-item case. We also show that the optimal vehicle schedule can be obtained by solving a related single-item problem in which the item demands are aggregated in a particular way. The optimal assignment of customer orders to vehicles can then be found by solving a linear program...|$|E
40|$|Diesel {{particulate}} {{filters are}} gradually {{making their way}} into production to keep emissions of fine dust to a minimum. But which filters are most efficient at extracting the noxious particles? How do the geometrical details of the filter material affect the filter properties? The new simulation software FilterDict could in the future significantly {{reduce the number of}} prototypes required, cutting time and cost of development - and offer some powerful new features, as well. It allows simulation of how fast and how far particles penetrate into the filter, for example - using any kind of filter material. As input parameters, FilterDict requires a filter material model from the 3 -D microstructure generator GeoDict, various physical parameters, and the particle size distribution. The software computes the path of the soot particles through the filter medium. The simulation shows how much soot is deposited in which part of the filter. Therefore, the design of the filter can b e optimized to achieve long <b>regeneration</b> <b>intervals,</b> low fuel consumption and a high engine rating. The simulation program has already passed its first practical test. In an experiment, researchers examined two diesel particulate filters, and compared the results with those of the simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is using a series of field investigations to determine the status and potential of natural regeneration of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) on the area of interest "The Forests of The City of Brno, Corp. ". Based {{on the results of}} field investigations we can deduce on fertility of Douglas fir, status and parameters of natural <b>regeneration,</b> <b>intervals</b> of seed years and dispersal possibilities of natural regeneration from the parent growth. The work consists of two different parts, theoretical and methodological (practical). The first part analyses theoretical aspects of the solved issue and the second part is devoted mainly to the methodological procedures. Of the 100 analyzed growths was located 86 % on nutrient habitats. In 77 % of cases occurred in the growths Douglas fir as wood disseminated. All growths over 80 years are spawning: 33 % slightly, 58 % moderate and 9 % richly. Without natural regeneration was recorded only 17 % of growths. The height of Douglas fir grow under vegetation of 1, 3 meters can be expected in the age of 11 [...] 12 years...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} set {{out with the}} {{objective}} of analyzing successional process in areas which are deforested and dominated by Pteridium aquilinum in the Serra da Mantiqueira mountain range, by researching the natural regeneration of shrub and tree species and evaluating both disturbance history and the edaphic conditions on the natural regeneration community. This research investigated two abandoned pasture areas in Bocaina de Minas county exposed to natural <b>regeneration</b> <b>intervals</b> ranging from six years (area named 6 A) to twenty years (area named 20 A). The inventory occurred from sixty plots of 10 m², where all samples surveyed were between 0. 15 m and 3 m high. All samples were identified and both the diameter in ground level and total height of the specimens were measured. The survey totaled 1, 159 samples and 53 species. Melastomataceae was registered with the highest species richness and the highest specimen abundance. The two sampled areas showed species composition differences, with Jaccard similarity coefficient equal to 3. 7 %. The canonical correspondence analysis showed the correlations between natural regeneration stratum and non-labile phosphorus and clay in the 6 A area. On the other hand, the 20 A area showed correlations between plant regeneration and the K, P, Ca²+, Al³+ levels, with higher pH levels, and with the sum of exchangeable bases. In addition, the vegetation surveyed in area 20 A was correlated with higher Pteridium population density. The results showed that the dominance of Pteridium aquilinum leads to successional process under inhibition, in which the ferns act negatively on the richness and abundance of shrub populations. It was also confirmed the Pteridium's affinity to steep areas, mainly in higher altitudes, where the soil is acid, as well as its preference to disturbed areas. Moreover, we highlight the fragilities of the mountain environments and the importance of preserving natural vegetation, as well as the bracken management as a strategy for forest restoration...|$|R
40|$|Seven natural phenols and two {{synthetic}} compounds {{were evaluated}} by means of cyclic voltammetry as enhancers for the oxidation of the lignin model compound veratryl alcohol (VAl) and a sulfonated lignin (SL). Their electrochemical behaviors and catalytic efficiencies (CEs) against both substrates were assessed {{as a function of}} pH. A general increase in CE of the phenols was for the first time observed in the oxidation of VAl at pH 7 and 8. Methyl syringate (MS), syringic acid (SRC), and syringaldehyde (SRD) exhibited the highest CEs against VAl among the studied phenolic compounds despite the reduced stabilities of their phenoxy radicals. This was a result of favorable stability−reactivity balances, which were apparently influenced by both the chemical structures of the enhancers and the experimental conditions. Violuric acid (VAc) proved the most efficient compound in oxidizing lignin, followed by SRD and MS, which showed <b>regeneration</b> in the <b>interval</b> of pHs studiedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|When {{exposed to}} {{constant}} low temperatures (CLTs), insects often suffer from cumulative physiological injuries that can severely compromise their fitness and survival. Yet, mortality can be considerably lowered when the cold stress period {{is interrupted by}} periodic warm interruption(s), referred to as fluctuating thermal regimes, FTRs. In this study, we have shown that FTRs strongly promoted cold tolerance of Drosophila melanogaster adults. We then assessed whether this marked phenotypic shift was associated with detectable physiological changes, such as synthesis of cryoprotectants and/or membrane remodeling. To test these hypotheses, we conducted two different time-series Omics analyzes in adult flies submitted to CLTs vs. FTRs: metabolomics (GC/MS) and lipidomics (LC/ESI/MS) targeting membrane phospholipids. We observed increasing levels in several polyhydric alcohols (arabitol, erythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol), sugars (fructose, mannose) and amino acids (serine, alanine, glutamine) in flies under CLT. Prolonged exposure to low temperature was also associated with a marked deviation of metabolic homeostasis and warm interruptions as short as 2 h were sufficient to periodically return the metabolic system to functionality. Lipidomics revealed an increased relative proportion of phosphatidylethanolamines and a shortening of fatty acyl chains in flies exposed to cold, likely {{to compensate for the}} ordering effect of low temperature on membranes. We found a remarkable correspondence in the time-course of changes between the metabolic and phospholipids networks, both suggesting a fast homeostatic <b>regeneration</b> during warm <b>intervals</b> under FTRs. In consequence, we suggest that periodic opportunities to restore system-wide homeostasis contribute to promote cold tolerance under FTRs...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cytokine {{administration}} {{is a potential}} therapy for acute liver failure by reducing inflammatory responses and favour hepatocyte regeneration. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the role of interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 ra) during liver regeneration and to study the effect of a recombinant human IL- 1 ra on liver regeneration. Methods: We performed 70 %-hepatectomy in wild type (WT) mice, IL- 1 ra knock-out (KO) mice and in WT mice treated by anakinra. We analyzed liver <b>regeneration</b> at regular <b>intervals</b> by measuring the blood levels of cytokines, the hepatocyte proliferation by bromodeoxyuridin (BrdU) incorporation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Cyclin D 1 expression. The effect of anakinra on hepatocyte proliferation was also tested in vitro using human hepatocytes. Results: At 24 h and at 48 h after hepatectomy, IL- 1 ra KO mice had significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 1 b and MCP- 1) and a reduced and delayed hepatocyte proliferation measured by BrdU incorporation, PCNA and Cyclin D 1 protein levels, when compared to WT mice. IGFBP- 1 and C/EBPb expression was significantly decreased in IL- 1 ra KO compared to WT mice. WT mice treated with anakinra showed significantly decreased levels of IL- 6 and significantly higher hepatocyte proliferation at 24 h compared to untreated WT mice. In vitro, primary human hepatocytes treated with anakinra showed significantly higher proliferation at 24 h compared to hepatocytes without treatment. Conclusion: IL 1 ra modulates the early phase of liver regeneration by decreasing the inflammatory stress and acceleratin...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{removing}} or trimming the chelipeds at various molt stages on <b>regeneration,</b> molt <b>interval</b> (MI) and specific growth rate (SGR) were determined in mud crab Scylla serrata. These strategies {{in combination with}} provision of shelters and food were tested in relation to survival and growth. Hatchery-reared S. serrata juveniles (1. 3 â€“ 2. 2 g body weight) in the postmolt, intermolt, and premolt stages were subjected to autotomy of two chelipeds, and trimming of dactylus and pollex. Intact crabs served as the control group. Interval from stocking to first molt was significantly longer in crabs autotomized at intermolt or premolt than in trimmed or intact crabs, but was similar to intact crabs when autotomy was done at postmolt. However, MI from first to second molts was longer compared to intact crabs when chelipeds were removed or trimmed at premolt. After the first molt, autotomy and not trimming caused significant decrease in SGR. The SGRs {{at the end of}} the test were similar to intact crabs (postmolt: 7. 90 Â± 0. 39, intermolt: 5. 64 Â± 0. 50) when trimming of chelipeds was done at postmolt (8. 01 Â± 0. 75) or intermolt (4. 38 Â± 0. 40). However, SGR was lower when premolt crabs were subjected to autotomy (4. 11 Â± 0. 67) and trimming (5. 29 Â± 1. 40) than when chelipeds were intact (9. 45 Â± 0. 47). A two-factor experiment was conducted in the second phase where intermolt crabs with autotomized or trimmed chelipeds (factor A) were either fed or starved but provided with shelters or fed but without shelters (factor B). After 10 days, higher survival was obtained in crabs with autotomized (95. 55 Â± 2. 94 %) or trimmed chelipeds (93. 33 Â± 3. 33 %) than in intact crabs (73. 33 Â± 6. 67 %). Survival was not affected by factor B, but higher final mean body weights were attained in fed crabs with (0. 78 Â± 0. 04 g) or without shelters (0. 74 Â± 0. 04 g) than unfed ones (0. 48 Â± 0. 04 g). A third experiment was conducted to verify these results. Crabs with trimmed or intact chelipeds were either fed or unfed. No shelters were provided. Crabs with trimmed chelipeds (88. 57 Â± 0 %) had higher survival than intact crabs (59. 76 Â± 7. 56 %) regardless of whether they were fed or starved; and fed crabs (0. 82 Â± 0. 04 g) had higher mean body weight than unfed crabs (0. 61 Â± 0. 07 g) regardless of whether chelipeds were intact or trimmed. These results indicate that trimming or total removal of chelipeds are effective strategies in reducing cannibalism.

40|$|Fires {{regularly}} affect many of {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s terrestrial ecosystems, and, as a result, fires mediate the exchange of greenhouse gases (GHG) between the land and the atmosphere at a global scale and affect the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to store carbon (Bowman et al. 2009). Variations in fire -regimes can therefore potentially affect the global, regional and local carbon balance and, potentially, climate change itself (Bonan 2008). Here we examine how variation in fire regimes (Gill 1975; Bradstock et al. 2002) will potentially affect carbon in fire-prone Australian ecosystems via interactions with the stocks and transfers of carbon that are inherent to all terrestrial ecosystems. There are two key reasons why an appreciation of fire regimes is needed to comprehend the fate of terrestrial carbon. First, the status of terrestrial carbon over time will be a function of the balance between losses (emissions) from individual fires (of differing type, season and intensity), which occur as a result of immediate combustion as well as mortality and longerterm decomposition of dead biomass, and carbon that accumulates during <b>regeneration</b> in the <b>intervals</b> between fires. The length of the interval between fires will determine the amount of biomass that accumulates. Second, fire regimes influence the composition and structure of ecosystems and key processes such as plant mortality and recruitment. Hence, alternative trajectories of vegetation composition and structure that result from differing fire regimes will affect carbon dynamics. We explore these themes and summarise the dynamic aspects of carbon stocks and transfers in relation to fire, present conceptual models of carbon dynamics and fire regimes, and review how variation in fire regimes may affect overall storage potential as a function of fireinduced losses and post-fire uptake in two widespread Australian vegetation types. We then appraise future trends under global change and the likely potential for managing fire regimes for carbon 2 ̆ 7 benefits 2 ̆ 7, especially with respect to emissions...|$|R
40|$|When mature beech {{forests are}} harvested, the new {{regeneration}} is established by natural regeneration, which is {{by using the}} seeds from the old stand to create the new generation. Most often the seed from a single mast year is used preceded by site preparation. After seed-fall, a heavy thinning in the old stand is performed, leaving a protective shelter. Sometimes an alternative, less intense regeneration method is used, which {{involves the use of}} seed from several mast years and no site preparation. These methods usually result in adequate regenerations but sometimes failures occur in old stands with a low site index, a thick humus layer, and acid soils. The occurrence of mast years {{and the size of the}} seed production in them are important factors when working with natural <b>regeneration.</b> The mean <b>interval</b> between mast years has been about five years since the end of the 17 th century, but during the last 30 years this has decreased to 2. 5 years. Seed production increased with increasing site index and mast years were usually preceded by a warm and dry July in the previous year. An alternative, more extensive regeneration method is currently sometimes used in southern Sweden. The method has both economic and ecological advantages. Seed from several mast years are used and instead of site preparation, several judicious cuttings are made in the old stand in order to regulate the conditions of the forest floor in a way that promotes the establishment and growth of the new seedlings. The regeneration dynamics have been studied and documented and the method has resulted in good regenerations, independent of site index. However, regeneration failures sometimes occur at old sites with low fertility and a low pH. In Europe, liming is an option to overcome these difficulties. To study the effect of liming, 12 sites in southern Sweden were limed in 1991 and 1993, and in 2007 three of these were regenerated using the traditional method, and three were regenerated with the alternative method. Neither the sizes of the seed-falls nor the height growth of new seedlings were influenced by liming. When the traditional method was used, liming improved the regeneration result in a stand of low site index, while the opposite effect was found in a stand of high site index. Seedling survival, the size of earthworm populations, and the concentrations of a potential defensive compound in seedling leaves, chlorogenic acid, all increased after liming. In the alternative regeneration method, the numbers of germinates developing in years following mast years was negatively affected by liming in the first six years after liming. Thereafter the effect was positive. Liming shortens the regeneration period and increases the number of seedlings...|$|R
