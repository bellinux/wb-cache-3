40|$|Parity amongst teams {{is often}} {{thought to be}} the ideal towards which a sports {{association}} should strive. Most leagues implement salary caps, <b>reverse</b> order <b>drafts,</b> and/or revenue sharing to promote competitive balance. However, in the 1999 collective bargaining agreement, the NBA adopted a max contract that limits the amount that an individual player can be paid. Theoretically this works against parity as high-end players can be obtained below market value, which in turn provides surplus wins to the teams that are able to acquire these players. Here we will show empirically that the max contract does in fact negatively affect competitive balance in the 2015 - 2016 NBA microeconomy, though the benefits only significantly impact a small handful of teams...|$|R

50|$|While his NHL {{rights were}} {{held by the}} Boston Bruins, Heindl never played for the parent club, and in 1970 was claimed by the Minnesota North Stars from Boston in the NHL <b>reverse</b> <b>draft.</b> Over the next two seasons, Heindl spent more time playing for Minnesota's American Hockey League {{affiliate}} the Cleveland Barons than in the NHL, and was left unprotected for the 1972 NHL Expansion Draft, where he was claimed by the incoming Atlanta Flames. Atlanta quickly traded him to the New York Rangers for Bill Hogaboam, and he played four games for New York, which {{was the end of}} his NHL career. The following season Heindl joined the World Hockey Association's Cleveland Crusaders, who had acquired his WHA rights from the Winnipeg Jets. After two seasons playing in Sweden with BK Backen, Heindl retired from professional hockey in 1977. He turned to coaching, serving for a time as the bench boss of the Steinbach Huskies who reached the 1979 Allan Cup final, but lost the Canadian senior championship to the Petrolia Squires.|$|E

50|$|When in 1918 the US {{government}} <b>reversed</b> its <b>draft</b> {{exemption for}} married workers and required all men {{to work in}} essential occupations or serve in the military, professional baseball players either enlisted or joined industrial baseball leagues. Company leagues included those of Bethlehem Steel, which had recreational leagues on both coasts that by 1918 represented a major-league level of competition. Sparrows Point, Maryland, a Bethlehem Steel company town, had a Steel League team, whose results Baltimore baseball fans followed closely. At the same time, fans also followed the draft status and 1918 season of Baltimore native Babe Ruth, then playing with the Boston Red Sox and considering his own options, including joining an industrial league team. In September Bethlehem Steel, fearing competition with other leagues over professional talent, disbanded the Steel League. When the war ended in November, players such as Ruth were free to re-sign with their major league teams.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{everything}} was <b>reversed.</b> The <b>draft</b> charter of liberties was marked as cancelled because of archbishop's death. John {{had changed his}} mind completely and on 5 August 1205, only {{three weeks after the}} archbishop's death, he appointed a replacement dean of Wolverhampton: Henry, the son of his Chief Justiciar, Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex. Abandoning any pretence of reform, the terms of Henry's appointment specified that he was to hold the deanery with its liberties and honours exactly as his predecessors. Well-connected to all the centres of power in the kingdom, he seems to have held the post of dean for nearly two decades. It is often claimed that the new church was begun early in the 13th century, probably during the interregnum, meaning {{that it would have been}} constructed largely under Henry. However, the building's Historic England listing now suggests that the earliest part of the present building, the crossing and south transept, date from the late 13th century.|$|R

For it to work effectively, teams {{must be able to}} identify the “best” talent. Our study of NFL quarterbacks highlights problems with the draft process. We find only a weak correlation between teams’ evaluations on draft day and subsequent quarterback performance in the NFL. Moreover, many of the factors that enhance a quarterback’s draft position are unrelated to future NFL performance.

50|$|Upon {{the release}} of the 2016 draft electoral redistribution, Liberal MP Rachel Sanderson {{organised}} the mass distribution of a pro forma document in the two inner metropolitan suburbs of Walkerville and Gilberton, which aimed for residents to use the pro forma document to submit their objection to the commission in support of Sanderson's campaign to keep the two suburbs in her seat of Adelaide, which in the draft would have been transferred to neighbouring Torrens. Sanderson's position however was at odds with her own party's submission which in fact agreed with the commission that Walkerville should be transferred to Torrens. Under the commission's draft proposal, the Liberal margin in Adelaide would have been reduced from 2.4 percent to 0.6 percent, but would have also resulted in the Labor margin in Torrens reduced from 3.5 percent to 1.1 percent. Of a record 130 total submissions received in response to the draft redistribution, about 100 (over three quarters of all submissions) were from Walkerville and Gilberton. As a result, the commission <b>reversed</b> the <b>draft</b> decision in the final publication.|$|R
40|$|Objectives The {{objective}} of the thesis is to study {{the formation of the}} competitive balance in the National Hockey League. Unlike many studies related to the topic, I found it interesting to consider both the athletical and financial side of competitive balance. When it comes to the financial side, it is necessary to focus on the revenue sharing program along with franchise valuations. On the other hand, the objective is to show that there are major drawbacks when the competitive balance is solely related to the financial side of the business. When we also consider the athletical side of the business, it is possible to get a more comprehensive understanding of the formation of competitive balance in the National Hockey League. Findings Using empirical data from the NHL website along with relevant studies, I was able to create comparison between the financial competitive balance and the athletical competitive balance. The league utilized a revenue sharing program to address the financial inequalities, but it seems rather inefficient considering the significant differences in the franchise valuations. There are also major differences in the market size and fan base between franchises, which do not create equal possibilities for financial success. On the other hand, the athletical success of each franchise is efficiently taken into consideration. Systems such as the <b>reverse</b> order <b>draft</b> allow franchises to gradually strengthen their competitive balance regardless of their financial situation...|$|R
