5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1969, the Australian Econ Fodder Roller baler came out, a design that made a 135 kg (300 lb) ground-rolled bale. In September of that same year The Hawkbilt Company of Vinton, Iowa, {{contacted}} Dr. Buchele about his design, then fabricated a large ground-rolling <b>round</b> <b>baler</b> which baled hay that had been {{laid out in a}} windrow, and began manufacturing large round balers in 1970. In 1972, Gary Vermeer of Pella, Iowa, designed and fabricated a <b>round</b> <b>baler</b> after the design of the A-C Roto-Baler, and the Vermeer Company began selling its model 605 - the first modern <b>round</b> <b>baler.</b> The Vermeer design used belts to compact hay into a cylindrical shape as is seen today. [...] In the early 1980s, collaboration between Walterscheid and Vermeer produced the first effective uses of CV joints in balers, and later in other farm machinery. Due to the heavy torque required for such equipment, double Cardan joints are primarily used. Former Walterscheid engineer Martin Brown is credited with [...] "inventing" [...] this use for universal joints.|$|E
50|$|In 1956, Vermeer Manufacturing Company {{became one}} of two {{organizations}} to introduce the hay conditioner to the agricultural market. By 1960, nearly 5,000 units had been sold to the farm industry. A major breakthrough in the agriculture industry was {{the development of the}} <b>round</b> <b>baler.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{conceived}} by Ummo Luebben circa 1910, the first <b>round</b> <b>baler</b> {{did not see}} production until 1947 when Allis-Chalmers introduced the Roto-Baler. Marketed for the water-shedding and light weight properties of its hay bales, AC had sold nearly 70,000 units {{by the end of}} production in 1960. [...] The next major innovation began in 1965 when a graduate student at Iowa State University, Virgil Haverdink, sought out Wesley F. Buchele, a professor of Agricultural Engineering, seeking a research topic for a master thesis. Over the next year Buchele and Haverdink developed a new design for a large <b>round</b> <b>baler,</b> completed and tested in 1966, and thereafter dubbed the Buchele-Haverdink large <b>round</b> <b>baler.</b> [...] The large round bales were about 1.5 meters (5 ft) in diameter, 2 meters (7 ft) long, and they weighed about 270 kilograms (600 lbs) after they dried—about 80 kg/m3 (5 lb/ft3). The design was promoted as a [...] "Whale of a Bale" [...] and Iowa State University now explains the innovative design as follows: [...] "Farmers were saved from the backbreaking chore of slinging hay bales in the 1960s when Iowa State agricultural engineering professor Wesley Buchele and a group of student researchers invented a baler that produced large, round bales that could be moved by tractor. The baler has become the predominant forage-handling machine in the United States." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} type of baler in industrialized {{countries}} today is the <b>round</b> <b>baler.</b> It produces cylinder-shaped [...] "round" [...] or [...] "rolled" [...] bales. The design has a [...] "thatched roof" [...] effect that withstands weather well. Grass is rolled up inside the baler using rubberized belts, fixed rollers, or a combination of the two. When the bale reaches a predetermined size, either netting or twine is wrapped around it to hold its shape. The back of the baler swings open, and the bale is discharged. The bales are complete at this stage, but they may also be wrapped in plastic sheeting by a bale wrapper, either to keep hay dry when stored outside or convert damp grass into silage. Variable-chamber large round balers typically produce bales from 48 to 72 in in diameter and up to 60 in in width. The bales can weigh anywhere from 1100 to 2200 lb, depending upon size, material, and moisture content. Common modern small round balers (also called [...] "mini round balers" [...] or [...] "roto-balers") produce bales 20 to 22 in in diameter and 20.5 to 28 in in width, generally weighing from 40 to 55 lb.|$|E

30|$|The {{benefit of}} ConSerts (or SM@RT in general) {{in this setting}} is pretty clear. Assume there is a farmer who owns a TIM-capable tractor and a TIM-capable <b>round</b> <b>baler.</b> The TIM baling {{application}} is running on the implement, and the user interface is displayed on a virtual terminal in the cabin. In addition to a standard configuration, the baling application also supports an extended configuration, which additionally incorporates a swath scanner device. This device is mounted {{on the front of}} the tractor and measures the volumetric flow and the location of the swath to further optimize the baling operation in terms of tractor speed and steering angle. The baling application can then be enabled when tractor, implement, virtual terminal, and swath scanner are connected and the automated ConSert-based interoperability and safety checks have been successful. Corresponding information is provided to the operator via the terminal. Parameterization and constraints are set appropriately. The actual round baling process can then be activated by the operator, who thus relinquishes control to the <b>round</b> <b>baler.</b> The <b>round</b> <b>baler</b> commands the tractor to drive over the swath with optimal acceleration rates and speed. When the bale reaches a preset size, the tractor decelerates to a standstill and the bale is ejected. The process can then be re-started by the operator.|$|E

40|$|Three {{systems for}} {{recovering}} kiwifruit pruning residues were compared for their cost-effectiveness. The systems were a shredder {{with a built-in}} dumping container; a shredder with drop-down re-usable bins, of the type normally used for fruit collection, working with a dedicated bin-collection system; and a <b>round</b> <b>baler</b> equipped with an add-on bale storage unit. All systems were light enough to be towed or carried behind a compact vineyard tractor. Harvesting and processing productivity, including all delays, ranged from 1. 8 to 3. 7 tonnes per scheduled machine hour (SMH). After standardization, calculated recovery cost varied between 8. 4 and 28. 6 Euros t- 1 for the residue delivered at the field edge. The shredder with a built-in dumping container emerged as the best performer, favored because of a faster pick-up and a more efficient single-pass work mode. Overall, this system is simpler, more productive, and offers the lowest processing cost. The annual utilization of all the dedicated recovery implements tested should at least be 50 ha year- 1 (approx. 500 t year- 1) {{in order to obtain}} acceptable cost results. Kiwifruit orchards offer a very high residue yield, about four times higher than vineyards and olive tree groves.

30|$|ConSerts {{need to be}} {{transferred}} into a machine-readable form to enable dynamic evaluation, and there need to be corresponding mechanisms built into the systems that operate on this information (i.e., ConSerts as SM@RT) to conduct the evaluation. Of course, the evaluation protocols need to be standardized to ensure that every participating system is interoperable from a ConSert point of view. Assume that the operator has installed the swath scanner on the tractor and that tractor and <b>round</b> <b>baler</b> are coupled. The operator initiates TIM via the virtual terminal and explicitly selects the application variant that provides flexible control of speed and steering based on the input from the swath scanner. The first step is now to start the application, i.e., to dynamically integrate the participating systems. After this has succeeded, {{the evaluation of the}} safety guarantees of the application is started. Note that the application forms the root of a dynamically formed composition hierarchy (in contrast to basic services or functions, which are rendered by lower-level components/systems and which are consumed by superordinate components/systems) and the correlated ConSert has the scope of this whole system-of-systems application. The evaluation of ConSerts starts from the leaf systems that have no external service-related dependencies. These systems determine their RtEs and propagate them up in the composition hierarchy. Eventually, all service-related demands of the root (i.e., the TIM baling application) can be checked and, together with the evaluation results of the RtEs, the top-level safety guarantees are determined.|$|E

40|$|An {{overview}} of different methods developed and tested for material feed rate measurement during {{the work of}} harvesting machines is done. Many systems are known and just commercially used for grain flow measurement during the grain harvest by combine harvesters. The errors and their sources during the work of these systems described by many authors are discussed. The yield measurement methods are under developing for other harvesting machines, e. g. forage harvesters, mowing machines, potato, sugar beet, cotton and tomato harvesters etc. The function principles of systems based on weighing trailers or <b>round</b> <b>balers</b> are described as well. Two methods of the mowing machine material feed rate measurement were developed and tested. The measurements carried out proved that a very good linear relationship existed between the conditioner's power input, output frequency of the apparatus measuring impact force {{by means of the}} impact plate, and material feed rate through the mowing machine. The calculated R-Squared values were about 0, 95. The impact of materials and conditions changes on mowing machine material feed rate measurement accuracy was measured under laboratory conditions as well. It was evident from statistical evaluation that changing crop variety, crop maturity and intensity of conditioning can have statistically significant influence on the measurement based on torque-meter.

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of GeographyLisa M. HarringtonHayscapes, or haying landscapes, are {{distinctive}} cultural landscapes that evolve {{through time}} {{as a result of}} technological changes in response to economic realities. Since settlement began in the western United States, hay-making has gone through a number of mechanical revolutions that have given rise to an assortment of different methods employed in the process of gathering and storing hay. For this research, the changes in haying technology and resulting cultural landscapes are divided into four eras based on the haying methods of the time in western Montana and eastern Idaho. Common haying technology used in the study area {{at one time or another}} includes rudimentary devices, hay derricks, Beaverslides, overshots, swinging arm stackers, small, rectangular balers, tractors with front loader extensions, loaf stackers, <b>round</b> <b>balers,</b> large, rectangular balers, and forage harvesters (choppers). Farmers and ranchers create different hayscapes based on the technology used. There are different reasons for using different haying technologies, such as the type and size of agricultural operation, economics, and personal preference. Landscapes are documents, and by “reading” the haying landscape, we are able to acknowledge the story of the transition of life and ways of the past to present-day living of the people. Insights are discovered regarding past and present technologies and aspects of their social and economic systems.

40|$|This study {{examines}} harvesting systems and presents conclusions on selection of machines for harvesting silage for dairy cows. Achieving {{a high quality}} cut of forage requires a high machine capacity and harvesting {{must be carried out}} at the optimal time with respect to plant growth stage. Therefore calculation of timeliness costs, which are determined by the time and capacity of harvesting, formed {{an important part of the}} study. These calculations require timeliness factors that describe the losses for each day by which harvest is delayed after the date of maximum economic crop value. The timeliness factors were calculated for each cut from data on changes in yield and quality of cuts during the harvest period. Harvesting cost calculations were based on a precision chop forage trailer, a precision chop forage harvester with separate transport trailers and a <b>round</b> <b>baler</b> with integral wrapping. Cost calculations were carried out for three different sizes of machine chain (small (S), medium (M) and large (L)) for each harvest system. The operations included were mowingconditioning, harvesting in the field, transport to storage and loading and packing into a bunker silo. Harvesting costs included the cost of machines, labour and timeliness. In addition, ensiling costs such as bale plastic and the investment, interest and maintenance cost for the bunker silo or the storage area for round bales were included when comparing the harvesting systems. Calculations were made for a three-cut system in conventional (CONV) and organic (ORG) forage production in southern Sweden (Gss) and central Sweden (Ss). When timeliness costs were not considered there was a risk of too low a harvest capacity being chosen. The effect of including timeliness costs when calculating harvesting costs increased with the forage area harvested, since a larger forage area increased the duration of harvest. Table S 1 shows harvesting and ensiling costs with 1 km transport distance for 70 hectares of forage in conventional production and 90 hectares in organic production in central Sweden. At short transport distances (1 km), the precision chop forage trailer and the precision chop forage harvester with separate transport trailers had similar harvesting and ensiling costs, while those for round baling were somewhat higher. The precision chop forage harvester with 2 or 3 transport trailers resulted in the lowest costs at 2 - 7 km transport distance. At longer transport distances (> 7 km), the <b>round</b> <b>baler</b> was the cheapest of the harvesting systems studied here. As regards machine capacity, it is clear from Figure S 1 that to minimise harvesting costs the smallest machine chain should be used for forage areas less than 60 ha, whereas when the forage area exceeds 90 ha the largest machine chain should be chosen. In the 60 - 90 ha forage area range, there was little difference in costs between the S, M and L machine chains. For harvest with round bales only the size of the mower-conditioner varied between the machine chains and the largest machine chain had the lowest harvest costs for all forage areas. Machine cooperatives are a good way to lower harvesting costs since for smaller forage areas in particular, increased annual use of the machines decreases the machine costs and allows larger machines to be used to greater capacity. To avoid high timeliness costs it is important that cuts are performed at the optimal time...|$|E
30|$|As a {{very simple}} example, assume a farmer {{connecting}} a <b>round</b> <b>baler</b> of manufacturer A to a tractor of manufacturer B. The manufacturers developed their products completely independent from each other. However, using a common communication standard, the baler can control the tractor (acceleration, steering, etc.). The manufacturers have assured their product’s safety independent from each other, {{but there has been}} no hazard analysis and integrated safety assurance of the resulting system of systems. Today this issue is tackled by means of 1 -to- 1 consideration of concrete pairs of tractors and implements. However, considering the number of possible combinations of tractors and implements, it is impossible (or at least economically infeasible) to consider and certify each conceivable combination manually. Considering further that typical open systems of systems consist of a lot more than only two constituent systems, assuring the safety of open systems of systems becomes a very challenging task. To remediate this issue, it seems not sufficient to think in the direction of only slight improvements of established methods and techniques. Instead, we argue that it makes sense to explore completely new types of solutions that enable systems to assume certain aspects of safety assurance themselves and during runtime. John Rushby {{was one of the first}} researchers publishing about this idea [1]. We subsequently introduced the concept of conditional safety certificates (ConSerts) [2, 3] and now, in the DEIS project, the concept of digital dependability identities (DDI) [4]. ConSerts, as well as DDI, are approaches for the definition of modular runtime safety or dependability models, which enable the dynamic evaluation of corresponding properties across system compositions.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{interest}} in farming residues has grown and orchard pruning residues are no exception. Several factors define pruned branch mass and dimensional characteristics: fruit variety, vigor, training system used, and pruning intensity and periodicity.

Detailed qualitative and quantitative knowledge is needed to evaluate the economic sustainability of exploiting orchard pruning residues as an energy source. To assess the real chain potential of renewable energy production from orchard pruning residues {{in the area of}} Cuneo, in the Region of Piedmont, northwestern Italy, a study was conducted on the species Actinidia (kiwi tree) pruned according to the Peyracchia system, and Malus (apple tree) pruned according to two different systems, i. e. traditional and taille longue. For each species, pruning residue amounts were quantified and their basal diameter measured. Surveys were performed on some half trees, spaced as crop, for three randomised replications. Pruning residues were determined by dynamometer (accuracy 0. 02 N); individual cut-off branch diameters were measured at their base with mechanical calipers. Pruning residues were blown by rotating rake and harvested by a modified fixed chamber <b>round</b> <b>baler.</b> Harvest losses were determined by the methodology used for the initial residue quantification. Results showed the average biomass availability was 2. 51 Mg DM ha – 1 (SD 0. 83) for kiwi tree, 3. 04 Mg DM ha – 1 (SD 1. 17) for traditionally-pruned apple trees, and 0. 46 Mg DM ha – 1 (SD 0. 36) for apple trees pruned with the taille longue system. Harvest losses (total pruned dry mass) averaged approximately 19 % in kiwi trees and 16 % in apple trees (95 % to 10 % for variety...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in respect to all farming residues, including orchard pruning residues. The masses and dimensional characteristics of branches pruned, depend on several factors such as fruit variety, active strength plant, training systems, intensity and periodicity pruning. Many studies were done to fix this type of biomass availability, however they’re not up-to-date, and usually they are lacking of accurate surveys. A detailed knowledge of current pruning biomass availability, both qualitative and quantitative, is also necessary for the evaluation of the economic sustainability of their energetic exploitation. In this context, in order to provide an assessment of the real chain potential of energy renewable production, from Cuneo territory pruning residues, a research was conducted on two different orchards species Actinidia (Kiwi tree) and Malus (Apple tree) pruned in two different ways: “traditional system” and “taille longue system”. For each species, pruning residues amount were quantified together with their diameter. The surveys were performed at least on four half trees placed on the same row spacing with three randomized replications in the crop. The amount of pruning residues were determined by a dynamometer (precision 0. 02 N) whereas the diameter of individual cut-off branches has been detected {{at the base of the}} same using a twentieths calliper. Subsequently were performed pruning residues windrowing by rotating rake and the harvest of the same by fixed chamber <b>round</b> <b>baler</b> suitably modified. At the end of these operations have been determined harvesting losses with the same methodology used for the initial quantification of residues. The first result shows that with the “traditional pruning system” the biomass average availability is of 2. 5 t DM ha– 1 and 3. 0 t DM ha– 1, respectively for kiwi tree and apple tree. For the latter, the average values are significantly lower 0. 5 t DM ha– 1 with “taille longue” pruning system. The harvesting losses have been nearly 19 % in kiwi tree and 16 % for apple tree (from 95 % to 11 % according to the variety). In both crops the variation of harvester losses are due mainly to the size and conformation (straight) of pruned branches...|$|E
