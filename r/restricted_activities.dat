40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{number of}} <b>restricted</b> <b>activity</b> days {{experienced}} {{by an individual}} {{in the course of}} a year is an important measure of functional well-being, particularly for older adults. We sought to determine multivariate associations between <b>restricted</b> <b>activity</b> days and various health conditions. METHODS. We used data from the 1984 Supplement on Aging of the National Health Interview Survey to estimate the relationship between <b>restricted</b> <b>activity</b> days and age, gender, and the presence or absence of selected chronic conditions and falls for all noninstitutionalized people aged 65 years and over. Chronic conditions and falls accounted for most of the variance in the model. RESULTS. Of an annual average of 31 <b>restricted</b> <b>activity</b> days, 6 days were associated with falls; 4 days with heart disease; 4 days with arthritis and rheumatism; 2 days each with high blood pressure, cerebrovascular disease, and visual impairment; and 1 day each with atherosclerosis, diabetes, major malignancies, and osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS. These results can be used in estimating the potential impact of health promotion programs on the health status of noninstitutionalized older adults...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} musculoskeletal problems in the Canadian working population and to determine cross sectional associations between such problems and work factors, particularly job strain and physical demand variables.  METHODS—The Canadian 1994  national population health survey (NPHS) sampled 4230  working men and 4043  working women (ages 18 - 64) who answered an abbreviated version of the job content questionnaire. Workers were classified into four strain categories: high, passive, active, and low. Outcomes were <b>restricted</b> <b>activity</b> due to musculoskeletal disorders and the diagnosis of a back problem (both yes or no). Survey weights were incorporated to allow for different probabilities of selection. Logistic regression analyses were carried out separately for women and men, controlling for sociodemographic factors.  RESULTS—Prevalence of chronic back problems diagnosed by a health practitioner was 14. 5 % among men and 12. 5 % among women. Men had a 6. 6 % prevalence of <b>restricted</b> <b>activity</b> due to musculoskeletal disorders, whereas the corresponding figure for women was 5. 3 %. Women, but not men, in high strain jobs {{were more likely to}} report both back problems (odds ratio (OR) 1. 60,  95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 14  to 2. 28) and <b>restricted</b> <b>activity</b> (OR 1. 98,  95 % CI 1. 16  to 3. 48) compared with those in low strain jobs. High physical exertion was an independent predictor of back problems in both sexes. For both men and women, low social support at work and high job insecurity were independent predictors of <b>restricted</b> <b>activity</b> due to musculoskeletal disorders. Conversely, chronic back problems contributed to explanation of high job strain among women (OR 1. 76,  95 % CI 1. 30  to 2. 39) and high physical exertion among men (OR 1. 39,  95 % CI 1. 09  to 1. 77), whereas <b>restricted</b> <b>activity</b> due to musculoskeletal disorders contributed to explanation of high job insecurity in both sexes.  CONCLUSIONS—Associations of interest between work stressors and musculoskeletal problems in this cross sectional study provide evidence for physical and psychosocial factors both affecting disability and being affected by disability in a working population.    Keywords: back pain; cross sectional survey; job strain; Canad...|$|R

[...] The upgrading of the plant was partly funded by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Germany through KfW development bank. In its ex-post evaluation of the project, KfW noted that the plant faced considerable technical difficulties and temporary shutdowns over a period of seven years until it started to work properly. KfW noted that in the spirit of integrated water resources management more should have been done to reduce the per capita water consumption in Windhoek and to protect the Goreangab Dam from pollution, for example by establishing a protection zone with <b>restricted</b> <b>activities</b> around the reservoir.

50|$|Burnett worked {{full-time}} for Ryan Aviation after ending school. One fall, he {{was laid}} off but he, determined to work, returned without pay. This resulted in him receiving flying instruction from the company as a Christmas present later that year in 1925. He began flying on his own after instruction of only four hours. In 1926, before even the federal government <b>restricted</b> <b>activities</b> in the air, the City of San Diego set up licensing for pilots. Burnett was within the first three pilots to receive their licsense from the city. Around this time, Charles Lindbergh came to Ryan to have the Spirit of St. Louis built. Burnett, obsessed with wings, worked on the woodworking and design of the wings. Lindbergh and Burnett became friends throughout the process. Lindbergh's wife even visited Dan's baby shower for his daughter. Before Lindbergh's flight, Burnett asked him to take a one dollar bill and a letter, both signed by Captain Martell and a red carnation given to him by Lieutenant Kelley. The carnation was the first flower to fly across the Atlantic. Lindbergh also said that he prized the possessions. The dollar bill later transferred hands to Sir Hubert Wilkins for his flight to the Antarctic and on Doles' race with Martin Jensen to Honolulu. Dan later worked for a while on parachute development with Jimmy Russell. In 1930, he then worked for the Bowlus Sailplane Company as the Superintendent. Then in 1933, returned to Ryan Aviation. In 1937, he became the foreman of wing and control surface assembly at Ryan. And in 1939, he became the head of the experimental department and was later appointed night superintendent in 1940. The San Diego Air and Space Museum acquired a wing rib jib that Burnett had built for the St. Louis and started selling replica wing ribs in the '80s for $45 along with a certificate of authenticity with Burnetts name on it.

40|$|There {{is a lack}} {{of studies}} {{comparing}} the utility of C-reactive protein (CRP) with Procalcitonin (PCT) for the management of patients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in primary care. Our aim was to study the correlation between these markers and to compare their predictive accuracy in regard to clinical outcome prediction.; This is a secondary analysis using clinical and biomarker data of 458 primary care patients with pneumonic and non-pneumonic ARI. We used correlation statistics (spearman's rank test) and multivariable regression models to assess association of markers with adverse outcome, namely days with <b>restricted</b> <b>activities</b> and persistence of discomfort from infection at day 14.; At baseline, CRP and PCT did not correlate well in the overall population (r(2) [*]=[*] 0. 16) and particularly in the subgroup of patients with non-pneumonic ARI (r(2) [*]=[*] 0. 08). Low correlation of biomarkers were also found when comparing cut-off ranges, day seven levels or changes from baseline to day seven. High baseline levels of CRP (< 100 mg/dL, regression coefficient 1. 6, 95 % CI 0. 5 to 2. 6, sociodemographic-adjusted model) as well as PCT (< 0. 5 ug/L regression coefficient 2. 0, 95 % CI 0. 0 to 4. 0, sociodemographic-adjusted model) were significantly associated with larger number of days with <b>restricted</b> <b>activities.</b> There were no associations of either biomarker with persistence of discomfort at day 14.; CRP and PCT levels do not well correlate, but both have moderate prognostic accuracy in primary care patients with ARI to predict clinical outcomes.

40|$|Background Acute lower {{respiratory}} tract infection (LRTI) presenting in primary care has a long natural history. Antibiotic treatment makes little or no difference to the duration of cough. Limited information is currently available regarding predictors of illness duration. Aim To determine predictors of illness duration in acute LRTI in primary care. Design of study Secondary analysis of trial data to identify independent predictors of illness severity and duration. Setting Primary care. Method Eight-hundred and seven patients aged 3 years and over with acute illness (21 days or less) presenting with cough as the main symptom plus at least one symptom or sign from sputum, chest pain, dyspnoea, or wheeze were recruited to the study. Main outcomes were duration of symptoms (rated at least a slight problem) and more severe symptoms (rated at least moderately bad). Results The average duration of cough (rated at least a slight problem) was 11. 7 days and was shorter among I children (duration - 1. 72 days; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = - 3. 02 to - 0. 41) or in individuals {{with a history of}} fever (- 1. 22 days; 95 % Cl = - 0. 18 to 2. 27). The duration of cough was longer among those with <b>restricted</b> <b>activities</b> on the day they saw the doctor (+ 0. 69 days for each point of a 7 -point scale). The duration of more severe symptoms was longer in those with a longer duration of symptoms prior to consultation, with a more severe cough on the day of seeing the doctor, and restriction of activities on the day of seeing the doctor. Conclusion Illness duration may be predicted from a limited number of clinical symptoms and from prior history. These findings should be subjected to validation in a separate population.
