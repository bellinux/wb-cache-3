5000|$|Fair {{dealing in}} the United Kingdom {{is similar in}} many aspects to Canadian fair dealing, but there are {{important}} differences. It is created by sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988: :s.29 Research and private study.::(1)Fair dealing with a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work {{for the purposes of}} research for a non-commercial purpose does not infringe any copyright in the work provided that it is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement.::(1B)No acknowledgement is required in connection with fair dealing for the purposes mentioned in subsection (1) where this would be impossible for reasons of practicality or otherwise.::(1C)Fair dealing with a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work for the purposes of private study does not infringe any copyright in the work.::(2)Fair dealing with the typographical arrangement of a published edition for the purposes of research or private study does not infringe any copyright in the arrangement.::(3)Copying by a person other than the researcher or student himself is not fair dealing if—:::(a)in the case of a librarian, or a person acting on behalf of a librarian, he does anything which regulations under section 40 would not permit to be done under section 38 or 39 (articles or parts of published works: restriction on multiple copies of same material), or:::(b)in any other case, the person doing the copying knows or has reason to believe that it will result in copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than one person at substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose.:s.30 Criticism, review and news reporting.::(1)Fair dealing with a work for the purpose of criticism or review, of that or another work or of a performance of a work, does not infringe any copyright in the work provided that it is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement and provided that the work has been made available to the public.::(1A)For the purposes of subsection (1) a work has been made available to the public if it has been made available by any means, including—:::(a)the issue of copies to the public;:::(b)making the work available by means of an electronic retrieval system;:::(c)the rental or lending of copies of the work to the public;:::(d)the performance, exhibition, playing or showing of the work in public;:::(e)the communication to the public of the work,::but in determining generally for the purposes of that subsection whether a work has been made available to the public no account shall be taken of any unauthorised act.::(2)Fair dealing with a work (other than a photograph) for the purpose of reporting current events does not infringe any copyright in the work provided that (subject to subsection (3)) it is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement.::(3)No acknowledgement is required in connection with the reporting of current events by means of a sound recording, film or broadcast where this would be impossible for reasons of practicality or otherwise. It requires the dealing to be for one of three purposes: non-commercial research or private study, criticism or <b>review,</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> of news events. As in Canada, the dealing must be fair and there must be attribution for non-commercial research, criticism/review, and reporting of news events. Attribution need not occur where it would be impossible for reasons of practicality or otherwise. Factors to be considered in respect of the [...] "fairness" [...] of the dealing include the quantity of the work taken, {{whether or not it was}} previously published, the motives of the infringer and the effect on the market for the work. Similar to the emphasis on public interest and free of expression required by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Human Rights Act necessitates a liberal construction to accommodate considerations of public interest.|$|E

30|$|This SLR follows stages {{proposed}} in [36], namely planning a review, conducting a <b>review,</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> and dissemination. Planning involves identifying, analyzing, and synthesizing behavioral factors influencing logistics collaboration and partner trust. It employs SCC and trust as topics. Correspondingly, five electronic databases to search in Science Direct, Wiley Online Library, Emerald, Springer, and IEEE are selected. These databases contain rich publications {{in the areas}} of logistics, supply chain, collaboration, and trust. Concurrent to a search process, a search strategy applies general and specific queries. General query is a form of a search question containing all search terms in one search string under single execution. The specific query contains few search terms executable sequentially under multiple options. General query is applied to databases supporting expert search, while the specific query is applied to remaining databases.|$|E

40|$|The European Union (EU) has {{undoubtedly}} made enormous {{strides in}} developing a progressive environmental policy, but many of its own policies actively undermine the pursuit of sustainable development. In {{the aftermath of the}} 1999 Amsterdam Treaty, the EU is finally beginning to confront the thorny problem of how to 'green' itself. The vehicle selected to reach this goal is the so-called 'Cardiff process' of <b>review</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting,</b> which is currently exploring the opportunities to achieve environmental policy integration (EPI) at the European level. However, it is argued that in order to 'green' the EU, member states must also take complementary steps to green themselves by implementing EPI at national and sub-national levels. The progress hitherto made by four of the 'greenest' states of the EU, namely Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK, is examined in order to investigate the opportunities for cross-national learning in this politically and ecologically important area of contemporary European environmental policy...|$|E

The JAWSAT project required both new technical designs as well as new programmatic ways of conducting a space mission. Main stream, large satellite, methods were not adequate. Technical lessons learned on this project range from new techniques in versatile, low-cost, structural design to a reasonable method of qualifying commercial off-theshelf electronic components. New methods of final integration and ride sharing were also invented. In program management, new methods in documentation, technical exchange, design <b>review</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> were developed.

40|$|The 1990 's saw {{a growing}} {{emphasis}} on biodiversity, and recognition that maximising biodiversity in protected areas was dependent upon good management practices, including fire management. In 1994, the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council's (ANZECC) Standing Committee on Conservation initiated a Best Practice Program across {{a number of}} key areas of natural resource management, including reviewing best practice in the ecological use of fire in protected areas. One of the aims of the Best Practice Program was to utilise benchmarking and best practice principles to share knowledge and information about the management of protected areas. This shared knowledge and information could then aid continuous improvement in the management of natural and cultural resources and the provision of services to the community. A lead agency was nominated for each program area to coordinate the assessment, <b>review</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> on benchmarking and best practice.
