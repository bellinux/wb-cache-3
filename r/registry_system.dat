5|$|Following the {{approval}} of the new Constitution, the 2009 general election was called. The opposition sought to delay the election by demanding a new biometric <b>registry</b> <b>system,</b> hoping that it would give them time to form a united front against MAS. Many MAS activists reacted violently against the demands, and attempting to prevent this. Morales went on a five-day hunger strike in April 2009 to push the opposition to rescind their demands. He also agreed to allow for the introduction of a new voter registry, but insisted that it was rushed through so as not to delay the election. Morales and the MAS won with a landslide majority, polling 64.2%, while voter participation had reached an all-time high of 90%. His primary opponent, Reyes Villa, gained 27% of the vote. The MAS won a two-thirds majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Morales notably increased his support in the east of the country, with MAS gaining a majority in Tarija.|$|E

2500|$|The {{popularity}} of dog and pet keeping generated animal fancy. [...] Dog fanciers showed enthusiasm for owning pets, breeding dogs, and showing dogs in various shows. [...] The first dog show {{took place on}} 28 June 1859 in Newcastle and focused mostly on sporting and hunting dogs. [...] However, pet owners produced an eagerness to demonstrate their pets as well as have an outlet to compete. [...] Thus, pet animals gradually were included within dog shows. [...] The first large show, which would host one thousand entries, took place in Chelsea in 1863. [...] The Kennel Club was created in 1873 to ensure fairness and organization within dog shows. The development of the Stud Book by the Kennel Club defined policies, presented a national <b>registry</b> <b>system</b> of purebred dogs, and essentially institutionalized dog shows.|$|E
2500|$|In 1909, the Korean Empire {{established}} a civil registration law, starting {{the creation of}} a modern family <b>registry</b> <b>system.</b> With regard to the recording of details about women such as the father's surname, age, and connection to the registry holder, due to attention that needed to be given to avoiding conflict with Korean customs, the drafting of the law was not completed until April 1910, just before the annexation of Korea. By that time, a portion of Koreans had already registered Japanese-style names and the like, which generated confusion. As a result, on the basis of memoranda such as Order No. 124, [...] "Document regarding name changes by Koreans" [...] issued by the Governor-General of Korea on November 11, 1911, the use by Koreans of [...] "names which might be mistaken for those of native Japanese" [...] was no longer permitted, and strict controls were placed on the registration of Japanese-style names for newborn children. Additionally, Koreans who had registered Japanese-style names on there were required to revert to their original names.|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of distributed Web Service registries {{is an important}} issue {{in the context of a}} Web Services based distributed <b>system.</b> The current <b>registry</b> management <b>systems</b> and proposals for distributed service registries are investigated. Through this investigation, it was discovered that none of the existing proposals satisfy all the requirements of scalability, availability, ease of management and flexibility in terms of the {{management of}} the registries. Therefore, a Meta-Directory based <b>registry</b> management <b>system</b> is introduced in this thesis. The system uses distributed Meta-Directory nodes for the management of the service <b>registries.</b> The <b>system</b> also provides flexibility as the routing used for inter-connecting the distributed Meta-Directory nodes can be selected during deployment to accommodate system requirements. The distributed Meta-Directory architecture enhances system performance by allowing the user to choose an appropriate network model, during configuration, based on the system state such as bandwidth available and maximum allowable delay per query message...|$|R

5000|$|In certain rural {{developing}} areas, such as northeastern Brazil, infant births {{are often}} not recorded in the first place, resulting in the discrepancies between the infant mortality rate (IMR) and the actual amount of infant deaths. Access to vital <b>registry</b> <b>systems</b> for infant births and deaths is an extremely difficult and expensive task for poor parents living in rural areas. Government and bureaucracies tend to show an insensitivity to these parents and their recent suffering from a lost child, and produce broad disclaimers in the IMR reports that the information has not been properly reported, resulting in these discrepancies. Little {{has been done to}} address the underlying structural problems of the vital <b>registry</b> <b>systems</b> in respect to the lack of reporting from parents in rural areas, and in turn has created a gap between the official and popular meanings of child death. It is also argued that the bureaucratic separation of vital death recording from cultural death rituals is to blame for the inaccuracy of the infant mortality rate (IMR). Vital death registries often fail to recognize the cultural implications and importance of infant deaths. It is not to be said that vital <b>registry</b> <b>systems</b> are not an accurate representation of a region's socio-economic situation, but this is only the case if these statistics are valid, which is unfortunately not always the circumstance. [...] "Popular death reporters" [...] is an alternative method for collecting and processing statistics on infant and child mortality. Many regions may benefit from [...] "popular death reporters" [...] who are culturally linked to infants may be able to provide more accurate statistics on the incidence of infant mortality. According to ethnographic data, [...] "popular death reporters" [...] refers to people who had inside knowledge of anjinhos, including the grave-digger, gatekeeper, midwife, popular healers etc. —— all key participants in mortuary rituals. By combining the methods of household surveys, vital registries, and asking [...] "popular death reporters" [...] this can increase the validity of child mortality rates, but there are many barriers that can reflect the validity of our statistics of infant mortality. One of these barriers are political economic decisions. Numbers are exaggerated when international funds are being doled out; and underestimated during reelection.|$|R
