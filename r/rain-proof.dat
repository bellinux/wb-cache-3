2500|$|Cormac's Chapel, {{the chapel}} of King Cormac Mac Carthaigh, was begun in 1127 and consecrated in 1134. It is a {{sophisticated}} structure, with vaulted ceilings and wide arches, drawing on contemporary European architecture and infusing unique native elements. [...] The Irish Abbot of Regensburg, Dirmicius of Regensburg, sent {{two of his}} carpenters {{to help in the}} work and the twin towers {{on either side of the}} junction of the nave and [...] are strongly suggestive of their Germanic influence, as this feature is otherwise unknown in Ireland. [...] Other notable features of the building include interior and exterior arcading, a barrel-vaulted roof, a carved tympanum over both doorways, the magnificent north doorway and chancel arch. [...] It contains one of the best-preserved Irish frescoes from this time period. The Chapel was constructed primarily of sandstone which has become waterlogged over the centuries, significantly damaging the interior frescos. [...] Restoration and preservation required the chapel be completely enclosed in a <b>rain-proof</b> structure with interior dehumidifiers to dry out the stone.|$|E

Helen's body kept warm, but her extremities and ears began to suffer exceedingly. She gazed ahead grimly. There was no help; {{she had to go}} on. Dale and Roy were hunched down in their saddles, probably wet through, for they wore no <b>rain-proof</b> coats. Bo kept close behind them, and plain it was that she felt the cold.|$|E
6000|$|At last {{we reached}} the Trossachs Hotel, which stands near the wild ravines filled with bristling woods where the stag was lost, with the lovely lake in front and Ben-Venue towering {{up on the other}} side. I was so excited I could {{scarcely}} eat, and no wonder, because for the greater part of the day I had breathed nothing but the spirit of Scott's poetry. I forgot to say that from the time we left Callander until we got to the hotel the rain poured down steadily, but that didn't make any difference to me.

60|$|In {{a week he}} had {{showed me}} all his hiding places. The most {{interesting}} of these was over a roofed piazza in a building near by. He had gnawed a hole under the eaves, where {{it would not be}} noticed, and lived there in solitary grandeur during stormy days in a den four by eight feet, and <b>rain-proof.</b> In one corner was a bushel of corncobs, some of them two or three years old, which he had stolen from a cornfield near by in the early autumn mornings. With characteristic improvidence he had fallen to eating the corn while yet there was plenty more to be gathered. In consequence he was hungry before February was half over, and living by his wits, like his brother of the wilderness.|$|E
60|$|I {{walked with}} the Haughts from our camp across the brook to theirs, where {{we sat down}} in the warm sunshine. I made light of this hunting trip in which it had turned out I had no gun, no horse, no blankets, no <b>rain-proof</b> tent, no {{adequate}} amount of food supplies, and no good luck, except the wonderful good luck of being well, of seeing a magnificent country, of meeting some more fine westerners. But the Haughts appeared a little slow to grasp, or at least to credit my philosophy. We were just beginning to get acquainted. Their regret was that they had been unable to see me get a bear, a deer, a lion, and some turkeys. Their conviction, perhaps formed from association with many sportsman hunters, was that owing to my bad luck I could not and would not want to come again.|$|E
60|$|Her {{resolution}} fixed, Helen {{changed her}} skirt {{for one of}} buckskin, putting on leggings and moccasins of the same serviceable material. She filled the pockets of a short, <b>rain-proof</b> jacket with biscuits, and, thus equipped, sallied forth with a spirit and exultation she could not subdue. Only one thing she feared, which was that Brandt or Metzar might see her cross the river. She launched her canoe and paddled down stream, under cover of the bluff, to a point opposite {{the end of the}} island, then straight across, keeping the island between her and the settlement. Gaining the other shore, Helen pulled the canoe into the willows, and mounted the bank. A thicket of willow and alder made progress up the steep incline difficult, but once out of it she faced a long stretch of grassy meadowland. A mile beyond began the green, billowy rise of that mountain which she intended to climb.|$|E

60|$|However, I had {{determined}} to go, and had prepared myself for every emergency. I had designed an insect-proof tent, and was {{provided with a}} rubber mattress, a down sleeping-bag, <b>rain-proof</b> clothing, and stout shoes. I purchased, as did many of the others, two bills of goods from the Hudson Bay Company, to be delivered at Hazleton on the Skeena, and at Glenora on the Stikeen. Even with this arrangement {{it was necessary to}} carry every crumb of food, in one case three hundred and sixty miles, and in the other case four hundred miles. However, the first two hundred and twenty miles would be in the nature of a practice march, for the trail ran through a country with occasional ranches where feed could be obtained. We planned to start with four horses, taking on others as we needed them. And for one week we scrutinized the ponies swarming around the corrals, in an attempt to find two packhorses that would not give out on the trail, or buck their packs off at the start.|$|E

According to {{data about}} GIS {{breakdown}} maintenance in Maintenance Branch of State Grid Chongqing Electric Power Company during recent years, GIS accident of Chongqing Electric Power Company that happens every year is internal fault of local air chambers (such as breaker, PT and bus) in most cases. Once accident happens, a high requirement will be proposed for water prevention and damp prevention {{at the site}} during either on-site inspection for the accident cause or replacement for the damaged equipment. In order to effectively cover the first hole of the opened GIS air chamber and make the operation environment meet <b>rain-proof</b> and damp-proof requirements during internal examination for GIS air chamber, a design scheme of mobile GIS maintenance room is proposed in this paper. SF 6 detection equipment as well as temperature and humidity examination equipment is installed in the maintenance room, so as to measure multiple parameters and to guarantee light transmission, ventilation and fire resistance. It is convenient for installation and disassembly, and the space can be adjusted. It is suitable for GIS equipment maintenance at the voltage class of 220 kV...|$|E

Muskrats and beaver will eat the rootstock and young shoots. Muskrats also use the stems for building their houses. Water Treatment/Erosion Control: Hardstem bulrush’s dense root mass makes this species an excellent choice for soil stabilization. Its above ground biomass provides protection from erosive wave action and stream currents that erode shorelines or stream banks. The rhizomatous root system also forms a matrix for many beneficial bacteria, making this plant an excellent choice for wastewater treatment (Hurd et al., 1994). Ethnobotany: The young sprouts and shoots of hardstem bulrush can be eaten raw or cooked, and the rhizomes and unripe flower heads can be boiled as a vegetable. Hardstem bulrush rhizomes were also sundried and pounded {{into a kind of}} flour. Bulrush pollen is eaten as flour in bread, mush or pancakes. The seeds can be beaten off into baskets or pails, ground into meal and used as flour. Tule houses were common throughout many parts of California; the overlapping tule mats made homes wellinsulated and <b>rain-proof.</b> The walls and roofs were thatched with mats of tule or cattail and secured to the frame. In Nevada, tules and willows were bound together in a sort of crude weaving for "Kani", the Paiute name for summerhouse [...] Hardstem bulrush was also used to make shoes, skirts, baby diapers, bedding, and duck decoys.
