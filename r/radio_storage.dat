During {{the spring and summer of}} 2000, 228 adult Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshaw-ytscha were tagged at Bonneville Dam with archival <b>radio</b> data <b>storage</b> transmitters (RDSTs) that recorded depth and water temperature as the fish migrated through dams and reservoirs of the lower Columbia and Snake rivers. Swimming depths from 131 of the 228 adult spring and summer Chinook salmon tagged with RDSTs were used to estimate the potential for gas bubble formation given in-river dissolved gas concentrations and hydrostatic compensation. We found that adult spring and summer Chinook salmon spent a majority of the time at depths that would have provided adequate hydrostatic compensation for in-river dissolved gas conditions during this study, which were at or slightly below long-term averages.

40|$|Mass {{accuracy}} {{is a key}} parameter of mass spectrometric performance. TOF instruments can reach low parts per million, and FT-ICR instruments are capable of even greater accuracy provided ion numbers are well controlled. Here we demonstrate sub-ppm mass accuracy on a linear ion trap coupled via a <b>radio</b> frequency-only <b>storage</b> trap (C-trap) to the orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap). Prior to acquisition of a spectrum, a background ion originating from ambient air is first transferred to the C-trap. Ions forming the MS or MS n spectrum are then added to this species, and all ions are injected into the orbitrap for analysis. Real time recalibration on the “lock mass ” by corrections of mass shift removes mass error associated with calibration of the mass scale. The remaining mass error is mainly due to imperfect peaks caused by weak signals and is addressed by averaging the mass measurement over the LC peak, weighted by signal intensity. For peptide database searches in proteomics, we introduce a variable mass tolerance and achieve average absolute mass deviations of 0. 48 ppm (standard deviation 0. 38 ppm) and maximal deviations of less than 2 ppm. For tandem mass spectra we demonstrate similarly high mass accuracy and discuss its impact on database searching. High and routine mass accuracy in a compact instrument will dramatically improve certainty of peptide and small molecule identification...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPerforming {{wideband}} ion {{image current}} detection mass spectrometry experiments {{with an electric}} ion trap—e. g., the Paul trap—is a difficult task, {{as there is a}} strong crosstalk current induced by the high voltages of the <b>radio</b> frequency (rf) <b>storage</b> field. In a classic Paul trap the metallic hyperbolic electrodes (a ring electrode and two end cap electrodes) are shaped following the isopotential lines of the quadrupole potential distribution. In our new design the ring electrode is replaced by a cylindrical series of ring electrodes with a parabolic potential distribution, whereas the end cap electrodes are used without modification. Thus the quadrupole field within the trap remains unchanged but the capacitances between the electrodes and therefore the crosstalk currents are significantly reduced. The remaining crosstalk is balanced out by an electronic compensation technique. As a consequence the weak signals of the ion-induced charge can be detected with a wideband low-noise amplifier to perform Fourier transform mass spectrometry experiments with improved signal-to-noise ratio...|$|R

40|$|The {{superior}} reconfigurability {{of software}} defined radio mobile devices has made {{it one of the}} most promising technology on the wireless network and in the mobile communication industry. The evolution from a static and rigid system to a highly dynamic environment, which offers many advantages over current systems, has been made possible thanks to the concepts of programmability and reconfigurability introduced by the {{software defined radio}} technology and the higher level of flexibility and openness of this technology's devices. Clearly, the software defined radio mobile device's flexibility is a great advantage since the customer is able to use the same device in different parts of the world, with different wireless technologies. Despite the advantages, there are still issues to be discussed regarding security. According to the Software Defined Radio Forum some of the concerns are the <b>radio</b> configuration download, <b>storage</b> and installation, user's privacy, and cloning. To address the SDR Forum concerns a raud-prevention framework is proposed. The framework is composed by new pieces of hardware, new modules and new protocols that together greatly enhance the overall security of software defined radio mobile devices and this new highly dynamic environment. The framework offers security monitoring against malicious attacks and viruses that may affect the configuration data; protects sensitive information through the use of protected storage; creates and protects an identity for the system; employs a secure and efficient protocol for radio configuration download and update; and finally, establishes an anti-cloning scheme, which not only guarantees that no units can be cloned over the air but also elevates the level of difficulty to clone units if the attacker has physical access to those units. Even if cloned units exist, the anti-cloning scheme is able to identify them and deny any service. Ph. D.

40|$|Modern {{smartphones}} {{are increasingly}} performant and feature-rich, {{but because they}} are battery powered, remain highly power-constrained. Energy management is the art and science of maximising battery lifetime, and effectively doing so requires a solid understanding of how a devices uses energy to inform policy and algorithms backed by accurate data. This work addresses each of these issues. First, we present a detailed power analysis of two smartphones, the Openmoko Freerunner and the Samsung Galaxy S III. We measure power consumption by direct instrumentation at the circuit level by interposing on the power supplies of the individual components, including CPU, RAM, display, GPU, wireless <b>radios,</b> camera, GPS, <b>storage,</b> audio, and environmental sensors. With this instrumentation in place, we produce breakdowns of how energy is distributed under micro-benchmarks and realistic usage scenarios. We also measure two other devices at the whole-system level to validate our earlier results, and to draw conclusions about how smartphone power consumption is changing over time. Additional to the results presented, we also describe a methodology for instrumenting commercial mass-market off-the-shelf devices. Based on these measurements we observe that peak CPU energy consumption is increasing due to the advent of multi-core processors in the mobile segment. Thus, effective power management of these will be important for battery life on future mobile devices. Such multi-core processors add a new dimension, the number cores active, to the spectrum of available energy management mechanisms. In the second part of this work we investigate how this mechanism, which we call core offlining, interacts with the well-established technique of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) for minimising power consumption. We find surprising differences in the characteristics of contemporaneous smartphones, specifically in the importance of static power, which we show to be a critical factor in minimising energy consumption. We design and implement medusa, a policy that exploits our findings to integrate core offlining with DVFS in the Linux kernel. We show that despite its simplicity, medusa obtains energy savings that are at least as good as, and often better than, the algorithms that ship on the studied phones, and that it approaches the optimal static algorithm...|$|R
2500|$|Toyota Australia {{released}} {{the second generation}} Camry in April 1987. Local manufacture of the V20 had begun earlier in February at its recently acquired Australian Motor Industries facility at Port Melbourne, Victoria {{as a replacement for}} the Corona T140 and the Camry before it. Four-cylinder engine production and panel-stamping was undertaken at Toyota's Altona, Victoria plant, all part of a model localization and factory upgrades investment totalling [...] In fact, it was the first Camry made outside Japan, and is notable for being the most localized Toyota Australia product thus far with a lead time of less than six months, the shortest yet between start of Japanese and Australian manufacture. Higher levels of specification were fitted with the locally built 2.0-liter 3S-FE motor, but the imported 1.8-liter 1S-i unit distinguished base SE and CS cars. Both sedans and wagons were offered and either engine offered standard five-speed manual transmission, upgradeable to the four-speed automatic. Features standard at the base level SE comprised: AM/FM <b>radio,</b> centre console <b>storage</b> compartment, remote fuel filler release, intermittent windscreen wipers, digital clock. CS cars added a tilt steering column to which the CS-X adds a key lock warning system. The CS driver's seat has front height adjustment; the CS-X's front and rear height adjustment. The CS gets a two speaker AM/FM radio cassette player; the CS-X a four-speaker system and automatic electric antenna, plus central locking, variable intermittent wipers and center rear arm rest. The sedan-only Ultima grade gains power windows, cruise control, automatic transmission as standard, velour trim, and a nine-stage graphic equalizer for the audio system. A fleet-focused Executive pack based on the SE arrived in May 1988, adding automatic transmission, power steering, and air conditioning. In June 1988, the 2.5-liter V6 was introduced, being an imported fully optioned model from Japan sold in limited numbers and distinguished from local four-cylinder cars by its unique bumpers and trim. Coinciding with the August 1989 facelift, the 2.0-liter 3S-FC engine with carburetor superseded the imported 1.8. The updates brought minor adjustments inside and out, including improved suspension, steering, and headlights. In May 1991, Toyota made the fuel-injected 3S-FE version standard upon the carburetored engine's deletion, and the CS trim level became CSi. Coinciding with this change, power steering became standard fitment and Toyota Australia refreshed badging, including the attachment of the new corporate logo consisting of three overlapping ellipses to form the letter [...] "T". With the May 1991 update, the Ultima models gained a CD player, the first Australian-built car to offer this. Towards the end of the series, special editions were released, starting with the Spirit of February 1991. Then in September 1992, value-added CSi Limited and Olympic Spirit cars came onto the scene. Australian production ended in late November 1992, in time for production of the XV10 to commence on 2 December. The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, found that V20 Camry models provide an [...] "average" [...] (3/5 stars) level of occupant safety protection {{in the event of an}} accident.|$|R
