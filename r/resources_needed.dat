5|$|Franklin {{points out}} that the {{technological}} nature of war requires states to conscript the <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> to pay for hi-tech devices designed for destruction.

5|$|His {{government}} {{was recognized by}} the western Allies. Nonetheless Sikorski's government struggled to get its point of view heard by France and the United Kingdom.

Furthermore, he struggled to secure <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> to recreate the Polish Army in exile.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1973, {{there was}} serious debate among the Hanoi {{leadership}} over future military policy as the Central Committee of the Lao Động Party convened to assess the progress of its efforts in the south. General Văn Tiến Dũng, PAVN chief of staff, and Defence Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp strongly urged the resumption of conventional military operations, warning that increasing passivity would affect {{the morale of the}} army. Premier Phạm Văn Đồng, however, feared resuming operations would drain vital <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> for reconstruction in the north.|$|E

Thus a model was developed to estimate the facilities (number of beds) needed for such patients in the North-west Region; national <b>resource</b> <b>needs</b> could be obtained by multiplying the regional needs by eleven. The model predicted an unforeseen demand for hospital and satellite unit facilities and for unit back-up beds.

5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although {{it was able to}} put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, Marie Curie {{became a}} member of the newly created International Commission for Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. In 1923, she wrote a {{biography}} of Pierre, entitled Pierre Curie. In 1925, she visited Poland, to participate in the ceremony that laid foundations for the Radium Institute in Warsaw. Her second American tour, in 1929, succeeded in equipping the Warsaw Radium Institute with radium; it was opened in 1932 and her sister Bronisława became its director. These distractions from her scientific labours and the attendant publicity caused her much discomfort but provided <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> for her work. In 1930, she was elected a member of the International Atomic Weights Committee where she served until her death.|$|E
5|$|In June 1975, O'Neill led a ten-week {{study of}} {{permanent}} space habitats at NASA Ames. During the study {{he was called}} away to testify on July 23 to the House Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. On January 19, 1976, he also appeared before the Senate Subcommittee on Aerospace Technology and National Needs. In a presentation titled Solar Power from Satellites, he laid out his case for an Apollo-style program for building power plants in space. He returned to Ames in June 1976 and 1977 to lead studies on space manufacturing. In these studies, NASA developed detailed plans to establish bases on the Moon where space-suited workers would mine the mineral <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> to build space colonies and solar power satellites.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June 1941, Germany, {{supported}} by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary. The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, {{with the ultimate}} goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum ("living space") by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.|$|E
5|$|San Martín {{proposed}} to mediate between Buenos Aires and the Federal League led by Artigas. He {{thought that the}} civil war was counter-productive to national unity, and that an end to hostilities would free <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> for the navy. He calculated that Artigas might condition the peace on a joint declaration of war to colonial Brazil; so San Martín {{proposed to}} defeat the royalists first and then demand {{the return of the}} Eastern Bank to the United Provinces. O'Higgins recommended caution, fearing that San Martín might be captured. Pueyrredón rejected the mediation, as he did not recognize Artigas as an equal to negotiate with him.|$|E
5|$|De Gomme {{prepared}} several {{plans for}} the King in 1665; a further iteration of the designs was submitted in 1670 and given royal approval. Work began the same year but it took until 1685 to complete the project. The work {{was carried out by}} skilled contractors, who were supplemented by large teams of pressed men brought in from across the region; during 1671, up to 256 workers were employed on the site. Around 3,000 timber piles had to be brought from Norway for the project in 1671 to support the foundations in the marshy ground. The <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> for the King's multiple defence projects became stretched, and one of the planned bastions at Tilbury, originally planned to face the river, was cancelled in 1681, in part to save money. The total cost of the project is unknown, but was significantly more than the original estimate of £47,000.|$|E

5|$|San Martín was {{not well}} {{received}} in Buenos Aires. Pueyrredón initially declined to give further help, citing the conflicts with the federal caudillos {{and the organization of}} a huge royalist army in Cádiz that would try to reconquer the La Plata basin. He thought that Chile should organize the navy against Peru, not Buenos Aires. San Martín discussed with him and finally got financing of 500,000 pesos. He returned to Mendoza with his wife and daughter and received a letter from Pueyrredón, who said that Buenos Aires could only deliver one-third of the promised funds. This complicated the project, as neither Santiago de Chile nor Mendoza had the <b>resources</b> <b>needed.</b> San Martín resigned from the Army, but it is unclear whether his decision to resign was sincere or was to apply pressure to his backers. The government of Buenos Aires still considered San Martín vital to the national defense, so Pueyrredón agreed to pay the 500,000 pesos requested, and encouraged San Martín to withdraw his resignation.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Combined Development Trust was to {{purchase}} or control the mineral <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> by the Manhattan Project, and to avoid competition between the three. Britain had little need for uranium ores while the war continued, but was anxious to secure adequate supplies for its own nuclear weapons programme when it ended. Half the funding was {{to come from the}} United States and half from Britain and Canada. The initial $12.5 million was transferred to Groves from an account {{in the office of the}} United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., that was not subject to the usual accounting auditing and oversight. By the time Groves resigned from the Trust at the end of 1947, he had deposited $37.5 million into an account he controlled at the Bankers Trust. Payments were then made from this account.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E
