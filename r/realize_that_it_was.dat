No gears would have been attached to it, so perhaps the author of the description did not mention it because he did not <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{an important part of the}} mechanism. Putting such a wheel on the chariot and making it function properly would not have been difficult. It might have been attached to the pole to which the horses were harnessed. Stops would have been provided to limit the motions of the pole to left and right.|$|E

There is still that singular perfection, and it's perfect in part because it seemed, at the time, so clearly to promise more. Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other. p98, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition.|$|E

[...] He met with Ouro Preto, and undertook to personally present the Emperor {{with a list}} of the names of those to be included in a new cabinet. To the disillusionment of civilian and military republicans, Deodoro did not proclaim a republic, and it seemed that he would only topple the cabinet. He was unsure whether he wanted to act against Pedro II, and the rebels themselves did not believe the coup would succeed. The few people who witnessed what occurred did not <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a rebellion, and according to the republican Aristides Lobo, the populace was [...] "stunned".

[...] He added that the additional camera lenses used by director Jerry Finnerman in that episode for close-ups of her quivering lip only [...] "served to emphasize the lack of character written into the character." [...] He had complained to Roddenberry of Barrett's acting skills, but stopped when {{he became aware of}} their relationship. It was only after Barrett's first appearance as Lwaxana Troi in the [...] episode [...] "", that he came to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the Chapel character he disliked, not Barrett herself and told her that his opinion had changed. Barrett also didn't care for the character of Chapel, saying [...] "I've never been a real aficionado of Nurse Chapel, I figured she was kind of weak and namdy-pamdy." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{there was}} no desire in Brazil among the {{majority}} of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy. They launched a coup d'état, arrested Prime Minister Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889. The few people who witnessed what occurred did not <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a rebellion. Historian Lídia Besouchet noted that [...] "arely has a revolution been so minor." [...] During the ordeal PedroII showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He dismissed all suggestions for quelling the rebellion that politicians and military leaders put forward. When he heard the news of his deposition he simply commented: [...] "If it is so, it will be my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then."

Although there was significant monarchist reaction {{after the fall of the}} Empire, this was thoroughly suppressed, and neither PedroII nor his daughter supported a restoration. Despite being unaware of the plans for a coup, once it occurred and in light of the Emperor's passive acceptance of the situation, the political establishment supported the end of the monarchy in favor of a republic. They were unaware that the goal of the coup leaders was the creation of a dictatorial republic rather than a presidential or parliamentary republic.|$|E
500|$|Matsoukas {{initially}} {{planned the}} music video to visualize Beyoncé winning the contest, {{where she would}} <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> meaningless to her. However, Beyoncé suggested that an albino should serve as the contest's winner instead. Speaking to MTV News, Matsoukas elaborated: [...] "We thought it was really important and interesting to break those ideas of what the classic beauty standards would be and {{to do this with}} this beautiful albino woman, I thought was really great. And to show 'Yeah she's not perfect, she doesn't always win and you put your best foot forward and you may still lose.'" [...] The video's ending was originally intended to depict archival footage of American actresses Halle Berry and Vanessa A. Williams, to promote beauty for African-American women. However, Beyoncé sent a note to Matsoukas suggesting that footage from her childhood should be interpolated {{at the end of the}} song in order to connect it to the second music video from the album, [...] "Ghost".|$|E
500|$|Several astronomers tested Kepler's theory, and {{its various}} modifications, against astronomical observations. Two transits of Venus and Mercury {{across the face}} of the sun {{provided}} sensitive tests of the theory, under circumstances when these planets could not normally be observed. In the case of the transit of Mercury in 1631, Kepler had been extremely uncertain of the parameters for Mercury, and advised observers to look for the transit the day before and after the predicted date. [...] Pierre Gassendi observed the transit on the date predicted, a confirmation of Kepler's prediction. This was the first observation of a transit of Mercury. However, his attempt to observe the transit of Venus just one month later was unsuccessful due to inaccuracies in the Rudolphine Tables. Gassendi did not <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not visible from most of Europe, including Paris. [...] Jeremiah Horrocks, who observed the 1639 Venus transit, had used his own observations to adjust the parameters of the Keplerian model, predicted the transit, and then built apparatus to observe the transit. He remained a firm advocate of the Keplerian model.|$|E

500|$|The Wrath of Khan {{features}} several recurring themes, including death, resurrection, {{and growing}} old. Upon writing his script, Meyer hit upon {{a link between}} Spock's death {{and the age of}} the characters. [...] "This {{was going to be a}} story in which Spock died, so it was going to be a story about death, and it was only a short hop, skip, and a jump to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be about old age and friendship," [...] Meyer said. [...] "I don't think that any of [...] scripts were about old age, friendship, and death." [...] In keeping with the theme of death and rebirth symbolized by Spock's sacrifice and the Genesis Device, Meyer wanted to call the film The Undiscovered Country, in reference to Prince Hamlet's description of death in William Shakespeare's Hamlet, but the title was changed during editing without his knowledge. Meyer disliked Wrath of Khan, but it was chosen because the preferred Vengeance of Khan conflicted with Lucasfilm's forthcoming Revenge of the Jedi (renamed Return of the Jedi late in production).|$|E
500|$|Developers {{originally}} intended for players to be permanently {{out of a}} race when falling far off a track, however they came to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not fun for players [...] "to be forced to go slow or suffer an instant defeat." [...] An {{attempt was made to}} give three [...] "strikes" [...] to a rider. [...] Once the rider fell for the third time they were out of the race. [...] However once implemented developers noticed that the number of racers remaining {{at the end of the}} race was too random to be deemed any fun. [...] In the end the decision was made to simply respawn the character on the track. The PC version was ported in large part by John Olsen, who worked on the port as his first task at SingleTrac. [...] The PC version also features 3Dfx hardware acceleration, which allows for higher resolution gameplay and visual enhancements such as reflective water. [...] Axiom Design created the user interface shell for the game, which has a comic book-inspired feel. The music for Jet Moto was produced by Big Idea Music Productions.|$|E
500|$|... "There's Got to Be a Morning After Pill" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great." [...] He {{thought that it was}} indicative of an overall upward trend in the quality of Veronica Mars and praised the episode's balance between the case-of-the-week and the Dean O'Dell story arc. [...] "Like last week's episode, 'There's Got to Be a Morning After Pill' benefited from integrating already established characters into a mystery of the week." [...] He was positive towards the mystery of the week in general, stating that it made him <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to make good episodes with only a stand-alone mystery. However, he was critical of the development of Veronica and Logan's relationship, particularly Logan's new character traits. [...] "Let's just hope they don't get back together again next week, or anytime soon, because this horse has been beaten to death as it is." [...] Kelly West of Cinema Blend was positive towards the episode, calling it [...] "jam-packed with drama". However, she stated that she would have enjoyed the episode more if Mac, Piz, Wallace, or Parker had made an appearance. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall enjoyed the pairing of Bonnie and her father, played by Chris Ellis.|$|E

500|$|Yichang {{decided to}} organise an {{arranged}} marriage for Mao, selecting {{for him the}} seventeen-year-old Luo Yigu, {{the daughter of a}} local landowner. Although unhappy with the arrangement, Mao agreed to go through with the marriage, with the wedding taking place in 1907 or 1908. According to his later account however, he never consummated the marriage and refused to live with Luo. Instead, he claimed that he made use of connections with his maternal family to leave his parental home and move into the house of an unemployed student in Shaoshan, where he lived for a year. There, he continued his reading, enjoying tales of ancient Chinese rulers such as Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian and Ban Gu's History of the Former Han Dynasty. He was also influenced by Feng Guifen's Personal Protests from the Study of Jiao Bin, which had been compiled in 1861. Like Guanying's book, it called on China to adopt foreign techniques to strengthen itself, and to use them to defend itself from foreign aggression. Mao also read a pamphlet by the Chinese revolutionary Chen Tianhua, which recounted China's loss of sovereignty to Japanese and European imperialists; [...] Mao claimed that this was a great influence on him, for after reading it [...] "I felt depressed about the future of my country and began to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the duty of all the people to help save it." [...] Meanwhile, Luo was locally disgraced and eventually died of dysentery in 1910, while Qimei moved to live with her brother's family in her native village of Xiangxiang.|$|E
