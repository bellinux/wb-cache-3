Titrimetric method was used to estimate the main constituents of imported refractory orylex mortar and local river sand. It was observed that silicon fire-clay, fire clay and high alumina refractory binder used in binding bricks at the calcining and safety zones of cement kiln have related constituents as the local river sand and clays. The local <b>refractory</b> <b>mortar</b> was produced by subjecting milled local river sand to heat with subsequent reduction of the sinter size. This is then mixed with prepared sodium silicate solution of various concentrations to give a locally produced composite binder. The product was then tested for stability in electric furnace at 10000 C. The project thus highlighted some possibilities of production of local refractory binding material from locally available raw material...|$|E
40|$|<b>Refractory</b> <b>Mortar</b> is {{a mixture}} of fine {{particles}} which are used {{in the form of a}} paste to bind refractory bricks after the addition of water to the mixture. The composition and chemistry of the mortar need to be similar to that of the brick to be joined by the mortar. The service life of a refractory lining not only depends on the properties bricks but also on joints made by mortar. More precisely to say mortar joints in a refractory walls is the weakest part of the wall. Mortars used to bind the bricks are generally low cost materials as compared to bricks. But its importance is much more than brick. Because it forms the lining between the refractory bricks;if failure occurs,it causes the damage of the whole refractory lining. In the present study,attempts have been made to develop 45 % Al 2 O 3 mortar to join 45 - 50 % alumina bricks with suitable binder. Chinese bauxite,fire clay grog, and sillimanite sand have been used as aggregates to prepare the mortar. Three binders chosen are bentonite, plastic clay and sodium silicate liquid. Attempt has been made to study the effect of binders on the physical and mechanical properties of the mortar thus developed. Analysis has been done by considering all the physical and mechanical properties of the mortar found by using different binders in different percentage. It has been found by using bentonite as a binder that, all the mechanical properties of the mortar increases with increase in bentonite content also with increase in temperature. It is also concluded that by using plastic clay as a binding agent, mechanical also physical behaviour of mortar increases with increase in plastic clay content. By using sodium silicate liquid as a binder all the mechanical properties of the mortar specially bond strength of mortar increases drastically with increase in temperature also with sodium silicate liquid content as compared to other binders studied. Among all binder studied, sodium silicate liquid was found to be better than other...|$|E
40|$|The {{laboratory}} {{immersion test}} system built and operated at ORNL {{was found to}} successfully screen samples from numerous refractory suppliers, including both commercially available and experimental materials. This system was found to provide an accurate prediction of how these materials would perform in the actual gasifier environment. Test materials included mullites, alumino-silicate bricks, fusion-cast aluminas, alumina-based and chrome-containing mortars, phosphate-bonded mortars, coated samples provided under an MPLUS-funded project, bonded spinels, different fusion-cast magnesia-alumina spinels with magnesia content ranging from 2. 5 % to about 60 %, high-MgO castable and brick materials, spinel castables, and alkali-aluminate materials. This testing identified several candidate material systems that perform well in the New Bern gasifier. Fusion-cast aluminas were found to survive for nearly one year, and magnesia-alumina spinels have operated successfully for 18 months {{and are expected to}} survive for two years. Alkali-aluminates and high-MgO-content materials have also been identified for backup lining applications. No other material with a similar structure and chemical composition to that of the fusion-cast magnesium-aluminum spinel brick currently being used for the hot-face lining is commercially available. Other materials used for this application have been found to have inferior service lives, as previously discussed. Further, over 100 laboratory immersion tests have been performed on other materials (both commercial and experimental), but none to date has performed as well as the material currently being used for the hot-face lining. Operating experience accumulated with the high-temperature gasifier at New Bern, North Carolina, has confirmed that the molten alkali salts degrade many types of refractories. Fusion-cast alumina materials were shown to provide a great improvement in lifetime over materials used previously. Further improvement was realized with fusion-cast magnesia-alumina spinel refractory, which appears to be the most resistant to degradation found to date, exhibiting over a year of service life and expected to be capable of over two years of service life. Regarding the use of <b>refractory</b> <b>mortar,</b> it was found that expansion of the current chrome-alumina mortar when subjected to black liquor smelt is likely contributing to the strains seen on the vessel shell. Additionally, the candidate high-alumina mortar that was originally proposed as a replacement for the current chrome-alumina mortar also showed a large amount of expansion when subjected to molten smelt. A UMR experimental mortar, composed of a phosphate bonded system specifically designed for use with fusion-cast magnesium-aluminum spinel, was found to perform well in the molten smelt environment. Strain gauges installed on the gasifier vessel shell provided valuable information about the expansion of the refractory, and a new set of strain gauges and thermocouples has been installed in order to monitor the loading caused by the currently installed spinel refractory. These results provide information for a direct comparison of the expansion of the two refractories. Measurements to date suggest that the fusion-cast magnesia-alumina spinel is expanding less than the fusion-cast {alpha}/{beta}-alumina used previously. A modified liquor nozzle was designed and constructed to test a number of materials that should be more resistant to erosion and corrosion than the material currently used. Inserts made of three erosion-resistant metallic materials were fabricated, along with inserts made of three ceramic materials. The assembled system was sent to the New Bern mill for installation in the gasifer in 2005. Following operation of the gasifier using the modified nozzle, inserts should be removed and analyzed for wear by erosion/corrosion. Although no materials have been directly identified for sensor/thermocouple protection tubes, several of the refractory material systems identified for lining material applications may be applicable for use in this capacity. Results of the modeling studies suggest that the temperature distribution is higher {{at the bottom of the}} gasifier than previously thought. Therefore, it may be possible to reduce the refractory temperature in the gasifier by changing the liquor spray. Also, modeling showed that because of the strong swirl, a separation zone could be formed at the corner of the conical wall where it meets the vertical barrel wall, and some the liquor droplets could be suspended in this zone. The accumulation of droplets in this area could cause instabilities in the performance and also in corrosion of the refractory...|$|E

40|$|With the aim to {{correlate}} the global properties of <b>refractory</b> <b>mortars</b> with the micro-mechanical processes, {{a series of}} uni-axial compression and shear tests was conducted. The test program was developed with {{the view that the}} shear grain slip and cracks are frequent failure mechanism under compressive loads. The micro-structural changes during compression were monitored by X-ray micro focus computed tomography. Discrete element modelling was used to highlight the effects of individual factors of influence. Mortars with a water glass binder of different maturity were tested. In compression the mortars demonstrated cracking and pore closure. Shear tests showed that the failure process consists of multiple local failure events. The combined effects of the porosity and immature binder promote increased tendency for crack branching and arrest. This results in low shear strength and high compressibility. Cohesion and interlocking between the grains prevents crack branching and increases the stiffness and the strength. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{refractory}} {{masonry lining}} of industrial furnaces the compressibility of mortars {{is critical for}} the thermo-mechanical integrity of the structure. Compressive stress-strain behaviour of <b>refractory</b> <b>mortars</b> has been measured during drying at room temperature and in the service temperaturerange of 300 - 1400 â¦C. The results have been explained using fractographic analysis and distinct element method computer modelling. The mortarfailure {{has been shown to}} occur due to formation of shear bands of micro-cracks. The propagation of cracks preferably follows the shortest pathbetween larger pores and is influenced by grain cohesion and interlocking. Tests with mortars featuring calcium aluminate cement, mono aluminiumphosphate, water glass and bentonite clay binders have indicated that besides increasing the cohesion between the grains the binder reduces theinternal friction that promotes higher compressibility. It has been found that the mortar with clay has the highest compressibility. The mortar withcement shows the most stable behaviour...|$|R
