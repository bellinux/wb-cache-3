40|$|The {{important}} role which older people play in rural community development through their various activities {{has become a}} substantive area of interest across social science disciplines, including gerontology, sociology, psychology and human geography. Reflecting the demographic shift of an ageing countryside within {{many parts of the}} global north, the future of <b>rural</b> <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> initiatives will increasingly depend on a nuanced appreciation of the social and voluntary activities undertaken by the growing older population. We seek to expand this focus to consider the social value of these practices for both the individual and the particular communities of which they are a part, and make a case for ?serious leisure theory? (Stebbins 1982) as a potentially rich seam for exploring these relations. This is put into practice through a case study involving the over 60 s residents of a village in rural Wales, and through in-depth interviews we draw attention to their role in securing socio-economic sustainability in the locality through voluntary, hobby-based and amateur pursuits. In conclusion, we consider the analytical merits and limitations of serious leisure theory and, more broadly, the implications of the political fashioning of community-engaged older people as exemplar public citizens in the context of ongoing neoliberal welfare reformsPeer reviewe...|$|E

Politics in the {{countryside}} has undergone a significant shift in emphasis in recent decades, which may be characterized as a transition from ?rural politics? to ?a politics of the rural?. Whereas ?rural politics? refers broadly to politics located in rural space, or relating to ?rural issues?, the ?politics of the rural? {{is defined by the}} centrality of the meaning and regulation of rurality itself as the primary focus of conflict and debate. However, far from marginalizing social issues ? as early work on the new rural conflicts by Mormont implied ? the paper argues that the new politics of the rural has liberated <b>rural</b> <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> from the shadow of agricultural policy, providing a new language and context through which rural social issues can be placed on the political agenda. Three examples of this are discussed, drawing on illustrations from Britain, Australia, New Zealand and North America ? conflicts over the rationalization of public and commercial services in rural communities; campaigns around the closure of rural schools and their symbolic place at the heart of rural communities; and issues of difference and discrimination {{in the countryside}}, including responses to travellers and asylum-seekers.

40|$|High {{mortality}} {{conditioned by}} both endogenous and exogenous causes {{is one of}} the challenges of today that will restrict the development of Russian regions and modernization of the economy. The paper presents the results of a multidimensional typological analysis of the subjects of the Russian Federation according to rural cause-of-death patterns. The role and influence of the social factors reducing mortality in different typological groups of Russian regions are examined. The need to apply a regionally differentiated approach in <b>rural</b> mortality reducing <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> is explained. It is shown in the paper that mortality rates and patterns are important indicators of public health mirroring the attitude of the state towards its citizens, {{the quality of life of}} the population, the values and social attitudes of different population strata, the rate of development of public health services, the availability of hi-tech medical services, the dominant stereotypes of social behavior and the spiritual condition of the society. Mortality rates and patterns both have social grounds: they alter as the society changes, influenced by these changes, and in turn affect the direction, rates and nature of these transformations. Interregional differences in mortality rates and cause-of-death patterns are to a large extent determined by the social conditions in which people live and work. It is explained why <b>social</b> and demographic <b>policies</b> should be integrated to reduce mortality in Russian regions. The regression equations run in this study are evaluated by using the data presented by the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) in open access on its website. As a result of this study, the most important rural mortality reducing factors are singled out that cannot be ignored when drawing up regional strategies of <b>rural</b> <b>social</b> development and regional health-care modernization plans.

These policies are discussed in historical context {{with a focus on}} how they responded to social, economic, and cultural changes at each stage. Assessment and analysis of these policies and their implications are provided by the author. Key words: China, rural policy, history China in the 20 th century saw a number of drastic changes. Politically, the nation moved from a feudal monarchy to a republic and then to a socialist regime; economically, the country reformed its peasant-based rural economy and is shifting toward a market economy; culturally, the Confucian heritage survived numerous challenges. This study aims to provide an overview of China’s rural development in the 20 th century with a focus on rural policy and its influence. Before 1949 Before the 20 th Century Before the 20 th Century, rural China was dominated by household-based small-scale production. Due to a long tradition of laissez-faire economics which discouraged commerce, farming as a career was regarded productive, decent, and honest, while commercial occupations were deemed nonproductive and suspect.

40|$|This {{work does}} not ask why poverty persisted in Indianola {{and other places}} in the rural south, but how [...] despite all the {{obstacles}} of state, society and market [...] the impoverished emerged from and exited poverty with civic assets as well as religious ones. The interdependency and citizenship pathways between families and the state and the pathways of aspiring agrarian capitalists led to a chronic and latent dysfunction [...] an inadequate protection of the welfare of all persons, especially the rural poor and black persons. This dysfunction was sustained, for much of the century gone-by, by political reciprocity among United States presidents, southern white congressmen, federal district court judges, local southern elites and vigilantes, and their northern congressional counterparts. Dysfunctional state action fostered a racially-based and insidious poverty and illiteracy [...] a system of servitude. Servitude is thus central to our understanding of how to unpack exits and understand pathways to full economic and political citizenship. I examined the lives of eight of the oldest families I could find in Sunflower County in {{the last decade of the}} twentieth century. Other than being elderly, I looked for families with some landowning status. These families ranged from fifty year sharecroppers who as women, girls, men and boys were subjected to violence and the insults that come with second-class citizenship. The families in this study were sharecroppers, mule renters, black farmers, stay-home mothers, welfare-recipients, college graduates, primary and high school "incompleters," community activists and the powerful. How did they exit poverty? It was not the <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> prescriptions or <b>social</b> provisions of the early and mid-twentieth century that empowered the black rural poor, it was their collective refusal to see themselves as victims, their opportunities to own land, rear children, and their fierce will to sacrifice and function well as kinship families and religious communities that propelled exits from rural poverty in Mississippi and the Deep South.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To examine factors {{associated}} with social participation and their relationship with self-perceived well-being in older adults. METHODS This study was based on data obtained from the National Socioeconomic Characterization (CASEN) Survey conducted in Chile, in 2011, on a probability sample of households. We examined information of 31, 428 older adults living in these households. Descriptive and explanatory analyses were performed using linear and multivariate logistic regression models. We assessed the respondents&# 8217; participation in different types of associations: egotropic, sociotropic, and religious. RESULTS Social participation increased with advancing age and then declined {{after the age of}} 80. The main finding of this study was that family social capital is a major determinant of social participation of older adults. Their involvement was associated with high levels of self-perceived subjective well-being. We identified four settings as sources of <b>social</b> participation: home-based; <b>rural</b> community-based; <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> programs; and religious. Older adults {{were significantly more likely to}} participate when other members of the household were also involved in social activities evidencing an intergenerational transmission of <b>social</b> participation. <b>Rural</b> communities, especially territorial associations, were the most favorable setting for participation. There has been a steady increase in the rates of involvement of older adults in social groups in Chile, especially after retirement. Religiosity remains a major determinant of associativism. The proportion of participation was higher among older women than men but these proportions equaled after the age of 80. CONCLUSIONS Self-perceived subjective well-being is not only dependent upon objective factors such as health and income, but is also dependent upon active participation in social life, measured as participation in associations, though its effects are moderate...|$|R

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>policies</b> play a {{critical}} role in the transformation of emerging economies. This paper discusses this with reference to China and India, with their very distinctive public policy approaches. Much of the economics literature either does not pay much attention to <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> or regards it as secondary at best or as a market enemy at worst. Views on <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> in emerging economies see this as either lagging or threatening growth. Instead, this paper argues, <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> is congruent and constitutive, and sustainable <b>social</b> <b>policies</b> are those that are formulated as part of economic policies and transformation, and, in turn, shape the conditions of enhancing markets and productivity. The paper describes how the 'great transformation' of both countries shapes <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> responses, the institutions and ideas that give very different shapes to the two countries' policies and the way policies vis- 0 -vis minorities are situated in both countries' <b>social</b> <b>policies.</b> The conclusion argues for the distinct research agenda that follows from this conceptualisation of <b>social</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|R

Much of the devolved powers available to the governments in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff centre on <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> innovation and practice. Devolution was widely welcomed as opening up the potential for the development of radically different <b>social</b> <b>policies.</b> However, the discussion of devolution has been largely dominated by an approach that focuses on institutional and/or organizational differences marginalizing, in the process, the wider social relations of welfare around which <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> is organized. In bringing the study of devolution into the heartland of <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> analysis, it is argued that we can begin to develop a more critically informed appreciation of <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> across the entire devolved UK. Through critical <b>social</b> <b>policy</b> analysis we can both evaluate and explain the complex interrelations between devolved governance and the continuing reproduction of inequalities and social divisions throughout the UK...|$|R
