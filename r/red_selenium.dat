30|$|It {{suggests}} that elimination of excess selenium via SeMet and MetSeCys biosynthesis {{is not the}} sole way of detoxification {{in the case of}} high selenium concentration. As mentioned above, in high selenium concentrations, the excess selenium is also eliminated via its reduction to elemental <b>red</b> <b>selenium</b> (Turło et al. 2010; Tsivileva et al. 2012). It can be assumed that, as in plants, incorporation of selenomethionine into the structures of mushroom proteins likely contributes to selenium toxicity: mycelial growth was significantly reduced (p <  0.0005) when the concentration of selenomethionine in the mycelia was > 300  µg/g of dry mass. This effect was accompanied by a nearly twofold increase in the concentration of Se-methyl-seleno-l-cysteine (Table  1).

Fifteen sheep were randomly allocated into three groups. Groups 1 and 2 received selenium nanoparticles orally at 1 mg/kg and sodium selenite at 1 mg Se/kg for 10 consecutive days; group 3 served as the control. To assess the degrees of oxidative stress and of lipid peroxidation of the cellular membranes, the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were determined in serum samples that were collected at different supplementation intervals, i. e., after 0, 10, 20, and 30 days.

The spent medium (culture supernatant) contains {{the potential of}} reducing soluble and colorless SeO 3 (2 -) to insoluble <b>red</b> elemental <b>selenium</b> (Se(0)) at 37 °C. Characterization of red Se° product by use of UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) analysis revealed the presence of stable, predominantly monodispersed and spherical selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) of an average size of 21 nm. Most likely, the metabolite phenazine- 1 -carboxylic acid (PCA) released by strain JS- 11 in culture supernatant along with the known redox agents like NADH and NADH dependent reductases are responsible for biomimetic reduction of SeO 3 (2 -) to Se° nanospheres.

These metal-microbe interactions have already found {{an important role in}} biotechnological applications. It is only recently that microorganisms have been explored as potential biofactories for synthesis of metal/metalloid nanoparticles. Biosynthesis of selenium (Se 0) nanospheres in aerobic conditions by a bacterial strain isolated from the coalmine soil is reported in the present study. Results The strain CM 100 B, identified as Bacillus cereus by morphological, biochemical and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing [GenBank: GU 551935. 1] was studied for its ability to generate selenium nanoparticles (SNs) by transformation of toxic selenite (SeO 3 2 -) anions into <b>red</b> elemental <b>selenium</b> (Se 0) under aerobic conditions. Also, the ability of the strain to tolerate high levels of toxic selenite ions was studied by challenging the microbe with different concentrations of sodium selenite (0. 5 mM- 10 mM). ESEM, AFM and SEM studies revealed the spherical Se 0 nanospheres adhering to bacterial biomass as well as present as free particles. The TEM microscopy showed the accumulation of spherical nanostructures as intracellular and extracellular deposits. The deposits were identified as element selenium by EDX analysis. This is also indicated by the red coloration of the culture broth that starts within 2 - 3 h of exposure to selenite oxyions. Selenium nanoparticles (SNs) were further characterized by UV-Visible spectroscopy, TEM and zeta potential measurement. The size of nanospheres was in the range of 150 - 200 nm with high negative charge of - 46. 86 mV.

For this study, the extracted alkaline-solution (pH = 12. 2 - 12. 4 and Ca concentration = 810 - 870 mg/L) from alkaline solid waste was placed in contact with compressed or supercritical CO 2 at moderate or high temperature, leading a preferential nucleation-growth of submicrometric particles of calcite (< 1 μm) with rhombohedral morphology at 90 °C and 90 bar (9 MPa), whereas a preferential nucleation-growth of nanometric particles of calcite (< 0. 2 μm) with scalenohedral morphology at 30 °C and 20 bar (2 MPa) were observed.

40|$|Background: Rhizobium sullae HCNT 1 {{does not}} obtain any obvious {{benefits}} from its truncated denitrification chain, {{so that the}} conservation of the unique gene of denitrification that encodes for a dissimilatory nitrite reductase is apparently inexplicable. Recently, a defence mechanism for detoxification of selenite was proposed. Objectives: Investigation on the possible meaning of nirK gene in Rhizobium sullae and in depth examination {{on the nature of}} the encoded enzyme. Methods: Physiological responses to the presence of selenite was determined by growth in liquid and solid medium, by gaschromatograph analyses and scanning electron microscopy. Molecular investigation were carried out by RT-PCR and SDSPAGE analyses. Results: 1. Selenite reduction activity occurred either under aerobic or anaerobic atmosphere, while the reduction of nitrite to NO can be attained only after a preincubation under microaerobic conditions. 2. The presence of nitrite in the cultural medium together with selenite did not influence selenite reduction to elemental <b>red</b> <b>selenium.</b> On the contrary, the addition of selenite to cultures containing nitrite inhibits the production of nitrogen oxides. 3. The presence of selenite has no effect on the expression level of nirK: cDNA analysis confirmed that nirK is always expressed, as the transcript is present either during aerobic or under microaerophilic conditions. 4. A recombinant-proteins approach (His-tag) allowed to purify a subunit of about 40 kDa encoded by nirK gene, that is a subunit which form the overall architecture of the homotrimeric enzyme (120 kDa).

40|$|Background: Different {{bacteria}} {{have been}} reported so far that link selenite resistance {{to the production of}} metallic selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs). Although SeNPs have many biotechnological applications in diverse areas, the molecular mechanisms involved in their microbial genesis are not fully understood. The Azoarcus genus is a physiologically versatile group of beta-proteobacteria of great environmental relevance. Azoarcus sp. CIB is a facultative anaerobe that combines the ability to degrade under aerobic and/or anaerobic conditions a wide range of aromatic compounds, including some toxic hydrocarbons such as toluene and m-xylene, with an endophytic life style in the root of rice. We unravel here an additional physiological feature of the strain CIB that is related to its resistance to selenium oxyanions and the formation of SeNPs. Results: This work is the first report of a member of the Azoarcus genus that is able to anaerobically grow in the presence of selenite. Electron microscopy preparations and X-ray spectroscopy analyses demonstrate the reduction of selenite to spherical electron-dense SeNPs whose average size was 123 ± 35 nm of diameter. Our data suggest that the main molecular mechanism of selenite resistance resides on an energy-dependent selenite exporter. Azoarcus cells trigger the synthesis of SeNPs when they reach the stationary-phase of growth, and either the exhaustion of electron donor or acceptor, both of which lead to starvation conditions, produce the reduction of selenite to <b>red</b> elemental <b>selenium.</b> Azoarcus becomes a promising biocatalyst, either as whole cells or cellular extracts, for the anaerobic and/or aerobic green synthesis of SeNPs.

Since Azoarcus is also able to degrade both aerobically and anaerobically toxic aromatic compounds of great environmental concern, it becomes a suitable candidate for a more sustainable agricultural practice and for bioremediation strategies...|$|R

For <b>selenium,</b> differences between <b>red</b> deer and wild boar were statistically significant (p 0. 001 for red deer and r= 0. 567, p= 0. 005 for wild boar). Liver GSSG concentrations were negatively correlated to total mercury and Hg:Se molar ratio in male deer, which could indicate a hormetic response to Hg exposure. Moreover, a positive association {{was found between the}} antioxidant element Se and antioxidant vitamins in red deer tissues. M. J. Patiño Ropero and J.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a series of}} observational studies that {{examine the relationship between}} the systemic inflammatory response, glucose, micronutrients concentrations and outcomes in patients with critical illness with reference to a large nutrition screen cohort. Data and stored samples were available from cohorts which had been defined previously. The critical illness cohort comprised of medical or surgical patients ≥ 18 years admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI) between September 2006 and December 2008. The nutrition screen cohort comprised samples and associated information which had been processed by the Pathological Biochemistry Department of the GRI. The samples had been received for vitamin and / or trace element assessment of patients from both GRI and other Scottish hospitals between January 2006 and March 2013. Samples had been referred to the lab for analysis of a number of variables related to nutrition, including glucose, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), lutein, lycopene, vitamins A, B 1, B 2, B 6, C, D and E, and zinc, selenium, copper, and manganese. Data was not available for all variables for all samples, hence studies varied in the number of observations. plasma glucose was measured in sodium floride blood sample whole-blood samples underwent for routine analysis of concentrations of lutein, lycopene, α-carotene and β-carotene, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), α-tocopherol (vitamin E) in plasma, zinc, selenium, copper, B 1, B 2, B 6 in plasma and red cells. In Chapter 2 the relationship between glucose and markers of the systemic inflammatory response was examined in detail in patients from the critical illness cohort (n= 100). The results of this study showed that plasma glucose concentration - even within the context of tight insulin protocol - was influenced by many factors. Surgical and medical patients differed in their requirements for insulin; medical patients have higher plasma glucose and insulin administration accordingly compared with surgical patients. However, catecholamine and steroid administration were also associated with higher insulin requirements. In Chapter 3 the relationship between plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and related arginine metabolism (homoarginine, arginine, symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA)) and outcome was examined in patients from critical illness cohort (n= 104). Patients with critical illness experience metabolic disorders including catabolism and hyperglycaemia and these were associated with poor outcome. Plasma ADMA and SDMA concentrations were higher in patients with critical illness and were also associated with disease severity and mortality. In contrast, plasma homoarginine concentrations were lower in patients with critical illness and were also associated with disease severity and mortality. These results suggest that ADMA metabolism is perturbed with likely knock on effects on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and endothelial function. There is a need for further work on in vivo dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) activity in critical illness and the effect of critical illness on the cationic amino acid transporters (CAT) -mediated exchange of ADMA between intra and extra-cellular compartments. It was proposed that ADMA and SDMA may not only be indicators of the severity of illness and may even contribute to adverse events in patients with critical illness. In Chapter 4 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by CRP and albumin, and mortality, in patients from critical illness cohort (n= 261) was examined. In this cohort, the combination of CRP and albumin predicted ICU and hospital mortality as effectively as APACHE II. In Chapter 5 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and plasma glucose was examined in a nutrition screen cohort (n= 5248). The results of this study showed that plasma concentrations of glucose were independently positive and negative associated with both CRP and albumin respectively, and were consistent with the systemic inflammatory response as having an impact on glucose concentrations. However, such relationships were not apparent in patients with critical illness (n= 116). It was concluded that plasma concentrations of glucose were independently associated with both CRP and albumin, and were consistent with the systemic inflammatory response as a determinant of its concentrations. In Chapter 6 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and plasma concentrations of carotenoids was examined in a nutrition screen cohort (n= 1074). The results of this study showed that the clinical interpretation of plasma carotenoids requires knowledge of the magnitude of the systemic inflammatory response, even after adjustment for cholesterol. It was concluded that a reliable clinical interpretation can be made only for plasma lutein, lycopene and β-carotene if the CRP is less than 20 mg/L. In Chapter 7 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and plasma 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) was examined in a nutrition screen cohort (n= 5327, and in patients from critical illness cohort n= 117). The results of this study showed that plasma concentrations of 25 (OH) D were independently associated with both CRP and albumin. It was concluded that the systemic inflammatory response was a major confounding factor in determining vitamin D status. In Chapter 8 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and plasma vitamin E (α-tocopherol) and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) was examined in a nutrition screen cohort (n= 359, n= 494 respectively and in patients from critical illness cohort n= 82). The results of this study showed that α-tocopherol/ cholesterol ratio and ascorbic acid were independently associated with both CRP and albumin. It was concluded that the systemic inflammatory response was a major confounding factor in determining vitamin E and C status. In Chapter 9 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and plasma zinc, selenium was examined in a nutrition screen cohort (n= 743, n= 833, respectively and in patients from the critical illness cohort n= 114). The results of this study showed that plasma concentrations of zinc were associated with both CRP and albumin. However, the impact of the systemic inflammatory response (as evidenced by elevation of CRP concentrations) on plasma zinc concentrations could be largely adjusted by albumin concentrations. Plasma concentrations of selenium were associated with both CRP and albumin. However, the impact of the systemic inflammatory response on plasma selenium concentrations could not be reasonably adjusted by albumin concentrations. It was concluded that plasma zinc and selenium concentrations were independently associations with CRP and albumin as markers of systemic inflammatory response. In Chapter 10 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and <b>red</b> cell zinc, <b>selenium</b> and copper was examined in patients from critical illness cohort (n= 125). The results of this study showed that altered red cell concentrations of zinc, selenium and copper were likely to be more reliable measures of status {{in the presence of a}} systemic inflammatory response. In Chapter 11 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and red cell vitamins B 1, B 2 and B 6 was examined in nutrition screen cohort (n= 553, n= 251, n= 313, respectively and in patients from critical illness cohort n= 94). The results of this study showed that in contrast to plasma concentrations of B 1, B 2 and B 6, red cell concentrations do not fall as a part of the systemic inflammatory response. It was concluded that red cell concentrations of B 1, B 2 and B 6 were likely to be more reliable measures of status in the presence of a systemic inflammatory response. In summary, studies in the present thesis showed that, during the systemic inflammatory response, plasma concentration of glucose had multiple determinants other than insulin. Furthermore, in the presence of systemic inflammatory response, plasma lutein, lycopene, α-carotene and β-carotene, 25 (OH) D, C, E, zinc, selenium, and copper were unreliable, and that intracellular micronutrients concentrations such as <b>red</b> cell zinc, <b>selenium,</b> copper, B 1, B 2 and B 6, were more reliable as indicators of vitamin and trace element status in patients subject to nutrition screen and in patients with critical illness. These results have implications for the assessment of glucose and micronutrient status in the general population and for treatment in patients with critical illness...|$|R
40|$|Rhizobium sullae, a {{nitrogen}} fixing symbiotic bacterium, induces nodule formation on Hedysarum coronarium (Casella et al., 1984; Squartini et al., 2002). R. sullae strain HCNT 1 {{is known}} to possess a truncated denitrification chain, harbouring only a gene (nirK) that encodes for a dissimilatory nitrite reductase (Toffanin et al., 1996). Since this strain does not obtain any obvious benefits from it, the conservation of this gene is currently unexplained. R. sullae HCNT 1 was recently found able to grow on high concentrations of selenite and to reduce this oxyanion to the less toxic elemental selenium. Since its nirK-minus mutant grows weakly {{in the presence of}} even low selenite and it is not able to grow at higher concentrations, a defence mechanism for detoxification of selenite was proposed to explain one of the potential roles of nirK (Basaglia et al., 2007). Nitrite reductase activity of R. sullae was then evaluated in different environmental conditions, in the presence of nitrite, selenite or both. In this approach it was possible to clarify if nitrite reductase and selenite reductase are, in this strain, the same protein that works in different way, according to the substrate and to the atmospheric conditions, or they are two distinct proteins. Firstly, it was observed that selenite reduction activity occurred either under aerobic or anaerobic atmosphere, while the reduction of nitrite to NO can be attained only after a microaerobic preincubation, and that the presence of nitrite in the cultural medium together with selenite did not influence selenite reduction to elemental <b>red</b> <b>selenium.</b> On the contrary, the addition of selenite to cultures containing nitrite inhibits the production of nitrogen oxides. The presence of selenite has no effect on the expression level of nirK; mRNA analysis confirmed that nirK is always expressed, as the related transcript is present either during aerobic or under microaerophilic conditions. Moreover, the use in the culture of a specific chelator for a copper-containing nitrite reductase such as NirK, together with selenite, inhibited also the reduction of this oxyanion to elemental red form. This latest result indicates that the putative selenite reductase in R. sullae contains copper, like nitrite reductase. The above evidences seem to suggest that nitrite and selenite reductase could be the same protein; the enzyme studied could be a selenite reductase, rather than a nitrite reductase, which reduce selenite under aerobic condition and that becomes able to reduce also nitrite but only after a treatment under microaerobic condition. Therefore, protein purification was essential to better understand its properties. A recombinant-proteins approach (His-tag) allowed to purify a subunit of about 40 kDa encoded by nirK gene, that is a subunit which form the overall architecture of the homotrimeric enzyme (120 kDa). Preliminary in vitro experiments with the purified protein, for testing its ability to reduce nitrite and selenite separately, were undertaken. Although NirK showed the ability to reduce nitrite, medium-long term experiments are required to obtain the optimal conditions under which the protein could also reduce selenite...|$|E
