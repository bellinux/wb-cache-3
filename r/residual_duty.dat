40|$|The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) granted {{significant}} {{access to}} fisheries resources to coastal States in their exclusive economic zones (EEZ), including tuna. As tuna {{is a highly}} migratory species, international law requires that States cooperate for the effective management of tuna stocks. The Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UN Fish Stocks Agreement) provides the framework by which such cooperation is to be achieved. The coastal and Island States of the Indian Ocean including Kenya, achieve the cooperative management of tuna through the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC). As a beneficiary of the EEZ regime, Kenya has declared sovereign rights over the fisheries resources in its EEZ. In recent years, because of the potential of the tuna resources in its EEZ, Kenya has expressed its aspirations to develop these resources. Kenya’s sovereign rights over the tuna resources in its EEZ are subject to relevant rules of international law. The LOSC confers upon Kenya management and conservation responsibilities as well as the <b>residual</b> <b>duty</b> to promote the optimum utilisation of its tuna resources. The significance of Kenya’s regulatory regime for conserving and managing tuna resources in its EEZ is exemplified by the LOSC and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. This thesis analyses Kenya’s legal and policy framework relative to the management and conservation of the tuna resources in Kenya’s jurisdiction, to ascertain the consistency of this framework with the international and regional legal requirements. This will require an examination of the relevant international and regional legal requirements relative to the utilization of tuna and an analysis {{of the extent to which}} Kenya has met its international and regional commitments. Ultimately, this thesis argues that Kenya has not fully adopted measures consistent with its international and regional obligations for the sustainable utilization of tuna, and that Kenya’s current legal and policy framework does not adequately address the long-term sustainability of its tuna resources. This thesis will aid in the construction of recommendations for the review and reform of Kenya’s legal and policy framework. These recommendations will include the formulation of a tuna management plan calculated to enhance the management of, and benefits derived from Kenya’s tuna fisheries. This thesis explores various options for the optimum utilisation of Kenya’s tuna resources, with a view to fostering the sustainable development of Kenya’s tuna fisheries. In developing an appropriate framework for the sustainable development of its tuna resources, Kenya will necessarily require provisions and commitments that ensure the effective management and conservation of the tuna resources in its EEZ...|$|E
40|$|The Responsibility to Protect (RtoP) is an {{interdisciplinary}} normative framework that reconceptualises state sovereignty as a responsibility {{rather than a}} right. It obliges states to protect their people from humanitarian catastrophe, and {{in the event of}} state failure or unwillingness to heed this responsibility, requires of the broader international community to assume the <b>residual</b> <b>duty</b> to protect. When the principles of RtoP were endorsed by world leaders at the United Nations’ 2005 World Summit, it seemed as though the normative regime was gaining currency in international relations. However, the operationalization of RtoP continued to be dogged by controversy and conceptual ambiguity. This prompted UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon in January 2009 to appeal to the international community to strengthen the “doctrinal, policy and institutional life” of the norm. This study responds to Ban’s call and seeks to complement efforts of scholars across the world to refine the conceptual parameters of RtoP. Two African case studies of humanitarian crisis during {{the first decade of the}} 21 st Century, respectively Darfur and Zimbabwe, are analysed. In both cases there is ample evidence that the governments in question defaulted on their sovereign responsibilities, thus necessitating RtoP-guided action by the international community. Based on an inventory of responses to the two crises by non-state, individual state and broader intergovernmental entities, the study finds that the behaviour of these actors complied at different times and to varying extents with the triadic RtoP sub-responsibilities of prevention, response and rebuilding. A specific analytical instrument – the RtoP ‘Tool Box’ developed by Gareth Evans in 2008 (and expanded on in 2013 by the International Coalition of the Responsibility to Protect) – is applied to derive at summative conclusions about the appropriateness of specific responses in each of the three RtoP sub-responsibilities. A salient finding is the extent to which politicization of RtoP undermines its operationalization. From lack of political will to implement decisions or to respond to early warning of looming catastrophe; to real or perceived agendas that mask the agendas of intervening entities, the RtoP debate is continuously subject to a political narrative. This is evidenced by the fact that neither Darfur nor Zimbabwe has seen timeous or effective responses to humanitarian crises that were induced by their own governments. As has become evident in the decade since the World Summit endorsed RtoP, there is no global consensus yet on the norm. This is glaringly evident in terms of its implementation (or lack thereof). However, based on analysis of the two cases studies the study highlights the extent to which the norm has guided responses by a wide spectrum of actors. RtoP principles have become an indelible part of the discourse on humanitarian intervention, both when the norm is invoked explicitly (the case of Darfur) and when major actors downplay its invocation (the case of Zimbabwe). The impact of the norm is thus diminished by the international community’s piecemeal, ad hoc, and uncoordinated application thereof. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.

Even in freedom, the ex-slave could be bound to some continuing duty to the master and were commonly required to live nearby the former master (paramone). Breaches of these conditions could lead to beatings, prosecution at law and re-enslavement. Sometimes extra payments were specified by which a freed slave could liberate himself from these <b>residual</b> <b>duties.</b> But ex-slaves were able to own property outright, and their children were free of all constraint.|$|R
40|$|Many {{believe that}} duties {{should be at}} the essence of citizenship. This paper dismisses this view, using EU law as the main context of analysis, by making five interrelated claims. (1) There are no empirically {{observable}} duties of EU citizenship; (2) such duties would lack any legal-theoretical foundation, if the contrary were true; (3) legal-theoretical foundations of the duties of citizenship are lacking also at the Member State level; (4) EU law {{plays an important role in}} undermining the ability of the Member States where <b>residual</b> <b>duties</b> remain to enforce them; (5) this development is part of a greater EU input into the strengthening of democracy, the rule of law and human rights in the Member States and reflects a general trend of de-dutification of citizenship around the democratic world. If these conclusions are correct, it is time to stop categorising EU citizenship duties among the desiderata of EU law...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether and}} how reforms in corporate governance structures and practices in the United States may reshape conventional notions of the fiduciary duties owed by independent directors of public companies. The paper identifies two focal points {{for the evolution of}} directors 2 ̆ 7 fiduciary duties. First, various reforms in corporate governance assign more specific responsibilities to directors, arguably reorienting directors 2 ̆ 7 loyalty to due discharge of a specified function along with ongoing or <b>residual</b> <b>duties</b> of loyalty owed in more general terms to the corporation and its shareholders. The relationships among these specific duties and more general ones may be complex, as may be the consequences of increased emphasis on work to be done by directors as members of committees in contrast to the board as a whole. Second, reforms in corporate governance imply that a director 2 ̆ 7 s duty of loyalty to the corporation and its shareholders requires more than disinterest, narrowly defined. That is, a director 2 ̆ 7 s duty is one of fidelity to the interests of the corporation that imposes more than an obligation to refrain from participating in board decisions in which the director has a material financial interest. The paper prefaces discussion of evolution of directors 2 ̆ 7 duties by addressing two more fundamental questions about contemporary corporate governance: what role precisely should be assigned to directors, distinct from a corporation 2 ̆ 7 s officers and its other senior executives? And what implications follow for the powers of shareholders? To the extent that directors can reasonably be expected to serve only a relatively formal or vestigial function, an expansion in shareholders 2 ̆ 7 powers may be warranted. Overall, the paper is a study of interrelationships among legal and nonlegal mechanisms that shape expectations for directors 2 ̆ 7 conduct. Although distinct, none operates in a vacuum. Formal structures, definitions, and requirements may shape how directors discharge their responsibilities by focusing directors 2 ̆ 7 attention on their gravity and, by enabling independent directors to function more collegially, facilitating the development of institutions of corporate governance that function independently of senior management. Articulating the content of directors 2 ̆ 7 responsibilities with greater specificity heightens expectations that these responsibilities will be fulfilled. In turn, higher expectations for directors 2 ̆ 7 conduct may serve to legitimate directors 2 ̆ 7 capacity, once elected, to exercise discretion independent of intervention from shareholders...|$|R
30|$|Secondly, a cross-layer design optimal {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} {{to optimize the}} delay of network and energy efficiency for IWSNs. RDML scheme first selects the optimized duty cycle for each node to maximize the energy efficiency of the data transmission. Then, according to nodes in the network at different locations, the energy consumption of nodes is unbalanced. Greater duty cycle for nodes with residual energy is needed to improve data transfer reliability and reduce delay. Because the node has <b>residual</b> energy, the <b>duty</b> cycle is not to minimize the energy consumption of the sending unit bit at this time. Therefore, increasing the node duty cycle, although more energy is consumed and no effect on network lifetime, can effectively {{reduce the number of}} data retransmissions, which can effectively reduce the delay.|$|R
