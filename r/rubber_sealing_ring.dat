50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are press fitted on the axle journal by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 °C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller bearing, an axle collar is press fitted. The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the axle box is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the axle box housing does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a retaining ring is placed. The retaining ring is made of steel and is a press fit. The retaining ring ensures that the rear cover assembly is secured tightly between the axle collar and the retaining ring and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the collar and the bearings were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the axle. The axle box housing, which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is housed in the axle box housing. Axle box grease is filled in the axle box housing. Each axle box housing is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the axle box is placed on a housing which closes the axle box. The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|E

The biomimetic ring has three concave ridges and convex bulges on each side which are very similar to earthworms. Bulges were circularly designed and sealing performances of the biomimetic ring in both static seal and dynamic seal were simulated by FEM. In addition, effects of precompression, medium pressure, speed, friction coefficient, and material parameters on sealing performances were discussed.

The maximum von Mises stress appears on the second bulge of the inner side. High contact stress concentrates on left bulges. Von Mises stress distribution becomes uneven under medium pressure.

In order to study the important degree of every key environmental factor in downhole influencing the sealing performance of rubber sealing material, a new device of simulating downhole environment is designed to test the permeability of O-ring. The sample is hydrogenated nitrile O-ring and orthogonal experiment method is used to do nine tests by getting three levels from temperature, pressure and CO 2 volume fraction. Test adopts fuzzy orthogonal method to analyze the main effects and the interaction between two factors, taking tensile strength, diameter variety rate and pH value of indicator as evaluation index. The results show that: the environmental factor influencing the sealing performance of hydrogenated nitrile O-ring from high to low by turns is temperature, pressure and CO 2 volume fraction, while the interaction between temperature and pressure is the most significant. It provides a new way to study the influence of downhole complex environment on the performance of rubber sealing material.

40|$|This thesis {{treats the}} {{development}} of packaging and integration methods for the cost-efficient encapsulation and packaging of microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices. The packaging of MEMS devices is often more costly than the device itself, partly because the packaging can be crucial {{for the performance of}} the device. For devices which contain liquids or needs to be enclosed in a vacuum, the packaging can account for up to 80 % of the total cost of the device. The first part of this thesis presents the integration scheme for an optical dye thin film NO 2 -gas sensor, designed using cost-efficient implementations of wafer-scale methods. This work includes design and fabrication of photonic subcomponents in addition to the main effort of integration and packaging of the dye-film. A specific proof of concept target was for NO 2 monitoring in a car tunnel. The second part of this thesis deals with the wafer-scale packaging methods developed for the sensing device. The developed packaging method, based on low-temperature plastic deformation of gold sealing structures, is further demonstrated as a generic method for other hermetic liquid and vacuum packaging applications. In the developed packaging methods, the mechanically squeezed gold sealing material is both electroplated microstruc- tures and wire bonded stud bumps. The electroplated rings act like a more hermetic version of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>rings</b> while compressed in conjunction with a cavity forming wafer bonding process. The stud bump sealing processes is on the other hand applied on completed cavities with narrow access ports, to seal either a vacuum or liquid inside the cavities at room temperature. Additionally, the resulting hermeticity of primarily the vacuum sealing methods is thoroughly investigated. Two of the sealing methods presented require permanent mechanical fixation in order to complete the packaging process. Two solutions to this problem are presented in this thesis. First, a more traditional wafer bonding method using tin-soldering is demonstrated. Second, a novel full-wafer epoxy underfill-process using a microfluidic distribution network is demonstrated using a room temperature process. QC 20130325 </p...|$|R

Surface morphology of ring was observed by optical microscopy through metallographic analysis. There is a lot of precipitation in the grain boundaries of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring,</b> along with smaller grain size than the new <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> To explore the composition of precipitation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were used. The results indicated that the concentration of titanium (Ti) and molybdenum (Mo) was higher in the precipitation of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> At the same time, the hardness and elastic modulus of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> were reduced, measured by nanoindentation test. In-situ SEM tensile testing were used to record and analyze the generation of crack source and crack development under applied load. The reasons of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure can be answered because of these experimental results at both macroscopic and microscopic scales. The main reason of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure is a combination of long-term stress and elevated temperature during turbine operation.

40|$|Pressure-energized <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> {{intended}} to withstand flows better than do conventional pressure-energized <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> have been conceived. The concept applies, more specifically, to <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> used on some valve stems, pistons, and the like. A conventional pressure-energized <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> generally has a U-shaped cross section {{and consists of}} an elastomer or other suitable polymer with an embedded metal energizing spring (see Figure 1). The working fluid from the high-pressure side that one seeks to seal is allowed into the U-shaped cavity, so that the pressure pushes {{the sides of the}} <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> tighter against the gland and body sealing surfaces, thereby increasing the degree of sealing. Unfortunately, when the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> is exposed to flow of the working fluid, under some conditions, the flow grabs the lip of the U-shaped cross section and ejects or deforms the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> so that, thereafter, a proper seal is not obtained. Figure 2 depicts one of several alternative <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> according to the present concept. One element of the concept is to modify the U-shaped cross section from that of the corresponding conventional <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> to eliminate the exposed lip and prevent entry of the working fluid into the U-shaped cavity. Unlike in the conventional seal, pressurized fluid would not push the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> directly against the both gland and body sealing surfaces. Instead, the pressure would directly push the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> against a gland sealing surface only. In so doing, the pressure would squash the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> into a smaller volume bounded by the gland and body sealing surfaces, and would thereby indirectly press the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> more tightly against the body sealing surface. To enhance the desired squashing deformation, a spring having an approximately parallelogram cross section would be embedded in the modified U-shaped cavity. As the pressure pushed two corners of the approximate parallelogram closer together along the axis of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring,</b> the other two corners of the approximate parallelogram would be pushed farther apart along a radius of the ring, thereby causing the polymeric ring material to push radially harder against the body sealing surface. From the radially innermost corner of the approximate parallelogram, the spring material would extend radially, then axially into recesses in the seal gland. These extensions would help to restrain the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> against ejection. A seat retainer would hold the <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> in the gland and form a mechanical compression seal to prevent or at least reduce leakage of pressurized fluid into the cavity behind the seal. However, because there would likely be a little leakage, the cavity behind the seal should be vented to the low pressure side to prevent buildup of pressure in the cavity over time; otherwise, the built-up pressure could cause ejection of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> when the pressure on the high-pressure side was reduced. Polymeric seal-ring materials {{may not be able to}} withstand working conditions in applications that involve abrasive and/or hot working fluids. For such applications, all-metal <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> may be preferred.
