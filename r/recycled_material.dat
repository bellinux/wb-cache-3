5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, why are they so heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol and you put in the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E
25|$|The final {{government}} regulation towards increased demand is recycled product labeling. When producers {{are required to}} label their packaging with amount of <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> in the product (including the packaging), consumers {{are better able to}} make educated choices. Consumers with sufficient buying power can then choose more environmentally conscious options, prompt producers {{to increase the amount of}} <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> in their products, and indirectly increase demand. Standardized recycling labeling can also have a positive effect on supply of recyclates if the labeling includes information on how and where the product can be recycled.|$|E

40|$|<b>Recycled</b> <b>materials</b> {{replacing}} part {{of virgin}} materials in highway applications has shown great {{benefits to the}} society and environment. Beneficial use of <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> can save landfill places, sparse natural resources, and energy consumed in milling and hauling virgin materials. Low price of <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> is favorable to cost-saving in pavement projects. Considering the availability of <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> in the State of Maryland (MD), four abundant <b>recycled</b> <b>materials,</b> <b>recycled</b> concrete aggregate (RCA), recycled asphalt pavement (RAP), foundry sand (FS), and dredged materials (DM), were studied. A survey was conducted to collect the information of current usage of the four <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> in States’ Department of Transportation (DOTs). Based on literature review, mechanical and environmental properties, recommendations, and suggested test standards were investigated separately for the four <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> in different applications. Constrains in using these materials were further studied {{in order to provide}} recommendations for the development of related MD specifications. To measure social and environmental benefits from using <b>recycled</b> <b>materials,</b> life-cycle assessment was carried out with life-cycle analysis (LCA) program, PaLATE, and green highway rating system, BEST-in-Highway. The survey results indicated the wide use of RAP and RCA in hot mix asphalt (HMA) and graded aggregate base (GAB) respectively, while FS and DM are less used in field. Environmental concerns are less, but the possibly low quality and some adverse mechanical characteristics may hinder the widely use of these <b>recycled</b> <b>materials.</b> Technical documents and current specifications provided by State DOTs are good references to the usage of these materials in MD. Literature review showed consistent results with the survey. Studies from experimental research or site tests showed satisfactory performance of these materials in highway applications, when the substitution rate, gradation, temperature, moisture, or usage of additives, etc. meet some requirements. The results from LCA revealed significant cost savings in using <b>recycled</b> <b>materials.</b> Energy and water consumption, gas emission, and hazardous waste generation generally showed reductions to some degree. Use of new recycled technologies will contribute to more sustainable highways...|$|R
40|$|<b>Recycled</b> <b>materials</b> are {{increasingly}} being used or considered for mechanical stabilization of abutments and earth slopes associated with transportation facilities. Specifically, recycled plastic lumber, recycled railroad rails, recycled guardrail posts, used railroad ties, “w-beam ” guardrail sections, and even discarded snowplow blades {{have been used in}} a variety of applications. Most of these materials have “virgin ” counterparts of similar form and function that are in relatively common use. The primary task associated with implementing use of these <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> for stabilization of slopes therefore generally lies in adapting or modifying conventional design and construction procedures to account for the different, and sometimes unique and beneficial, properties of the <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> as compared to the virgin materials. Despite the similarities among applications where <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> are used for slope stabilization, the design of stabilization measures using these materials remains rather empirical and a comprehensive philosophy that is suitable for use with the different materials has yet to be established. The objective {{of this paper is to}} summarize current uses of <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> for mechanical stabilization of earth slopes and to elucidate the similarities and differences in characteristics of both the <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> themselves and the applications in which they are used. The experiences of two state departments of transportation demonstrating the potential effectiveness of several types of <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> will be summarized and descriptions of the current limitations and restrictions on the use of each material will be presented. Finally, a number of issues that must be consider when using <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> in slope stabilization applications will be presented based on the results of recent experience and research...|$|R

25|$|One {{approach}} {{to address the}} problem of waste PVC is also through the process called Vinyloop. It is a mechanical recycling process using a solvent to separate PVC from other materials. This solvent turns in a closed loop process in which the solvent is recycled. Recycled PVC is used in place of virgin PVC in various applications: coatings for swimming pools, shoe soles, hoses, diaphragms tunnel, coated fabrics, PVC sheets. This recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventional produced PVC. So the use of <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> leads to a significant better ecological footprint. The global warming potential is 39 percent lower.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{environmental}} benefits of using <b>recycled</b> <b>material,</b> plastic ties usually replace timber ties soaked in creosote, the latter being a toxic chemical, and are themselves recyclable. Hybrid plastic railroad ties and composite ties are used in other rail applications such as underground mining operations, industrial zones, humid environments and densely populated areas. Hybrid railroad ties are also used to be partly exchanged with rotten wooden ties, which will result in continuous track stiffness. Hybrid plastic ties and composite ties also offer benefits on bridges and viaducts, because they lead to better distribution of forces and reduction of vibrations into respectively bridge girders or the ballast. This is due to better damping properties of hybrid plastic ties and composite ties, which will decrease the intensity of vibrations {{as well as the}} sound production.|$|E

25|$|An {{early success}} in the {{recycling}} of plastics is Vinyloop, an industrial process to separate PVC from other materials through dissolution, filtration and separation of contaminants. A solvent is used in a closed loop to elute PVC from the waste. This {{makes it possible to}} recycle composite PVC waste, which is normally incinerated or put in a landfill. Vinyloop-based recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventionally produced PVC. The global warming potential is 39 percent lower. This is why the use of <b>recycled</b> <b>material</b> leads to a significantly better ecological outcome. This process was used after the Olympic Games in London 2012.
