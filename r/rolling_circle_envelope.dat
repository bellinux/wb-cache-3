40|$|ABSTRACT: Computer software, {{particular}} that known as Dynamic Geometry Software, {{has the potential}} to make significant improvements in how geometry is learnt and taught. For a long period geometry teaching has been conducted with a minimal amount of equipment – such as ruler and pair of compasses. Our view is that teachers should now have at their disposal an appropriate va-riety of equipment from which to select. As with any approach to teaching, the educational use of information and communication technology as well as computer software needs to be well thought through and carefully planned. In this paper we will concentrate on WinCAG (Windows version of Computer Aided Geometry) which has been especially designed for teaching and learning geometry. With this software package both simple constructions and complicated dependencies can easily be animated. We will particular focus on some special capabilities of WinCAG. These are the map-ping module, automated animations, building curves by tracing points, <b>rolling</b> <b>circles,</b> <b>envelopes</b> of moving objects, subdivision curves and the object recognition from free-hand drawings...|$|R

40|$|We have {{monitored}} {{the development of}} intracellular phiX DNA forms {{during the course of}} a virus life cycle that duplicates as closely as possible the normal infection of individual cells by single virions. The viral DNA was isolated in a one-step purification procedure, and quantitative electron microscopy was performed on the samples, resulting in the following conclusions: (i) Early in the life cycle, when the cells accumulate duplex rings, two types of DNA replication intermediates are observed: a <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> with a single-stranded tail; and a novel form, a single-stranded circle that is partially duplex. Thus, duplex ring synthesis appears to occur in two asymmetric steps, with positive strand DNA first being processed from the tail of the <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> and circularized, before it acts as a template for negative strand synthesis. (ii) Late in the life cycle, as single-stranded circles are synthesized and virus particles are assembled, only one replicating intermediate is observed [...] the <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> with a single-stranded tail. At this stage, the number of <b>rolling</b> <b>circles</b> reaches a level of about 35 per cell.

40|$|Studies to {{elucidate}} the reactions that {{occur at the}} eukaryotic replication fork have been limited by the model systems available. We have established a method for isolating and characterizing Simian Virus 40 (SV 40) replication complexes. SV 40 <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> complexes are isolated using paramagnetic beads and then incubated under replication conditions to obtain continued elongation. In <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> replication, the normal mechanism for termination of SV 40 replication does not occur and the elongation phase of replication is prolonged. Thus, using this assay system, elongation phase reactions can be examined {{in the absence of}} initiation or termination. We show that the protein requirements for elongation of SV 40 <b>rolling</b> <b>circles</b> are equivalent to complete SV 40 replication reactions. The DNA produced by SV 40 <b>rolling</b> <b>circles</b> is double-stranded, unmethylated and with a much longer length than the template DNA. These properties {{are similar to those of}} physiological replication forks. We show that proteins associated with the isolated <b>rolling</b> <b>circles,</b> including SV 40 T antigen, DNA polymerase alpha, replication protein A (RPA) and RF-C, are necessary for continued DNA synthesis. PCNA is also required but is not associated with the isolated complexes. We present evidence suggesting that synthesis of the leading and lagging strands are co-ordinated in SV 40 <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> replication. We have used this system to show that both RPA-protein and RPA-DNA interactions are important for RPA's function in elongation...|$|R

50|$|This PCR {{method is}} based upon <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> amplification, which is modeled from the method that {{bacteria}} use to amplify circular DNA. This method results in linear DNA duplexes. These fragments contain tandem repeats of circular DNA called concatamers, which can be transformed into bacterial strains. Mutations are introduced by first cloning the target sequence into an appropriate plasmid. Next, the amplification process begins using random hexamer primers and Φ29 DNA polymerase under error prone <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> amplification conditions. Additional conditions to produce error prone <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> amplification are 1.5 pM of template DNA, 1.5 mM MnCl2 and a 24 hour reaction time. MnCl2 is added into the reaction mixture to promote random point mutations in the DNA strands. Mutation rates can be increased by increasing the concentration of MnCl2, or by decreasing concentration of the template DNA. Error prone <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> amplification is advantageous relative to error prone PCR because of its use of universal random hexamer primers, rather than specific primers. Also the reaction products of this amplification {{do not need to}} be treated with ligases or endonucleases. This reaction is isothermal.|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} bacteriophage φX 174 RF † DNA replication by electron microscopy. Three different, types of replicative intermediates were observed: <b>rolling</b> <b>circles,</b> partially duplex DNA circles and structures {{consisting of two}} DNA circles connected at a single point. Rolling circles with a single-stranded or partially double-stranded DNA tail were both observed. After cleavage of the <b>rolling</b> <b>circles</b> with the restriction endonuclease from Providentia stuartii 164 (PstI) the startpoint of <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> replication could be located at 21 map units from the PstI cleavage site {{in agreement with the}} previously determined position of the origin of φX RF DNA replication. Partially duplex DNA circles consist of circular viral DNA strands and incomplete complementary DNA strands. After cleavage of these molecules with PstI information about the startpoints of the synthesis of the complementary DNA strand was obtained. The connected DNA circles always contain one completely double-stranded DNA circle whereas the other circle consists of either single-stranded, partially duplex or completely duplex DNA. Part of the duplex-to-duplex DNA circles represent the well-known figure eight or catenated circular dimers. The other connected DNA circles presumably represent replication intermediates which arise by the association {{of the end of the}} genome length tail of the <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> with the origin-terminus region. This is suggested by the fact that the point of contact between the two DNA circles is located at approximately 21 map units from the Pst 1 cleavage site, i. e. at the origin-terminus region of the φX genome. The connected DNA circles may be intermediates in the circularization and cleavage of the genome-length tail of the <b>rolling</b> <b>circles</b> in vivo.

40|$|Mobile genetic {{elements}} facilitate {{movement of}} genes, including those conferring antibiotic resistance and other traits, between bacteria. Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), {{also known as}} conjugative transposons, are a large family of mobile genetic elements that can transfer between neighboring cells. ICEs are found integrated in the chromosome of their host bacterium, where they are transmitted to daughter cells by chromosomal replication and cell division. Under certain conditions, ICE DNA will excise and form a circular plasmid-like intermediate. It was previously thought that ICEs were incapable of autonomous replication. However, my research, along {{with the work of}} others, shows that ICEs can replicate autonomously, and that many ICEs utilize a <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> replication mechanism. Plasmids and phages that use <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> replication encode a single strand origin (sso) that enhances priming of DNA synthesis. We identified a functional single strand origin, sso 1, in the integrative and conjugative element ICEBs 1 of Bacillus subtilis. Genetic analyses indicated that ICEBs 1 uses sso 1 and at least one other region for second strand DNA synthesis. Sso activity was important for autonomous, <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> replication of ICEBs 1 in host cells, and for stable acquisition of the element in new host cells. I also showed that the broad-host range ICE Tn 916 replicates autonomously by a <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> mechanism. Replication of Tn 916 was dependent on the relaxase encoded by Tn 916 orf 20. The origin of transfer of Tn 916, oriT(916), also functioned as an origin of replication. I found that the relaxase (Orf 20) and the two putative helicase processivity factors (Orf 22 and Orf 23) encoded by Tn 916 likely interact in a complex to facilitate replication. Lastly, I identified a functional single strand origin of replication (sso) in Tn 916 that I predict primes second strand synthesis during <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> replication. The importance of autonomous replication by <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> in the ICE lifecycle and horizontal gene transfer processes is discussed. by Laurel D. Wright. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|A simple new {{strategy}} for the in vitro synthesis of circular RNAs and hairpin ribozymes is described. Circular single-strand DNA oligonucleotides 67 - 79 nt in length are constructed to encode both hairpin ribozyme sequences and ribozyme-cleavable sequences. In vitro transcription of these small circles by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase produces long repeating RNAs by a <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> mechanism.

40|$|Plastid genomes of peridinin-containing {{dinoflagellates}} {{are unique}} in that its genes are found on multiple circular DNA molecules known as ‘minicircles’ of ∼ 2 – 3 kb in size, carrying from one to three genes. The non-coding regions (NCRs) of these minicircles share a conserved core region (250 – 500 bp) that are AT-rich and have several inverted or direct repeats. Southern blot analysis using an NCR probe, after resolving a dinoflagellate whole DNA extract in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), revealed additional positive bands (APBs) of 6 – 8 kb in size. APBs preferentially diminished from cells treated with the DNA-replication inhibitor aphidicolin, when compared with 2 – 3 kb minicircles, implicating they are not large minicircles. The APBs are also exonuclease III-sensitive, implicating the presence of linear DNA. These properties and the migration pattern of the APBs in a 2 D-gel electrophoresis were in agreement with a <b>rolling</b> <b>circle</b> type of replication, rather than the bubble-forming type.
