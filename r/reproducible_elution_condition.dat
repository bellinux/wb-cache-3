Several 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazones (DNPHo) were separated and quantified using an HPLC system and UV detection. In 16 min, <b>elution</b> <b>condition</b> 1 successfully separated and quantified the DNPHo of 14 CC including acetaldehyde, acrolein, formaldehyde, and furfural, and estimated the sum of C 4 isomers, butanal–isobutanal–butanone. This <b>elution</b> <b>condition</b> was able to resolve the pairs acrolein/furfural and propanone/propanal, which have been cited in the literature as difficult mixtures to be separated. The <b>elution</b> <b>condition</b> 2 allowed separation and quantification, in less than 30 min, of 13 out of the 17 CC listed above. This <b>elution</b> <b>condition</b> was also able to separate propanone from propanal and butanone from the other components of the C 4 mixture. When the two mobile phases were used together, they allowed confirmation {{of the presence of}} the DNPHo in the real samples.

40|$|The {{purification}} of "difficult" proteins {{for structural}} and functional studies remains a challenge. A widely used approach is their production as fusions with an affinity tag, {{so that a}} generic tag-based purification protocol can be applied. Alternatively, immuno-affinity using a protein-specific antibody allows purification of unmodified proteins in a single step, if mild <b>elution</b> <b>conditions</b> can be identified for dissociating the complex without disrupting the folding of the protein. Here, we describe a {{quantitative structure activity relationship}} (QSAR) strategy to predict optimized <b>elution</b> <b>conditions</b> from a mathematical model that relates target/antibody dissociation to environmental changes. We illustrate the strategy with the E 6 protein of the human papilloma virus (HPV) 16, a highly unstable protein central to HPV-induced carcinogenesis. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to measure the kinetics of dissociation of an E 6 peptide from an E 6 -specific antibody in a set of multivariate conditions, where three environmental factors (pH, NaCl concentration, and temperature) were varied. The QSAR model indicated that dissociation is favored at pH or = 10 if the temperature is high. We verified that the conclusions of the QSAR study with the peptide were valid for the scFv 1 F 4 /E 6 protein complex, and that the recovered protein was capable of mediating p 53 degradation. Finally, we demonstrated that the optimized <b>elution</b> <b>conditions</b> (pH 10, 35 degrees C) were adequate for purifying the recombinant E 6 protein from crude cell extracts...|$|R
40|$|International audienceElution of Chelex® binding layers, {{commonly}} {{used for the}} diffusive gradients in thin films technique (DGT), is recognized {{as the most important}} contributor to the uncertainty of DGT measurements. Limiting uncertainty requires the use of optimized procedures and suitable elution recoveries (fe). This work therefore investigated elution robustness to propose improved strategies. A wide range of conditions were investigated for the main elution parameters (Chelex® particle size, elution time, Chelex® loading, and eluent concentration and volume) on Al(III), Cd(II), Co(II), Cr(III), Cu(II), Ni(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II). Results showed that the choice of <b>elution</b> <b>conditions</b> should be a compromise driven by study constrains in terms of accuracy, repeatability, sensitivity, and targeted elements. Using experimentally determined recoveries should improve accuracy by approximately 5 to 10 % compared to the use of recoveries from the literature. Fast elution of 1 h can be achieved without significant loss of recovery and repeatability except for Cr(III) (8 h minimum). Elution recovery depended on Chelex® loading for Zn and Cr and introducing recoveries adapted to the loading could improve accuracy up to, respectively, 11 and 27 %. When standard recoveries are used, a 0. 85 fe value would be more appropriate than the common value of 0. 8 to minimize inaccuracy (except for Cr). Some flexibility can be applied to <b>elution</b> <b>conditions</b> without a significant change in recovery for most elements: HNO 3 concentration of 1 – 15 M, volume of 1 – 2 mL, duration of 8 – 48 h.

40|$|Summary: Hen {{egg yolks}} have been {{recognized}} as convenient source for specific antibodies, although their utility in diagnostic applications has been hampered {{by the lack of}} efficient purification methods. In the present study, anti-human parathyrin antibodies were raised in rabbits, hens and mice using synthetic human parathyrin peptide (1 — 84) as an antigen. The antibodies were affinity purified with amino- (1 - 30) and carboxy- (49 - 89) terminal peptides of parathyrin under highly alkaline <b>elution</b> <b>conditions,</b> and were evaluated for their diagnostic value in different combinations in immunoenzymometric assay (IEMA) format. A pair of hen egg yolk antibodies were subjected to further methodological validation in the IEMA that was constructed with the N-terminal capture and C-terminal detection antibodies. The synthetic intact human parathyrin (1 — 84) peptide served as a standard. This within-day IEMA procedure turned out to be sensitive and it correlated well with the two independent intact parathyrin immunoradiometric assays.

40|$|Native immunoprecipitation {{followed}} by protein A-mediated {{recovery of the}} immuno-complex is a powerful tool to study protein-protein interactions. A limitation of this technique is the concomitant recovery of large amounts of immunoglobulin, which interferes with down-stream applications such as mass spectrometric analysis and Western blotting. Here we report a detergent-based "soft" elution protocol that allows effective recovery of immunoprecipitated antigen and binding partners, yet avoids elution of {{the bulk of the}} immunoglobulin. We assessed the performance of the soft elution protocol using immunoprecipitation of Adaptor protein complex 1 (AP- 1) and associated proteins as a test case. Relative to conventional <b>elution</b> <b>conditions,</b> the novel protocol substantially improved the sensitivity of mass spectrometric identification of immunoprecipitated proteins from unfractionated solution digests. Averaging over three independent experiments, Mascot scores of identified AP- 1 binding partners were increased by 39 %.

In each case we observed a significant reduction of co-eluting immunoglobulin. The soft elution protocol presented here shows superior performance compared to standard <b>elution</b> <b>conditions</b> for subsequent protein identification by mass spectrometry from solution digests.

Due to the complexity of serum, pre-analytical sample simplification and separation are needed prior to mass spectrometric analysis. Use of a reverse-phase capillary column coupled to a mass spectrometer allows for separation and analysis of serum as part of efforts to discover biomarkers. Even after sample simplification by organic solvent precipitation, data files for a single sample typically exceed one gigabyte, making it difficult to analyze complete serum mass spectrometry profiles with currently available software. However, with adequate safeguards, it appears possible to consider portions of mass spectra to find differences in peak intensities between clinical comparison groups visually. To facilitate this, the elution profile was divided into 2 -min intervals in which mass spectrometry data were averaged. This required that molecular species had defined <b>reproducible</b> <b>elution</b> times.

Variable and sometimes significant amounts of BPA present in the background cause problems in obtaining good repeatability of measurements at the ultra-trace levels. Such observations (i. e., poor repeatability of results) were made during develop-ment of the LC-MS/MS method for determination of BPA in human serum samples. The method included gradient separa-tion of the sample’s constituents. The BPA peakwas present in the chromatograms not only when procedural blanks were injected but also when void injections were made. One of the possible ways to eliminate background contamination is to change the source of solvents, use a different water purifi-cation system, and introduce rigorous equipment cleaning procedures. However, despite the use of these recommended guidelines, the peak of BPA was still present in the system blank. It was observed that the intensity of the BPA peak was proportional to the time of column conditioning. It was concluded that BPA, present in the components of the mobile phase, is being enriched {{in the front of the}} separation column during its conditioning (i. e., when mobile phase elution strength was low).
