40|$|Cultures {{taken from}} the skin and from the hubs of {{short-term}} central venous catheters can help us to predict catheter-related bloodstream infections (C-RBSIs). The value of these cultures for such predictions has not been assessed in long-term catheters. Our objective {{was to assess the}} value of superficial cultures for the prediction of C-RBSI among patients with long-term cathe-ters. Over a 2 -year period, we prospectively obtained cultures from the skin overlying <b>reservoir</b> <b>ports</b> (group A) and from the skin insertion site and hubs of all tunneled catheters (group B). This routine was performed by vascular and interventional radi-ologists immediately before catheter removal (irrespective of the reason for withdrawal). Swabs were processed semiquantita-tively. Catheter tips from both groups were cultured usingMaki’s semiquantitative technique and sonication. We also per-formed cultures of the <b>reservoir</b> <b>ports</b> at different sites. C-RBSI was defined as the isolation of the same species of microorganism(s) both in the colonized catheter and in at least 1 peripheral blood culture. We included 372 catheters (group A, 223; group B, 149) during the study period. The catheter colonization rate was 23. 4 % (87 / 372), and 28 patients had C-RBSI. Va-lidity index values for the capacity of surface cultures to predict C-RBSI in groups A and B were, respectively, as follows: sensitiv-ity, 23. 5 % and 45. 5 %; specificity, 59. 7 % and 63. 0 %; positive predictive value, 4. 6 % and 8. 9 %; and negative predictive value, 90. 4 % and 93. 5 %.

30|$|While {{reporting}} the first cohort of TIVAP-related infections in the ICU, this retrospective study has some limitations. As we obtained data from patient’s medical charts, we cannot {{pretend to be}} exhaustive in data collection. Important information such as presence of thrombosis or endocarditis associated with TIVAP-related infection would have been interesting, but not all patients had a Doppler ultrasonography at time of admission. Then, {{it is likely that}} all patients with TIVAP admitted in participating ICU were not enrolled in the study since the main inclusion criteria was TIVAP removal. As a matter of fact, our inclusion criteria could have biased the true incidence of TIVAP-related infection toward overestimation. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, {{it was not possible to}} systematically identify patients who may have been admitted in our ICUs with a TIVAP in place that was not removed. The fact that positive blood cultures were available prior TIVAP removal may have also influenced clinicians’ decision. However, ICUs participating in the study had homogeneous practices regarding admission policy of immunocompromised patients and the decision to remove TIVAP in case of life-threatening sepsis. Last, the definition of TIVAP-related infection was extended to patients with positive blood culture without other suspected infection (n[*]=[*] 12) and regression of clinical signs of infection after TIVAP removal despite negative culture of TIVAP (catheter tip or the <b>reservoir’s</b> <b>port).</b> Since all our patients received antibiotics prior TIVAP removal, a condition that could fairly lead to misclassification, we estimated legitimate to consider these twelve patients as having TIVAP-related infection.|$|R

40|$|Another {{round of}} market / {{business}} favouring reform {{is changing the}} arrangements for strategic planning in England. This will merge existing arrangements for statutory regional and strategic planning (Regional Spatial Strategies) and for regional economic planning (Regional Economic Strategies) and award the making of this new single strategy to the business led Regional Development Agencies. Regional assemblies, who since about 2001 had prepared the RSSs, will be abolished by 2010. This reform sits within a wider swathe of pro-development government instructions to local authorities and other public bodies, including revised guidance on housing, economy and retail planning, and orders to increase the release of housebuilding land across all regions. This rests alongside {{the creation of a}} new machinery for infrastructure planning, within a government appointed Infrastructure Planning Commission, which will decide on all major infrastructure (power stations, <b>reservoirs,</b> <b>ports,</b> airports, road and rail schemes etc), within nationally set guidelines. Together this major reorientation of national, regional and strategic planning will (assuming the relevant legislation and arrangements go through as planned) introduce a new character to this public activity in England. This paper sketches some features that may be associated with these changes. These include: • A shift from strategic planning to implementation, both “strategic ” and project based. • A shifting of arenas of debate and conflict. • More research, but more targetted / skewed research. • Potentially more integrated planning? The paper argues that it is the joint effect of these new institutional and policy directions which will be critical to the operation of English planning. A comprehensive new regime regulating development is being put in place in 2008 - 2009, which is likely to oversee the redrawing of English regional and subregional geographies along more development and business friendly lines. ...|$|R

50|$|Manifolds {{intended}} for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder {{are connected to the}} cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement - face seal, and barrel seal. Face seal connections are similar to the DIN regulator connection seal, and consist of an o-ring in a groove machined into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the valve <b>port</b> by a <b>threaded</b> component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder centre distance. Barrel seals use one or two O-rings in grooves around the end of the manifold tube, which seal against the bore of the valve port. They are usually screwed into the valve <b>port</b> with handed <b>thread,</b> and locked with a lock-nut. They are generally slightly less rugged than face seal manifolds, and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder centre distance adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of neck thread specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical.|$|R

Materials and Methods In 23 patients, the difference between the identification of the <b>reservoir</b> fill <b>port</b> center using the manufacturer's template and fluoroscopic guidance was assessed on four consecutive refill procedures by a two physicians. A distance surpassing that between the center and the margin of the port (3. 5 mm) was considered a clinically relevant deviation. Analyses were performed with a one-sample t-test, with p < 0. 05 indicating statistical significance. Results The mean difference distance between identification markings of the target with fluoroscopic guidance and with the template was 8. 2 -mm, with limited variance (2. 7 -mm). For all individual refill procedures, the port center identification accuracy differed significantly from zero (all p < 0. 001) and from the clinically relevant cut-off point of 3. 5 -mm (all p < 0. 001). Only seven attempts (6. 4 %) were within the margins of the fill port. Conclusions Our results suggest poor accuracy of insertion point identification using the template.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} portable light-weight thread runtime system for uni- and multiprocessors targeted at irregular applications. Unlike most other thread packages, which utilize hard-coded scheduling policies, Active Threads provides a general mechanism for building data structure specific thread schedulers and for composing multiple scheduling policies {{within a single}} application. This allows modules developed separately to retain their scheduling policies when used together in a single application. Flexible scheduling policies can exploit the temporal and spatial locality inherent in many applications. In spite of the added flexibility, the Active Threads API is close to that of more conventional thread packages. Simple synchronization is achieved by standard mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables while more powerful parallel constructs can be easily built from threads, thread bundles (collections of threads with similar properties such as schedulers) and user-defined synchronization objects. Active Threads can be used directly by application and library writers or as a virtual machine target for compilers for parallel languages.

Diagnostic methods include catheter swabs, blood cultures and cultures of the catheter tip or <b>port</b> <b>reservoir.</b> In {{the case of a}} suspected CVAD-related bloodstream infection in paediatric oncology patients, in-situ treatment without prompt removal of the device can be attempted. Removal of the CVAD should be considered if bacteraemia persists or relapses ≥ 72 h after the initiation of (in-vitro effective) antibacterial therapy administered through the line. Timely removal of the device is also recommended if the patient suffers from a complicated infection, or if Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Candida spp. are isolated from blood cultures. Duration of therapy depends on the immunological recovery of the patient, the pathogen isolated and the presence of related complications, such as thrombosis, pneumonia, endocarditis and osteomyelitis.

40|$|Turbidity {{currents}} {{are major}} transport agents in reservoirs in which {{high concentrations of}} fine sediments flow in. Reservoir sedimentation due to turbidity currents is often severe in these cases. Turbidity currents are not well understood due to their complex turbulent flow structure, {{the interaction between the}} flow with the particles and the interaction between particles themselves. In this thesis the venting efficiency was determined for three reservoir implementations that might decrease sedimentation caused by turbidity currents. The three were: an additional sediment sluice, blocking a part of the reservoir and a deepened thalweg. Computations were done by means of a Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model. The Shihmen Reservoir in Taiwan was taken as a case study. In this particular reservoir suspended sediment concentrations are measured during the event of a turbidity current. According to the model results the additional sediment sluicing tunnel was the most effective solution.

40|$|A {{multistage}} electrophoresis apparatus {{has been}} invented {{for use in}} the separation of cells, protein molecules, and other particles and solutes in concentrated aqueous solutions and suspensions. The design exploits free electrophoresis but overcomes the deficiencies of prior free-electrophoretic separators by incorporating a combination of published advances in mathematical modeling of convection, sedimentation, electro-osmotic flow, and the sedimentation and aggregation of droplets. In comparison with other electrophoretic separators, these apparatuses are easier to use and are better suited to separation in relatively large quantities characterized in the art as preparative (in contradistinction to smaller quantities characterized in the art as analytical). In a multistage electrophoretic separator according to the invention, an applied vertical steady electric field draws the electrically charged particles of interest from within a cuvette to within a collection cavity that has been moved into position of the cuvette. There are multiple collection cavities arranged in a circle; each is aligned with the cuvette for a prescribed short time. The multistage, short-migration-path character of the invention solves, possibly for the first time, the fluid-instability problems associated with free electrophoresis. The figure shows a prototype multistage electrophoretic separator that includes four sample stations and five collection stages per sample. At each sample station, an aqueous solution or suspension containing charged species to be separated is loaded into a cuvette, which is machined into a top plate. The apparatus includes a lower plate, into which 20 collection cavities have been milled. Each cavity is filled with an electrophoresis buffer solution. For the collection of an electrophoretic fraction, the lower plate is rotated to move a designated collection cavity into alignment {{with the opening of the}} cuvette. An electric field is then applied between a non-gassing electrode in the collection cavity and an electrolyte compartment, which is separated from the cuvette by a semipermeable membrane. The electrolyte is refreshed by circulation by use of a peristaltic pump. In subsequent steps, the lower plate is rotated to collect other electrophoretic fractions. Later, the collected fractions are removed from the collection cavities through <b>ports</b> that have <b>threaded</b> plugs. The base of the apparatus contains power supplies and a computer interface. The design includes provisions for monitoring and feedback control of cavity position, electric field, and temperature. The operation of the apparatus can easily be automated, as demonstrated by use of software that has already been written for this purpose...|$|R
