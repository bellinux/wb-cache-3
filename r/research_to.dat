5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study indicated that}} yoga may improve psychological health during cancer treatment, although more complete clinical evidence is needed to confirm this possible effect. Other preliminary research indicated that yoga could be a useful supplementary treatment to reduce the general psychopathology of schizophrenia, and may have positive effects on mental health, although the quality of <b>research</b> <b>to</b> define these effects is low.|$|E

The purpose of an IMU is to probe a power system for its impedance characteristics to establish criteria for stable operation of the system.|$|E
5|$|Demand for bismuth {{was small}} prior to World War II and was {{pharmaceutical}} – bismuth compounds {{were used to}} treat such conditions as digestive disorders, sexually transmitted infections and burns. Minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for fire sprinkler systems and fuse wire. During World War II bismuth was considered a strategic material, used for solders, fusible alloys, medications and atomic <b>research.</b> <b>To</b> stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound (2.75 $/kg) {{during the war and}} at $2.25 per pound (4.96 $/kg) from 1950 until 1964.|$|E

5|$|Government, military, {{and private}} {{customers}} have acquired the 757 for uses ranging from aeronautical testing and <b>research</b> <b>to</b> cargo and VIP transport.

The first government operator of the 757 was the Mexican Air Force, which took delivery of a VIP-configured 757-200 in November 1987.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, it {{was decided}} that Norway was to extend its {{operations}} in Antarctica by establishing an all-year research station. By then, Norway was the only country with a territorial claim to Antarctica to not have an all-year research station on the continent. The government stated that the investment was motivated to improve climate <b>research,</b> <b>to</b> strengthen Norway as a bi-polar research nation and to strengthen Norway's role as a premise-maker in the environmental policy of the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|In 2017 Canadian {{scientists}} recreated an extinct {{horse pox}} virus {{to demonstrate that}} the smallpox virus can be recreated in a small lab {{at a cost of about}} $100,000, by a team of scientists without specialist knowledge. This makes the retention controversy moot since the virus can be easily recreated even if all samples are destroyed. Although the scientists performed the <b>research</b> <b>to</b> help development of new vaccines as well as trace smallpox's history, the possibility of the techniques being used for nefarious purposes was immediately recognized, leading to new regulation questions.|$|E

5|$|Muhammad and {{the other}} prophets of Islam, bored of living in jannah (heaven) and weary of singing the praises of Allah, request {{permission}} to return to Earth.

Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct <b>research,</b> <b>to</b> discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven. Allah, after removing his glasses, responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E

5|$|Of the $19.6 million {{spent on}} {{research}} and development of the electromagnetic process, $18 million (92 percent) was spent at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, and further work conducted at Brown University, Johns Hopkins University and Purdue University, and by the Tennessee Eastman corporation. During 1943, the emphasis shifted from <b>research</b> <b>to</b> development, engineering, and the training of workers to operate the production facilities at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. By the middle of 1944, there were nearly 1,200 people working at the Radiation Laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} scientific <b>research</b> <b>to</b> emerge from Morgan's laboratory concerned the biochemistry of vitamins and the nutritional value of foods.

In her early research work, Morgan analyzed processed foods and characterized their vitamin composition. She was the first to establish that a preservative, sulfur dioxide, protected vitamin C but damaged thiamine.|$|E

30|$|It is very {{important}} for exploring the new measuring technical means and corresponding analysis methods to tap the radio network performance potential fundamentally. First, new measuring technology should be <b>researched</b> <b>to</b> measure the radio network more efficiently and sufficiently; second, new measurement data analysis method should be <b>researched</b> <b>to</b> analyze the massive measurement data more scientifically and accurately. Thus, more precise problem location and optimization solution could be gotten to improve and upgrade the overall performance of the radio network sufficiently.|$|R

5|$|Taraborrelli {{decided to}} focus on the singer's private life; who she really was.

Taraborrelli and his team of private investigators interviewed Madonna's close friends, business associates, and family members including her father Silvio Ciccone.|$|E
5|$|Textual {{critics and}} palaeographers like Johann Jakob Wettstein, Constantin von Tischendorf, Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener and Caspar René Gregory dated the {{manuscript}} to the 10th century.

It is dated by the Institute for New Testament Textual <b>Research</b> <b>to</b> the 12th century because the frequent occurrence of enlarged letters, rounded breathing marks, flourishes and ligatures seem to eliminate earlier dates.|$|E
