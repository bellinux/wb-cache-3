5|$|On October 24, Hernández Morales led a {{group of}} six pirates in the robbery of Cabot, Bailey & Company in Saint Thomas, making off with US$5,000. On October 26 the USS Beagle, {{commanded}} by Charles T. Platt, navigated by John Low and carrying shopkeeper George Bedford (with a list of plundered goods, which were reportedly near Naguabo) left Saint Thomas. Platt sailed to Vieques, following a tip about a pirate sloop. Beagle opened fire, interrupting the capture of a sloop from Saint Croix, but the pirates docked at Punta Arenas in Vieques and fled inland; one, identified as Juan Felis, was captured after a shootout. When Platt disembarked in Fajardo to contact Juan Campos, a local associate of Bedford, the authorities accused him of piracy and detained him. The officer was later freed, but the pirates escaped. Commodore Porter's <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was later known as the Fajardo Affair led to a diplomatic crisis which threatened war between Spain and the United States; Campos was later found {{to be involved in}} the distribution of loot.|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} the music traditions of other Asian cultures, such as Persia and India, one strand of {{traditional}} Chinese music consists of a repertoire of traditional melodies, together known as qupai, in which tempo and ornamentation {{vary according to the}} mood of the instrumentalist, the audience, and their <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is being played, the same melody can be used to serve many different roles be it merry, melancholic or martial (this can be glimpsed in the love theme of the Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto where the same melody at different points in the lover's story reflects elation, turbulence and dejection). Many modern performers now play pieces by following a score in a standard way rather than in the changeable reflective individual way of tradition, this can at times lead to the feeling that a performance has been rushed.|$|E

25|$|After the battle, Ostorius was honoured with triumphal {{insignia}} but {{the victory}} did not entirely quell {{resistance in the}} Welsh borders. The Silures especially continued to harass Roman troops, supposedly after Ostorius had publicly said that they posed such a danger {{that they should be}} either exterminated or transplanted. A large legionary force occupied in building forts in Siluran territory was surrounded and attacked and only rescued with difficulty and considerable loss. This violent desperation {{on the part of the}} Silures can be attributed to their <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> Peter Salway calls Ostorius' lack of political judgement. The Silures had been galvanised by Ostorius' ill-thought out threats to destroy them and began taking Roman prisoners as hostages and distributing them amongst their neighbouring tribes. This had the effect of binding them all together and creating a new resistance movement.|$|E
500|$|In September 1994, New York Jets fullback Richie Anderson dislocated {{an index}} finger {{punching}} Douglass in the head, while Douglass {{was wearing a}} football helmet, in <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he believed was a late hit on teammate Adrian Murrell. [...] Anderson was ejected from the game. In his nine seasons with the Bears, he {{earned a reputation as}} an excellent special teams player.|$|E
500|$|By {{restoring}} 10 {{minutes to}} the film, the complex story now fits {{together in a}} seamless way, filling in those gaps found in the previous theatrical release, and proving that Peckinpah was firing on all cylinders for this, his grandest achievement. ... And the one overwhelming feature that the director's cut makes unforgettable are the many faces of the children, whether playing, singing, or cowering, much of the <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> happens on-screen is through the eyes, both innocent and imitative, of all the children.|$|E
5000|$|An {{accountant}} (Jack Plotnick) then {{passes out}} binoculars {{to the group}} and rides off on a bicycle.

5000|$|Ferris {{thinks of}} love as romance and wine and flowers. She imagines herself swept {{off her feet}} by Gary, the camp counselor. When she lies about [...] "making love" [...] with him, the {{biological}} side manifests itself in others' <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> she said she did. She discovers that, {{at least in the}} context of a camp counselor having sex with a fifteen-year-old, sex can be hurtful and its consequences ugly. Her attitude is now more grounded in reality; she has become more like street-wise Angel.|$|R

500|$|Eleven {{weeks before}} the Beatles' arrival in the U.S. President JohnF. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. The nation was in mourning, in fear, and in disbelief. The {{assassination}} came after a fifteen-year build-up of Cold War tension. The motivation and identity of the assassin would be doubted by many Americans for decades, despite the Warren Commission's issued report in September 1964. As the United States tried to restore a sense of normality, teenagers in particular struggled to cope, as their disbelief began {{to be replaced by}} a personal <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> had happened: in school essays, teenagers wrote that [...] "then it became real", and [...] "I was feeling the whole world is going to collapse on me", and [...] "I never felt so empty in all my life".|$|E
500|$|As {{the mid-1990s}} {{included}} adaptations of four Austen novels, {{there were few}} of her works to adapt. Andrew Higson argues that {{this resulted in a}} [...] "variety of successors" [...] in the genres of romantic comedy and costume drama, as well as with films featuring strong female characters. Cited examples include Mrs Dalloway (1997), Mrs. Brown (1997), Shakespeare in Love (1998), and Bridget Jones's Diary (2001). In 2008, Andrew Davies, the screenwriter of Pride and Prejudice, adapted Sense and Sensibility for television. As a <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he said was Lee's overly [...] "sentimental" [...] film, this production features events found in the novel but excluded from Thompson's screenplay, such as Willoughby's seduction of Eliza and his duel with Brandon. It also features actors closer to the ages in the source material.|$|E
500|$|Beggars Banquet {{was delayed}} for nearly six months due to {{controversy}} over {{the design of the}} album cover, which featured a public toilet with graffiti covering the walls of the stall. Beggars Banquet was well received at the time of release. Richards said, [...] "There is a change between material on Satanic Majesties and Beggars Banquet. I'd grown sick to death of the whole Maharishi guru shit and the beads and bells. Who knows where these things come from, but I guess [...] was a <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> we'd done in our time off and also that severe dose of reality.

Subsequently, the editor who approved the column was fired. Taibbi defended the piece as [...] "off-the-cuff burlesque of truly tasteless jokes," [...] written to give his readers a break from a long run of his [...] "fulminating political essays".

500|$|The Popjustice £20 Music Prize, {{also known}} as the Popjustice Twenty Quid Prize, is an annual prize awarded by music website Popjustice to {{recognise}} the best British pop single of the previous year. [...] The prize was conceived by Popjustice founder Peter Robinson in 2003 as a <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he perceived as the pompous and elitist nature of the existing Mercury Prize, which recognises the best album of the previous year, and in particular its exclusion of pop music acts in favour of those from more esoteric genres. [...] The shortlist for the Popjustice prize is announced in September of each year and the winner named the following month, to coincide with the presentation of the Mercury Prize. [...] Popjustice gives a token prize of £20 to the winner of its award, in contrast to the £20,000 given to the winner of the Mercury Prize.|$|E
500|$|Pound {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the war. He was devastated when Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, from whom he had commissioned a sculpture of himself two years earlier, {{was killed in the}} trenches in 1915. He published Gaudier-Brzeska: A Memoir the following year, in <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he saw as an unnecessary loss. In the autumn of 1917 his depression worsened. He blamed American provincialism for the seizure of the October issue of The Little Review. [...] The New York Society for the Suppression of Vice applied the Comstock Laws against an article Lewis wrote, describing it as lewd and indecent. Around the same time, Hulme was killed by shell-fire in Flanders, and Yeats married Georgie Hyde-Lees. In 1918, after a bout of illness which was presumably the Spanish influenza, Pound decided to stop writing for The Little Review, mostly because of the volume of work. He asked the publisher for a raise to hire 23-year-old Iseult Gonne as a typist, causing rumors that Pound {{was having an affair with}} her, but he was turned down.|$|E
500|$|Avatar {{describes}} the conflict by an indigenous people, the Na'vi of Pandora, against {{the oppression of}} alien humans. [...] Director James Cameron acknowledged that the film is [...] "certainly about imperialism {{in the sense that}} the way human history has always worked is that people with more military or technological might tend to supplant or destroy people who are weaker, usually for their resources." [...] Critics agreed that the film is [...] "a clear message about dominant, aggressive cultures subjugating a native population in a quest for resources or riches." [...] George Monbiot, writing in The Guardian, asserted that conservative criticism of Avatar is a <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he called the film's [...] "chilling metaphor" [...] for the European [...] "genocides in the Americas", which [...] "massively enriched" [...] Europe. Cameron told National Public Radio that references to the colonial period are in the film [...] "by design". [...] Adam Cohen of The New York Times compared the struggle of the Na'vi with [...] "a 22nd-century version of the American colonists vs. the British, India vs. the British Raj, or Latin America vs. United Fruit." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dilemmas in narrative research {{created by the}} gaps between the authority of experience (the participant’s understanding {{of his or her}} life) and the authority of expertise (the researcher’s interpretive analysis of that life). It raises the question of who, at various levels, "owns" the narrative. Using a detailed case example, the paper explores the relationship between authority and authorship as it contrasts the researcher’s intention and the participant’s <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is presented. Ethical dilemmas that ensue are not easily managed, but a suggestion is offered. The dynamics of narcissism that underlie the interpersonal stress of telling another’s life are also considered...|$|R

Reznor explained this move by saying [...] "It's a stance we're taking that we feel is appropriate with digital technology, and outdated copyright laws, and all the nonsense that's going on these days". Jim Guerinot, then manager of Nine Inch Nails, explained the unconventional release of the album as [...] " [...] a <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> doesn’t exist today. it’s more just like, 'Hey, in a vacuum I can do whatever I want to do.'" [...] The digital-release of the album reportedly required an extensive overhaul of the Nine Inch Nails website {{in order for the}} site to cope with the influx of traffic, online-payments, and customer service needs of releasing the album.

500|$|Some reviewers {{still felt}} that Lightning Bolt was {{not up to}} the {{standards}} set by the band's previous work. Blue Sullivan of Slant Magazine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that the album had a [...] "familiar spark" [...] and was dragged down by [...] "Pearl Jam's antiseptic '70s-album-rock-radio conservatism, along with frontman Eddie Vedder's ham-fisted lyrics", ultimately concluding that [...] "Lightning Bolt is no masterwork. Years removed from the raw emotion and desperate appetites of youth, Pearl Jam has slipped into alt-rock elder statesmanship as one would a comfortable old sweater." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin gave the album a six out of ten, describing it as [...] "far from an implosion, far from spectacular", criticizing the focus on calm songs and considering that Backspacer [...] "barked louder and bit harder overall." [...] In his 5.0 out of 10 review for Pitchfork, Stuart Berman also had a negative <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he described as [...] "centerpiece ballads [...] tread on odious Lite-FM territory and forcefully tip the scales from poignant to maudlin". Philip Cosores of Paste gave the album a 4.0 out of 10, saying [...] "The album does grow on the listener, as Vedder's voice and the band's seeming ambivalence to all musical trends and developments outside of them is strangely comforting. And maybe some of these songs will come alive when performed, but {{there is not a single}} one to love in the set. Essentially, the cruise control is running onward with disregard for all the maintenance and repairs that an engine needs, and the result is the worst album of their career." ...|$|E

[...] Later, she writes that [...] "The narrator gives the reader no information about Dinah's thoughts or feelings or her <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> has taken place.

40|$|This article {{includes}} narrative excerpts {{compiled from}} field notes the author collected observing six Australian women's elite artistic gymnasts {{and their two}} coaches. Using creative nonfiction and auto-ethnography, the stories' plots describe the gymnasts' daily training realities and include personal reflections on the author's gymnastics experiences and <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> she saw during the observations. The stories illustrate how, despite differing levels of authority, the coaches', gymnasts', and parts of her own identity and behaviors are shaped by a dominant gymnastics model. This ideal coerces the coaches and gymnasts to regulate their selves and behaviors according to its dominant characteristics. Although potentially beneficial and satisfactory, the training model's discourses and practices can have debilitating effects...|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic method}} of {{psychoanalysis}} is {{interpretation of the}} patient's unconscious conflicts that are interfering with current-day functioning - conflicts that are causing painful symptoms such as phobias, anxiety, depression, and compulsions. Strachey (1936) stressed that figuring out ways the patient distorted perceptions about the analyst led <b>to</b> understanding <b>what</b> may have been forgotten (also see Freud's paper [...] "Repeating, Remembering, and Working Through"). In particular, unconscious hostile feelings toward the analyst {{could be found in}} symbolic, negative <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> Robert Langs later called the [...] "frame" [...] of the therapy - the setup that included times of the sessions, payment of fees, and necessity of talking. In patients who made mistakes, forgot, or showed other peculiarities regarding time, fees, and talking, the analyst can usually find various unconscious [...] "resistances" [...] to the flow of thoughts (sometimes called free association).|$|R

2500|$|Conservative Judaism {{developed}} in Europe and the United States {{in the late}} 1800s, as Jews reacted to the changes {{brought about by the}} enlightenment and emancipation. In many ways it was a <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> were seen as the excesses of the Reform movement. [...] For much of the movement's history, Conservative Judaism deliberately avoided publishing systematic explications of theology and belief; this was a conscious attempt to hold together a wide coalition. [...] This concern became a non-issue after the left-wing of the movement seceded in 1968 to form the Reconstructionist movement, and after the right-wing seceded in 1985 to form the Union for Traditional Judaism.|$|E

Some of these groups would later adopt synths. While punk rock wielded {{a major influence on}} the popular music scene in the UK, in the US the music’s stigma of violence and sexual deviance made it virtually unmarketable.
