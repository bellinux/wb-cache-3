The Homeless Veterans' <b>Reintegration</b> <b>Program</b> (HVRP) is the only national program that is exclusively focused on assisting veterans as they reenter the workforce. In addition, the VETS program also has an Incarcerated Veterans' Transition Program as well as services that are unique to female Veterans. Mainstream programs initiated by the Department of Labor have included the Workforce Investment Act, One-Stop Career Centers, and a Community Voice Mail system that helps to connect homeless individuals around the United States with local resources. In addition, targeted labor programs have included the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Project, the Disability Program Navigator Initiative, efforts to end chronic homelessness through providing employment and housing projects, Job Corps, and the Veterans Workforce Investment Program (VWIP).|$|E

40|$|While <b>reintegration</b> <b>programs</b> for ex‐combatants {{have become}} {{a major focus of}} cease fire agreements, their success remains elusive. In this study, I {{interview}} members of Nuevo Horizonte, an intentional community comprised of Guatemalan ex‐guerrillas. These men and women reflect on two questions: what was reintegration like, and what advice do you have for other reintegrating ex-combatants. Using a grounded theory approach, common themes (such as being united) were developed and lead to a substantive theory of their transformative reintegration process. The collective voice of these ex‐ combatants challenges conventional <b>reintegration</b> <b>programs</b> by (a) challenging the demobilization prerogative showcasing how their unity was integral to their reintegration experience and (b) challenging the development model in which ex‐combatants are viewed as lacking capacity and in need of outside experts to deliver solutions. By highlighting how reliance on their own capacity resulted in their successful reintegration, these ex‐combatants believe their experience can assist other ex‐combatants around the world...|$|R

50|$|Issues {{relating}} to the communication between {{victims and their families}} concerning the severity of the soldiers adolescent experiences were evident during the reintegration process. This issue stemmed from the failure of <b>reintegration</b> <b>programs</b> to successfully prepare and provide caregivers with direction in preparation for the victims return. These programs tended to focus primarily on the child. It was evident that where caregivers were unable to monitor and understand the severity of the victims exposure to violence, it heavily affected the child's ability to reintegrate into the community. Alternatively in some cases victims struggled to communicate their feelings due to the guilt, shame and stigma attached to their experiences. In these situations the severity of their communicative problems were dependent on the victims age, gender and role in the conflict.

The article uses data collected from Liberia to demonstrate that such thinking stigmatizes ex-combatants and works against the objective of reintegration: it disrupts integration into the everyday social, economic, and political life of the post-conflict state and aims instead to render ex-combatants separate from communities. Integration will remain elusive unless assumptions about ex-combatants as program beneficiaries are challenged. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
