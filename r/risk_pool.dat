5|$|The {{purpose of}} the mandate was to prevent the {{healthcare}} system from succumbing to adverse selection, which would result in high premiums for the insured and little coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured. Studies by the CBO, Gruber and Rand Health concluded that a mandate was required. The mandate increased the size and diversity of the insured population, including more young and healthy participants to broaden the <b>risk</b> <b>pool,</b> spreading costs. Experience in New Jersey and Massachusetts offered divergent outcomes.|$|E

25|$|A {{key feature}} of the Dutch system is that {{premiums}} may not be related to health status or age. Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through risk equalization and a common <b>risk</b> <b>pool.</b> Funding for all short-term health care is 50% from employers, 45% from the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about €100 per month (about US$127 in August 2010 and in 2012 €150 or US$196,) with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and deductible a year €220 (U.S. $288).|$|E

I find that more extrinsic commitment is associated with more <b>risk</b> <b>pooling,</b> but that more information is associated with less <b>risk</b> <b>pooling.</b> The first of these results accords with our expectations and assumptions. The second does not. I offer two explanations as to the origin of the second result and discuss their implications for how we view the assumptions made elsewhere in the literature.

2500|$|In the United States, {{the most}} {{prevalent}} form of self-insurance is governmental risk management pools. They are self-funded cooperatives, operating as carriers of coverage {{for the majority of}} governmental entities today, such as county governments, municipalities, and school districts. [...] Rather than these entities independently self-insure and risk bankruptcy from a large judgment or catastrophic loss, such governmental entities form a <b>risk</b> <b>pool.</b> Such pools begin their operations by capitalization through member deposits or bond issuance. Coverage (such as general liability, auto liability, professional liability, workers compensation, and property) is offered by the pool to its members, similar to coverage offered by insurance companies. However, self-insured pools offer members lower rates (due to not needing insurance brokers), increased benefits (such as loss prevention services) and subject matter expertise. [...] Of approximately 91,000 distinct governmental entities operating in the United States, 75,000 are members of self-insured pools in various lines of coverage, forming approximately 500 pools. [...] Although a relatively small corner of the insurance market, the annual contributions (self-insured premiums) to such pools have been estimated up to 17 billion dollars annually.|$|E

40|$|In rural economies with {{missing or}} {{incomplete}} markets, idiosyncratic <b>risk</b> is frequently <b>pooled</b> through informal networks. Idiosyncratic shocks, however, {{are not limited to}} private goods but can also restrict an individual from partaking in or benefiting from a collective activity. In these situations, a group must decide whether to provide insurance to the affected member. We describe results of a laboratory experiment designed to test whether a simple sharing institution can sustain <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> in a social dilemma with idiosyncratic risk. We tested whether <b>risk</b> could be <b>pooled</b> without a commitment device and, separately, whether effective <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> induced greater cooperation in the social dilemma.

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that {{transfers}} received from government, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), friends, and relatives help rural households to <b>pool</b> <b>risk.</b> In this article I investigate two functions of transfers in Ethiopia: <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> and income redistribution.

I find evidence that transfers from government/NGOs {{play a role in}} insuring covariant income shocks and evidence that transfers from both government/NGOs and friends/relatives redistribute income. However, the contributions of these transfers to <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> and income redistribution are economically very limited. Moreover, transfers from friends/relatives do not play a role in risk sharing. Although transfers only play a minor role in <b>risk</b> <b>pooling,</b> households in the study villages are found to be able to insure most of their idiosyncratic income shocks and part of their covariant income shocks.

40|$|A {{phenomenon}} {{that is now}} well known as the bullwhip effect suggests that the variability of orders increases as they move up the supply chain from retailers to wholesalers to manufacturers to suppliers. In this paper, we will focus mainly on measuring the bullwhip effect. Existing approaches that aim at quantifying the bullwhip effect neglect the network structure of supply chains. By only assuming a simple two-stage supply chain consisting of a single retailer and a single manufacturer, some of the relevant <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> effects associated with the network structure of supply chains are disregarded. <b>Risk</b> <b>pooling</b> effects arise when the orders, which a retailer receives from its customers, are statistically correlated with a coefficient of correlation less than one. When analyzing the bullwhip effect in supply chains, however, the influence of <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> has to be considered. The fact that these influences {{have not yet been}} analyzed motivates the research presented in this paper. We will show that the bullwhip effect is overestimated if just a simple supply chain is assumed and <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> effects are present.

5000|$|The {{benefits}} from <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> depend {{directly on the}} relative market behavior.

5000|$|<b>Risk</b> <b>pooling</b> is an {{important}} concept in supply chain management. [...] <b>Risk</b> <b>pooling</b> suggests that demand variability is reduced if one aggregates demand across locations because as demand is aggregated across different locations, it becomes more likely that high demand from one customer will be offset by low demand from another. This reduction in variability allows a decrease in safety stock and therefore reduces average Inventory.|$|R
50|$|To {{overcome}} the problem, some governments have made basic health insurance compulsory and {{also created a}} risk equalization pool {{to even out differences}} in risks carried by insurance companies in the health market. Thus, the younger and healthier people must pay into the risk equalization pool, and the older and sicker people will receive money from the equalization pool. A government agency usually assigns the risks and manages the <b>risk</b> <b>pool.</b> Governments can then subsidize health care for the unemployed or the retired by the <b>risk</b> <b>pool</b> system. The presence of a risk equalization pool and a common health benefits system makes competition more transparent between health insurers and prevents them from behaving in ways that discourage the achievement of a universal health care system for the nation.|$|E

30|$|Finally, {{risk and}} {{information}} asymmetry can be {{introduced in the}} economic analysis of secession. Typically, political union allows to some extent <b>risk</b> <b>pooling,</b> which reduces individuals’ income uncertainty. However, <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> may also generate a well-known moral hazard problem since regions may have less incentives to implement policies that decrease national risk. Van Hagen and Eichengreen (1996) analyze such a trade-off between <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> and moral hazard behavior {{in the case of}} the European Union. Another trade-off related to uncertainty is the one studied by Persson and Tabellini (1996). The latter consider two kinds of risk that each individual is facing: An economic risk and a political risk. The former is a centripetal force since some insurance (<b>risk</b> <b>pooling)</b> is possible across the regions of the same country. The latter derives from the diversity of voters in a large union. This leads to uncertainty about the median voter’s income and then the public policy that is eventually chosen. Political uncertainty increases with the size of the country and constitutes the main centrifugal (secessionist) force. Secession mitigates political uncertainty in reducing discrepancies between voters. However, it comes at the expense of the inter-regional insurance mechanism.|$|R
