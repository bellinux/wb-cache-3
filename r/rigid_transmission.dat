50|$|After these progresses, Cristea, {{together}} with Ionel Zamfirescu, a motorcycling champion, decided to modify a Ford V8 {{in order to}} attempt a top finish in the 1936 Monte Carlo Rally. To help him, Ford Romania gave him an already competitive Ford V8, which he heavily tuned up: he only kept from the original car the radiator's mask, the engine hood, the headlights, the fenders, the windshield and the dashboard. He modified the engine, which received a British-made cylinder head which reduced the compression ratio, he replaced the Delco ignition with a Vertex-Scintila magneto and replaced the stock carburettor with a double Weber carburettor taken from Maserati, he reinforced the chassis, changed the shocks with some Lincoln provenence, more rigid shocks, obtained a <b>rigid</b> <b>transmission</b> by obtaining the current effect of the limited slip differential and transformed the car's body into a roadster's body. When the car was finished, he stated that he couldn't possibly take any more weight off his car. Together with his team mate Ionel Zamfirescu and his mechanic Gogu Constantinescu he started the rally from Athens and arrived to Monte Carlo without accumulating any penalty points (like other 15 crews). The winner {{was going to be}} selected after a slalom contest, which Cristea won 0.4 seconds ahead of Frenchman Laury Schell, driving a more powerful Delahaye. This was Ford's first win at Monte Carlo and Romania's only victory in the Principality. The following year, he won the Monte Carlo Rally, but he was disqualified because his back fenders were illegal (they did not fully covered the wheels). In 1939, he won a sports car event at the Nürburgring in Germany. In the post-war period, Cristea only competed in local races and hillclimbing events in Romania.|$|E

This paper uses different tyre/transmission physical models to assess the modelling features which are essential for an accurate description of the plant. Three different single-wheel models are presented and analysed in order to find the simplest, yet reliable, model for the description of the engine-to-slip dynamics. The models are a single-wheel model with a rigid tyre and a <b>rigid</b> <b>transmission,</b> a single-wheel model with a flexible tyre, and a single-wheel model which features a compliant tyre and a sprocket absorber. Analytic expressions for all models' transfer functions are given, and models are compared to each other and with road tests to prove their reliability.

Linear drives with flexible transmission elements are cheaper and also more efficient than the ones with <b>rigid</b> <b>transmissions</b> like power screw systems.

By means of a mathematical model we report the results of a series of tests show the dynamic effects of the transmission elasticity. The simulation results show that the law of motion can induce significant link and end effector vibrations. These are due to the law of motion itself and to the occurrence of resonance. We will demonstrate that, by an appropriate computing of the servomotors laws of motion, the end-effector trajectories can be followed precisely enough, even if the transmission are not very stiff (e. g. timing belt).

The dynamical effects related with transmission elasticity are analysed by means of a mathematical model and some dedicated software. The simulation results show how different laws of motion can induce end-effector vibrations, sometimes quite wide caused by occurrence of resonance. These vibrations can be reduced by means of an appropriate computing of the servomotors laws of motion; in this paper an algorithm is described to determine the above-mentioned laws of motions. The authors propose a method to compute servomotors laws of motion that permit to the end-effector to describe a planned trajectory with a robot arm having non <b>rigid</b> <b>transmission</b> between motors and links; this technique just needs the knowledge of a simple manipulator mathematical model and is apart from the control system.

40|$|A 40 MHz cavity {{has been}} {{constructed}} at CERN {{as part of}} the PS upgrade program for injection into LHC. To compensate for the variable capacitive power coupling and mechanical tolerance during fabrication, a coarse tuner has been envisaged to correct the resonant frequency of the PS 40 MHz cavity. This consists of a shorted loop inside the cavity and by rotating the loop, the magnetic coupling to the cavity can be varied and hence a coarse tuning is obtained. The coarse tuner can not be changed when the cavity is in vacuum. The fine tuner is to compensate for slow variation of resonant frequency of the cavity due to temperature and pressure variation. The tuner employs a variable capacitor as the tuning element. It is connected to a loop inside the cavity via a ceramic window and a <b>rigid</b> <b>transmission</b> line of suitable length. The desired tuning range of the coarse tuner is 1 % and the fine tuner is 0. 5 %. The coarse tuner has been designed and tested at TRIUMF on a full scale wooden model of the CERN cavity. The fine tuner was designed using PSPICE with the same loop as the coarse tuner. This tuner has been constructed at CERN and also installed in the cavity. Excellent agreement was found between the predicted and the measured tuning ranges of both the tuners on the 40 MHz CERN cavity. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} {{the benefits of}} series elastic actuation in performing a balancing task on a humanoid robot. By having the possibility to replace the type of transmission at the ankles level, {{it was possible to}} repeat the very same experiment in two different conditions: (1) Using series elastic actuators (SEA); (2) Replacing the elastic elements with <b>rigid</b> <b>transmissions.</b> The experiments consisted in perturbing a balanced posture with an impulsive force. Perturbations were applied in two different scenarios: hitting the robot on the upper body and at the support platform, thus acting above and under the actuated joint. The applied perturbations were controlled to be repeatable and the static stiffness of the rigid and elastic actuators were tuned to match. With these assumptions, static responses were the same in the two conditions; differences appeared only during the dynamic response and are motivated by different proportions between active and passive stiffness. In both scenarios, results show that series elasticity simplifies the role of the balancing controller by low pass filtering the dynamics of the zero moment point, consistently observing a more stable balance recovery with SEAs through all the experiments.

40|$|Many robots {{excel at}} precise {{positioning}} and trajectory tracking using software control, and most successful robotic applications utilize this ability—examples include CNC machining, robotic welding, painting, and pick-and-place circuit board assembly. The mechanical design of these robots focuses on <b>rigid</b> <b>transmissions</b> and minimizing compliance in the structure, so the software controller can accurately track a desired {{position as a}} function of time, regardless of any disturbance forces. However, there is a class of tasks for which rigid actuation is not ideal: physical interaction with the world, especially interaction that involves an impact or kinetic energy transfer. Animals tend to excel at these tasks, and far outperform the best robots. Examples include walking, running, catching a ball, gripping a piece of fruit firmly but without causing damage, and many types of assembly tasks. For dynamic behaviors such as running, the performance limitations of a robot are often due to limitations of the mechanical design. A robot is an integrated system of electronics, software, and mechanism, and each part of the system limits or enables the behavior of the whole. While some behaviors can easily be implemented through simple actuators and direct software control, a running machine requires mechanical design that is specialized for the task. Among other things...|$|R
40|$|Recently, other {{researchers}} have demonstrated that force sensing and control capabilities can be implemented on a robot manipulator {{without the use of}} an explicit force/torque sensor. Instead, a measured flexible, or compliant, mechanism is added to an otherwise <b>rigid</b> joint <b>transmission</b> assembly and the joint forces are determined by measuring the compliant mechanism displacement [Williamson, 1995; Shah, 1997]. This thesis investigates an alternative nonlinearly compliant joint transmission mechanism design that may be used to improve the dexterity of future planetary exploration manipulators. The proposed nonlinear compliant element is based on the concept of a wrapping spring that undergoes a continuous decrease in spring free length and a resulting increase in stiffness for greater displacements. Multiple generations of prototypes were constructed to explore and evaluate mechanism design issues regarding the stiffening profile, the robustness, and the manufacturing, assembly, and integration methods.

40|$|There is {{interest}} in designing biologically inspired underwater vehicles that propel themselves with flapping foils like fish, because fish performance suggests a desirable combination of maneuverability and efficiency. Bluefin Tuna, for example, {{are known to}} migrate long distances while also being able to perform high acceleration maneuvers and swim at speeds in excess of 100 km/hr. To achieve performance on par with biological swimmers, a machine must replicate the fluid dynamic interactions between a fish's body and water {{as well as the}} efficient actuation of its control surfaces. It isn't feasible to design actuators that are well suited for such devices without a relationship between the kinematics of a flexible body in water and the forces on it. It is difficult to derive these forces analytically, however, since this would require a solution to Navier-Stokes equations. It is also challenging to design a mechanical drivetrain that fits within the envelope of a fish and can generate comparable forces and displacements. This thesis explores an experimental approach to designing an efficient, self-propelled underwater vehicle that is modeled after a. 681 m long Skipjack Tuna. Analytical models are used to estimate the joint torques required to maintain biological swimming kinematics, to select optimal actuators, and to size the components of a drivetrain for the device. The drivetrain of this prototype has <b>rigid</b> <b>transmission</b> elements and is designed with low friction drive components. These properties will allow us to measure the actuator torque profiles and from them estimate the torque applied to each segment of the device to inform the design of specialized actuators. The machine is mostly assembled, and position control loops were designed and tuned based on the measured open loop transfer functions of the joints in air. Unfortunately, we were unable to finish assembly of the device and test it in fluid. by Phillip Howard Daniel. Thesis: S.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1999 This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} application of computational intelligence techniques to two open problems in high performance electromechanical drives. The objective is to develop non-linear state estimation methods and control systems for the problems under investigation. The performance of speed sensorless control of induction motor drives currently suffers due {{to the absence of}} an accurate non-linear state estimator. An ideal estimator has to be robust to large motor parameters variations and should be able to account for non-linearities. Neural networks offer many advantages over mathematical models including the ability to learn from training examples and approximate any complex non-linear function. A new speed estimator for induction motor drives is presented here along with simulation results. Extended Kalman filters are widely used as non-linear state estimators when the model for a non-linear plant is known. A new adaptive, non-linear state estimator is developed in this work which combines neural networks with an Extended Kalman filter. Simulation results for this adaptive estimator are presented. The developed state estimator does not specifically depend on any properties of induction motors and can be used with a class of non-linear systems. The second problem investigated here is Precision Position Control using Elastic Links. At present, <b>rigid</b> <b>transmission</b> elements such as lead screws are used in applications requiring a positioning accuracy better than 50 microns. Elastic transmission elements such as belt drives can be used in such applications if the control system is improved to obtain better accuracy. The use of belt drives makes the plant non-linear and reduces the accuracy that can be obtained using linear control systems. A non-linear controller is required to obtain high accuracy control using such elements. In this work, a combination of non-linear feedback control using fuzzy logic and non-linear feedforward control using evolutionary algorithm based system identification is developed. Experimental results show the efficacy of the control system in obtaining a positioning accuracy of 0. 5 microns. The control system developed can be applied to other elastic systems without significant design changes. A self-tuning algorithm using evolutionary programming is developed which gives better results than a manually tuned controller...|$|E
40|$|Periacetabular osteolysis is a {{significant}} complication following total hip replacement surgery. It {{is believed to be}} caused by wear debris and high fluid pressures within the joint capsule. To investigate the mechanisms by which high fluid pressures are generated in total hip replacement, a physical model of the hip joint was constructed, the Acetabular Pressure Transmission Rig (APTR). An aluminium chamber held the bone analogue, a polyurethane hemisphere with a 52 mm acetabular cavity, and the prosthetic components, a 28 mm femoral head and various uncemented cups, were inserted without press-fit to simulate cup loosening. A synovial fluid analogue was introduced into the chamber through an elevated reservoir. <b>Rigid</b> <b>transmission</b> tubes conducted fluid pressures from the cup-cavity interface to external transducers. The APTR was loaded under various conditions and the pressures produced by the loading regimes were analysed. Pressures over 35 kPa, previously shown by other groups to cause osteolysis, were measured within the APTR, reaching a maximum of 131. 3 kPa measured at the pole of the cup. Changes in load application led to pressure changes within the APTR, with higher loading frequency and magnitude leading to higher median pressure amplitudes. The presence of different component features, such as screw holes in the metal shell, was also shown to affect periacetabular pressures. Tests with a fibrous rim interposed between the prosthetic cup and the test cavity showed an 88 % reduction in periacetabular pressures, as the increased rim interference between cup and cavity prevented fluid ingress behind the cup. A larger initial separation between the loading head and the acetabular cup caused {{a significant}} increase in measured pressures, with a 0. 15 mm increase in head-cup separation producing a 53 % increase in pressures measured at the pole of the cup. Pressure differentials between different transducer sites indicated the ability for fluid flow behind the cup, which can be related in vivo to the movement of particulate debris to periacetabular bone. The APTR was able to measure clinically significant pressures and to analyse the effects of modifying component and loading characteristics with currently available prosthetic components. This makes the rig useful in a clinical context, as it {{has been shown to be}} capable of testing a broad range of component types under a wide range of conditions. Its use will ensure new prostheses and fixation modes can be designed in such a way as to eliminate the damaging fluid pressures currently observed in artificial hip joint replacements...|$|E

Then, an attempt is made to obtain an approximate relation to find the minimum requiring preload to preserve the system's antibacklash property and reduce friction and wear on the gear teeth. The mesh stiffness of the mated gears, rack, and pinion is achieved via finite element method.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{particular}} context of cultural heritage, protective glazing {{has been the}} subject of only few studies [1 - 2]. In addition to the monitoring of temperature, humidity and light in museums, the conditions of conservation for the preservation of cultural heritage, needs the development of a low cost glass with specific properties. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is one of the most widely used compounds in the manufacture of organic glasses. Indeed it has a refractive index (n = 1. 491) close to that of glass (n = 1. 522), it has a better light transmission and is much lighter and less brittle than glass. Therefore it has been widely applied in conservation for the glassing of artifacts and especially during travelling exhibitions. PMMA is also still used by many artists to produce artworks such as Diasec© (a popular face mounting techniques for photographs), 3 D objects and design furnitures. Unfortunately PMMA is very sensitive to abrasion and after a few years this might alter the visual appearance of the artifact. This work shows the possibility to enhance anti-scratch and solvents resistance of PMMA based glass by combining it with polycarbonate (PCR 39 ®) inside Interpenetrating Polymer Network (IPN) architecture. Our specifications require a transparent final material and a preparation without solvent in order to address specific issue of the cultural heritage preservation community. These IPNs are synthesized according to an in situ process. According to the chosen free-radical initiators, the PMMA network is formed in the first place followed by the synthesis of PCR 39 ® network. <b>Rigid</b> transparent (<b>transmission</b> higher than 95 %) materials are obtained.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{investigate}} the differences without/with respiratory motion correction in apparent imaging agent localization induced in reconstructed emission images when the attenuation maps used for attenuation correction (from CT) are misaligned {{with the patient}} anatomy during emission imaging {{due to differences in}} respiratory state. METHODS: We investigated use of attenuation maps acquired at different states of a 2 cm amplitude respiratory cycle (at end-expiration, at end-inspiration, the center map, the average transmission map, and a large breath-hold beyond range of respiration during emission imaging) to correct for attenuation in MLEM reconstruction for several anatomical variants of the NCAT phantom which included both with and without non-rigid motion between heart and sub-diaphragmatic regions (such as liver, kidneys etc). We tested these cases with and without emission motion correction and attenuation map alignment/non-alignment. RESULTS: For the NCAT default male anatomy the false count-reduction due to breathing was largely removed upon emission motion correction for the large majority of the cases. Exceptions (for the default male) were for the cases when using the large-breathhold end-inspiration map (TI_EXT), when we used the end-expiration (TE) map, and to a smaller extent, the end-inspiration map (TI). However moving the attenuation maps rigidly to align the heart region, reduced the remaining count-reduction artifacts. For the female patient count-reduction remained post motion correction using rigid map-alignment due to the breast soft-tissue misalignment. Quantitatively, after the <b>transmission</b> (<b>rigid)</b> alignment correction, the polar-map 17 -segment RMS error with respect to the reference (motion-less case) reduced by 46. 5 % on average for the extreme breathhold case. The reductions were 40. 8 % for end-expiration map and 31. 9 % for end-inspiration cases on the average, comparable to the semi-ideal case where each state uses its own attenuation map for correction. CONCLUSIONS: Two main conclusions are that even rigid emission motion correction to rigidly align the heart region to the attenuation map helps in average cases to reduce the count-reduction artifacts and secondly, within the limits of the study (ex. rigid correction) when there is lung tissue inferior to the heart as with the NCAT phantom employed in this study endexpiration maps (TE) might best be avoided as they may create more artifacts than the end-inspiration (TI) maps...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a procedure {{for evaluating the}} Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral and presents applications of it which involve the interpretation of amplitude and travel time anomalies of body waves. The method of integration is a summation of single point evaluations of the integrand and requires that spacing of these evaluations on the surface be small compared to the wavelength of the incident disturbance. The technique predicts amplitudes, travel times and waveforms of acoustic potentials that propagate through a homogeneous medium and interact with three-dimensional curved boundaries. Results from test models compare well with optical solutions for reflections off planar interfaces and <b>rigid</b> spheres and <b>transmissions</b> through planar interfaces. The reflected integral solution is used to simulate the effect of an idealized mountain on the amplitude and waveforms on pP. This structure causes multiple arrivals, phase shifts, and amplitude anomalies in the synthetic reflection profile. Also the effects of spall on pP waves generated by explosions are simulated by specifying position dependent reflection coefficient {{on the surface of}} integration. These experiments predict frequency dependent amplitude anomalies and travel time delays of the reflections. The transmitted solution is used to model the effect of several idealized crust-mantle boundary structures on teleseismic P waves generated by explosions. The structures are upwarps and product travel time residuals as a function of delta and azimuth which have the same magnitude as residuals observed for NTS tests within Pahute Mesa. The structure causes early complicated low amplitude waveforms and late simple high amplitude waveforms. Thus they cause systematic amplitude variations with azimuth, delta, and source location. The magnitude of predicted variation is less than the observed ab amplitude variation with azimuth of Pahute Mesa tests; however, it is approximately the same as the observed ab variation at a given station as a function of test location within the mesa. The integral method is extended to include a symmetric velocity function in the medium and is used to model ScS waves which propagate through a JB Earth and reflect off a bumpy core-mantle boundary. Solutions with this extension establish that isovelocity Kirchhoff solutions are sufficient to predict the relative amplitude and travel time anomalies of ScS arising from core-mantle boundary relief. Isovelocity modeling shows that upwarps 300 to 600 kilometers wide and at least 10 kilometers high cause precursors to ScS and amplitude reductions of the same magnitude as the observations. However, the height is not mechanically feasible; therefore, the anomalous observations must originate elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} novel microfabrication approach and testing methodology for cylindrical ion trap (CIT) microarray tunable for mass- spectrometers. The {{growing interest in}} cylindrical ion trap (CIT) mass-spectrometers is primarily due to ease with which cylindrical geometry can be realized as compared to hyperbolic surfaces found in conventional quadrupole ion traps. Also {{due to the fact}} that the potential at the center of hyperbolic electrode in quadrupole ion trap and cylindrical electrode in cylindrical ion trap (CIT) does not differ significantly[2]. Since the RF voltage required to eject a given mass-to-charge ion scales as the square of the ion trap radius, a decrease in ion trap dimensions provides a significant reduction in electronics requirements, thereby providing a pathway for overall system miniaturization. The reduction in sensitivity due to reduced ion storage capacity as a result of miniaturization can be improved by employing an array of identically sized ion traps. Microfabrication approach promises excellent uniformity in the fabrication of identically sized holes which in turn leads to low-cost high performance CIT microarray for mass spectrometers[1, 2]. The criterion used for the determination of trap diameter was to ensure that the hole to be 1. 09 times the wafer thickness to provide optimal potential to trap ions[1]. The end- plates were designed to optimize the electron and ion transmission into and out of the ion trap and provide a high quality electric field definition within each cylindrical ion trap (CIT) [3]. Two different approaches, namely deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and mechanical drilling using ultrasonic disc cutter were proposed and used for the fabrication of ring-electrode which forms the main body of the ion trap. Excellent uniformity in hole diameter was observed in both the approaches. The end-plates were fabricated using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) which provided high <b>transmission</b> <b>rigid</b> grid structure for ions and electrons. Standard Bosch process was used for deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). The two electrodes were metallized using electroless plating which provides excellent uniformity of coating even on end-plate structures with 5 micro m through holes. CYTOP[trademark], a cyclized perfluoro polymer, was used as an insulation layer and intermediate bonding layer between the ring electrode and end-plates. The breakdown voltage for a released 16 micro m thick CYTOP[trademark] layer was found to be 1. 47 KV. An assembly for testing miniature cylindrical ion trap (CIT) was designed and built.
