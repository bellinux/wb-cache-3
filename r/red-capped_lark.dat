5000|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark</b> was {{originally}} {{placed in the}} genus Alauda. Alternate names for the <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark</b> include rufous short-toed lark and short-toed lark, although the former may also describe the Somali short-toed lark and the latter is also used as an alternate name for three other species in the genus Calandrella. Formerly, some authorities considered both the Mongolian short-toed lark (as C. c. dukhunensis) and Erlanger's lark (as C. c. erlangeri or C. c. ruficeps) to be subspecies of the <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark</b> [...] Additionally, some authorities considered the <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark</b> itself to be ether conspecific with or as a subspecies of the greater short-toed lark.|$|E
50|$|Blanford's lark was {{formerly}} included {{in either the}} greater short-toed lark (C. brachydactyla) or the <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark</b> (C. cinerea) but is now commonly treated as a separate species.

40|$|Microbial {{invasion}} of egg contents {{is a cause}} of embryonic death. To counter infection risks, the embryo is protected physically by the eggshell and chemically by antimicrobial proteins. If microbial pressure drives embryo mortality, then females may have evolved, through natural selection, to adapt their immune investment into eggs. Although frequently hypothesized, this match between immune allocation and microorganisms has not been explored yet. To examine if correlations between microbes on eggs and immunity in eggs exist, we collected eggs from <b>red-capped</b> <b>larks</b> (Calandrella cinerea) and simultaneously examined their bacterial communities and antimicrobial components [...] pH, lysozyme and ovotransferrin [...] during natural incubation. Using molecular techniques, we find that bacterial communities are highly dynamic: bacterial abundance increases from the onset to late incubation, Shannon's α-diversity index increases during early incubation stages, and β-diversity analysis shows that communities from 1 day-old clutches are phylogenetically more similar to each other than the older ones. Regarding the antimicrobials, we notice a decrease of pH and lysozyme concentration, while ovotransferrin concentration increases during incubation. Interestingly, we show that two eggs of the same clutch share equivalent immune protection, independent of clutch age. Lastly, our results provide limited evidence of significant correlation between antimicrobial compounds and bacterial communities. Our study examined simultaneously, {{for the first time}} in a wild bird, the dynamics of bacterial communities present on eggshells and of albumen-associated antimicrobial components during incubation and investigated their relationship. However, the link between microorganisms and immunity of eggs remains to be elucidated further. Identifying invading microbes and their roles in embryo mortality, as well as understanding the role of the eggshell microbiome, might be key to better understand avian strategies of immune maternal investment...|$|R
5000|$|Rufous short-toed lark, {{alternate}} {{name for}} <b>Red-capped</b> <b>lark</b> (Calandrella cinerea), found in {{eastern and southern}} Africa ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark</b> forages on {{bare ground}} or in very short grass, moving with short runs {{to feed on}} seeds and insects. It is {{sometimes}} found in flocks which can number hundreds of birds.|$|E
50|$|The {{call of the}} <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark</b> is a tshwerp like a sparrow, and the song, {{given in}} the display flight, is a jumble of melodious phrases treee, treee, tip-tip, tippy, tippy tippy. It also imitates other birds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark,</b> Calandrella cinerea, {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird. This lark breeds in {{the highlands}} of eastern Africa southwards from Ethiopia and northern Somalia. In the south, its range stretches across the continent to Angola and south to the Cape in South Africa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark</b> breeds {{all year}} round, but mainly from September to December. The nest is a deep, open cup {{which is set}} {{into the ground and}} usually {{situated}} close to a grass tuft, stone or mound. The nest is lined with fine grass and rootlets.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark</b> is a 14- to 15-cm-long bird, with a {{typically}} upright stance. The colour of the streaked grey to brown upperparts is variable, with subspecies differing in hue and brightness, but this species is easily identified by its rufous cap, white underparts, and red shoulders. The short head crest is normally not noticeable {{except when it}} is raised during courtship displays.|$|E
5000|$|The Somali {{short-toed lark}} was {{originally}} {{placed in the}} genus Calandrella until moved to Alaudala in 2014. Formerly or presently, some authorities considered the Somali short-toed lark as a subspecies of the lesser short-toed lark and/or the Athi short-toed lark as a subspecies of the Somali short-toed lark. The alternate name rufous short-toed lark {{is also used to}} describe the <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark.</b>|$|E
50|$|The greater {{short-toed lark}} was {{originally}} {{placed in the}} genus Alauda. The alternate name short-toed lark may {{also be used for}} three other species in the genus Calandrella. The Mongolian short-toed lark was formerly considered as a subspecies of the greater short-toed lark (as C. b. dukhunensis) until split in 2016 by the IOC. Formerly, some authorities also considered the <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark</b> to be either conspecific (as C. cinerea) with or a subspecies (as C. b. cinerea) of the greater short-toed lark.|$|E
50|$|Blanford's lark is 14 - 15 {{centimetres}} long. The upperparts are pale sandy-brown {{with some}} darker streaking and the crown is rufous. The underparts are pale and plain {{apart from a}} small dark patch {{on the side of}} the neck made up of vertical streaks. The greater short-toed lark is similar but has a greyer, more-streaked crown. Erlanger's and red-capped larks have darker upperparts with more streaking and a darker rufous crown. Erlanger's lark has larger dark neck-patches while in <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark</b> the patches are rufous.|$|E
50|$|The Mongolian {{short-toed lark}} was {{originally}} {{placed in the}} genus Alauda. It was then considered as a subspecies of the morphologically similar greater short-toed lark, but recent analyses of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA showed {{that it was more}} closely related to Hume's short-toed lark. It was split in 2016 by the IOC, although not all other authorities have recognized this re-classification to date. Additionally, some authorities considered the Mongolian short-toed lark to be a subspecies of the <b>red-capped</b> <b>lark.</b> The name 'Mongolian short-toed lark' is also used as an alternate name for the Asian short-toed lark. The alternate name short-toed lark may also be used for three other species in the genus Calandrella.|$|E
40|$|Background: Variation {{in growth}} and immune {{function}} within and among populations is {{often associated with}} specific environmental conditions. We compared growth and immune function in nestlings of year-round breeding equatorial <b>Red-capped</b> <b>Lark</b> Calandrella cinerea from South Kinangop, North Kinangop and Kedong (Kenya), three locations that are geographically close but climatically distinct. In addition, we studied growth and immune function of lark nestlings as a function of year-round variation in breeding intensity and rain within one location. We monitored mass, wing, and tarsus at hatching (day 1) and at 4, 7, and 10 days post-hatch, and we quantified four indices of immune function (haptoglobin, agglutination, lysis and nitric oxide) using blood samples collected on day 10. Results: Nestling body mass and size at hatching, which presumably reflect the resources that females allocated to their eggs, were lowest in the most arid location, Kedong. Contrary to our predictions, nestlings in Kedong grew faster than nestlings in the two other cooler and wetter locations of South and North Kinangop. During periods of peak reproduction within Kedong, nestlings were heavier at hatching, but they did not grow faster over the first 10 days post-hatch. In contrast, rainfall, which did not relate to timing of breeding, had no effect on hatching mass, but more rain did coincide with faster growth post-hatch. Finally, we found no significant differences in nestling immune function, neither among locations nor with the year-round variation within Kedong. Conclusion: Based on these results, we hypothesize that female body condition determines nestling mass and size at hatching, but other independent environmental conditions subsequently shape nestling growth. Overall, our results suggest that environmental conditions related to food availability for nestlings are relatively unimportant to the timing of breeding in equatorial regions, while these same conditions do have consequences for nestling size and growth. </p...|$|E
40|$|Timing of {{reproduction}} in birds {{is important for}} reproductive success and is known to depend on environmental cues such as day length and food availability. However, in equatorial regions, where day length is nearly constant, other factors such as rainfall and temperature are thought to determine timing {{of reproduction}}. Rainfall can vary at small spatial and temporal scales, providing a highly fluctuating and unpredictable environmental cue. In this study we investigated {{the extent to which}} spatio-temporal variation in environmental conditions can explain the timing of breeding of <b>Red-capped</b> <b>Lark,</b> Calandrella cinerea, a species that is capable of reproducing during every month of the year in our equatorial east African study locations. For 39 months in three climatically-distinct locations, we monitored nesting activities, sampled ground and flying invertebrates, and quantified rainfall, maximum (T max) and minimum (T min) temperatures. Among locations we found that lower rainfall and higher temperatures did not coincide with lower invertebrate biomasses and decreased nesting activities, as predicted. Within locations, we found that rainfall, T max, and T min varied unpredictably among months and years. The only consistent annually recurring observations in all locations were that January and February had low rainfall, high T max, and low T min. Ground and flying invertebrate biomasses varied unpredictably among months and years, but invertebrates were captured in all months in all locations. Red-capped Larks bred in all calendar months overall but not in every month in every year in every location. Using model selection, we found no clear support for any relationship between the environmental variables and breeding in any of the three locations. Contrary to popular understanding, this study suggests that rainfall and invertebrate biomass as proxy for food do not influence breeding in equatorial Larks. Instead, we propose that factors such as nest predation, female protein reserves, and competition are more important in environments where weather and food meet minimum requirements for breeding during most of the year. </p...|$|E
