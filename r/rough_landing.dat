5|$|Kenney {{remained}} {{for a time}} with the Allied occupation forces in Germany, and was promoted to captain on 18 March 1919. He returned to the United States in June 1919. He was sent to Kelly Field, near San Antonio, Texas, and then to McAllen, Texas. As commander of the 8th Aero Squadron, he flew reconnaissance missions {{along the border with}} Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. Poor aircraft maintenance, <b>rough</b> <b>landing</b> strips and bad weather led to the squadron losing 22 of its 24 Airco DH.4 aircraft in just one year.|$|E
5|$|Buck makes a <b>rough</b> <b>landing</b> {{after the}} drop and fights through Covenant forces to find Dare. He finds Romeo instead, {{and the two}} resolve to find the others {{and get out of}} the city. Dutch drops near a nature {{preserve}} and helps Marines fighting there. Mickey commandeers a tank and fights his way along a Mombasa boulevard. Meeting up with Dutch, the two defend an ONI base from the Covenant, destroying the facility to keep it from being captured. They are evacuated by a transport and make contact with Buck, arranging a rendezvous at police headquarters, but are shot down. Buck and Romeo rescue Dutch and Mickey, but Romeo is seriously wounded. The squad hijacks a Covenant dropship, but instead of leaving the city, Buck decides to have them turn back and find Dare.|$|E
5|$|Although {{considered}} an average pilot at best by his instructors, Ball qualified for his Royal Aero Club certificate (no.1898) on 15 October 1915, and promptly requested {{transfer to the}} Royal Flying Corps (RFC). He was seconded to No.9 (Reserve) Squadron RFC on 23 October, and trained at Mousehold Heath aerodrome near Norwich. In {{the first week of}} December, he soloed in a Maurice Farman Longhorn after standing duty all night, and his touchdown was rough. When his instructor commented sarcastically on the landing, Ball angrily exclaimed that he had only 15 minutes experience in the plane, and that if this was the best instruction he was going to get, he would rather return to his old unit. The instructor relented, and Ball then soloed again and landed successfully in five consecutive flights. His <b>rough</b> <b>landing</b> was not the last Ball was involved in; he survived two others. He completed his training at Central Flying School, Upavon, and was awarded his wings on 22 January 1916. A week later, he was officially transferred from the North Midlands Cyclist Company to the RFC as a pilot.|$|E
50|$|The Kapilikaya Rock Tomb {{is located}} in Kırkdilim, 27 km north of Çorum, Turkey, on a rocky, steep and <b>rough</b> <b>land</b> formed by rift valleys cracked by river, on the north- west corner of a rock which extends toward north.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s and '30s, {{many of the}} area's {{houses were}} shotgun-style homes that {{contained}} no indoor plumbing and had rental rates ranging from $1.25 to $2.50 per week. The homes were built on <b>rough</b> <b>land</b> surrounded by unpaved streets and sidewalks.|$|R
5000|$|Nobody was {{immediately}} {{interested in the}} land where the golf course is now. <b>Rough</b> <b>land</b> with too many trees was not suitable for farming. Some people sold trees for lumber if a mill was located nearby. Most people acquired remote lands for selling later.|$|R
5|$|McKay initiates an anti-Replicator {{field to}} protect them from the Asurans, but Oberoth (David Ogden Stiers) discovers this and sends a wave to {{override}} the field. Weir leaves McKay, confronts Oberoth and uses his power to freeze all the Asurans, even tricking him into believing that he has captured the team, all to buy Sheppard enough time to upload the programme. However, Weir struggles to keep Asurans frozen, and when Sheppard finds her just as she loses control, she orders him to leave her behind as the Asurans unfreeze and capture her. The team escapes without Weir, but end up trapped as they lack the power to make it to hyperspace. They are unexpectedly assisted by the Apollo, who have found Atlantis with Colonel Carter's (Amanda Tapping) help. The Apollo lays down covering fire long enough for the team to land in the fighter bay and carries them back to Atlantis. However, the Apollo is unable to lock onto Doctor Weir and beam her aboard. Now fully powered, Sheppard sends the city to M35-117, a back-up planet, and makes a <b>rough</b> <b>landing</b> onto its ocean. Whilst the team mourns the loss of Weir, McKay regains contact with Stargate Command. Dr. Zelenka (David Nykl) announces that the Asurans have begun their attack against the Wraith, meaning Weir's sacrifice was not in vain. Carter tells Sheppard that they will miss Weir, though Sheppard vows to find her again.|$|E
25|$|The grass {{landing field}} at Hapupu, at the {{northern}} end of the Island, proved a limiting factor, as few aircraft apart from the Bristol Freighter had both the range to fly to the islands and the ruggedness to land on the grass airstrip. Although other aircraft did use the landing field occasionally, they would often require repairs to fix damage resulting from the <b>rough</b> <b>landing.</b> Hapupu is also the site of the JM Barker (Hapupu) National Historic Reserve (one of only two in New Zealand) where there are momori rakau (Moriori tree carvings).|$|E
25|$|Following graduation, Macpherson {{applied for}} a {{teaching}} fellowship at Washington State College in Pullman, Washington. American entry into World War II, which had erupted the previous autumn, was clearly on the horizon, however. Rather than {{face the prospect of}} entry into the conflict as a 2nd Lieutenant of the infantry, Macpherson instead chose to enlist in the Army Air Corps. He trained as a pilot at the new Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Maria, California, but was scrubbed from the pilot program following a <b>rough</b> <b>landing</b> during training. He was instead stationed as a 2nd Lieutenant of the Army Air Corps at Albrook Field, located near Panama City, Panama, where he was placed in charge of the base photo laboratory.|$|E
50|$|Around 1830, a {{group of}} {{settlers}} composed of Irish and French Canadians, began clearing the <b>rough</b> <b>land</b> with difficulty. In 1845, the Gore Municipality was established, which included the Gore and Wentworth Townships, but it was abolished two years later. In 1855, the Wentworth Township Municipality was formed.|$|R
50|$|Rural uses {{were also}} {{subdivided}} using patterns: Market gardening into 10 categories ranging from 'field vegetables' to 'orchards with market gardening' and arable into 6 categories ranging from cereals to fallow. Heath, moorland and <b>rough</b> <b>land</b> (yellow wash) was overprinted {{with one or}} more of 16 symbols to indicate vegetation types.|$|R
50|$|Kiyozaemon died in 1907, {{creating}} {{the opportunity for}} Yasujirō to break free. In 1909, he mortgaged the family estate for 5000 yen. With this money, he married Nishizawa Koto and had a daughter, Shukuko, in 1909, then attended Waseda University investing in <b>rough</b> <b>land</b> and businesses. At the time, however, <b>rough</b> <b>land</b> had little value and was looked upon as a foolish investment. Still, Yasujirō persisted. In 1917, he purchased 650 acre of land for 30,000 yen from a village near the fashionable mountain resort of Karuizawa, and built several vacation houses and cottages. With this, he established a company, Hakone Resorts Ltd. Japan had prospered greatly during the First World War, initiating a period of prosperity and democracy {{the likes of which}} Japan had never experienced before. Yasujirō's wealth and empire expanded proportionally with this boom. Customers came, and by 1923, Hakone Resorts Ltd had a value of 20,000,000 yen.|$|R
25|$|Development stalled after {{a flight}} test by Lützow Holm, {{commander}} of the Karljohansvern base. After a <b>rough</b> <b>landing,</b> following drastic and hazardous flying, he demanded that the design be revised to strengthen it before entering production. The construction yard opposed this, {{pointing out that the}} design was already 10% stronger than had been specified by the Navy. While the dispute continued, the M.F.12 was grounded at Karljohansvern. In June 1939, shortly before the M.F.12 took to the air for the first time, the Norwegian Ministry of Defence set down a joint military and civilian commission to decide on a new common trainer for both the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service, its Army cousin; the Norwegian Army Air Service, and the civilian air schools. Further work on the M.F.12 was put on hold while the commission worked on its report. Before any conclusion could be made, the Germans invaded Norway on 9 April 1940.|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "Grasshopper" [...] {{was given}} to the Aeronca L-3 and Piper L-4 light aircraft, both used for {{reconnaissance}} and other support duties in World War II. The name is said to have originated when Major General Innis P. Swift saw a Piper making a <b>rough</b> <b>landing</b> and remarked that it looked like a [...] "damned grasshopper" [...] for its bouncing progress.|$|E

25|$|Amerigo Vespucci {{may have}} sighted South Georgia {{during one of}} his voyages. While sailing in the South Atlantic to 52° south {{latitude}} (Vespucci's own estimate), in April 1502 they allegedly encountered a high, gloomy and <b>rough</b> <b>land</b> where human life was rendered impossible by severe cold ― a description seemingly fitting South Georgia. However, this potential encounter is refuted by analysis of Vespucci's records.|$|R

2500|$|Finally, {{the descent}} was begun and it {{proceeded}} normally. At {{an altitude of}} [...] the crew began releasing scientific instruments that would descend by their own parachutes. This was done to protect the data in case the gondola had a <b>rough</b> <b>landing.</b> The precautions proved unnecessary as the balloon landed gently in an open field {{near the town of}} White Lake, South Dakota at 4:13 pm.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was almost}} {{certainly}} during this final stage in his pursuit of May that a single [...]303 bullet hit Richthofen, damaging his heart and lungs so severely {{that it must have}} caused a quick death. In the last seconds of his life, he managed to retain sufficient control to make a <b>rough</b> <b>landing</b> (...) in a field on a hill near the Bray-Corbie road, just north of the village of Vaux-sur-Somme, in a sector controlled by the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). [...] There were several witnesses, including Gunner Ernest W. Twycross, Gunner George Ridgway, and Sergeant Ted Smout of the Australian Medical Corps. Each of these men later claimed to have been the first to reach the triplane, and each reported various versions of Richthofen's last words, generally including the word [...] "kaputt".|$|E

2500|$|In July 1945, a PBY Catalina Dumbo {{aircraft}} helped rescue distressed crewmen of the torpedoed cruiser USS Indianapolis. Airmen dropped rafts and supplies, but {{noticed that}} some of the more than 300 men in the water were being attacked by sharks. The pilot, Lieutenant Adrian Marks, defied regulations forbidding him to land in heavy seas and brought his flying boat to a <b>rough</b> <b>landing</b> amid [...] swells. He and his crew filled the fuselage with sailors, then began using parachute cord to lash more survivors {{to the top of the}} aircraft's wing, damaging it severely. With the arrival of the destroyer USS Cecil J. Doyle, Marks and his crew were rescued along with the 56 sailors they saved. The unflyable Catalina was sunk by gunnery from the Doyle the next morning. Marks was later awarded the Air Medal for this heroic action.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first flight}} of the Baddeck No. 1 {{successfully}} took place at Petawawa on 11 August 1909. A distance of 100 metres was achieved but engine problems resulted in curtailing further flights that day. On the next day, the second flight [...] was short in duration and ended in a <b>rough</b> <b>landing</b> that damaged a wing and the landing gear. Military officials were not impressed and the Baddeck No. 1 was shipped back to Baddeck. After being repaired, and with new coil springs on the undercarriage, the installation of [...] "between-the-wings" [...] ailerons, an added biplane tail and the cambered front elevators replaced by flat ones, the aircraft continued to fly {{in a series of}} proving flights at Bentick Farm in Baddeck. After the loss of the AEA Silver Dart and the major damage to the Baddeck No. 1, Baddeck No. 2, essentially a copy of the earlier aircraft, was assembled in Baddeck.|$|E
