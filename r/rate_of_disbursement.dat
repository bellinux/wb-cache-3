2500|$|Reconstruction {{efforts have}} been plagued by poor management, {{mishandling}} of reconstruction funds, inadequate coordination with Iraqis and widespread attacks on construction sites and contractors as documented by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR). In October, 2004, the U.S. Congress created SIGIR which is charged with oversight of the use and potential misuse of the IRRF. The SIGIR conducts audits, investigations and inspections and issues quarterly reports to Congress. [...] The SIGIR reports and U.S. Congressional testimony of Stuart Bowen, the Inspector General, are a primary source {{of information on the}} overall status of U.S. funded Iraq reconstruction. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>disbursement</b> of funds administered by the United Nations and World Bank has been slow. [...] Iraqi agencies and ministries are often unable to receive or process funds. [...] Many United Nations agencies have had great difficulty operating in Iraq due to the poor security situation.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss aid and the {{environment}} in Ghana. Our analysis indicates that expenditure {{by the government of}} Ghana has increased consistently since 2000, with seven sectors weakly linked to the environment taking about 78. 9 per cent of all government expenditure. Also, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> increase of environmental expenditures has not kept pace with overall expenditure. External aid disbursement to environmental sectors has expanded and efforts are being made by the development partners to steer more grants instead of loans to environment-related activities. A 19 -sector analysis of data from the AidData dataset from 1993 to 2009 indicates that the environmental sector ranks 11 th in terms of project numbers, commitments and disbursements. A worrying phenomenon is the average <b>disbursement</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 27. 8 per cent which is lower than the average <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>disbursements</b> for all the 19 sectors (29 per cent), indicating the poor implementation of environmental projects. Also, cross-cutting issues such as climate change, biodiversity and desertification appear to be important only for the environmental sectors even though some of these, such as education, can be used to combat environmental degradation. Poor commitment of aid to the environmental sectors reflects the views of the development partners that the non-environmental sectors require more aid than the environmental sectors, even though donors recognize that non-environmental sectors have environmental impacts and are addressing them in their activities...|$|R

The study was undertaken to study growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> loan <b>disbursement</b> between MFI-Bank Linkage and SHG-Bank Linkage in India and to study growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> loan outstanding between MFI-Bank Linkage and SHG-Bank Linkage in India. The present study is based on secondary sources of data. The study makes use of statistics such as arithmetic mean, standard deviation, co-efficient of variation and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to analyze the data. Non parametric test viz. Man-Whitney U test has been used to draw inference on the framed hypotheses. It was observed that the CAGR of amount of loan disbursed to MFI during the period from 2007 - 08 to 2015 - 16 is 33. 56 percent while the CAGR of total amount of loan disbursed to SHGs in India for the same period is 17. 33 percent.

40|$|Abstract Background An {{accurate}} {{forecast of}} global demand {{is essential to}} stabilize the market for artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and to ensure access to high-quality, life-saving medications at the lowest sustainable prices by avoiding underproduction and excessive overproduction, each of which can have negative consequences for the availability of affordable drugs. A robust forecast requires {{an understanding of the}} resources available to support procurement of these relatively expensive antimalarials, in particular from the Global Fund, at present the single largest source of ACT funding. Methods Predictive regression models estimating the timing and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>disbursements</b> from the Global Fund to recipient countries for each malaria grant were derived using a repeated split-sample procedure intended to avoid over-fitting. Predictions were compared against actual disbursements in a group of validation grants, and forecasts of ACT procurement extrapolated from disbursement predictions were evaluated against actual procurement in two sub-Saharan countries. Results Quarterly forecasts were correlated highly with actual smoothed disbursement rates (r = 0. 987, p Conclusion This analysis derived predictive regression models that successfully forecasted disbursement patterning for individual Global Fund malaria grants. These results indicate the utility of this approach for demand forecasting of ACT and, potentially, for other commodities procured using funding from the Global Fund. Further validation using data from other countries in different regions and environments will be necessary to confirm its generalizability. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which aid disbursement delays could be used as an indicator of the aid unpredictability and absorptive capacity in recipient countries. Since many recipient countries are dependent on aid, disbursement delays might matter for its effectiveness. The emphasis is put on the so-called pipeline approach, according to which, in the short run, disbursement constraints may lead to huge delays and weak <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> aid <b>disbursement</b> relative to commitments. After the literature review on disbursement delays, we use the framework of programmable aid to run some econometric estimations through a dynamic model, an ARDL, for a panel of 48 African countries during the period of 1975 â€“ 2008. We find disbursement constraints mainly at the short-run level, while the main donor's specific factors seem to be the selectivity and the degree <b>of</b> aid fragmentation. <b>Disbursement</b> <b>rates</b> and rhythms are also influenced by the economic performance and governance quality of the recipient countries and the share of grants in aid modalities. Bilateral donors are found to under-perform in comparison with multilateral donors in terms of the rhythm <b>of</b> aid <b>disbursement.</b> Foreign aid, absorptive capacity, disbursement delays, panel ARDL...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a stochastic {{framework for the}} analysis of transactions and precautionary demand for money. The analysis is based on the principles of inventory managements and the key feature of the model is its stochastic characteristics which lead to the need for precautionary reserves. The formal solution for optimal money holdings is derived and is shown to depend on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> interest, the mean <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> net <b>disbursements,</b> the cost <b>of</b> portfolio adjustment and the variance of the stochastic process governing net disbursements. One solution is obtained by minimizing the present value of financial management. This solution is compared with an alternative that is derived from the more conventional methodology of minimizing the steady-state cost function. The comparison shows that the two approaches may yield solutions that differ significantly from each other. The paper concludes with an application of the model to an empirical examination of countries' holdings of international reserves. The empirical results are shown to be consistent with the predictions of the model. ...|$|R

Chapter one also gives brief information about the relation of Sudan with the World Bank. Chapter two focuses {{on the steps of the}} World Bank projects, which should be prepared and provided by the Borrowerâ€™s Countries to the World Bank to have loans. Chapter two also discusses the financing of the projects by the World Bank and the procedure of signing the loan agreements.
