5|$|Following the Florida State kickoff, Virginia Tech {{attempted}} to answer Florida State's kick-return touchdown {{with one of}} its own. Kendrick fielded the ball at the Virginia Tech goal line and returned it 63 yards, {{all the way to}} the Florida State 37-yard line, where the Hokie offense began work. Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a first down. Tech kicker Shayne Graham was sent into the game, seemingly to attempt a 51-yard field goal. Instead of kicking the ball, Graham {{attempted to}} <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> for a first down. Graham fumbled short of the first down, and Florida State took over on offense with 9:43 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} night the New York Mets were coming from behind to defeat the Boston Red Sox in Game 7 of the 1986 World Series, the Giants {{defeated}} the Redskins 27–20 in week eight to improve to 6–2 and move into a tie with the Redskins for the division lead. With the teams tied 20–20, Joe Morris scored the game-winning touchdown on a 13-yard run with 98 seconds remaining. The Giants offense featured a two tight end formation {{throughout much of the}} game which allowed them to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> more effectively. The Giants used Mark Bavaro and Zeke Mowatt throughout much of the game, sometimes even lining them up on the same side. Morris finished the game with 181yards. Redskins quarterback Jay Schroeder threw for 420yards in the loss.|$|E
5|$|Oxendine {{accounted}} {{for the majority of}} Virginia Tech's 193 total rushing yards, but Nebraska had many more players <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> than just Benning, who {{accounted for}} just over one-third of Nebraska's 279-yard rushing total. Scott Frost carried the ball nine times for 62 yards and two touchdowns for the Cornhuskers, and Ahman Green, despite being hampered by his injured foot, managed seven carries for 52 yards. All told, seven Nebraska players managed to carry the ball at least once. Virginia Tech, on the other hand, saw just four players carry the ball, and its No. 2 rusher, Marcus Parker, had eight carries for 22 yards.|$|E

5|$|After the Kansas kickoff, Virginia Tech {{took over}} at its 33-yard line. Needing a score, the Hokies {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty before quarterback Sean Glennon was sacked by Kansas' Mike Rivera. The two plays pushed the Virginia Tech offense back, {{preventing them from}} gaining a first down. Forced to punt the ball away, Virginia Tech had to play defense as Kansas took over at its 28-yard line. Secure in their lead, Kansas elected to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{in an effort to}} keep the clock moving and bring the game to an end more quickly. Brandon McAnderson broke free for 28yards on the first play of the drive, and Jake Sharp contributed another first down on the ground before the Hokie defense stopped Kansas on an attempt to earn a first down on a fourth-and-two deep inside Virginia Tech territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with NC State in {{possession}} of the ball at their 40-yard line and facing a second down and one yard. On the first play of the quarter, NC State quarterback Erik Kramer ran the ball, but fumbled {{at the end of}} the <b>run.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> was recovered by Virginia Tech, and the Hokie offense took the field. The first Virginia Tech play of the quarter was a first-down throw to David Everett that drove the Hokies into Wolfpack territory. Tech followed the pass by driving down the field with alternating run and pass plays. Tech penetrated the NC State 20-yard line with 12minutes remaining in the quarter, and continued to drive. Once the Hokies crossed the State 10-yard line, the State defense stiffened and the Hokies were able to gain a first down only with difficulty. With a first down at the State seven-yard line, it took Tech just twoplays to earn a touchdown. The Hokies again attempted a two-point conversion, but were again stopped short. Despite that setback, the touchdown gave Tech six points and a 2221 lead, their first since the 8:55 mark in the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|The Outlaws were {{competitive}} {{for much}} {{of the first half of}} the season, starting out 6-2 off the strength of Williams' arm. Unfortunately, the team could not consistently <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> (The Outlaws finished with a league worst total of 1537 total rushing yards --- almost 200yards less than the 17th ranked team.) Two blowout losses sent the team into a downward spiral. They did not win another game that season, dropping 10 straight to finish 6-12.|$|E
50|$|In Week 2, Forsett <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> 15 {{times for}} 68 {{yards in a}} 37-33 loss to the Oakland Raiders.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} game of the 2009 season, against San Diego, Higgins <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> one time for 19 yards.|$|R
50|$|That joy {{was short}} lived though as <b>the</b> Cheetahs <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> 68 {{yards from the}} {{kick-off}} return to score a touchdown.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} to a hit-up is for the player in the acting-halfback position to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> himself, without passing. This is often performed by quicker players as {{they are able to}} round the markers and make ground for their side. Some teams use repeated dummy-half scoots with the intention of playing the ball quickly and catching defenders before they are able to properly position themselves. This is known as quick ball or 'getting a roll on'.|$|E
25|$|The Giants had {{the wind}} {{again in the}} third quarter, and on their first drive of the second half, Hampton scored on a 51-yard rushing touchdown, the longest run in Giants postseason history. Then Harry Newsome's punt went just 21 yards to the Minnesota 26-yard line. Hampton {{subsequently}} converted a fourth and 1 situation with a 2-yard run and rushed for five yards on third and 2 as the team drove to another touchdown on his 2-yard score. On the extra point attempt, the snap sailed right through Horan's hands and went right {{into the arms of}} Treadwell. However, Treadwell managed to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into the end zone for a successful conversion, giving the team a 17-10 lead.|$|E
25|$|WVU {{entered the}} game against Pitt as 28 point {{favorites}} {{to win the}} 100th Backyard Brawl and earn a berth in the BCS championship game. The Mountaineers, however, could never get their high-powered offense going against the Panthers and were hurt by fumbles, missed field goals, and ineffective performances by Steve Slaton and Pat White, the latter of whom missed {{part of the game}} with a thumb injury. Pittsburgh, starting their backup QB Pat Bostick, was equally ineffective at moving the ball outside of the play of LeSean McCoy. Trailing by one possession late in the fourth quarter, West Virginia twice had the ball in Pitt territory, with both drives ending in Pat White being stopped on downs. The final Pitt possession saw the Panthers <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{out of the back of}} the end zone for a safety as the clock expired, ending WVU's National Championship hopes.|$|E
50|$|In 74 {{games for}} Kansas City, Pitts caught 78 passes for 11 touchdowns and <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> 24 times for 238 yards and one touchdown.|$|R
50|$|A bye will {{count as}} one <b>run</b> if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> bowled hits a wall. A leg bye will count as one <b>run</b> if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> hits a side wall after {{deflecting}} off the batsman's pads or body.|$|R
50|$|Matthews scored {{his first}} career {{touchdown}} during a Monday Night Football game on October 5, 2009 against the Minnesota Vikings; Matthews stripped <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> from running back Adrian Peterson and <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{back for a}} touchdown.|$|R
25|$|Another {{occurrence}} capped Kansas State's 38–35 comeback victory November 21, 2015, over Iowa State. Kansas State had rallied from a 35–14 halftime {{deficit to}} pull to within one touchdown. With 1:31 left, Iowa State having possession on first {{down and the}} Wildcats having just one time out remaining, the Cyclones chose instead to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> before fumbling the ball away; Kansas State would tie the game on the ensuing possession. On Iowa State's next series, starting with 50 seconds remaining, the Cyclones again chose to run a play rather than take a knee and send the game into overtime, but quarterback Joel Lanning was sacked on second down and lost possession of the ball, ultimately leading to a game-winning field goal by the Wildcats. Iowa State coach Paul Rhoads' play-calling in the final 90 seconds of the game, {{the culmination of a}} difficult 2015 season for ISU, ultimately led to his firing.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Elway's {{completions}} to Steve Sewell and Steve Watson for gains of 39 and 21 yards propelled the team on {{a drive to}} the Patriots 4-yard line. From there, Elway tried to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> for a score, but was tackled {{just short of the}} end zone. Believing he had crossed the plain, Elway angrily spiked the ball into the ground, drawing a penalty that pushed the team back five yards and they ended up having to settle for Rich Karlis' field goal to go up 3-0. In the second quarter, the Patriots took the lead when Eason completed a 19-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Stanley Morgan to cap an 87-yard drive. However, the Broncos countered with an 82-yard drive to score on Elway's 22-yard touchdown run. Later in the second quarter, New England linebacker Johnny Rembert's interception of an Elway pass on the Broncos 29-yard line led to Tony Franklin's 38-yard field goal, tying the game at 10 {{by the end of the}} half.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} week of play, LSU {{traveled}} to Ladd Stadium in Mobile, Alabama and defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide, 13–3 in coach Bear Bryant's first game with the team. Paul Dietzel had previously served as an assistant coach for Bryant during his tenure at Kentucky. Neither teams' defense allowed a score in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Cannon fumbled at Alabama's 45-yard line, and Duff Morrison picked it up for the Tide and returned it to the LSU 5-yard line. Here, the Chinese Bandits had the first of their famous goal-line stands, and held Alabama to a field goal. Alabama's defensive line and linebackers made it difficult for LSU to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in the first half, and they also put pressure on Rabb during passing plays. The Crimson Tide went into halftime with a 3–0 lead. Midway through the half, a section of bleachers in the north end zone collapsed and resulted in 60 spectators being injured. The collapse caused a stoppage of play while emergency responders worked to assist those injured by the collapse.|$|E

5000|$|From the restart {{kick-off}} Belcher fielded <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in his in-goal but was penalised for shepherding behind Chris O'Sullivan as he <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> out. It {{was a gift}} {{penalty for}} O'Connor to take Manly out to an 8-0 lead.|$|R
50|$|The next week, Forsett <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> 21 {{times for}} 121 {{yards and scored}} a touchdown, as well as {{catching}} four passes for 49 yards, but the Ravens lost to the Cleveland Browns.|$|R
25|$|The {{team won}} their first game in 1953, against Murray State, and lost the {{rest for a}} record of 1–7. One {{of the most memorable}} games of the season came in a 59–6 loss against Tennessee. Unitas {{completed}} 9 of 19 passes for 73 yards, rushed 9 times for 52 yards, returned 6 kickoffs for eighty-five yards, 1 punt for three yards, and had 86 percent of the team's tackles. The only touchdown the team scored was in the fourth quarter when Unitas made a fake pitch to the running back and ran the ball 23 yards for a touchdown. Unitas was hurt later in the fourth quarter while trying to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> On his way off the field, he received a standing ovation. When he got to the locker room he was so worn that his jersey and shoulder pads had to be cut off because he could not lift his arms. Louisville ended the season with a 20–13 loss to Eastern Kentucky. In his junior year, Unitas completed 49 of 95 passes for 470 yards and three touchdowns.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{going to}} the playoffs from 1979 through 1982 and playing in two AFC Championship Games, the Chargers never went to the Super Bowl under Fouts (although they went 7 years after his retirement). Usually this is {{attributed}} to poor defense and their unwillingness to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> In Fouts's prime the defense was not as stellar, but the running game became far better {{with the addition of}} Chuck Muncie, traded from New Orleans in 1980, and the drafting of James Brooks from Auburn in 1981. It is believed the defense had little opportunity to improve as the offense often scored quickly, leaving the defense to spend far too much time on the field. It also hurt that Fred Dean, an All-Pro sack specialist, was traded away to the San Francisco 49ers in 1981 in a contract dispute, and Dean would win UPI NFC Defensive Player of the Year (while playing in only 11 games) that year en route to a Super Bowl victory and help the 49ers to another Super Bowl title three years later. Dean would later be inducted into the Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|In April 1976, Spurrier {{was sent}} to the {{expansion}} Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for two players and a second round draft pick as part of the new franchise's first trade. The Buccaneers' new acquisition generated local excitement, as Spurrier had been a college star at the nearby University of Florida. He won the job as team's first starting quarterback, a position that he later regretted as the undermanned Bucs went on to suffer the first winless season (0-14) in modern NFL history. Though he had looked forward to playing professional football in Florida, Spurrier was frustrated by losing, the constant hits playing behind a porous offensive line, and his philosophical differences with Bucs coach John McKay. McKay insisted on employing a run-heavy attack similar to the offense he had used to win championships at The University of Southern California, while Spurrier felt that the team did not have the right personnel to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> effectively and should open up the offense. Another point of contention was Coach McKay's insistence that his son, John McKay, Jr., be the Buc's primary wide receiver while Spurrier and other observers felt {{that he did not have}} the talent to fill that role.|$|E
50|$|As {{a rookie}} in 2003, Smith rushed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> 107 times for 579 yards and five touchdowns. The next season, he <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> 144 times for 544 {{yards and two}} touchdowns, which led the Vikings who had injury {{problems}} at running back.|$|R
50|$|Played {{sparingly}} in {{his second}} season at Louisiana Tech. He played in five games throughout the season passing for 142 yards on 14 completions. He also <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> 5 times for 20 yards.|$|R
5|$|The Hokies {{took over}} at their 39-yard line, and {{immediately}} found success. Randall connected on two 10-yard passes {{to take the}} Hokies into Air Force territory. The two passes were followed by a 16-yard run by Tech fullback Doug Easlick for another first down at the Air Force 24-yard line. From there, the Tech ground game continued to eat up yards and result in first downs. Kevin Jones <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> twice for 11yards, then Lee Suggs <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> three times for 13yards, the last carry also resulting in a touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point gave Tech its first lead of the game, 17–10, with 4:45 remaining.|$|R
500|$|About Maryland, Nevada {{head coach}} Chris Ault said, [...] "Their offense {{to me is}} very balanced. They can <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and do a good job. With [...] Turner, they split out and they have some nice receivers. Whereas Missouri was going to throw {{it as much as}} Texas Tech did, I think Maryland is {{probably}} one of the more balanced teams we've played this year." ...|$|E
500|$|Among his Maryland {{teammates}} and coaches, Turner {{earned a reputation}} as an archetypal [...] "laid-back" [...] Californian and for remaining calm under pressure. After the 2007 win over Rutgers, offensive tackle Scott Burley described his roommate Turner as [...] "real calm ... He would say, 'Guys, are you ready to score again? Are you ready to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on these guys?' And we're like, 'Yeah, let's do that.'" [...] Turner received the nicknames [...] "Sunshine" [...] and [...] "Napoleon Dynamite", in reference to his similar appearance to the fictional characters in the films Remember the Titans and Napoleon Dynamite, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Pittsburgh {{opened their}} {{pre-season}} schedule with a 16–10 {{victory over the}} Philadelphia Eagles. The Steelers scored on their first possession, after driving 80yards on eight plays. Ben Roethlisberger's 19-yard touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes completed the drive. In the first quarter, Charlie Batch {{was removed from the}} game after breaking his clavicle. Jeff Reed converted three field goals from 20, 24, and 50yards. Toronto's Rogers Centre hosted the second pre-season game; it was the first pre-season game Pittsburgh played in Toronto since 1960. Pittsburgh's starting offense played longer in the second game. Willie Parker increased his output over the first game by playing on third downs. However, the team failed <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> consistently and struggled on defense, losing the game 24–21. [...] "We fell short essentially in all three phases," [...] stated coach Tomlin after the game.|$|E
25|$|Patriots QB Tom Brady {{finished}} the game 22 of 33 for 265 {{yards and three}} touchdowns, running back Corey Dillon <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> for 40 yards on 12 carries, and Edgerrin James <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> for 104 yards on 34 carries. The Colts had two receivers top 100 yards receiving, Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne, {{and both of them}} had nine receptions each. On the very last play of the game, Colts DE Robert Mathis recorded a sack to keep his streak alive at eight straight games with at least one sack. Through week 9, the Colts were the only undefeated team in the league.|$|R
5000|$|QB-Frankie Guerra of the Wolverines {{took the}} snap on first down and <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to <b>the</b> Renegade 16-yard line. The next Wolverine play was a {{completion}} to old reliable #6 WR-Damien Alston. The catch got the Wolverines to the 5-yard line. The next play was a dump off to Wolverine #5 RB-Phil Barron aka [...] "Super stud". Phil <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> aggressively to <b>the</b> 1-yard line while {{picking up a}} first down. The next play went to #7 WR/RB-Andrea Chillers on a sweep play. The result was the third Wolverine score (the extra point was missed) The score was now 20 - 0 with 2 {{minutes left in the}} half.|$|R
