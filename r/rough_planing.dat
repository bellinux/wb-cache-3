40|$|Fully {{developed}} turbulent {{flows in}} six square ducts consisting of smooth and <b>rough</b> <b>planes</b> were experimentally investigated {{by measuring the}} velocity profiles in a cross section, the pressure gradient along the duct and the wall shear stress distributions on smooth planes which were measured {{by means of a}} Preston tube. It was shown that the pattern of the constant velocity contour lines and the wall shear stress distributions across a plane were strongly influenced by the variation of surface condition of the four planes forming the duct. The contribution of each wall plane of a duct to the total flow resistance of the duct was investigated and it was revealed that the degree of the contribution of a plane changed considerably by the arrangement of the surrounding wall planes as well as the number of <b>rough</b> <b>planes</b> forming the duct. Based on these results equations for practical use were proposed to predict the mean flow resistance coefficient of the flow in the square ducts consisting of smooth and <b>rough</b> <b>planes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fast {{mapping of}} roads plays an {{important}} role in many geospatial applications, such as infrastructure planning, traffic monitoring, and driver assistance. How to extract various road edges fast and robustly is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a fast and robust algorithm for the automatic road edges extraction from terrestrial mobile LiDAR data. The algorithm is based on a key observation: most roads around edges have difference in elevation and road edges with pavement are seen in two different planes. In our algorithm, we firstly extract a <b>rough</b> <b>plane</b> based on RANSAC algorithm, and then multiple refined planes which only contains pavement are extracted from the <b>rough</b> <b>plane.</b> The road edges are extracted based on these refined planes. In practice, there is a serious problem that the <b>rough</b> and refined <b>planes</b> usually extracted badly due to rough roads and different density of point cloud. To eliminate the influence of rough roads, the technology which is similar with the difference of DSM (digital surface model) and DTM (digital terrain model) is used, and we also propose a method which adjust the point clouds to a similar density to eliminate the influence of different density. Experiments show the validities of the proposed method with multiple datasets (e. g. urban road, highway, and some rural road). We use the same parameters through the experiments and our algorithm can achieve real-time processing speeds...|$|R

A classification of frictional contacts {{with respect to}} their dimensionality, associativity, and the possibility of interruptions is proposed and basic models showing typical features are stated. In particular, bifurcation conditions for equilibrium families are obtained and formulas for the monodromy matrix for systems with friction are constructed. It is shown that systems with non-associated contacts possess singularities that lead to the nonexistence or nonuniqueness of phase trajectories; these results generalize the paradoxes of Painleve and Jellett.

40|$|International audienceThe {{dynamics}} of a macroscopic grain rolling on an inclined plane composed of fixed identical grains is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. As real sand, the system exhibits an hysteretic transition between static and dynamical states: for angles smaller than d, the roller always stops, for angles larger than s, it spontaneously starts rolling down. But for angles between d and s, {{it can be}} either at rest or in motion with a constant velocity. It is shown that the limit velocity is given by the equilibrium between gravity driving and dissipation by the shocks. Moreover, the <b>rough</b> <b>plane</b> acts as a periodic potential trap whose width and depth decrease when the angle is increased: the static angle s corresponds to the angle for which the trap disappears; the dynamical angle d to that for which the limit velocity is sufficient {{to escape from the}} trap.

The limit cycles made of two alternate asperity failures, which are observed in the case of purely elastic coupling, are no longer produced. The model is applied to the 1964 Alaska earthquake, which was the effect of the failure of two asperities and for which a remarkable post-seismic relaxation has been observed in the subsequent decades.

40|$|The laws of {{friction}} are reasonably well understood {{for the case}} of blocks in contact with <b>rough</b> <b>plane</b> surfaces. However, as far as bodies with circular sections are concerned, the physics {{of friction}} becomes more involving {{and it is not}} possible to adopt a simple conceptual framework to explain all phenomena.

Our approach furnishes a quantitative expression for the critical force beyond which rest can no longer be maintained. Besides confirming the expected proportionality of the resistance force with the load, our result contains no free parameters and is expressed solely in terms of physical properties of the problem, such as the pressure of the body per unit of superficial area, a relation between the Young modulus of the surface and its Poisson ratio, and the symmetry of the contact.

This behavior is observed for four planes with different bump sizes (given {{by the size of the}} beads glued on the plane) from 200 microns to 2 mm. The relative roughness corresponding to the maximum of the friction can be predicted with a geometrical model of stability of one single bead on the plane.
