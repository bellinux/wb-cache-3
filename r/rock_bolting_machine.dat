30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, the prestress of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> {{is one of}} the key {{parameters for}} bolting, and plays a decisive role on the effect of anchor support. The previous studies show that the anchor prestress should reach a level of 30  %– 50  % of anchor yield strength.

With the roadway support of the 2302 working face of a coal mine as the project background, this paper carries out a study on the effect of two schemes, increasing the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> diameter and the double supporting technique through methods of theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and so on.

The coupling mechanism of <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> and <b>rock</b> mass is discussed {{from the viewpoint of}} displacement. A simple method is suggested for the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> design in tunneling. According to the analysis, displacement of rock mass controls the initial force in rock mass. Case simulations confirm the previous findings that a bolt in-situ has a pick-up length, an anchor length and at least one neutral point. The theoretical prediction of single <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> agrees with the measured data. The position of the neutral point is not only related to the length of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> and the internal radius of the tunnel, but is also strongly influenced by the properties of rock mass.

The pre-load on a <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> {{plays an important role}} in the structural reinforcement and it is vital to monitor the pre-load status of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts.</b> In this paper, a <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> pre-load monitoring method based on the piezoceramic enabled time reversal method is proposed. A lead zirconate titanate (PZT) patch transducer, which works as an actuator to generate stress waves, is bonded onto the anchor plate of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt.</b> A smart washer, which is fabricated by sandwiching a PZT patch between two metal rings, is installed between the hex nut and the anchor plate along the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt.</b> The smart washer functions as a sensor to detect the stress wave.

With the help of time reversal technique, experimental results reveal that the magnitude of focused signal clearly increases with the increase of the pre-load on a <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> before the saturation which happens beyond a relatively high value of the pre-load. The proposed method provides an innovative and real time means to monitor the pre-load level of a <b>rock</b> <b>bolt.</b> By employing this method, the pre-load degradation process on a <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> can be clearly monitored.

With the degradation of <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> pre-stress, the frequency in the dominating peak of the real part of the electrical impedance signature increased. To quantify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a normalized root mean square deviation (RMSD) index was developed to evaluate the degradation level of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> pre-stress. The experimental results demonstrated that the normalized RMSD-based looseness index, which was computed from the impedance value detected by the “smart washer”, increased with loss of the pre-stress of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt.</b> Therefore, the proposed method can effectively detect the degradation of <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> pre-stress, as demonstrated by experiments...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{engineering}} accidents have demonstrated that the failures of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> are mainly induced by the corrosion of reinforcing steel bars. This study aims to investigate the effect of <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> corrosion on the system reliability of anchored rock slopes. A uniform corrosion model for <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> and its applicable environmental conditions are first examined based on systematical analysis of the existing corrosion models for reinforcing steel bars and the experiment data for <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> corrosion. Two failure modes related to <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> corrosion are determined. They are the yield failure mode of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> at free section and the bond failure mode at the bolt-grout interface, respectively. Then, the failure models of anchored rock slope corresponding to those of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> are established. A method for estimating the time-variant system reliability of rock slopes based on Monte Carlo simulation is presented. Consequently, an example of anchored rock slope with a single slip surface is presented {{to demonstrate the validity}} and capability of the proposed methods. The results indicate that the corrosion model proposed by K. A. T. Vu and M. G.

The <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> corrosion at free section has a more significant influence on the stability of rock slopes at the early stage, whereas the effect of <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> corrosion at anchored section becomes more obvious at the later stage. Moreover, the variations in the anchored force of each <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> and the system probability of slope failure at the later stage are more significant than those at the early stage.

30|$|There {{are many}} {{theoretical}} analysis, experimental research, and engineering applications regarding the non-destructive detecting of the anchorage quality of conventional <b>rock</b> <b>bolts.</b> The Gendynamik AB Company proposed the non-destructive detecting instrument for <b>rock</b> <b>bolts.</b> This instrument detects {{the loss of}} ultrasonic energy to determine the defect length of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts.</b> However, the ultrasonic energy decays quickly along the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt.</b> Furthermore, the operating process is complicated, requiring a high environment condition. Consequently, this method is not widely used [15]. Beard MD developed the GRANIT equipment, based on the ultrasonic wave propagation along the grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> after it is anchored. However, the numerical model is simple {{and there was a}} significant difference between experimental results and numerical results [16, 17]. In recent years, Madenga and Zou studied the influence of excitation frequency on <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> length and anchoring defect level based on theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experiments. The wave amplitude ratio was used to analyze the corresponding relationship of the excitation frequency and waveform character of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> with free length and grouted length [18 – 20]. Li et al. used the hammer impact method to study the length of the fully grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> and grout ratio, establishing the relationship between the grout ratio and waveform character [21]. Zhang et al. used the acoustic wave non-destructive detecting method. Specifically, statistics and regression analysis were adopted to study the grout ratio and waveform character [22]. Zhu et al. studied the grout ratio based on the waveform character of the high frequency of stress wave in the grouted length of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> [23]. Sun et al. conducted waveform analysis to study <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> with different defect lengths, based on the low strain and stress wave reflection method. Furthermore, several measuring points were set along the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt,</b> and wavelet transform was used to analyze the wave velocity in different anchoring media, acquiring accurate defect positions and <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> length [24].|$|R

To obtain the reinforcing effects that only the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> exerts, the elastic modulus of the model ground reinforced by the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> reinforcing the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> was derived by creating the model ground into a cantilever shape, excavating the bottom ground of the concrete block, and measuring the maximum deflection of the model ground.|$|R
30|$|With massive {{coal mines}} {{entering}} {{the stage of}} deep mining, many new issues come out and the reinforcement of soft surrounding rock mass of roadways {{is one of those}} problems. The main issues of reinforcing deep soft rock roadways include high field stress, high temperature, and high water content [1 – 4], thus lead to a loose and broken surrounding rock. Hollow grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> can be employed to improve the mechanical properties of the surrounding rock mass and also provide anchorage in soft rock roadways due to their convenience and fast installation. Hollow grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> has middle hollow tube design. The middle hollow tube of the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> is used as the high-pressure blast channel and grouting channel. Compared with conventional <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> with the same cross-section area, the hollow design can make the <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> have better stiffness and shear strength [5]. The external surface of this bolt has threads with large thread pitch. The thread structure is convenient for cutting and lengthening. Compared with smooth <b>rock</b> <b>bolts,</b> the bonding area between the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> and the grouting material is improved, and therefore, the load bearing capacity is improved. Several researches show that the anchorage quality of the grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> is influenced by shear stress on the interfaces between the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt,</b> the grout, and the surrounding rock mass [6 – 9]. The shear stress mainly relies on the mechanical property of the grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolt,</b> the bond on the interface, and the compaction rate of the surrounding rock mass after grouting [10]. Several researchers studied the anchorage quality based on theoretical analysis and physical research, providing basis and reference for the design of grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> [11, 12]. However, in engineering, detecting the anchorage quality still mainly relies on pullout tests [13]. The limits are that the examination area is narrow and it cannot reflect the whole anchorage quality of the rock mass. Furthermore, pullout tests can ruin the <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> system. The mining engineering aims at the digital mining and green mining in the future [14]. Non-destructive detecting technology has the advantages of intelligence, rapidness, and large area detecting. Therefore, this method can be used to study the anchorage quality of hollow grouted <b>rock</b> <b>bolts.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the mechanism of}} Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) {{and how it can}} cause premature failure of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts.</b> SCC occurs due to the progressive development and growth of cracks in the surface of a metal, and it is caused by the combined effects of stress and a corrosive environment affecting susceptible metals and alloys. It can occur in most metals including stainless steel. It is not a new phenomenon, but its effect on <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> has only been recognised recently. <b>Rock</b> <b>bolt</b> failures caused by SCC appear to be brittle failures which occur at less than the ultimate tensile strength of the bolt. In the mining industry, SCC failures of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> can occur a few months, or after many years of exposure to stress and a corrosive environment. If SCC of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> is suspected, then thl~ <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> should be examined by a metallurgist, and steps should be taken to reduce the problem. Considerable research in the past has shown that SCC is a complex phenomenon and no one mechanism can explain all cases of SCC failures.

In 1995, <b>rock</b> <b>bolted</b> gateroads accounted for only 15  % of total gateroads in Chinese coal mines. During 1996 – 1997, the Australian <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> technology was introduced, and additional researches and tests had been conducted based on the local geological and mining conditions, which obviously improved the level of <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> technology in China. The new technology, materials and methods, such as <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> made of deformed rebar with high strength and anchored with full-column resin, the dynamic bolting design method, and the pretensioned resin cables with small boreholes, were widely applied in some coal districts, good support performance and economic benefits had been achieved. To tackle the roadway support problems at depth and under complex conditions, the <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> technique with high pretension and extra high strength was developed since 2005, which can not only control the roadway deformation, but also greatly increase the roadway driving rate. The modern support design thought with high strength, high stiffness, high reliability and low density were realized. At present, <b>rock</b> <b>bolted</b> gateroads in state-owned medium-to-large coal mines accounts for about 70  %, even over 90  % in some coal districts, and <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> has been {{the first choice of}} roadway support forms in coal mines.|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> in {{the mining}} {{industry}} is a widely used approach for increasing mine stability. However, {{when compared to the}} automation industry, where the use of sensors and real-time monitoring of processes have evolved rapidly, the use <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> have not changed a lot during the last 100 years. What is missing are technologies for keeping installed <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> under real-time and online monitoring. One problem is that <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> can become damaged by seismic activities or movements within the rock, and thus lose their load bearing capacity. If that happens, the outer shell of a tunnel’s walls or ceiling can collapse, with disaster as a result. Therefore, there is a clear need for online and real-time monitoring solutions for strain and thereby stress, as well as seismic activity. In this paper, the current state of art in research around intelligent <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> is presented. An intelligent <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> is the combination of a traditional <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> with an Internet of Things device, i. e. a <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> with embedded sensors, actuators, processing capabilities and wireless communication. In the proposed architecture, every <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> has its own IPv 6 address and can establish a wireless mesh network in an ad-hoc manner. Bymeasuring strain and seismic activity and exposing the sensors in the form of services, large gains in terms of safety and efficiently can be achieved. A number of mining related activities such as stress on the <b>rock</b> <b>bolt</b> can be detected, falling rocks and the presence of mobile machinery can be observed. Since the network is based on standard communication protocols such as IPv 6, it is vital to add security mechanisms to prevent eavesdropping and tampering of data traffic. By utilizing the real-time monitoring capabilities of a network of Internet-connected intelligent <b>rock</b> <b>bolt,</b> it is possible to drastically improve monitoring of mining activities and thereby providing workers with a safer working environment.

30|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>bolting</b> {{mechanism}} {{is different from}} that of supports acting on the roadway surface. As rocks basically belong to non-continuum, the method used for continuum is not applicable in analyzing the functions of <b>rock</b> <b>bolting.</b> To fully exert the function of <b>rock</b> <b>bolts,</b> enough anchoring force is necessary, moreover, spreading the bolt resistance force into the rocks is also important. The non-continuous deformations, caused by separation, slip, fracture opening and new-born cracks, are the key factors to prevent the bolt resistance force from spreading into rocks. Lots of underground practices have shown that <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> should be installed with enough pretension as soon as the roadway is excavated, the initial separation of rocks can be restrained, and the bolting performance is best (Zhang and Gao 2004; Kang et al. 2007 a). However, if <b>rock</b> <b>bolts</b> are installed in broken and separated <b>rocks,</b> even the <b>bolts</b> were heavily loaded, the bolting performance is poor. Therefore, the bolting theory with high pretension and extra high strength was proposed (Kang et al. 2007 b, 2009 c), the cores of which emphasize the decisive roles of bolt pretension and its spreading into <b>rocks</b> on <b>bolting</b> performance. The <b>rock</b> <b>bolting</b> with high pretension and extra high strength can effectively reinforce roadways once for all without twice or more supporting.|$|R
