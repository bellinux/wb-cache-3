50|$|The High Street and {{adjacent}} Walnuts Shopping Centre contain {{a wide variety}} of high-street shops. There is a general market three days a week in front of Orpington College. A large Tesco supermarket opened in 2009 on the site of a former multi-storey car park. There are several restaurants in the town centre. A <b>restricted</b> <b>parking</b> <b>zone</b> was introduced into Orpington high street, which enabled the council to wipe away road markings indicating parking restrictions. By combining the lack of markings, with CCTV monitoring, the council has been able {{to reduce the amount of}} street clutter and improve the quality of the High Street environment.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process {{for the detection of}} motor vehicles and a device which is suitable for performing said process. The process and the device can be used in preference as an anti-theft device in multi-storey car parks in order to prevent the departure of motor vehicles which intend to exit with an object other than the parking ticket (or any other identifying object) with which they entered into the <b>restricted</b> area (<b>parking</b> <b>zone</b> or multi-storey car park). The invention is based on the problem of providing increased security for the motor vehicles parked in the car park area. It is intended to make a theft more difficult or even totally impossible. This is achieved by means of a process for the detection of motor vehicles (1, X), in particular at the exit from a secured or restricted area such as a <b>parking</b> <b>zone</b> or a multi-storey car park, by which the engine noise (M 1) of the vehicle (1) entering the area (v<-e) is detected (11 e) and stored (recorded) and that the stored engine noise (M 1) is compared with the engine noise (Mx) of a or the vehicle (X, 1) which supposedly (P, 13 a) coincides with the motor vehicle (1) whose engine noise (M 1) was recorded on entry (v<-e) and which is intending (P) to exit (v<-a) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel vehicle ad hoc network (VANET) {{based on an}} on-street parking system that exploits the concept of InfoStations (ISs) and context-aware systems to locate and reserve a parking space. All <b>parking</b> <b>zones</b> have an assigned IS that provides wireless coverage to that <b>parking</b> <b>zone.</b> Thus, the <b>parking</b> details are available over dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) via the IS. Vehicles can request and reserve a preferred parking space using wireless capabilities while still moving. Because <b>parking</b> <b>zones</b> are generally distributed according to street (area) names, the architecture in this paper recommends centralised IS, which monitors and controls the geographically intermittent area-wise <b>parking</b> <b>zones.</b> Keywords—VANET; Context-aware; InfoStation; On-street parking.

40|$|Possibility {{of parking}} {{plays a role}} in {{deciding}} where to go and the driver where to purchase goods and services. In sectors such as trade, hotels, catering, transport and storage is likely that some percentage of these drivers will form. The paper tries to explain whether the introduction of paid <b>parking</b> <b>zones</b> will affect the growth of businesses in these sectors since the introduction of paid <b>parking</b> <b>zones</b> receive visitors "theoretical" chance to park, compared to locations where paid <b>parking</b> <b>zones</b> are not. Work with the help of least-squares could not determine whether this hypothesis is true in parts of Prague 3 and 7, which introduced paid <b>parking</b> <b>zones</b> in 2008. The model appeared generally statistically insignificant, which can not be concluded whether the introduction of paid <b>parking</b> <b>zones</b> will lead to greater development of businesses in sectors such as trade, hotels, catering, transport and storage in the city of Prague 3 and...|$|R
30|$|The curb <b>parking</b> <b>zone</b> {{should be}} set in road {{segments}} without traffic congestion. If traffic congestion appears peak hours, the strategy of time limited parking at peak hours should be implemented in curb <b>parking</b> <b>zones.</b> This measure can reduce the influence of curb parking on traffic conflict and improve motor vehicle safety.|$|R
