500|$|Naturally {{occurring}} actinium {{is composed}} of two radioactive isotopes; [...] (from the <b>radioactive</b> <b>family</b> of [...] ) and [...] (a granddaughter of [...] ). [...] decays mainly as a beta emitter with a very small energy, but in 1.38% of cases it emits an alpha particle, so it can readily be identified through alpha spectrometry. Thirty-six radioisotopes have been identified, the most stable being [...] with a half-life of 21.772 years, [...] with a half-life of 10.0 days and [...] with a half-life of 29.37 hours. All remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 10 hours {{and the majority of}} them have half-lives shorter than one minute. The shortest-lived known isotope of actinium is [...] (half-life of 69 nanoseconds) which decays through alpha decay and electron capture. Actinium also has two known meta states. The most significant isotopes for chemistry are 225Ac, 227Ac, and 228Ac.|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{produced}} and identified two {{new series of}} alpha-particle emitting radioactive elements; one is a 'collateral' branch of the actinium (4 n + 3) <b>radioactive</b> <b>family</b> {{and the other is}} collateral to the thorium (4 n) family. The series are of considerable interest in that they are the first whose early members lie on the neutron deficient side of beta stability. They have been produced in high yield of irradiation of thorium with deuterons of energy about {sup 80 }Mev in the Berkeley 184 -inch cyclotron. So far as the present observations are concerned both of these series begin with isotopes of protactinium (atomic number 91), although progenitors with higher atomic numbers are to be expected and will possibly be produced and identified. These protactinium isotopes are Pa{sup 227 } and Pa{sup 228 } formed by d, 7 n and d, 6 n reactions respectively...|$|E
40|$|Disequilibrium {{existing}} {{within the}} uranium series <b>radioactive</b> <b>family</b> (the so called ‘U-Th’ or ‘ 230 Th’ method) {{can be used}} for chronological purposes in volcanic areas. It can be applied to volcanic rocks as well as to travertines connected to volcanic events, provided that the age of these materials (volcanics or travertines) is younger than ∼ 300 ka. Many problems, capable of seriously affecting the reliability of the method, arise. This paper is intended for people who deal with chronology in volcanic areas but lack the specific knowledge necessary to assess critically the dating procedures performed by scientists with different backgrounds. Direct dating of volcanics can be affected by (a) the similar and low partition coefficients for uranium and thorium shown by many major constituents of volcanic rocks, (b) the occlusion, within the major minerals, of minor ones particularly enriched in uranium and thorium, (c) uranium loss caused by alteration, (d) the various phases used to draw the isochrone being of different ages, (e) problems connected to isotopic homogeneity of magma. The main difficulties that arise when dating travertine derive from the presence of a non-carbonate phase containing 230 Th that has not been generated within the travertine post-depositionally. These troublesome occurrences are discussed and methods of assessing them are suggested...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{geochemistry}} of thorium isotopes in the hydrosphere, particularly in the ocean, a method has been worked out by which Th- 232 (thorium) λ, Th- 230 (ionium), Th- 228 (radiothorium), and Th- 227 (radioactinium) can be determined separately. Eight samples of 20 to 40 litres of sea-water, from 23 · 0 % to 34 · 97 %, salinity, were collected in November 1953, in the Skagerak and the Gullmarfjord (Sweden). Thorium was isolated by the following procedure: just after collection, the samples were brought to pH 2 and a given amount of Th- 234 (UX 1) was added as tracer. Thorium was first precipitated with Fe(OH) 3 as carrier. Further purification was obtained by ion-exchange column chromatography followed by solvent extraction; the final fraction was obtained as the citric complex, a form suitable to incorporation in the photographic emulsion. The total yield varied from 8 to 23 % according to the sample, {{as determined by the}} β-activity of the tracer. The various thorium isotopes were measured through their α-activity, using nuclear photographic emulsions, more precisely the double-emulsion technique. RdTh and RdAc both generate five-branched stars; more than 90 % of these originated from RdTh, as indicated by the length of the tracks: while Io and Th only yield single tracks of range 18 · 8 μ and 15 μ respectively in the emulsion. Most samples showed a much lower activity than expected; this did not make it possible to discriminate between Io and Th through the range distribution of their tracks, thus we could only ascertain upper limits of Io and Th concentrations. Average concentrations corresponding to a total volume of 140 litres of water are as follows (in grams per ml) : RdTh = (4. 0 ± 1. 4). 10 - 21 Th 4. We can only account for this surprising result by supposing that the excess RdTh results from an excess of its parent MsTh, (Ra- 228) brought in by rivers or redissolved from the sediments. Owing to the short half-life of both these nuclides, such a RdTh excess should be found only {{in the vicinity of the}} shore or the bottom. 4. (4) RRdAc/U- 235 < 0 · 1. More than 90 % of the RdAc from U- 235 in the ocean cannot be accounted for. Considering the short half-life of RdAc, this suggests that actinium or protactinium are precipitated with the sediments together with the Io. 5. (5) In both U- 238 and Th- 232 families, a radium isotope (Ra and MsTh) appears to be in excess over its parent thorium-isotope (Io and Th). The presence in the ocean of unsupported Ra(T = 1600 years) and MsTh (T = 6 · 7 years) is of great interest. A study of the distribution of these isotopes should yield valuable data on their diffusion rates and on deep currents. As far as radioactive geochemistry is concerned, the ocean is characterized by extremely low concentrations of nuclides of all three <b>radioactive</b> <b>families</b> and by the total disruption of the radioactive equilibrium in these families. A calculation of the geochemical balance of radioactive elements in the hydrosphere from the above data is given in the last part of the paper. © 1957.

50|$|Midtown High student Jessica Campbell goes {{to school}} with Peter Parker, on whom she has a crush and is present when he is bitten by the {{irradiated}} spider which gives him radioactive powers. Jessica's father receives tickets for Disney World from his boss Tony Stark. On the way home, their car collides with a military convoy carrying <b>radioactive</b> chemicals. Her <b>family</b> is killed, and she spends several months in a coma. Upon waking, she is placed in an orphanage and adopted by the Jones family. Jessica later discovers that her radiation exposure granted her super strength, limited invulnerability, and flight. Jessica's adoptive parents re-enroll her at Midtown High, where she is ostracized by her classmates, especially Flash Thompson. Peter Parker (who has since become Spider-Man) senses in Jessica a kindred spirit—someone who has also lost her family due to a tragic circumstance. Jessica mistakes his kind attention for pity and lashes out at him. She later witnesses a fight between Spider-Man and the villain Sandman in her school. This inspires her to use her abilities for positive ends.|$|R
40|$|Invited {{talk at the}} XXI International Baldin Seminar on High Energy Problems, Sept. 2012, JINR Dubna, Russia. 36 pages, 42 figuresThe hadron {{spectroscopy}} is studied {{through the}} use of fractals and discrete scale invariance (DSI) implying log-periodic corrections to continuous scaling. The masses of mesons and baryons, reported by the Particle Data Group (PDG), agree with (DSI), as well as the masses of exotic narrow mesons, baryons, and dibaryons. Two distributions are systematically studied: first the log of the masses versus the log of their rank, and also the successive mass ratios. Each fitted parameter of the second distributions, {{as a function of the}} hadronic masses, displays the same shape for all PDG hadronic families and species. The same parameters allow good fits for the narrow exotic mesons, baryons and dibaryons. When the successive mass ratios between different baryon families are constant, this property is not observed between different meson families. Such observation is studied within the double mass ratios eliminating the quark masses, but the difference between baryons and mesons is not understood. The fractal properties and discrete scale invariance model are also used to study nuclei yrast masses as well as excited nuclei level masses of some nuclei. Here also the good agreement between data and fractal property, allows to make some predictions for still unobserved nuclei masses. Fractal properties are also compared to several nuclei data such as : - atomic masses in several columns of the Mendeleev periodic table of elements, - masses of series following β^+ or β^- disintegrations, - one and two nucleon separation energies, - half-lives of some isotopes, - the four <b>radioactive</b> <b>family</b> periods. Finally, it is shown that the lepton, hadron, and boson masses can be presented in the same frame. This is also partially true for the coupling constants...|$|E
