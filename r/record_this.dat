5|$|Australia also {{competed in}} the most recent tournament in 2006. There they {{finished}} in 5th position, compiling a 3–4 <b>record.</b> <b>This</b> {{is likely to be the}} last edition of the tournament for the foreseeable future.|$|E
5|$|McCoy {{had another}} strong {{performance}} against in-state rival Texas A {{in the final}} game of the regular season. This is the longest running rivalry both schools and the biggest margin of victory {{in the history of the}} rivalry occurred when Texas beat A 48–0 in 1898. McCoy and the Longhorns nearly equaled that <b>record</b> <b>this</b> year by producing a 49–9 victory, the second-largest margin of victory for this rivalry series.|$|E

5|$|On August 13, {{against the}} Boston Red Sox, he allowed 10 {{runs in the}} first inning (a team <b>record).</b> <b>This</b> was the first time a major league pitcher gave up at least 12 runs without taking a loss since Gene Packard of the St. Louis Cardinals did it on August 3, 1918).|$|E
5|$|An {{injury to}} Bolt's {{hamstring}} in March 2014 {{caused him to}} miss nine weeks of training. Having recovered from surgery, Bolt competed in the 4 × 100 metres relay of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Not in peak form Bolt {{said that he was}} attending the Games for the fans and to show his progress since the injury. Bolt and his teammates won the 4 × 100 metres relay in 37.58 seconds – a Commonwealth Games <b>record.</b> <b>This</b> was the foremost competition of the year for Bolt, given no Olympics or World Championships in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{tentatively}} appointed club physiotherapist Bertie Mee {{as acting}} manager in 1966. With new assistant Don Howe and new {{players such as}} Bob McNab and George Graham, Mee led Arsenal to their first League Cup finals, in 1967–68 and 1968–69. Next season saw a breakthrough: Arsenal's first competitive European trophy, the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. And the season after, an even greater triumph: Arsenal's first League and FA Cup double, and a new champions of England <b>record.</b> <b>This</b> marked a premature high point of the decade; the Double-winning side was soon broken up {{and the rest of}} the decade was characterised by a series of near misses, starting with Arsenal finishing as FA Cup runners up in 1972, and First Division runners-up in 1972–73.|$|E

5|$|Bolt's {{personal}} best of 9.58 {{seconds in the}} 100 metres is the fastest ever run. Bolt also holds the second fastest time of 9.63 seconds, the current Olympic record, and set two previous world records in the event. Bolt's {{personal best}} of 19.19 s in the 200 metres is the world <b>record.</b> <b>This</b> was recorded at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in Berlin against a headwind of −0.3m/s. This performance broke his previous world record in the event, his 19.30 s clocking in winning the 2008 Olympic 200 metres title.|$|E
5|$|Fernández's {{rookie season}} has been {{considered}} historic as his 4.2 Wins Above Replacement places him in the Top 10 player seasons among those under 21 years old since 1900. Fernández's Adjusted ERA+ of 174 on the season also places him in the Top 10 all-time for pitchers {{under the age of}} 21, and he is only the fourth pitcher to <b>record</b> <b>this</b> feat in the past 100 years. His strikeout rate is the highest in his league, pacing the National League at 9.81 strikeouts per nine innings.|$|E
5|$|From {{the sixth}} century, Scotland {{experienced}} {{a process of}} Christianisation, traditionally seen as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries, including St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. However, Gilbert Markus highlights the fact that most of these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible in the historical <b>record.</b> <b>This</b> would have included trade, conquest and intermarriage.|$|E

5|$|Howard scored six {{touchdowns in}} the game. Cecil Duffee and Billy Dabbs scored on runs of 19 and 16-yards in the first quarter; Duffee scored on a 34-yard {{reception}} from Tris Mock in the second quarter; Stephenson scored on an eight-yard run in the third quarter; and Charley Spier scored on a 40-yard interception return in the fourth quarter. The only Alabama points of the contest came in the fourth quarter, down 35–0 when John Wade threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Barton Greer. Although not included as part of Alabama's all-time <b>record,</b> <b>this</b> is the only loss Alabama ever had against Howard.|$|E
5|$|In March 1989, he {{was sold}} to Hull City for £200,000 (at the time a Hull <b>record).</b> <b>This</b> move reunited him with manager Eddie Gray. Leeds spent the money they {{received}} {{from the sale of}} Swan on bringing Gordon Strachan in from Manchester United. Leeds would go on to win the league title in 1991–92 under Wilkinson, with Strachan playing a large part in the success. However Swan and Hull did not find success; Gray used Swan in defence, and lost his job in the summer following a run of just one win in twelve games.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, a new {{taxonomy}} of the Bivalvia {{was published in}} the journal Malacologia. In compiling this, the authors used a variety of phylogenetic information including molecular analysis, anatomical analysis, shell morphology and shell microstructure as well as bio-geographic, paleobiogeographic and stratigraphic information. In this classification 324 families are recognized as valid, 214 of which are known exclusively from fossils and 110 of which occur in the recent past, with or without a fossil <b>record.</b> <b>This</b> classification has since been adopted by WoRMS.|$|E

5|$|In {{the week}} {{where the first}} series of Red or Black? aired, ITV gained a much larger {{audience}} share than {{it had in the}} week directly previous, where it had been beaten by BBC One on six out of seven nights. Despite this, reviews of the first series were universally negative, and additional criticism was leveled at the show when it was discovered that Nathan Hageman, the first winner of the £1m prize, had a criminal record. The Sun began a campaign calling for Hageman to return the money, but he was eventually allowed to keep it. It did, however, lead to ITV dropping three other contestants from the show, with at least one withdrawn because of their criminal <b>record.</b> <b>This</b> was also {{a major factor in the}} pre-recording of series 2.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} {{season in the}} Mountain West, the Bulldogs became co-champions with a 7-1 conference <b>record.</b> <b>This</b> was the Bulldogs' first {{appearance}} in the Hawaii Bowl. Coming into the 2012 season, Bulldogs' coach Tim DeRuyter said that his team would challenge for a Mountain West Conference title. After making good on that promise, the Bulldogs attempted to achieve their first bowl victory since the 2007 Humanitarian Bowl. A victory in the Hawaii Bowl would have given Fresno State a 10-win season {{for the first time}} since 2001, when quarterback Derek Carr's older brother David was the Bulldogs' quarterback.|$|E
5|$|Rip King and Fritz Pollard {{were named}} first-team all APFA and Alf Cobb was named second-team all APFA by the Rock Island Argus. The Pros only allowed 7 points all season, {{which was the}} lowest among all APFA teams. The 1920 Akron Pros are {{considered}} the first team {{in the history of}} the APFA to have an undefeated <b>record.</b> <b>This</b> changed with the 1972 rule change, however. In 2005, Pollard became the only player from the 1920 Akron Pros to be elected into the Professional Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Seven still-standing club {{records were}} set this season, {{including}} three Football League records. One Football League record {{was for the}} fewest Football League goals conceded in a 46 match season – 26, just over one every two games. Just five of these were conceded at home, another Football League <b>record.</b> <b>This</b> was based upon 30 clean sheets, again a Football League record. They also recorded a club record low of three league defeats, and a club record home clean sheet streak of eleven matches, lasting from 7 September 1953 to 13 February 1954. Another club record was a streak of six away draws, lasting from 20 March to 26 April. They were undefeated at home all season, continuing a 42 match unbeaten run started on 8 November 1952, that would last until 18 September 1954.|$|E
5|$|The Jets {{opened their}} 2012 season against the Buffalo Bills with Sanchez {{completing}} 19 of his 27 passes for 266 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception in a 48–28 rout of the Bills. In the subsequent four games, Sanchez {{became the first}} quarterback since Stoney Case in 1999 to complete under 50% of his passes in four straight contests as the Jets fell to a 2–3 <b>record.</b> <b>This</b> prompted fierce criticism from {{the media and the}} fans in regards to Sanchez's continued accuracy issues and prompted calls for the promotion of Tim Tebow. Sanchez snapped this streak against the Indianapolis Colts on October 14, 2012 completing 11 of his 18 passes for 82 yards and throwing for 2 touchdowns in a 35–9 victory over Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|The season officially {{began on}} June1, 2005, and lasted until November30, {{although}} it effectively persisted into January2006 due to continued storm activity. A record twenty-eight tropical and subtropical storms formed, {{of which a}} record fifteen became hurricanes. Of these, a record-tying seven strengthened into major hurricanes, a record-tying five became Category4 hurricanes and a record four reached Category5 strength, the highest categorization for hurricanes on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Among these Category5 storms were hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, respectively the second costliest and the most intense (by lowest pressure) Atlantic hurricanes on <b>record.</b> <b>This</b> season was also notable because the list of storm names was used up and six Greek letter names had to be used.|$|E
