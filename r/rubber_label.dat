40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the fiber}} Bragg grating sensing principle, and {{according}} to the characteristics of asphalt pavements, two types of FBG sensors are designed. One type is rigid sensor packaged by steel casing which labeled as R-type, and the other one is flexible sensor packaged by <b>rubber</b> which <b>labeled</b> as F-type. Through the tests of sensing performance, high-temperature stability performance and low-temperature stability performance, a comprehensive analysis of the long-term service performance is obtained. Analysis show that both rigid and flexible packaing have sensitizing effect while flexible packaging is better. Both types of sensors have good high temperature stability and low temperature stability, while R-tpe is better than F-type...|$|R

5000|$|Despite warm {{critical}} {{reviews of}} the first two albums, neither achieved a great deal of commercial success.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} the adsorption of radioactive iodine-labeled compounds including 131 I-thyroxine, â€˜ 31 !-triiodothyronine, 131 I [...] insulin, â€˜ 311 -albu mm, 131 I-ribonuclease (1 - 6). It has also been reported that this adsorption can be prevented {{by the addition of}} small amounts of albumin or gelatin (2, 3, 6, 7). Adsorption of labeled albumin to polyethylene, siliconized glass, stainless steel, and <b>rubber</b> and of <b>labeled</b> insulin to polyethylene and siiconized glass has been described (2, 4). The increasing laboratory use of plastic containers for such solutions led to this study which compares the adsorption of 131 !-thyroxine to glass with adsorp lion to various plastic containers. The prevention of adsorption of 131 !-thyroxine by the addition of 0. 005 %- 0. 01 %albumin is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} Hedgehog Pie {{were in a}} loose {{collection}} of folk musicians in Newcastle-upon-Tyne from 1969. By 1971 it had solidified into {{two members of the}} Doonan Family Band, Mick Doonan (flute) and Phil Murray (bass), together with Jed Grimes (guitar) and Andy Seagroat (fiddle). This line-up acted as a backing group to Tony Capstick on his album His Round. In 1972 they added another Doonan Family Band member Stu Luckley (guitar and bass), plus his wife Margi Luckley (vocals) and Ian 'Walter' Fairburn (fiddle). Fairburn and Murray soon departed to join local band Jack the Lad, formed out of the split in Lindisfarne, and the group replaced them with Martin Jenkins (violin) from Dando Shaft. It seems to have been at this point that they adopted electric instruments. The reputation of Doonan and Jenkins probably helped them to secure them a contract with local <b>label</b> <b>Rubber</b> Records and it was this line-up that recorded the first album.|$|R
