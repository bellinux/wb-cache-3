500|$|The {{formation}} of the army {{was part of the}} French Directory's long term strategy to undermine Habsburg influence in the Holy Roman Empire, and, conversely, to strengthen French hegemony in central Europe after the wars of the First Coalition and the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797. [...] Despite the Treaty, Austria and France remained suspicious of each other's motives, and the purpose of the Army of the Observation was to watch for Austrian border transgressions. Understanding that the negotiations at the Congress of Rastatt were going no-where, the Army of Observation was instructed to cross the Rhine. [...] Once across the Rhine, the Army of the Danube, was to secure strategic positions in southwestern Germany (present day Baden-Württemberg) and engage Archduke Charles' Austrian army. [...] In the meantime, the Army of Helvetia, under command of André Masséna, would secure such strategic locations as St. Gotthard Pass, the Swiss Plateau, and upper <b>Rhine</b> <b>basin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Michael Heller {{says that}} {{the rise of the}} [...] "robber barons" [...] in medieval Germany {{was the result of the}} tragedy of the anticommons. Nobles {{commonly}} attempted to collect tolls on stretches of the Rhine passing by or through their fiefs, building towers alongside the river and stretching iron chains to prevent boats from carrying cargo up and down the river without paying a fee. Repeated attempts by the Holy Roman Empire, including several efforts over the centuries led by the Emperor himself, to regulate toll collection on the Rhine, but it was not until the establishment of the [...] "Rhine League" [...] of the Emperor, certain nobles, and certain clergy that the control of the [...] "robber barons" [...] over the Rhine was crushed by military force. River tolls on the Rhine, increasingly imposed by states rather than individual lords, remained a sticking point in relations and commerce in the <b>Rhine</b> <b>basin</b> until the establishment of the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine in 1815.|$|E

2500|$|In France, intellectuals, {{because they}} had a chance of being {{published}} and could call on their “audience” to purchase their books, were able to express themselves on the subject of captivity. Their message, which naturally was not representative of all prisoners’ experiences, took several forms. Gaston Riou developed European themes in 1928 in his best-known work, Europe, ma patrie. The rapprochement with Germany that he outlined remained solely cultural, indeed superficial. Jacques Rivière, a prisoner since 24 August 1914, took an entirely different approach, developed in L’Allemand: “I must confess frankly: a relationship is described here, rather than an objective, rather than an appearance [...] The subject of my book is Franco-German antagonism”. Rivière developed a theory of economic rapprochement that would find fruition after the next world war: “Forgetfulness will develop, in Germany and here, if we know to organise industrial unity in the <b>Rhine</b> <b>basin,</b> if we know to harmoniously regulate trade there [...] There is all the same, in our current occupation of the Ruhr, with whatever intensity it has borne the Franco-German crisis, the foreshadowing of an equilibrium and a possible harmony between the two countries”.|$|E

5000|$|The Fossa Carolina (or Karlsgraben in German) was a canal {{named after}} Charlemagne {{in what is}} today the German state of Bavaria, {{intended}} to connect the Swabian Rezat river to the Altmühl river (the <b>Rhine</b> <b>basin</b> to the Danube basin). It was created during the early Middle Ages, long before the Ludwig Canal and the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal.

50|$|Projects for {{connecting}} the Danube and <b>Rhine</b> <b>basins</b> by canal {{have a long}} history. In 793, the Emperor Charlemagne ordered {{the construction of a}} canal—the Fossa Carolina, or Karlsgraben—{{connecting the}} Schwäbische Rezat, a tributary of the Rednitz, to the Altmühl near Treuchtlingen. Between 1836 and 1846 the Ludwig Canal, or Ludwigskanal, named for King Ludwig I of Bavaria, was built between Bamberg and Kelheim. This canal had a narrow channel, with many locks, and a shortage of water in the peak section, so the operation of the waterway soon became uneconomic — especially given the rapidly advancing construction of the railway network in the southern German countryside. The canal finally was abandoned in 1950, after a decision was made to not repair damage it had suffered during World War II.|$|R

40|$|River basin {{management}} {{is faced with}} complex problems that are characterized by uncertainty and change. In transboundary river basins, historical, legal, and cultural differences add to the complexity. The literature on adaptive management gives several suggestions for handling this complexity. It recognizes the importance of management regimes as enabling or limiting adaptive management, {{but there is no}} comprehensive overview of regime features that support adaptive management. This paper presents such an overview, focused on transboundary river basin management. It inventories the features that have been claimed to be central to effective transboundary river basin management and refines them using adaptive management literature. It then collates these features into a framework describing actor networks, policy processes, information management, and legal and financial aspects. Subsequently, this framework is applied to the Orange and <b>Rhine</b> <b>basins.</b> The paper concludes that the framework provides a consistent and comprehensive perspective on transboundary river basin management regimes, and can be used for assessing their capacity to support adaptive management.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{an overview of}} the development of aqueous point source emission factors for cadmium in the <b>Rhine</b> River <b>basin</b> in the period 1970 - 1988. Based on these emission factors the aqueous emissions of cadmium for different industrial activities in the basin are calculated. For some activities defining emission factors does not make sense, since their cadmium emission is determined by e. g. ore or scrap purchase policy and not by the applied process technology. The overall cadmium emission to the Rhine and to its tributaries is compared with the point source component of in-basin cadmium monitoring data. The results show reasonable agreement. Further study is required to include hydrological characteristics in a tributary-Rhine model, in order to justify the comparison of monitoring data and emission estimates. In the table below, a summary of all the calculated point source emissions in time and per branch is given. A second table provides {{an overview of the}} development of emission factors for point source emissions in the <b>Rhine</b> River <b>basin</b> in time...|$|R

40|$|The REGFLUD-project, {{commissioned}} by Germany’s Federal Research Ministry (BMBF), addresses {{the problem of}} reducing diffuse pollution from agricultural production. The objective of the project is the development and application of multi-criteria scientific methods, which are able to predict diffuse pollution in river basins subject to economic feasibility and social acceptability. The selected river <b>basins</b> (Ems and <b>Rhine</b> <b>basins)</b> cover a variety of landscape units with different hydrological, hydrogeological and socio-economic characteristics. This paper focuses on {{the analysis of the}} effects of certain policy measures to reduce diffuse pollution by nitrogen. For this purpose a model system consisting of an agricultural sector model, a water balance model and a residence time/denitrification model was developed and applied. First results indicate a wide range of annual nitrogen surpluses for the rural areas between less than 10 kg N/ha up 200 kg N/ha or more depending on the type and intensity of farming. Compared to the level of nitrogen surpluses the level of nitrogen inputs into the surface waters is relatively moderate because of degradation processes during transport in soil and groundwater. Policy impact analysis for a nitrogen tax and a limitation of the livestock density stress the importance of regionally tailored measures...|$|R
