40|$|This {{report was}} made to help the {{landowner}} of Bricker Farms make decisions regarding the <b>replanting</b> <b>of</b> his <b>orchard.</b> The decisions {{that need to be}} made in this process include: which crop to plant, how to plant it, and how to improve the distribution uniformity of irrigation water on the orchard. The report does not give definitive final decisions, but presents viable options that the landowner can utilize when deciding. In addition to the options that are presented, the report offers suggestions to the landowner so that the replanting process is done properly in a timely and economically-friendly manner...|$|R

40|$|The {{study focused}} on changes of {{rhizosphere}} microbial communities in apple trees in long-term <b>replanted</b> <b>orchards</b> <b>of</b> Central Europe, aiming at developing cropping practices to mitigate replant problems. It started from the evidence of a previous study which showed that a slight modification of root-colonizing fungal communities was responsible for a great increase of plant growth in soil samples which had previously been subjected to a gamma-irradiation cycle (25 kGy for 8 h), as compared to that observed in the corresponding untreated native soils. The study was performed on rhizospheric soil from nine multi-generation apple orchards after a plant growth assay with M 9 rootstock plantlets. PCR-DGGE analysis of soil DNA was performed to evaluate fungal and bacterial communities in fallow and replanted soils, as well as corresponding gamma-irradiated samples. Findings showed that rhizospheric fungal and bacterial communities within apple orchards did not differ according to their position within the orchard; while, they showed {{a shift in the}} gamma-irradiated soils. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas tolasii, Pseudomonas spp. and Novosphingobium spp. were the bacteria which were mainly attributed to this change. A shifting in composition of Fusarium communities toward F. oxysporum and F. equiseti resulted the most linked to the changes at rhizosphere level after re-colonization; to the contrary, F. venenatum and F. venaceum, Truncatella sp. and Gibellulopsis sp., only occurred in native soils. Findings {{of this study suggest that}} disturbance events such as a gamma-irradiation can modify microbial communities in long-term apple orchards thus allowing a soil re-colonization suitable to increase soil suppressiveness...|$|R

40|$|Delayed {{plant disease}} {{mathematical}} models including continuous cultural control strategy and impulsive cultural control strategy are presented and investigated. Firstly, we consider continuous cultural control strategy in which continuous <b>replanting</b> <b>of</b> healthy plants is taken. The existence and local stability of disease-free equilibrium and positive equilibrium are studied {{by analyzing the}} associated characteristic transcendental equation. And then, plant disease model with impulsive <b>replanting</b> <b>of</b> healthy plants is also considered; the sufficient condition under which the infected plant-free periodic solution is globally attritive is obtained. Moreover, permanence {{of the system is}} studied. Some numerical simulations are also given to illustrate our results...|$|R
