40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} kinetics of {{a bubble}} population {{driven by a}} uniform production of gas in a yield-stress fluid matrix is investigated in this paper. The context concerns the long time swelling of bitumen drums in which radioactive salts have been dispersed (salts suspensions in a bitumen matrix). Radioactivity generates uniform volume production of hydrogen by <b>radiolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> chains. Since the production rate of gas occurs on very long time scales (more than a hundred years), one needs to develop theoretical models to predict the material swelling. It has been shown previously that bitumen is a yield stress fluid and that, {{in the case of}} a motionless population (no migration due to buoyancy), the yield stress disturbs the classical scenario of nucleation, bubble growth and Ostwald ripening observed in a Newtonian fluid. In the present work, we consider bubbles nucleation and migration due to buoyancy and we show that the yield stress causes delays in the evolution of a bubble population and that it consequently modifies the macroscopic swelling of the material into the drums...|$|E

Radioactivity generates uniform volume production of hydrogen by <b>radiolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> chains.

It has been shown in previous studies that bitumen is a yield stress fluid. Therefore, the present work proposes to study the influence of a yield stress and of the production rate of gas on the evolution kinetics of a bubbles population. Usually, in a non-yield stress fluid and without gas creation, a supersaturation of gas leads to a scenario of germination, bubble growth and Ostwald ripening (growth of large bubbles at the expense of smaller ones). Over long times, a self-similar distribution of large bubbles is selected, independent of the initial distribution of nuclei. In this work, it is shown that there exist conditions for which the yield stress competes with the kinetics of ripening and induces hysteresis phenomena on the kinetics of bubbles distribution. The coupled effect of gas production rate and yield stress on the final population is discussed...|$|E

The measurement was conducted in varying speed mode condition and the values of shear rate and shear stress were obtained. Figures  1 and 2 illustrate rheogram and shear rate behavior <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> sonicated under different frequencies and power inputs. The results showed that the viscosity for a given shear rate decreased in bitumen sonicated under different frequencies and power inputs. The decrease in viscosity during sonication treatment <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> can be attributed to higher disintegration of asphaltene flocs. There are studies reported the dependency <b>of</b> viscosity <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> upon its asphaltene content [12, 14, 15]. Hence, during the sonication treatment <b>of</b> <b>bitumen,</b> the dissolution <b>of</b> asphaltenic components occurs resulting in breakdown of asphaltene molecules to lighter molecules leading to decrease in viscosity in the medium. Argillier et al. [2] conducted a rheological study of several heavy oils and concluded that the asphaltene content was a controlling factor for viscosity. Hence, sonication treatment <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> under different sonication frequencies and power inputs decrease the asphaltene content <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> leading to higher viscosity change.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Water {{damage of}} asphalt {{concrete}} pavements {{has been one}} of the major distresses in highway engineering. Engineering experiences and research results indicate that this damage is due to the extortionate air voids <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> mixtures. Paranormal porosity of asphalt mixture is largely the result of the poor controlling of compact degree during paving process. The quality of asphalt pavement is subjected to the controlling methods <b>of</b> compacting <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> mixtures. Ultrasonic is an excellent method for non-destructive testing used in various engineering fields. It is also a potentially effective tool to be applied in the control and evaluation of the compaction quality <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> mixtures. This paper presents the results of a study aimed at the applicability of ultrasonic technology for evaluation of porosity and compaction quality <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> mixtures. It is shown that this technology, which has been successfully used for many years for evaluation of Portland concrete structures, might be used in asphalt pavement engineering to provide a simple, quick, and objective methodology for control and evaluation of the compact quality <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> mixtures. The results of laboratory testing demonstrate the potential of this technology...|$|R

As a developing nation durability and long term performance of roads are very much important to the country. In Sri Lanka flexible pavements are the frequently used for road construction. In flexible pavement bitumen and aggregate are the main ingredients for surface layer. The quality <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> for roads is assessed using penetration grading system which was initiated in early 19 th century. The quality <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> and the method <b>of</b> grading <b>bitumen</b> in Sri Lanka have made several discussions among the professionals because of the premature failures on some major roads. In this research twenty three bitumen samples were collected from various construction sites and tests were carried out to assess their quality. A sample of test reports issued by the bitumen suppliers were also taken in to consideration. Penetration test, Softening point test and Viscosity test were carried out using the collected samples. Penetration and Softening Point were assessed using the local bitumen specifications and viscosity was assessed based on the requirements of viscosity grading system. The Quality <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> was further analysed using the temperature susceptible measures such as Penetration Index, Viscosity Temperature Susceptibility and Pen-Vis Number.
