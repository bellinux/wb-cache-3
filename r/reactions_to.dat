5|$|In other areas, {{such as the}} Mediterranean, some {{individuals}} have adverse <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have {{the highest levels of}} the protein that causes this reaction.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} investor sentiment on the market <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> dividend change announcements. Design/methodology/approach: We use the European Economic Sentiment Indicator data, from Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN), {{as a proxy for}} investor sentiment and focus on the market <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> dividend change announcements, using panel data methodology. Findings: Using data from three European markets, our results indicate that the investor sentiment has some influence on the market <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> dividend change announcements, for two of the three analysed markets. Globally, we find no evidence of investor sentiment influencing the market <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> dividend change announcements for the Portuguese market. However, we find evidence that the positive share price <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> dividend increases enlarges with sentiment, {{in the case of the}} UK markets, whereas the negative share price <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> dividend decreases reduces with sentiment, in the French market. Research limitations/implications: We have no access to dividend forecasts, so, our findings are based on naïve dividend changes and not unexpected change dividends. Originality/value: This paper offers some insights on the effect of investor sentiment on the market <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> firms’ news, a strand of finance that is scarcely developed and contributes to the analysis of European markets that are in need of research. As the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the effect of investor sentiment on the market <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> dividend news, in the context of European markets...|$|R

5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films.

The designers focused on giving him realistic <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E
