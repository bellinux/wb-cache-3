40|$|The {{belief that}} alcohol alleviates social anxiety and {{acts as a}} social {{lubricant}} has long been recognized anecdotally, but only recently has this topic {{been the focus of}} systematic research. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship between alcohol expectancies and social anxiety. To explore this, forty social phobics and two hundred and forty-seven college undergraduates were given the Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire, social anxiety measures, and alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence questionnaires. ^ AEQ alcohol expectancy scale scores were calculated for each group. Next, the social anxiety measures were correlated with the domain of Increased Social Assertiveness (scale 4) of the AEQ. In separate analyses, AEQ scale scores were compared across group, level of alcohol consumption, gender, and social phobia subtype. ^ The relative order of the AEQ scales was found to be the same for both groups (i. e., Global Positive Changes (scale 1), Increased Social Assertiveness (scale 4), Physical and Social Pleasure (scale 3), Relaxation and Tension <b>Reduction</b> (<b>scale</b> 5), Arousal and Power (scale 6), and Enhanced Sexual Performance (scale 2)). Social anxiety was not found to be correlated with Increased Social Assertiveness (scale 4) for either anxious group, but was moderately correlated with this expectancy domain for the entire college sample. Analyses revealed that for the social phobics, the domain of Increased Social Assertiveness (scale 4) was best predicted by Global Positive Changes (scale 1), the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale (SADS), or quantity of alcohol consumption, whereas for the socially anxious college group, Increased Social Assertiveness (scale 4) was predicted by Relaxation and Tension <b>Reduction</b> (<b>scale</b> 5), Arousal and Power (scale 6), or degree of alcohol dependence. The social phobics 2 ̆ 7 alcohol expectancies were found to be significantly lower than those of the college sample. Several AEQ scales were found to be positively correlated with alcohol consumption. Finally, as predicted, there were no gender or social phobia subtype differences in strength of AEQ alcohol expectancies. ^ The limitations of the study are described and the results are discussed in terms of future research. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{dimensional}} reduction, {{in a form}} {{of transition}} from four to two dimensions, {{was used in the}} 90 s in a context of HE Regge scattering. Recently, it got a new impetus in quantum gravity where it opens the way to renormalizability and finite short-distance behavior.

Beyond this scale, in the deep UV 2 -dim region, the running coupling does not increase any more. Instead, it slightly decreases and tends to a finite value _ 2 (∞) < _ 2 (M^ 2) from above.

40|$|Sulfate reduction, a {{key process}} in aquatic sediments {{is carried out}} {{by a group of}} {{anaerobic}} microorganism called sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). High numbers of sulphate reducers in shrimp aquaculture pond sediment deteriorates the soil and water quality, causing physiological stress, thereby reducing the immunity of cultured animal. An attempt was made to evaluate the temporal and spatial distribution of SRB horizontally at different locations viz., water pumping area (WPA), sluice gate (SG) and pond center (PC), and vertically from sediment water interface to 10 cm depth in Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei culture ponds. Physico-chemical characteristics of water and soil were correlated with the number of SRB. Distribution of SRB was significantly higher (p ≤ 0. 05) in the pond sediment nearer to SG (874 MPN/g), followed by PC (272 MPN/g) and WPA (99 MPN/g) and at sediment water interface (751 MPN/g) compared to 10 cm depth (114 MPN/g) of pond profile.

40|$|The {{reducing}} power of plain broth cultures of Pneumococcus is largely {{dependent upon the}} presence in the medium {{at the time when}} the reduction test is performed of certain metabolites. The washed cells of Pneumococcus are able to reduce the various indicators of oxidation-reduction potentials in the presence of glucose. The relative velocity of reduction of these indicators is determined by the number of cells used in the test, the concentration of the dyes, and their position in the oxidation <b>reduction</b> <b>scale.</b> Oxidized thiol compounds (glutathione, cystine, oxidized thioglycollic acid) are likewise rapidly reduced by glucose in the presence of washed cells of Pneumococcus. This Pneumococcus-glucose system is able to form peroxide under aerobic conditions. Those substances which form peroxide in the presence of Pneumococcus cells are also the ones which Cole found to be active in changing hemoglobin into methemoglobin under the same conditions. The power of washed cells of Pneumococcus to reduce methylene blue in the presence of glucose is dependent on at least 2 constituents: one which can be readily removed from the cell by washing. Sugar-free meat infusion will function instead of it. The other is inactivated more slowly by the process of washing and is destroyed by 10 minutes heating at 55 °C. The interreaction between the glucose and the cell seems to result in a fundamental reaction in which one molecule of glucose becomes able to reduce rapidly one molecule of methylene blue. The existence of side-reactions often obscures this ratio. The significance of these observations is considered in relation to the nature and mechanism of the "activation" of metabolites, the preparation of synthetic media, the phenomena of growth, and the meaning of the expression "{{reducing power}} of a bacterial culture. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the realization of subjects in Russian (Ru) as compared with Polish (Po) and Czech (Cz). Non-overt realization seems to be a general option in the Slavic languages. However, whereas Cz and Po are uncontroversially pro-drop languages, the status of Ru needs a closer look. On the one hand, Ru allows both subjects and non-subjects to be absent at the surface without a difference concerning contexts and conditions. On the other hand, gaps and overt expressions turn out to be just different options that are freely available for the realization of non-emphatic subjects in Ru. We conclude that Ru is not a pro-drop language. Gaps can be accounted for as ellipsis. In {{the last part of the}} paper we bring scales into the picture. One can try and invoke Silverstein’s (1976) person/animacy hierarchy and a <b>reduction</b> <b>scale</b> to account for non-overt vs. overt realization of subjects. However, different systems of weak pronouns turn out to be the true factor determining subject realization in Ru, Po, and Cz. 1.

There are structural null subjects with non-finite verb forms (like, e. g., infinitives and adverbial participles (gerunds)) as shown in examples (1 a, b). This type of subject gap can be analyzed as PRO or an unpronounced copy. These gaps will not play a role in the present paper. ∗ This is a slightly revised version of the paper that we presented at the Workshop on Scales, Leipzig, March 29 - 30, 2008.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{instrument}} for assessing levels of patient medication risk reduction behaviors and apply that instrument to determine the extent to which patients currently engage in those behaviors. Instrument developed also was used to assess effects of a patient safety education program, designed to educate patients about these behaviors and encourage their participation in managing their medications. An instrument for measuring levels of patient medication risk reduction behaviors was developed based on behaviors identified by national experts as reducing risks. The survey instrument was mailed to 4, 000 individuals, 2, 000 each in intervention group and primary control group selected randomly from members of a prescription benefit plan. An intervention consisting of a brochure and a wallet card was mailed to respondents in the intervention group who had responded to the pre-intervention survey. A post-intervention survey was mailed to individuals in the intervention group and the primary control group who responded to the pre-intervention survey and individuals in a secondary control group that had not been previously surveyed. The patient medication risk <b>reduction</b> <b>scale</b> was analyzed using exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation. Internal consistency of the scale and its subscales was determined using Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha and item-total correlations. Changes in overall mean scale scores from pre-intervention to post-intervention were compared between the intervention group and the primary control group to determine the effect of intervention. Relationships between demographic variables and overall scale scores were assessed with one-way analysis of variance. Factor analysis reduced the preliminary 22 medication behavior items to a final scale of 18 items with four subscales: “asking,” “telling,” “writing” and “ensuring understanding”. The reliability of the scale measured by Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha was 0. 89. Patients performed behaviors related to writing medication-related information less frequently than behaviors related to understanding medication-related information. The frequency of medication risk reduction behaviors increased with increase in age of respondents. The relationship remained after controlling for all other demographic variables. Exposure of respondents to survey significantly increased medication risk reduction behaviors. However, the informational brochure did not have any significant additional impact on medication risk reduction behaviors. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{multiplexing}} gain of two-receiver Multiple-Input-Single-Output Broadcast Channel with imperfect channel state {{information at the}} transmitter (CSIT), a class of Rate-Splitting (RS) approaches has been proposed recently, which divides one receiver's message into a common and a private part, and superposes the common message on top of Zero-Forcing precoded private messages. In this paper, with quantized CSIT, we study the ergodic sum rate of two schemes, namely RS-S and RS-ST, where the common message(s) are transmitted via a space and space-time design, respectively. Firstly, we upper-bound the sum rate loss incurred by each scheme relative to Zero-Forcing Beamforming (ZFBF) with perfect CSIT. Secondly, we show that, to maintain a constant sum rate loss, RS-S scheme enables a feedback overhead reduction over ZFBF with quantized CSIT. Such <b>reduction</b> <b>scales</b> logarithmically with the constant rate loss at high Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR). We also find that, compared to RS-S scheme, RS-ST scheme offers a further feedback overhead <b>reduction</b> that <b>scales</b> with {{the discrepancy between the}} feedback overhead employed by the two receivers when there are alternating receiver-specific feedback qualities.
