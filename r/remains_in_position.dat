50|$|A seed {{separator}} is {{a structure}} {{found in the}} follicles of some Proteaceae. These follicles typically contain two seeds, with a seed separator between them. The seed separator {{is nothing but a}} little chip of wood, but in some cases it serves an important function: in serotinous species, the follicles open only in response to fire, but the seed separator <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>position,</b> thus preventing the seeds from falling out immediately, onto burnt or burning ground. Some separators loosen and fall out once they have cooled, thus ensuring that the seeds are released only after the fire has passed; others loosen and fall only after they have been moistened, thus ensuring that the seeds are released at the first rain after fire. Still others function as levers, recurving when moist and straightening when dry, and thus gradually levering the seeds out of the follicle {{in the course of a}} wet-dry cycle. This last case also occurs in non-serotinous species: follicles may open spontaneously, but seed release is delayed until the next rain.|$|E

40|$|Background “Tufting ” is {{essentially}} one-sided stitching (Fig. 1) which avoids {{the addition of}} crimp onto the fibre architecture induced by standard stitching. The tufting stitch is never ‘locked ’ and only <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> because of frictional forces acting on it, leading to an almost tension-free structure. As such, tufting represents a very novel approach to localized through-the-thickness reinforcement in composite structures for the dry preform/liquid resin injection manufacturing route. A single needle takes a yarn through the fabric layers and returns back along the same trajectory, leaving a loop of the yarn {{on the back side}} of the plies (Fig. 2). The concept of tufting for dry fabrics is analogous to Z-pinning for prepregs: they both intend to reduce th...|$|E
40|$|A word ladder is a {{sequence}} of words of the same length in which each word is successively transformed into the next word by changing only one of its letters and not rearranging the other letters. For example, QUITE becomes SUITE by changing Q to S. The sequence could continue with SUITE to SPITE. SPITE to SPINE, SPINE to SPINS, SPINS to SPANS, and so on, theoretically continuing for hundreds of words. In the six words of this ladder from QUITE to SPANS, though, no letter-position is changed more than once (e. g., after Q has been changed to S in position 1, S <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> 1 in each successive word). All the word ladders shown below follow this pattern of minimal changes, and they are thus known was minimal word ladders...|$|E
40|$|Assembled MEMS {{structures}} {{provide a}} unique design opportunity by overcoming the inherent planarity of MEMS devices, allowing for added flexibility and new application areas. However, external assembly {{of these devices}} is frequently problematic. Force and displacement controls are often imprecise at the microscale resulting in damage to the device. In contrast, self-assembling MEMS structures can avoid external manipulation and therefore can {{be less likely to}} suffer damage. Self-assembly, though, requires the added complexity of integrated actuation. One type of integrated actuation is driven by scratch drives. Scratch drive actuation is an electrostatic phenomenon that results when a suspended plate with an attached bushing is attracted to a flat plate. The attraction causes snap-down and zippering, pushing the bushing forward. When the charge is released, the plates separate, but the bushing <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>position,</b> causing a horizontal displacement. This process can be repeated to generate forward motion. This paper demonstrates a new CAD capability, the modeling of scratch drive actuation. Modeling any type of self-assembly necessarily involves extensive contact analysis capabilities. In the case of scratch drives, a full actuation cycle [...] consisting of pull-in, zippering, and release [...] must be modeled. This capability will be demonstrated by considering a polysilicon scratch drive actuator that was developed by researchers at the University of Tokyo. Their findings show that the distances the scratch drives travel in each step are approximately 0. 1 m and depend on the peak voltage, suspended plate length, and bushing height. Now, with CAD advances, such as fully coupled electro-mechanical contact analysis and post contact analysis, these devices can be simulated accur [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Past {{work on the}} {{morphology}} {{and biology}} of C. hesperidum is reviewed. Examination of the feeding sites, by means of sections and whole mounts, showed that penetration by the stylets is due to mechanical pressure, the stylets taking an intracellular path to the phloem with no visible effects on the cell contents. A stylet sheath surrounds the stylets and <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> following their retraction. The origin of this sheath is discussed and attributed to the saliva. A tactile stimulus is suggested as the initial stimulus directing the stylets to the phloem. A study of stylet retraction indicated that retraction is aided by the labium {{and the presence of}} part of the stylets within the crumena. The time taken for retraction varied from 6 to 70 minutes, whilst the speed increased during retraction. Separation of the stylets revealed an intrinsic tension in the mandibles which causes them to coil up. This tension is indicated as being overcome by the surface tension of the saliva existing between the maxillae and mandibles. This is suggested as a basic function of the saliva, responsible for the presence of the stylet sheath. Growth continues throughout each respective instar although increase in the length of the stylets during the life-cycle is small. A method of studying the feeding behaviour on the leaves, throughout the insect's life-cycle, is described. Most individuals remain in the same position throughout the lifecycle, a single penetration by the stylets lasting for the duration of each respective instar. At ecdysis, the shedding of the old stylets appears to aid the initial extension of the new stylets. Observations were made throughout the life-cycle which lasted for 69 days at 27 °C. Activity was restricted mainly to the first few hours although the ability to move is retained until parturition. <p...|$|E
40|$|Objective Today, a {{predominant}} {{percentage of}} vehicles involved in car crashes {{are exposed to}} oblique or frontal offset collisions. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the 50 th percentile male Hybrid III, THOR 99 and THOR Alpha dummies by comparing them with the corresponding kinematics of post mortem human subjects (PMHS) in this type of collision. Methods The PMHS data include results from oblique frontal collision tests. They include sled tests with near-side and far-side belt geometries at 15 °, 30 ° and 45 ° angles. The test subjects were restrained with a three-point lap-shoulder belt and the ?V was 30 km/h. Results The results from the Hybrid III and THOR 99 tests showed that, in most of the test, the head trajectories were an average of approximately 0. 1 m shorter than those from equivalent PMHS. The Hybrid III and THOR 99 far-side belt geometry tests showed that the belt remained in place longer on the shoulder of the Hybrid III than on the THOR 99 and the THOR Alpha. This was probably due to a stiffer lumbar spine in the Hybrid III and to a large groove in the steel of the superior surface of the Hybrid III shoulder structure. The THOR 99 escaped from the shoulder belt about 40 - 50 ms earlier than the THOR Alpha. The results from the THOR Alpha tests show that the head trajectory accorded fairly well with the PMHS data, as long as the shoulder belt did not slip off the shoulder. Although the THOR Alpha shoulder escaped the shoulder belt in the 45 ° far-side belt geometry, the PMHS did not. This may be due to the THOR Alpha shoulder design, with approximately 0. 05 m smaller superior and medial shoulder range-of-motion, in combination with a relatively soft lumbar spine. Conclusions The THOR Alpha provides head trajectories similar to those of the PMHS under these loading conditions, provided the shoulder belt <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> on the shoulder. When the shoulder belt slipped off the dummy shoulder, the head kinematics was altered. The shoulder range-of-motion may be a contributing factor to the overall kinematics of an occupant in oblique frontal impact situations where the occupant moves in a trajectory at an angle from that of the longitudinal direction of the car...|$|E
