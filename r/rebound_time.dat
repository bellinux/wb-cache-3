5000|$|At {{the opening}} of the show, Austin Bennett prepares for a date with his girlfriend Catherine, but discovers her {{cheating}} on him ("Another Saturday Night in New York"). He tells his brother Jeff, who suggests {{that the best way to}} win Catherine back is by pretending not to care. Jeff volunteers to find dates for them and plans a night on the town ("Oh What a Difference"). Meanwhile, Marcy Fitzwilliams is agonizing over her breakup with a man named Larry. Her friend Diana Bingley, an actuary, suggests some [...] "dating rules" [...] that will determine her ideal <b>rebound</b> <b>time,</b> telling Marcy that the best way to find Mr. Right is by finding Mr. Wrong ("The Actuary Song"). Austin and Jeff end up on a double-date with Marcy and Diana after setting one up on J-Date, despite none of them being Jewish. Diana is impressed with Jeff, but Marcy and Austin don't share a connection at all. Marcy reveals that she is a photographer, while Austin tells her that he writes greeting cards, but only as a way of supporting his passion for poetry. Austin is unable to explain this without frequently mentioning Catherine, to Marcy's annoyance ("But I Don't Want to Talk About Her"). Marcy decides Austin is [...] "perfectly wrong" [...] for her. Meanwhile, Jeff and Diana attempt to have sex, but Jeff throws his back out. Jeff's hospitalization gives Marcy a chance to try and continue seeing Austin. Over a conversation at the coffee shop, Marcy equates Austin's coffee preferences with his rigid lifestyle choices in general, and explains her own free-spirited nature ("Coffee"). Austin tries to call Catherine and win her back with an impromptu poem, which fails, and Marcy agrees to help him write a better one. As Jeff returns from the hospital and continues casually dating Diana, Marcy and Austin continue to work on a poem for Catherine, while fighting over details along the way. A bartender and cocktail waitress muse that their differences make them a perfect couple ("The Perfect Romance"). After Austin completes the poem, Marcy tells him to wait six months before sending it, but Jeff accidentally mails it out with the bills. Catherine's negative response ends up in Marcy's hands before Austin has seen it, and she takes him to a Chinese restaurant that offers free wine, in order to get him drunk enough to break the news to him. A series of humorous conflicts with the waiter at the restaurant result in Austin and Marcy skipping out on their bill and stealing a box of wine from the restaurant. Austin is impressed with himself for standing up for Marcy, and thanks her for his acting out of character ("Because of You"). When they are about to kiss, Marcy stops him and shows him the letter from Catherine. He grows angry, and they have a heated argument, but end up having sex. Meanwhile, Jeff and Diana articulate the nature of their [...] "friends with benefits" [...] relationship ("We're Just Friends"). The next day, Austin is ecstatic over his night with Marcy, and has fallen in love with her, though Marcy doesn't know how she feels about what happened. Jeff tells Austin to tell himself that he doesn't love her. Austin tries, but ends up thinking their relationship might have a future ("Maybe We Just Made Love"). Austin admits his feelings to Marcy, who rejects him, telling him she isn't ready for true love ("Just Not Now"). Ashamed, Austin goes home, and finds Catherine waiting for him.|$|E

40|$|Worldwide {{expenditures}} on international {{development in the}} form of assistance or “aid” have continued to increase as developed countries look to both help and influence developing countries. In 2011, more than $ 140 billion in development aid was distributed globally, more than double the amount expended for international development aid in 2003. Many of the countries that are in need of aid have governments that do not have the resources, the experience, political stability, or well-functioning institutions to effect long-term structural change to bring their people out of poverty. Ethiopia is a country receiving large amounts of development aid, and one of the poorest regions in Ethiopia is the Borana Plateau in the Oromia state. The people are semi-nomadic pastoralists who live off the livestock they raise. Climate change, as well as overgrazing and population growth, has reduced the amount of land available for pasture. Additionally, drought conditions can cause huge livestock losses due to death and the pressure to sell animals during droughts to generate money to buy food. The pastoral system is in constant danger of overstocking and suffering a system crash when drought events occur. Linear programing was used in this study to test various “scenarios” that shed light on how drastically drought and overpopulation impacts livestock numbers and overall livelihoods of the Boran pastoralists. How well livestock survive through droughts determines, in large measure, the need for food aid in the Borana Plateau and, with climate change increasing the frequency of drought events, the system struggles to rebound following droughts. These scenarios examined in this study tested the economic incentive the Boran have to clear land, and what impact clearing land has on livestock numbers, especially during drought years. The analysis also tested how keeping livestock in the system, as a result of drought mitigation strategies such as brush clearing, reduces the need for food aid during droughts and also reduces the <b>rebound</b> <b>time</b> for livestock numbers following a drought. The results determined that brush clearing provided the forage needed to keep cattle alive through a drought at various stocking levels up to and including estimated full capacity. This suggested that brush-clearing activities created an environment where people could return to pre-drought production levels without any <b>rebound</b> <b>time</b> following a drought if enough brush clearing and/or kalo development is undertaken. Kalo(s) serve as forage reserves, created from land cleared of brush and produce much more grass than from brush clearing alone and do it at a lower household cost...|$|E

40|$|Background: The equilibrated Kt/V (eKt/V), a {{clinical}} index of hemodialysis adequacy, {{can be calculated}} by several means. The commonly used methods are second generation of natural logarithm by Daugirdas and rate adjustment methods. However, these two methods used immediate post-dialysis blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (C 0). The authors investigated the accuracy of 30 -minute post-dialysis BUN (C 30), equilibrated BUN {{at the end of}} urea <b>rebound</b> <b>time,</b> to determine the eKt/V. Material and Method: We measured 7 values of eKt/V in 30 hemodialysis sessions by using the 5 following methods: 1). Empirical method (Emp) 2). Smye method (Sm) 3). Daugirdas method using C 0 and C 30 (Dau 0, Dau 30) 4). Rate adjustment method using C 0 and C 30 (Rate 0, Rate 30) 5). Double Pool urea kinetic model (DP),and compared with the gold standard values calculated by the modified Direct Dialysate Quantitative method (mDDQ). Results: All patients had adequate hemodialysis with eKt/V (mDDQ) = 1. 80 + 0. 22. Compared with mDDQ, the median of absolute difference of eKt/V were Rate 30 (0. 10); Dau 30 (0. 11), Rate 0 (0. 11), Sm (0. 11); Emp (0. 13); DP (0. 15); Dau 0 (0. 35) while the correlation coefficient (r 2) were 0. 926, 0. 948, 0. 785, 0. 629, 0. 551, 0. 833,and 0. 806 respectively. Conclusion: By using 30 -minute post-dialysis BUN to calculate, the values of eKt/V by Daugirdas and rate adjustment methods were associated with better accuracy and correlation than immediate post-dialysis BUN. In the demand of the accurate eKt/V measurement, the Dau 30 and Rate 30 may be the suitable method to determine the eKt/V in clinical hemodialysis...|$|E

40|$|A passive {{cavitation}} detector (PCD) identifies cavitation events by sensing acoustic emissions {{generated by}} the collapse of bubbles. In this work, a dual passive cavitation detector (dual PCD), consisting of a pair of orthogonal confocal receivers, is described for use in shock wave lithotripsy. Cavitation events are detected by both receivers and can be localized to within 5 mm {{by the nature of the}} small intersecting volume of the focal areas of the two receivers in association with a coincidence detection algorithm. A calibration technique, based on the impulse response of the transducer, was employed to estimate radiated pressures at collapse near the bubble. Results are presented for the in vitro cavitation fields of both a clinical and a research electrohydraulic lithotripter. The measured lifetime of the primary growth-and-collapse of the cavitation bubbles increased from 180 to 420 microseconds as the power setting was increased from 12 to 24 kV. The measured lifetime compared well with calculations based on the Gilmore-Akulichev formulation for bubble dynamics. The radiated acoustic pressure 10 mm from the collapsing cavitation bubble was measured to vary from 4 to 16 MPa with increasing power setting; although the trends agreed with calculations, the predicted values were four times larger than measured values. The axial length of the cavitation field correlated well with the 6 -dB region of the acoustic field. However, the width of the cavitation field (10 mm) was significantly narrower than the acoustic field (25 mm) as bubbles appeared to be drawn to the acoustic axis during the collapse. The dual PCD also detected signals from "rebounds," secondary and tertiary growth-and-collapse cycles. The measured <b>rebound</b> <b>time</b> did not agree with calculations from the single-bubble model. The rebounds could be fitted to a Rayleigh collapse model by considering the entire bubble cloud as an effective single bubble. The results from the dual PCD agreed well with images from high-speed photography. The results indicate that single-bubble theory is sufficient to model lithotripsy cavitation dynamics up to time of the main collapse, but that upon collapse bubble cloud dynamics becomes important...|$|E
40|$|Global food {{security}} is impacted by aggregate agricultural production variability {{at the global}} level. The United States produces and exports {{a substantial amount of}} crop commodities. So, a production shortfall in the U. S. results in some price spike as well as quantity shortfall at the global level. This study examined production variability of corn in the U. S. since 1970 and found that relative production variability after factoring in the trend effect had declined over time. In the U. S. and world, weather has been a primary factor causing occasional production shortfall of major crops. To better understand the impact of weather on corn yield a new index, Net Crop Moisture Deficit (NCMD), was created. NCMD captures the marginal contribution of an inch of water on yield at different spatial and temporal scales taking into consideration plant biological requirements. NCMD was compared with more widely used seasonal aggregate precipitation data for fourteen sample Nebraska counties and was found to do a superior job of identifying both drought and non- drought years. Moreover, it was also found that NCMD values through July predicted expected deviation from yield quite well. This study also empirically analyzed and found that the recently popular Drought Mitigation Center (DMC) data was linked satisfactorily to corn yield. When the DMC measure was compared with NCMD it was found that NCMD was marginally superior to DMC data in identifying drought and no-drought years as well as making predictions for expected deviation of yield for corn. After identifying the years when production shortfall was a result of yield and/or acreage decrease in the U. S for three major crops (corn, soybeans, and wheat), examination of changes in utilization categories and effect on world price indices was done. The analysis revealed that stocks and exports accounted {{for the majority of the}} adjustments during production shortfall years. However, the <b>rebound</b> <b>time</b> or time required to reach the expected production level as well as utilization level for all major categories, after production shortfall was only one or two years, suggesting the normal market forces rather quickly restore production and prices of major crop commodities. The world price indices saw some increase due to the U. S. production shortfall but for the most part also fell back to the shortfall previous year level within one to three years. This implied that global {{food security}} problem in the short run is generally manageable given appropriate levels of stocks maintained at national and global levels. ...|$|E
40|$|The Leidenfrost effect {{influences}} substantially {{the contact}} of a liquid droplet {{with a hot}} surface. Contact between the liquid and solid is crucial for cooling applications such as fire-fighting, hot-mill steel rolling, thermal power plants and microprocessor cooling. In automotive or aerospace internal combustion engines, the combustion chamber is pressurized prior to ignition. Despite various effects of elevated pressure, the combustion process needs to be controlled. The reaction time in a combustion chamber is limited, but mixture preparation involves prior evaporation. Fuel in contact with a combustion chamber wall evaporates in a uncontrolled manner. Furthermore, the fuel reacts with lubricants and decomposes into coke residue. The fundamental physics of the Leidenfrost effect are yet to be fully understood. This applies especially {{to the influence of}} pressure on the Leidenfrost effect. For the question, if injected water droplets would stay in contact with the heated combustion chamber wall, current models would need to be extrapolated from ambient pressure, although there is no validation experiment available. This experimental study addresses the influence of elevated pressure on the Leidenfrost effect, providing observations and measurements suitable to validate theories, hence extending the knowledge about the Leidenfrost effect. The experiment is implemented inside a pressure chamber and results for single water droplets impinging onto a hot aluminium substrate are presented. The droplet impingement Weber number was 5. The experiments were conducted at chamber pressures from 1 to 25 bar (0. 1 to 2. 5 MPa) and wall temperatures from 100 to 460 °C (373 to 733 K). Based on video observations, phenomenological boiling states are identified and mapped on a pressure-temperature diagram. The various states of impact behaviour shift to higher temperatures with increasing pressure. Nucleate boiling and critical temperature models of the bulk liquid serve as the lower and the upper bounds for the transition for all observed states of droplets, respectively. A new nucleation model, accounting for the fluid flow inside the impacting droplet, agrees reasonably well with experimental results for the nucleate boiling in the experiment. All previous theories and correlations predict transition temperatures which are constant or deviate from experimental values at elevated pressures. Therefore, the theoretical part of this study tests refined hypotheses for transition from nucleate boiling to film boiling. A Landau instability model and a bubble percolation model propose explanations for transitions in the boiling phenomena, but these models deviate from experimental results. Refinement of these approaches is still needed with respect to the characteristic length of instability and the active nucleation site count. The experimentally observed onset of the transition state exhibits a linearity between the reduced pressure value and the reduced contact overheat. The boiling states are further quantified with the measurement of the residence time upon the target. In the wetting state at ambient pressure, the residence time is equal to the evaporation time of the droplets. Residence time is lower for the transition and the Leidenfrost rebound states. The droplet detaches from the surface prior to complete evaporation. Residence time thresholds mark the observed transition state. Asymptotic <b>rebound</b> <b>time</b> marks the rebound state. The time thresholds follow the state borders in the pressure-temperature map. Secondary droplets are detected with the shadowgraph technique. Characterization of the secondary droplets has been achieved using a new image processing algorithm. It is based on the irradiance model of a semi infinite screen. The Sauter mean diameter of the secondary droplets in transition boiling state increases with increasing pressure. An increasing trend of the Sauter mean diameter of secondary droplets to the bubble departure diameter was observed...|$|E

40|$|Massive {{research}} efforts are now underway {{to develop a}} cure for HIV infection, allowing patients to discontinue lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). New latency-reversing agents (LRAs) {{may be able to}} purge the persistent reservoir of latent virus in resting memory CD 4 + T cells, but the degree of reservoir reduction needed for cure remains unknown. Here we use a stochastic model of infection dynamics to estimate the efficacy of LRA needed to prevent viral rebound after ART interruption. We incorporate clinical data to estimate population-level parameter distributions and outcomes. Our findings suggest that approximately 2, 000 -fold reductions are required to permit a majority of patients to interrupt ART for one year without rebound and that rebound may occur suddenly after multiple years. Greater than 10, 000 -fold reductions may be required to prevent rebound altogether. Our results predict large variation in <b>rebound</b> <b>times</b> following LRA therapy, which will complicate clinical management. This model provides benchmarks for moving LRAs from the lab to the clinic and can aid in the design and interpretation of clinical trials. These results also apply to other interventions to reduce the latent reservoir and can explain the observed return of viremia after months of apparent cure in recent bone marrow transplant recipients and an immediately-treated neonate.
