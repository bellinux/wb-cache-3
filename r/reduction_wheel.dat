Many interruptions to the harvesting operation have been caused by infield transport not being able to traverse the soft vertisol soils that prevail in this area. The Brixius model was used to predict the tractive performance of a New Holland 110 - 90 tractor with a cone index (CI) of less than 700 kPa. The main ratios and forces that characterize traction dynamics (motion resistance, net traction, motion resistance ratio, gross traction ratio, net traction ratio and tractive efficiency) were obtained as a function of soil strength and dynamic wheel load.

40|$|The Laser Infrared Reflectometry (LIR) {{laboratory}} at NIST includes a facility for {{the measurement of}} very low reflectance levels of materials and cavities in the infrared such as those used in high accuracy radiometers and blackbody reference sources. The key elements of the facility are integrating sphere systems, which are used to collect the reflected light from the samples and cavities that are measured. For cavity instruments, the effective emissivity or absorptance can be obtained simply by subtraction of the reflectance from unity. The first sphere system, in operation for the last 5 years, the Complete Hemispherical Infrared Laser-based Reflectometer (CHILR), {{has been used to}} examine a large number of blackbody and radiometer cavities. However, it is limited to the measurement of cavities with aperture diameters not exceeding 50 mm. There has been an unmet need for the characterization of larger aperture cavities. This presentation reports on the status of a new sphere system designed for accurate measurements of cavities with apertures up to 200 mm in diameter. The core of a new setup is a 50 cm integrating sphere with an integrated substitution / port <b>reduction</b> <b>wheel</b> and means for mapping the spatial distribution of reflectance of the object under test. We describe the concept and performance goals of the new capability. We present the first results of its evaluation, including coating properties and throughput evaluation results, which allow estimates of the signal to noise ratio for different laser sources, as well as the minimum discernable reflectance levels of targets. While full implementation of the new capability may require more time and resources, it is available to support the critical needs of the community.

40|$|A compact sized PDE with an i. d. of 0. 75 in. {{and length}} of 1 m was paired with an {{automotive}} turbocharger. The turbine-compressor shaft was used to drive a small ac generator by means of speed <b>reduction</b> <b>wheels.</b> The PDE was tested with propane-oxygen mixture at 15 Hz {{for a period of}} about 20 s. The turbine spun up to a speed of 127, 000 rpm, whilst the generator produced electric power at 27 W and the compressor pumped air at a rate of 0. 055 kg/s. The exhaust of the turbine was measured to be 800 ˚C, which implies that the exhaust has enough enthalpy to drive a few more turbine stages. The radial turbine results in more losses as it diverts the flow by 90 ˚ and its housing also creates hot spots. Axial turbines are better suited for application with PDEs and also enable better speed reduction gearing mechanisms to be applied, allowing larger and heavier generators to be used with turbines. The turbocharger did not exhibit any signs of damage after several minutes of testing.

40|$|When {{analyzing}} the aerodynamic {{characteristics of a}} road vehicle, the flow around the basic body shape {{is complicated by the}} presence of the rotating wheels. Even though on most vehicles the wheels are partially shrouded their effect on the flowfield is still considerable. Despite this, very little is understood about the flow around a rotating wheel. This thesis describes the development of a validated steady state Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes CFD model to investigate the flow around automobile wheels. As all the previous investigations into the aerodynamic characteristics of wheel flows had been experimental, preliminary computational studies were performed. The basis of these was the 2 D circular cylinder. The effects of cylinder rotation and ground proximity were modelled, and strategies for boundary conditions and mesh topology were developed. This work was extended into 3 D with the modelling of an isolated wheel, both rotating and stationary. Using existing experimental data for validation, an extensive investigation into the effects of solver numerics, symmetry planes, turbulence models, and the method of turbulent closure was performed. An optimum solver configuration was developed which comprised of the RNG k-E turbulence model with full boundary layer closure. It was accurately predicted that the rotating wheel generates less lift and drag than the equivalent stationary wheel. A number of postulated experimental flow features were captured in the final solutions. Using a parallel experimental study to provide further validation data, the CFD model was extended to incorporate an asymmetric shroud containing a wheelhouse cavity. The influence of the rotation of the wheel, the geometry of the shroud, and the thickness of the stationary groundplane boundary layer were investigated. The rotating wheel now produced more drag than the equivalent stationary <b>wheel.</b> <b>Reductions</b> in <b>wheel</b> drag were found with a reduction in the ride height of the shroud, and with the addition of spoilers to the lower front edge of the shroud.

40|$|High {{wheel-rail contact}} stress {{is related to}} rail damage {{mechanisms}} such as gross plastic flow. Such high contact stresses are often generated by freight vehicles which have comparatively high axleloads. On railways in Great Britain (GB) a limit {{is placed on the}} ratio of static wheel load (Q) to wheel diameter (D) as a proxy to control contact stress related damage. However, there is increasing interest in the use of smaller diameter wheels on freight vehicles, in order to prolong wheelset life (smaller scrap diameter) and increase capacity within the GB’s constrained structure gauge. GB Railway Group Standards [1] limit Q/D to 0. 13 kN/mm. However it is known that a number of freight wagons already operate above this limit, either due to derogations granted against the standard, or as a result of being introduced prior to the standard’s universal application (‘Grandfather Rights’).

40|$|Railhead {{is perhaps}} the highest {{stressed}} civil infrastructure due {{to the passage of}} heavily loaded wheels through a very small contact patch. The stresses at the contact patch cause yielding of the railhead material and wear. Many theories exist for the prediction of these mechanisms of continuous rails; this process in the discontinuous rails is relatively sparingly researched. Discontinuous railhead edges fail due to accumulating excessive plastic strains. Significant safety concern is widely reported as these edges form part of Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) in the signalling track circuitry. Since Hertzian contact is not valid at a discontinuous edge, 3 D finite element (3 DFE) models of wheel contact at a railhead edge have been used in this research. Elastic–plastic material properties of the head hardened rail steel have been experimentally determined through uniaxial monotonic tension tests and incorporated into a FE model of a cylindrical specimen subject to cyclic tension load- ing. The parameters required for the Chaboche kinematic hardening model have been determined from the stabilised hysteresis loops of the cyclic load simulation and imple- mented into the 3 DFE model. The 3 DFE predictions of the plastic strain accumulation {{in the vicinity of the}} wheel contact at discontinuous railhead edges are shown to be affected by the contact due to passage of wheels rather than the magnitude of the loads the wheels carry. Therefore to eliminate this failure mechanism, modification to the contact patch is essential; <b>reduction</b> in <b>wheel</b> load cannot solve this problem...|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} railway rolling noise {{requires}} a <b>reduction</b> in <b>wheel</b> and track noise emission. In this paper, a parametric {{study of the}} possible minimization of the track sound power is presented. In an initial global approach, a number of potential variations in track parameters are assessed {{in terms of their}} likely effect on rolling noise. From this, two main themes are selected for deeper study by use of TWINS model. The first parameter considered is the stiffness and damping of the rail-pad. By reducing the pad stiffness, the noise radiation from the sleeper is reduced but that from the rail is increased, and vice versa. An optimum is found when the rail and sleeper components are equal, for which the track radiation is a minimum. Starting from one existing track design, this optimum pad stiffness has been derived for an example wheel. The second area investigated is the increase of the attenuation rate of rail vibrations by the addition of damping measures. The implementation of dynamic absorbers with a mass of 5 kg every sleeper bay (0. 6 m) leads to predicted reductions of track radiation of 2 dB(A) if the rail-pad stiffness is already optimal. For softer pads a larger reduction has been found, but the total effect is less than the combined effect of first changing to the optimum pad stiffness and then adding absorbers. Globally, for ballasted track with bibloc concrete sleepers, a 2 - 6 dB(A) reduction in track sound power can be expected through a rail-pad optimization and/or the implementation of dynamic absorbers on the rail...|$|R

40|$|The noise-generating {{characteristics}} of {{two types of}} railway wheel design have been studied theoretically. These are "resilient wheels" in which a viscoelastic layer is located between the type and the web, and wheels with constrained layer damping treatments applied to the web. A method of predicting the rolling noise of these wheel types using the TWINS rolling noise model has been developed. For this, a modal description of the wheel must be constructed. A finite element model {{is used to calculate}} the mode shapes and modal masses. The modal damping is predicted by a complex modal analysis of the finite element model in which a material-specific damping parameter is used. Analyses have been carried out for a number of resilient wheels with different stiffnesses of their resilient layer, including the case where the wheel becomes a conventional one by specifying the resilient element as steel. The sound power radiated by both the wheel and the rail are shown to be dependent on this stiffness.

The target is a wheel design {{that meets the}} requirements for fatigue strength, while minimizing the unsprung mass and rolling noise. A 3 -level full factorial (3 LFF) DOE is used to collect data points required to set up Response Surface Models (RSM) relating design and response variables in the design space. Computationally efficient simulations are thereafter performed using the RSM to identify the solution that best fits the design target. A demonstration example, including four geometric design variables in a parametric finite element (FE) model, is presented. The design variables are wheel radius, web thickness, lateral offset between rim and hub, and radii at the transitions rim/web and hub/web, but more variables (including material properties) can be added if needed.

Hybrid trucks may be a worthwhile solution, especially for activities at very early or late hours. Apart from some noise reduction figures put forward by manufacturers or concerned users, the actual noise benefit of these vehicles is not well known. The present study assesses the noise emission of one hybrid distribution truck, either in hybrid or electric mode, over wide real usage conditions, and compares it to an equivalent full thermic truck. Constant speed pass-bys as well as accelerating or braking phases are tested. Measurement includes third-octave and global standard 7. 5 m noise levels, noise source analysis resulting from microphone array processing, and vertical directivity. The truck in hybrid mode comes out to be a little less noisy than the full thermic one at constant speeds, but deteriorates when accelerating, mainly due to drive tire characteristics. The electric mode benefit exceeds 8 dB(A) at low speed, reduces at higher speeds and vanishes beyond 50 km/h.

Intrinsic aerobic capacity may influence OVX-induced metabolic dysfunction. Female rats selectively bred for high (HCR) and low (LCR) aerobic capacity were used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which intrinsic aerobic fitness impacts OVX-associated metabolic dysfunction. We demonstrated that HCR were not fully protected against an OVX-induced decline in insulin sensitivity partially due to a ~ 30 % attenuation of insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake. HCROVX were protective against HFD-associated insulin resistance through a unique mechanism of behavioral change (i. e. compensatory increase in spontaneous physical activity), while LCROVX exacerbated insulin resistance following HFD.

Murine GHV- 68 (MuGHV) {{has been used as}} a model of EBV. However, the behavioral impact of infection with MuGHV is unknown. METHODS: Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice (25 – 28 g at time of surgery) were housed in cages containing running wheels and infrared detectors to measure activity. Mice were administered vehicle intranasally (I. N.) at dark onset and recordings of EEG, body temperature and activity were made for 4 days. Mice were inoculated I. N. at dark onset with 400 PFU (n= 13) or 40, 000 PFU (n= 8) of MuGHV and recordings continued for 30 days. Mice were then injected intraperitoneally (I. P.) at dark onset with vehicle and 24 h control recordings obtained. The mice were injected I. P. with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and recordings continued for 5 days. Mice housed in the same conditions were inoculated I. N. with vehicle and sacrificed after 4 days or inoculated with 400 PFU or with 40, 000 PFU MuGHV and sacrificed 5, 9, or 26 days after inoculation. Brain tissue, blood, spleen, and lung were collected, and stored at - 80 °C until assay. RESULTS: Infected mice showed decreases in wheel running activity, core body temperature, food intake and body weight. Mice inoculated with 40, 000 PFU of MuGHV had increases in NREM sleep, sleep fragmentation, and wakefulness during the peak of viral replication. Responses of infected mice to LPS were exacerbated. Cytokine concentrations and profiles in brain and the periphery were altered during infection. The alterations in cytokine profiles differed in a complex manner depending on dose of MuGHV. Based upon <b>reductions</b> in <b>wheel</b> running, these results indicate that mice become chronically fatigued during infection with MuGHV. Chronic infection is associated with long-term changes in thermoregulatory mechanisms and the ability of the immune system to respond normally to subsequent challenge. Virus-induced alterations in central cytokine profiles with respect to those in the periphery suggest potential mechanisms that may lead to fatigue. These studies demonstrate the utility of MuGHV as a model for post-viral fatigue infection...|$|R
