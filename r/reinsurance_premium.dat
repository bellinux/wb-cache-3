40|$|Let X {{denote the}} loss {{initially}} assumed by an insurer. In a reinsurance design, the insurer cedes {{part of its}} loss, say f(X), to a reinsurer, and thus the insurer retains a loss If (X) = X − f(X). In return, the insurer is obligated to compensate the reinsurer for undertaking the risk by paying the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>premium.</b> Hence, {{the sum of the}} retained loss and the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>premium</b> can be interpreted as the total cost of managing the risk in the presence of reinsurance. Based on a technique used in Müller and Stoyan (2002) and motivated by Cai and Tan (2007) on using the valueat-risk (VaR) and the conditional tail expectation (CTE) of an insurer’s total cost as the criteria for determining the optimal reinsurance, this paper derives the optimal ceded loss functions in a class of increasing convex ceded loss functions.

Insurance companies often purchase reinsurance to protect themselves against the risk of a loss above a certain threshold; the cost of <b>reinsurance</b> (<b>reinsurance</b> <b>premiums)</b> is deducted from gross premiums written to arrive at net premiums written. Net premiums written is the sum of all types of insurance premiums which a company may collect throughout the whole duration of existing insurance policies minus the costs like agent's commissions or payments made for reinsurance.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a risk {{model in which}} deficits after ruin are covered by {{a new type of}} reinsurance contract that provides capital injections which depend on a chosen level of retention. To allow the insurance company's survival after ruin, the reinsurer would have to inject capital. Assuming that these capital injections are not from the shareholders, but rather obtained through such new reinsurance agreements, the problem here is to determine adequate reinsurance premiums. It seems fair to base the net <b>reinsurance</b> <b>premium</b> on the discounted expected value of any future capital injections. Inspired by the results of Huzak et al. (2004) and Ben Salah (2014) on successive ruin events, we show that an explicit formula for this <b>reinsurance</b> <b>premium</b> exists in a setting where aggregate claims are modeled by a subordinator and a Brownian perturbation.

40|$|We {{identify}} a new benefit of index or parametric triggers. Asymmetric information between reinsurers on an insurer's risk affects {{competition in the}} reinsurance market: reinsurers are subject to adverse selection, since only high-risk insurers may find it optimal to change reinsurers. The result is high <b>reinsurance</b> <b>premiums</b> and cross-subsidization of high-risk insurers by low-risk insurers. A contract with a parametric or index trigger (such as a catastrophe bond) is insensitive to information asymmetry and therefore alters the equilibrium in the reinsurance market. Provided that basis risk is not too high, the introduction of contracts with parametric or index triggers provides low-risk insurers with an alternative to reinsurance contracts, and therefore leads to less cross-subsidization in the reinsurance market.

40|$|The {{quest for}} optimal {{reinsurance}} design has remained an interesting problem among insurers, reinsurers, and academicians. An {{appropriate use of}} reinsurance could reduce the underwriting risk of an insurer and thereby enhance its value. This paper complements the existing research on optimal reinsurance by proposing another model for {{the determination of the}} optimal reinsurance design. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the value-at-risk of the net risk of the insurer while subjecting to a profitability constraint. The proposed optimal reinsurance model, therefore, has the advantage of exploiting the classical tradeoff between risk and reward. Under the additional assumptions that the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>premium</b> is determined by the expectation premium principle and the ceded loss function is confined to a class of increasing and convex functions, explicit solutions are derived. Depending on the risk measure's level of confidence, the safety loading for the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>premium,</b> and the expected profit guaranteed for the insurer, we establish conditions for the existence of reinsurance. When it is optimal to cede the insurer's risk, the optimal reinsurance design could be in the form of pure stop-loss reinsurance, quota-share reinsurance, or a combination of stop-loss and quota-share reinsurance. ...|$|E

A relatively simple rule of thumb is formulated for choosing the best approximation for either model. This approximation satisfies the aforementioned criterion. Finally, by comparing the two models, it is demonstrated that a small degree of dependence between the claims already has a substantial effect on the stop-loss premiums. The difference can run up to a factor 500...|$|R
40|$|Like the {{preceding}} article, this article {{argues that the}} high costs of reinsurance present the opportunity for hedging instruments to be offered to primary insurers that are both competitive with current reinsurance and that offer investors high rates of return. But the combination of high <b>reinsurance</b> <b>premiums</b> and the vast capacity of the capital market for diversification is not sufficient to ensure the success of these new instruments. If new instruments such as catastrophe options and catastrophelinked bonds are to compete successfully with reinsurance, they must provide a cost-effective means of resolving incentive conflicts between the primary insurer and the ultimate risk bearer that are known as "moral hazard. " Without an effective solution of this moral hazard problem, the use of past insurance loss data to estimate the potential returns for purchasers of catastrophe bonds and other such instruments will be misleading and unreliable. 1997 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem raised in the Astin Bulletin (1999) by Prof. Benktander at the occasion of his 80 th birthday concerning the choice of an appropriate claim size distribution in connection with reinsurance rating problems.

Whereas the models in extreme-value methods are non-parametric or semi-parametric of nature, practitioners often need a fully parametric model for assessing a portfolio risk both in the tails and in more central portions of the claim distribution. To this end we propose a parametric model, termed the generalised Burr-gamma distribution, which possesses such flexibility.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{integrated}} {{risk management plan}} for catastrophe risks in the European Union, consisting of three layers.

An approach that utilizes a pan-European reinsurance program is proven to be the most efficient solution for minimizing the total cost of catastrophe risks in the European Union.

Member-state funds would be required to adopt adequate disaster response and management mechanisms and enforce reasonable building code, land use, and mitigation efforts to minimize the amount of insured losses. As the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>premiums</b> charged by EUROCAT would be risk-based, the pricing mechanism would be used to encourage active development and enforcement of these standards. ...|$|R
