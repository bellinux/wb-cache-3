They can also appear as free morphemes or as differing agreement paradigms. However, most switch-reference languages are subject-object-verb languages, with verbs as well as complementizers and conjunctions coming at the end of clauses.

40|$|Papuan speech {{communities}} in New Guinea share {{a number of}} specific discourse preferences {{that are used in}} similar ways in certain genres. This article focuses on three discourse practices as they operate in narrative texts; thematization (a strong preference for Theme, Predication or Left Dislocation constructions), distribution (a strong preference to distribute nominals over series of clauses and of modifiers over series of phrases) and <b>recapitulative</b> linkage (connecting clause chains or sentences by tail-head linkage). Thematization occurs especially in discourse initial paragraphs when the time, place, participant and main themes are introduced, and in discourse final paragraphs with summarizing and concluding functions. Thematization combines with non-distributive forms in these contexts to form discourse units in which the number and complexity of nominal phrases is relatively high. Such thematic parts are not organized around progression of events and <b>recapitulative</b> linkage is hardly present. Once the story is underway, distributive tendencies become more dominant, with unmarked, chained forms of <b>recapitulative</b> linkage connecting the often lengthy and 'verby' sentences into chaining paragraphs. When marked, thematized <b>recapitulative</b> linkage occurs, this signals thematic discontinuity. Many aspects of the typology of Papuan languages, from demonstrative topic markers to experiential, subordinate and perception complement constructions, can be understood from the perspective of these areal discourse preferences of Papuan speakers. But the identification of these areal pragmatic patterns not only enhances our understanding of the specific nature of Papuan languages, it also has crucial methodological implications for the way field linguists transcribe and analyse whole texts or single expressions from these languages. Ignoring these discourse practices may lead to serious distortions in the transcription and collection of data and in the grammatical description of these languages. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|There is {{fundamentally}} {{no difference between}} a value added tax (VAT), and a retail sales tax (RST) {{when it comes to}} collecting the tax on cross-border sales. If (under a VAT) a seller is allowed to “zero-rate” cross-border sales, or if (under a RST) a seller is exempt from collecting the tax on cross-border sales, the critical enforcement question is exactly the same – how does the system assure that the buyer will self-assess (and pay) the tax? The simple answer is that the tax administration audits. The more complicated answer notes that the effectiveness of the audit (by the destination jurisdiction) depends heavily on its ability to secure transactional data from the origin jurisdiction. Without a good information exchange mechanism this audit is difficult. The EU’s data-sharing mechanism involves <b>recapitulative</b> statements by origin state sellers and a VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) that shares this information with the destination state. There is a technology-intensive proposal to do the same among the US states, the Use Tax Reciprocity (UTR) system. The EU’s <b>recapitulative</b> statement/VIES network is a classic Black Swan, a program characterized by extraordinary cost overruns, extreme schedule delays, and dramatic shortfalls in realized benefits. Black Swans have an average cost overrun of 200 %, and an average schedule overrun of 70 %. The UTR has the same problems. Program management professionals from the Harvard, Berkeley and Oxford business schools would suggest that the UTR promoters suffer from “Black Swan blindness. ” They need to ask if this major IT project: (1) Can absorb the hit if the project goes over budget by 400 %? (2) Can survive if only 25 % to 50 % of the projected benefits are realized?

In Austen we find a closed, coherent and orderly world whose boundaries and exclusions make possible the polite society within. In Joyce's Ulysses, we instead find the overlaying and intermingling of differing spatial scales and forms. The result is a tension between an ordered, systematic spatiality and a chaotic form when its <b>recapitulative</b> structure exceeds its own boundaries. In both we find a fictive landscape which helps make the novels work by reframing and reimagining the world.

40|$|International audienceThe {{myriad of}} {{potential}} applications supported by {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) has generated much interest from the research community. Various applications range from small size low industrial monitoring to large scale energy constrained environmental monitoring. In all cases, an operational network is required to fulfill the application missions. In addition, energy consumption of nodes is a great challenge {{in order to maximize}} network lifetime. Unlike other networks, it can be hazardous, very expensive or even impossible to charge or replace exhausted batteries due to the hostile nature of environment. Researchers are invited to design energy efficient protocols while achieving the desired network operations. This paper focuses on different techniques to reduce the consumption of the limited energy budget of sensor nodes. After having identified the reasons of energy waste in WSNs, we classify energy efficient techniques into five classes, namely data reduction, control reduction, energy efficient routing, duty cycling and topology control. We then detail each of them, presenting subdivisions and giving many examples. We conclude by a <b>recapitulative</b> table...|$|E

40|$|This article explores {{discourse}} {{practices in}} Paluai (Admiralties, Oceanic, Austronesian), spoken on Baluan Island (Manus Province, Papua New Guinea), comparing {{similarities and differences}} with discourse practices in Papuan languages (see e. g. de Vries, 1995, de Vries, 2005 and de Vries, 2006). Many Papuan languages exhibit discourse practices which cross genetic boundaries: 'distributive', 'thematizing' and 'recapulative' strategies, which {{may lead to a}} high frequency of certain expression types and ultimately to grammaticalization. These practices have been described for several genetically unrelated Papuan languages, and they can be regarded as an areal feature of the region. Although these strategies are not unique to Papuan languages, their frequency distinguishes this region from others. Thematization is a strategy used in particular {{at the beginning of a}} narrative. Like in many Papuan languages, certain Paluai demonstratives are used as markers of topicality and/or definiteness. Distributive strategies with only one modifier per head are preferred, and thus verbs typically have one full nominal argument and nouns one modifier. <b>Recapitulative</b> strategies, predominantly tail–head linkage, are very common too. This raises the question whether the features encountered in Paluai are also frequent in other non-Papuan languages across New Guinea...|$|E
40|$|Today, in {{the domain}} of public policy evaluation, it is still {{difficult}} to link the theoretical with the practical (RIST, C. R. 1995). The first reason for this difficulty is that the theoretical ground and, in particular, the domain of methodology of evaluation is still strewn with many conflicting technical, political and philosophical ideas. Consequently, in this field, we have to master the theory of economic policy (to analyse chains of causality between instruments and objectives), the theory of the demand of collective services induced by public policies (see, for instance, [BASLÉ, M., (1995 a) ], and the theory of values or judgement of values. BASLÉ, M., (1995 b). The second reason is that we always have to choose between different disciplinary approaches and that we have also to choose between different evaluation procedures or process and between diverse evaluation tools (inquiry, different means of production of information [...] .). Every choice will always depends on many parameters: expertise by national satistical institutes, presence of scientifically different persons, abilities to meet in an institutionalised instance, abilities to control the quality of information. Even in the most propitious circumstances, the choice is hardly neutral: for instance everybody can easily be transformed in an "interest group " seeking to capture the process of production of information and the process of evaluation The third reason is the lack of agreement over the finality of evaluation: should the information be collected to be incorporated in a <b>recapitulative</b> evaluation, its results considered as important, taken up and officialized by th...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{have many}} fields of application, {{including}} industrial, environmental, military, health and home domains. Monitoring a given zone {{is one of}} the main goals of this technology. This consists in deploying sensor nodes in order to detect any event occurring in the zone of interest considered and report this event to the sink. The monitoring task can vary depending on the application domain concerned. In the industrial domain, the fast and easy deployment of wireless sensor nodes allows a better monitoring of the area of interest in temporary worksites. This deployment must be able to cope with obstacles and be energy efficient in order to maximize the network lifetime. If the deployment is made after a disaster, it will operate in an unfriendly environment that is discovered dynamically. We present a survey that focuses on two major issues in WSNs: coverage and connectivity. We motivate our study by giving different use cases corresponding to different coverage, connectivity, latency and robustness requirements of the applications considered. We present a general and detailed analysis of deployment problems, while highlighting the impacting factors, the common assumptions and models adopted in the literature, as well as performance criteria for evaluation purposes. Different deployment algorithms for area, barrier, and points of interest are studied and classified according to their characteristics and properties.

40|$|Abstract In Papuan {{languages}} like Wambon and Urim demonstrative {{forms are}} used both in contexts of referent identification, e. g. as demonstrative operators in noun phrases, and in topicality contexts, e. g. as topic markers with adverbial clauses and phrases, <b>recapitulative</b> clauses, new topic NPs and given topic NPs. Using notions from the Functional Grammar framework (Dik, 1989), I present a non-unified {{account of the}} demonstrative forms: helping the addressee to identify referents by giving deictic hints like ‘close to speaker’ and orienting the addressee about the topical cohesion of the discourse are two separate functional domains in language. This ‘two-domain’ hypothesis, which views the demonstrative forms as having two synchronically unrelated functions, explains {{the fact that in}} Wambon and Urim the demonstratives show important differences in form and behaviour depending on whether they are used for referent identification or for expressing topicality distinctions. The ‘two-domain’ hypothesis explains such formal differences but cannot explain the formal similarities between topic markers and demonstrative operators in Papuan languages like Wambon and Urim. To explain these formal similarities I suggest a diachronic development: in several Papuan languages topic markers developed from demonstrative operators. In the relatively well-documented Awyu-family of Papuan languages this process can be traced: in Wambon, the resumptive demonstrative pronoun- eve integrated in the preceding NP as a topic marker in stative clauses with a very transparant dichotomous topic-comment structure. In Korowai, also of the Awyu-family, the clitic -efè, function as a demonstrative operator and functions solely as a topic marker...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{which has}} not been {{published}} before, the late Prof. du Plessis lays bare the philosophical roots of the liberal-democratic state, or the legal state, as he preferred to call it. After a <b>recapitulative</b> version of the theory of the legal state, het indicates the origin of this form in Greek philosophy and in Medieval thought. The stress, however, is on the Modem Era, in which he distinuishes two main periods {{in the development of the}} theory of the legal state: the jusnaturalistic period and the positivistic or formal period. He argues that positivism has destroyed the original ideal o f individual freedom in facts by regarding justice as a purely formal matter susceptible to any content. All guarantees for individual freedom which rested on a universal normative system fe ll away. The state defines its own competence and limits itself to legal forms in all its activities. The legal state thus merely becomes the state, any state as determined by fixed rules o f its own making to which it binds itselfin all its functioning. Law sinks to a mere form in which the juristic personality of the state manifests its supremacy, and from this there is only one step to the concept that the state is identical with law, so that any state necessarily is a legal state, and any state action which is formally correct, is legal. The article concludes with a brief representation o f the author’s own political and legal vision. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{mammary gland}} {{is a complex}} organ, relying upon {{multiple}} cell types and signalling pathways to orchestrate its predominantly postnatal development. To obtain a detailed understanding of such development, and also the mechanisms whose deregulation lead to mammary tumourigenesis, a physiologically relevant, quantifiable and qualitative model system is required. In vitro, currently available mammary culture systems have allowed studies into prospective stem cell populations, cell-cell interactions, differentiation, proliferation, paracrine networks and hormonal responses, but are limited in {{the degree to which}} they can truly recapitulate in vivo mammary biology. Three dimensional organoid culture systems from many tissues have recently been shown to concurrently allow sustained stem-cell maintenance, proliferation and functional differentiation; however, no such <b>recapitulative</b> in vitro model currently exists for the mammary gland. This thesis therefore details the development of a novel murine mammary organoid culture system. Culture conditions described, including R-Spondin 1 and Neuregulin 1, enable the development and expansion of mammary epithelial organoids for up to 2. 5 months in culture. Organoids possess distinct basal and luminal compartments - functional steroid receptors in the latter allowing hormonal responses - and regenerative cell populations enabling mammary gland reconstitution in vivo. Additional conditions are also described promoting the growth of abnormal, tumour-like organoids. Utilisation of the organoid model allowed the study of key signalling pathways associated with mammary development; most notably revealing the critical importance of the Wnt signalling pathway in regulating normal development, its role in mammary tumourigenesis and demonstrating its potential as a target in anti-tumour therapy. Cell-cell signalling, individual cell populations and behaviours, and tumour organoid growth were studied, the latter offering a platform in which to study potential therapeutic compounds. Evidence provided furthers the understanding of mammary biology and supports that the organoid model comprises a suitable physiologically relevant tool for use in mammary research and drug discovery...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to look into, and to describe, the development and merit of the Sepedi essay-oeuvre. The works taken into account are the essay collections that were published from 1943 to 1996. At the same time, the various sub-genres of the essay are described. These works are also appraised according to merit, {{in order to be}} able to illustrate the evolution of the genre. In order to succeed herein, the researcher has to describe, interpret, classify, and evaluate these works. The descriptive frame of reference used here is the one that has been established by the Department of African Languages, and which is an adapted model of the narratological. Here, three levels are distinguished, namely: (a) the narrative material where the subject is the primary concept; (b) the strategy of composition where the theme concept is especially relevant; and (c) the stylistic finishing of the work in which the author implants his own view of the matters therein. Before the investigation could be tackled formally, the road had to be traversed on what had been done previously on the essay in Sepedi. The articles of Groenewald and Mojalefa respectively, as well as the dissertation of Mohlala, covered only a scanty area of the total field of investigation. The essay concept is then defined. This necessarily led to a description of the genesis of this genre. Here short reference is made to the early French art of the essay. At this point the essay in English is also mentioned, primarily because of the connection to the essayist in Sepedi. The distinction between the formal and the informal essay is briefly discussed, after which we focus our research primarily on the latter. Because the essay, akin to the short story and the sketch, forms part of the art of the pithy, the difference between these three narrative forms is comprehensively elucidated. The various essays are then considered. The narrative material is summarised. The composition of material is discussed under the following headings: (a) The title; (b) the introduction; (c) the elaboration of the data; and (d) the recapitulation. According to these, three distinct categories of essay are differentiated, namely (a) the pioneering phase, (b) the experimental phase and (c) the phase of maturity. The essays of Matlala are classified in the first phase; in the second phase the labours of Masemola, Mojapelo, Tlooke and Mangokwane, then the essays of Mahapa, Mabitje, Selwalekwanadi, Makopo, Phala and Chupyane are grouped in the third phase. In the final, <b>recapitulative</b> chapter, the particular merits of (a) Matlala and Chupyane and (b) Mahapa and Mabitje are investigated. In the former, the versatility of Matlala and Chupyane is discussed, especially with respect to the wide range of types of essay that they wrote. Mahapa and Mabitje are then considered as essay innovators: first for the use of metaphor in the composition of the tale and, secondly, because the essays of both are presented in sequences, a fresh practice that enriches the traditional craft of the essay.

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to analyse and newly evaluate {{one of the last}} M. K. Čiurlionis’ music compositions – the symphonic poem “Dies irae”. First of all, the role of liturgical sequence of the middle ages “Dies irae” is described in the context of Christian culture of Europe. Then the adaptations of the sequence in music of European composers (especially of romantic epoch) are presented. It is noted that the usage of “Dies irae” sequence in music compositions of Hector Berlioz, Ferenc Liszt and Sergei Rachmaninov was directly related to the idea of fatality, pain and death. One of the most typical examples is the Symphonic poem “preludes” by Liszt which embodies a philosophical view of Alphonse de Lamartine. Some aspects of Čiurlionis’ creative process related to destiny, eternity and death are revealed in this context. The influence of painter Arnold Böcklin to the formation of Čiurlionis’ philosophical views and its expression not only in painting but also in music is emphasized. The painting “Isle of the Dead” by Böcklin influenced many artists {{at the end of the}} 19 th century. Čiurlionis also admired Böcklin. He saw the painting “Isle of the Dead” for the first time in Leipzig, May 1902. It was the 5 th version of the painting (1886) with brighter-coloured sky and sea, slightly lacking the mournful serenity of the earlier versions. In the same year Čiurlionis listened to the Symphony No. 2 by Hans Huber and was left disappointed. This means that Čiurlionis was already well acquainted with many Böcklin’s paintings and felt the sense of it deeper than Hubert. Influence of Böcklin to Čiurlionis is seen in postcards he has sent to his brother Povilas – Čiurlionis has used not only reproduction of Böcklin’s “Prometheus” but also his own picture “Serenity” which is very similar to Böcklin in its composition and expressed mood. Cycle of paintings “Funeral symphony”, first part of tryptic “Rex” and painting “Night” are also influenced by Böcklin as it is described by art critics A. Savickas and V. Landsbergis. Influence of Böcklin in Čiurlionis’ music is not so evident. Here it is possible to talk about such influence only on very general level and partly expressed ideas of death, fatality and eternity. Nevertheless Čiurlionis titled some of his late symphonic poems as “Creation of the World”, “Dies irae” which links our mind with basic ideas of human life. The genesis of the symphonic poem “Dies irae” is analysed for the first time. Reasons and circumstances of disappearance of the poem from the research discourse during the 20 th century are also explained. The first question concerns the date when the symphonic poem was composed. A signed date of 1 February 1910 at the end of the score means only the final date when the manuscript was finished. Another composition written in the same manuscript book before “Dies irae” is the symphonic poem “Creation of the World” dated 15 March 1907, Warsaw. So it is possible that the symphonic poem “Dies irae” was created between 1907 and 1910 and only rewritten into one manuscript book together with previous compositions on 1 February 1910. In the analysis of the symphonic poem thematic and structural features are presented together with the explanation of new principles of music composition – the specific way to organize musical elements according to the principles of visual art.
