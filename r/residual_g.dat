40|$|The {{changes in}} signal {{transduction}} {{associated with the}} acquisition of specific cell fates remain poorly understood. We performed massive parallel assessment of kinase signatures of the radiations of the hematopoietic system, including long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC), short-term repopulating HSC (ST-HSC), immature natural killer (iNK) cells, NK cells, B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells. The LT-HSC kinome is characterized by noncanonical Wnt, Ca 2 +and classical protein kinase C (PKC) -driven signaling, which is lost upon the transition to ST-HSC, whose kinome signature prominently features receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation of the Ras/MAPK signaling cassette. Further differentiation to iNK maintains signaling through this cassette but simultaneously leads to activation of a PI 3 K/PKB/Rac signaling, which becomes the dominant trait in the kinase signature following full differentiation toward NK cells. Differentiation along the myeloid and B cell lineages is accompanied by hyperactivation of both the Ras/MAPK and PI 3 K/PKB/Rac signaling cassette. T cells, however, deactivate signaling and only display <b>residual</b> <b>G</b> protein-coupled pathways. Thus, differentiation along the hematopoietic lineage is associated with major remodelling of cellular kinase signature...|$|E
40|$|In budding yeast, many {{genes are}} induced {{early in the}} cell cycle. Induction of these genes has been {{predominantly}} attributed to two transcription factors, Swi 4 -Swi 6 (SBF) and Mbp 1 -Swi 6 (MBF). Swi 4 and Mbp 1 are related DNA-binding proteins with dissimilar target sequences. For most G 1 /S-regulated genes that we tested in a cdc 20 block-release protocol for cell-cycle synchronization, removal of both Swi 4 and Mbp 1 was necessary and sufficient to essentially eliminate cell-cycle-regulated expression. Detectable SBF or MBF binding sites (SCBs or MCBs) in the promoters or available genome-wide promoter occupancy data do not consistently explain this functional overlap. The overlapping ability of these transcription factors to regulate many promoters with very similar cell-cycle kinetics may provide robustness to the G 1 /S transcriptional response, but poses a puzzle with respect to promoter-transcription factor specificity. In addition, for some genes, deletion of Mbp 1 or Swi 4 enhances transcription, suggesting that these factors can also function as transcriptional repressors. Finally, we observe <b>residual</b> <b>G</b> 1 /S transcriptional regulation {{in the absence of}} Swi 4 and Mbp 1...|$|E
40|$|In budding yeast, RAD 9 and RAD 24 /RAD 17 /MEC 3 are {{believed}} to function upstream of MEC 1 and RAD 53 in signalling the presence of DNA damage.

We have shown previously that RAD 9 also controls the transcriptional induction of a DNA damage regulon (DDR). We now report that efficient DDR induction requires all the above-mentioned checkpoint genes. Residual induction of the DDR after UV irradiation observed in all single mutants is not detectable in rad 9 Delta-rad 24 Delta. We have examined the G 2 /M checkpoint and UV sensitivity of single mutants after overexpression of the checkpoint proteins. This analysis indicates that RAD 9 and the RAD 24 epistasis group can be placed onto two separate, additive branches that converge on MEC 1 and RAD 53. Furthermore, MEC 3 appears to function downstream of RAD 24 /RAD 17. The transcriptional response to DNA damage revealed unexpected and specific antagonism between RAD 9 and RAD 24. Further support for genetic interaction between RAD 9 and RAD 24 comes from study of the modification and activation of Rad 53 after damage.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the poor regulation of water loss after leaf development at high relative air humidity (RH), {{the relative importance of}} the physiological and anatomical components was analyzed focusing on cultivars with a contrasting sensitivity to elevated RH. The stomatal responsiveness to three closing stimuli (desiccation, abscisic acid feeding, light/dark transition), as well as several stomatal features (density, index, size and pore dimensions) and the cuticular transpiration rate (CTR) were determined in four rose cultivars, grown under moderate (60 %) and high (95 %) RH. Moreover, the effects of changes in stomatal density and pore dimensions on the stomatal conductance (gs) were quantified using {{a modified version of the}} Brown and Escombe equation. Higher water loss, as a result of plant growth at high RH, was primarily caused by an increase in <b>residual</b> <b>gs,</b> and to a lesser extent due to higher CTR. It was estimated that in leaflets subjected to desiccation the enhanced gs in high RH- as compared to moderate RH-grown plants was mostly due to poor stomatal functionality and to a lesser extent the combined result of higher stomatal density and longer pore length. It is concluded that the reduced degree and, specially, the reduced rate of stomatal closure are the primary causes of the large genotypic variation in the control of water loss in high RH-grown plants. Furthermore, it was found that although changes in stomatal length have no influence on stomatal functionality, changed anatomical features per se represent a significant and direct contribution to the increased water loss...|$|R

Although the southwest-directed regime is also characterized by a good mixing, there is no real link with bed shear stresses (hydrodynamics). Therefore, it is suggested that the nature of particles in suspension also must be regarded. The finer, soft (cohesive) sediments are likely to be suspended more or longer compared to the more sandy sediments, which will settle more easily.
