However participatory processes drawing upon stakeholders from traditionally empowered backgrounds may provide the means of removing empowerment from stakeholders. Such an outcome would be in contradiction to the claims that participatory processes improve both inclusivity and sustainability. In order to form {{an understanding of the}} sources through which empowerment may be removed, an analytical perspective has been developed deriving from Lukesï¿½s views of power dating from 1974. This perspective considers the concept of depotentia as the removal of ï¿½power toï¿½ without speculating upon the underlying intent and also provides for the multidimensionality of power to be examined within a single study. The application of this analytical perspective has been tested upon findings of the government-commissioned report of the Countryside and Community Research Unit in 2005. The survey and report investigated the progress of Local Access Forums in England created in response to the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.

For the first time in beta cells these data integrate distinct pathways associated with beta cell dysfunction. Second, regulation of NOX- 1 in beta cells involves feed-forward control linked to elevated ROS and Src-kinase activation. This potentially results in unbridled ROS generation and identifies candidate targets for pharmacologic intervention. Third, consideration is provided of new, first-in-class, selective inhibitors of NOX- 1. These compounds could have an important role in assessing a disruption of NOX- 1 /ROS signaling as a new approach to preserve and protect beta cell mass in diabetes...|$|E

40|$|This study {{integrated}} {{risk-benefit analysis}} with prospect theory {{with the overall}} objective of identifying the type of management behavior represented by farmers ’ choices of mastitis con-trol options (MCOs). Two exploratory factor analyses, based on 163 and 175 Swedish farmers, respectively, highlighted attitudes to MCOs related to: (1) grouping cows and applying milk-ing order to prevent spread of existing infection and (2) working in a precautionary way to prevent mastitis occurring. This was interpreted as being based on (1) reactive management behavior on detection of udder-health problems in individual cows and (2) proactive man-agement behavior to prevent mastitis developing. Farmers ’ assessments of these MCOs {{were found to be}} based on asymmetrical evaluations of risks and benefits, suggesting that farmers’ management behavior depends on their individual reference point. In particular, attitudes to MCOs related to grouping cows and applying milking order {{to prevent the spread of}} mastitis once infected cows were detected were stronger in the risk domain than in the benefit domain, in accordance with loss aversion. In contrast, attitudes to MCOs related to working in a pre-cautionary way to prevent cows from becoming infected in the first place were stronger in the benefit domain than in the risk domain, in accordance with <b>reverse</b> <b>loss</b> aversion.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{consensus}} and recognition among scientists that coral reefs are globally threatened and that decades {{of efforts to}} protect and manage reefs have largely failed to slow or reverse declines in abundance, diversity, and habitat structure. Attempts to stabilize and <b>reverse</b> <b>loss</b> of biodiversity will require radical changes in assessment and management activities. Many marine conservation efforts employ a variety of 2 ̆ 2 hotspot 2 ̆ 2 paradigms to distinguish areas of exceptional biodiversity that become focal points for conservation and protection. Emerging research suggests that various hotspot concepts and other traditional biogeographic paradigms commonly incorporated in reef conservation and management decisions must be reconsidered. An alternative predictive model based on cladistic biogeography of endocommensal coral reef crustaceans suggests that areas of exceptional diversity {{may be the result}} of accumulation into areas rather than dispersal out of supposed centers of origin. Biogeographic patterns in reefs appear more congruent with geotectonic assembly processes that accumulate species into 2 ̆ 2 composite 2 ̆ 2 areas of lineage-based diversity. This alternate model both confirms areas of high diversity and infers where similar situations may occur in other reef systems. This alternate scenario contradicts the reigning paradigms of vicariance and dispersal commonly used in marine conservation efforts. Hypotheses of biogeographic patterns of reef biodiversity defined by phylogenies are testable and provide contrary explanations to hotspot theories of coral reef conservation. It is essential that accurate information on the type and level of diversity in reef organisms be utilized in forward-looking coral reef research conservation efforts...|$|E

Rats were treated with 5, 100, and 600 mmol/kg of AR-M 100390 for 3 and/or 7 days; another group of rats treated with 600 mmol/kg of compound were allowed to recover for 14 days. AR-M 100390 (600 mmol/kg) caused vacuolation in the b-cell of the rat pancreas that was associated with depletion of insulin and hyperglycemia after 7 days of dosing. The loss of insulin by AR-M 100390 was due to specific inhibition of rat insulin 2 mRNA transcription in vivo. Insulin depletion and hyperglycemia were reversible. The effects of AR-M 100390 in rats were reproduced in the rat pancreatic b-cell line RINm 5 F, where it inhibited intracellular insulin content and secretion without affecting cell survival. Loss of insulin in vitro was also a result of specific inhibition of insulin 2 mRNA transcription and was reversible.

40|$|The Theoretical and Applied Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (TAFLab) at the University of California, Berkeley is {{investigating}} several designs for novel shallow water wave energy converters. The common denominator for these prototypes {{is that they}} operate with a hydraulic power takeoff (PTO) for the secondary power conversion. A critical component of an hydraulic PTO is one or more check valves creating a unidirectional flow. The research goal of this thesis is the flow optimization of these components. Turbulence in the check valves {{was assumed to be}} a major cause for efficiency losses in the current PTO design. Computer Aided Design (CAD) and rapid prototyping through Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) were selected as prototyping tools, due to the high customizability and short lead time of components. Experimental analysis and fluid simulations were used to compare and verify the performance of the optimized check valve designs. One of the performance measures for check valves is the head loss coefficient Kv, which is desired to be low in the flow direction, and high in the reverse direction. We observed that the original check valve had a KvD = 57. 2 +- 1. 0 in the flow direction and no flow in the reverse direction (KvR = inf). A minor modification improved KvD to 46. 1 +- 0. 9 in the flow direction but decreased KvR = 8. 7 +- 1. 7. 10 E 7 in the reverse direction. The first double door design brought KvD down to 6. 4 +- 0. 5, but with a <b>reverse</b> <b>loss</b> coefficient of 738 +- 11. The final double door check valve had a KvD of 8. 4 +- 0. 5 in the flow direction and KvR = 1. 4 +- 0. 3. 10 E 6 in the reverse direction, and was selected for a dynamic test. In a direct application in a pumping setup, we however observed an efficiency decrease from 41. 3 +- 0. 5 % to 24. 7 +- 0. 5 %, possibly explained by the closing speeds of the new valve. It is concluded that optimizing losses in a steady state flow experiment cannot guarantee improved results in pulsating or alternating flow...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionAccumulating {{evidence}} suggests that both levels and activity of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR) are dramatically influenced by growth-factor receptor (GFR) signaling pathways, and that this crosstalk is {{a major determinant of}} both breast cancer progression and response to therapy. The phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) pathway, a key mediator of GFR signaling, {{is one of the most}} altered pathways in breast cancer. We thus examined whether deregulated PI 3 K signaling in luminal ER+ breast tumors is associated with ER level and activity and intrinsic molecular subtype. MethodsWe defined two independent molecular signatures of the PI 3 K pathway: a proteomic (reverse-phase proteomic array) PI 3 K signature, based on protein measurement for PI 3 K signaling intermediates, and a PI 3 K transcriptional (mRNA) signature based on the set of genes either induced or repressed by PI 3 K inhibitors. By using these signatures, we scored each ER+ breast tumor represented in multiple independent expression-profiling datasets (four mRNA, n = 915; one protein, n = 429) for activation of the PI 3 K pathway. Effects of PI 3 K inhibitor BEZ- 235 on ER expression and activity levels and cell growth were tested by quantitative real-time PCR and cell proliferation assays. ResultsWithin ER+ tumors, ER levels were negatively correlated with the PI 3 K activation scores, both at the proteomic and transcriptional levels, in all datasets examined. PI 3 K signature scores were also higher in ER+ tumors and cell lines of the more aggressive luminal B molecular subtype versus those of the less aggressive luminal A subtype. Notably, BEZ- 235 treatment in four different ER+ cell lines increased expression of ER and ER target genes including PR, and treatment with IGF-I (which signals via PI 3 K) decreased expression of ER and target genes, thus further establishing an inverse functional relation between ER and PI 3 K. BEZ- 235 had an additional effect on tamoxifen in inhibiting the growth of a number of ER+ cell lines. ConclusionsOur data suggest that luminal B tumors have hyperactive GFR/PI 3 K signaling associated with lower ER levels, which has been correlated with resistance to endocrine therapy. Targeting PI 3 K in these tumors might <b>reverse</b> <b>loss</b> of ER expression and signaling and restore hormonal sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The figure {{depicts a}} traveling-wave ruby maser {{that has been}} {{designed}} (though not yet implemented in hardware) {{to serve as a}} low-noise amplifier for reception of weak radio signals in the frequency band of 31. 8 to 32. 3 GHz. The design offers significant improvements over previous designs of 32 -GHz traveling-wave masers. In addition, relative to prior designs of 32 -GHz amplifiers based on high-electron-mobility transistors, this design affords higher immunity to radio-frequency interference and lower equivalent input noise temperature. In addition to the basic frequency-band and low-noise requirements, the initial design problem included a requirement for capability of operation in a closed-cycle helium refrigerator at a temperature. 4 K and a requirement that the design be mechanically simplified, relative to prior designs, in order to minimize the cost of fabrication and assembly. Previous attempts to build 32 - GHz traveling-wave masers involved the use of metallic slow-wave structures comprising coupled transverse electromagnetic (TEM) -mode resonators that were subject to very tight tolerances and, hence, were expensive to fabricate and assemble. Impedance matching for coupling signals into and out of these earlier masers was very difficult. A key feature of the design is a slow-wave structure, the metallic portions of which would be mechanically relatively simple in that, unlike in prior slow-wave structures, there would be no internal metal steps, irises, or posts. The metallic portions of the slow-wave structure would consist only of two rectangular metal waveguide arms. The arms would contain sections filled with the active material (ruby) alternating with evanescent-wave sections. This structure would be transparent in both the signal-frequency band (the aforementioned range of 31. 8 to 32. 3 GHz) and the pump-frequency band (65. 75 to 66. 75 GHz), and would impose large slowing factors in both frequency bands. Resonant ferrite isolators would be placed in the evanescent-wave sections to provide <b>reverse</b> <b>loss</b> needed to suppress reverse propagation of power at the signal frequency. This design is expected to afford a large gain-bandwidth product at the signal frequency and efficient coupling of the pump power into the paramagnetic spin resonances of the ruby sections.
