25|$|Onyango's {{immigration}} status became {{the subject of}} widespread international media attention in the final week of the 2008 U.S. presidential election, in which her half-nephew Obama was the Democratic candidate. Based on anonymous government sources, Associated Press reported that Onyango was living in the United States without valid {{immigration status}}; she had been asked to leave in 2004 after her request for asylum was denied by an immigration judge. Although such an order from a judge can be appealed, it was unknown if Onyango had appealed the order. Onyango's case resulted in a special nationwide directive within Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) requiring any deportations to be approved at the level of ICE <b>regional</b> <b>directors</b> before the U.S presidential election. In discussing Onyango's case, various media outlets discussed some of the issues of immigrants, including political asylum cases.|$|E
25|$|The Smith bill won several early {{tests in}} the House, which also voted to {{substantially}} cut the NLRB's budget. Smith won a snap vote in the House Rules Committee permitting him to bring his bill directly to {{the floor for a}} vote and bypass the committee process (where Roosevelt and his House allies had intended to bottle up the bill). In an attempt to defuse the legislative crisis, Madden fired 53 staff and forced another five to resign, and decentralized the NLRB's trial process to give <b>regional</b> <b>directors</b> and field agents more authority. But the House easily passed the Smith bill by a vote of 258 to 129 on June 7, 1940. To protect the NLRB, Roosevelt convinced Senator Elbert D. Thomas, chair of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, to hold no hearings or votes on the bill, and the legislation died.|$|E

500|$|Numeraries, {{the second}} largest type of the {{faithful}} of Opus Dei, comprise about 20% of total membership. Numeraries are celibate members who give themselves in [...] "full availability" [...] (plena disponibilitas) for the official undertakings of the Prelature. [...] This includes full availability for giving doctrinal and ascetical formation to other members, for staffing the internal government of Opus Dei if asked by the <b>regional</b> <b>directors,</b> and for moving to other countries to start or help with apostolic activities if asked by the Prelate. [...] Because they are making themselves fully available to do whatever {{needs to be done}} for the undertakings of the Prelature, numeraries are expected to live in special centers run by Opus Dei, and the question of which particular center a numerary will live in depends upon the regional needs. [...] "" [...] is a general term for persons who form part of the permanent staff of an organization. Therefore in order to maintain a family atmosphere in the centers (rather than an institutional one), it is considered very important for numeraries to participate in daily meals and [...] "get-togethers" [...] in which they converse and share news. [...] Both men and women may become numeraries in Opus Dei, although the centers are strictly gender-segregated. Numeraries generally have jobs outside of Opus Dei, although some are asked to work internally full-time and many modify the way that they go about their professional goals in order to be available for the Prelature. They devote the bulk of their income to the organization.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{election}} of Jerald Johnson as a general superintendent in June 1980, the General Board elected L. Guy Nees as his replacement. During his six years of leadership, Nees appointed directors {{for each of the}} six missions regions, who supervised the establishment of administrative offices in each region. The 2nd Commission on Internationalization recommended that <b>regional</b> <b>directors</b> should be born in the region, but this recommendation has never been implemented fully. The 1985 General Assembly allowed [...] "cultural adaptations of local, district, and regional church government procedures", approved the creation of regional advisory councils and conferences, and national administrative boards. In 1989 the 3rd Commission recommended that the Church of the Nazarene should be a [...] "denomination of districts (not nations)", and that districts and regions should follow geographical rather than racial or ethnic lines. The 1989 General Assembly stated three principles for internationalization: [...] "(1) shared mission; (2) national identity; and (3) indigenization"; prohibited districts being constituted on the basis of ethnicity; explicitly rejected the idea of a commonwealth or federation of the denomination, in favour of it being a [...] "global family"; and created a Commission on the International Church.|$|E
2500|$|As the UAW {{executive}} board gathered {{to make its}} decision, the race had shifted and Bieber appeared to have majority support on the board. Bieber appeared to have gained ground {{because he was a}} compromise candidate acceptable to both the Ephlin and Majerus camps. Some board members appear to have preferred Bieber because he came from the GM Department, the union's largest. Majerus, however, had nearly as much support. Press reports indicated that Ephlin had a chance, if the board deadlocked over Bieber and Majerus. The board voted for Bieber as its preferred nominee. Union insiders later described the {{executive board}}'s choice as a surprise. None of the three candidates received a majority on the first ballot. Ephlin, who had the least number of votes, withdrew from the race, and the board voted 15 to 11 to support Bieber. (Press reports later described this as [...] "unusually close".) Majerus withdrew, and the board took a third ballot to make its decision unanimous (a tradition within the union). The Steering Committee ratified the executive board's decision shortly thereafter. Bieber's campaigning among the <b>regional</b> <b>directors,</b> who formed a majority on the executive board, swung the election in his favor.|$|E
