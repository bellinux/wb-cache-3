5|$|The Illawarra Line commences at Illawarra Junction at Redfern {{and travel}} on the 'Illawarra' (eastern pair) tracks. A dive tunnel allows Intercity {{services}} from the South Coast Line to cross underneath the main suburban lines to access Central station. The Illawarra lines are also connected {{at this point}} to the Illawarra <b>Relief</b> <b>Lines</b> which emerge from underground and lead to the Eastern Suburbs Line.|$|E
25|$|In August 2008 it was {{announced}} that a number of speed limits on the <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> between Reading and London have been raised so that 86% of the line can be used at , however the time allowed between stations for trains running on the <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> has been reduced in the December 2008 timetable to improve timekeeping.|$|E
25|$|The {{cost of the}} <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> is {{estimated}} at C$6.2 billion to 8.3 billion depending on alignment and phasing. The <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> {{is included in the}} regional transportation plan The Big Move, and is one of Metrolinx's top 15 transit priorities.|$|R
50|$|Keneally's plan {{abandoned}} the rapid transit concept altogether {{in favour of}} extensions to the existing heavy rail network, starting with a so-called CBD <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> to reduce congestion at city-centre stations. Keneally lost office {{just over a year}} later, with the <b>relief</b> <b>line</b> unbuilt.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> {{disappeared}} from transit plans {{soon after the}} province delayed approving Metropolitan Toronto's Network 2011 plan. The provincial government was alarmed over the construction cost and withdrew political support for the new line. There have been no serious plans for the <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> {{for the next two}} decades.|$|R
25|$|Between London and Didcot {{there are}} four tracks, two for each direction. The main lines are mostly used by the faster trains and are {{on the south side}} of the route. The <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> on the north side are used for slower {{services}} and those that need to call at all stations as only London Paddington, Slough, Maidenhead, Twyford, Reading and Didcot Parkway stations have platforms on the main lines (although a few others have main line platforms that can be used in an emergency). Between Didcot and Royal Wootton Bassett there are a series of passing loops lines to allow fast trains to overtake slower ones. This section is also signalled for bi-directional running on each line but this facility is usually only used during engineering working or when there is significant disruption to traffic in one direction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{line speed}} is [...] The <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> from Paddington to Didcot {{are limited to}} [...] as far as Reading, and then [...] to Didcot. Lower {{restrictions}} apply at various locations. The line {{is one of two}} Network Rail-owned lines equipped with the Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system, the other being the Chiltern Main Line.|$|E
50|$|In August 2008 it was {{announced}} that a number of speed limits on the <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> between Reading and London have been raised so that 86% of the line can be used at 90 mph, however the time allowed between stations for trains running on the <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> has been reduced in the December 2008 timetable to improve timekeeping.|$|E

25|$|The TTC {{released}} the Network 2011 plan in 1985, and a <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> {{was one of}} the three routes proposed. As part of the 2011 Network plan, the <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> was proposed to run between Pape station on the Bloorâ€“Danforth line, south to Eastern Avenue, and then west to Union Station, the Rogers Centre (then known as the SkyDome) and Spadina Avenue.|$|R

5000|$|There are hourly {{services}} on Sundays, {{which do not}} call at [...] Unusually for a station on the Great Western Main Line, Burnham was built with platforms that serve only the <b>relief</b> <b>lines,</b> which makes it vulnerable to losing services when engineering work closes the <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> and leaves trains only on the main lines. Consequently, the station is frequently served by a replacement bus service at night.|$|E
50|$|Freight trains now use the <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> {{from between}} Challow and Wantage Road {{to wait for}} High Speed Trains to {{overtake}} them.|$|E

50|$|In 1912, a <b>relief</b> <b>line</b> {{was opened}} between the #2 and #3 tunnels, but the steep grade caused {{numerous}} problems including stalled trains, damaged engines and breakaways, {{and it was}} soon relegated to storage for disabled trains or portions of trains. The <b>relief</b> <b>line</b> was finally removed in 1934, thus providing room on the formation for further improvements to the alignment for the two main lines some years later.|$|R

5000|$|Platform 6, for {{stopping}} services to London, was {{provided with a}} siding between the main and <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> at {{the east end of}} the station. This was used for storing the local train between services. The siding was removed in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The station opened {{along with}} the line. The service at Marshfield was always modest, with just three trains per day in 1869. <b>Relief</b> <b>lines</b> at Marshfield were {{completed}} in stages between 1896 and 1898. The station had 13 to 14 employees in the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|Keele and Dundas West were {{considered}} potential stations for the northwestern terminus of Phase Two {{of the proposed}} Downtown <b>Relief</b> <b>Line.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two side {{platforms}} (platform 1 on the down main line and platform 4 {{on the up}} <b>relief</b> <b>line)</b> and a central island platform with two faces (platform 2 on the up main line and platform 3 on the down <b>relief</b> <b>line).</b> Platforms 1 and 2 are only used when engineering works cause stopping trains to use the fast tracks, and the platform edges are closed off by fences incorporating normally closed and locked gates.|$|R
50|$|Platform 12, 13, 14 & 15 - (New {{platforms}} on site {{of former}} goods sidings) Down and Up <b>Relief</b> <b>line</b> platforms for stopping services.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{stopping}} service, Heathrow Connect, {{which takes}} the same route but using the slower <b>relief</b> <b>lines,</b> on which significantly lower fares are charged. This takes approximately 15 minutes longer than Heathrow Express, but offers connections to the London Underground Central and District lines at Ealing Broadway.|$|E
50|$|At Twyford, {{the running}} speed is 125 mph {{on the fast}} lines, and 60 mph (90 mph for the Class 165s and Class 166s) on the <b>relief</b> <b>lines.</b> The up relief line is also signalled for wrong {{direction}} running at a speed of 40 mph, or 10 mph for the crossover onto the Henley branch.|$|E
50|$|Three {{years later}} {{it had to}} be rebuilt to allow for the two extra tracks to be laid from Cogload Junction to Taunton, after which the {{platforms}} were only available to the <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> on the outside; trains on the main lines, which were generally running to and from London Paddington, could not call.|$|E
50|$|Like the {{original}} CBD Rail Link proposal, the CBD <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> {{was intended to}} be integrated into the CityRail network. The CBD <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> was proposed to utilise the MetroWest corridor, terminate at Wynyard and link into the Western line. This differed from the CBD Rail Link which utilised the MetroPitt corridor and crossed the harbour to link into the North Shore and Chatswood to Epping lines to the north and either the Airport or Campbelltown Express lines to the south.|$|R

25|$|In May 2017, Toronto Mayor John Tory {{announced}} he would not support planning for the Yonge North Subway Extension {{unless there is a}} funding commitment for the <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> to relieve crowding on Line 1, expected to be at capacity by 2031. If so authorized, city staff could complete 15-30 per cent of the design for both projects, including schedules and better estimates, by the end of 2019. As of May 2017, planning was more advanced for the Yonge extension than for the <b>Relief</b> <b>Line.</b>|$|R
