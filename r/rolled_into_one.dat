5|$|When King {{bought the}} {{painting}} {{it consisted of}} 13 panels sewn together and <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> piece. To more easily store and transport the painting King unstitched the 13 panels and stored them individually together with two separate panels of scenery {{used to make the}} painting a bit longer depending on the exhibition space. The 13 panels along with the two extra scenery panels bring the painting to 410 feet long according to King. The painting has, for the most part, remained rolled up since 1933, though it was donated by King to Wake Forest University upon his death in 1996. The university sold the painting in 2007 to an anonymous group of Raleigh, North Carolina, investors. The painting has been appraised at a value of US$5.5 million, but the value of the sale remains unknown. The group intends to resell the painting to a new buyer who will commit to restoring the work and building a suitable structure to house it.|$|E

[...] Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi-faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress, describing The road Cordelia has travelled, the journey she has taken up to now has been such a joy to play as an actress, because {{there have been so many}} chances to do so many different emotions.

500|$|Critics {{received}} Mega Man well, {{though the}} game sold poorly.

IGN editor Matt Casamassina proclaimed, [...] "Mega Man {{is one of the}} best examples of great graphics, amazing music and near-perfect gameplay <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> cartridge". GameSpot writers Christian Nutt and Justin Speer identified the game as a [...] "winner in gameplay" [...] granted its [...] "low-key presentation". Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com likewise outlined it as a [...] "charming (if slightly rough) start for the series". Whether positive or negative, Mega Man has been commonly received as very difficult. IGN's Casamassina found the game the hardest in the franchise, and among the hardest titles on the NES. IGN's Thomas observed that its combination of high difficulty and short length hurt its replayability. According to 1UP.com, the [...] "Nintendo-hard" [...] Mega Man bosses set the game apart from its two immediate and more popular sequels. Total! retrospectively characterized the game as [...] "an overhard and unenjoyably frustrating platform nightmare".|$|E

She chose to sell the rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood's number one studio, {{on the condition that}} she be the star. As part of the deal she also received the director of her choice, George Cukor, and picked James Stewart and Cary Grant (to whom she ceded top-billing) as co-stars. Before filming began, Hepburn shrewdly noted, [...] "I don't want to make a grand entrance in this picture. Moviegoers... think I'm too la-di-da or something. A {{lot of people want to}} see me fall flat on my face." [...] Thus the film began with Grant knocking the actress flat on her backside. Berg describes how the character was crafted to have audiences [...] "laugh at her enough that they would ultimately sympathize with her", which Hepburn felt was crucial in [...] "recreating" [...] her public image. The Philadelphia Story was one of the biggest hits of 1940, breaking records at Radio City Music Hall. The review in Time declared, [...] "Come on back, Katie, all is forgiven."

500|$|Orr feuded with Toronto rookie defenceman Pat Quinn that season. In a late season game, Orr {{attempted}} {{to knock the}} puck loose from Maple Leafs goaltender Bruce Gamble and Quinn cross-checked Orr to the ice. Orr kicked Quinn and Quinn kicked Orr. On-ice officials broke it up, but the feud continued into the 1969 playoffs. The Bruins {{finished second in the}} NHL's East Division and drew the Maple Leafs in the first round. In the first game, in Boston, Quinn caught Orr with his head down during a rush, and caught him with an open-ice hit, knocking Orr unconscious. Quinn, assessed five minutes for elbowing, was attacked in the penalty box by a fan and Quinn swung at the fan with his stick, breaking the glass. When Quinn returned, the Boston fans showered garbage onto the ice. Orr was carried out on a stretcher to the dressing room where he revived after the concussion. According to a Boston police officer at the scene, [...] "The fans here don't like anybody to touch Orr. He's their Frank Merriwell and Jack Armstrong <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> <b>one.</b> To my thinking, it looked like a clean check."

The Bruins went on to sweep the Maple Leafs before losing in six games to the Montreal Canadiens in the second round. Orr returned for the third game against Toronto, getting two assists as the Bruins won their first games in Toronto since 1965.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{said of the}} Pink Panther films, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, {{though it may be}} because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic {{self-absorption}} that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable—instead of alarming—and finally so funny." [...] Film critic Elvis Mitchell has said that Sellers {{was one of the few}} comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life. A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured that they always retain their dignity. On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said: [...] "I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching." [...] His biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is [...] "the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are." [...] Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers's performances in the Pink Panther films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that [...] "As 'low' and 'high' comedy <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> <b>one,</b> it's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism". This combination of [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was [...] "the sole representative of humanity". Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a [...] "balance between character and absurdity". Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could [...] "inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being".|$|E
