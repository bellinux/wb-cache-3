5|$|<b>Refined</b> {{sugar is}} made from raw sugar that has {{undergone}} a refining process to remove the molasses. Raw sugar is sucrose which is extracted from sugarcane or sugar beet.

5|$|<b>Refined</b> {{sugar is}} widely used for {{industrial}} needs for higher quality. <b>Refined</b> sugar is purer (ICUMSA below 300) than raw sugar (ICUMSA over 1,500).

40|$|The surface {{chemistry}} of eucalyptus pulp fibers {{prior to and}} after low-consistency (LC) <b>refining</b> was studied using a state-of-the art laboratory <b>refining</b> device and advanced surface analysis techniques. It was found that LC <b>refining</b> could generate fines and fibrillation and change the surface chemical composition of fiber surfaces. Both of these two effects can facilitate the adsorption of fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) by the combination of increased specific surface area, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic interactions, thus compensating {{for the loss of}} optical properties resulting from LC <b>refining.</b> The mechanical hydraulic force generated by the high <b>refining</b> energy disturbed the FWA retention. Therefore, high <b>refining</b> energy could improve the adsorption of FWAs when they are added after <b>refining,</b> but for better performance, the <b>refining</b> energy should be controlled and lowered. In addition, small amounts of calcium salt added after <b>refining</b> can also ameliorate the adsorption of FWAs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{mechanical}} <b>refining</b> on the enzymatic digestibility of pretreated corn stover (PCS) was investigated. Low severity, dilute sulfuric acid PCS {{was subjected to}} mechanical <b>refining</b> using a bench-scale food processor blender, a PFI mill, a 12 -inch laboratory disk <b>refiner,</b> and a 25 mm co-rotating twin-screw extruder. Glucose yields from enzymatic hydrolysis were improved by 10 – 15 % after blending and disk <b>refining,</b> while PFI <b>refining</b> and twin-screw extrusion showed a glucose yield improvement of 16 – 20 %. A pilot scale <b>refining</b> test using a Szego mill was performed and showed approximately 10 % improvements in biomass digestibility. This suggests the possibility to scale up a mechanical <b>refining</b> technique to obtain similar enzymatic digestibility glucose yield enhancement as achieved by PFI milling and extrusion technologies.

40|$|The {{requirement}} for high quality pulps which {{are widely used}} in paper industries has increased the demand for pulp <b>refining</b> (beating) process. Pulp <b>refining</b> is a promising approach to improve the pulp quality by changing the fiber characteristics. The diversity {{of research on the}} effect of <b>refining</b> on fiber properties which is due to the different pulp sources, pulp consistency and <b>refining</b> equipment has interested us to provide a review on the studies over the last decade. In this article, the influence of pulp <b>refining</b> on structural properties i. e., fibrillations, fine formation, fiber length, fiber curl, crystallinity and distribution of surface chemical compositions is reviewed. The effect of pulp <b>refining</b> on electrokinetic properties of fiber e. g., surface and total charges of pulps is discussed.

40|$|The loadability of a pulp <b>refiner</b> was studied using <b>refiner</b> data such as gap movement, total power, no-load power, and net <b>refining</b> power. Two {{different}} types of pulp and three {{different types}} of <b>refiner</b> filling {{were used in the}} study. The floc formation and floc size of each pulp was studied in a flow channel simulating filling grooves. The loadability of the pulp <b>refiner</b> was linked to <b>refining</b> effects such as fiber shortening, and internal and external fibrillation. The trapping point of the <b>refiner,</b> and therefore <b>refiner</b> loadability, was found to be more related to fiber characteristics such as fiber length and coarseness, while being less dependent on <b>refining</b> consistency in the range of 2. 0 - 5. 5 %. The data on the formation of flocs and floc size was used to explain the trapping of fibers between <b>refiner</b> bars and the <b>refiner</b> gap width. Filling design characteristics such as groove width and cutting speed affect the gap width and trapping of flocs inside the <b>refiner.</b> Fillings with high cutting speed tend to break flocs composed of long and short fibers at the same rate and therefore both types of floc maintain the same gap width. On the other hand, wide-groove fillings with lower cutting speed have a gentler effect and the differences in fiber characteristics are easily reflected in the gap width and trapping point. Fillings with low cutting speed have a greater straightening effect than fiber cutting, whereas narrow-bar fillings have a more noticeable effect on fiber cutting, external fibrillation, and fiber swelling...|$|R
