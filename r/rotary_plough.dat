The university taught everything and did everything. It had whirling machines on the top of it that measured the speed of the wind, and deep in its basements it measured earthquakes with a seismograph; it held classes on forestry and dentistry and palmistry; it sent life classes into the slums, and death classes to the city morgue. It offered such a vast variety of themes, topics and subjects to the students, that there was nothing that a student was compelled to learn, while from its own presses in its own press-building it sent out a shower of bulletins and monographs like driven snow from a <b>rotary</b> <b>plough.</b>|$|E

40|$|In Italy, {{there has}} been a {{significant}} increase of the areas cultivated with short-rotation forestry (SRF) poplar (Populus spp.) for the production of lignocellulosic biomass. This species has been generally introduced on soils managed with conventional farming practices that {{led to the formation of}} a hardpan. This constitutes a serious obstacle for root development and water availability, which affect the successful establishment of the plantation. To this end the Unit of Agricultural Engineering of the Agricultural Research Council (CRA-ING) has developed a new system for reduced tillage (RT), to be used during the establishment of SRF poplar. This new system aims at breaking the tillage pan and at reducing both traffic intensity and site preparation cost. A new machine has been developed, which is based on a commercial <b>rotary</b> <b>plough,</b> suitably modified by adding a shank subsoiler. This machine can perform both deep soil ripping and surface ploughing in a single pass, treating narrow strips where poplar cuttings are to be planted. The study compared conventional tillage (CT) with RT, showing that latter allowed a dramatic reduction of the number of field operations and of all related problems, while creating better conditions for poplar rooting without meaningful effects on yield...|$|E

The most important units are breakdown trains (for re-railing derailed rolling stock) and <b>rotary</b> snow <b>ploughs.</b> There are also fire fighting trains to enable fires in the area to be put out as quickly as possible. And for the smooth running of a Bahnbetriebswerk tractors and shunters are needed in order to move wagons and locomotives that are unable to move under their own power. Finally almost every Bahnbetriebswerk has a variety of special vehicles.|$|R
40|$|In the French Landes de Gascogne forest, {{the last}} 2009 storm damaged many young stands of Pinus pinaster. The {{susceptibility}} {{of the young}} trees to wind damage mainly depends on the mechanical stability of their root system. An optimal development of the root system allows a better anchorage at the adult age. In sandy soil, tillage could {{be a part of}} the key in the shallow root development because it can add artificial microtopography. To assess the incidence of reafforestation techniques on root system development and to find out which tree structure features are associated to toppling, we selected three neighboring 13 -years old planted stands with different tillage (full ploughing, strip <b>ploughing</b> and <b>rotary</b> <b>ploughing).</b> An inventory of stem leaning and direction of leaning, height and DBH was made. Three trees per toppling level (undamaged, leaning and toppled trees) were sampled in each plot. The root system architecture was measured by 3 D digitizing and microtopography was measured in a radius of 3 m around the trees. The percent of straight trees was significantly more important (37 %) in the full ploughing compare to the other stands (23 %) and the toppled trees were the tallest. After thirteen years, the strip ploughing plot had still a strong microtopography. The circular distribution of the root volume was studied as a proportion in three wind-oriented sectors. Undamaged trees showed a large reinforcement of root volume, length and number in the leeward quarter only, except in the strip plough plot. Larger trees which uproot with a root soil plate show generally a windward and a leeward reinforcement. In these smaller trees, which toppled, leeward roots could not move due to low plasticity of sand, whereas leeward roots were lifted easily in these low cohesion soil. To prevent toppling, reafforestation techniques should not hamper the root development leeward...|$|R
50|$|The {{focus of}} the Neustadt/Weinstrasse Railway Museum is {{vehicles}} of the former state railways in southern Germany. For example, the two remaining examples of steam locomotives {{from the time of}} the Palatine Railways are preserved here still in their original state: the T 1 Schaidt and a Palatine T 5. In addition a replica of an express train locomotive from the early railway period, (Die Pfalz), a Crampton engine, is on display. Vehicles from the Deutsche Reichsbahn era are the E 17 and ET 11. In addition the museum still has a range of passenger train coaches and goods wagons of the former Baden and Royal Württemberg State Railways, as well as the later standard DRG wagons.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} at four sites in Sweden to investigate the possibility of establishing downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) on abandoned fields by natural regeneration, direct seeding or both. The effects of six soil preparation methods on the vegetation cover, seedling survival, dominant seedling height and seedling establishment were studied up to four years after seedling emergence. The methods were: no preparation, ordinary <b>ploughing,</b> <b>rotary</b> cultivation, deep <b>ploughing,</b> soil inversion, removal of topsoil. Five additional treatments were applied: no treatment, herbicide, peat litter, wood ashes, slaked lime. Both a split-plot design and a {{randomised complete block design}} were used. Seedling survival and establishment without preparation, and with rotary cultivation, were close to nil, while the other soil preparation methods generally were more effective. Best seedling survival and establishment were obtained on seedbeds created by removing topsoil or by transposing it by deep ploughing or inversion. These seedbeds also suppressed competing vegetation, compared to seedbeds with topsoil at the surface. Seedling establishment after removal of topsoil, amounting to 8 % of sown germinable seed, was outstanding on sandy soil, but much poorer on silty soil. The tallest dominant seedlings were found on seedbeds with topsoil within the soil profile. Application of peat litter to the seedbed promoted seedling establishment...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of four cultivation treatments viz. <b>ploughing,</b> <b>rotary</b> hoeing, power harrowing and no soil disturbance, {{on the distribution}} of weed seeds in the soil profile was investigated in a field trial. Weed seeds were counted by dry sieving soil samples collected from 0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 15 and 15 - 20 cm depths. The density and species of weeds that emerged in field plots were also recorded at three-weekly intervals. Samples from undisturbed plots showed a linear decline with depth. Ploughing was the only treatment that caused a significant shift of seeds to the deeper profile. Ploughed plots had significantly fewer weed seedlings than other treatments, due to lower numbers of both summer grasses and broadleaf weeds. Undisturbed plots contained significantly fewer broadleaf species, and weed emergence was delayed. Implications of these results for seedbank sampling methodology and weed management strategies are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{requirements}} for raw edible produce like lettuces include nutritional value and hygienic quality. Organic lettuce is often considered {{to cause a}} potential health risk for immunocompromised individuals due to assumed pathogen transfer from organically manured soils into lettuce heads (Lactuca sativa, var. capitata). The effect of different weed management strategies (<b>rotary</b> tiller, mouldboard <b>plough</b> combined with flame weeding, plastic mulch and straw layer, resp.) on pathogen transfer from fresh and composted farm yard manure were assessed in four field experiments in 2006 and 2007. Results gave no hint on any pathogen transfer given by the assumed pathways (contaminated soil particles transported by mechanical tools and/or splash effect of rain drops). Nitrate contents in lettuce were low ranging from 269 mg/kg to 828 mg/kg in fresh matter respectively. A new method for measuring leaf tissue firmness is being developed by using an artificial denture. Substantial negative effects of manure on lettuce quality were not recorded...|$|R
40|$|Investigations were {{conducted}} during the 2003, 2004 and 2005 growing seasons in northern Greece to evaluate effects of tillage regime (mouldboard plough, chisel <b>plough</b> and <b>rotary</b> tiller), cropping sequence (continuous cotton, cotton-sugar beet rotation and continuous tobacco) and herbicide treatment on weed seedbank dynamics. Amaranthus spp. and Portulaca oleracea were the most abundant species, ranging from 76 % to 89 % of total weed seeds found in 0 - 15 and 15 - 30 cm soil depths during the 3 years. With the mouldboard plough, 48 % and 52 % of the weed seedbank {{was found in the}} 0 - 15 and 15 - 30 cm soil horizons, while approximately 60 % was concentrated in the upper 15 cm soil horizon for chisel <b>plough</b> and <b>rotary</b> tillage. Mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> significantly buried more Echinochloa crus-galli seeds in the 15 - 30 cm soil horizon compared with the other tillage regimes. Total seedbank (0 - 30 cm) of P. oleracea was significantly reduced in cotton-sugar beet rotation compared with cotton and tobacco monocultures, while the opposite occurred for E. crus-galli. Total seed densities of most annual broad-leaved weed species (Amaranthus spp., P. oleracea, Solanum nigrum) and E. crus-galli were lower in herbicide treated than in untreated plots. The results suggest that in light textured soils, conventional tillage with herbicide use gradually reduces seed density of small seeded weed species in the top 15 cm over several years. In contrast, crop rotation with the early established sugar beet favours spring-germinating grass weed species, but also prevents establishment of summer-germinating weed species by the early developing crop canopy...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen- 15 enriched {{ammonium}} sulphate {{was applied to}} micro-plots in a field in which two leguminous (white clover and peas) and two non-leguminous (ryegrass and winter wheat) crops were grown to produce ¹⁵N-labelled crop residues and roots during 1993 / 94. Nitrogen benefits and recovery of crop residue-N, root-N and residual fertilizer-N by three succeeding winter wheat crops were studied. Each crop residue was subjected to four different residue management treatments (<b>ploughed,</b> <b>rotary</b> hoed, mulched or burned) before the first sequential wheat crop (1994 / 95) was sown, followed by the second (1995 / 96) and third wheat crops (1996 / 97), in each of which residues of the previous wheat crop were removed and all plots were ploughed uniformly before sowing. Grain yields of the first sequential wheat crop followed the order: white clover > peas > ryegrass > wheat. The mulched treatment produced significantly lower grain yield than those of other treatments. In the first sequential wheat crop, leguminous and non-leguminous residues supplied between 29 – 57 % and 6 – 10 % of wheat N accumulated respectively and these decreased with successive sequential crops. Rotary hoed treatment reduced N benefits of white clover residue-N while {{no significant differences in}} N benefits occurred between residue management treatments in non-leguminous residues. On average, the first wheat crop recovered between 29 – 37 % of leguminous and 11 – 13 % of non-leguminous crop residues-N. Corresponding values for root plus residual fertilizer-N were between 5 – 19 % and 2 – 3 %, respectively. Management treatments produced similar effects to those of N benefits. On average, between 5 to 8 % of crop residue-N plus root and residual fertilizer-N was recovered by each of the second and third sequential wheat crops from leguminous residues compared to 2 to 4 % from non-leguminous residues. The N recoveries tended to be higher under mulched treatments especially under leguminous than non-leguminous residues for the second sequential wheat crop but were variable for the third sequential wheat crop. Relatively higher proportions of leguminous residue-N were unaccounted in <b>ploughed</b> and <b>rotary</b> hoed treatments compared with those of mulched and burned treatments. In non-leguminous residue-N, higher unaccounted residue-N occurred under burned (33 – 44 %) compared with other treatments (20 – 27 %) ...|$|R
40|$|In two {{organically}} cultivated field trials, {{located in}} Germany and Greece, effects of reduced primary tillage systems on root and shoot growth of cereals were investigated. The field trial in Rommersheim near Mainz, Germany, {{was established in}} 1994. A similar experiment was established in 1995 located in Athens, Greece. Mouldboard plough, two-layer plough and layer cultivator were used in Germany. Mouldboard <b>plough,</b> <b>rotary</b> hoe and zero tillage were applied in Greece. The field experiment in Germany was performed on a clay loam soil with a 5 -year crop rotation (green fallow, winter wheat/catch crop, peas, winter rye/catch crop, spring barley) in a split-plot design. The investigated crop was spring barley and winter rye. Tillage systems were implemented after cereal harvests only. The field experiment in Greece was performed on a clay loam soil with a 3 -year crop rotation (cereal, green manure, cotton) and a split-plot design. The test crop was winter wheat. The parameters measured in both field trials were soil physical and chemical parameters, as well as root and shoot parameters of the cereals. In Germany higher tillage intensity implemented on spring barley on one hand reduced aggregate stability and decreased the penetration resistant, especially in lower depths. On the other hand, it increased rooting density, nutrient uptake and crop development. Dry matter production of weeds was significantly lower in the ploughed fields compared with those treated with the cultivator. Correspondingly, higher grain yields were positively correlated with tillage intensity. Positive effects of the cultivator on soil properties (e. g. significant higher aggregate stability compared to ploughing) became less significant. The two-layer plough used in Germany combines the effects of turning and mixing the soil in the upper plough depth, while loosening the soil in the deeper plough layer, resulting in a good soil structure. The differences between the tillage systems in the parameters measured became less when they were releated to the winter rye. This fact {{was due to the}} lack of tillage before the seeding of the crop. In the experiment field of Athens, under minimum and zero tillage, it was found that root and shoot parameters were significantly higher than those of ploughed plots. Physical and chemical soil properties were also improved compared to those of ploughed soil. Yields were found to be significantly correlated to the root parameters and the soil properties, and this was confirmed by the significant yield increase observed under minimum tillage. Concluding the results show that under conditions of temperate humid climate sufficient control of weed and optimized nutrient management in organic farming can only be ensured by turning and mixing the soil. Thus, a general renunciation of ploughing cannot be suggested. Under conditions of primary tillage becomes more important for the main soil properties and more Mediterranean climate and limited soil water availability, reduced profitable in the long term...|$|R
