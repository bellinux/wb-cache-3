40|$|Whole-body fluorine- 18 fluoro- 2 -d-deoxyglucose {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (FDG-PET) is widely used in clinical centres for diagnosis, staging and therapy monitoring in oncology. Images are usually not corrected for attenuation since filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction methods require a 10 to 15 -min transmission scan per bed position on most current PET devices equipped with germanium- 68 <b>rod</b> <b>transmission</b> sources. Such an acquisition protocol would increase the total scanning time beyond acceptable limits. The aim of this work is to validate the use of iterative reconstruction methods, on both transmission and emission scans, {{in order to obtain}} a fully corrected whole-body study within a reasonable scanning time of 60 min. Five minute emission and 3 -min transmission scans are acquired at each of the seven bed positions. The transmission data are reconstructed with OSEM (ordered subsets expectation maximization) and the last iteration is reprojected to obtain consistent attenuation correction factors (ACFs). The emission image is then also reconstructed with OSEM, using the emission scan corrected for normalization, scatter and decay together with the set of consistent ACFs as inputs. The total processing time is about 35 min, which is acceptable in a clinical environment. The image quality, readability and accuracy of uptake quantification were assessed in 38 patients scanned for various malignancies. The sensitivity for tumour detection was the same for the non-attenuation-corrected (NAC-FBP) and the attenuation-corrected (AC-OSEM) images. The AC-OSEM images were less noisy and easier to interpret. The interobserver reproducibility was significantly increased when compared with non-corrected images (96. 1 % vs 81. 1 %, P< 0. 01). Standardized uptake values (SUVs) measured on images reconstructed with OSEM (AC-OSEM) and filtered backprojection (AC-FBP) were similar in all body regions except in the pelvic area, where SUVs were higher on AC-FBP images (mean increase 7. 74 %, P< 0. 01). Our results show that, when statistical reconstruction is applied to both transmission and emission data, high quality quantitative whole-body images are obtained within a reasonable scanning (60 min) and processing time, making it applicable in clinical practice...|$|E

One of the quality determining parameters is the uniformity of the solidification velocity. In order to control the velocity, in situ observation of the solid/liquid interface position is essential. Ultrasonic techniques appear to be suited best because X-ray radiography is problematic in production processes. In this paper a special ultrasonic technique will be discussed and experiments in a solidification process for 24 kg ingots will be reported. The ultrasonic signal is generated and received by the same piezoelectric transducer.

The present study {{is the first in}} which night vision problems are assessed in CSNB patients in a systematic way, with the purpose of improving rehabilitation for these patients. We assessed the night vision problems of 13 CSNB 2 patients and 9 CSNB 1 patients by means of a questionnaire on low luminance situations. We furthermore investigated their dark adapted visual functions by the Goldmann Weekers dark adaptation curve, a dark adapted static visual field, and a two-dimensional version of the "Light Lab". In the latter test, a digital image of a living room with objects was projected on a screen. While increasing the luminance of the image, we asked the patients to report on detection and recognition of objects. The questionnaire showed that the CSNB 2 patients hardly experienced any night vision problems, while all CSNB 1 patients experienced some problems although they generally did not describe them as severe. The three scotopic tests showed minimally to moderately decreased dark adapted visual functions in the CSNB 2 patients, with differences between patients. In contrast, the dark adapted visual functions of the CSNB 1 patients were more severely affected, but showed almost no differences between patients. The results from the " 2 D Light Lab" showed that all CSNB 1 patients were blind at low intensities (equal to starlight), but quickly regained vision at higher intensities (full moonlight). Just above their dark adapted thresholds both CSNB 1 and CSNB 2 patients had normal visual fields. From the results we conclude that night vision problems in CSNB, in contrast to what the name suggests, are not conspicuous and generally not disabling. © 2013 Bijveld et al...|$|R

40|$|Inside {{the second}} {{experimental}} {{wave energy converter}} (WEC) launched at the Lysekil research site on the Swedish west coast in March 2009 a number of sensor systems were installed for measuring the mechanical performance of the WEC and its mechanical subsystems. One of the measurement systems was a set-up of 7 laser triangulation sensors for measuring relative displacement of the piston <b>rod</b> mechanical lead-through <b>transmission</b> in the direct drive. Two measurement periods, separated by 2. 5 month, are presented in this paper. One measurement is made two weeks after launch and another 3 months after launch. Comparisons and correlations are made between different sensors measuring simultaneously. Noise levels are investigated. Filtering is discussed for further refinement of the laser triangulation sensor signals in order to separate noise from actual physical displacement and vibration. Measurements are presented from {{the relative displacement of}} the piston rod mechanical lead-through, from magnetic flux in the air gap, mechanical strain in the WEC structure, translator position and piston rod axial displacement and active AC power. Investigation into the measurements in the time domain with close-ups, in the frequency domain with Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and with time-frequency analysis with short time Fourier transform (STFT) is carried out to map the spectral content in the measurements. End stop impact is clearly visible in the time-frequency analysis. The FFT magnitude spectra are investigated for identifying the cogging bandwidth among other vibrations. Generator cogging, fluctuations in the damping force and in the Lorenz forces in the stator are distinguished and varies depending on translator speed. Vibrations from cogging seem to be present in the early measurement period while not so prominent in the late measurement period. Vibration frequencies due to wear are recognized by comparing with the noise at generator standstill and the vibration sources in the generator.

The sensors {{are capable of}} measuring pressures at high temperatures. In both concepts media separation is realized using a steel membrane. The two concepts represent two different strategies for packaging of devices for use in harsh environments and at high temperatures. The first one is a “one-sensor-one-packaging_technology” concept. The second one uses a standard flip-chip bonding technique. The first sensor is a “floating-concept”, capable of measuring pressures at temperatures up to 400 °C (constant load) with an accuracy of 0. 25 % Full Scale Output (FSO). A push rod (mounted onto the steel membrane) transfers the applied pressure directly to the center-boss membrane of the SOI-chip, which is placed on a ceramic carrier. The chip membrane is realized by Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE or Bosch Process).

40|$|Aims: To characterise {{a strain}} of Gram {{negative}} aerobic straight or slightly curved rods (HKU 3) isolated from the blood culture of a 9 year old Chinese boy with neutropenic fever and pseudobacteraemia. Methods: The isolate was phenotypically investigated by standard biochemical methods using conventional biochemical tests, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Genotypically, the 16 S rRNA gene of the bacterium was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. The sequence of the PCR product was compared with known 16 S rRNA gene sequences in the Genbank by multiple sequence alignment. The G + C content was determined by thermal denaturation. A phylogenetic tree was constructed by the PileUp method. Results: The cells of the bacterial strain were aerobic, sporulating, Gram negative straight or slight curved rods. The bacterium grew on horse blood agar as non-haemolytic, grey colonies of 1 mm in diameter after 24 hours of incubation at 37 °C in ambient air. No enhancement of growth was seen in 5 % CO 2. It grew at 50 °C as pinpoint colonies after 72 hours of incubation, but did not grow at 65 °C or on MacConkey agar. It was non-motile. It produced catalase (weakly positive) and cytochrome oxidase. It reduced nitrate, produced β galactosidase, hydrolysed esculin, and utilised sodium acetate. A scanning electron micrograph of the bacterium showed straight or slightly curved <b>rods.</b> A <b>transmission</b> electron micrograph of the cell wall of the bacterium revealed multiple electron dense layers, including the outer membrane, middle murein layer, and inner cytoplasmic membrane, compatible with its Gram smear appearance. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing showed that there were 7. 7 %, 8. 0 %, 8. 2 %, and 8. 6 % differences between the 16 S rRNA gene sequence of the bacterium and those of Paenibacillus macerans, Paenibacillus borealis, Bacillus ehimensis, and Paenibacillus amylolyticus, respectively. The mean (SD) G + C content of the bacterium was 47. 6 (2. 1) mol%. Phylogenetically, {{it belongs to the}} genus paenibacillus (previously called group 3 bacillus).

40|$|Extracellular signals prompt G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{to adopt}} an active {{conformation}} (R*) and catalyze GDP/GTP exchange in the α-subunit of intracellular G proteins (Gαβγ). Kinetic analysis of transducin (Gtαβγ) activation shows that an intermediary R*·Gtαβγ·GDP complex is formed that precedes GDP release and formation of the nucleotide-free R*·G protein complex. Based on this reaction sequence, we explore the dynamic interface between the proteins during formation of these complexes. We start from the R* conformation stabilized by a Gtα C-terminal peptide (GαCT) obtained from crystal structures of the GPCR opsin. Molecular modeling allows reconstruction of the fully elongated C-terminal α-helix of Gtα (α 5) and shows how α 5 can be docked to the open binding site of R*. Two modes of interaction are found. One of them – termed stable or S-interaction – matches {{the position of the}} GαCT peptide in the crystal structure and reproduces the hydrogen-bonding networks between the C-terminal reverse turn of GαCT and conserved E(D) RY and NPxxY(x) 5, 6 F regions of the GPCR.

Combining measurements not only corroborates the information obtained from any particular method, but also compensates for deficiencies of any single technique. An array of microscopy techniques including high resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy were applied to address scientific and engineering questions concerning the structure and properties of domain patterns in BiFeO 3 ferroelectric thin films and to examine novel TiO 2 (B) thin films suitable for Li-ion battery applications. In BiFeO 3, application of these combined techniques allowed a relationship between epitaxial strain and domain width to be established, two cases of strained films with unique domain structures to be identified, transformation of domain structures from all 109 ° to mixed to all 71 ° based on differing film thicknesses of 100 and 200 nm to be observed, and to identify growth-induced defects that control domain structure over very long range, 100 nm or more, compared to many studies.

40|$|Complete {{photonic}} bandgaps (PBGs) {{are more}} readily achieved in highly-symmetric photonic crystals (Ph Cs). Aperiodic crystals (quasicrystals) with arbitrarily high orientational order are promising candidates {{to lower the}} dielectric contrast necessary to open PBGs. This thesis in- vestigates {{the connection between the}} structural and optical properties of four PhC lattices by studying the effects on transmission and fluorescence spectra. In order of increasing structural isotropy these lattices are: hexagonal, Archimedean-like, Stampfli, and a biomimetic 'sunflower'. High structural isotropy is associated with weaker diffraction. The sunflower's Fourier spectrum is defined by a dense ring of weak reciprocal lattice vectors. Its local morphology, which is everywhere unique, continuously transforms between localised 4 - or 6 -fold symmetry. All other crystals are spatially uniform with pure point spectra. Although structurally similar to the Archimedean, the Starnpfli improves isotropy without sacrificing diffraction efficiency. TM gaps of high-contrast (~c = 8. 61) rod-type PhCs are shown to be nearly independent of the lattice geometry by FDTD simulations. The primary gaps are sensitive to random rod sizes, which disrupts the coherent coupling between the individual <b>rod</b> resonances. <b>Transmission</b> spectra for TE polarisation or hole-type Ph Cs are more dependent on Bragg reflection due to weak or non-existent Mie resonances. In small samples, the TM gap is typically wider in less isotropic crystals. Much larger samples demonstrate the importance of structural isotropy and long-range interactions in low ~c PhCs. The sunflower's 21 % TM gap is, to date, the widest TM PBG reported for ~c = 1. The Stampfli also supports a TE gap in the same range as its 14 % TM gap, thus yielding a 4. 6 % absolute PBG. Further band diagram calculations on an 'approximant' of the sunflower reveal the presence of intrinsic dipolar and monopolar defect states. Microwave characterisation of rod-type samples (~c = 8. 61) showed complete TM PBGs (> 60 dB) with gap ratios ranging from 37. 28 % (hexagonal) to 25. 85 % (sunflower). Low-contrast samples (~c = 1. 6) showed complete TM PBGs (> 30 dB) with gap ratios rising from 10. 37 % (hexagonal) to an ambiguous value of either 10. 48 % or 20. 95 % for the sunflower due to the unusual spiral structuring of the transmission spectra. The Stampfli also supports a complete TE gap (> 10 dB) that coincides with its 14. 19 % TM gap for a 3. 55 % absolute gap that, to the author's knowledge, represents the first conclusive demonstration of an absolute PBG for ~c = 1. 6. A larger sunflower sample was shown to have an extremely large experimental (simulated) TM gap of 33. 33 % (23. 16 %), erroneously broadened by the non-parallel rods. A new approach to enhance the efficiency of up conversion pumping in RE-doped media is pro- posed based on PBG suppression of emission from intermediate levels. Preliminary results indi- cate that visible emission from hexagonal and sunflower PhC slabs in 0. 2 wt% Er:GLSO pumped at 808 nm is enhanced by up to 1. 6 x at 550 nm, or up to 4. 5 x at 525 nm. Subsequent analysis appears to rule out suppression of IR emission, and suggests modified thermal properties as the cause. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
