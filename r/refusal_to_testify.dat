5|$|Andrus {{retired from}} the USAF in 1995, Pilkington in 1996, Emery in 1997, and Santarelli in 1998, {{all at the same}} rank they held {{at the time of the}} shootdown, except Emery, who retired as a brigadier general. Richardson was {{promoted}} to brigadier general on 1 July 1999 and retired on 1 September 2001. Dallager was appointed as superintendent of the USAF Academy in June 2000 and was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 August of the same year. Dallager's appointment and promotion were criticized by observers because of his involvement in the controversial shootdown after-actions and <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> for the senate investigation. Dallager retired on 1 September 2003, but at the rank of major general.|$|E
25|$|Abelhaleem Hasan Abdelraziq Ashqar, {{a member}} of the mosque's Executive Committee, was convicted in November 2007 of {{contempt}} and obstruction of justice for <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> before a grand jury with regard to Hamas, and sentenced to 135 months in prison.|$|E
25|$|In Griffin v. California (1965), the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} a {{prosecutor}} may not ask the jury to draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> in his own defense. The Court overturned as unconstitutional under the federal constitution a provision of the California state constitution that explicitly granted such power to prosecutors.|$|E
50|$|Todd Palin did not honor a September 2008 {{subpoena}} {{to appear}} in court <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> about his role in Troopergate. Two other key witnesses also failed to appear, and all three were originally referred to the full Alaska Senate for contempt. These contempt charges were not addressed until the state legislature met in January 2009, when the legislature had several options including physically bringing the witnesses in, imposing jail time, and levying fines. With the <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> <b>testify,</b> Senator Hollis French, the Democrat chosen to oversee the charges, moved forward with the investigation.Palin's attorney general announced on October 5, 2008, that seven state employees would honor subpoenas <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> in the legislative investigation of the Troopergate affair.|$|R
50|$|Early in his reign, Wenceslaus {{tried to}} pursue a neutral policy with his two {{powerful}} neighbors, the Teutonic Order and Poland; a clear manifestation of this was his <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>testifying</b> during the Teutonic-Polish trial in Inowrocław or the agreement that he signed on 14 April 1321 {{in the city of}} Golub with the Teutonic Knights (represented by Frederick von Wildenberg), by which the Masovian rulers committed to refuse passage to the Lithuanians troops who fight against help the Order. Despite the treaty with the Teutonic Order, initially Wenceslaus managed to maintain good relations with Lithuania, evidenced when in 1323 he allowed Lithuanian troops to cross his territory to invaded the district of Dobrzyń.|$|R
25|$|On January 10, 2011, {{lawyers for}} Bonds filed {{additional}} papers asking the judge not to permit use of Anderson {{as a witness}} by the prosecution (since, given his previous unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>testify,</b> it was presumed he would again decline), nor to allow prosecutors to tell the jury about any <b>refusal</b> of Anderson <b>to</b> <b>testify,</b> nor permit use of a reported tape of Anderson talking to Steve Hoskins, previously a business manager of Bonds.|$|R
25|$|Botha {{refused to}} testify at the new government's Truth and Reconciliation Commission for exposing apartheid-era crimes, which was chaired by his {{cultural}} and political nemesis, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The TRC found that he had ordered {{the bombing of the}} South African Council of Churches headquarters in Johannesburg. In August 1998 he was fined and given a suspended jail sentence for his <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> in relation to human rights violations and the violence sanctioned by the State Security Council (SSC) which he, as president until 1989, had directed.|$|E
25|$|Adamson v. California, – Adamson {{was charged}} with murder but chose not to testify because he knew the {{prosecutor}} would ask him about his prior criminal record. Adamson argued that because the prosecutor had drawn attention to his <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>testify,</b> and thus Adamson's freedom against self-incrimination had been violated. Reed wrote that the rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment did not extend the protections of the Fifth Amendment to state courts. Reed felt that {{the framers of the}} Fourteenth Amendment did not intend to apply the Bill of Rights to states without limitation.|$|E
25|$|On May 7, 2014, Issa {{introduced}} a simple {{resolution in the}} House that passed without objection Recommending that the House of Representatives find Lois G. Lerner, former Director, Exempt Organizations, Internal Revenue Service, in contempt of Congress for refusal {{to comply with a}} subpoena duly issued by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The resolution holds Lois Lerner, one of the central Internal Revenue Service officials involved in the 2013 IRS scandal, in contempt of Congress for her <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> about the scandal before Issa's committee in response to a subpoena.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Taccetta {{ordered a}} murder {{contract}} on the senior Accetturo. When the trial ended in acquittals for the defendants, Accetturo returned to Florida {{for his own}} safety. In September 1989, New Jersey authorities extradited Accetturo from North Carolina due <b>to</b> his <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> appear and <b>testify</b> {{before a grand jury}} about labor racketeering and other state offenses. Due to Taccetta's murder contract, Accetturo was placed in protective custody. In 1993, Taccetta was sent to federal prison.|$|R
60|$|Fourth--Philip Lynch to be {{compelled}} <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> that I {{was killed by}} John B. Winters in self-defence, for the conviction of Winters would bring him in as an accomplice. If that was the programme in John B. Winters' mind nothing saved my life but my persistent <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> sign, when that <b>refusal</b> seemed clearly <b>to</b> {{me to be the}} choice of death.|$|R
50|$|There are broadly two {{categories}} of contempt: being rude or disrespectful to legal authorities in the courtroom, or wilfully failing to obey a court order. Contempt proceedings are especially used to enforce equitable remedies, such as injunctions. In some jurisdictions, the <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> subpoena, <b>to</b> <b>testify,</b> <b>to</b> fulfill the obligations of a juror, or to provide certain information (with the exception of 5th amendment rights and legitimate concerns for personal safety following testimony in the United States) can constitute contempt of the court.|$|R
25|$|The {{judge had}} already {{excluded}} evidence {{which could not}} be connected to Bonds because of Anderson's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> about his alleged knowledge of Bonds' alleged connection to the evidence. The same applies to several other pieces of evidence, which Bonds' attorneys asked to be excluded in the January 10, 2011 filing. A hearing was set to be held on the exclusion of the testimony and the additional evidence on January 21, 2011. A report in the New York Times had earlier suggested it was likely that Bonds would not get prison time even if convicted, after pro cyclist Tammy Thomas received house arrest and probation for similar crimes in the BALCO scandal, in a case decided by the very same judge presiding over the Bonds case.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{prosecution}} and defense reiterated their themes in closing arguments. After showing the jury of eight women and four men photographs of a beaten, bloodied Rasmussen, prosecutor Paul Nunez told them, [...] "It wasn't a fair fight ... This was prey {{caught in a}} cage with a predator." [...] Overland dismissed the entire case as circumstantial [...] "fluff and fill", save for the [...] "compromised" [...] bite-mark DNA sample. He moved for a mistrial after Nunez reminded the jurors that no alibi had been provided for {{the time of the}} murder, since defendants' <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> cannot be held against them, but Perry denied it, saying he did not take that as directly suggesting Lazarus herself had refused to testify and thus her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination had not been violated.|$|E
2500|$|The jury {{took just}} 16 minutes to convict Nodder of Tinsley's abduction. In his summary to the court, Justice Swift paid {{reference}} to Nodder's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> at this trial, stating: [...] "Nobody knows {{what has become}} of that little girl... Whatever happened to her, how she fared, who looked after her, where she slept. There is one person in this court who knows, and he is silent... he is silent! He says nothing to you at all... He sits there and never tells you a word. In passing sentence, Justice Swift added: [...] "What you did with that little girl, what became of her, only you know. It may be that time will reveal the dreadful secret you carry in your breast. I cannot tell, but, I am determined that, as far as have part or lot in that dreadful tragedy, I will keep you in custody." [...] He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, to be served at Lincoln Prison.|$|E
25|$|The {{second trial}} began January 11, 1922, {{with a new}} jury, but with the same legal defense and {{prosecution}} {{as well as the}} same presiding judge. The same evidence was presented, but this time one of the witnesses, Zey Prevon, testified that Brady had forced her to lie. Another witness who testified during the first trial, a former security guard named Jesse Norgard, who worked at Culver Studios where Arbuckle worked, testified that Arbuckle had once shown up at the studio and offered him a cash bribe in exchange for the key to Rappe's dressing room. The comedian supposedly said he wanted it to play a joke on the actress. Norgard said he refused to give him the key. During cross-examination, Norgard's testimony was called into question when he was revealed to be an ex-convict who was currently charged with sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, and who was also looking for a sentence reduction from Brady in exchange for his testimony. Further, in contrast to the first trial, Rappe's history of promiscuity and heavy drinking was detailed. The second trial also discredited some major evidence such as the identification of Arbuckle's fingerprints on the hotel bedroom door: Heinrich took back his earlier testimony from the first trial and testified that the fingerprint evidence was likely faked. The defense was so convinced of an acquittal that Arbuckle was not called <b>to</b> <b>testify.</b> Arbuckle's lawyer, McNab, made no closing argument to the jury. However, some jurors interpreted the <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> let Arbuckle <b>testify</b> as a sign of guilt. After over 40 hours of deliberation, the jury returned February 3, deadlocked with a 10–2 not guilty verdict, resulting in another mistrial.|$|R
50|$|Banev {{said that}} he was invited in writing to a meeting with the Interior Minister, Rumen Petkov, who {{requested}} Brendo’s assistance - i.e. <b>to</b> falsely <b>testify</b> against “the Margin” brothers. According <b>to</b> Banev, his <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> cooperate with the Minister is the main reason behind the 2007 charges for money laundering against him.|$|R
50|$|Nothing in the record, Becker said, {{suggested}} {{to the panel}} {{that there was any}} abuse of discretion by Craighead in her handling of the juror misconduct issue. Nor did Wynn offer any new insight or evidence that would have afforded an opportunity for further review. As for Wynn's desire <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> on his own behalf, his briefs did not elaborate on what he might have said or how his testimony could have changed the outcome. Nor did he suggest that his attorneys' <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> do so constituted either ineffective assistance of counsel or misconduct.|$|R
60|$|When a child, a wife, a servant, a student--any {{one under}} {{personal}} authority or bound by obligation of honor--is accused or suspected an explanation is demanded, and <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> is held, and rightly held, a {{confession of guilt}} To question the accused--rigorously and sharply to examine him on all matters relating to the offense, and even trap him if he seem to be lying--that is Nature's method of criminal procedure; why in our public trials do we forego its advantages? It may annoy; a person arrested for crime must expect annoyance. It can not make an innocent man incriminate himself, not even a witness, but it can make a rogue do so, and therein lies its value. Any pressure short of physical torture or the threat of it, that can be put upon a rogue to make him assist in his own undoing is just and therefore expedient.|$|E

50|$|United States v. Wilson, 610 F.3d 168 (2d Cir. 2010). Vacated the defendant’s death {{sentences}} and remanded {{the case to}} the district court for resentencing. Jacobs held that statements made by the prosecution during the sentencing phase of the trial concerning the defendant’s failure to plead guilty or to take the stand at trial violated the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, and in combination with the district court’s <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> give a Carter no-adverse-inference jury instruction, violated the defendant’s Fifth Amendment right not <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> at trial.|$|R
5000|$|Leweni told Fiji Live on 10-11 February that Korovavala's {{testimony}} {{would no}} longer been needed, {{even though he had}} recently changed his earlier <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> give evidence. Over 60 witnesses had been called. A source reported to be close to Baledrokadroka quoted him as threatening to open [...] "a can of worms" [...] on the Military if forced <b>to</b> <b>testify.</b> Meanwhile, lawyer Devanesh Sharma questioned the validity of the Board of Inquiry, saying that its being chaired by Lieutenant Colonel Samuela Saumatua, a subordinate of Baledrokadroka's, was out of order. Leweni denied this.|$|R
5000|$|The US {{journalist}} Glenn Greenwald {{was asked}} <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> in September, 2014. On August 1, 2014, {{he wrote in}} a letter {{that he was willing to}} support the Parliament's investigation on the espionage in Germany by the NSA. By their <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> let the crucial witness Edward Snowden testify, German politicians had however shown that it is more important to them not to annoy the US than to really investigate and he was not willing to take part in a [...] "ritual" [...] that [...] "shall seem like an investigation".|$|R

50|$|Another case {{involved}} Princess Buniah Al Saud, niece of Fahd of Saudi Arabia, {{who was arrested}} in Orlando, Florida and accused of pushing her Indonesian maid {{down a flight of}} stairs.

The US Department of State has refused <b>to</b> explain their <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> allow a material witness in a criminal case entry to the United States <b>to</b> <b>testify.</b> A civil suit for wages was settled.|$|R

The copies within Lt Col Shaffer's files were destroyed by the DIA in approximately Spring 2004. The destruction of these files is an important element to this story and I encourage the Committee to investigate it further. It would appear, particularly given the Defense Department's outright <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> allow those involved with Able Danger <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> today, that an obstructionist attitude exists. The question for this Committee is to investigate how far that position extends and why." ...|$|R

In his statement to the jury, Lewis noted Czolgosz's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> talk to his lawyers or co-operate with them, admitted his client's guilt, and asserted that [...] "the only question that can be discussed or considered in this case is... whether that act {{was that of a}} sane person.

He {{changed his mind}} again and reluctantly agreed <b>to</b> <b>testify.</b> At the trial, a neighbor backed Birns's alibi. He said he saw Birns arrive home at 12:07 a.m., about the time of the shooting several miles away. It took the jurors four hours to reach a verdict, which resulted in Birns's acquittal. They expressed their <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> believe the changing testimony of Coleman, who had been a dope peddler and police informant.
