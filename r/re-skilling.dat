5000|$|Finally, {{there is}} a human capital {{dimension}} {{to the failure of}} post-Soviet reforms in Russia. The former Soviet population was not necessarily uneducated. Literacy was nearly universal, and the educational level of the Soviet population was {{among the highest in the}} world with respect to science, engineering, and some technical disciplines, although the Soviets devoted little to what would be described as [...] "liberal arts" [...] in the West. With the move to a post-Communist system, the Russian university system collapsed. Rampant credential inflation in the Russian university system made it difficult for employers to determine who was really skilled and the problems of the higher education system more generally made it difficult to remedy other issues of human capital that came from the transition to a market-oriented system, such as upskilling and <b>re-skilling.</b> [...] For example, former state enterprise managers were highly skilled at coping with the demands on them under the Soviet system of planned production targets, but discouraged the risk-and-reward centered behavior of market capitalism. These managers were responsible for a broad array of social welfare functions for their employees, their families, and the population of the towns and regions where they were located. Profitability and efficiency, however, were generally not the most prominent priorities for Soviet enterprise managers. Thus, almost no Soviet employees or managers had firsthand experience with decision-making in the conditions of a market economy.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Durban-Westville, 2001. Our {{present day}} South African {{education}} system lies in great turmoil {{for a variety}} of reasons. The main reason being that there exists a great shortage of skilled educators required to implement Curriculum 2005 and Outcomes Based Education effectively and efficiently. Thus, it is alternate forms of <b>re-skilling</b> via the use of appropriate resources, namely, distance education, the internet, educational television, newspapers and cluster workshops that could bring adequate "re-skilling" to the thousands of teachers who can positively implement a new, revised and streamlined curriculum by June 2001. This study aims to prove that it is these types of on-going teacher-support and the use of educational technology at various levels that will ultimately lead to improving the teaching and learning processes. This study could assist the various stakeholders in the education field to formulate policies that would assist in providing the necessary resources, support and <b>re-skilling</b> necessary for the thousands of unprepared South African teachers who are presently experiencing difficulties in implementing this new education system...|$|E

This shift raises uncomfortable questions about the sustainability of the social contract in all kinds of economies, from advanced to developing.

Qualitative interviews revealed that, while both groups are enthusiastic {{about the future of}} faculty-librarian collaboration on digital scholarship, there remain certain tensions {{about the role of the}} library and the librarian.

40|$|Individuals have a {{wide range}} of goals, aspirations, {{achievements}} and identities, which emerge in a variety of community contexts, institutions, qualification structures and labour markets. Those who do not engage in substantive up-skilling or <b>re-skilling</b> through either formal learning or learning through work, for periods of five to ten years, run the risk of being 'locked into' a particular way of working. They become more vulnerable in the labour market, especially where there is a significant change in their job or their circumstances because their ability to be adaptable with regard to their career progression can decay. Developing career adaptability has a focus on supporting and encouraging individuals to be autonomous, taking responsibility for their own career development. The research considers the potential advantages of career adaptability: for improving public policy in areas such as the quality and effectiveness of career support services.

There are {{problems}} related to the quality in newsrooms adapting multiskilling strategies, but in general multiskilling is more correctly defined as a <b>re-skilling</b> or an up-skilling. This is the conclusion from results of a survey of 1, 500 journalists in Poland, Russia and Sweden, along with interviews with 60 journalists in these three countries. Multiskilling in journalism gives more room for creativity and more power to the individual journalist, according to those with experience of working as multi-reporters.

40|$|PhD) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2006 In this study, {{the factors}} {{influencing}} learner achievement in Geography mapwork were investigated. The survey method was used. Literature review, questionnaires, interviews and observation schedules {{for both the}} educators and learners were used to collect data. The questionnaires and interview questions for both the educators and learners reflected the learners' achievement, school problems and how the learners' performance could be improved. Observation was both participant and non-participant. These observations served two purposes: to establish the teaching strategies/methods used in the classroom, and to establish the classroom interaction between educators and learners and their influence on learner achievement. The investigation involved 208 research participants from schools in the Mafikeng District. The findings reveal that most learners do not perform well in mapwork because they lack motivation in doing mapwork, they Jack basic skills to map reading, and finally, they lack basic mathematical skills. Therefore, there is need for <b>re-skilling</b> and retraining for all those involved in mapwork such as educators and learners {{in areas such as}} basic skills to map reading, basic mathematical skills and the importance of motivation.

More than 80 per cent of Australian workforce growth between 1998 and 2016 {{is projected to}} be in those over 45 years. 1 The Australian Government recognises that mature age labour force participation is important for Australia’s future economic growth prospects. It has subsequently introduced a number of initiatives, including practical measures such as retraining and <b>re-skilling,</b> to boost mature age labour force participation.

The University of Bologna launched an Information Literacy Project in 2003 to improve information skills at all levels. Librarians were involved in a course of “training for trainers” and in the production of Learning Objects/Tutorials for Students and Teachers. This experience was an interesting approach not only to a virtual environment, but also to the basics of pedagogical requirements of a good training course. As a second example of this <b>re-skilling</b> perspective, the experience of a course, delivered in 2008, for hospital librarians as e-tutors on the Moodle platform is also be presented. The critical aspects of this initiative within traditional Italian Universities will be highlighted: the transition to a digital library-oriented profession is made difficult by national and local norms and behaviours. Moreover, technical aspects regarding barriers of access to e-learning content in hospital/university context will be analysed. In this context, it has been a real struggle to develop new professional attitudes based on effective communication skills. ...|$|E
