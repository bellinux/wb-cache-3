40|$|AbstractVibro-acoustic source {{characterization}} is {{an essential}} task in vehicle development to enable prediction of receiver response. For structure-borne noise, the interface forces in multiple degrees of freedom due to internal loads are often quantified for root cause analyses in a single system assembly, as in transfer path analysis (TPA). However, for a reliable prognosis of the acoustic performance of a known component such as a motor or pump, a receiver-independent source characterization is required, and the method of acquiring blocked forces from in-situ measurements {{has been shown to}} be a preferred technique for such purposes. The benefits of the method are the characterization of the intrinsic properties of the source and the possibilities of measuring the component attached to receivers with varying dynamic properties. There is to date a limited number of validation cases where blocked forces from in-situ measurements are acquired for automotive source–receiver assemblies. In this study the blocked forces of a vacuum pump in nine degrees of freedom were determined when connected to a bracket whose boundary conditions were modified in order to achieve four assemblies with different source/receiver dynamic properties. The results show that the blocked forces are transferable, i. e. the receiver response in one assembly was predicted in a wide frequency range by combining source–receiver transfer functions of that assembly with blocked forces estimated in another assembly. Furthermore, an in-situ blocked force TPA was applied to a double-isolated complete vehicle source–receiver case of an electric <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> <b>drive</b> with interior compartment sound pressure as target. The reconstructed magnetic tonal harmonics agreed with the measured target response in the frequency range 50 – 500 Hz, which further motivates the use of the blocked force principles for TPA and source requirements specifications...|$|E
40|$|New {{challenges}} arise for noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) engineers when {{electric motors}} are introduced into cars traditionally powered by internal combustion engines (ICE). The noise signature from an electric traction motor {{is characterized by}} speed-dependent high frequency tonal components due to electro-magnetic excitation. Despite the relatively low overall levels, those tonal components can be prominent and contribute to perceived annoyance for the occupants inside the car. With the rapid increase of various types of hybrid/electric vehicles (EV), new methods are required to secure a desired sound quality in future electric vehicle launches. The objective of this thesis was to explore the audible perception of the electric powertrain and develop and validate experimental methods for assessment of noise transmission. The thesis is based upon seven papers. Four of the papers are oriented around tools and techniques for sound quality assessments of EV-noise. Due to the specific character, there is a proven need for engineers to identify relevant psycho-acoustic metrics for quantifying the subjective perceptions of an accelerating EV. The relationship between the metric prominence ratio (PR) and perceived annoyance was explored and requirement criteria were proposed. PR is appropriate for quantifying individual tonal components, well frequency separated from each other. For more complex sounds, e. g. with multiple proximate prominent tones, the suitability of this metric is questioned. Therefore, the harmonic content {{of a large number}} of EVs on the market was examined in order to bring further facts to the on-going discussion on sound quality quantification of EV specific noise. Furthermore, the assessment environment’s role as well as the impact of experiencing the sound sensation in the real environment for sound quality evaluations were studied. Finally, perception of the tonal components related to different DC/AC conversion techniques including randomized pulse-width modulation was explored. The main mechanical system properties that are responsible for the airborne radiation and transfer of electric powertrain induced noise were studied. The acoustic transfer functions’ (ATF) spatial resolution with respect to estimated interior noise was investigated for theoretically derived and measured surface vibrations. ATFs and surface velocities are also central for the presented in-situ method for determination of radiated sound power from the stator housing due to a dominant order. By acquiring the operational deflection shape due to an electro-magnetic radial force wave, a simplified expression for estimation of the radiation efficiency was derived. The two papers highlight the advantages of the rotational symmetric force excitation acting on the stator housing which enables sound power to be used as an acoustic source characterization, which perhaps is the most adequate measure for system target setting directed towards external suppliers. The final contribution of methods for handling EV-specific noise concerns structure-borne sound. The method of in-situ estimation of blocked forces, a theoretically independent source characterization, is evaluated for transfer path analysis (TPA) of a double isolated electric <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> <b>drive.</b> The method has two main advantages; it is substantially faster compared to the conventional TPA method and the blocked forces allow for accurate prediction of the acoustic response when the same source is being integrated with a different receiving structure. The prerequisite for the second is that the source activity remains invariant and this was further studied. In summary, the work reported in this thesis is intended to support engineers to succeed with the acoustic refinement and thereby also to contribute to increasing competitiveness of hybrid/electric vehicles.

40|$|Complete vehicle, {{system and}} {{component}} target setting for noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) are important activities within automotive product development. New challenges arise when electric motors are introduced into cars traditionally powered by internal combustion engines (ICE). Although the electric powertrain is generally quieter than ICEs, the sound character however {{is completely different}} and necessarily not more preferable. The noise signature from an electric traction motor is characterized by speed-dependent high frequency tonal components from the dominating electro-magnetic harmonics, covering a wide rpm-range. With relatively low levels of broad band masking noise from tires and wind, the tonal components can be accented in a large frequency range and contribute to perceived annoyance for the occupants inside the car. Methods for good practice of NVH development work for traditional vehicles have been established and refined during the last decades. With the rapid increase of various types of electric powertrain-equipped low emission vehicles, new methodology is {{required in order to}} understand and fulfill expectations on these unaccustomed vehicle-acoustic phenomena. The objective with this thesis was to investigate the audible perception of the electric powertrain and develop and validate methods for assessment of noise transmission. The findings aim to support the complete vehicle, system and component target setting processes to secure a desired sound quality in future electric vehicle launches. The thesis is based upon four papers. The first two papers address the human perception of the sound from the electric powertrain during driving. In Paper 1, the evaluation methodology of electric powertrain sound quality was investigated. It was concluded that the mean ratings of a specific acceleration sound stimulus was judged similarly in two laboratory test environments (listening room and “sound car” respectively) as during on-road driving. Further, with lower level of high frequency (> 1 kHz) tonal components, the overall satisfaction and annoyance ratings were improved. The annoyance due to tonal components, stationary as well as speed-dependent, was further studied in Paper 2. The psycho-acoustic metric prominence ratio (PR) was used to quantify the tone levels relative to the adjacent background noise. It was found that for PR-levels below 3 dB, the perceived annoyance was similar independent of frequency range. Increased PR-level provided higher probability of detecting the tones and the perceived annoyance was significantly increased compared to PR< 3 dB for tones above 2. 5 kHz. The findings from Paper 1 and 2 provide foundation for complete vehicle interior acoustic target specification. The following two papers (Paper 3 and 4) focus on the main mechanical system properties that are responsible for the airborne radiation and transfer of electric powertrain induced noise. Paper 3 has emphasis on the experimental determination of acoustic transfer functions (ATFs) between the car’s interior to multiple positions located on the stator shell surface of an electric <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> <b>drive.</b> It addresses the ATFs’ spatial resolution with respect to estimated interior noise for theoretically derived and measured surface vibrations. A reciprocal relation was assumed; therefore the measured ATFs could be used to inversely reproduce the sound transmission from the stator shell to the interior. ATFs and surface velocities are also central in Paper 4, where a method for in-situ determination of radiated sound power from a stator shell was presented and validated. By acquiring the operational deflection shape due to an electro-magnetic radial force wave, a simplified expression for the radiation efficiency was estimated. Paper 3 and 4 highlights the advantages of the rotational symmetric force excitation acting on the stator housing which enables sound power as an acoustic source characterization which perhaps is the most adequate measure for system target setting directed towards external suppliers.
