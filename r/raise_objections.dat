2500|$|On October 20, 2010, the US State Department {{notified}} Congress of {{its intention}} to make the biggest arms sale in American history—an estimated $60.5 billion purchase by Saudi Arabia, trumping the former US-Saudi AWACS sale. The package represents a considerable improvement in the offensive capability of the Saudi armed forces. Israel did not <b>raise</b> <b>objections</b> to the sale, {{except to say that}} it was [...] "not thrilled about it." [...] At the time, a senior administration official stressed: [...] "This is a big development, because it's part of a larger regional strategy and the maintenance of a strong US presence in the region. We're paying attention to the needs of our allies and what everyone in the region believes is a flexing of muscles by a more aggressive Iran. One way to deal with that is to make our allies and friends strong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opposing the King's {{government}} was considered disloyal, even treasonous, {{at the end}} of the 17th century. During the 18th century this idea waned and finally disappeared as the two party system developed. The expression [...] "His Majesty's Opposition" [...] was coined by John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton. In 1826, Broughton, a Whig, announced in the Commons that he opposed the report of a Bill. As a joke, he said, [...] "It was said to be very hard on His Majesty's ministers to <b>raise</b> <b>objections</b> to this proposition. For my part, I think it is much more hard on His Majesty's Opposition to compel them to take this course." [...] The phrase caught on and has been used ever since. Sometimes rendered as the [...] "Loyal Opposition", it acknowledges the legitimate existence of the two party system, and describes an important constitutional concept: opposing the government is not treason; reasonable men can honestly oppose its policies and still be loyal to the Sovereign and the nation.|$|E

2500|$|The process took {{approximately}} 30 {{hours of}} continuous uninterrupted work. The IFE made public the results {{as they were}} being received and tabulated from all 300 of the country's Electoral Councils, one per congressional district. [...] The results were tabulated live; an early lead by López Obrador dwindled slowly until Calderón overtook him {{in the early hours}} of Thursday morning. Unlike the PREP, the Official Count tallied votes in a more organized manner. Information received from the District Councils was added to the running count in the order of the district number, as they arrived to the office. The Councils themselves examined the electoral packages in numerical order. Returns from several northern states which had heavily favored the PAN according to the PREP were in particular slow to arrive; the delay was at least partially attributable to double checking of the tally sheets. Under Mexican Law, any political party could ask for the double-check, and <b>raise</b> <b>objections.</b> The campaign coordinator for Calderón blamed the delay on dilatory tactics by the PRD representatives in those districts.|$|E
