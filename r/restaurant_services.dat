5|$|In 1992, Burger King and its franchises formed <b>Restaurant</b> <b>Services</b> Inc. (RSI), an {{independent}} purchasing cooperative, which covered 100 percent of BK {{stores in the}} United States. The creation of RSI {{was based on a}} proposal by then-CEO Barry Gibbons create an organization that would be autonomous from BK corporate operations, provide full financial disclosure to participants on pricing issues and revenues, and enjoy the participation of the entire chain to maximize the benefits of volume purchasing. The format of RSI was based on the system employed by KFC for its distribution system and was operated in a similar manner. Two weeks after the formation of the co-operative, Grand Met sold the physical assets of BKDS to Canadian-based buyout firm Onex Corporation and folded BKP into RSI.|$|E

25|$|On 27–28 June and 1 July 1960, No. 92220, then {{allocated}} to Cardiff Canton shed, hauled the BR Western Region's flagship Paddington to Cardiff, Swansea, Neyland and Fishguard Harbour passenger express trains, the up Red Dragon and the down Capitals United Express between Cardiff and Paddington, reportedly having to delay its arrival at Paddington {{to allow for}} completion of <b>restaurant</b> <b>services</b> because it was running so early; easily outperforming the regular Britannia passenger express locomotives, which it was observed overtaking (while hauling a full rake of 10+ passenger express coaches) on several occasions. However, its career on these flagship services was cut short, by order of BR senior management, allegedly from fear of damage to its running gear which wasn't designed for extended high speed express work. BR management's embargo, issued after they received word of the runs on 27–28 June, wasn't enforced until after driver Eddie Broom, head of Canton Shed's Local Departmental Committee (the local branch shop steward of ASLEF, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen's extremely powerful trades union), had his turn on 92220's down Capitals United Express run, on 1 July 1960.|$|E

40|$|Restaurant plays a {{key role}} in {{attracting}} tourists and hence contributes significantly to a country’s economy. <b>Restaurant</b> <b>service</b> quality should therefore be well managed and sustained to ensure continuous and increased patronage. In this respect, the determinants and consequences of <b>restaurant</b> <b>service</b> quality need to be well understood. This paper presents the customers’ perception of <b>restaurant</b> <b>service</b> quality for a sample of 342 restaurant customers in Malaysia. The results showed that customers were generally satisfied with the service quality, price and variety of food. Reliability received the highest ratings followed by tangibles and responsiveness. Restaurants serving Western cuisine were rated better than the restaurants serving local food. Customer-perceived <b>restaurant</b> <b>service</b> quality was significantly correlated with the customer satisfaction and loyalty. Age and ethnic background did not affect perception of foodservice quality whereas gender influenced perceptions of food variety and overall satisfaction...|$|R
