The prime aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to examine the}} {{comparative}} mechanical properties of plain and steel-fibre reinforced cement-based materials, and attempt to interpret the behaviour through microstructural considerations. Based on previous studies of steel fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>cements,</b> an examination of the uniaxial, static compressive properties was initially undertaken. These investigations were then extended to the fatigue situation. A knowledge of the properties in compression can be justified {{in view of the fact}} that concrete is extensively designed based on its compressive properties. However, in order to attempt to understand more fully the various factors contributing to steel-fibre reinforcement in cement-based materials, it is considered necessary to carry out tests in direct tension. Another aim was therefore to develop and utilise such a suitable method for comparative purposes under both static and fatigue conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{area and}} {{properties}} of the fiber-matrix interface in fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>cements</b> and concretes determines the amount of stress transferred forth and back between the cement paste and the reinforcement and hence controls the mechanical {{properties of the}} composite. Fiber-fiber interaction and overlap of fibers with fibers, voids and aggregates can dramatically decrease {{the efficiency of the}} reinforcement by reducing this interfacial area. A simple model to account for this reduction is proposed and ways to integrate it in the models describing the mechanical properties of short fiber reinforced concretes are presented. The parameters of the model are evaluated from previously published data sets and its predictions are found to compare well with experimental observations; for example, it is able to predict the non-linear variation of bending and tensile strength with increasing fiber volume fraction as well as the existence of an optimal fiber content.

40|$|Several well {{established}} techniques of soil stabilisation and soil reinforcement {{are available to}} improve properties of geotechnical materials. However, the addition of fibre into soils has its unique potential as a reinforcing agent. This is because a friction between fibre and soil particles increases the bonding between the particles of soils and this can improve the plasticity, stress-strain behaviour and failure characteristics of both cemented and uncemented soils. It also reduces the brittleness of the cemented sand. Numerous experiments on fibre-reinforced granular materials {{have been carried out}} by several researchers. However, the behaviour of fibre-reinforced cemented granular soils has not been fully understood yet. Furthermore, most experimental studies of fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>cemented</b> materials have been carried out at relatively low confining pressures. As a result, more experiments are still needed to understand complicated behaviour of soil-cement-fibre composite materials. The main objective of this thesis is to analyse the behaviour of fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>cemented</b> sand under wide range of confining pressures. For this GDS high pressure triaxial cell apparatus and Bishop and Wesley conventional triaxial cell apparatus have been used to carry out the tests at wide range of confining pressures from 50 kPa to 20 MPa. Drained and undrained tests have been carried out on polypropylene fibre reinforced sand with and without the addition of cement. Samples with varying fibre and cement content were prepared by the method of undercompaction and were cured for 28 days prior to testing. The experimental results indicate that there is a significant effect from the addition of fibre and/or cement contents and confining pressures on the mechanical behaviour of Portaway sand. Particularly, these effects were noted in drained and undrained triaxial tests, particularly peak strength, strength parameters, shear banding, particle crushing, yielding, and stress-dilatancy relationships. The addition of fibres increases the peak, yield, and ultimate strengths. Increase in confining pressure also increases the strength but the individual effect of the addition of fibres was more pronounced at low confining pressures. Progressive suppression in the dilation by the gradual increase in confining pressures as well as an increase in dilation with the addition of fibres during triaxial compression was also worth noticeable. Although, no noticeable affect was observed in isotropic compression due to the addition of fibre in both cemented and uncemented sand. An extensive series of tests were carried out but due to time constraint only one type and length of fibre was used. Therefore, more research needs to be carried out at different fibre lengths and types in order to see that whether these change the behaviour observed in this research.
