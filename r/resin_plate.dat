40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of this work was to use a novel 3 -D test analysis system for evaluating the mechanical properties of the natural fiber fabric composites under biaxial loads. Composites with three resin matrices (water-based epoxy resin, isocyanate resin, phenolic resin) were investigated, and strain-filed were characterized by using the digital speckle correlation. The water-based epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>plate</b> and isocyanate <b>resin</b> <b>plate</b> demonstrated a characteristic of orthotropy and elastoplasticity, while the phenolic resin board revealed linear elastic and brittle-fracture simultaneously at X,Y-axial. Dissimilarities of biaxial load value {{were related to the}} orthotropy of composite structure, and load changes in fracture direction had a negative effect on the other directions at breaking moment. The degrees of dropping presented a positive correlation with the load values at rift direction. Under the linear elastic stage, the value of load and average strain at Y-direction were larger than that under X-direction within the same testing area. The strain-filed at X/Y-direction provided by isocyanate and phenolic resin plates illustrated a more smooth change than that of the water-based epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|E

The polymerization of acrylic resin can be performed by conventional method and microwave, both produce different residual monomer at different toxicity.

Sodium Hypochlorite as removable denture disinfectant can be expected to be biocompatible to human body. The problem is how biocompatible acrylic resin which has been processed by conventional method and microwave method after being soaked in sodium hypochlorite solution. Purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} understand in vitro biocompatibility of acrylic resin which has polimerated by conventional method and microwave after being soaked in sodium hypochlorite using tissue culture. Methods: Four groups of acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>plate</b> were produced, the first group was acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>plate</b> with microwave polymeration and soaked in sodium hypochlorite, the second group was acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>plate</b> with microwave polymeration but not soaked, the thirdwas one with conventional method and soaked and the last group was one with conventional method but not soaked, and in 1 control group.

A disadvantage of acrylic resin {{is that it is}} easily to be cracked. One of the ways to resolve this problem is by adding the E-glass fibers. The purpose of this research was to find out the effect of volumetric E-glass fiber on transverse strength of an acrylic resin denture plate repair. The experiment involved thirty plates of heat cured acrylic with the dimensions of 65 × 10 × 2. 5 mm. The specimens were prepared to create a 3 -mm gap and 45 ° bevel. Subjects were divided in to 3 groups, each of which contained 10. Group I (control) was with no fiber reinforcement, group II was reinforced with 3. 7 vol % E-glass fiber, and group III was reinforced with 7. 4 volume % E-glass fiber. All plates were soaked in distillation water for one day at 37 °C. Plates were tested for transverse strength with Universal Testing Machine and all data obtained was analyzed with one way anova at 95 % confidence level (α= 0. 05).

Fifteen <b>plates</b> of 10 x 10 x 2 mm were made from chemical, heat, and microwave activated acrylic <b>resin.</b> The <b>plates</b> were incubated in saliva for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours. Pellicle characterization was done every hour by SDS PAGE electrophoresis. The result showed that: 1. chemical, heat, and microwave activated acrylic resin adsorbed salivary pellicle by molecular weight of 50 - 61 kDa (amylase band); 2. incubation of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours in saliva resulted in similar pellicle composition. In conclusion, adsorbed salivary pellicle on acrylic resin surface during 5 hours showed similar characteristic in every hour, with the major protein adsorbed: amylase...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to study free convection cooling of electronic components on a PWB placed horizontally within the cabinet. The cabinets (200 mm× 150 mm in cross-section 80 mm high), which were made from acrylic <b>resins</b> <b>plates</b> (4 mm thick), had the ventilating many small holes in the front panel and the bottom panel. The ratio of the ventilating hole area in the front panel to the front panel inside area was altered by changing the diameter of each hole. The effects of the ventilation on the hottest temperature in the PWB are cleared quantitatively by using this ventilating area ratio. The flow pattern in the cabinets was visualised by using the tobacco smoke and the laser beam. It seemed {{that there was a}} close connection between the flow pattern and the location of the hot spot on the PWB, and that the ventilating holes in the bottom was not useful for cooling the PWB...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of free convection cooling of electronic components on PWB, which was placed horizontally in the cabinets, was carried out using the following two types of model cabinet. (1) The cabinets (200 × 150 mm in cross section, 80 mm high), which were made of acrylic <b>resins</b> <b>plates</b> (4 mm thick), had the ventilating small holes in the top panel and the bottom panel of them. (2) The two-dimensional models of the cabinet (160 × 380 m in cross section and 80 m high) had many slits in the top panel of them. Numerical values of velocity of the ventilation, which were estimated by the heat balance analysis using the measured temperature, agreed with the values directly measured by LDV. It was demonstrated that the flow rate of ventilation could be estimated using the obtained relation between the ventilating air velocity and the mean temperature excess on the inner wall surface of the cabinets...|$|R
