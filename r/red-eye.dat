5|$|Yet another DC-10, {{performing}} Western Airlines Flight 2605, {{crashed in}} Mexico City after a <b>red-eye</b> flight from Los Angeles barely 5 {{months after the}} crash of American Airlines flight 191. The Western Airlines DC-10's crash, however, was due to low visibility and an attempt to land on a closed runway. Ironically, the crash of yet another DC-10, United Airlines Flight 232, ten years later, restored some of the aircraft's reputation. Despite losing an engine and all flight controls and crash-landing in a huge fireball (which was caught on video by a local news crew), 185 people survived the accident. Experts praised the DC-10's sturdy construction as {{partly responsible for the}} high number of survivors, though the efforts of the crew were primarily responsible.|$|E

25|$|In a {{photograph}} of a child's face, if there is <b>red-eye</b> in one eye but not the other, it may be leukocoria, which may be caused by the cancer retinoblastoma. The child's eyes should be examined by a general physician.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} <b>red-eyes</b> removal pipeline uses {{three main}} steps {{to identify and}} remove <b>red-eyes</b> artifacts. First, candidates <b>red-eyes</b> patches are extracted, then they are they are classified to distinguish between eyes and non-eyes patches. Finally, correction is performed on detected red eyes. The details of the three steps involved in the proposed pipeline are detailed in the following subsections.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, an {{advanced}} pipeline for <b>red-eyes</b> detection and correction is discussed. In the first stage, candidates rede-yes patches are {{extracted from the}} input image through an image filtering pipeline. This process is mainly based on a statistical color model technique coupled with geometrical constraints. In the second stage, a multimodal classifier, obtained by using clustering and boosting on gray codes features, is used to distinguish between true <b>red-eyes</b> patches versus other patches. Once the red eyes are detected, a correction technique based on desaturation and brightness reduction is employed to remove the <b>red-eyes</b> artifact. The proposed approach has been compared with respect to existing solutions on proper collected dataset, obtaining competitive results. One of the main contributions of the present work is to demonstrate that better results are achieved if the multimodally nature of candidates <b>red-eyes</b> {{as well as the}} spatial information during classification task are taken into account. To this aim, we have compared the proposed cluster-based boosting, to standard boosting in both cases, with and without considering spatial information.|$|R

25|$|Theatrical followspot operators, {{positioned}} nearly coincidentally with a {{very bright}} light and somewhat distant from the actors, occasionally witness <b>red-eye</b> in actors on stage. The effect is not visible {{to the rest of}} the audience because it is reliant on the very small angle between the followspot operator and the light.|$|E
25|$|Professional photographers {{prefer to}} use ambient light or {{indirect}} flash, as the <b>red-eye</b> reduction system does not always prevent red eyes— for example, if people look away during the pre-flash. In addition, people do not look natural with small pupils, and direct lighting from close to the camera lens is considered to produce unflattering photographs.|$|E
25|$|It was at {{this time}} the airport began to {{experience}} the full effects of the jet age. Although both Air India and Qantas commenced operating Boeing 707s {{in the mid to}} late 1950s from Perth to Singapore and the sub continent the aircraft of the day grew faster and more demanding due to their sophistication, facilities at the airport continued to improve to accommodate them. By the mid-1960s the airport commenced seeing its first domestic pure jet engine aircraft, commencing with a Boeing 727 in 1964, and the Douglas DC-9 in 1967, both types operated by TAA and Ansett ANA. It {{was at this}} time that the airport {{was one of the few}} major airports in the country which operated without curfews, and due to the increased number and frequency of flights operating from the airport it gave birth to what was then referred to as the midnight horror or <b>red-eye</b> special, known in more recent history as the <b>red-eye</b> flight.|$|E
30|$|A {{two-stage}} algorithm {{was described}} by Zhang [9]. At the first stage, red pixels are grouped, and a cascade of heuristic algorithms to deal with color, size, and highlight is used {{to decide whether the}} grouped region is red eye or not. At the second stage, candidate <b>red-eyes</b> regions are checked by using Adaboost classifier. Though highlight is useful for <b>red-eyes</b> detection, some red eye with no highlight region may occur when the eye direction does not face toward the camera/flash light. Artifacts are corrected through brightness and contrast adjustment followed by blending operation.|$|R

For each point of the grid, the correct detection and false positives rates of the true <b>red-eyes</b> pixels within the dataset were obtained.

25|$|On July 13, 2015, American {{announced}} that it planned to discontinue the US Airways brand name on October 17, 2015. On that date, US Airways made its final flight: Flight 1939 (for the year the airline was founded), using an Airbus A321 registered N152UW, and would take off as US Airways Flight 1939 and land as American Airlines Flight 1939. The flight originated from Philadelphia International Airport, at 10:05 AM, October 16, 2015 continuing to Charlotte Douglas International Airport, then to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, and then to San Francisco International Airport. The aircraft made its final leg {{on the evening of}} October 16, as a <b>red-eye</b> flight from San Francisco International Airport back to Philadelphia International Airport. It landed ahead of schedule at 5:52AM EDT, and at that point, the US Airways brand and all operations under its name were officially terminated.|$|E

500|$|Afterwards, McAdams starred {{opposite}} Cillian Murphy in Wes Craven's psychological thriller Red Eye, {{where she}} played a young hotel manager who is held captive by Murphy's character while aboard a <b>red-eye</b> flight. Craven has said McAdams was the only actress he considered for the part. She {{was drawn to the}} relatable qualities of her character: [...] "She was not some sweaty, tank-top-wearing, Uzi-carrying super woman". Robert Koehler of Variety found her [...] "increasingly impressive" [...] while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times asserted that [...] "she brings more presence and credibility to her role than is really expected; she acts without betraying the slightest awareness that she's inside a genre. Her performance qualifies her for heavy-duty roles." [...] Upon release, the film, which was made on a budget of $26 million, earned over $95 million at the worldwide box office.|$|E

[...] We promise to return him in one piece." [...] The younger Weinberg began playing during segments of the tour's shows, and got a very positive response from audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band.

60|$|And in such fashion were we saved. It {{was a mere}} accident--the sheerest accident.

500|$|Jay Weinberg {{appeared}} {{at a number}} of shows on the first, North American leg, drumming on anywhere from four songs to half the show. [...] He had been a fan of heavy metal music for much of his life, and in playing with Springsteen he integrated a polyrhythmic approach influenced by metal bands such as Lamb of God, Mastodon, and Slipknot with the E Street drumming style derived from big bands and early rock and roll. [...] He received a very positive reaction from both audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band, with his vigorous, long-hair-flying style inviting comparisons to Dave Grohl and his potential for replacing his father drawing allusions to Wally Pipp. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote, [...] "All hail Jay Weinberg. ... With [...] the band’s chemistry was slightly unsettled for the better. ... His fills during 'Radio Nowhere' kicked the song, and the concert, into a higher gear, and galvanized a band that was starting to pace itself." [...] Jay Weinberg said [...] "it's a summer job that anybody would want," [...] while Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able {{to go out in the}} audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] Jay Weinberg played his first full show on May 14 at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York, as Max Weinberg was in California to prepare test runs for The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien start. [...] Springsteen said of the occasion, “This is the first night in 35 years that somebody else sat at the drums.” Overall, Modern Drummer magazine's editor said that a college freshman playing on one of the year's biggest rock tours was [...] "certainly a unique story". [...] For the final Meadowlands Arena shows of the first leg, Jay Weinberg did the first but his father took a <b>red-eye</b> flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Red-eye</b> {{effect is}} seen in {{photographs}} of children also because children's eyes have more rapid dark adaption: [...] in low light a child's pupils enlarge sooner, and an enlarged pupil accentuates the <b>red-eye</b> effect.|$|E
2500|$|In many flash photographs, {{even those}} without {{perceptible}} <b>red-eye</b> effect, the tapetum lucidum of many animals' pupils creates an [...] "eyeshine" [...] effect.

3000|$|The {{technique}} {{proposed by}} Volken et al. [13] detects the eye itself by finding the suitable colors and shapes. They use the basic knowledge that an eye {{is characterized by}} its shape and the white color of the sclera. Combining this intuitive approach with the detection of [...] "skin" [...] around the eyes, <b>red-eyes</b> artifacts are detected. Correction is made through an adhoc filtering process.|$|R
60|$|As it was, {{we were in}} {{no small}} danger. Zip! A tiny pebble whirred past with the force almost of a bullet. Lop-Ear and I began {{paddling}} frantically. Whiz-zip-bang!

2500|$|<b>Red-eye</b> removal {{is built}} into many popular {{consumer}} graphics editing software packages, or is supported through <b>red-eye</b> reduction plug-ins; examples include Adobe Photoshop, Apple iPhoto, Corel Photo-Paint, GIMP, Google Picasa, Paint.NET and Microsoft Windows Photo Gallery. [...] Some can automatically find eyes in the image and perform color correction, and can apply it to many photos at once. Others may require the operator to manually select the regions of the pupils to which correction is to be applied. [...] When performed manually, correction may consist of simply converting the red area of pupils to grayscale (desaturating), leaving surface reflections and highlights intact.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>red-eye</b> {{effect in}} {{photography}} {{is the common}} appearance of red pupils in color photographs of the eyes of humans and several other animals.

60|$|There yet {{remain to}} {{us a few}} minutes before we climb to our caves. We are tired from the play of the day, and the sounds we make are subdued. Even the cubs, still greedy for fun and antics, play with restraint. The wind from the sea has died down, and the shadows are {{lengthening}} with the last of the sun's descent. And then, suddenly, from <b>Red-Eye's</b> cave, breaks a wild screaming and the sound of blows. He is beating his wife.|$|R
30|$|Petschnigg et al. [11] {{presented}} a <b>red-eyes</b> detection technique based on changes of pupil color between the ambient {{image and the}} flash image. The technique exploits two successive photos taken with and without flash considered into YCbCr space to decorrelate luminance from chrominance. The artifacts are detected by thresholding the differences of the chrominance channels and using geometric constraints to check {{size and shape of}} red regions. Detected red eyes are finally corrected through thresholding operation and the color replacement pipeline proposed in [4].|$|R
60|$|We, to whom most happenings were jokes, never laughed during <b>Red-Eye's</b> wife-beatings. We {{knew too}} well {{the tragedy of}} them. On more than one morning, {{at the base of}} the cliff, did we find the body of his latest wife. He had tossed her there, after she had died, from his cave-mouth. He never buried his dead. The task of {{carrying}} away the bodies, that else would have polluted our abiding-place, he left to the horde. We usually flung them into the river below the last drinking-place.|$|R
