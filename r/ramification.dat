5|$|The {{widespread}} Yellow Turban Rebellion {{also occurred}} in 184 CE, its leaders {{claiming that they}} were destined {{to bring about a}} utopian era of peace. Like the Five Pecks of Rice society, the Yellow Turbans of the Huai and Yellow River valleys also believed that illness was a sign of wrongdoing that necessitated confession to church leaders and faith healers. However, the Yellow Turbans typically utilized holy water as a <b>ramification</b> for sickness; if this did not cure the sick, the latter's sins were deemed too great to be exculpated. Since the year 184 CE was the first (and very auspicious) year of a new sexagenary cycle, the Yellow Turban's supreme leader Zhang Jue (d. 184 CE) chose the third month of that year as the time to rebel; when this was leaked to the Han court, Zhang was forced to initiate the rebellion prematurely. Although the Yellow Turbans were able to muster hundreds of thousands of troops, they were overpowered by the combined force of imperial troops and independent generals. By {{the end of the year}} their leadership—including Zhang Jue—had been killed and only scattered groups remained until they were amalgamated into the forces of Cao Cao in 192 CE.|$|E

25|$|In {{algebraic}} number theory, the rings of algebraic integers are Dedekind rings, which constitute therefore an important class of commutative rings.

The restriction of algebraic field extensions to subrings has led to the notions of integral extensions and integrally closed domains as well as the notion of <b>ramification</b> of an extension of valuation rings.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} discriminant {{regulates the}} <b>ramification</b> {{data of the}} field extension K/L. A prime ideal p of L ramifies in K if, and only if, it divides the relative discriminant ΔK/L. An extension is unramified if, and only if, the discriminant is the unit ideal. The Minkowski bound above shows {{that there are no}} non-trivial unramified extensions of Q. Fields larger than Q may have unramified extensions: for example, for any field with class number greater than one, its Hilbert class field is a non-trivial unramified extension.|$|E

In 1994, it entered the Guinness book as the tree which covers the largest area, 8,400 square meters; larger than a typical {{football}} pitch.

There is even a gazebo located in the cashew, a popular attraction among tourists.|$|E

The church's law of chastity forbids homosexual sex in all contexts. Consistently breaking the law of chastity may result in excommunication. Nevertheless, Latter-day Saints who identify themselves as gay or lesbian may remain in good standing in the church, without <b>ramification,</b> if they abstain from homosexual relations.|$|E
25|$|By the 1850s, feral cats {{inhabited}} the Western Australian wheatbelt; they targeted {{a number of}} larger rodents throughout Western Australia. However, extinction occurred before the red fox came to Western Australia (Burbidge, 618). The big-eared hopping mouse had no defenses against Australia's introduced species. Its extinction can possibly be shown as a <b>ramification</b> of environmental alteration by humans, and predation is another likely possibility, but the true reason for the extinction is uncertain.

50|$|The living animal has {{a general}} orange color. The whole dorsum has brown dots except the tips or {{apex of the}} lateral {{appendage}}s, which are pale yellow. The dorsum has a white diamond shaped spot that runs from the behind of the rhinophores to the tail (just behind the branchial leaves). The end of the foot is acute and has a similar color to the appendage apices. Two types of appendages are observed. The first type of appendages are longer and wider and are positioned at {{the margin of the}} sides of the animal. These appendages have apical <b>ramifications</b> that are rounded at the base with a long, thin and sharp prolongation. Small acute <b>ramifications</b> cover the remaining parts of the appendage. The second type of appendage is thin, long with many small sharp, thin and long simple <b>ramifications.</b> These appendages are present on the entire body, sides, foot, and dorsum. The oral veil has four appendages, two of which are longer, situated at the lateral edges of the oral veil and two that are shorter situated in the center. The rhinophores have a lamellate clavus and a peduncule with acute <b>ramifications.</b> Each rhinophoral sheath edge has three <b>ramifications.</b> The middle one is virtually identical to the lateral appendages. The other two <b>ramifications</b> are similar to the smaller tentacles {{of the rest of the}} body. The oral tentacles are simple folds of the mantle with the appearance of cylinders. The three branchial leaves are tripinnate. They have the same simple and thin <b>ramifications</b> as the smaller appendages.|$|R

25|$|Peirce's {{theory of}} signs {{is known to}} be one of the most complex {{semiotic}} theories due to its generalistic claim. Anything is a sign — not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The sign relation is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its object, and (3) the sign's meaning or <b>ramification</b> as formed into a kind of effect called its interpretant (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible triadic relation, according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants.|$|E
25|$|The {{small size}} of the tree and some dwarfing of foliage result from pruning the trunk, branches, and roots. Pruning is often {{the first step in}} {{transforming}} a collected plant specimen into a candidate for bonsai. The top part of the trunk may be removed to make the tree more compact. Major and minor branches that conflict with the designer's plan will be removed completely, and others may be shortened to fit within the planned design. Pruning later in the bonsai's life is generally less severe, and may be done for purposes like increasing branch <b>ramification</b> or encouraging growth of non-pruned branches. Although pruning is an important and common bonsai practice, it must be done with care, as improper pruning can weaken or kill trees. Careful pruning throughout the tree's life is necessary, however, to maintain a bonsai's basic design, which can otherwise disappear behind the uncontrolled natural growth of branches and leaves.|$|E
25|$|On 8 May 2013, the Court of Appeals in Milan {{confirmed}} the four-year prison sentence, and extended the public office ban to five years. On 1 August 2013, the Court of Cassation (final appeal) {{confirmed the}} sentence of 4 years, {{of which the}} last three years are automatically pardoned. The decision marked the first time that Berlusconi received a definitive sentence, despite being on trial nearly 30 times during the last 25 years. In regards of calculating the exact length of the public office ban, the Court of Cassation asked the lower court to re-judge this, because of prosecutors having presented new legal arguments for the ban to be reduced from five to three years. However, a new anti-corruption law passed in late 2012, referred to as the , will bar Berlusconi from seeking elective office for six years, independently of the court's final ruling regarding the length of the public office. The <b>ramification</b> of his public office ban is that it makes him ineligible to serve any public office, but technically he will still be allowed as a non-candidate to continue leading his party and centre-right coalition in election campaigns. A similar situation occurred in March 2013, when the leader of the Five Star Movement, Beppe Grillo, convicted over a road accident in 1988, led his party's 2013 election campaign despite not being able to run for public office because of a rule established within his movement.|$|E
