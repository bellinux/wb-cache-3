5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for <b>rainwear,</b> protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, a DuPont {{research}} {{manager in}} the Teflon business, Bill Gore, left the company because of its unwillingness to develop Teflon as wire-coating insulation. Gore's son Robert found a method for solving the wire-coating problem and the company W. L. Gore and Associates was born. In 1969, Robert Gore developed an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane {{which led to the}} large Gore-Tex business in breathable <b>rainwear.</b> The company developed many other uses of PTFE.|$|E
25|$|The {{flexibility}} of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for {{various kinds of}} shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful {{in the manufacture of}} articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in <b>rainwear,</b> diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as a lining for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps. Indian rubber balls or lacrosse balls are made of rubber.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{vulcanization}} is {{a nineteenth-century}} invention, {{the history of}} rubber cured by other means goes back to prehistoric times. The name of the first major civilization in Guatemala and Mexico, the [...] "Olmec", means [...] "rubber people" [...] in the Aztec language. Ancient Mesoamericans, spanning from ancient Olmecs to Aztecs, extracted latex from Castilla elastica, a type of rubber tree in the area. The juice of a local vine, Ipomoea alba, was then mixed with this latex to create processed rubber as early as 1600 BC. In the Western world, rubber remained a curiosity, although {{it was used to}} produce waterproofed products, such as Mackintosh <b>rainwear.</b>|$|E

50|$|Linseed oil is {{extracted}} from {{the seeds of the}} flax plant, already extensively grown for the production of linen. The raw oil may be used, but it cures poorly and leaves a sticky surface. Normally boiled linseed oil is used. This has been prepared beforehand by boiling with lead, in the form of lead oxide, or with manganese salts. Modern boiled oils use a lead-free metallic drier added cold, such as cobalt resinate. Old linseed oil finishes yellow with age, owing to oxidation with the air. Linseed oil was also widely used for the production of oilcloth, a waterproof covering and <b>rainwear</b> material, formed by coating linen or cotton fabrics with the boiled oil.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, a Scot named Edward Le Roy emigrated to New Zealand. He {{was able to}} {{manufacture}} oilskin <b>rainwear</b> for use by sailors on sailing ships in the local waters at the time. The garments were originally constructed from the lightweight sails of the sailing ships. The waterproofing of the clothing was by application of linseed oil to the cotton. T. E. Pearson, the son of E. J. Pearson who started Pearson Soap in Hamilton, New Zealand, took a consignment of Leroy Coats to Australia. Stockmen at the time had gathered news of this garment from sailors who had subsequently left sailing {{to work on the}} land. Because the garments were flammable around campfires, T. E. Pearson worked on developing a new formula for sealing the coats. He did this in the backyard shed of his home in Kangaroo Street, Manly. Pearson subsequently, in partnership with Leroy, registered the trademark. T.E. died in 1964 and is buried in Frenchs Forest, New South Wales.|$|E
5000|$|More than 2 {{million tons}} of DEHP are {{produced}} worldwide each year. [...] Products that contain DEHP include tablecloths, floor tiles, shower curtains, garden hoses, <b>rainwear,</b> dolls, toys, shoes, medical tubing, furniture upholstery, and swimming pool liners. DEHP is an indoor air pollutant in homes and schools. Common exposures come {{from the use of}} DEHP as a fragrance carrier in cosmetics, personal care products, laundry detergents, colognes, scented candles, and air fresheners.The most common exposure to DEHP comes through food with an average consumption of 0.25 milligrams per day. It can also leach into a liquid that comes in contact with the plastic; it extracts faster into nonpolar solvents (e.g. oils and fats in foods packed in PVC). Fatty foods that are packaged in plastics that contain DEHP {{are more likely to have}} higher concentrations such as milk products, fish or seafood, and oils. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) therefore permits use of DEHP-containing packaging only for foods that primarily contain water.|$|E

Aperture design is very {{important}} in the design process of <b>rainwear,</b> as garment aperture {{is one of the main}} pathways for air exchange between clothing microclimate and the environment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of aperture design on whole and local ventilations of <b>rainwear.</b> Ventilation was measured by a tester developed based on the steady-state method. A <b>rainwear</b> suit with top and bottom was chosen as the basic ensemble. Apertures were added at the arm, chest, back and knee separately. Local ventilation of the arm, chest, back and whole ventilation of the top and bottom in different walking and wind conditions were measured. Local and whole ventilations at five aperture conditions for the top and four for the bottom were studied. The results indicated that local ventilation value of the chest was the biggest and the arm was the smallest. Whole ventilation of the suit was the biggest when walking at 5. 6 km/h, with all the designed apertures opened. Local ventilation value was bigger when opening arm aperture than that of opening chest or back aperture. The bottom ventilation was the highest when both front and back apertures were opened...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to work with CUP Co., Ltd. to develop <b>rainwear</b> for {{wheelchair}} users which caregivers would find easy to help people to put on and feel comfortable. We produced prototypes with cloth which had two kinds of water vapor permeability: 3. 71 g/m 2 ・h and 1. 52 g/m 2 ・h. Impaired persons (N= 24) used these in their daily lives, and they evaluated the clothing for size, waterproofness, the ease with which assistants could put the clothing on and remove, together with its comfort and safety while the wheelchair was moving. In addition, concerning moisture permeability, the five subjects measured the clothing in weather of 30 ± 1 ℃ and 65 ± 5 % humidity. As a result, (1) The design proved easy for caregivers to put on and take off, and the size fitted persons between 150 and 170 cm tall, (2) Comfort, waterproofness, and safety were rated very highly, and (3) The temperature in the clothes was slightly high at 34. 7 ℃, but the humidity stayed at around 60 %, and neither kind of material perspired. Thus, as <b>rainwear</b> for wheelchair users, it was found that intermediate water vapor permeability was comfortable enough for wheelchair users’ daily lives...|$|E
