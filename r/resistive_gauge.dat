40|$|The broad {{variety of}} ways in which {{magnetic}} helicity affects astrophysical systems, in particular dynamos, is discussed. The so-called alpha effect is responsible for the growth of large-scale magnetic fields. The conservation of magnetic helicity, however, quenches the alpha effect, in particular for high magnetic Reynolds numbers. Predictions from mean-field theories state particular power law behavior of the saturation strength of the mean fields, which we confirm in direct numerical simulations. The loss of magnetic helicity in the form of fluxes can alleviate the quenching effect, which means that large-scale dynamo action is regained. Physically speaking, galactic winds or coronal mass ejections can have fundamental effects on the amplification of galactic and solar magnetic fields. The gauge dependence of magnetic helicity is shown to play no effect in the steady state where the fluxes are represented in form of gauge-independent quantities. This we demonstrate in the Weyl-, resistive- and pseudo Lorentz-gauge. Magnetic helicity transport, however, is strongly affected by the gauge choice. For instance the advecto-resistive gauge is more efficient in transporting magnetic helicity into small scales, which results in a distinct spectrum compared to the <b>resistive</b> <b>gauge.</b> The topological interpretation of helicity as linking of field lines is tested with respect to the realizability condition, which imposes a lower bound for the spectral magnetic energy in presence of magnetic helicity. It turns out that the actual linking does not affect the relaxation process, unlike the magnetic helicity content. Since magnetic helicity is not the only topological variable, I conduct a search for possible others, in particular for non-helical structures. From this search I conclude that helicity is {{most of the time the}} dominant restriction in field line relaxation. Nevertheless, not all numerical relaxation experiments can be described by the conservation of magnetic helicity alone, which allows for speculations about possible higher order topological invariants.

40|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of {{reversible}} elastic lattice strain on the electronic properties of a) (Pr 1 −y Lay) 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 (PLCMO) thin films and b) the interface layer of La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 (LSMO) with SrTiO 3 (STO) has been determined using piezoelectric substrates. Lattice strain is known to effectively alter the electronic structure of compounds from the manganite family, since it shifts the balance of competing electronic interactions by changing bond angles and bond lengths. The PLCMO films have been repared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) from a La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 (LCMO) and a Pr 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 (PCMO) target. The metal- insulator phase boundary has been established to lie around y = 0. 6. In films with y = 0. 6, the piezoelectric release of tensile strain in the film plane induces a drastic reduction of the resistance, or a “colossal” elastoresistance. <b>Resistive</b> <b>gauge</b> factors as high as Γ = 1000 have been found. Consistent with the transport results, the release of tensile strain leads {{to an increase in}} both the Curie temperature and the magnetisation. The coexistence of the ferromagnetic metallic (FMM) and charge ordered insulating (COI) phases in PLCMO {{has been found to be}} strongly affected by the reversible substrate strain. Both the magnetisation and the resistance data in controlled strain states demonstrate a strong suppression of the ferromagnetic double exchange interaction by tensile strain. [La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO/SrTiO 3] superlattices have been deposited on STO and piezoelectric PMN-PT (001) (PbMg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3 O 3) 0. 72 (PbTiO 3) 0. 28 substrates by PLD. X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements show clear Kiessig fringes as well as the larger interference maxima caused by the superlattice, giving qualitative proof of a well defined superlattice structure with sharp interfaces on both substrates. With decreasing LSMO layer thickness d, the samples show a sharp decrease of the Curie temperature, accompanied by a decrease of the saturation magnetisation and an increase of the coercive field around d = 5 nm. Reversible strain measurements on thicker superlattices (d = 16. 7 nm) reveal a behaviour of the magnetisation similar to that of single thick films of LSMO. When d is decreased, the strain induced relative change in magnetisation ∆M/M 0 shows a behaviour comparable to PLCMO thin films. This has been attributed to the increased volume fraction of the LSMO inter- face layer with STO, which displays a reduced magnetic order and phase-separated tendencies. From the absolute change in magnetisation per interface, the thickness of the so-called magnetically “dead” layer of the LSMO has been estimated to lie between 1. 3 nm and 1. 7 nm in the superlattices grown on PMN-PT...|$|E

40|$|Over the 1980 ’s, the {{introduction}} of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies has provided alternative methods for the fabrication of complex three-dimensional (3 D) synthetic bone tissue implant scaffolds. However, implants are still unable to provide post surgery feedback. Implants often loosen due to mismatched mechanical properties of implant material and host bone. The aim of this PhD research is to fabricate an integrated strain gauge that is able to monitor implant strain for diagnosis of the bone healing process. The research work presents a method of fabricating electrical resistance strain gauge sensors using rapid and mask-less process by experimental development (design of experiment) using the nScrypt 3 Dn- 300 micro dispensing direct write (MDDW) system. Silver and carbon electrical resistance strain gauges were fabricated and characterised. Carbon <b>resistive</b> strain <b>gauges</b> with gauge factor values greater than 16 were measured using a proven cantilever bending arrangement. This represented a seven to eight fold increase in sensitivity over commercial gauges that would be glued to the implant materials. The strain sensor fabrication process was specifically developed for directly fabricating resistive strain sensor structures on synthetic bone implant surface (ceramic and titanium) {{without the use of}} glue and to provide feedback for medical diagnosis. The reported novel approach employed a biocompatible parylene C as a dielectric layer between the electric conductive titanium and the strain gauge. Work also showed that parylene C could be used as an encapsulation material over strain gauges fabricated on ceramic without modifying the performance of the strain gauge. It was found that the strain gauges fabricated on titanium had a gauge factor of 10. 0 ± 0. 7 with a near linear response to a maximum of 200 micro strain applied.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} airflows {{is an important}} area of experimental aerodynamics. MEMS technology {{has been applied to}} the measurement of wall shear stress and freestream velocity vectors. Existing methods of measuring wall shear stress vary greatly and have different strengths and weaknesses, making them each applicable to specific situations. Probes designed for measuring 3 D velocity components are relatively large in diameter, introducing significant disturbances into the airflow. The tip diameters of such probes are typically of the order of several millimetres and the minimum diameter is around 1 mm. A sensor for measuring wall shear stress, consisting of a surface fence structure 5 mm long, 750 μm high and 20 μm thick was developed. The fence, and main body on which it was mounted, were fabricated from the photo-definable polymer SU 8 with an integrated gold <b>resistive</b> strain <b>gauge</b> to measure the pressure-induced deflection. Wind tunnel testing gave a voltage output of 0. 18 mV for a shear stress of approximately 0. 35 Pa. This concept was then adapted and an in-plane cantilever sensor was developed. The cantilever sensor was manufactured from SU- 8 with an integrated <b>resistive</b> strain <b>gauge</b> of NiCr. The pressure-induced deflection of the cantilever, calibrated by the integrated strain gauge, could be related to the wall shear stress on the surface. The sensor gave a response of 9. 6 x 10 (^- 4) (mV/V) μm under mechanical deflection. For a 2 mm long, 400 μm wide cantilever when tested on a flat plate in a wind tunnel, a response of 1 mV for a shear stress of 0. 35 Pa was seen. Four cantilever sensors were arranged orthogonally to create a new type of probe for measuring flow direction and velocity, which could also measure total pressure. The probe was shown to be able to measure these variables and with further development had the potential to allow the fabrication of a smaller probe tip than that possible by conventional methods.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} heated double-sided thin film gauge configurations for transient heat transfer measurements. By heating the substrate {{it is possible to}} measure the heat flux over a range of wall temperatures, which improves the resulting regression and leads to a more accurate determination of the adiabatic wall temperature and the heat transfer coefficient. The heated gauges can be used to measure the heat transfer of a film-cooled high-pressure turbine stage with engine-realistic combustor exit flows (hot-streaks and swirl) in order to study turbine aero-thermal performance in the presence of cooling flows. This thesis also presents the aerodynamic and heat transfer design as well as the mechanical assessment of the first fully cooled turbine stage for the Oxford Turbine Research Facility (OTRF). The high-pressure turbine stage is designed for lean-burn combustor interaction effects and has engine-state external cooling features. Platinum thin film <b>resistive</b> <b>gauges</b> are the most advanced instrumentation for transient heat transfer measurement where high frequency response is required. Double-sided thin film gauges, consisting of two thin film temperature gauges mounted on either side of an insulating layer, have the advantage that the driving temperature difference is directly determined at the point of interest. A new gauge design is presented, which combines double-sided thin film gauges with the possibility to heat the substrate layer. Two arrangements of heated gauges have been developed, namely double-sided gauges with an underside thin film heater and self-heating double-sided gauges. These gauges yield an improved regression without the need for complex heating systems. The lateral conduction effects have been investigated using analytical models. The performance of different gauge types is quantified based {{on the quality of the}} regression. The heated gauge arrangements have been tested in the OTRF under engine-representative conditions on uncooled and cooled MT 1 high-pressure nozzle guide vanes. Measurement strategies have been implemented to obtain the time-dependent temperature trace over a range of heating powers and calculate the convective heat transfer. This improved measurement technique allows for an accurate determination of non-dimensional parameters such as the Nusselt number and the film cooling effectiveness. </p...|$|R

The effects of strain-rate and temperature on the sensitivity of the gauge are analyzed experimentally. From the experimental results, fabric gauges made from carbon fibers display a higher sensitivity, repeatability and accuracy than those made by stainless steel due to its small internal friction and intrinsic physics properties. Meanwhile, tubular structure has high maximum strain level than single warp structure but exhibits lower sensitivity than the latter.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The Horsetail Creek Bridge (HCB), {{constructed}} in 1914, is located along the Historic Columbia River Highway in Oregon. The original cross beams from the HCB were substantially deficient in shear strength, {{particularly for the}} projected increase in traffic loads. One control beam and three beams with varying configurations of a carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and a {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) were constructed to simulate the retrofit of the actual HCB cross beams. CFRP unidirectional fabrics were applied to increase flexural capacity and GFRP unidirectional sheets to mitigate shear failure. Thirdpoint bending tests were conducted, and load, deflection and strain data were collected. Fiber optic sensors and conventional <b>resistive</b> <b>gauges</b> were placed to provide an overall behavioral understanding of the unstrengthened and strengthened beams. Results revealed that the FRP composite strengthening provided static (total applied third-point load) capacity increases of 45 % for the addition of either CFRP or GFRP when compared to the unstrengthened beam. The addition of both CFRP and GFRP increased the moment capacity by 100 %. Post cracking stiffness of all beams was increased primarily due to the flexural CFRP. Results suggest that the experimental beams retrofit with both the designed GFRP and CFRP should well exceed the bridge design load of 530 ft-kips, sustaining up to 640 ft-kips applied moment. The addition of GFRP alone for shear was sufficient to offset the lack of steel stirrups and allow for a conventional reinforced concrete beam failure by yielding of the tension steel followed by crushing of the concrete. The resulting ultimate deflections of the shear GFRP reinforced beam were nearly twice those of the pre-existing shear deficient beam. Experimental beams retrofit with only the designed CFRP still failed as a result of diagonal tension cracks, albeit at a 45 % greater load than for the unstrengthened beam. The experimental beam retrofit with only the designed shear GFRP failed in flexure at the midspan at a 45 % higher load than the control specimen, with the failure mechanism in this case being yielding of the tension steel followed by concrete crushing. A design method for flexure and shear was proposed before the onset of this experimental study. The design procedure for flexure was refined and allows for predicting the response of the beam at any applied moment. The flexural design procedure includes provisions for non-crushing failure modes, and was shown to be slightly conservative using the design material properties...|$|R

The sensing system is analogous to a biological skin, where local strain can be monitored over a global area. In this paper, we propose the utilization of a dense network of soft elastomeric capacitors to detect, localize, and quantify damage on wind turbine blades. We also leverage mature off the shelf technologies, in particular <b>resistive</b> strain <b>gauges,</b> to augment such dense sensor network with high accuracy data at key locations, therefore constituting a hybrid dense sensor network. The proposed hybrid dense sensor network is installed inside a wind turbine blade 1 : 25 scale model, and tested in a wind tunnel to simulate an operational environment. Results demonstrate {{the ability of the}} hybrid dense sensor network to detect, localize, and quantify damage...|$|R
40|$|Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) {{has been}} {{identified}} as an area of significant potential for advanced aircraft maintenance programs that ensure continued airworthiness, enhanced operational safety and reduced life cycle cost. Several sensors and sensory systems have been developed for the implementation of such health monitoring capability. Among a wide range of developed technologies, fiber optic sensor technology, in particular fiber Bragg grating based {{emerged as one of the}} most promising for aircraft structural applications. This paper is set to explore the suitability of using a new Fiber Bragg Grating sensor (FBG) system developed for operation in two modes, low and high speed sensing modes, respectively. The suitability of the system for potential use in aircraft load monitoring and damage detection applications has been demonstrated. Results from FBG sensor system were in good agreement with results from conventional <b>resistive</b> strain <b>gauges,</b> validating this capability for load monitoring. For damage detection, the FBG sensor system was able to detect acoustic waves generated 52 inches (1. 32 m) away. The initial results, obtained in a full stale experimentation, demonstrate the potential of using FBG sensors for both load monitoring and damage detection in aircraft environment.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 65 - 70. Recently, the conduction {{properties of}} nanoparticle films have received {{great deal of}} attention due to their unique properties attributed to quantum tunneling effect. Quantum tunneling effect, highly dependent on quantum barrier height and width, is very attractive for sensor applications. <b>Resistive</b> strain <b>gauges</b> based on gold nanoparticle (Au-NP) films show high strain sensitivity. These strain gauges are applicable for miniature applications because of its size. In addition, this nanoparticle films could be also used for various applications such as pressure and vapor sensors. Clean surfaces of laser generated Au-NPs provide high tunneling decay constant. Therefore, these films are promising for high sensitive sensor applications. In our study, the Au-NPs were directly synthesized in deionized water by nanosecond laser ablation method. The clean surface, size and aggregate clusters of Au-NPs offer advantages for high sensitivity strain sensor. We prepared Au-NPs films on flexible PDMS substrate by using hands-on drop-cast method. To obtain high gauge factor, we also investigated the nanoparticle concentration on the thin films. Laser-generated AuNPs films demonstrated gauge factor of ∼ 300 for higher than 0. 22...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{electrical}} stimulation (FES) {{is a well}} established method in the rehabilitation of stroke patients. Indeed, a bilateral movement such as cycling induced by FES would be crucial for these patients who had an unilateral motor impairment and had to recover an equivalent use of limbs. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a low-cost metrologically qualified cycle-ergometer, optimized for patients with stroke. A commercial ergometer was instrumented with <b>resistive</b> strain <b>gauges</b> and was able to provide the torque produced at the right and left crank, independently. The developed system was integrated with a stimulator, obtaining a novel FES cycling device able to control in real-time the movement unbalance. A dynamic calibration of the sensors was performed and a total torque uncertainty was computed. The system was tested on a healthy subject and on a stroke patient. Results demonstrated that the proposed sensors could be successfully used during FES cycling sessions where the maximum torque produced is about 9 Nm, an order of magnitude less than the torque produced during voluntary cycling. This FES cycling system will assist in future investigations on stroke rehabilitation by means of FES and in new exercise regimes designed specifically for patients with unilateral impairments...|$|R
