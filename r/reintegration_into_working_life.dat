40|$|This paper {{sets forth}} {{selected}} {{results of the}} longitudinally-related evaluation of the employment biographies of long-term unemployed people. The focus of attention is the event-analytical consideration of the probability of returning from unemployment back into employment, the significance of human capital investments and the significance of unemployment for the income obtained. The analyses of the employment biographies of long-term employed people show that the chance of reintegration into the labour market decreases with an increasing duration of unemployment. Whereas in the old Länder as {{the length of the}} period of unemployment increases the individual characteristics prove to be relevant influential factors and the influence of labour market conditions falls, for the new Länder it can be determined that with an increasing length of unemployment the labour market conditions exert a decisive influence on the chances of returning to working life. A conclusion that is unavoidable {{as a result of the}} event analyses concerns the point of time when reintegration measures should be started. In our view the interventions must begin even earlier for the problem groups being studied. This requires that risk factors of impending longterm unemployment are recognised very early in individual cases, and counter-measures are got underway quickly, which demands a high degree of flexibility in the approval of measures. The use of funds and measures can then not be tied to certain time periods (e. g. length of the period of unemployment). Nevertheless under unfavourable labour market conditions for some risk groups a <b>reintegration</b> <b>into</b> <b>working</b> <b>life</b> is unlikely even with timely intervention.

It is therefore important to understand how VET influence young people’s expectations on empowering leadership, i.e. their implicit leadership theories (ILT).

This interpretation is in line with research in social cognition that describe how perceptions and cognitions typically are affected by the goal of belonging (Fiske and Taylor 2013), and consequently that individuals’ cognitive processes (Postmes et al. 2005) and attitudes (Kawakami et al. 2003) converge with those of other individuals within the same group.|$|R

The findings of the research shed light on a question of whether there is, in practice, a so-called “authentic vocation”, which is supposedly aligned with the mission of an individual, with his or her values, motivations, interests, knowledge, and skills. People who perform an »authentic vocation« are supposed to experience their job as a source of energy and feel deep inside that what they do is meaningful.

We subsequently relate job access at the start of the career to spatial mobility histories to analyze whether a suboptimal starting location in terms of job access leads to differing spatial mobility trajectories. Finally, we analyze how job access and spatial mobility influence labor market outcomes...|$|R

In the next part the {{attention is paid to}} the women's level of education aspirations and their motivation for studying. Students usually finish their education during the period of life, which is referred to as a young adulthood according to the evolutionary psychology.

40|$|Objectives The study {{examined}} the course of neck and shoulder pain among a cohort of technical school students entering <b>working</b> <b>life.</b> We also aimed to identify work-related and individual risk factors for neck and shoulder pain during this transition period. Methods The study {{was designed as a}} prospective cohort study following 420 technical school students (167 student hairdressers, 118 student electricians, and 135 media/design students) from school, through their apprenticeship and <b>into</b> <b>working</b> <b>life.</b> Every 4 th month over a 6. 5 year period (2002 – 2009), the participant`s neck and shoulder pain for the preceding four weeks was assessed. Mechanical and psychosocial workplace factors as well as individual factors were evaluated at baseline and/or during the follow-up period. Data were analyzed by generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results We found a significant increase in neck and shoulder pain over time in the transition from technical school to <b>working</b> <b>life.</b> High mechanical workload was associated with neck and shoulder pain among women, while a high level of shoulder muscle endurance capacity was associated with lower rates of neck and shoulder pain among men. Perceived muscle tension and ethnicity were the most consistent predictors for neck and shoulder pain, found among both women and men. Conclusion Increased neck and shoulder pain was found in the transition from technical school to <b>working</b> <b>life,</b> and both work-related and individual factors were associated with pain development.

Based on latent profile analysis, in both studies we identified four groups that were characterized by different levels of overall motivation and one group characterized by low positive affect and mean levels in autonomous goals and self-efficacy. Profiles characterized by high levels of motivation showed the highest levels of positive work expectations and goal engagement and the lowest levels of negative work expectations in Study 1 and the highest levels of person-job fit, work engagement, and job satisfaction in Study 2. Moreover, latent difference score analysis showed that motivational profiles predicted changes in person-job fit and work engagement across one year but not in job satisfaction.

40|$|AbstractHistorically, many {{individuals}} with disabilities in Norway faced exclusion from participation in mainstream society. A shift in disability policy from an emphasis on segregation to integration started {{taking place in the}} late 1960 s, and “full participation and equality” became the overall objective from the early 1980 s. In parallel, the government has developed and implemented several welfare services and programs to enhance this integration, particularly in the labor market. Based on in-depth interviews with persons with mobility disabilities, the article addresses their experiences of transitioning into mainstream employment, supported by, and navigating through a vast array of welfare services. Born in the 1970 s and early 1980 s, these study participants represent so-to-speak the first generation of integrated people with disabilities. Their stories are important when exploring how and to what extent the policy of integration enhanced labor market participation. Applying a structural perspective, the article discusses why welfare service delivery processes may become barriers along the road into mainstream employment. Informed by Fraser's (2003) “perspectival dualism,” it outlines how insufficient dimensions of redistribution and recognition impede a smooth transition <b>into</b> <b>working</b> <b>life</b> for persons with mobility disabilities, turning welfare services and programs into barriers...|$|R

40|$|Background: Clinical {{education}} {{is an essential}} part of the Bachelor’s program in Nursing and a keystone of professional nursing education. Through clinical experiences, the student nurses acquire nursing knowledge and essential skills for professional practice. The preceptor plays a vital role in the development of student nurses becoming professional nurses. Aim: The aim of this Nordic qualitative study was to explore the experiences of good preceptorship in relation to undergraduate student nurses in clinical education from the perspective of the preceptors themselves. Method: Data were collected by narrative interviews with 27 preceptors in Finland and Sweden and analyzed using a hermeneutical approach. Findings: A caring relationship, based on caring ethics, is seen as the foundation for learning and development. Moreover, a mutual respect is a prerequisite for fellowship and a good atmosphere. As such, encounters are characterized by reciprocity and mutuality. The preceptors have a deep sense of responsibility toward the students and the profession. Furthermore, the preceptors have an inner responsibility to guide the students <b>into</b> <b>working</b> <b>life</b> and to share their knowledge by acting as role models. Conclusion: The findings suggest that preceptorship should be examined through new lenses. Moreover, preceptorship is an ethical issue that should be recognized by all stakeholders...|$|R
