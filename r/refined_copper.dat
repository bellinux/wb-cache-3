25|$|Most often, {{magnetic}} wire {{is composed of}} fully annealed, electrolytically <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> to allow closer winding when making electromagnetic coils. The wire is coated {{with a range of}} polymeric insulations, including varnish, rather than the thicker plastic or other types of insulation commonly used on electrical wire. High-purity oxygen-free copper grades are used for high-temperature applications in reducing atmospheres or in motors or generators cooled by hydrogen gas.|$|E
25|$|Crofton {{was founded}} in 1902 by Henry Croft, who owned the nearby copper mine in Mt. Sicker. He built a smelter on the coast and {{exported}} the <b>refined</b> <b>copper.</b> The residue {{left over from the}} smelter blackened the local beaches, and the small glass particles often stuck to peoples' feet and hands. In 1906 Henry Croft sold the smelter to Britannia Mine. The smelter closed in January 1908, and soon after, rumours began that a large sawmill would be built. Nothing came of the rumours, and when Henry Croft died in 1917, his namesake was struggling to survive.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, MIM's <b>copper</b> <b>refining</b> {{subsidiary}} {{developed the}} Isa Process <b>copper</b> <b>refining</b> technology, {{which is now}} marketed as the IsaKidd process and globally regarded as the preferred <b>copper</b> <b>refining</b> technology, with over 100 licencees using the technology around the world. The Isa Process technology revolutionized <b>copper</b> <b>refining</b> by replacing <b>copper</b> cathode-starter-sheets with stainless steel sheets and allowing {{what had been a}} very labour-intensive process to be mechanised.|$|R
50|$|This {{process is}} widely used in metals refining. For example, in <b>copper</b> <b>refining,</b> <b>copper</b> anodes, an {{intermediate}} product from the furnaces, are electrolysed in an appropriate solution (such as sulfuric acid) to yield high purity (99.99%) cathodes. Copper cathodes produced using this method are also described as electrolytic copper.|$|R
25|$|By {{working with}} Motorola, AMD {{was able to}} <b>refine</b> <b>copper</b> {{interconnect}} manufacturing to the production stage about one year before Intel. The revised process permitted 180-nanometer processor production. The accompanying die-shrink resulted in lower power consumption, permitting AMD to increase Athlon clock speeds to the 1GHz range. Yields on the new process exceeded expectations, permitting AMD to deliver high speed chips in volume in March 2000.|$|R
50|$|Africa’s <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> {{production}} rose by 40% from 2000 to 2005; increased {{production from}} the Bwana Mkubwa and the Mufulira plants in Zambia {{more than offset}} lower South African output. In South Africa, production declined because of lower output from the Palabora refinery. In 2005, Zambia accounted for 77% of African <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> production; South Africa, 19%; and Egypt, 3%. Congo (Kinshasa), which accounted for 37% of continental <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> output in 1990, had ceased production by 2000. Egypt was the only producer of secondary refined copper; primary production accounted for most African production.|$|E

50|$|The {{production}} of <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> {{was expected to}} rise {{by an average of}} 17% per year from 2005 to 2011. Zambia’s production is expected to increase because of higher output from the Mufulira refinery and the Bwana Mkubwa and the Kansanshi solvent extraction-electrowinning (SX-EW) plants in 2006 and the Konkola SX-EW plants by 2007. In Congo (Kinshasa), new SX-EW plants could open at the Kolwezi Tailings project and the Mutoshi Mine in early 2008, and at the KOV Mine in late 2009. CAMEC planned to start production at the Luita plant in 2008. Congo (Kinshasa), which did not produce <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> in 2000, could account for more than 25% of Africa’s <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> output by 2011.|$|E

50|$|The world {{production}} of selenium is around 1500 metric tons per year, {{out of which}} roughly 10% is recycled. Japan is the largest producer, producing 800 metric tons of selenium per year. Other large producers include Belgium (300 metric tons per year), the United States (over 200 metric tons per year), Sweden (130 metric tons per year), and Russia (100 metric tons per year). Selenium can be extracted from the waste from the process of electrolytically <b>refining</b> <b>copper.</b> Another method of producing selenium is to farm selenium-gathering plants such as milk vetch. This method could produce three kilograms of selenium per acre, but is not commonly practiced.|$|R

5000|$|CIPEC {{represented}} around 30% of the world's <b>refined</b> <b>copper,</b> {{and more}} than 50% of the proven reserves of copper. The intent of the members to secure higher prices failed, particularly of increasing the price during the crisis of 1975-1976, and the subsequent change of behavior of Chile finally finished the cartel.|$|E
50|$|Trading prospered, and a jetty {{was built}} in 1861 for ships to bring in coal, timber, food and mining equipment. The first load of <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> was shipped in 1862, and by 1868 over 100 tons were {{produced}} each week. Distilled sulphuric acid was also produced and superphosphate was manufactured between the 1890s and 1920s.|$|E
50|$|Given {{this more}} {{favourable}} context, Phelps Dodge, a United States mining {{company and the}} Sumitomo Metal Mining Company, a Japanese firm, signed a US$1.5 billion contract in 1992 with the Chilean government to develop La Candelaria, a copper and gold mine south of Copiapó. The mine's potential production of <b>refined</b> <b>copper</b> was equivalent to about 10 percent of Codelco's entire production.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, a process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of <b>refining</b> <b>copper</b> or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.|$|R
50|$|When Duncan McKechnie {{became a}} {{director}} of the United Alkali Company, his sons Daniel Montgomery and Alexander Miller founded a smelting business known as McKechnie Brothers, and opened a new factory in Widnes <b>refining</b> <b>copper</b> and silver. Daniel died in 1914, and the following year it became a limited company with its headquarters in Birmingham. The company diversified its products, developing and selling the by-products of the smelting process. In 1920 they moved their headquarters back to Widnes. McKechnie Brothers became a public company in 1953, with the family holding a majority of voting rights. Diversification continued with the addition of plastics to their products. The family eventually lost overall control of the company in 1971. New businesses were acquired, and in 1984 the company was renamed McKechnie plc.|$|R
