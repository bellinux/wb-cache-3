500|$|The {{properties}} of cobaltocene reported by Wilkinson and Fischer {{demonstrated that the}} unipositive cobalticinium cation + exhibited stability {{similar to that of}} ferrocene itself. This observation is not unexpected given that the cobalticinium cation and ferrocene are isoelectronic, although the bonding was not understood at the time. Nevertheless, the observation led Wilkinson and F. Albert Cotton to attempt the synthesis of rhodocenium and iridocenium salts. They reported the synthesis of numerous rhodocenium salts, including those containing the tribromide (Br3), perchlorate (ClO4), and <b>reineckate</b> ( [...] ·H2O) anions, and found that the addition of dipicrylamine produced a compound of composition [...] In each case, the rhodocenium cation was found to possess high stability. Wilkinson and Fischer went on to share the 1973 Nobel Prize for Chemistry [...] "for their pioneering work, performed independently, on the chemistry of the organometallic, so called sandwich compounds".|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityOver {{the past}} ten to fifteen years much {{work has been done}} on {{oxidation}} and reduction reactions of coordination complexes in aqueous solution. Relatively little attention has been devoted, however, to the study of reactions in which ligands of these complexes are oxidized or reduced. In the present work an investigation was carried out on the bromine oxidation of the isothiocyanatopentamiminechromium(III) ion and of tetraisothiocyanatodiamminechromate(III) ion. 		Werner (16) studied the bromine oxidation of ammonium <b>reineckate,</b> and after extensive treatment of the reaction solution isolated the green salt [Cr(NH 3) 2 (Br) 2 (H 2 O) 2]Br. In the present study, an attempt was made to establish the stoichiometry of the bromine oxidations of the <b>Reineckate</b> ion and the [Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS]+ 2 ion. Work was done on the identification of the oxidation products and on correlation of these products with the observed stoichiometry. The oxidation of the <b>Reineckate</b> ion was carried out in both buffered solution, at a pH of 4. 5 - 5, and acidic solution, with a pH of 1 - 2, in order to note any difference in the measured stoichiometries with the change in acidity. Measurements were also made to determine if dissociation of the complex preceded the initial oxidation step. 		[Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS](ClO 4) 2 was prepared from [Cr(NH 3) 5 Cl] by a procedure based on the method of Adamson and Wilkins (3). The [Cr(NH 3) 5 Cl]Cl 2 was prepared by the reduction of chromic ion to chromous ion by zinc in the presence of acid. The chromous ion by zinc in the presence of acid. The chromous ion was then oxidized by air in the presence of ammonium chloride in aqueous ammonia. This solution was treated with hot hydrochloric acid to obtain the internediate [Cr(NH 3) 5 Cl]Cl 2. 		The following procedure was used to determine the rate of consumption of bromine and extablish the stoichiometry of the reactant species. Definite volumes of solution containing complex ion and hydrochloric acid or acetate buffer were placed in one flask, and the same volumes of blank solution containing hydrochloric acid or buffer, but no complex, wwere placed in another flask. A certain volume of aqueous bromine was added to each flask, and after a certain selected time, the remaining bromine was quenched with protassium iodide. The liberated iodine was titrated with standard sodium thiosulfate solution using starch as an indicator. The stoichiometries (the moles of bromine consumed per mole of complex ion) were determined using this same method. The chromium content of each solution of complex was determined by destroying the complex in hot alkali, oxidizing the chromite ion solution to chromate ion by hot hydrogen peroxide, and measuring the absorbance of the resulting chromate solution at a wave length of 372 millimicrons. 		From the measurements made on the bromine oxidation of <b>Reineckate</b> ion, it appears that there is an initial rapid reaction followed by a slower consumption of bromine. 		From the available data concerning the oxidation of [Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS]+ 2, there also appears to be an initial rapid consumption of bromine. Measurements did not indicate a slower consumption of bromine. 		Allowing the buffered oxidation of <b>Reineckate</b> ion by bromine to take place for 10 minutes, at a pH of 4. 5 - 5, the observed stoichiometry was 14. 2 moles of bromine per mole of <b>Reineckate</b> ion. In acidic solution, at a pH of 1 - 2, the apparent stoichiometry of the <b>Reineckate</b> ion oxidation was 14. 0 moles of bromine per mole of <b>Reineckate</b> ion. 		The stoichiometry of the [Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS]+ 2 ion oxidation, allowing the reaction to take place for 15 minutes, was 3. 2 moles of bromine consumed per mole of complex ion. 		Sulfate ion and nitrate ion were both identified as products of the <b>Reineckate</b> ion oxidation. The cyanide ion and the ammonium ion were not detected and are thus ruled out as possible oxidation products. No suitable test was devised for the identification of carbon dioxide. 		More work should be done on the study of the slower secondary oxidation by bromine of <b>Reineckate</b> ion. The bromine oxidation of [Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS]+ 2 should be investigated in more detail and perhaps a comparison of the oxidation rates of it and the <b>Reineckate</b> ion could be made where possible. A reaction apparatus should be designed which would trap any gaseous oxidation products formed and a correlation could be made between the reaction products formed during each reaction interval and the observed stoichiometries...|$|E

The ion exchange paper, amberlite SA- 2 was used. A dimethyl sulfoxide solution of the <b>reineckate</b> was spotted at the starting point that was at a 4 cm distance from the bottom edge of the ion exchange paper strip. The strip was hung in a chamber at 30 ℃, the bottom edge of strip was immersed in lM-Na 2 HPO 4 -NaOH buffer solution (pH 13. 30), and the ascending development was applied. After the run was completed, the strip was dried and passed through a freshly prepared solution of 2 % phosphomolybdic acid in lM hydrochloric acid. The presence of the bases was evidenced by the appearance of the yellow spot. Under such a condition, Rf values of the bases were as follows: 0. 44 for choline, 0. 20 for neurine, 0. 18 for tetraethylammonium, 0. 79 for betaine alde- hyde, 0. 74 for creatinine, and 0. 39 for antipyrine.

D. of ca. ± 1. 5 % (n = 3) for all three analytes of interest. Finally, the method proposed has been applied to the determination of the three drugs in pharmaceutical formulations and urine, when the results obtained were comparable to those obtained with the reference HPLC measurements...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{communications}} {{from this}} laboratory {{have described the}} production of biochemical mutants in the mold Neurospora by means of ultraviolet and x-rays (1, 2). Such mutants are characterized by the inability to carry out specific chemical syntheses which normally occur in the unmutated, or wild type, strain. In each case which has been genetically analyzed {{the failure of the}} synthesis {{has been found to be}} related to the mutation of a single gene. The strain to be described, known as No. 34486, or cholineless, arose from a culture of wild type Neurospora crassa which had been irradiated with ultraviolet light. It was found to be unable to grow in a medium containing only salts, sugar, and biotin, but it grew normally on the addition of a mixture of water-soluble vitamins. When the components of the mixture were tested singly, it was found that the addition of choline alone permitted normal growth. Up to the present, no completely satisfactory method for the determination of choline in natural products and tissue extracts has been described. Chemical methods, such as precipitation of the <b>reineckate,</b> lack specificity, while the biological method of Fletcher, Best, and Solandt (3) is time-consuming and difficult, and “possesses many dangerous pitfalls for the chemist” (4). The whole subject has been critically reviewed by Best and Lucas (4). It was therefore of interest to determine whether the Neurospora mutant is a suitable test organism in a quantitative assay for choline. The experiments to be described show that this is the case and form the basis of a simple, sensitive, and specific method for the determination of choline in natural products. By this procedure it is possible to determine choline in a concentration of 0. 02 mg. per liter; routine analyses can be run on 100 mg. samples of material...|$|E
40|$|Among {{numerous}} Streptomyces-strains {{isolated from}} soils, F 1001, so-called in our laboratory, exhibited the widest inhibition zone against pathogenic {{bacteria in the}} course of our screening-tests. The fact suggests that this strain has an ability to produce the antibiotic in a large amount. Spirals are formed at the ends of hyphae only on the agarmedia extremely poor in nutrients. The hyphae excrete brown pigments that diffuse into the media, when a protein component such as meat extract or peptone is added. From this the strain seems to be of Chromogenus type. Judging from several taxonomic characteristics, we have identified it as one strain of Streptomyces aureus (Waksman and Curtius) group. Cultivation of the strain on 6 kinds of media of different compositions showed the glucose bouillon medium, rendered semicolloidal by adding 0. 25 % agar, as most suitable for the production of antibiotics. Optimum pH of the broth for growth as well as for potency is 7. 0, and optimum temperature for growth is 24 ℃, while that for potency is 30 ℃. Broth filtrates inhibit the growth of Staph. aureus in about 20, 000, 000 dilution, E scher. coli in about 200, 000 dilution. Next we tried to extract active substances out of broth by the usual method and have got a white powder with pale yellowish brown tincture. As a solvent for elution of active substances from charcoal, methanol acidified by hydrochloric acid (pH 2) is excellent, and methanol acidified by sulfuric acid (same pH) falls behind. The powder gives brown colored Sakaguchi-reaction, and forms crystalline <b>reineckate</b> as well as helianthate. It is able to inhibit the growth of all the three groups of pathogenic bacteria i. e., Gram positive, Gram negative and acid-fast bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis bovine type). Lytic action upon bacterial bodies is not so conspicuous. Concerning heat stability, it is indifferent to 3 -minute heating at 100 ℃, while the potency decreases considerably by 5 -minute heating at 100 ℃...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Silver {{and copper}} all-solid state wire sensor {{electrodes}} of quininium cation with different ion exchangers {{have been prepared}} and used in pharmaceutical analysis. A comparative study with a reference method is applied in order to investigate {{the validity of the}} proposed method for potentiometric analysis of pharmaceutical compounds containing quinine. Approach: A Nernstian equation was proved for all electrodes of quinine in this research. Potentiometric investigations were carried out to identify the characteristic performance of the electrodes, such as the life span, pH effect and effect of the interfering ions. Chemometric and statistical studies of the chemical analysis of quinine in pharmaceutical compounds were applied using different type of electrodes compared to a reference method. Results: A Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) membrane electrodes of silver (Ag) and Copper (Cu) Coated Wire Electrodes (CWEs) were prepared for quininium cation (Qn +). The ion exchangers were ion-pairs and ion associates of Qn+ with different counter-anions, such as <b>reineckate</b> (Rn -), phosphotungstate (PT 3 -) and phosphomolybdate (PM 3 -). The Qn-CWEs showed a Nernstian response for a maximum 24 h at 25 °C, except with that based on Cu- Qn 3 PM. Conclusion/Recommendations: The ion pair QnRn and the ion associates Qn 3 PT and Qn 3 PM are very efficient ion exchangers for the construction of Qn-CWEs. The performance characteristics (life span, pH effect and the selectivity) proved that such electrodes can be successfully used for the potentiometric micro-determination of Qn 2 SO 4 in its pharmaceutical preparation. The analytical application showed that the recoveries and relative standard deviation of different Qn-CWEs reveals a high degree of accuracy and precision. In spite of their high accuracy, the F- test conclude the fact that the reference method is usually more precise than proposed method introduced in this study except for Ag-Qn 3 PM electrode. In general, Ag-Qn 3 PM CWE showed a discrete behavior regarding accuracy and silver metal preference. Further application of this type of electrodes on different pharmaceutical compounds is recommended to countervail the trends on the performance characteristics and confront the statistical parameters...|$|E
