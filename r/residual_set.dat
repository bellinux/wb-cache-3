40|$|The {{objective}} of the International Diagnostic Competition {{is to provide a}} platform for eval-uating how different diagnostic algorithms per-form and compare to one another when applied to the same problem. This paper describes three model-based diagnosis algorithms entered into the Fourth International Diagnostic Competition. We focus on the first diagnostic problem of the in-dustrial track of the competition in which a diag-nosis algorithm must detect, isolate, and identify faults in an electrical power distribution testbed in order to provide abort recommendations when warranted. We present here a general fault iso-lation framework that encompasses three algo-rithms, each of which use different <b>residual</b> <b>sets</b> for fault isolation; one based on the global system model, one based on minimal submodels com-puted using Possible Conflicts, and one based on the combination of the former two <b>residual</b> <b>sets.</b> We describe, compare, and contrast the three al-gorithms in terms of practical implementation and their diagnosis results. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to model {{differential}} rates over <b>residual</b> information <b>sets,</b> so as to shape transactional algebras into operational grounds. Firstly, simple differential rates over <b>residual</b> information <b>sets</b> are introduced by taking advantage of finite algebras of sets. Secondly, after contextual sets and the relevant algebra of information sets is suitably fashioned, generalized differential rates over <b>residual</b> information <b>sets</b> are expanded on, while a recursive algorithm is set forth to characterize such rates and sets. Thirdly, the notion of transactional algebra is presented and heed is given to the costs of running such structure. Finally, an application to financial arbitrage processes is fully developed within a transactional algebra, setting up arbitrage returns net of transaction costs, establishing boundary conditions for an arbitrage to take place, and finally allowing for a definition of what should be meant by financial arbitrage within a transactional algebra. differential rates, <b>residual</b> information <b>sets,</b> transactional algebras, arbitrage...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work aims at {{evaluating}} {{the use of}} TS MIMO model for the Detection and Isolation of faults of sensors on a nonlinear process. TS model involves a set of local linear models whose contribution on the output signals is expressed by a weighting function. In a previous work, an identification scheme was proposed for TS MIMO model. It doesn't need for the outputs of the process to be separable, as {{it is usually the}} case for the identification methods based on MISO model. A model-based method, for faults detection is proposed from the identified model. This new approach differs from the observers and parity space based approaches, as it only uses a partial knowledge of the model. Outputs are projected into a sub-space that is orthogonal to the sequences of input-output weighted signals to provide a <b>residuals</b> <b>set.</b> The process of fault isolation exploits the structure of the <b>residuals</b> <b>set</b> in order to recognize the acting fault. The sensitivity of the residuals to the occurrence of faults is proved while the incidence matrix of the residuals is deduced from simulation.

50|$|Jarník's work in real {{analysis}} was sparked by finding, in the unpublished works of Bernard Bolzano, {{a definition of}} a continuous function that was nowhere differentiable. Bolzano's 1830 discovery predated the 1872 publication of the Weierstrass function, previously {{considered to be the}} first example of such a function. Based on his study of Bolzano's function, Jarník was led to a more general theorem: If a real-valued function of a closed interval does not have bounded variation in any subinterval, then there is a dense subset of its domain on which at least one of its Dini derivatives is infinite. This applies in particular to the nowhere-differentiable functions, as they must have unbounded variation in all intervals. Later, after learning of a result by Stefan Banach and Stefan Mazurkiewicz that generic functions (that is, the members of a <b>residual</b> <b>set</b> of functions) are nowhere differentiable, Jarník proved that at almost all points, all four Dini derivatives of such a function are infinite. Much of his later work in this area concerned extensions of these results to approximate derivatives.|$|E
