For this purpose, it focuses on the relevance of goodwill values in companies’ accounts (which is mainly investigated {{through a set of}} three ratios, comparing goodwill values with the total shareholders’ equity, with the total assets book value and with market capitalisation) and on the dynamics of stated goodwill values through time (observing the changes of the <b>relevance</b> <b>ratios</b> and separately analysing the effects on goodwill values of: impairment losses, mergers & acquisitions, adjustments to provisional values, dismissals, exchange differences, and other or not specified determinants). Empirical evidences from the 350 consolidated financial statements of the 70 largest Italian listed companies for the five years 2005 - 2009 showed that the IAS/IFRS accounting treatment for goodwill is determining an endemic process of progressive accumulation of goodwill values in companies’ consolidated financial statements, with the capitalisation of massive goodwill values when M&As are concluded, while impairment losses tend to be insignificant, even in the presence of adverse conditions of financial markets and real economy. Looking at its actual effects on companies’ accounts, the IAS/IFRS goodwill accounting treatment appears to be at least as equally unsatisfactory as the previous treatments it has replaced...|$|R

In 58 samples of NSCLC tissue and normal adjacent tissue, methylation of the RUNX 3 gene promoter was measured by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Correlation with clinicopathological characteristics was assessed. The results demonstrated that RUNX 3 gene promoter methylation was present in 26 / 58 (44. 8 %) of NSCLC tissue samples and 10 / 58 (17. 2 %) of normal tissue samples, and that the difference was statistically significant between the two groups (χ 2 = 10. 311, p= 0. 001).

The increasement of the <b>relevance</b> <b>ratio</b> of ALK will be very important to patients. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the clinical pathological features of ALK positive lung cancer, and the roles of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in screening and confirming the ALK positive cases in the testing flow of ALK. Methods IHC analysis of ALK in tumor specimens was performed on 525 lung cancer patients. 34 cases among them were confirmed by FISH. Results The positive incidence of ALK by IHC was 5. 14 % (27 / 525). The ALK positive patients were significantly younger than ALK negative patients (P< 0. 05), and femal was predominant (P< 0. 05). The proportion of solid predominant adenocarcinoma was significantly higher in ALK positive patients (P< 0. 05). While acinar and lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma were significantly lower in ALK positive patients (P< 0. 05). FISH was applied in 34 cases. The coincidence rate was increased with the increasement of positive intensity of IHC staining. All the IHC positive cases with or without EGFR mutation must be confirmed by FISH.

The importance {{of this study is to}} make people understand that everybody can accept or violate one or more conversational maxims, particularly in the casual setting in the use of Bahasa Indonesia. In analyzing this conversational maxims, the writer uses the theory of The Cooperative Principle and The Conversational Maxims by Paul Grice (1975) that are used to decide whether the utterances accept those maxims or violate them. The writer used the qualitative approach since the data are in the form of words. The method of this study is to describe the context in terms of aims, such as, setting, participants, function, and topics; identify the types of maxims; and utterances which accepted or violated one of the conversational maxims. The overall findings show that the most frequent conversational maxims which occur is the maxim of quantity, and is followed by the maxim of relevance.

40|$|Cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 D 6 can metabolize about 25 % of {{clinical}} drugs and {{is subject to}} inhibition and polymorphism with significant clinical consequences. The elucidation of its crystal structure has provided very useful information on molecular interaction, specificity, and selectivity. However, the resolved structure of CYP 2 D 6 is ligand-free, and thus how and whether ligand binding induces conformational changes of the active site is unknown. The molecular factors affecting the binding of compounds to CYP 2 D 6 are also not fully elucidated. Herbal medicines may result in potential adverse herb-drug interactions when used in combination with conventional drugs. But, because of their complicated chemical composition and limited in vivo and in vitro approaches, there are limited data on the binding affinities and binding mechanisms of herbal compounds with CYP 2 D 6. In this regard, we hypothesize {{that a number of}} physicochemical factors determine the binding of compounds to human CYP 2 D 6, and that a number of compounds share similar structural features, and therefore binding features as CYP 2 D 6 substrates/inhibitors. Thus, the objectives of the current project are: (1) to further explore the molecular factors determining the binding of a compound to native and mutated CYP 2 D 6; (2) to develop a QSAR model for the prediction of binding strength of compounds to CYP 2 D 6; and (3) to examine the binding of Chinese herbal compounds from S. baicalensis/Fangjifuling decoction with CYP 2 D 6. In this study, we have developed and validated pharmacophore models for the CYP 2 D 6 substrates/inhibitors. The models all consisted of two hydrophobic features and one hydrogen bond acceptor feature, with a <b>relevance</b> <b>ratio</b> of 76 % for substrates and 78. 8 % for inhibitors. QSAR models for the prediction of binding affinity of ligands to CYP 2 D 6 were also have been constructed and validated (y= 0. 980 x+ 2. 829 for substrates and y= 0. 948 x+ 1. 051 for inhibitors). In docking study, 117 out of 120 substrates and 30 out of 33 inhibitors could be docked into the active site of CYP 2 D 6. Eleven residues for substrates and 8 residues for inhibitors presented an important role in their binding and consequently determining the metabolic activity towards the substrate/inhibitor selectivity. Apparent changes of the binding modes have been observed with Phe 120 Ile, Glu 216 Asp, Asp 301 Glu mutations, when five probe substrates and four known inhibitors were be tested. Eighteen out of 40 compounds from S. baicalensis and 60 out of 130 compounds from Fangjifuling decoction were mapped with our optimized pharmacophore models. Among them, 100 % compounds from S. baicalensis and 90 % from Fangjifuling decoction could be docked into the active site, which suggested that they may be substrates/inhibitors of CYP 2 D 6. The role of Phe 120, Glu 216, Asp 301, Ser 304 for herbal compound binding to CYP 2 D 6 has been further supported by our docking studies. In conclusion, our project has documented the main molecular factors determining the binding of a compound to native and mutated CYP 2 D 6, which allow us to predict and understand the interaction between molecules and CYP 2 D 6. We also have demonstrated the use of an effective and efficient computational approach to studying the molecular mechanisms of interaction of herbal compounds and functionally important proteins...|$|E

We hypothesized that the association between follow-up noncontrast computed tomography ILV and outcome as assessed with mRS 3 months after stroke is strengthened when taking the mRS relevance of the infarct location into account. An anatomic atlas with 66 areas was registered to the follow-up noncontrast computed tomographic images of 254 patients from the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). The anatomic brain areas were divided into brain areas of high, moderate, and low mRS relevance {{as reported in the}} literature. Based on this distinction, the ILV in brain areas of high, moderate, and low mRS relevance was assessed for each patient. Binary and ordinal logistic regression analyses with and without adjustment for known confounders were performed to assess the association between the ILVs of different mRS relevance and outcome. The odds for a worse outcome (higher mRS) were markedly higher given an increase of ILV in brain areas of high mRS <b>relevance</b> (odds <b>ratio,</b> 1. 42; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 31 - 1. 55 per 10 mL) compared with an increase in total ILV (odds ratios, 1. 16; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 12 - 1. 19 per 10 mL).

(see also Fig. 1). It can be observed that generally concrete softening increases its <b>relevance</b> as the <b>ratio</b> between average compressive stress and concrete strength becomes higher.|$|R
40|$|The {{stereo vision}} {{results from the}} {{interaction}} between geometrical optics and visual psychology. Large depth will bring discomforts {{for the results of}} ghosting and °icker. The <b>relevance</b> of the <b>ratio</b> of jumping out depth (RJD) and electroencephalogram (EEG) gravity frequency (GF) was explored to re°ect human health under di®erent three-dimensional (3 D) depth information (mainly the negative disparity) displayed on a three-dimensional television (3 D-TV) with shutter glasses. EEG was obtained from 10 volunteers when they were watching 3 D ¯lm segments with di®erent negative disparities. The brain GF map shows that the depth information has a stronger in°uence on the frontal lobe than on the occipital lobe. For regression analysis, nonlinear curve ¯ttings of GF to RJD in Fp 1, F 3, O 2 and T 5 channels were mainly performed when RJD ranged from 0 to 3. 4, while linear ¯ttings were performed in some special RJD ranges. It also con¯rms that RJD above 2. 2 may lead to discomfort to human body. Finally, it suggests a suitable RJD range for people to watch from the objective method. The outcomes {{can be used as a}} guidance to decrease human discomforts induced by 3 D production...|$|R
40|$|The {{pendular}} {{motion of}} a giant censer (O Botafumeiro) that hangs in the transept of the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, and is cyclically pumped by men who pull at the supporting rope, is analyzed. Maximum angular amplitude attainable, and number of cycles and time needed to attain it, are calculated; the results agree with observed values (82 °, 17 cycles, 80 seconds) to the few percent accuracy of both the analysis and the observations and parameter measurements. The energy gain in a pumping cycle is obtained for an arbitrary pumping procedure to two orders in the small fractional change of pendular length; the <b>relevance</b> of the <b>ratio</b> (characteristic radial acceleration during pumping) /g to the gain is discussed- Effects due to rope mass, air drag on both Censer and rope, {{and the fact that}} the Censer is not a point mass, are considered. If the pumping cycle is inverted once the maximum amplitude has been attained, the Censer could be swiftly brought to rest, avoiding the usual violent stop. Historically recorded accidents, rope shape, and the influence of relevant parameters on the motion are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the ubiquitously {{expressed}} gene PTEN-induced kinase 1 (Pink 1) cause {{autosomal recessive}} Parkinson’s disease. Pink 1 encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. The mechanism {{that leads to}} selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons via Pink 1 mutations is unknown. A full-length pre-protein (66 kDa) and an N-terminally truncated mature form (55 kDa) have been described in human brain. Here, we report that the endogenous 66 kDa and 55 kDa Pink 1 forms in cultured cells are not exclusive to mitochondria but also occur in cytosolic and microsome-rich fractions. Pink 1 66 kDa is the predominant isoform in cultured cells. Using unbiased ana-lyses of immunoisolated Pink 1 complexes by mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation and Hsp 90 inhibi-tor studies, we identify Pink 1 as a novel Cdc 37 /Hsp 90 client kinase. This chaperone system influences both the subcellular distribution and the 66 / 55 kDa protein ratio of Pink 1. PD-causing Pink 1 mutations decrease whereas Parkin expression increases the Pink 1 66 / 55 kDa protein ratio, biochemically linking Pink 1 and Parkin and highlighting the potential <b>relevance</b> of this <b>ratio</b> for PD pathogenesis. Finally, we document the influence of Parkin on Pink 1 subcellular distribution, providing further evidence for a common pathogenic pathway in recessive PD...|$|R
