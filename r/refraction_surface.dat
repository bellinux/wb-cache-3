40|$|Abstract. Non-invasive {{high-resolution}} geophysical techniques, such as {{ground penetrating radar}} (GPR), electrical tomography and seismics, {{have been}} applied in archaeological investigations during a geophysical survey, {{which took place in}} the archaeological site of Itanos in Greece. The main objective of survey was to delineate the remains of buried relics in selected areas by combining these high-resolution geophysical methods. Three sets of GPR antennas were employed to achieve optimal system performance. GPR time slices, presented in a series of maps and electrical tomography resistivity sections revealed features at different depths related to soil resistance and magnetic gradient anomalies, attributed to buried relics of building walls. In particular, in the ancient harbor compatible results were obtained from seismic <b>refraction,</b> <b>surface</b> waves, GPR, electrical tomography and other geophysical methods, indicating that the depth to the bedrock is varying from 2 to 10 m...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the velocity semblance analysis technique for air-coupled common midpoint (CMP) measurements with a small antenna offset. The technique was originally developed for seismic surveys, assuming the small spread approximation. Owing to the strong <b>refraction</b> at the <b>surface</b> and shallow investigation depth, this assumption is not valid in the case of air-coupled ground-penetrating radar (GPR). To overcome this assumption, a modification to the method is proposed accounting for the <b>refraction</b> at the <b>surface.</b> Synthetic experiments were executed to demonstrate that the traditional method resulted in a persistent overestimation, whereas the modified method improved the results significantly. Two field experiments have been conducted to test the method under different field conditions. In a first experiment on a road test site, the modified method improved the estimation of depth and propagation velocity significantly. However, the technique failed to estimate the propagation velocity and depth or objects in a second field test, due to rough terrain conditions and noise in the data. Therefore, an additional modi- fication was proposed, by incorporating in-line data as well. This improved the depth and velocity estimations significantly. Overall, this study demonstrates that the traditional velocity semblance analysis (TRAD) is not valid for air-coupled GPR. By accounting for the <b>refraction</b> at the <b>surface</b> and incorporating inline data, it is possible to successfully estimate depth and propagation velocity with small offset air-coupled GPR configurations...|$|R

Acoustic measurements were made with low-frequency microphone systems placed {{on the ground at}} five downwind sites ranging from 300 m to 10, 000 m (6. 3 mile) away from the wind turbine. The wind turbine fundamental was 1 Hz and the wind speed was generally 12 - 15 m/s at the hub height (80 m). The harmonic levels, when plotted versus propagation distance, exhibit a 3 dB per doubling of distance divergence. Two plausible explanations identified for this cylindrical spreading behavior were {{propagation of}} the low frequency wind turbine noise via a surface wave and downwind <b>refraction.</b> <b>Surface</b> was amplitude predictions were found to be more than 20 dB smaller than the measured levels.

Although many materials support SPPs, the choice of metal for most applications {{has been based on}} traditional plasmonic materials (Ag, Au) because there have been no side-by-side comparisons of the different materials on well-defined, nanostructured surfaces. Here, we report a platform that not only enabled rapid screening {{of a wide range of}} metals under different excitation conditions and dielectric environments, but also identified new and unexpected materials for biosensing applications. Nanopyramidal gratings were used to generate plasmon dispersion diagrams for Al, Ag, Au, Cu, and Pd. Surprisingly, the SPP coupling efficiencies of Cu and Al exceeded widely used plasmonic materials under certain excitation conditions. Furthermore, grazing angle excitation led to the highest refractive index sensitivities (figure of merit > 85) reported at optical frequencies because of extremely narrow SPP resonances (full-width-at-half-minimum < 6 nm or 7 meV). Finally, our screening process revealed that Ag, with the highest sensitivity, was not necessarily the preferred material for detecting molecules. We discovered that Au and even Pd, a weak plasmonic material, showed comparable index shifts on formation of a protein monolayer...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} ~ 1 [*]Hz {{magnetic}} compressional waves observed in Mercury's inner magnetosphere {{could be interpreted}} as ion‐Bernstein waves in a moderate proton beta ~ 0. 1 plasma. An observation of a proton distribution with a large planetary loss cone is presented, and we show that this type of distribution is highly unstable to the generation of ion‐Bernstein waves with low magnetic compression. Ray tracing shows that as these waves propagate back and forth about the magnetic equator; they cycle between a state of low and high magnetic compression. The group velocity decreases during the high‐compression state leading to a pileup of compressional wave energy, which could explain the observed dominance of the highly compressional waves. This bimodal nature is due to the complexity of the index of <b>refraction</b> <b>surface</b> in a warm plasma whose upper branch has high growth rate with low compression, and its lower branch has low growth/damping rate with strong compression. Two different cycles are found: one where the compression maximum occurs at the magnetic equator and one where the compression maximum straddles the magnetic equator. The later cycle could explain observations where the maximum in compression straddles the equator. Ray tracing shows that this mode is confined within ± 12 ° magnetic latitude which can account for the bulk of the observations. We show that the Doppler shift can account for the difference between the observed and model wave frequency, if the wave vector direction is in opposition to the plasma flow direction. We note that the Wentzel‐Kramers‐Brillouin approximation breaks down during the pileup of compressional energy and that a study involving full wave solutions is required.

Methods: 30 patients with soft toric lenses having more than 1. 25 D of corneal astigmatism (25 eyes; Group A) or having 0. 75 &ndash; 1. 25 D of corneal astigmatism (22 eyes; Group B) and 30 patients with soft spheric lenses having 0. 75 &ndash; 1. 25 D of corneal astigmatism (28 eyes; Group C) or less than 0. 75 D of corneal astigmatism (23 eyes; Group D) {{were included in the}} study. Corrected and uncorrected monocular visual acuity measurement with logMAR, biomicroscopic properties, autorefractometry and corneal topography were performed for all patients immediately before and at least 20 minutes after the application of contact lenses. &shy;Success of contact lens fitting was evaluated by three parameters: astigmatic neutralization, visual success, and retinal deviation. Results: After soft toric lens application, spheric dioptres, cylindric and keratometric astigmatism, and retinal deviation decreased significantly in Groups A and B (P &lt; 0. 05). In Group C, spheric dioptres and retinal deviation decreased (P &lt; 0. 05), while cylindric and keratometric astigmatism did not change significantly (P &gt; 0. 05). In Group D, spheric dioptres, retinal deviation, and cylindric astigmatism decreased (P &lt; 0. 05).

40|$|We have {{previously}} applied three-dimensional acoustic, anisotropic, full-waveform inversion to a shallow-water, wide-angle, ocean-bottom-cable dataset {{to obtain a}} high-resolution velocity model. This velocity model produced: an improved match between synthetic and field data, better flattening of common-image gathers, a closer fit to well logs, and an improvement in the pre-stack depth- migrated image. Nevertheless, close examination reveals {{that there is a}} systematic mismatch between the observed and predicted data from this full-waveform inversion model, with the predicted data being consistently delayed in time. We demonstrate that this mismatch cannot be produced by systematic errors in the starting model, by errors in the assumed source wavelet, by incomplete convergence, or by the use of an insufficiently fine finite-difference mesh. Throughout these tests, the mismatch is remarkably robust with the significant exception that we do not see an analogous mismatch when inverting synthetic acoustic data. We suspect therefore that the mismatch arises because of inadequacies in the physics that are used during inversion. For ocean-bottom-cable data in shallow water at low frequency, apparent observed arrival times, in wide-angle turning-ray data, result from the characteristics of the detailed interference pattern between primary <b>refractions,</b> <b>surface</b> ghosts, and a large suite of wide-angle multiple reflected and/or multiple refracted arrivals. In these circumstances, the dynamics of individual arrivals can strongly influence the apparent arrival times of the resultant compound waveforms. In acoustic full-waveform inversion, we do not normally know the density of the seabed, and we do not properly account for finite shear velocity, finite attenuation, and fine-scale anisotropy variation, all of which can influence the relative amplitudes of different interfering arrivals, which in their turn influence the apparent kinematics. Here, we demonstrate that the introduction of a non-physical, offset-variable, water density during acoustic full-waveform inversion of this ocean- bottom-cable field dataset, can compensate efficiently and heuristically for these inaccuracies. This approach improves the travel-time match, and consequently increases both the accuracy and resolution of the final velocity model that is obtained using purely acoustic full-waveform inversion at minimal additional cost...|$|R

40|$|This {{commentary}} {{poses the}} fundamental {{question of whether the}} widespread implementation of diving wave refraction tomography in the near surface is addressing the right problems. It presents a thought provoking critique from an accuracy versus precision perspective. It represents an alternate description of the ongoing so-called model-driven versus data-driven conversation. The central proposition of this critique is that the current focus on misfit errors, which are a measure of the precision of the model parameters, are commonly, but erroneously, employed as a measure of the validity or the accuracy of the model. This fundamental error of science ignores the reality of non-uniqueness, which is the geophysicist’s “elephant in the room. ” The anecdotal evidence suggests that the widespread perception that diving wave refraction tomography is the panacea, the so-called “silver bullet,” has contributed to an alarming de-skilling of many practitioners of near <b>surface</b> <b>refraction</b> seismology. It has resulted in a plethora of low resolution tomograms which have done little to advance exploration or investigation and in turn, discovery in the near surface.

40|$|The {{dispersion}} {{property of}} periodic structures {{is a hot}} research topic in the last decade. By exploiting dispersion properties, one can manipulate the propagation of electromagnetic waves, and produce effects that do not exist in conventional materials. This thesis is devoted to two important dispersion effects: negative <b>refraction</b> and designed <b>surface</b> plasmons. First, we introduce negative <b>refraction</b> and designed <b>surface</b> plasmons, including a historical perspective, main areas for applications and current trends. Several numerical methods are implemented to analyze electromagnetic effects. We apply the layer-KKR method to calculate the electromagnetic wave through a slab of photonic crystals. By implementing the refraction matrix for semi-infinite photonic crystals, the layer-KKR method is modified to compute the coupling coefficient between plane waves and Bloch modes in photonic crystals. The plane wave method is applied to obtain the band structure and the equal-frequency contours in two-dimensional regular photonic crystals. The finite-difference time-domain method is widely used in our works, but we briefly discuss two calculation recipes in this thesis: {{how to deal with}} the surface termination of a perfect conductor and how to calculate the frequency response of high-Q cavities more efficiently using the Padè approximation method. We discuss a photonic crystal that exhibits negative refraction characterized by an effective negative index, and systematically analyze the coupling coefficients between plane waves in air and Bloch waves in the photonic crystal. We find and explain that the coupling coefficients are strong-angularly dependent. We first propose an open-cavity structure formed by a negative-refraction photonic crystal. To illuminate the physical mechanism of the subwavelength imaging, we analyze both intensity and phase spectrum of the transmission through a slab of photonic crystals with all-angle negative refraction. It is shown that the focusing properties of the photonic crystal slab are mainly due to the negative refraction effect, rather than the self-collimation effect. As to designed surface plasmons, we design a structured perfectly conducting surface to achieve the negative <b>refraction</b> of <b>surface</b> waves. By the average field method, we obtain the effective permittivity and permeability of a perfectly conducting surface drilled with one-dimensional periodic rectangle holes, and propose this structure as a designed surface plasmon waveguide. By the analogy between designed surface plasmons and surface plasmon polaritons, we show that two different resonances contribute to the enhanced transmission through a metallic film with an array of subwavelength holes, and explain that the shape effect is attributed to localized waveguide resonances.
