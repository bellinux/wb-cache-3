40|$|No clear {{consensus}} exists {{regarding the}} best material and technique {{for use in}} pediatric cranioplasty. The immature bone in pediatric patients poses several challenges, such as rapid growth, skull growth <b>restriction,</b> <b>plate</b> migration, and tissue erosion. We present a pediatric cranioplasty from the 1940 s, and examine {{the characteristics of the}} plating and anchoring used. The patient suffered a skull fracture after falling from a swing in 1946 at age six, requiring cranioplasty. Sixty-seven years later, she noted drainage from the old incision site, requiring reoperation. During surgery, the skull appeared normally shaped, and the area under the plate exhibited complete bone growth. The plate was noted to have several innovative design features that contributed to this outcome, notably that the plate and its anchors were “semi-rigid”; the hardware was softer than surrounding bone and easily pliable, deforming to accommodate skull growth and prevent restriction. The structure of the plate was also such that it allowed growth of underlying bone tissue to close the defect. This case contains unique features that can foster discussion regarding plate design and surgical technique that might avoid traditional complications...|$|E

Details {{presented}} {{cover the}} study of interfacial instability of a low density polyethylene melt flow in a coextrusion flow visualisation cell. The cell design splits a single melt feed into two meltstreams using a flow divider. The meltstreams are made to converge at an angle of 30 ° and flow into a common die land of 1. 0 mm height. The flows in the confluent region and die land to the die exit were observed through the side windows of the cell. The relative stream velocities, hence layer thickness ratio, of the two streams were varied using an adjustable <b>restriction</b> <b>plate</b> in the bottom channel. Stress and velocity fields were quantified using stress birefringence and particle image velocimetry techniques. Wave type interfacial instability was observed in the extrudate when the major/minor stream layer thickness ratio exceeded 2 : 1. Flow at immediate entry to the die land appeared stable when the extrudate exhibited instability. However, a disturbance was observed in the flow towards the exit of the die land. The frequency of the disturbance was quantified and {{found to be the}} same as that of the wave disturbance in the extrudate. A modified Leonov model and Flow 2000 software were used to simulate the melt flow through the geometry. A total normal stress difference (TNSD) sign criterion has been used to predict the presence of the wave interfacial instabilities in the coextrusion geometry...|$|E

40|$|Two low density {{polyethylene}} melts are studied using a coextrusion flow visualisation cell. The cell design enabled two melt streams to {{be observed}} at the confluent region and into the die land to the die exit. The melt streams converge at an angle of 30 ° and flow into a common die land of 1. 0 mm height. The relative stream velocities, hence layer thickness ratio, of the two streams was varied using a <b>restriction</b> <b>plate</b> {{in one of the}} streams. Stress and velocity fields are quantified using stress birefringence and particle image velocimetry techniques. Numerical simulation is conducted using flow history dependent viscoelastic stress calculation based on a modified Leonov model and Flow 2000 ™(tm) software. Simulated stress fields are compared to those experimentally. The simulated stress magnitudes were in good agreement with those determined experimentally. The simulation predicted a high local extensional stress in the minor flow stream just upstream of the entry to the die land. This local stress was also observed in the stress birefringence pattern. Extrudate instability was noted even when the stress field (birefringent pattern) in the convergent region {{and the beginning of the}} die land was stable. However, disturbances were noted in the birefringence and velocity fields near the exit of the die land when the major stream - minor stream layer thickness ratio was greater than 1. 5 : 1. Surface distortion appeared on the surface of the extrudate on the side of the minor flow stream when process conditions promoted instability. The recently proposed TNSD sign criterion has been used to predict the onset of the wave interfacial instabilities in the coextrusion geometry and good agreement with the experimental observation has been found...|$|E

All these cities restrain a percentage of vehicles every weekday during rush hours or for the entire day. When the restriction is based in two digits a theoretical 20% reduction of traffic is expected. Cities with serious air quality problems, such as México City and Santiago use more digits to achieve greater reductions in air pollution, and even the prohibition can be for more than one day a week.

40|$|Several conurbations in Latin America have {{implemented}} policies {{to restrict the}} use of private cars by prohibiting those with a license plate number ending on some digit, which vary each day, from circulating on that weekday. These policies have been formulated as a “second best” option to congestion charging as the latter policy has been deemed politically unfeasible so far. The idea underlying license <b>plate</b> <b>restrictions</b> is very simple: by not allowing a proportion {{of the total number}} of vehicles to circulate on a given day, congestion levels and other externalities are expected to decrease, improving the quality of life for people. Based on a simple microeconomic analysis, supported by a review of the literature and by evidence collected in several cities where these restrictions have been implemented, it is concluded that the policy is apparently effective only in the very short-term, but ultimately it fails to achieve its objectives and usually leads to a worse outcome...|$|R
50|$|The {{minimum age}} {{to obtain a}} {{restricted}} driver's license in the United States varies from 14 years, three months in South Dakota to as high as 17 in New Jersey. In most states, {{with the exception of}} South Dakota, a graduated licensing law applies to newly licensed teenage drivers, going by names such as Provisional Driver, Junior Operator, Probationary Driver, or Intermediate License. These licenses restrict certain driving privileges, such as whether the new driver may carry passengers and if so how many, as well as setting a curfew for young drivers to be off the roads. For example, Utah drivers who are under 18 may not drive other people outside the family in their first six months with a license. Unlike in some states of Australia and some provinces of Canada, however, graduated licensing laws do not require lowered speed limits, displaying of L and P <b>plates,</b> <b>restrictions</b> on towing a trailer or boat, or prohibitions on highway driving or operating high performance cars.|$|R

The unabridged version can be consulted, on request, at the University of Leicester’s David Wilson Library. This is a study of historical meanings in J. M. W. Turner’s art. As a starting point, it examines the cultural backdrop and mission of theorists of the Royal Academy, specifically Joshua Reynolds, to improve society. This mission, I argue, owes much to a strand of thinking particularly current at the time, aligned with the recently formed utopian concept of the bourgeois public: sentimentalism. Turner’s art, this thesis proposes, pursued this utopian ideal throughout. While landscape art around 1800 tended to be interpreted in contexts which abstracted art from societal significance, Turner’s earliest composite works already guided their audiences’ understanding towards the moral effects of tragedy through their paratexts. Apart from these works, exhibited in 1798 and 1799, whose paratexts have been studied in the past mostly for their enhancement of aesthetic effects, this thesis studies three more groups of Turner’s works: a second body are composite works from around 1800, some with appended texts supposedly written by the artist himself, which bear references to an artist-persona and artistic mission and therefore help single out Turner’s artistic mission. Another body of works are selected from the period when Turner’s Fallacies of Hope were in use. They particularly promote a pacifistic, anti-heroic ideal. The fourth group is defined by its subject matter, Venice. This thesis proposes that all of the groups, but particularly the last two, use paratexts as means to mingle an educational mission with sharp criticisms of reigning aesthetic and ethical approache...|$|R
40|$|A Cowdria ruminantium {{genomic library}} was {{constructed}} in a cosmid vector {{to serve as a}} source of easily accessible and pure C. ruminantium DNA for molecular genetic studies. The cosmid library contained 846 clones which were arrayed into microtitre <b>plates.</b> <b>Restriction</b> enzyme digestion patterns indicated that these clones had an average insert size of 35 kb. Probing of the arrays did not detect any bovine clones and only one of the known C. ruminantium genes, pCS 20, was detected. Due to the high AT content and the fact that C. ruminantium genes are active in the Escherichia coli host, the C. ruminantium clones were unstable in the SuperCos 1 vector and most clones did not grow reproducibly. The library was contaminated with E. coli clones and these clones were maintained with greater fidelity than the C. ruminantium clones, resulting in a skewed representation over time. We have isolated seven C. ruminantium clones which we were able to serially culture reproducibly; two of these clones overlap. These clones constitute the first large regions of C. ruminantium DNA to be cloned and represent almost 10 % of the C. ruminantium genome.

Examples of such policies have been the <b>plate</b> <b>restriction</b> mechanism imposed in Mexico City’s No Driving Today (Hoy no Circula) Program, which has actually increased air pollution and increased the hours worked by the huge taxi fleet to replace car trips (Davis 2007); the No Car Day (Dia sin Carro) in Bogota, which has resulted in a significant social loss for car users (Cantillo and Ortúzar 2011) and has not reduced pollution given the poor quality of public transport (Ide Carvallo and Lizana 2011); the Vehicle Restriction (Restriccion Vehicular) Program in Santiago, which reduced traffic by one-fifth of the expected effect (De Grange and Troncoso 2010); and the Estadual Rodizio Program in São Paulo, which increased the car fleet (Biezus and Oliveira Rocha 1999).

40|$|Cold-sensitive {{bacteriophage}} φX 174 mutants, another {{class of}} conditional lethals, were examined {{with regard to}} growth parameters, DNA synthesis, and particle properties. Two mutants, cs 70 and cs 82, were examined. Mutant cs 70 was eclipse defective, showing altered eclipse kinetics at permissive temperature (40 C) and failing entirely to eclipse at restrictive temperature (25 C). Mutant cs 70 replicated well at 25 C if allowed prior eclipse at 40 C. Mutant cs 82 had wild-type eclipse at both temperatures but was defective in single-strand synthesis at 25 C, which led to delayed progeny phage appearance, decreased progeny phage synthesis rate, and greatly reduced burst size. The cs 82 block could not be bypassed by temperature shift. Since complementation analysis of cs 70 and cs 82 was not feasible due to the unique properties of these mutants, those φX 174 properties affected by the virus coat were examined as an index of a mutation in a coat protein gene. Mutant cs 70 had aberrant attachment kinetics at both 25 C and 40 C, evidence of a coat protein alteration. Mutant cs 70 also exhibited significantly decreased thermal stability, further evidence of an altered virus structure.

The proposed law also mandates all government agencies to replace 10% of their auto fleets with plug-in electric vehicles; and public transportation and taxi services are mandated to slowly replace their fleets with electric vehicles, with a minimum of 10% of plug-in electric cars for new taxi cab medallions ("ecotaxis"). In addition, the law would provide income tax incentives for corporations that replace with plug-ins at least 10% of their fleets, with a minimum of three company cars.|$|R
40|$|Facial size {{reduction}} and facial retraction are key features that distinguish modern humans from archaic Homo. In order to more {{fully understand the}} emergence of modern human craniofacial form, {{it is necessary to}} understand the underlying evolutionary basis for these defining characteristics. Although it is well established that the cranial base exerts considerable influence on the evolutionary and ontogenetic development of facial form, less emphasis has been placed on developmental factors intrinsic to the facial skeleton proper. The present analysis was designed to assess anteroposterior facial reduction in a pig model and to examine the potential role that this dynamic has played in the evolution of modern human facial form. Ten female sibship cohorts, each consisting of three individuals, were allocated to one of three groups. In the experimental group (n = 10), microplates were affixed bilaterally across the zygomaticomaxillary and frontonasomaxillary sutures at 2 months of age. The sham group (n = 10) received only screw implantation and the controls (n = 10) underwent no surgery. Following 4 months of post-surgical growth, we assessed variation in facial form using linear measurements and principal components analysis of Procrustes scaled landmarks. There were no differences between the control and sham groups; however, the experimental group exhibited a highly significant reduction in facial projection and overall size. These changes were associated with significant differences in the infraorbital region of the experimental group including the presence of an infraorbital depression and an inferiorly and coronally oriented infraorbital plane in contrast to a flat, superiorly and sagittally infraorbital plane in the control and sham groups. These altered configurations are markedly similar to important additional facial features that differentiate modern humans from archaic Homo, and suggest that facial length <b>restriction</b> via rigid <b>plate</b> fixation is a potentially useful model to assess the developmental factors that underlie changing patterns in craniofacial form associated with the emergence of modern humans...|$|R
