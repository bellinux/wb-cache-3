It was a large, long and difficult production, filmed on location in the Sierra Nevada. The logistics were enormous—two entire towns were constructed, there were 5000 extras, 100 cooks, 2000 <b>rail</b> <b>layers,</b> a cavalry regiment, 800 Indians, 1300 buffaloes, 2000 horses, 10,000 cattle and 50,000 properties, including the original stagecoach used by Horace Greeley, Wild Bill Hickok's derringer pistol and replicas of the [...] "Jupiter" [...] and [...] "119" [...] locomotives that met at Promontory Point when the two ends of the line were joined on 10 May 1869.|$|R
40|$|Rail track {{undergoes}} complex loading patterns under {{moving traffic}} conditions compared to roads {{due to its}} continued and discontinued multi-layered structure, including <b>rail,</b> sleepers, ballast <b>layer,</b> sub-ballast layer, and subgrade. Particle size distributions (PSDs) of ballast, subballast, and subgrade layers can be critical in cyclic plastic deformation of rail track under moving traffic on frequent track degradation of rail tracks, especially at bridge transition zones. Conventional test approaches: static shear and cyclic single-point load tests are however unable to replicate actual loading patterns of moving train. Multi-ring shear apparatus; {{a new type of}} torsional simple shear apparatus, which can reproduce moving traffic conditions, was used in this study to investigate influence of particle size distribution of <b>rail</b> track <b>layers</b> on cyclic plastic deformation. Three particle size distributions, using glass beads were examined under different loading patterns: cyclic sin-gle-point load, and cyclic moving wheel load to evaluate cyclic plastic deformation of rail track under different loading methods. The results of these tests suggest that particle size distributions of <b>rail</b> track structural <b>layers</b> have significant impacts on cyclic plastic deformation under moving train load. Further, the limitations in con-ventional test methods used in laboratories to estimate the plastic deformation of rail track materials lead to underestimate the plastic deformation of rail tracks...|$|R

Experimental method is employed to study the heavy <b>rail</b> hardened <b>layer,</b> including surface hardness, micro-structure and cross-sectional hardness under different cooling time during quenching. Experimental results showed that obtained heavy rail after wind cooling quenching finally met the Tb/T 2344 - 2003 43 - 75 kg/m standard. Best quenching treatment condition is found and the defect is reduced to large extent when quenching time is 40 seconds, cooling time is 40 to 45 seconds, superior to the traditional spray cooling condition. These results provide an important reference for the quenching process of heavy rail...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A train-CRTS III {{slab track}} {{coupling}} dynamic model was proposed {{to study the}} dynamic performance of the system. Rail was modeled as space beam element. Both slab and HGT layer were modeled as plate element respectively. The vertical and lateral connections between <b>rail,</b> slab, HGT <b>layer,</b> and subgrade were modeled as spring-damper element. The vibration matrix equation of the system was established {{on the basis of}} the principle of the total potential energy with stationary value in elastic system dynamics and the rule of “set-in-right-position ” for formulating system matrices. The influence of mortar elastic modulus to CRTS III slab track vertical dynamic response was calculated when the train runs at 350 km/h. The results show that the larger of mortar elastic modulus, the faster the vibration between rail and slab decays, and the slower the vibration between slab and HGT layer decays...|$|R
2500|$|Over {{a million}} was {{originally}} budgeted {{to heat the}} third rail to prevent ice buildup, but later removed as a cost-cutting move. It was believed that the rapid operation (short headways) would keep the rail free of snow as the passing cars heated the rail. This proved not to work, and in operations at just the wrong conditions close to freezing the opposite occurred; when the train passed and heated the <b>rail,</b> microscopically thin <b>layers</b> of snow would be melted, and if the rail was below zero as a whole, the water would freeze to the rail and cause ice buildup. [...] Another retrofit was required to solve this problem, by adding wooden covers over the rail, a system used throughout Toronto's subway system. Even with these covers in place, the line can be shut down with any heavy snowfall that covers the fourth rail to a depth that fills {{the distance between the}} rail and the linear motor.|$|R

40|$|The wheel {{rail contact}} {{operates}} in an arduous environment. Damage {{to the surface of}} either component is possible during manufacture, installation, or operation. The question arises as to how tolerant is the railway wheel or section of track to surface indentation or damage. In this work a twin disc simulation has been used to relate the level of surface damage (as well as the way it is generated) to the fatigue life of the surfaces. A related problem is the presence of solid contamination on the track. Sand (applied for improved adhesion) or track ballast material can cause damage to the rail and wheel surfaces. These mechanisms have been explored to assess the effect on contact fatigue life and wear. The disc specimens have been either artificially damaged (with dents and scratches) or run with particles of sand or ballast material. The discs were then loaded and rotated at realistic conditions of contact pressure and controlled slip. For normal operation of the contact, either dry or with water lubrication, surface dents and scratches have little effect on fatigue life. The normal plastic flow in the <b>rail</b> surface <b>layer</b> acts to close up dents. The failure of the disc is then by fatigue cracking across the whole surface with no particular preference to the dent location. Alternatively, if the contact is lubricated with oil then this plastic flow is greatly reduced and the dents act as stress raisers and fatigue cracks initiate from their trailing edge. Sand or ballast particles are crushed as they enter the wheel/rail contact. The fragments indent the surfaces and rapidly roughen the contact faces. The surface indentation is relatively minor, but the presence of particles increases the level of traction (over the wet case) and promotes further surface plastic flow. This can reduce the residual fatigue life of the contact. Further, high concentrations of sand were shown to promote a low cycle fatigue process that caused very high wear by the spallation of material. The twin disc simulations have shown that, under conditions similar to that of wheel/rail operation, surface damage is not a primary cause of fatigue failure. However, wear is greatly accelerated by the presence of solid contaminants and some evidence of a low cycle fatigue process was observed for sanded contacts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{estimate}} the temperature {{distribution in the}} rails of an electromagnetic rail gun (EMG) due to the confinement of the current in a narrow surface layer resulting from the skin effect. In order to obtain analytic results, we assume a simple geometry for the rails, an electromagnetic skin effect boundary edge that propagates with the accelerating armature, and a current carrying channel controlled by magnetic field diffusion into the rails. We compute the temperature distribution in the rails {{at the time that}} the armature leaves the rails. For the range of exit velocities, from 1500 m/s to 5000 m/s, we find the highest temperatures are near the gun breech. After a single gun firing, the temperature reaches the melting temperature of the metal <b>rails</b> in a <b>layer</b> of finite thickness near the surface of the rails, for rails made of copper or tantalum. We plot the thickness of the melt layer as a function of position along the rails. In all cases, the thickness of the melt layer increases with gun velocity, making damage to the gun rails more likely at higher velocity. We also calculate the efficiency of the EMG as a function of gun velocity and find that the efficiency increases with increasing velocity, but only if the length of the gun is sufficiently long. The thickness of the melted layer also decreases with increasing rail length. Therefore, there is a tradeoff: for rails of sufficient length, the gun efficiency increases with increasing velocity but the melted layer thickness in the rails also increases. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to better {{understand}} the factors that affect melt-wear in the armature-to-rail contact interface of an electromagnetic launcher (EML). In order to investigate the factors, the study uses finite element analysis (FEA) to vary parameters of a lab-scale EML at the Georgia Institute of Technology. FEA is used due to the complex nature of the system, which includes the geometry and various engineering aspects that the EML incorporates. The study focuses on an uncoupled analysis of the structural, electromagnetic (EMAG), thermal, and modal aspects. The reason for the uncoupled analysis was because the system was complex and there were computational limits. Also, by uncoupling the analysis fields, the way the parameters affected melt-wear could be viewed separately. The study varied the geometry of the armature, the stiffness of the <b>rail</b> system (compliance <b>layer),</b> and the material of the armature. The structural analysis was for the initial contact of the rail to the armature and found the von Mises stresses, contact area, and contact pressure. The EMAG analysis found the Lorentz forces in the system based on a current curve used in the lab-scale EML. The thermal analysis consisted of friction heating and Joule heating. The modal analysis was for the unstressed and pre-stressed armature. Based on the study conducted, it was found that aluminum would provide the best speeds due to its lighter mass, but lacked in the thermal resistance area. Tungsten provided the better thermal resistance, but lacked in the potential speed due to its heavier mass. M. S.

40|$|A {{state-of-the-art}} {{study on}} ground-borne vibration induced by railway turnouts (switches & crossings) is presented. Vibration generating mechanisms and possibilities for cost-effective mitigation measures are discussed. A brief literature survey {{and examples of}} results from vibration measurements performed by the Schweizerische Bundesbahnen (SBB) are presented. The present work was performed within the EU FP 7 project RIVAS (Railway Induced Vibration Abatement Solutions). Mitigation measures for turnouts described in the literature mainly aim at reducing the dynamic wheel-rail contact force (impact load) in the crossing panel. This is supported by field observations of amplified ground-borne vibration at turnouts, indicating {{that there is a}} need to improve the design of these track components. A smooth wheel transition between wing rail and crossing nose is important to achieve low energy impacts on the crossing. Measures to mitigate the vibrations include the use of soft or stiff Under Sleeper Pads (USP) for better and more stable turnout geometry over time. The use of USP may also reduce the magnitude of vibrations transferred from turnout to soil. Other measures include improving the design of the crossing panel (material and geometry of crossing nose and wing rails) and the use of more resilient rail pads. Results from a Swiss test campaign at two different sites (Rubigen and Le Landeron), using stiff USP in four turnouts, are presented and compared to results from four nominal turnouts without USP. However, the vibrations measured at Le Landeron, and even more so for Rubigen, seem to be significantly influenced by the turnout and soil conditions. It is important to accurately determine the condition of each turnout to enable a meaningful comparison between the turnouts and to draw conclusions on the influence of turnout mitigation measures on vibration emission. The best approach to reduce the amplification of vibration is a system approach where different parameters (such as rail profiles, <b>rail</b> material, resilient <b>layers)</b> are designed to interact in a harmonious and robust way. It is thus important to identify the combination of parameters that defines the design of an optimum turnout. Modelling is required to optimize the wheel transition over the crossing panel. Further tests are needed to define the relevant geometric parameters influencing the wheel trajectory and the amplified vibrations. If an improvement of the dynamic wheel-rail interaction (wheel transition) can be accomplished that reduces impact loads on the crossing panel, both vibration magnitudes and the need for crossing panel maintenance can be reduced...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors give a {{solution}} to the problem of the impact of a rolling stock on the rail track on the basis of modeling a railway track as a multi-layered space, introducing each of the layers is a quasi-elastic orthotropic layer with cylindrical anisotropy in the polar coordinate system. The article describes wave equations, taking into account the rotational inertia of cross sectional and transverse shear strains. From the point of view of classical structural mechanics train path can be represented as a multilayer system comprising separate layers with different stiffness, lying on the foundation being the elastic-isotropic space. Winkler model provides that the basis is linearly deformable space, there are loads influencing its surface. These loads are transferred through a layered deformable half-space. This representation is used in this study as an initial approximation. For more accurate results of the deformation of a railway track because of rolling dynamic loads it is proposed to present a railway track in the form of a layered structure, where each element (assembled rails and sleepers, ballast section, the soil in the embankment, basement soils) is modeled as a planar quasi-elastic orthotropic layer with cylindrical anisotropy. The equations describing the dynamic behaviour of flat element in a polar coordinate system are hyperbolic in nature and take into account the rotational inertia of the cross sectional and the transverse shear strains. This allows identifying the impact on the final characteristics of the blade wave effects, and oscillatory processes. In order to determine the unknown functions included in the constitutive equations it is proposed to use decomposition in power series in spatial coordinate and time. In order to determine the coefficients of ray series for the required functions, it is necessary to differentiate the defining wave equations k times on time, to take their difference on the different sides of the wave surface, and apply the consistency condition for the transition from the jump of the derivative of a function in the coordinate to the jump of the derivative of a sought function in time of higher order. The proposed approach allows considering the whole structure of the railway track in the form of a set of layers, making for each <b>layer</b> (<b>rail</b> - sleeper; sleeper - ballast; ballast - ballast bed) a system of equations and solving them. Therefore it is possible to vary the characteristics of different layers and their modules of elasticity, determining the optimal thickness of the ballast layer or oversleeper and undersleeper strips...|$|R
