50|$|The final form {{consists}} of a 1-to-1.8-metre-thick, reinforced-concrete cylinder (the core), varying from 12 to 18 metres in diameter, encircled with radiating networks of cantilevered steel beams on each floor of its building modules. The modules themselves are composed of steel columns, metal decking, concrete slabs, and outer tension and compression <b>ring</b> <b>beams,</b> which support glass-paneled outer walls. The bottom of each module is covered with glass fiber reinforced concrete. Beams, as well as steel struts tying all the structural components together, are bolted through the concrete core and hence are anchored into place, transferring vertical loads from perimeter columns and <b>ring</b> <b>beams</b> to the core.|$|R

[...] The building is supported by 16boomerang-shaped concrete trusses which are held together by two ring beams, one at the bends of the trusses and the other at their tops.

2500|$|Just after 1 p.m on February 17, 2014, {{one week}} after {{demolition}} of the stadium bowl had begun, demolition crews were working on taking down the concrete <b>ring</b> <b>beam</b> that encircled to top of the Metrodome, when {{a portion of the}} <b>ring</b> <b>beam</b> collapsed out of sequence, bringing an immediate halt to the work. No one was hurt and no equipment was damaged by the collapse. After five days of investigation from structural and demolition experts, it was decided that the remaining portion of the concrete <b>ring</b> <b>beam</b> would be destroyed using controlled explosive charges—virtually the same method that was used to bring down the Metrodome's steel support cables for the roof. This second controlled explosion was a continued deviation from the original plan to not use explosives to destroy the stadium. However, it was determined that this was the safest way to bring down the remaining <b>ring</b> <b>beam</b> structure. On February 23, 2014, just after 7:30a.m., with 84 explosive charges of dynamite, set in 24 columns of the upper concourse of the stadium, the remaining <b>ring</b> <b>beam</b> and corners of the Metrodome were brought down in 11 seconds. Once the concrete <b>ring</b> <b>beam</b> was brought down successfully, this enabled demolition crews to continue with the original wrecking ball demolition method that was originally chosen (though the order in which the sections would be brought down were changed {{as a result of the}} <b>ring</b> <b>beam</b> implosion), to bring down what was left of the Metrodome. Despite this unexpected setback, Mortenson Construction said that the demolition of the Metrodome and construction of U.S. Bank Stadium were both still on schedule.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is devoted to}} investigate the behavior and performance of reinforced concrete horizontally curved <b>ring</b> <b>beams</b> with and without openings, unstrengthened and strengthened (externally by CFRP laminates or internally by steel reinforcement). The experimental work consisted of fabrication and testing of four reinforced concrete <b>ring</b> <b>beams.</b> The experimental variables considered in the test program included: presence of opening in the beam, internal strengthening of the beam at the opening by reinforcing steel (stirrups) and external strengthening (confinement) by CFRP laminates for openings. The beams were tested under the action of four point loading at the top face of midspans with four supports at the bottom face of the beams. The ANSYS software was used to analyze by finite element method (FEM) both experimental specimens and theoretical ones, including the study of size and type of the openings. The {{results show that the}} presence of openings has a great effect on the behavior and ultimate load capacity of <b>ring</b> <b>beams,</b> while the strengthening of these opening by internal steel reinforcement or external CFRP laminates will increase the ultimate load capacity and affect post-cracking behavior and mode of failure of these beams. The load midspan deflection and twisting curves are shown. A comparison between experimental and theoretical results is also shown. The results computed by FEM analysis and modeling gave good agreement with experimental results...|$|R

2500|$|With the {{approval}} of the new Vikings stadium at the Dome site by the Minnesota legislature, the fate of the Metrodome was sealed. The Vikings played their final game at the Metrodome on December 29, 2013, beating the Detroit Lions 14-13. The following day, a local company began removal of seats for sale to the public and various charities and nonprofits. Individual chairs went for $40/each to charities, $60/each to the public, and $80 apiece for specific seat requests. [...] The roof was deflated for the final time on January 18, starting at 7:15a.m. The process took about 35 minutes. After the deflation, demolition crews began cutting out individual panels of the teflon roof that would continue all the way up until the morning that the roof cables were severed, and no more than a week after the deflation, the entire loading dock section of the Metrodome was demolished. Much like the first few early phases of demolition, it was decided that the Metrodome would be torn down via wrecking ball, rather than implosion—due to the concern that vibration and dust from an implosion would have on nearby downtown Minneapolis neighborhoods and Hennepin County Medical Center, which sat catacorner from the now-demolished Metrodome. The original demolition plan called for the Metrodome to be torn down section by section in a counter-clockwise motion (starting with the northeast corner of the stadium) as the exterior of the new stadium was built adjacent to and around the continuously-diminishing structure of the Metrodome, as this animation shows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDnJsZJsH-M However, when part of the concrete <b>ring</b> <b>beam</b> collapsed out-of-sequence during demolition on February 17 (additional information below), the order in which the sections were actually torn down was completely changed and rather disorganized. Nevertheless, all sections were successfully and eventually taken down and no setbacks in the demolition process occurred {{as a result of the}} <b>ring</b> <b>beam</b> collapse.|$|E

The hanging cables rise ten meters to the top from the saddle point and the bracing cables fall four meters to the valley of the <b>ring</b> <b>beam.</b> The building is 14 meters (46 ft) tall, from the event floor to the pinnacle of the roof. The <b>ring</b> <b>beam</b> is supported by forty circular columns and four stiff pylons, all visible in the arenas facade. The pylons consist of radially oriented concrete walls, with a length of 3.5 meters (11.5 ft), which stores ventilation equipment. The video board, lights, and sound system is suspended in a radially oriented cable system anchored in the four pylons. It was not consider stable enough for colour telecasting to attach these components directly to the roof. The cable system also serves as tension rods for the <b>ring</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|E
