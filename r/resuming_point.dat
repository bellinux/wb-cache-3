'I mean to question this stable-boy of yours; {{and if you are}} so certain of his innocence, you can afford to let him answer for himself.

40|$|Three {{squirrel}} monkeys, {{trained to}} make a requesting gesture, were tested {{in the presence of}} a human assistant whose visual attention varied across trials. When food was available in one dish and an empty dish was nearby, the monkeys pointed overwhelmingly toward the former, regardless of where the assistant was looking. Looking at the assistant while pointing ("monitoring") peaked when she looked at them and when she attempted to engage them in joint attention. When only one dish was present, the monkeys refrained from gesturing if it was empty and if no assistant was present. They gestured more when the assistant made eye contact with them. Furthermore, when the assistant's focus of attention switched from the dish or the ceiling to the monkeys, the latter <b>resumed</b> <b>pointing</b> and increased their monitoring of the assistant. This is the first demonstration of such flexible use of an intentionally communicative requesting gesture in New World monkeys...|$|R

5000|$|For knockouts, a ten-count {{similar to}} boxing and kickboxing is used. If the {{participant}} {{is unable to}} answer the ten-count, it is declared a TKO and that fighter has lost the match.

6000|$|He looked, not irritated only, but {{surprised}} as well, at finding his parlor-maid {{waiting for him}} in the drawing-room, and inquired, sharply and suspiciously, what she wanted there? Magdalen replied that she had come there to answer the bell. His face cleared a little when he heard the explanation. [...] "Yes, yes; to be sure," [...] he said. [...] "I did ring, and then I forgot it." [...] He pulled the sliding door back into its place as he spoke. [...] "Coals," [...] he <b>resumed,</b> impatiently, <b>pointing</b> to the empty scuttle.

6000|$|The song (many times {{interrupted}} by flitting thoughts which took {{the place of}} several bars, and <b>resumed</b> at a <b>point</b> it would have reached had its continuity been unbroken) now received a more palpable check, {{in the shape of}} [...] "Ho-i-i-i-i-i!"

50|$|The freezer feature {{allowed to}} save the memory {{contents}} to disk to be <b>resumed</b> at later <b>point</b> (this allowed for convenient copying of single-load games, for example). It also allowed the use of some rudimentary game cheating functionality (disabling sprite collision detection, for example), and printing {{a copy of the}} screen image to the printer. The freezer also allowed access to the machine-language monitor.|$|R
60|$|Hilbrook had {{stiffened}} {{more and}} more, {{as he went}} on, {{in the sort of}} defiance he had put on when he first began to speak of himself, {{and at the end of}} his confidence Ewbert did not venture any comment.

50|$|In {{computer}} programming, {{a return}} statement causes execution {{to leave the}} current subroutine and <b>resume</b> at the <b>point</b> in the code immediately after where the subroutine was called, known as its return address.

Jewish and Christian Futurists, Dispensationalists, and, to some degree, Partial Preterists believe that the prophecies of Daniel stopped with the destruction of the Second Temple of Jerusalem; but will <b>resume</b> at some <b>point</b> in the future after a gap in prophecy that accounts for the Church Age.|$|R

40|$|<b>Resumé</b> The {{starting}} <b>point</b> {{for this}} project has been a phenomenological research of how girls experience being girls at the gender-segregated boarding school, Woldingham School. We have investigated this through qualitative research interviews with three students from the school. We have used Steinar Kvale and Svend Brinkmann who formulate a method of how to conduct phenomenological interviews and thereby gain insight into the informants' life-world. In addition, we have used Harriet Bjerrum Nielsen, Monica Rudberg and Judith Butler as theoretical references in our analysis...|$|R

Who would not pay triple this sum for another day's association with such a domestic circle? I will not conceal from you that the document ends with certain legal phrases about the unpleasant things that may happen if the money is not paid; but meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, let me assure you that I am comfortably off here for accommodation, wine and cigars, and bid you for the present a sportsman-like welcome to the luxuries of the Paradise of Thieves." ...|$|R
