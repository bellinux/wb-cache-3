40|$|If someone lends {{money to}} another person, he trusts {{that he will}} get his money back. Particularly {{in the context of}} {{commercial}} relationships, {{there is a need for}} more security. Such security can be achieved by a so-called security right on someone’s property. If the debtor does not pay back the borrowed money, the secured creditor can use his security right to sell the property. From the proceeds, he may recover his claim. The most common example of such a security right is the mortgage on a house. Another security right is the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>pledge.</b> Movable goods and claims can be pledged. In former days, a good could only be pledged if the good was actually handed over to the creditor. If the debtor did pay his loan, he got his property back. One could think of the pawnshop. Since 1992, the Dutch Civil Code offers the possibility to pledge a good, while the debtor stays in possession. This means that the debtor can then continue to use the good, for example if the pledged good is a machine that is necessary for the business operations of the debtor. This PhD thesis analyzes the consequences such invisible security right leads to. Imagine the situation that a third person buys the pledged good from the debtor. Or that a third party gives a loan to the debtor because he thinks that there are enough means of recovery against the debtor’s property. Should there be stricter requirements for invisible security rights? Is the insolvency administrator obliged to give the pledged machine, which is necessary for the business operations, back to the creditor? These and other questions are answered in the PhD thesis. Additionally, solutions are developed to address the arising problems...|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the development of the Dutch silent pledge on claims, which was introduced by legislation after the fiducia became prohibited. Financial institutions were of the opinion that the prohibition on the fiducia would limit the provision of credit and have negative economic consequences. The legislature was of the opinion that with the silent pledge the provision of credit could continue as a matter of course. This contribution traces the development of the silent pledge since then. It starts with a discussion of the introduction of the “silent cession” as a means of security, and then moves to the silent pledge. In terms of the Dutch civil code, a pledge can be created by means of an authentic or registered private deed without the knowledge of the debtor. The purpose of the authentic or registered deed is to ensure that a fixed date can be ascribed to the pledge to be able to determine the rank of the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> in relation to the rights of third parties. Registration, however, does not mean registration in a public register – it is a silent pledge since no publicity is given to this encumbrance of assets. The author discusses the different aspects concerning the silent pledge: the pledge of future debts, a shortened registration period, the meaning of adequate definiteness in the deed, collective pledge deeds, and the collection and redress of the pledged debt. The issue of netting also comes to the fore. It is concluded that the banks have, by means of clever litigation, ensured that the silent pledge is used to their benefit. The silent pledge is currently functioning as a kind of generally applicable right of security. The flipside of the coin is that, in practice, almost every single susceptible asset is subject to a silent pledge, which means that at the insolvency of a debtor, after all the pledgees’claims are dealt with, there is almost nothing left for the concurrent creditors. As a result of the voracity of these very hungry caterpillars, there is nothing left in the insolvent estate. It is becoming clear that the position of the normal creditors in relation to the banks needs to be improved and strengthened...|$|E

The thesis is structured as follows: introduction, three main chapters which constitute the body of the thesis, and conclusion.

It further introduces the parties to a relationship established by a pledge and the institute <b>of</b> future <b>pledge</b> together with its practical applications.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} law <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> as {{presented}} in the early Irish laws and draws connections to its relations within the overall system of security. At the centre of my research stands the question what pledges Irish law recognised and how their application was determined, so as to provide a paradigm for the law <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> in its entirety. A pledge is usually a movable, material object of symbolic and economic worth that is given to another person as a security deposit for an outstanding obligation. The main findings of this thesis are a first paradigm of the law <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> and a methodological and contextual categorisation of all types <b>of</b> <b>pledges</b> that opens doors for future research into property law. The combined discussion <b>of</b> <b>pledges,</b> hostages and sureties offers the reader insight into a triple method of security and its differences. Moreover, the close relationship between given pledges and distrained pledges is unravelled for the first time. Of further note is the comparative investigation into pledging. Therein, the reader is presented with how pledges are used in Welsh, Salic, Lombard, Visigothic, and Burgundian law. The objective is to offer the reader a view into the possibilities <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> {{and to provide a}} framework against which the Irish evidence can be probed, which reveals how sophisticated and attentive to detail the Irish laws were.
