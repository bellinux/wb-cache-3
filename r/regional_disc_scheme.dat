40|$|INTRODUCTION: Parallel imaging {{techniques}} like SENSE or GRAPPA are used routinely in clinical practice today and offer robust acceleration {{factors in the}} range of R= 2 to R= 4. The acceleration comes at the expense of local noise amplification, known as g-factor noise, which depends on the coil geometry and the undersampling pattern. Several methods have been proposed to calculate g-factor maps for visualizing the strength of the local noise amplification [1]. Recently, novel iterative reconstruction techniques have been presented that promise high acceleration factors by sampling k-space incoherently, e. g. using Poisson <b>disc</b> <b>schemes,</b> and exploiting sparse representations of the object [2].

Encrypted query results are returned to the TU, where they are decrypted using the key provided by the DO and then false positives are filtered to obtain the actual query results.

40|$|Abstract. The Subset Difference (SD) {{method is}} the most popular of Broadcast Encryption schemes due to its use in AACS {{standard}} for video <b>discs.</b> The <b>scheme</b> assumes the number of users n to be a power of two. In this paper, we relax this and consider arbitrary values of n. In some applications, this leads to substantial savings in the transmission overhead. Our analysis consists of the following aspects: (1) A recurrence to count N(n, r, h) - the number of revocation patterns for arbitrary values of n and r (number of revoked users) resulting in a header length of h. The recurrence allows us to generate data and hence to completely analyze it for larger n than the brute force method. (2) We do a probabilistic analysis of the subset cover finding algorithm of the SD method and find an expression to evaluate the expected header length E[Xn,r] for arbitrary values of n and r. Using this, E[Xn,r] can be evaluated in O(r log n) time using constant space.

40|$|The {{association}} between age-related vertebral fractures (VFx) and disc degeneration (DD) is not clear, despite the high prevalence of both conditions. Load {{is transferred to}} the vertebra by the adjacent intervertebral discs, and degenerative changes within the disc alter how the net force is distributed over the interface between vertebra and disc, known as the vertebral endplate (EP). The ability of the vertebra to resist fracture depends {{not only on the}} magnitude of the net force, but also on the distribution. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the ability of the vertebra to withstand the distribution of applied force depends on the spatial distribution of bone mineral density (BMD) within the vertebra. First, the strength and stiffness of a region of bone in the vertebra are highly correlated with the BMD of that region. Second, changes in the spatial distribution of regional BMD have been associated with aging and DD. Thirdly, some of these observed changes have been replicated in computer models bone adaption with in the presence of progressive DD, suggesting that bone adaption is occurring in response to the altered force distribution associated with DD, and that maladaptation could elevate the risk of fracture. Notably, the current clinical method of identifying patients at risk of fracture is to use an average measure of BMD for the entire vertebra. The lack of consideration of the spatial distribution of BMD may explain why the clinical method used at present does not adequately identify those at risk of fracture. The possible relationship among spatial distribution of BMD, DD, force distribution across the endplate, and vertebral strength suggests that characterizing the spatial distribution of BMD within a vertebra could add to the understanding of why some vertebra are more likely to fracture. This project sought to determine if an association exists between the spatial distribution of vertebral BMD and disc health in order to provide an improved perspective of the clinical sequelae of DD and to improve the ability of clinicians to identify those who would benefit most from intervention. This study found evidence that the distribution of bone in the vertebral body and EP depend on the health of the adjacent disc. The distribution of pressure in discs favors the anterior most portion of the disc in anteriorly flexed postures and the density in the anterior most portion of the EP appears to respond to this shift, suggesting that bone is adapting to loading patterns associated with certain postures more than others. This study also found {{association between}} reduced <b>regional</b> <b>disc</b> height and altered distribution of trabecular density which was positive in the nuclear region and negative in the annular region. In some cases {{there was a lack of}} association between disc height and density distribution that may indicate maladaptation and thus increased risk of fracture. This study, being cross-sectional could not identify whether the observed alterations in density and degeneration initiated in the vertebra or the disc. However, this study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the distribution of vertebral density and the functional properties of the adjacent disc that may ultimately improve the clinician's ability to predict VFx. 2017 - 06 - 21 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R

30|$|Data owners {{with large}} volumes of data can {{outsource}} spatial databases {{by taking advantage of}} the cost-effective cloud computing model with attractive on-demand features such as scalability and high computing power. Data confidentiality in outsourced databases is a key requirement and therefore, untrusted third-party service providers in the cloud should not be able to view or manipulate the data. This paper proposes DISC (Dynamic Index for Spatial data on the Cloud), a secure retrieval scheme to answer range queries over encrypted databases at the Cloud Service Provider. The dynamic spatial index is also able to support dynamic updates on the outsourced data at the cloud server. To be able to support secure query processing and updates on the Cloud, spatial transformation is applied to the data and the spatial index is encrypted using Order-Preserving Encryption. With transformation and cryptography techniques, DISC achieves a balance between efficient query execution and data confidentiality in a cloud environment. Additionally, a more secure <b>scheme,</b> <b>DISC</b> ∗, is proposed to balance the trade-off between query results returned and security provided. The security analysis section studies the various attacks handled by DISC. The experimental study demonstrates that the proposed scheme achieves a lower communication cost in comparison to existing cloud retrieval schemes.|$|R
40|$|Purpose Regenerative repair is a {{promising}} new approach in treating damaged intervertebral <b>discs.</b> An experimental <b>scheme</b> was established for autologous and/or allogenic repair after massive disc injury. Methods Disc healing was promoted in 11 animals by injecting in vitro expanded autologous/homologous disc cells 2 weeks after stab injury of lumbar discs L 1 - 2. The following control discs {{were used in}} our sheep injury model: L 2 - 3, vehicle only; L 3 - 4, injury only; L 4 - 5, undamaged; and lumbar discs from four non-experimental animals. Disc cells were suspended in a biologically supportive albumin/hyaluronan two-component hydrogel solution that polymerizes when inserted in order to anchor cells at the injection site.

40|$|Morphological and {{clinical}} signs of lumbar intervertebral disc disruption are {{pronounced in the}} posterior and postero-lateral inner annulus fibrosus. The <b>regional</b> intervertebral <b>disc</b> predisposition to disruption suggests that intradiscal stresses and strains may also be region specific and possibly initiate the disruption. Quantitative data describing intradiscal deformations have been limited to the mid-sagittal plane using techniques that compromise the intervertebral disc integrity. No experimental study has quantified intradiscal strain patterns. The initial objectives of the present work were to use experimental cadaveric methods and finite element techniques to develop and validate methods of measuring intradiscal deformations and strains along the complete mid-transversal plane using a fine wire grid. Subsequently, these methods were used to quantify intradiscal deformations and strains in healthy and degenerated intervertebral discs during sub-maximal loads. Eighteen healthy and degenerated intervertebral discs were subjected with wires placed within and beads glued along their mid-traversal plane surface, to compression, extension, flexion and lateral bending. Cramo-caudal radiographs at unloaded and loaded steps documented wire and bead positions. Intradiscal nucleus pulposus displacements, circumferential, radial and shear strains in the annulus fibrosus and transitional zone under load were compared among all anatomical regions and between healthy and degenerated intervertebral discs. The methods develop to estimate intradiscal strains from intradiscal wire intersection displacements demonstrated a relative overall accuracy of 2. 9 % (i. e. percent error from theoretical estimations). Generally, intradiscal circumferential and radial strains decreased from the transitional zone to the annulus fibrosus and increased {{at the side of}} bending during all bending conditions. Circumferential and radial strain peaks were observed in the postero-lateral regions even in healthy intervertebral discs during extension and lateral bending. Shear strains were generally uniform within the healthy intervertebral disc. Degeneration significantly increased intradiscal circumferential, radial and shear strains during all bending conditions (particularly in the postero-lateral regions). The increased nucleus pulposus migration in degenerative intervertebral discs appeared to have caused the increases in circumferential and radial strains and to some extent perhaps increases in shears strains. The inner postero-lateral annulus fibrosus is predisposed to excessive normal circumferential and radial strains early on which coincide with morphological changes observed in the same regions. This observation suggests a predisposition to failure likely due to an inability of resisting delaminating normal strains. Furthermore, the increased nucleus pulposus migration observed in degenerated intervertebral discs appears to shift the pivot point during bending movements more posterior, which consequently forces the postero-lateral regions to consistently experience higher circumferential and radial strains. These effects may contribute to the segmental instability observed in degenerated motion segments prior to intervertebral disc failure...|$|R
