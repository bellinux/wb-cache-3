One of SLAC’s accelerator facilities is B-Factory, whose PEP-II accelerator ring has been operating since 1997 and is being upgraded to higher luminosity operation. Four radiological issues associated with high luminosity operation up to CY 2008 are re-evaluated: 1) annual doses in IR halls, 2) annual skyshine doses at site boundaries, 3) potential radioactive air releases, and 4) potential groundwater activation. This paper presents the skyshine doses and air emission doses to the Maximally Exposed Individual (MEI) at SLAC site boundaries. The normal beam loss scenarios around PEP-II ring are presented first. In CY 2008, the luminosity is 2 x 10 34 cm- 2 s- 1, and the stored current is 4. 0 -A for low-energy ring (LER) and 2. 2 -A for high-energy ring (HER). The beam losses around PEP-II ring include those near injection region in IR 10 and IR 8 and those at collimators (e. g., HER collimators in IR 12, LER collimators in IR 4 and IR 6). The beam losses in IR 8 and IR 10 (where injection into ring occurs) are further divided into septum, BAD (beam abort dump) and TD (tune-up dump), as well as apertures.

25|$|A common unit of {{exposure}} of lung tissue to alpha emitters is the {{working level month}} (WLM), {{this is where the}} human lungs have been exposed for 170 hours (a typical month worth of work for a miner) to air which has 3.7 kBq of 222Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products).

It is estimated that the average person (general public) is subject to 0.2 WLM per year, which works out at about 15 to 20 WLM in a lifetime. According to the NRC 1 WLM is a 5 to 10 mSv lung dose (0.5 to 1.0 rem), while the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) consider that 1 WLM is equal to a lung dose of 5.5 mSv, the International Commission on <b>Radiological</b> <b>Protection</b> (ICRP) consider 1 WLM to be a 5 mSv lung dose for professional workers (and 4 mSv lung dose for the general public).

40|$|Objective: To {{present the}} {{preliminary}} {{results of a}} feasibility study performed to determine {{the value of a}} mobile interventional radiology unit used to promote a uterine embolization program for low-income patients. Methods: Forty patients with symptomatic fibroids were treated with uterine embolization. Procedures were performed in four public hospitals in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo. This study was approved by the institutional research ethics committee and all patients signed an informed consent form. A mobile interventional radiology unit, named ANGIOMOVEL, was conceived and implemented utilizing a small truck to transport one mobile C arm, one <b>radiological</b> table, <b>protection</b> aprons and a small trolley containing specific supplies for the procedures. The ANGIOMOVEL team consisted of two interventional radiologists, one nurse, one driver and one assistant. The unit visited one hospital per week during a three-month period. Patient inclusion was contingent upon several factors, such as evaluation by a trained gynecologist, completion of a pelvic MRI, routine serological laboratory tests and completion of a quality of life questionnaire (QOL). Outcomes, MRI and QOL were evaluated. Data obtained after 12 weeks were collected and analyzed. Results: Technical success was achieved in 100 % of cases, with a mean procedure time of 43 minutes and a mean fluoroscopic time of 24 minutes. The mean hospital stay was 1. 07 day and the mean time for recovery and return to normal activities was 10 days. After 12 weeks, 36 (90 %) of patients noticed improvement of their symptoms and 4 (10 %) did not notice any improvement. Thirty-eight patients (95 %) were satisfied or very satisfied and 39 (97. 5 %) said they would recommend the procedure. Pre- and post-procedure magnetic resonance imaging analysis showed that complete fibroid ischemia was achieved in 92. 5 % of cases with a mean uterine volume reduction of 38 % and a mean fibroid volume reduction of 52 %. Health-related quality of life scores showed improvement, increasing from 39. 30 before the treatment to 79. 62 points after therapy. Conclusions: The initial results indicate that using a Mobile Interventional Radiology Unit is feasible, efficient and safe to develop a successful uterine fibroid embolization program providing care to the underserved patient community...|$|R
40|$|Abstract More than 100 {{years have}} passed since {{physicist}} W. C. Röntgen discovered X rays and their use in medicine. Knowledge about their harmful effects led to gradual im-plementing of protection rules. Attention of experts gradually focused on persons exa-mined or treated by ionizing radiation, as so-called medical exposition represents {{the most important part of}} person´s irradiation from artificial sources of radiation at all. De-finition of medical irradiation was accepted by Act No. 18 / 1997 Coll. (Atomic Act) and extended in novel of the Act (No. 13 / 2002 Coll.). Medical irradiation is not limited but two principles of radiation protection govern [...] principle of reasoning and principle of optimalization. I focused my attention on radiation load of patients during selective coronaro-graphy which still remains gold diagnostic standard for coronary arteries examination. I measured and evaluated the radiation dose of patients at two angiography machines in Teaching Hospital in Motol. They are angiography machines PHILIPS Integris Allura (made in 2002) at Institution of Imaging Methods and PHILIPS Integris HM 3000 (ma-de in 1993) at Cardiovascular Centre for Adults. Some technical parameters of these machines differ, e. g. the size of image amplifier. Since 2003 to 2007 10, 087 patients at Cardiovascular Centre for Adults and 7, 760 patients at Institution of Imaging Methods were examined by selective coronarography. I analyse all equipment of angiography work place, including technical of X-ray angiomachine, <b>radiological</b> standards, <b>protection</b> against radiation, requirements for imaging system, parameters impacting the quality of X-ray image, possibilities of lowering radiation load in patients. Hypothesis is based on idea that radiation load can be lowered by setting suita-ble exposition parameters and collimators. Methodology consists of measurements of exposition dose in 100 patients at Institution of Imaging Methods and at Cardivascular Centre. I compare the dose at both work places on the base of different size of image amplifier, different frequency of scanning and advert to different dose in different projection. Other part consists of mea-surements on phantoms, in which I compare the dose acquired in patients. I watch fur-ther parameters impacting the level of radiation load.

25|$|According to {{a report}} {{published}} in October 2011 by the French Institute for <b>Radiological</b> <b>Protection</b> and Nuclear Safety, between 21 March and mid-July around 2.7×1016Bq of caesium-137 (about 8.4kg) entered the ocean, about 82percent having flowed into the sea before 8 April. This emission of radioactivity into the sea represents the most important individual emission of artificial radioactivity into the sea ever observed. However, the Fukushima coast {{has some of the}} world's strongest currents and these transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, thus causing great dispersion of the radioactive elements. The results of measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident, in terms of radioactivity, would be minor for marine life as of autumn 2011 (weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments). On the other hand, significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plant might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated soil. Further, some coastal areas might have less-favorable dilution or sedimentation characteristics than those observed so far. Finally, the possible presence of other persistent radioactive substances, such as strontium-90 or plutonium, has not been sufficiently studied. Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the coast of Fukushima district. Organisms that filter water and fish {{at the top of the}} food chain are, over time, the most sensitive to caesium pollution. It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima. Despite caesium isotopic concentration in the waters off of Japan being 10 to 1000 times above concentration prior to the accident, radiation risks are below what is generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is twofold. The first {{is to develop a}} set of {{behavioral}} parameters for a reference person specific for the Savannah River Site (SRS) such that the parameters can be used to determine dose to members of the public in compliance with Department of Energy (DOE) Order 458. 1 “Radiation Protection of the Public and the Environment. ” A reference person is a hypothetical, gender and age aggregation of human physical and physiological characteristics arrived at by international consensus for the purpose of standardizing radiation dose calculations. DOE O 458. 1 states that compliance with the annual dose limit of 100 mrem (1 mSv) to a member of the public may be demonstrated by calculating the dose to the maximally exposed individual (MEI) or to a representative person. Historically, for dose compliance, SRS has used the MEI concept, which uses adult dose coefficients and adult male usage parameters. Beginning with the 2012 annual site environmental report, SRS will be using the representative person concept for dose compliance. The dose to a representative person will be based on 1) the SRS-specific reference person usage parameters at the 95 th percentile of appropriate national or regional data, which are documented in this report, 2) the reference person (gender and age averaged) ingestion and inhalation dose coefficients provided in DOE Derived Concentration Technical Standard (DOE-STD- 1196 - 2011), and 3) the external dose coefficients provided in the DC_PAK 3 toolbox. The second {{purpose of this}} report is to develop SRS-specific derived concentration standards (DCSs) for all applicable food ingestion pathways, ground shine, and water submersion. The DCS is the concentration of a particular radionuclide in water, in air, or on the ground that results in a member of the public receiving 100 mrem (1 mSv) effective dose following continuous exposure for one year.

40|$|Background and purpose: The p 38 kinase {{regulates the}} release of proinflammatory cytokines {{including}} tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) and {{is regarded as a}} potential therapeutic target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Using the novel p 38 inhibitor Org 48762 - 0, we investigated the therapeutic potential of p 38 inhibition and compared this to anti-mouse (m) TNF alpha antibody treatment in murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Experimental approach: Pharmacological profiles of Org 48762 - 0 were characterized in kinase assays, cellular assays and in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced inflammation in mice. The effects of Org 48762 - 0 and of mTNF alpha-neutralization on established arthritis were examined in murine CIA. Key results: Org 48762 - 0 potently inhibited p 38 alpha kinase {{with a high degree of}} kinase selectivity. In cellular assays, Org 48762 - 0 reduced LPS-induced TNF alpha release. Oral administration of Org 48762 - 0 in mice showed drug-like pharmacokinetic properties and inhibited LPS-induced cytokine production. These pharmacological characteristics of Org 48762 - 0 prompted a comparison of therapeutic efficacy with mTNF alpha-neutralization in CIA. Org 48762 - 0 and anti-mTNF alpha antibody treatment equally inhibited development of arthritis when evaluated macroscopically. <b>Radiological</b> analyses revealed <b>protection</b> against bone damage for both treatments, although statistical difference was reached with Org 48762 - 0 treatment only.

The critical aggregation concentration increased from 0. 6 mg · L- 1 to 88 mg · L- 1 with {{decrease in the}} degree of CA substitution. Osthole (OST) could be easily encapsulated into the CA-TMC micelles. The highest entrapment efficiency and drug loading of OST-loaded CA-TMC micelles(OST/CA-TMC) were 79. 1 % and 19. 1 %, respectively. The antitumor efficacy results show that OST/CA-TMC micelles have significant antitumor activity on Hela and MCF- 7 cells, with a 50 % of cell growth inhibition (IC 50) of 35. 8 and 46. 7 µg · mL- 1, respectively. Cell apoptosis was the main effect on cell death of Hela and MCF- 7 cells after OST administration. The blank micelles did not affect apoptosis or cell death of Hela and MCF- 7 cells. The fluorescence imaging results indicated that OST/CA-TMC micelles could be easily uptaken by Hela and MCF- 7 cells and could localize in the cell nuclei. These findings suggest that CA-TMC micelles are promising carriers for OST delivery in cancer therapy. Keywords: N-trimethyl chitosan, micelle solubilization, antitumor activit...|$|R
