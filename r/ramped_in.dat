6000|$|I {{had just}} {{time to give}} a glance at these matters, when about twelve blue-coated {{servants}} burst into the hall with much tumult and talk, each rather employed in directing his comrades than in discharging his own duty. Some brought blocks and billets to the fire, which roared, blazed, and ascended, half in smoke, half in flame, up a huge tunnel, with an opening wide enough to accommodate a stone seat within its ample vault, and which was fronted, by way of chimney-piece, with a huge piece of heavy architecture, where the monsters of heraldry, embodied by the art of some Northumbrian chisel, grinned and <b>ramped</b> <b>in</b> red free-stone, now japanned by the smoke of centuries. Others of these old-fashioned serving-men bore huge smoking dishes, loaded with substantial fare; others brought in cups, flagons, bottles, yea barrels of liquor. All tramped, kicked, plunged, shouldered, and jostled, doing as little service with as much tumult as could well be imagined. At length, while the dinner was, after various efforts, {{in the act of}} being arranged upon the board, [...] "the clamour much of men and dogs," [...] the cracking of whips, calculated for the intimidation of the latter, voices loud and high, steps which, impressed by the heavy-heeled boots of the period, clattered like those in the statue of the Festin de Pierre,* announced the arrival of those for whose benefit the preparations were made.|$|E
60|$|It {{struck him}} {{afterwards}} that his action {{might have seemed}} uncivil, and even inhuman, to the bruised cyclist, who could hardly walk. But it was getting late, {{and he was still}} far from the Hall, which, oddly enough, seemed to be no longer visible from the road. He wandered on for some time, half convinced that he had passed the lodge gates, yet hoping to find some other entrance to the domain. Dusk was falling; the rounded outlines of the park trees beyond the wall were solid masses of shadow. The full moon, presently rising, restored them again to symmetry, and at last he, to his relief, came upon the massive gateway. Two lions <b>ramped</b> <b>in</b> stone on the side pillars. He thought it strange that he had not noticed the gateway on his previous entrance, but he remembered that he was fully preoccupied with the advancing figure of his uncle. In a few minutes the Hall itself appeared, and here again he was surprised that he had overlooked before its noble proportions and picturesque outline. Its broad terraces, dazzlingly white in the moonlight; its long line of mullioned windows, suffused with a warm red glow from within, made it look like part of a wintry landscape--and suggested a Christmas card. The venerable ivy that hid the ravages time had made in its walls looked like black carving. His heart swelled with strange emotions as he gazed at his ancestral hall. How many of his blood had lived and died there; how many had gone forth from that great porch to distant lands! He tried to think of his father--a little child--peeping between the balustrades of that terrace. He tried to think of it, and perhaps would have succeeded had it not occurred to him that it was a known fact that his uncle had bought the estate and house of an impoverished nobleman only the year before. Yet--he could not tell why--he seemed to feel higher and nobler for that trial.|$|E
50|$|Cyclic voltammetry (CV) {{is a type}} of potentiodynamic {{electrochemical}} measurement. In a {{cyclic voltammetry}} experiment, the working electrode potential is ramped linearly versus time. Unlike in linear sweep voltammetry, after the set potential is reached in a CV experiment, the working electrode's potential is <b>ramped</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction to return to the initial potential. These cycles of ramps in potential may be repeated as many times as needed. The current at the working electrode is plotted versus the applied voltage (that is, the working electrode's potential) to give the cyclic voltammogram trace. Cyclic voltammetry is generally used to study the electrochemical properties of an analyte in solution.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{calculations of}} the evolution of an optically prepared Rydberg wavepacket in the presence of time-dependent inhomogeneous electric fields and the results have relevance to the stabilization of Rydberg states as appropriate to ZEKE spectroscopy. The field is considered to arise from the combination of an applied field, which may be <b>ramped</b> <b>in</b> time, and the presence of microscopic charges, e. g., a pseudo-random distribution of ions, whose positions may also change with time. The results of the calculations lead to a clearer definition of the conditions under which Rydberg stabilization is achieved, such as in field switching experiments (Baranov et al., Chem. Phys. Lett., 1998, 291, 311), and also confirm the mechanisms by which the randomization of population between blue-shifted and red-shifted Stark states occurs in the presence of micro-fields due to ions (Palm et al., Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London, Ser. A, 1997, 355, 1551). The motion of the ions is found to have a significant m-locking effect in the calculations, providing a possible mechanism for the commonly observed long-lifetime tail in the population decay of high-n Rydberg states...|$|E
30|$|For {{the single}} atom {{transport}} in {{the conveyor belt}} optical lattice [50], a relative detuning δ between the two lattice beams is employed to create a standing wave pattern, moving at velocity v=λ_latδ/ 2. For a typical transport, the detuning between the beams is <b>ramped</b> <b>in</b> a trapezoid shape: a linear ramp from zero to the maximum detuning yields an acceleration of the atoms in the lattice, followed by a plateau of constant detuning where the atoms move at constant velocity. After this plateau, the detuning is ramped back to zero and the atoms are decelerated again. The transport distance is given by the integral over the velocity. Thereby large transport distances {{in the range of}} millimeters can be realized, which are only limited by trap size. This is in contrast to phase shifting transport approaches, where the maximum transport distance is given by the maximum phase shift [60]. The absolute maximum acceleration a_ = k U_ 0 / m_Cs≈ 4 · 10 ^ 5 m/s^ 2 in the lattice is determined by the Cs mass m_Cs, the laser wave number k and the potential depth U_ 0 ≈ 1.5 mK of the standing wave potential.|$|E
40|$|Neural gastric {{electrical}} stimulation (NGES) {{could be a}} new technique for treating obesity. However, chronic animal experimentation exploring the efficacy of this therapy is lacking. In this study we investigated the utility of retrograde NGES in a chronic canine model. Nine mongrel dogs (26. 8 ± 5. 2 kg) underwent laparoscopic implantation of 2 -channel neurostimulator leads in the distal antrum. Five dogs formed a control group and four dogs underwent stimulation. Food intake and weight dynamics were regularly monitored during two separate research protocols, each comprising 2 -week baseline, stimulation and washout periods. The stimulation voltage was constant in the first protocol and was <b>ramped</b> <b>in</b> the second. In the first protocol three out of the four stimulated dogs demonstrated significant decrease in food intake (P 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 05). However, this materialized in a significant weight reduction in one dog only. In the second protocol, all stimulated dogs exhibited significant food intake and weight reduction (P 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 05) compared to controls. Necropsies and histopathological analysis did not reveal any abnormalities in the stomach, the adjacent organs or around the implant. NGES could be a safe new technique for reducing food intake and weight and, therefore, it might be helpful for treating obesity...|$|E

40|$|For {{possible}} future accelerator projects, as, e. g., the Super-Conducting Proton Linac, SPL, at CERN, {{it would be}} desirable to reuse {{as much of the}} LEP/RF equipment as possible. In the SPL, as in other proposed proton linacs, pulsed operation is required with RF pulse-lengths varying between 1 and 3 ms and a pulse repetition rate of 50 Hz. The LEP klystrons are equipped with a modulation anode by means of which their beam current and hence the output power can be controlled. In LEP the klystron output power had to be varied very slowly when the energy was <b>ramped.</b> <b>In</b> order to keep a high efficiency also in pulsed mode the rise- and fall-time of the beam pulse in the klystron should be considerably less than 100 µs. This goal was achieved by modifying the tetrode modulator, the HV line between modulator and klystron, and the filter network of the HV power supply. SPICE simulations were performed to evaluate the optimum values of capacitors and inductors in the HV filtering network of the LEP 100 kV, 40 A power converter when a specified DC pulse shape is required and up to eight klystrons are to be powered by one HV supply. These simulations are presented, together with the experimental results obtained on a modified LEP klystron/power converter assembly...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} {{is presented in}} this paper to link optical emission spectrum analysis to the quality of clad layers produced with laser metal deposition (LMD). A Nd:YAG laser (λ = 1. 064 μm) was used to produce clad tracks with Metco 42 C powder on AISI 4140 steel substrate. The laser power was <b>ramped</b> <b>in</b> steps of 220 W from 800 W to 2780 W focusing the laser beam into a 4. 8 mm diameter spot. A constant cladding speed of 10 mm s− 1 is used with a powder feeding rate of 0. 36 g s− 1. The extent of metallic bonding is evaluated from dilution data obtained by measuring the melt depth in the substrate from cross sections of the clads. The spectra generated during the deposition process were collected with an optical spectrometer attached to the laser head. The discrete spectral lines from the collected spectra were identified from the NIST database as Fe I and Cr I lines. Two different spectral analysis methods were used, namely the calculation of the electron temperature Te and the intensity ratio IR. The electron temperature Te is computed from four discrete Cr I lines at 526. 415, 529. 827, 532. 834, and 534. 044 nm wavelength. The intensity ratio IR {{is a measure of the}} absorption of a discrete Fe I line at 588. 91 nm. The analysis of the collected spectra indicates that onset and extent of metallic bonding can be detected with a spectrometer during the deposition process. A sudden decrease of the IR signal during the LMD process indicates the onset of metallic bonding. A further increase of the laser power mainly contributes to an increase in melt depth, leading to a higher dilution. In this region, the Te signal shows a better correlation with the dilutio...|$|E
40|$|A {{multinuclear}} {{solid state}} NMR approach {{is applied to}} four templated mesoporous oxides (silica, titania, niobia and tantala) to include 15 N and 17 O magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and double resonance 15 N− 93 Nb, 17 O Rotational-Echo Adiabatic Passage Double Resonance (REAPDOR). The templated samples were <b>ramped</b> <b>in</b> steps of 20 °C for 2 days up to typically 110 °C where the samples were left for 2 − 4 days. 15 N MAS NMR shows that amines are the only species present in the TiO 2, Nb 2 O 5, and Ta 2 O 5. In SiO 2, amines are only present as a minor coordination (10 ± 2 %), but there are several strong ammonium 15 N resonances. The REAPDOR experiments show that the nitrogen interacts with niobium, confirming a ligand interaction between the Nb and N, as previously believed. In the case of silica, the amine is quaternized and there is apparently no interaction with the Si, suggesting a RNH 3 + −O−Si- hydrogen-bonding interaction with the walls. 17 O MAS NMR provides the clearest indication of the local wall structure. In the aged, templated samples in all cases only OM 2 coordinations are present which {{is very different from}} the pure bulk oxides (apart from SiO 2) and must be due to the effects of amine coordination at the metal centers. On removal of the template, these oxides behave differently, with Ta 2 O 5 showing a mixture of OTa 2 (85 ± 5 %) and OTa 3 (15 ± 5 %) which is similar to the types of coordination found in the bulk oxide. The previously reported 17 O MAS NMR data from heat-treated mesoporous niobia shows only ONb 2, which is very highly ordered. In contrast for titania, the OTi 2 coordination is immediately lost on removal of the template to be replaced by a mixture of OTi 3 (60 ± 5 %) and OTi 4 (40 ± 5 %), with the OTi 4 becoming dominant above 250 °C, very different behavior from the corresponding bulk oxide. In summary, this NMR study shows that the local oxygen coordination in amine-templated mesoporous transition metal oxides is present as OM 2 which is relatively rare in bulk oxides. The data indicates that the template interaction is largely controlled by the N−M dative bond to the wall, suppressing higher oxygen coordination numbers. Qualitatively it appears that the strength of this interaction varies greatly in the different mesoporous oxides...|$|E
