50|$|To {{switch the}} NRAM between states, a small voltage {{greater than the}} <b>read</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied between top and bottom electrodes. If the NRAM is in the 0 state, the voltage applied will cause an {{electrostatic}} attraction between the CNTs close each other causing a SET operation. After the applied voltage is removed, the CNTs remain in a 1 or low resistance state due to physical adhesion (Van der Waals force) with an activation energy (Ea) of approximately 5eV. If the NRAM cell is in the 1 state, applying a voltage greater than the <b>read</b> <b>voltage</b> will generate CNT phonon excitations with sufficient energy to separate the CNT junctions. This is the phonon driven RESET operation. The CNTs remain in the OFF or high resistance state due to the high mechanical stiffness (Young's Modulus 1 TPa) with an activation energy (Ea) much greater than 5 eV. Figure 2 illustrates both states of an individual pair of CNTs involved in the switch operation. Due to the high activation energy (> 5eV) required for switching between states, the NRAM switch resists outside interference like radiation and operating temperature that can erase or flip conventional memories like DRAM.|$|E

40|$|Retention errors, {{caused by}} charge leakage over time, are the {{dominant}} source of flash memory errors. Understanding, characterizing, and reducing retention errors can significantly improve NAND flash memory reliability and endurance. In this paper, we first characterize, with real 2 y-nm MLC NAND flash chips, how the threshold voltage distribution of flash memory changes with different retention age – {{the length of}} time since a flash cell was programmed. We observe from our characterization results that 1) the optimal <b>read</b> reference <b>voltage</b> of a flash cell, using which the data can be read with the lowest raw bit error rate (RBER), systematically changes with its retention age, and 2) different regions of flash memory can have different retention ages, and hence different optimal <b>read</b> reference <b>voltages.</b> Based on our findings, we propose two new techniques. First, Retention Optimized Reading (ROR) adaptively learns and applies the optimal <b>read</b> reference <b>voltage</b> for each flash memory block online. The key idea of ROR is to periodically learn a tight upper bound, and from there approach the optimal <b>read</b> reference <b>voltage.</b> Our evaluations show that ROR can extend flash memory lifetime by 64 % and reduce average error correction latency by 10. 1 %, with only 768 KB storage overhead in flash memory for a 512 GB flash-based SSD. Second, Retention Failure Recovery (RFR) recovers data with uncorrectable errors offline by identifying and probabilistically correcting flash cells with retention errors. Our evaluation shows that RFR reduces RBER by 50 %, which essentially doubles the error correction capability, and thus can effectively recover data from otherwise uncorrectable flash error...|$|R
