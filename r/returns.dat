5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected to}} hold those assets offering greater <b>returns,</b> be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the <b>returns</b> on domestic assets and the <b>returns</b> on foreign assets. That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent <b>returns,</b> but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent <b>returns</b> from either investment decision.|$|E
