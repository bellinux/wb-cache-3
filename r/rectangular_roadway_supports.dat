30|$|Based on {{geological}} {{and mining}} characteristics, coal mine roadways under complex conditions {{were divided into}} five types, for each type the deformation and damage characteristics of rocks surrounding roadways were analyzed. The recent developments of <b>roadway</b> <b>support</b> technologies were introduced abroad, based on the experiences of supports for deep and complex roadways from Germany, the United States and Australia. The history and achievements of <b>roadway</b> <b>support</b> technologies in China were detailed, including rock bolting, steel supports, grouting reinforcement and combined supports. Four typical support and reinforcement case studies were analyzed, including a high stressed roadway 1, 000  m below the surface, a roadway surrounded by severely weak and broken rocks, a chamber surrounded by weak and broken rocks, and a roadway with very soft and swelling rocks. Based on studies and practices in many years, rock bolting has become the mainstream <b>roadway</b> <b>support</b> form in China coal mines, and steel supports, grouting reinforcement and combined supports have also been applied at proper occasions, which have provided reliable technical measures for the safe and high effective construction and mining of underground coal mines.|$|R
30|$|In a full {{coal seam}} roadway, high {{prestress}} powerful bolt and anchor cables {{should be used}} to become the single necessary support during the service life of the roadway, avoiding second <b>roadway</b> <b>support</b> and <b>roadway</b> maintenance.|$|R
30|$|Although the {{achievements}} and developments mentioned above {{have been made}} in <b>roadway</b> <b>support</b> technologies, {{there are still a lot}} of researches need to be done in the future. The geomechanics measurements for deep and complex roadways should be strengthened to further understand underground geological and stress environments; the deformation and damage mechanism of complex roadways should be further deeply studied and interaction between surrounding rocks and supports should be more clearly expounded; the <b>supporting</b> technologies for <b>roadways</b> surrounding with extra soft rock or extra broken rock, roadways with intense floor heave, and roadways with rock burst, need to be developed to solve the associated <b>roadway</b> <b>support</b> problems.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Coal {{being one}} of the main energy {{resources}} in China. Coal industry {{plays an important role in}} the domestic economy. <b>Roadway</b> <b>support</b> is a key technology in coal mining, and the mechanical properties of surrounding rock directly affect the stability of <b>roadways</b> and their <b>supporting</b> structure. In order to solve the problem of gateway support for C 8 coal seam, In terms of the rheological data got from the argillaceous siltstone samples and the influence that loading history has on rock deformation, it employs Burgers model to reflect the creep characteristics of rock.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an investigation {{on the characteristics}} of overlying strata collapse and mining-induced pressure in fault-influenced zone by employing the physical modeling in consideration of fault structure. The precursory information of fault slip during the underground mining activities is studied as well. Based on the physical modeling, the optimization of <b>roadway</b> <b>support</b> design and the field verification in fault-influenced zone are conducted. Physical modeling results show that, due to the combined effect of mining activities and fault slip, the mining-induced pressure and the extent of damaged rock masses in the fault-influenced zone are greater than those in the uninfluenced zone. The sharp increase and the succeeding stabilization of stress or steady increase in displacement can be identified as the precursory information of fault slip. Considering the larger mining-induced pressure in the fault-influenced zone, the new support design utilizing cables is proposed. The optimization of <b>roadway</b> <b>support</b> design suggests that the cables can be anchored in the stable surrounding rocks and can effectively mobilize the load bearing capacity of the stable surrounding rocks. The field observation indicates that the roadway is in good condition with the optimized <b>roadway</b> <b>support</b> design...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The University of Wollongong in {{collaboration}} with the Australian coal mining industry has shown that a viable polymer-based alternative to steel mesh in underground <b>roadway</b> <b>support</b> applications can be developed to eliminate the use and handling of steel mesh. The feasibility of developing polymeric alternatives to steel mesh in underground <b>roadway</b> <b>support</b> applications has been established, the physical and material constraints to be endured by any new polymeric skin reinforcement system have been identified by measuring the mechanical properties of steel mesh, and materials that can be spray-applied have been identified. The study has also shown that polymer mechanical properties can be optimised to produce similar mechanical properties (modulus, yield stress, elongation-at-break etc) to steel mesh. The identified materials will allow the face support cycle to be fully automated, or at least remotely operated and installed, enabling the removal of personnel from the immediate face area, thus contributing to a projected substantial improvement in underground roadway development rates...|$|R

30|$|In mine <b>roadway</b> <b>support</b> operations, floor bolting {{not only}} {{played a role}} in floor heave control, but also in {{reinforcing}} roof and its two sides. Correspondingly, bolting of roof and two sides also played a part in floor heave control. To quantify the effect of such bolting, based on <b>roadway</b> <b>support</b> in extremely weak rock, three physical models were produced and tested in laboratory. Through comparison of their displacements in three physical simulation experiments, the reinforcing effect of bolting in extremely weak rock roadways was quantified. Reinforcing coefficients was defined as displacement ratio between original support and new support regime. Results indicated that the reinforcing coefficients, for bolting of roof and its two sides, on floor, two sides, and roof reached 2.18, 3.56, and 1.81 respectively. The reinforcing coefficients for floor bolting on floor, two sides, and roof reached 3.06, 2.34, and 1.39 respectively. So in this extremely weak rock, the surrounding rock should be considered as an integral structure in any support operation: this allows for better local strength improvement, and provided future design guidance.|$|R
