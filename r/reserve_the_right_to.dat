5|$|The Liniers {{administration}} was popular among criollos, but not among peninsulars {{such as the}} merchant Martín de Álzaga and the Governor of Montevideo, Francisco Javier de Elío. They requested the Spanish authorities appoint a new viceroy. In {{the wake of the}} outbreak of the Peninsular War, de Elío created the Junta of Montevideo, which would scrutinise all the orders from Buenos Aires and <b>reserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> ignore them, but did not openly deny the authority of the Viceroy or declare Montevideo independent.|$|E

25|$|Nobility was {{a social}} distinction, so even the unfree ministerials were {{considered}} higher in precedence than a free commoner. Being of a noble estate, ministerials were exempt from the more odious of corvée duties that other types of serfs performed, though some lieges would <b>reserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> commandeer plow-teams and draft horses. Some ministerial women did perform household duties but were well-compensated for the chores.|$|E
25|$|A {{new problem}} with {{easements}} on federal land had arisen. The best geographic route for Lee Boulevard crossed the northwestern tip of Fort Myer. The War Department {{was willing to}} grant an easement to the state to construct this road, but insisted on maintaining jurisdiction over the property. That was unacceptable {{to the state of}} Virginia. Other federal officials said that the federal government would also continue to <b>reserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> build other approaches to Arlington Memorial Bridge, which the state of Virginia also opposed.|$|E

25|$|A crest, {{which was}} little used, {{is thought to}} have been created for the {{ascension}} of James I. This crest was blazoned: A tower triple towered or, from the portal a hart springing argent, attired and unguled also or. The torse was Or and azure. The torse and crest were apparently little used even during the period of the Kingdom of Ireland. From the Acts of Union in 1801 until the declaration of the Republic of Ireland in 1949, the crest was used only intermittently. Unlike Scotland, Ireland did not <b>reserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> bear a distinct coat of arms within the United Kingdom.

25|$|In the Reich, {{sports are}} the sole {{province}} of the Aryans and are controlled by the German Federation of Sport — which favors German sportsmen over sportsmen from other states. It {{has the power to}} <b>reserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> withdraw from competition with foreign teams; and to withhold the rights of foreign teams to tour the Reich when political relations sour. An example is boycotting Italian sports teams after a riot at a football match in Milan between home team fans and the visiting Leipzig team fans. Deprivation of the right to tour the Reich, and of having Reich teams visit, is financially hurtful. Germany won a recent World Cup but now is challenged by a powerful, multi-racial Brazil comprising Negroes and Native Americans, and others.|$|E

A netmail message would contain {{the name of the}} person sending, the name of the intended recipient, and the respective FidoNet addresses of each. The FidoNet system was responsible for routing the message from one system to the other (details below), with the bulletin board software on each end being responsible for ensuring that only the intended recipient could read it. Due to the hobbyist nature of the network, any privacy between sender and recipient was only the result of politeness from the owners of the FidoNet systems involved in the mail's transfer.

25|$|In January 2015, the City of Galveston {{issued a}} Request for Qualifications {{concerning}} the future promoter of the Strand Entertainment District where the same criteria {{proposed for the}} 2011-15 contract will remain the same (live entertainment from national touring acts limited to recording artists, bands, along with paid admission (on Fridays and Saturdays prior to Fat Tuesday with free admission on Sundays - this was amended during {{the latter part of}} the previous 2011-15 contract) and gated checkpoints/bag checks (which is stipulated under the new contract in the wake of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings) but the contract (which lasted five years without a contract extension) is limited to 3 years where the City of Galveston can <b>reserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> extend the contract for an additional two years. Some Strand businessowners who voiced their displeasure with Yaga's Entertainment would rather have the Strand Entertainment District managed like the Lone Star Rally since they do not set up gated checkpoints - their touring acts (live music) are usually performed at 2 stages.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{necessary}} for a trademark owner to take enforcement action against all infringement {{if it can be}} shown that the owner perceived the infringement to be minor and inconsequential. This is designed to prevent owners from continually being tied up in litigation for fear of cancellation. An owner can at any time commence action for infringement against a third party as long as it had not previously notified the third party of its discontent following third party use and then failed to take action within a reasonable period of time (called acquiescence). The owner can always <b>reserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> take legal action until a court decides that the third party had gained notoriety which the owner 'must' have been aware of. It will be for the third party to prove their use of the mark is substantial as it is the onus of a company using a mark to check they are not infringing previously registered rights. In the US, owing to the overwhelming number of unregistered rights, trademark applicants are advised to perform searches not just of the trademark register but of local business directories and relevant trade press. Specialized search companies perform such tasks prior to application.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} {{to end the}} ban was welcomed by broadcasters. Michael Grade, who was then chief executive of Channel 4, said it had ended [...] "one of the most embarrassing attempts to censor coverage {{of the most important}} domestic political story of post-war years", while John Birt commented, [...] "We can once again apply normal and testing scrutiny to all sides in the debate". Sinn Féin also signalled their approval, but the ban's lifting was viewed with more caution by unionist politicians. Peter Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party felt the decision was premature while the IRA remained an armed organisation.

500|$|Despite {{remaining}} unenthusiastic {{with the}} script, Kanter agreed to commission it {{as a film}} {{on the condition that}} he <b>reserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> select a [...] "" [...] director. Anderson would have selected David Lane, who had directed the two Thunderbirds film sequels, Thunderbirds Are Go (1966) and Thunderbird 6 (1968). After a ten-week delay to filming, Robert Parrish, an American director whose latest project had been shelved, accepted the post. Parrish's film career up to 1968 had included co-editing Body and Soul (for which he had shared the 1947 Academy Award for Best Film Editing) and co-directing the 1967 James Bond spoof, Casino Royale. Anderson remembered Parrish as being [...] "very ingratiating", stating that he [...] "told us he loved the script and said it would be an honour to work with us. Jay Kanter gave Bob the thumbs up and we were in business." [...] Although the box office failure of Casino Royale had prompted Anderson to question Parrish's ability, he stated that Doppelgänger could not have been made without his recruitment: [...] "It wasn't a question of, 'Will we get on with him?' or, 'Is he the right man?' He was a name director, so we signed him up immediately." ...|$|E
