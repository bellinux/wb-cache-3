50|$|Those who are {{classified}} as <b>residents</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> need to file Form 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ. Those who {{are classified}} as nonresidents <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> need to file Form 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ.|$|R

50|$|A <b>resident</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> {{is subject}} to income tax on income from all sources, whereas {{non-residents}} for tax purposes are only subject to income tax in Australia on their income from Australian sources.|$|E
50|$|<b>Residents</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> are {{generally}} required to file Form 1040 {{or one of}} its variants (Form 1040A or Form 1040EZ). Non-residents <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> {{are generally}} required to file Form 1040NR (or its variant, Form 1040NR-EZ). For those who are nonresidents <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes,</b> the relevant information about when the person was present in the United States, and the calculations based on that {{to show that the}} person fails the SPT, are done in Schedule OI, which is the fifth and last page of Form 1040NR. Those who would otherwise qualify as <b>residents</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> under the SPT, but are seeking an exemption, may need to file additional forms (such as Form 8840 or Form 8843) as discussed in the exemptions section.|$|R
50|$|Also, nonresidents who are {{in certain}} types of statuses (F, J, M, and Q) are not {{required}} to pay Social Security or Medicare <b>taxes</b> <b>for</b> employment that falls within their status. However, this is not really specific to nonresidents, since <b>residents</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> (including citizens and green card holders) are also exempt from Social Security and Medicare <b>taxes</b> <b>for</b> income earned where the employer is the educational institution, subject to a number of caveats. However, the distinction becomes relevant to on-campus employment not by the university, as well as to off-campus employment undertaken under Optional Practical Training or Curricular Practical Training: students in such employment need to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes if and only if they have become <b>residents</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nonresidents <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> may not {{be allowed}} to take the {{standard}} deduction that is available to <b>residents</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b> The <b>tax</b> exemptions (as well as withholding exemptions) permitted for a nonresident depend on the nature of tax agreement between the nonresident's country of tax residence and the United States.|$|R
50|$|In particular, any {{individual}} {{who was in}} the United States in a non-exempt status for more than 6 months during the tax year qualifies the SPT and (unless exempted based on one of the exemptions) must be treated as a <b>resident</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|E
50|$|If {{the student}} is a <b>resident</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes,</b> there is no federal or state tax withholding, and no form need be issued to the student. However, {{the student is}} still obliged to report the income in Line 7 of the Form 1040, and {{it is part of}} the student's taxable income.|$|E
50|$|If an {{individual}} meets the Substantial Presence Test, then, {{at the time}} of tax filing, he/she is treated as a <b>resident</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> for the part of the calendar year starting from the first day of physical presence in the United States, including the part of the year before he/she accrued a substantial presence in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Form 1040 (officially, the [...] "U.S. Individual Income Tax Return") is one {{of three}} IRS tax forms (see {{variants}} section for explanations of each) used for personal (individual) federal income tax returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by United States <b>residents</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{taxation}} {{of income}} for H-1B employees depends on whether they are categorized as either non-resident aliens or <b>resident</b> aliens <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b> A non-resident alien <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> is only <b>taxed</b> on income from the United States, while a <b>resident</b> alien <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> is <b>taxed</b> on all income, including income from outside the US.|$|R
50|$|<b>Residents</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> {{are also}} exempt from Social Security and Medicare <b>taxes</b> <b>for</b> income earned where the {{employer}} is the educational institution, {{subject to a}} number of caveats. Residents do need to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on both on-campus employment not by their university, as well as off-campus employment such as that undertaken as part of Curricular Practical Training and Optional Practical Training.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to be a <b>resident</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> in the United States but to not be a permanent resident of the United States. A non-citizen can be a permanent resident of the United States only if he/she holds a Green Card. On the other hand, people on non-immigrant visas may well be treated as residents for tax purposes.|$|E

On the other hand, people on non-immigrant visas may well be treated as residents for tax purposes if they pass the Substantial Presence Test.|$|E
50|$|The {{tax regime}} {{that applies to}} {{students}} under OPT depends on whether they qualify as resident aliens or nonresident aliens for tax purposes. The first five calendar years in student status (F-1) are exempt from the Substantial Presence Test used to determine eligibility for being a resident alien for tax purposes, after which approximately six months in the United States makes one a <b>resident</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Foreign {{individuals}} {{present in}} Russia for 183 {{days in a}} year or more are treated as <b>residents</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> and are <b>taxed</b> at common 13 percent rates. If they are present in Russia for less than 183 days, they are subject to 30 percent income <b>tax</b> (15 percent <b>for</b> dividends). Wages and salaries paid to foreigners in Russia are subject to standard UST tax.|$|R
50|$|A person seeking {{exemption}} in {{this manner}} is required to file Form 8843 along {{with his or her}} tax return. In fact, even those who have no income need to file Form 8843 to inform the IRS that they are in student status and are not <b>residents</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b> <b>For</b> those with taxable income, Form 8843 must be filed as part of the tax return by the usual tax filing deadline (April 15, but can be deferred up to six months to October 15) and for those with no taxable income, the filing deadline is June 15.|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} the tax-exempt status of {{municipal}} bonds provides little or no subsidy to capital investment by communities. Instead, the tax exemption simply provides arbitrage opportunities to high and low tax bracket individuals while leaving individuals in intermediate tax brackets essentially unaffected. We also {{argue that the}} revenue cost of the tax exemption is much less than traditionally thought due to the portfolio rebalancing that would occur if the tax exemption were eliminated. Finally, we note {{that the only way}} to prevent all municipal arbitrage possibilities would be to pass through municipal interest income and payments to <b>residents</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|While the CCF {{is treated}} as tax {{transparent}} under Irish law, {{it will be a}} matter for the jurisdiction in which the investor is <b>resident</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> to determine whether similar tax treatment will be granted in that jurisdiction to the CCF. Similarly, the tax authority of the jurisdiction in which the income arises must also recognise the tax transparency of the CCF.|$|E
50|$|The European Union Savings Directive (EUSD), {{formally}} Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003 on taxation {{of savings}} income {{in the form of}} interest payments, is a directive of the European Union enacted to implement the European Union withholding tax, requiring member states to provide other member states with information on interest paid to achieve effective taxation of the payments in the member state where the taxpayer is <b>resident</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} a pension scheme to be {{recognised}} as a QNUPS it must meet strict HMRC guidelines. This requires companies providing QNUPS to reveal certain information to HMRC. Individuals wishing to transfer pension assets to a QNUPS must have been resident in the UK for tax purposes when the payment was being made or treated as being made. If they are not <b>resident</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes,</b> then they should be resident in the UK in the year the tax payment was made or {{in any of the}} five previous tax years.|$|E

30|$|For 2015, the new Russian Science Foundation, {{which has}} been {{established}} in 2013 and is now the largest government funding body, announced about its plans to stimulate internal mobility through special programs. Russian Science Foundation decided to focus on the geographic mobility of scientists. The first program will support projects chaired by either Russian or foreign scholars. Foreign scientists should be present in Russia for at least 183  days (to be considered <b>residents</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes).</b> Both Russian and foreign scholars may only chair those laboratories that were created outside Moscow or St. Petersburg. The general idea behind these regulations is to promote science in Russian province due to influx of high-level researchers from the Russian capitals and from abroad. The Foundations’ leadership plans to grant 50 to 100 awards anticipating some level of competition.|$|R
50|$|To be {{eligible}} for the WITB, the applicant or their spouse must be a Canadian <b>resident</b> <b>for</b> income <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> of at least 19 years of age as of December 31st, and cannot be a full-time student. The WITB can be claimed on line 453 of the income tax return if their income exceeds $3,000 for the calendar year.|$|R
50|$|Income earned through on-campus {{part-time}} or {{full-time employment}} is generally classified as wages. In {{order to be}} able to earn wages, the student needs to obtain a Social Security Number and fill Form I-9 and Form W-4 for the employer, just like United States workers. The employer issues a Form W-2 at the end of the year documenting the total income and withheld federal and state taxes. This total amount across all employers is filled in by the student on Line 7 of the Form 1040 (if a <b>resident</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes)</b> or Line 8 of Form 1040NR (if not).|$|E
5000|$|The Substantial Presence Test (SPT) is a {{criterion}} {{used by the}} Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States to determine whether an individual {{who is not a}} citizen or lawful permanent resident in the recent past qualifies as a [...] "resident for tax purposes" [...] or a [...] "nonresident for tax purposes"; it is a form of physical presence test. The SPT should be used in conjunction with the Green Card Test (the criterion that the individual possessed a valid Green Card at any time of the year). An individual who satisfies either one or both of these tests is treated as a <b>resident</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|E
50|$|By the Substantial Presence Test, {{a person}} who is in the United States for at least 31 days in the current year and for a {{weighted}} total of at least 183 days in the past three calendar years (using a weighting formula) is a <b>resident</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b> However, one can exclude up to five calendar years in F status from this calculation. In particular, people who are arriving in the United States {{for the first time in}} F status can file as nonresidents for tax purposes for the first five years. However, those who have been in the United States recently in other statuses may need to file as residents for tax purposes due to their past presence.|$|E
