40|$|In a base-isolated building, the <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings,</b> {{being as}} protectors of the superstructure, {{sometimes}} {{should also be}} protected from failure because the failure of <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings</b> may result in serious damage to superstructure. In this paper, three failure-prevention approaches of <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings</b> are proposed. The simplest way is to limit maximum stroke of <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings</b> with stoppers and buffers. This is called soft pounding protection. Another way is to arrange additional stiffness components at abutments in certain distance from the protected <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings,</b> which is called stiffness variable protection. The third way is to install backup supporters with friction sliding plate on their top beside <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings.</b> This is called soft landing protection.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a simple {{analysis}} method of axial deformation of base-isolation <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings</b> in a building subjected to earthquake loading and present its applicability to the analysis of the bound of the aspect ratio of base-isolated buildings. The base shear coefficient is introduced as a key parameter for the bound analysis. The bound of the aspect ratio of base-isolated buildings is analyzed based on the relationship of the following four quantities; (i) ultimate state of the tensile stress of <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings</b> based on a proposed simple recursive analysis for seismic loading, (ii) ultimate state of drift of the base-isolation story for seismic loading, (iii) ultimate state of the axial compressive stress of <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings</b> under dead loads, (iv) prediction of the overturning moment at the base for seismic loading. In particular, a new recursive analysis method of axial deformation of <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings</b> is presented taking into account the nonlinear tensile behavior of <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings</b> and it is shown that the relaxation of the constraint on the ultimate state of the tensile stress of <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings</b> increases the limiting aspect ratio...|$|R

According {{to the rule of}} axial forces redistributing between two kinds of bearings under earthquake, a calculating method considering the vertical force redistribute of isolation layer was given. With this method, the results of an example show that axial force will transfer from <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings</b> to sliding isolated bearings along with the horizontal displacement of isolation layer. The bigger the displacement is the more axial force transfers. So the axial-forces redistribution is a self-adjustable performance of the system, and also is an advantage for the system...|$|R

Equivalent linear model of hysteretic characteristics, computational method and the varying range of design parameters of LRB are presented. A full-bridge model of multi-span simple supported bridge with LRB is established in which box beam, LRB and piers are taken into account as a whole.

40|$|In this study, a {{rational}} and efficient optimal seismic design method for bridge system subjected to devastating earthquakes considering performance at ultimate state is proposed. The bridge system consists of superstructure, <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings,</b> RC piers and cast-in-place concrete pile foundation. In the proposed optimum design method, the optimum {{solutions for the}} heights of <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings,</b> cross-sectional dimensions and amount of steel reinforcements for RC piers and the detail of concrete pile foundation are determined for several allowable ductile factors of RC piers considering the constraints on the relative horizontal displacements of <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings</b> to the both bridge and transverse directions, the ductile factor of RC piers, and the constraint on the cast-in-place concrete pile foundation. From the practical design the heights of <b>rubber</b> <b>bearings</b> can take continuous values, but the other variables must be selected from discrete variable sets.

The optimum design problem is solved by a classical branch and bound method with dual algorithm.

40|$|Seismic {{isolation}} {{systems are}} widely used to protect reinforced concrete (RC) structures against the effects of strong ground motions. After a magnitude 6. 6 earthquake, the outpatient building of Lushan People’s hospital in China remained in good condition due to the seismic isolation technology, while the non-isolated older outpatient building nearby experienced major damage. The building provides {{a good opportunity to}} study and assess the contribution of isolation systems to seismic performance of RC structures. In the current research project, the isolated outpatient building was modelled and analyzed using computer software SAP 2000. The post-yield behaviour of the structure was modelled by assigning multi-linear plastic links to frame objects. The rubber isolators were represented by rubber isolator link elements, assigned as a single joint element between the ground and the superstructure. The isolated structure was subjected to four earthquake records with increasing intensity. The performances of the isolated structure were compared with those of the fixed-base structures in terms of lateral inter-storey drifts, peak absolute floor accelerations, and residual drifts.
