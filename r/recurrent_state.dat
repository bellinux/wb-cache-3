For this reason they occupy a central position in ASM research.

40|$|AbstractOver {{the last}} {{years there has been}} an {{increasing}} research effort directed towards the automatic verification of infinite state systems, such as timed automata, hybrid̈ automata, data-independent systems, relational automata, Petri nets, lossy channel systems, context-free and push-down processes. We present a method for deciding reachability properties of networks of timed processes. Such a network consists of an arbitrary set of identical timed automata, each with a single real-valued clock. Using a standard reduction from safety properties to reachability properties, we can use our algorithm to decide general safety properties of timed networks. To our knowledge, this is the first decidability result concerning verification of systems that are infinite-state in “two dimensions”: they contain an arbitrary set of (identical) processes, and they use infinite data-structures, viz real-valued clocks. We illustrate our method by showing how {{it can be used to}} automatically verify Fischer's protocol, a timer-based protocol for enforcing mutual exclusion among an arbitrary number of processes. Finally, we show undecidability of the <b>recurrent</b> <b>state</b> problem: given a state in a timed network, check whether there is a computation of the network visiting the state infinitely often. This implies undecidability of model checking for any temporal logic which is sufficiently expressive to encode the <b>recurrent</b> <b>state</b> problem, such as PTL, CTL, etc...|$|E
40|$|Simulation-based {{algorithms}} for {{maximizing the}} average reward of a parameterized Markov chain often rely upon {{the existence of}} a state which is recurrent for all choices of parameter values. For example, in the “batch ” simulation-based algorithm of Marbach and Tsitsiklis [28], a given <b>recurrent</b> <b>state</b> i ∗ is used to mark the onset of regenerative cycles within a simulation of the process, and the data collected in each cycle give rise to asymptotically unbiased estimates of the gradient of the average reward of the process. The question of which <b>recurrent</b> <b>state</b> should serve as i ∗ is a very important practical consideration in applications. Even when all states of the process are recurrent, some states tend to be visited more often than others, and lengthy renewal cycles tend to result in high variance estimates of the gradient. An appropriate choice of i ∗ is especially difficult when the steady state distribution of the process depends strongly on the parameters of the underlying Markov chain. To address this difficulty, we analyze a recently-proposed mechanism for adjusting i ∗ dynamically (i ∗-adaptation [8]) as applied to the “batch ” simulation-based algorithm of [28]. We show that the desirable convergence properties of the original algorithm are retained with i ∗-adaptation, namely the almost sure convergence of the parameter vector to a critical point, and we present an academic example which illustrates that i ∗-adaptation may significantly expand the range of applications of the original methodology...|$|E

40|$|We {{establish}} a full relationship between Kalman filtering and Amari's natural gradient in statistical learning. Namely, using an online natural gradient descent on data log-likelihood {{to evaluate the}} parameter of a probabilistic model {{from a series of}} observations, is exactly equivalent to using an extended Kalman filter to estimate the parameter (assumed to have constant dynamics). In the i. i. d. case, this relation is a consequence of the "information filter" phrasing of the extended Kalman filter. In the <b>recurrent</b> (<b>state</b> space, non-i. i. d.) case, we prove that the joint Kalman filter over states and parameters is a natural gradient on top of real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), a classical algorithm to train recurrent models. This exact algebraic correspondence provides relevant settings for natural gradient hyperparameters such as learning rates or initialization and regularization of the Fisher information matrix.

40|$|We use {{techniques}} {{from the}} theory of electrical networks to give nearly tight bounds for the transience class of the Abelian sandpile model on the two-dimensional grid up to polylogarithmic factors. The Abelian sandpile model is a discrete process on graphs that is intimately related to the phenomenon of self-organized criticality. In this process, vertices receive grains of sand, and once the number of grains exceeds their degree, they topple by sending grains to their neighbors.
