5|$|The {{design of}} {{intermediate}} technology ambulances {{must take into}} account not only the operation and maintenance of the ambulance, but its construction as well. The <b>robustness</b> of the design becomes more important, as does the nature of the skills required to properly operate the vehicle. Cost-effectiveness can be a high priority.|$|E
5|$|The language, and {{implementations}} thereof, {{should provide}} support for software engineering principles such as strong type checking, array bounds checking, detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables, and automatic garbage collection. Software <b>robustness,</b> durability, and programmer productivity are important.|$|E
5|$|This allows more {{resources}} to be allocated to more intensive strategies focusing on higher risk entities, providing an incentive to entities {{to want to be}} seen to be compliant. The <b>robustness</b> of the risk assessments, {{and the quality of the}} data on which the assessments rely, are therefore very important.|$|E

25|$|With {{respect to}} such {{limitations}} Kriete proposed consideration of systems-level properties like <b>robustness</b> to characterize ageing as a <b>robustness</b> tradeoff. According to this concept living systems {{evolve into a}} state of highly optimized tolerance promoting traits beneficial for survival and fitness at the cost of fragilities driving the ageing phenotype. The view is compatible with aspects of the antagonistic pleiotropy and the disposable soma theory, but offers additional mechanisms rooted in complex systems theory.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of the <b>robustness</b> of a SISO (single input single output) {{control system}} can be {{performed}} in the frequency domain, considering the system's transfer function and using Nyquist and Bode diagrams. Topics include gain and phase margin and amplitude margin. For MIMO (multi-input multi output) and, in general, more complicated control systems, one must consider the theoretical results devised for each control technique (see next section). I.e., if particular <b>robustness</b> qualities are needed, the engineer must shift his attention to a control technique by including them in its properties.|$|E

25|$|Both {{steganography}} {{and digital}} watermarking employ steganographic techniques to embed data covertly in noisy signals. While steganography aims for imperceptibility to human senses, digital watermarking tries {{to control the}} <b>robustness</b> as top priority.|$|E
25|$|In risk/portfolio management, copulas {{are used}} to perform stress-tests and <b>robustness</b> checks that are {{especially}} important during “downside/crisis/panic regimes” where extreme downside events may occur (e.g., the global financial crisis of 2007–2008).|$|E
25|$|A {{twisted pair}} variant {{in which the}} pairs are {{individually}} bonded to increase <b>robustness</b> of the cable. Pioneered by Belden, it means the electrical specifications of the cable are maintained despite rough handling.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the large}} number made and their <b>robustness,</b> many Anderson shelters still survive. Many were dug up {{after the war and}} {{converted}} into storage sheds for use in gardens and allotments.|$|E
25|$|Ferrocene and its {{numerous}} derivatives have no large-scale applications, {{but have}} many niche uses that exploit the unusual structure (ligand scaffolds, pharmaceutical candidates), <b>robustness</b> (anti-knock formulations, precursors to materials), and redox (reagents and redox standards).|$|E
25|$|A digital {{watermarking}} method {{is said to}} be of quantization type if the marked signal is obtained by quantization. Quantization watermarks suffer from low <b>robustness,</b> but have a high information capacity due to rejection of host interference.|$|E
25|$|The German {{time signal}} DCF77, in {{addition}} to amplitude keying, employs phase-shift keying driven by a 9-stage LFSR to increase the accuracy of received time and the <b>robustness</b> of the data stream {{in the presence of}} noise.|$|E
25|$|The first Austro-Daimler six-cylinder {{engine was}} {{designed}} by Dr-Ing Ferdinand Porsche to be an aircraft engine from the outset. Of high quality manufacture the Austro-Daimler was modestly rated at relatively low rpm, which gave the engine family a reputation for <b>robustness</b> and reliability.|$|E
25|$|Adaptive control uses on-line {{identification}} of the process parameters, or modification of controller gains, thereby obtaining strong <b>robustness</b> properties. Adaptive controls were applied {{for the first time}} in the aerospace industry in the 1950s, and have found particular success in that field.|$|E
25|$|Software {{structural}} quality {{refers to}} how it meets non-functional requirements that support the delivery of the functional requirements, such as <b>robustness</b> or maintainability. It {{has a lot more}} to do with the degree to which the software works as needed.|$|E
25|$|Mainly, the {{sidelobe}} {{levels of}} W-OFDM are lower. This results in less ICI, {{as well as}} greater <b>robustness</b> to narrowband interference. These two properties are especially useful in PLC, {{where most of the}} lines aren't shielded against EM-noise, which creates noisy channels and noise spikes.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{procedures}} {{have been developed for}} parameter estimation and inference in linear regression. These methods differ in computational simplicity of algorithms, presence of a closed-form solution, <b>robustness</b> with respect to heavy-tailed distributions, and theoretical assumptions needed to validate desirable statistical properties such as consistency and asymptotic efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The <b>robustness</b> of an {{emergency}} management plan is dependent on how much money an organization or business can place into the plan. The organization must balance realistic feasibility {{with the need to}} properly prepare. In general, every $1 put into {{an emergency}} management plan will prevent $7 of loss.|$|E
25|$|Axiomatic {{design is}} a top down {{hierarchical}} functional decomposition process used as a solution synthesis framework for the analysis, development, re-engineering, and integration of products, information systems, business processes or software engineering solutions. Its structure is suited mathematically to analyze coupling between functions in order to optimize the architectural <b>robustness</b> of potential functional solution models.|$|E
25|$|It is {{complete}} because (for a given choice of model and prior distribution) {{the solution is}} often clear and unambiguous. It allows for the incorporation of prior information when available to increase the <b>robustness</b> of the solutions, as well as taking into consideration the costs and risks {{that are associated with}} choosing alternate decisions.|$|E
25|$|Process Window Index (PWI) is a {{statistical}} measure that quantifies the <b>robustness</b> of a manufacturing process, e.g. one which involves heating and cooling, {{known as a}} thermal process. In manufacturing industry, PWI values are used to calibrate the heating and cooling of soldering jobs (known as a thermal profile) while baked in a reflow oven.|$|E
25|$|Formal {{methods are}} a {{particular}} kind of mathematics based techniques for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems. The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and <b>robustness</b> of a design.|$|E
25|$|Pairwise {{reaction}} deletion of {{all possible}} pairs of reactions is useful when looking for drug targets, as it allows the simulation of multi-target treatments, either by a single drug with multiple targets or by drug combinations. Double deletion studies can also quantify the synthetic lethal interactions between different pathways providing {{a measure of the}} contribution of the pathway to overall network <b>robustness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Electrification's {{advantages}} were {{reflected in}} the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project <b>robustness</b> against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.|$|E
