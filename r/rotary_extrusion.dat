Nowadays, due to the European policy of increasing efficiency in raw material and energy usage, the metal forming sector is demanding new innovative technologies. In this context, <b>rotary</b> <b>extrusion</b> technology is a very promising metal forming alternative to the drilling techniques after forging processes. The presented work is focused on hollow shafts that are usually manufactured using a combination of forming and metal cutting techniques. Deep drilling is the most common technique to obtain internal holes in the automotive hollow parts, but it is an expensive process in terms of material usage. In this framework, <b>rotary</b> <b>extrusion</b> appears as an alternative technology that leads to the reduction of material usage and process time. The tubular shape is formed with the combination of two forming processes: flow forming and backward extrusion. This paper presents the development of a simulation methodology, the process design for a hollow part, the specifications of the experimental unit, and the manufactured prototypes in order to validate the simulation model. Also the incremental process is improved thanks to a sensitivity study of the rollers geometry. <b>Rotary</b> <b>extrusion</b> experiments are done using a modified flow forming machine and 20 % material saving is achieved when obtaining the deep hole in comparison to the current deep drilling technology.

40|$|The {{results of}} studies {{carried out on}} the heat treated AZ 61 {{magnesium}} alloy extruded by two methods, i. e. direct extrusion and continuous <b>rotary</b> <b>extrusion,</b> were presented. As part of the work, parameters of the T 6 heat treatment were proposed and aging curves were plotted. The solution heat treatment process was accompanied by the grain growth. During artificial aging, due to the decomposition of solid solution, the β-Mg 17 Al 12 phase was precipitated from the supersaturated α solution. It precipitated in a coagulated form at the grain boundaries and {{in the form of}} fine-dispersed plates arranged in a preferred direction relative to the grain orientation. Rods obtained by continuous <b>rotary</b> <b>extrusion,</b> unlike those made by the direct process, exhibited a low degree of texturing and lack of anisotropic properties...|$|E
5000|$|Twisties {{are also}} {{sold on the}} Italian market with the name ''''Fonzies''''. [...] Fonzies are pale yellow in colour, {{because they do not}} use the bright orange food {{colouring}} that normal Twisties use. As well as this, they are easier to chew because they're baked, unlike its Australian inspiration which is fried. Their cheese flavouring is very similar to that used in the Oceanian varieties bearing the 'Twisties' name, lighter and less prone to clump together during consumption, and with a more natural cheese flavour. The only quality that differentiates it from said varieties is its slight egg-like taste upon first bite, though it wears away after continued consumption. It is made through the same <b>rotary</b> head <b>extrusion</b> technique as in all other localisations, though the snacks are much smaller than those found in Australia, sticking more to a general thin shape rather than a selection of both thin and stout snacks. Its smell is much more pungent, as well. Fonzies are available in 'Gli Originali' ('Original') flavour, as well as 'Time Out', 'Choco', 'Hot Passion', 'Bacon','Hot Chili' and others.|$|R
40|$|In a {{cooperative}} program with industrial superconducting wire manufacturers {{for the purpose}} of studying billet preparation and extrusion, a total of twenty billets were assembled. Fourteen of these contained no superconductor but were ''dummy'' billets to evaluate methods of stacking to achieve the best packing density. These billets were not extruded but were sectioned transversely and longitudinally for evaluation of billet preparation techniques. The remaining six billets were assembled with NbTi stacking elements in a copper/copper nickel matrix using a standard conductor configuration. Two of these billets were instrumented with thermocouples and used to evaluate preheating techniques. The other four were extruded and drawn to finished conductor size for critical current measurement. This study showed that hexagonal stacking elements, contoured billet jackets and hot isostatic pressing resulted in high density uniform billets for <b>extrusion.</b> <b>Rotary</b> forging was found to be unacceptable for billet compacting. Fast billet heating was achieved in both the salt bath and by induction heating, but the induction method gave a more uniform temperature distribution during the heating cycle. Asymmetry from poor packing density in the billet resulted in nonuniform filament size distributions and poor critical current performance. Billet yield was increased as much as 16 percent by contouring the stacking element positions within the billet. (auth...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the methods}} to produce {{aluminium}} alloys of an uncommon composition and structure is by the combined process of casting with rapid solidification and the following plastic forming. When modern advanced methods of rapid cooling of the melt are used, the alloy structure solidifies as a powder in the atomiser or as ribbons when cast onto a rapidly rotating copper wheel. If optimum conditions for the process of casting and rapid consolidation are satisfied, {{it is possible to}} control some structure parameters like the size of the particles, the size of the precipitates, etc. Additionally, the production of aluminium alloys by rapid solidification allows introducing the alloying constituents that are incompatible with the state of equilibrium. The consolidation of material made by rapid solidification is achieved in one of the numerous variations of the plastic forming processes, among which the most commonly used are the direct extrusion and continuous <b>rotary</b> <b>extrusion</b> (CRE). This paper presents the results of the consolidation in the process of continuous <b>rotary</b> <b>extrusion</b> (CRE) of selected aluminum alloys with an unusually high content of alloying elements cast in the process of rapid solidification by melt spinning and crushed in a high-speed cutting mill to as ”chips”...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aiming {{to explain}} forming {{mechanism}} of copper pipe workpiece with inner straight groove via ball-rolling at different spinning speeds, the copper pipe workpiece and straight die is modeled in ABAQUS. And the whole simulation includes forming process, analysis of strain and stress. It is concluded {{that in the}} process of ball-rolling, the deformation of copper pipe workpiece is mainly the axial and teeth groove radial; with <b>rotary</b> <b>extrusion</b> increasing, the equivalent strain and stress enlarge gradually. Under the premise of keeping the quality of production, the maximum spinning speeds is 24000 r/min, which will not lose steady and complete the whole operation successfully. The simulation data and conclusion supply the basis for the actual processing...|$|E
40|$|Continuous <b>rotary</b> <b>extrusion</b> (CRE) is {{the more}} and more {{frequently}} used variation of the plastic working process. Magnesium alloys, due to its properties are becoming increasingly popular {{as a substitute for}} aluminium alloys and steel, particularly in the aerospace and transportation industries. The main aim {{of this study was to}} optimize the parameters of the CRE process for selected commercial magnesium alloys such as AZ 81 and AZ 91. Extruded in CRE process rods were subjected to visual observations, microstructure examination, and testing of mechanical properties. Basing on the CRE test results and studies, parameters enabling successful execution of the process were specified. It was found that the greatest impact on the extrusion process has the die temperature, and it can be controlled mainly by adjustment of other CRE parameters (eg. process speed) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to investigate the role of cold rolling on the foaming ability (or foamability) of aluminium precursors, made by continuous <b>rotary</b> <b>extrusion,</b> a process performed at elevated temperature, starting by powder. For this purpose, the effect of different parameters including initial shape of precursors, rolling direction, amount of deformation in each rolling pass and final thickness of rolled specimens are experimentally investigated. Furthermore, the foaming efficiency of both rolled precursors and as-received extruded ones is compared. To clarify the role of secondary processing operations on the foaming efficiency, precursor samples are prepared following different forming and machining process chains, before the final foaming operation. Finally, hardness tests are performed on as-received precursors and rolled samples to notice the correlation between rolling parameters, state of strain, foaming efficiency and hardness. The results of the study show that: (a) cold rolling considerably improves foamability, (b) rectangular precursor bars have higher foaming efficiency than round ones, both before and after cold rolling. Besides, the improvement in foamability due to cold rolling is greater if precursors are rolled in the extrusion direction, rather than the orthogonal direction. © 2013 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.
