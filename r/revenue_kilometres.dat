The former included Douglas DC-3 Dakota/C-47 Skytrain, DC-4/C-54 Skymaster and DC-6 piston airliners {{as well as}} more modern Bristol Britannia and Vickers Viscount turboprops. These continued serving the all-economy Safari and colonial coach class (British residents only) routes to East, Central, Southern and West Africa pioneered by both Airwork and Hunting-Clan, as well as operating trooping flights from Stansted under contract to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and assorted passenger and freight charter flights these airlines and their associates had provided. During its first year of operation, the BUA group's 90-strong fleet flew 17.8 million revenue miles (28.6 million <b>revenue</b> <b>kilometres),</b> carrying 631,030 passengers, 143 million pounds (lb) (64,867 [...] tonnes (t)) of freight and 25,749 cars (carried by Channel Air Bridge).|$|E
40|$|M. Com. (Transport Economics) The {{relative}} importance of road transportation cannot be over-emphasised. As at 30 June 1981 the number of licenced commercial vehicles registered in South Africa was 855 450. Freight transport for reward during 1975 was conducted by 5 588 differen t op era tors throughout South Africa. During 1981 a total mass of 239 576 000 metric tons was transported by professional freight carriers. The total <b>revenue</b> <b>kilometres</b> travelled amounted to 646 332 000 kilometres. Control over road transportation in South Africa is carried out in accordance to the regulations as stipulated in the Road Transportation Act (Act 74 of 1977) and the Road Traffic Ordinance and Regulations (Number 21 of 1966). The aim of the Road Transportation Act is to regulate, in an orderly manner, the economic aspects related to road transport {{and to ensure that}} the misallocation of resources are restricted to a minimum. An analysis of the nature and magnitude of regulation in South Africa indicates that during 1983 / 84 permits were issued to approximately 12 percent of all registered commercial vehicles. The statistics clearly indicate that economic regulation has a meaningful affect on the road transportation industry. The aim {{of this study is to}} research the practical implications of economic regulation practices in South Africa. A further aim of the study is to determine to what extent decisions are based on meaningful information and whether it is in line with acceptable theoretical principles. The reason for a research and analysis of this nature is related to the fact that economic regulation leads to high administrative costs for the responsible authorities...|$|E

30|$|Yield {{management}} is the assortment of schemes, strategies and tactics the airline enterprises use to systematically manage demand {{for their services}} and products [25]. The fundamental units for yield management are load factors, pricing and cost of the airlines [26]. Passenger load factor (or only load factor) {{is a measure of}} the degree of airline passenger carrying capacity. The load factor is a quantity of the extent to which supply and demand are balanced at prevailing prices [18]. In short, load factor is defined as the ratio of the <b>revenue</b> passenger <b>kilometre</b> to available seat kilometre in the given origin destination flight [14, 4].|$|R
40|$|Workshop DIn 1999 the Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} the county should {{introduce}} so-called ”quality contracts” for public transport in the county. The main idea {{of this type of}} contract is that decisions on the level of service (routes and frequencies) are left to the operators while the fares are subject to regulation by the county. A basic ingredient of such contracts should be a remuneration scheme linked to the level of service. The purpose of the remuneration is to internalise the impacts on consumers’ surplus caused by changes in the level of service. This impact is inadequately captured by the changes in fare revenue. Theory gives some guidance with respect to the principle of proper remuneration. A model was calibrated {{for each of the three}} main bus operators in Hordaland and used to estimate the rates of remuneration that would induce the operator to provide an optimum level of service based on maximisation of profit. Modelling indicated that the remuneration schemes should consist for fixed rates per <b>revenue</b> <b>kilometre</b> and vehicle hour of revenue service for basic services and additional peak services respectively. Due to substantial deviation between fare and marginal cost for peak passengers, two operators should also have a remuneration per peak passengers. Modelling also showed that the sum of fare revenue and remuneration per km, hour and peak passenger would imply excessive profits and that the contracts therefor should include the deduction of a fixed amount. This is a novel and promising approach to contracting for public transport services. The heavy reliance on modelling means that the stakeholders must have confidence in the model and the results produced. In year 2000, contracts were implemented in the County of Hordaland based on these principles and results from modelling...|$|R
30|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to build econometric models that can capture the variations of load factors for Europe-Middle East and Europe-Far East airline flights. The paper’s target population is airlines that are members of the Association of European Airlines (AEA). We use multivariate time series econometric model to analyse the temporal evaluation of load factor. The best well-fitted econometric model may improve the accuracy of forecasting the load factor of these specific flights. However, in order to build the best fitted model for the load factor we are encountered to several challenges. First, we need to evaluate characteristics of available seat <b>kilometre</b> and <b>revenue</b> passenger <b>kilometre</b> on the load factor. Second, we need to have solid knowledge about the autocorrelation structure of the load factor. Classically, we think that the intensity of autocorrelation of time series data diminishes with more distant lags.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to utilise an {{artificial}} neural network (ANN) to model Australia"s domestic air travel demand.

Forecasting passenger demand is a critical issue in the air transport industry and is generally viewed as the most crucial function of airline management This {{is the first time}} an ANN has been applied to domestic air travel in Australia, with ANN approaches having limited use in the industry. Two ANN models to forecast Australia&# 039;s domestic airline passenger demand (PAX model) and <b>revenue</b> passenger <b>kilometres</b> performed (RPKs model) were constructed. Quarterly data from 1992 to 2014 was used. Australia&# 039;s real interest rates and tourism attractiveness were included as candidate variables for the fast time in the models.

For model development, Australia&# 039;s real GDP, real GDP per capita, air fares, Australia&# 039;s population and unemployment, tourism (bed spaces) and 4 dummy variables, utilizing quarterly data obtained between 2002 and 2012, were selected as model parameters.

40|$|Revenue {{management}} is a thoroughly researched {{field of study}} and it is widely used in several different industries. The Revenue Management Department at the airline SAS (Scandinavian Airline System) serves to maximise the profit of the company’s flights. At their disposal they {{have a number of}} tools, which use KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) as a measurement. The KPIs are used in prognosis to determine future initiatives, and to analyse and verify results. SAS does not know if the KPIs they focus on to measure performance are the most relevant for optimisation of revenue for their flights. In an attempt to simplify the use of SAS’ optimisation system we have performed a correlation analysis on a set of selected KPIs and assessed the influence relationships between these KPIs, in order to identify pivotal KPIs. Furthermore, we have researched origindestination control and the network effect to broaden the scope of the investigation. We have presented the work and the results in this thesis. The correlation analysis was performed using data, spanning a two-year period, for domestic flights (within Sweden) provided by SAS. The results of the analysis showed that the assessed KPIs could be divided into three groups; within each group the KPIs are closely correlated. As a result, we concluded that to focus on one KPI in each group should be adequate for evaluating performance. The three pivotal KPIs are <b>revenue</b> passenger <b>kilometre,</b> cabin factor and revenue per available seat kilometre. We have recommended SAS to continue working with origin-destination control and that the pivotal KPIs should be used as a measurement for the network, as well as measurements such as net leg revenue. Additionally, we have suggested that SAS conducts equivalent or similar analyses in other suitable areas to identify or confirm pivotal KPIs...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pervasive}} trends in the global airline industry {{over the past few}} three decades has been the rapid development of low cost carriers (LCCs). Australia has not been immune to this trend. Following deregulation of Australia&rsquo;s domestic air travel market in the 1990 s, a number of LCCs have entered the market, and these carriers have now captured around 31 per cent of the market. Australia&rsquo;s LCCs require reliable and accurate passenger demand forecasts as part of their fleet, network, and commercial planning and for scaling investments in fleet and their associated infrastructure. Historically, the multiple linear regression (MLR) approach has been the most popular and recommended method for forecasting airline passenger demand. In more recent times, however, new advanced artificial intelligence-based forecasting approaches &ndash; artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithm (GA), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) - have been applied in a broad range of disciplines. In light of the critical importance of passenger demand forecasts for airline management, as well as the recent developments in artificial intelligence-based forecasting methods, the key aim of this thesis was to specify and empirically examine three artificial intelligence-based approaches (ANNs, GA and ANFIS) as well as the MLR approach, in order to identify the optimum model for forecasting Australia&rsquo;s domestic LCCs demand. This {{is the first time that}} such models &ndash; enplaned passengers (PAX) and <b>revenue</b> passenger <b>kilometres</b> performed (RPKs) &ndash; have been proposed and tested for forecasting Australia&rsquo;s domestic LCCs demand. The results show that of the four modeling approaches used in this study that the new, and novel, ANFIS approach provides the most accurate, reliable, and highest predictive capability for forecasting Australia&rsquo;s LCCs demand. A second aim of the thesis was to explore the principal determinants of Australia&rsquo;s domestic LCCs demand in order to achieve a greater understanding of the factors which influence air travel demand. The results show that the primary determinants of Australia&rsquo;s domestic LCCs demand are real best discount airfare, population, real GDP, real GDP per capita, unemployment, world jet fuel prices, real interest rates, and tourism attractiveness. Interestingly three determinants, unemployment, tourism attractiveness, and real interest rates, which have not been empirically examined in any previously reported study of Australia&rsquo;s domestic LCCs demand, proved to be important predictor variables of Australia&rsquo;s domestic LCCs demand. The thesis also found that Australia&rsquo;s LCCs have increasingly embraced a hybrid business model over the past decade. This strategy is similar to LCCs based in other parts of the world. The core outcome of this research, the fact that modelling based on artificial intelligence approaches is far more effective than the traditional models prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), means that future work is essential to validate this. From an academic perspective, the modelling presented in this study offers considerable promise for future air travel demand forecasting. The results of this thesis provide new insights into LCCs passenger demand forecasting methods and can assist LCCs executives, airports, aviation consultants, and government agencies with a variety of future planning considerations...|$|R
