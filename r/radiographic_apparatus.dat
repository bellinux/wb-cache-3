40|$|Introduction & Objective: During {{the most}} dental procedures, {{contamination}} of devices with blood, saliva and other body fluids, {{which is the}} most important factor for transmission of infectious diseases, is inevitable. Therefore principles of infection control should be carefully considered in the dentistry. The {{purpose of this study was}} the evaluation of bacterial contamination of active <b>radiographic</b> <b>apparatus</b> in dental centers of Hamadan city in year 2003. Materials & Methods : In this cross-sectional study 37 <b>radiographic</b> <b>apparatus</b> in dental centers of Hamadan were evaluated. Samples were collected from four area (25 cm 2 each) that are frequently touched by dentists, personnel, etc. using a swab. The swab was inserted into the carrier media containing thioglycolate, a smear was obtained from the solution and remaining solution was cultured in blood agar. Smear and blood agar cultures were transferred to microbiology lab to determine bacterial contamination level as well as bacterial typing. According to WHO criteria the area which has more than 10 microorganism/cm 2 is considered as contaminated. Results: It was found that 13 of radiographic apparatus(35 %) were contaminated, the most frequent bacterial type detected in this study was micrococcus (75. 7 %) and the least were enterobacter and nocardia (2. 7 % each). Antiseptic materials used for decontamination of the devices were as follow : Alcohol (43. 2 %), Deconex (32. 4 %), Micro 10 (18. 9 %), Savlon (10. 8 %), Hypochlorid (5. 4 %), Glutaraldehyde (2. 7 %). Conclusion: Based on the results (35 % bacterial contamination) it can be concluded that careful performance of infection control principles, daily decontamination of devices and offering periodic instructions for dental personnel are essential...|$|E
40|$|Damage of {{reinforced}} concrete in structures like bridges and highways {{is related to}} factors like environmental aggression, service loads, construction technologies and, exceptionally, seismic events. Chemicals and physical agents may induce a gradual increase in the concrete porosity and permeability, causing loss of the material integrity. In bridge decks, damage is also dependent on low fatigue level due to cyclic loads, on thermal loads and corrosion of steel bars. The object {{of the present study}} is a viaduct of the Orte-Ravenna highway, built in the first seventies. The {{reinforced concrete}} slab of the viaduct exhibited serious structural deficiencies and, therefore, was destined to demolition and subsequent reconstruction. Parts of the removed slab were carried to the Ferrara University Laboratories in order to evaluate the concrete damage level and to assess a possible strengthening technique for repair. In the paper, the investigation results are reported. The investigation consists of non destructive evaluation as well as experimental tests on concrete specimens. At the structural scale a thermography is carried out in order to observe homogeneity of concrete and to point out anomalous zones with cracks, cavities or incoherent aggregates. Thermography is based on the emission of thermic radiation and, according to Wien law, the range of medium and far IR (2 - 15 Î¼m) turns out to be suitable to characterise thermic emission of objects at ambient temperature. Surface temperature difference corresponds to different intensity of infrared rays and this produces, in the <b>radiographic</b> <b>apparatus,</b> contrast of the thermographic image. At the specimen scale, the investigation is carried out by mercury porosimetry, compression test, three-point bending test, ultrasound measurements, scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyser. Concerning the strengthening techniques, the application of fibre reinforced polymers (FRP) is considered. In particular, the problem of fibre debonding and concrete cover separation, in the presence of damaged concrete, is addressed and experimental results are reported showing the effectiveness of different practical approaches to improve the composite-concrete interface...|$|E
40|$|In routine applications, {{information}} about the photon flux of x-ray tubes is obtained from exposure measurements and cataloged spectra. This approach relies mainly {{on the assumption that}} the real spectrum is correctly approximated by the cataloged one, once the main characteristics of the tube such as voltage, target material, anode angle, and filters are taken account of. In practice, all this information is not always available. Moreover, x-ray tubes with the same characteristics may have different spectra. We describe an apparatus that should be useful for quality control in hospitals and for characterizing new <b>radiographic</b> systems. The <b>apparatus</b> analyzes the spectrum generated by an x-ray mammographic unit. It is based on a commercial CZT produced by AMPTEK Inc. and a set of tungsten collimator disks. The electronics of the CZT are modified so as to obtain a faster response. The signal is digitized using an analog to digital converter with a sampling frequency of up to 20 MHz. The whole signal produced by the x-ray tube is acquired and analyzed off-line in order to accurately recognize pile-up events and reconstruct the emitted spectrum. The energy resolution has been determined using a calibrated x-ray source. Spectra were validated by comparison of the HVL measured using an ionization chamber...|$|R
