40|$|This paper {{presents}} Forma, a practical, safe, {{and automatic}} data <b>reshaping</b> framework that reorganizes arrays to improve data locality. Forma splits large aggregated data types into smaller ones to improve data locality. Arrays of these large data types are then replaced by multiple arrays {{of the smaller}} types. These new arrays form natural data streams that have smaller memory footprints, better locality, and {{are more suitable for}} hardware stream prefetching. Forma consists of a field-sensitive alias analyzer, a data type checker, a portable structure <b>reshaping</b> planner, and an array reshaper. An extensive experimental study compares different data <b>reshaping</b> strategies in two dimensions: (1) how the data structure is split into smaller ones (maximal partition × frequency-based partition × affinity-based partition); and (2) how partitioned arrays are linked to preserve program semantics (address arithmetic-based <b>reshaping</b> × pointer-based <b>reshaping).</b> This study exposes important characteristics of array <b>reshaping.</b> First, a practical data reshaper needs not only an inter-procedural analysis but also a data type checker to make sure that array <b>reshaping</b> is safe. Second, the performance improvement due to array <b>reshaping</b> can be dramatic: standard benchmarks can run up to 2. 1 times faster after array <b>reshaping.</b> Array <b>reshaping</b> may also result in some performance degradation for certain benchmarks.

40|$|Figure 1 : Our {{parametric}} <b>reshaping</b> technique {{allows users}} to easily <b>reshape</b> a human body in a single image (Leftmost) by simply manipulating a small set of sliders corresponding to semantic attributes such as height, weight and waist girth. We present an easy-to-use image retouching technique for realistic <b>reshaping</b> of human bodies in a single image. A model-based approach is taken by integrating a 3 D whole-body morphable model into the <b>reshaping</b> process to achieve globally consistent editing effects. A novel body-aware image warping approach is introduced to reliably transfer the <b>reshaping</b> effects from the model to the image, even under moderate fitting errors. Thanks to the parametric nature of the model, our technique parameterizes the degree of <b>reshaping</b> by a small set of semantic attributes, such as weight and height.

30|$|In {{acoustic}} multi-channel equalization techniques, such {{as complete}} multi-channel equalization {{based on the}} multiple-input/output inverse theorem (MINT), relaxed multi-channel least-squares (RMCLS), and partial multi-channel equalization based on MINT (PMINT), {{the length of the}} <b>reshaping</b> filters is generally chosen such that perfect dereverberation can be achieved for perfectly estimated room impulse responses (RIRs). However, since in practice the available RIRs typically differ from the true RIRs, this <b>reshaping</b> filter length may not be optimal. This paper provides a mathematical analysis of the robustness increase of equalization techniques against RIR perturbations when using a shorter <b>reshaping</b> filter length than conventionally used. Based on the condition number of the (weighted) convolution matrix of the RIRs, a mathematical relationship between the <b>reshaping</b> filter length and the robustness against RIR perturbations is established. It is shown that shorter <b>reshaping</b> filters than conventionally used yield a smaller condition number, i.e., a higher robustness against RIR perturbations. In addition, we propose an automatic non-intrusive procedure for determining the <b>reshaping</b> filter length based on the L-curve. Simulation results confirm that using a shorter <b>reshaping</b> filter length than conventionally used yields a significant increase in robustness against RIR perturbations for MINT, RMCLS, and PMINT. Furthermore, it is shown that PMINT using an optimal intrusively determined <b>reshaping</b> filter length outperforms all other considered techniques. Finally, it is shown that the automatic non-intrusively determined <b>reshaping</b> filter length in PMINT yields a similar performance as the optimal intrusively determined <b>reshaping</b> filter length.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we have {{analyzed}} {{the use of}} a shorter <b>reshaping</b> filter length than conventionally used in order to increase the robustness of acoustic multi-channel equalization techniques. We have analytically shown that using a shorter <b>reshaping</b> filter decreases the condition number of the (weighted) convolution matrix, increasing as a result the robustness against RIR perturbations. In addition, we have proposed to automatically determine the <b>reshaping</b> filter length as the point of maximum curvature of the parametric plot of the condition number versus the (weighted) least-squares error, such that both quantities are simultaneously kept small. Using instrumental performance measures, {{it has been shown that}} using shorter <b>reshaping</b> filters indeed increases the robustness of MINT, RMCLS, and PMINT against RIR perturbations. In addition, it has been shown that PMINT using the optimal intrusively determined <b>reshaping</b> filter length outperforms MINT and RMCLS. Finally, it has been shown that the automatic non-intrusive procedure for selecting the <b>reshaping</b> filter length in PMINT yields a nearly optimal performance, confirming the practical applicability of using shorter <b>reshaping</b> filters in acoustic multi-channel equalization.|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{decreasing}} the <b>reshaping</b> filter length in acoustic multi-channel equalization techniques decreases the condition {{number of the}} matrix being inverted, increasing the robustness against RIR perturbations. However, {{decreasing the}} <b>reshaping</b> filter length also reduces the equalization performance {{with respect to the}} true RIRs, resulting in a trade-off between equalization performance for perfectly estimated RIRs and robustness in the presence of RIR perturbations. Using a shorter <b>reshaping</b> filter is not only desirable to increase the robustness against RIR perturbations, but also because of the lower computational complexity of the <b>reshaping</b> filter design.|$|R

30|$|In this section, we {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the <b>reshaping</b> filter length on the dereverberation performance of all considered acoustic multi-channel equalization techniques. In Section 6.1, the considered acoustic systems, instrumental performance measures, and algorithmic settings are introduced. In Section 6.2, the increase in robustness when using shorter <b>reshaping</b> filter lengths is investigated. In Section 6.3, the performance of all considered equalization techniques using the intrusively determined <b>reshaping</b> filter length L^opt_g is compared for several acoustic systems and RIR perturbation levels. In Section 6.4, the performance of PMINT using the automatic non-intrusively determined <b>reshaping</b> filter length L^auto_g is investigated.|$|R
30|$|The optimal <b>reshaping</b> filter length L^opt_g {{yielding}} {{the highest}} dereverberation performance obviously {{depends on the}} acoustic system and the RIR perturbation level.

The optimal <b>reshaping</b> filter length L^opt_g can then be selected by comparing the different output signals to the clean reference signal. Since one typically does {{not have access to}} the clean reference signal, an automatic non-intrusive procedure is required in practice.|$|R
30|$|The {{length of}} the <b>reshaping</b> filters in MINT, RMCLS, and PMINT is {{conventionally}} chosen such that perfect dereverberation can be achieved for perfectly estimated RIRs. As already mentioned, since in practice the available RIRs typically differ from the true RIRs, this choice of the <b>reshaping</b> filter length yields a high sensitivity to RIR perturbations. In [33], it has been analytically shown that decreasing the <b>reshaping</b> filter length increases the robustness for MINT and PMINT only if the multi-channel convolution matrix of the RIRs is a square matrix. In this paper, it is analytically shown that decreasing the <b>reshaping</b> filter length increases the robustness of MINT, RMCLS, and PMINT independently of the dimension of the (weighted) multi-channel convolution matrix of the RIRs. A mathematical relationship between the <b>reshaping</b> filter length and the condition number of the (weighted) multi-channel convolution matrix of the available RIRs, hence, the sensitivity of equalization techniques to RIR perturbations, is derived. We show that shorter <b>reshaping</b> filters than conventionally used yield a smaller condition number, i.e., a higher robustness against RIR perturbations.|$|R

In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site. The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare {{combined}} poetic genius with {{a practical}} {{sense of the}} theatre. Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed.

This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama. As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however.

Sinter mix compositions were comparable to small size fractions of plant sinter mixes; as they are the first to form melt during sintering operations.
