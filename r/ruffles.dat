5|$|Now that orca {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} for several decades, the exact age of many younger whales is known. The age of older orcas, such as Granny, is estimated by their offspring; they give birth around age 15, and stop having offspring around 40; by adding the generations together, ages can be estimated. Granny was photographed in 1971 with a male orca, J1 <b>Ruffles,</b> who was believed at the time to be her son. <b>Ruffles</b> was estimated as at least 20 years old, and as scientists believed him to be Granny's last offspring, her own age was estimated at about 60. It was later discovered that <b>Ruffles</b> was not Granny's son, but her age estimate was never changed. Granny's age was originally estimated with a margin of error of 12 years, but was the subject of an academic dispute in 2016 due to her original age being based on evidence now known to be incorrect, as well as a large disparity between the life expectancy of orcas with estimated ages and orcas with known ages. Analysis of fatty acids from a recent biopsy of Granny indicated that Granny may have only been 65-80 years of age.|$|E

40|$|Intense, {{continuous}} <b>ruffling</b> is {{a characteristic}} of many transformed cells, but untransformed cells <b>ruffle</b> intensely only briefly after exposure to growth factors. We reported previously that cells of a normal rat kidney (NRK) cell line transformed by Kirsten murine sarcoma virus secrete their own ruffle-inducing agent(s) that cause sustained <b>ruffling</b> in either themselves or untransformed NRK cells. In the present study, we examined {{the roles of the}} transforming growth factors TGF-alpha and TGF-beta in the induction and maintenance of <b>ruffling</b> in untransformed NRK cells and observed the following: TGF-alpha caused a transient epidermal growth factor (EGF) -like response, which could be blocked by prior exposure of cells to EGF or by antiserum directed against the COOH-terminus of TGF-alpha. TGF-beta caused no <b>ruffling</b> and did not itself prolong TGF-alpha <b>ruffling.</b> A new, buffer-soluble (transferable) mediator activity produced by incubation of TGF-beta with NRK cells for 6 -h extended the duration of maximal TGF-alpha- induced <b>ruffling</b> by several-fold. This study demonstrates that TGF- alpha alone causes an EGF-like, transient <b>ruffling</b> response, but neither TGF-alpha or TGF-beta alone, nor the two together, cause transformation-associated sustained <b>ruffling.</b> Rather, TGF-alpha acts in concert with a new, TGF-beta-dependent activity. This new activity appears to inhibit normal cellular off-regulation of TGF-alpha-induced <b>ruffling.</b> Inhibition of the cellular off-regulation of a growth factor response could {{play a key role in}} the unregulated growth associated with malignancy...|$|R
40|$|KNRK cells (a normal rat kidney [NRK] {{cell line}} {{transformed}} by Kirsten murine sarcoma virus) in sparse culture exhibit a highly <b>ruffled</b> morphology, but {{the cause of}} this <b>ruffling</b> is unknown. In this study, we have demonstrated that the continuous, excess <b>ruffling</b> on KNRK cells is caused by one or more soluble agents secreted by the KNRK cells themselves. To do this study, an assay for <b>ruffling</b> responses in live cell cultures was defined, and its reproducibility was demonstrated. This assay permitted observation of the kinetics of <b>ruffling</b> responses (percentage of cells <b>ruffled</b> as a function of time after stimulation). This method was used to compare the kinetics of <b>ruffling</b> induced by insulin, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, glucose, and KNRK cell conditioned medium (CM). <b>Ruffling</b> was elicited on NRK cells by each of the polypeptide mitogens and nutrients, but, in each case, this <b>ruffling</b> subsided spontaneously within an hour. CM from KNRK cells also caused <b>ruffling</b> movements on untransformed NRK cells, but this <b>ruffling</b> continued for at least 20 h. This response was largely blocked by premixing the KNRK cell CM with rabbit IgG against rat transforming growth factor, type alpha, (TGF-alpha). KNRK cells made quiescent (<b>ruffle</b> free) by a pH shift (from 7. 4 to 8. 4) responded to insulin, glucose, and KNRK cell CM with kinetics similar to those observed for each of these factors in NRK cells. The unusual feature for the ruffle-inducing agent(s) produced by KNRK cells was that this activity was not subject, in either NRK or KNRK cells, to the cellular off-regulation that limits the responses to insulin or glucose. Thus, the continuous <b>ruffling</b> of KNRK cells is caused by their own unregulated ruffle-inducing agent or agents, which appear to include TGF-alpha. This work also demonstrates that kinetic analysis of cellular responses to exogenous factors can provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved in the normal limitation of these responses...|$|R

Simulations using the large-Q Potts model with differential adhesivity, with the simulation temperature controlling the membrane <b>ruffling</b> amplitude, agree quantitatively with the experimental results for both normal and low fluctuation sorting, providing {{strong support for the}} validity of the model. In both cases, inhibition of <b>ruffling</b> prevents large scale cell sorting...|$|R
5|$|Social {{hierarchy}} {{in western}} jackdaw flocks {{is determined by}} supplanting, fighting, and threat displaysâ€”several {{of which have been}} described. In the bill-up posture, the western jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and sleeks its plumage. Indicating both appeasement and assertiveness, the posture is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks. A bill-down posture is another commonly used agonistic behaviour. In this display, a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers, and sometimes slightly lifts its wings. Western jackdaws often face off in this posture until one backs down or a fight ensues. In the forward-threat posture, a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards. In intense versions, the bird <b>ruffles</b> its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings. This extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females. In the defensive-threat posture, the bird lowers its head and bill, spreads its tail and <b>ruffles</b> its feathers. Supplanting is where one bird moves in and displaces another from a perch-site. The second bird usually retreats without resorting to a fight. Western jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet-first and then wrestling with their feet intertwined and pecking at each other. Other individuals gather and call noisily.|$|E

Archer then discovers Reed's complicity in evidence tampering and confines him to the brig. Archer also learns that the boarders sabotaged the ship, and he orders maximum speed in order to prevent the warp core from overloading.

40|$|Insulin induced the {{formation}} of <b>ruffling</b> membranes in cultured KB cells (a cell strain derived from human epidermoid carcinoma) within 1 - 2 min after its addition.

40|$|Membrane <b>ruffling</b> of a tumour cell is {{correlated}} with its motile and metastatic behaviour. This {{study examined the}} effect of gamma linolenic acid (GLA), an anti-cancer agent, on HGF/SF induced membrane <b>ruffling</b> in the human cancer cell line, HT 115. HGF induced a rapid appearance of membrane <b>ruffling</b> which was related to increased motility and the tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation of ezrin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein. The presence of GLA significantly inhibited both the membrane <b>ruffling</b> and cell motility of the tumour cells, at sub-toxic concentrations. Western blotting revealed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin was inhibited by GLA. The translocation ezrin from cytosol and generalised areas of cell membrane to <b>ruffled</b> areas of the membrane induced by HGF/SF was also inhibited as shown by both indirect immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. It is concluded that GLA inhibits HGF/SF induced membrane <b>ruffling</b> via its effect on ezrin, and this provides a further molecular explanation for the anti-tumour action of GLA...|$|R

5|$|The {{territorial}} {{call of the}} Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah {{with the}} last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It <b>ruffles</b> its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species {{are very difficult to}} tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final noteâ€”long held to be solely recorded for the Australian ravenâ€”has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{transmission}} {{electron microscope}} methods {{were used to determine}} the response of functionally inactive avian medullary bone osteoclasts to parathyroid hormone (PTH). Egg-laying Japanese quail were used during a period of the egg cycle when medullary bone was not being resorbed for egg shell calcification and when medullary bone osteoclasts were functionally inactive. <b>Ruffled</b> borders adjacent to bone surfaces were rarely, if ever, found on these cells. 20 min after the administration of PTH, over 70 % of the osteoclast profiles had <b>ruffled</b> borders adjacent to bone surfaces. These <b>ruffled</b> borders were bounded by filamentous-rich "clear zones " and resembled <b>ruffled</b> borders found on functionally active cells.

40|$|IL- 2 {{is known}} to play a {{critical}} role in regulating T lymphocyte proliferation. We show here that IL- 2 also provokes an instantaneous and sustained membrane <b>ruffling</b> in cloned human or murine T cells as well as in lectin-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes. In the IL- 2 -induced lamellipodia, tubulin is depolymerized whereas actin is strongly polymerized, forming caps. IL- 2 -induced membrane <b>ruffling</b> is protein kinase C (PKC) independent, as judged by the absence of effects of bisindolylmaleimide, an efficient inhibitor of all PKC isoforms. The formation of lamellipodia by IL- 2 is blocked by wortmannin and LY 294002, two inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase). Moreover, expression in murine T cells of an inactive form of P 13 -kinase inhibits IL- 2 -induced membrane <b>ruffling,</b> whereas expression of a constitutively active p 110 increases the basal membrane <b>ruffling.</b> Rac is also involved in IL- 2 -induced membrane <b>ruffling</b> since an inactive form of Rac (N 17 rac) blocks the IL- 2 -induced lamellipodia, whereas the constitutive form of Rac (Val 12 rac) can also lead to membrane <b>ruffling.</b> In the signaling cascade, Rac is downstream of PI 3 -kinase since constitutive membrane <b>ruffling</b> in Val 12 rac cells is insensitive to wortmannin. Thus, through a signaling cascade involving PI 3 -kinase and Rac, IL- 2 can induce profound alterations of the T cell cytoskeleton, a phenomenon which might be of importance for T cell physiology...|$|R

40|$|Insulin and {{hepatocyte}} {{growth factor}} (HGF) induced morphologically different membrane rufflings in KB cells. Insulin-induced membrane <b>ruffling</b> was inhibited by microinjection of rho GDI, an inhibitory GDP/GTP exchange regulator for both rho p 21 and rac p 21 small GTP-binding proteins, but not inhibited by microinjection of botulinum exoenzyme C 3, known to selectively ADP-ribosylate rho p 21 and to impair its function. This rho GDI action was prevented by comicroinjection with guanosine 5 '-(3 -O-thio) triphosphate (GTP gamma S) -bound rac 1 p 21. In contrast, HGF-induced membrane <b>ruffling</b> was inhibited by microinjection of rho GDI or C 3. This rho GDI action was prevented by comicroinjection with GTP gamma S-bound rhoA p 21, and this C 3 action was prevented by comicroinjection with GTP gamma S-bound rhoAIle- 41 p 21, which is resistant to C 3. Microinjection of either GTP gamma S-bound rac 1 p 21 or rhoA p 21 alone induced membrane <b>ruffling</b> {{in the absence}} of the growth factors. The rac 1 p 21 -induced membrane <b>ruffling</b> was morphologically similar to the insulin-induced kind, whereas rhoA p 21 -induced <b>ruffling</b> was apparently different from both the insulin- and HGF-induced kinds.

The phorbol ester-induced membrane <b>ruffling</b> was morphologically similar to the rhoA p 21 -induced kind and inhibited by microinjection of rho GDI or C 3.
