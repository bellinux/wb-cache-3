25|$|Bengaluru {{began the}} defense of the I-League title on 17 January 2015 against Dempo. Bengaluru had the chance to take the lead when they were awarded a penalty in 44th minute but Sunil Chhetri could not convert to chance. The match {{eventually}} ended in a goal-less draw. The next match for Bengaluru FC was worse as they went down to Pune 1–3 in their next home game. Pune took an early 0–2 lead through Darko Nikac and Luciano Sabrosa. Pune furthered their advantage in the 82nd minute when Thongkhosiem Haokip connected well with Yumnam Raju's cross for the ball to bounce beyond the goal-line after <b>rattling</b> <b>the</b> crossbar. In the closing minutes, Bengaluru pulled one back when Eugeneson Lyngdoh scored a goal with the assist from Sean Rooney. In their next game against East Bengal, Bengaluru could not find the back of the net, in spite of dominating {{in the first half and}} creating multiple chances. In the second half, Abhinas Ruidas scored a goal for East Bengal against the run of play while Bengaluru continued to miss chances and thus game ended 1–0 in favour of East Bengal and Bengaluru's winless streak was extended to three games. However, Bengaluru finally secured the first win of the season in the away game against newly promoted, and then table toppers, Royal Wahingdoh with a dominant 4–0 win. Thoi Singh scored a brace, while Eugeneson Lyngdoh and C.K. Vineeth scored a goal each.|$|E
500|$|According to Boyd, Harrison's {{mother was}} {{particularly}} supportive: [...] "All she wanted {{for her children}} is {{that they should be}} happy, and she recognized that nothing made George quite as happy as making music." [...] An enthusiastic music fan, she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by <b>rattling</b> <b>the</b> Harrisons' windows. While pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast Radio India. Harrison's biographer Joshua Greene wrote, [...] "Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb." ...|$|E

500|$|Years later, Barnes {{wrote about}} the effect this had on his batting style. There was one angle about this change of batting {{position}} that didn't appeal to me. I am, by nature, a forcing batsman. I like to take the shine out of a bowler [...] and I love to hear the ball <b>rattling</b> <b>the</b> pickets, or soaring over the fence... My footwork was quick and I often caused delight by stepping back feet outside the leg stump and square-cutting... If I were to become an Australian Test opening batsman I would have to conform to standard. I would {{have to put up}} the shutters... And so I came to the Second Test in Sydney ready to drape myself in the gloomy colors of a Test opening batsman.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} pitch and timbre {{determination of the}} angklung, a musical instrument made entirely out of bamboo. An angklung has two main parts: the frame and <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> tubes. <b>The</b> pitch of <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> tubes can be determined using a formula that takes into consideration the length and diameter of the air resonator. This is compared with the results obtained using sound analysis with the fast Fourier transform {{as well as with}} measured results. The coupling effects of having two <b>rattles</b> on <b>the</b> pitch and timbre are investigated. It is found that the pitch of the angklung is closely related to the fundamental frequency of air resonance in the bamboo tubes of <b>the</b> angklung <b>rattles.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> pitch of an angklung can be estimated by calculating that fundamental frequency using information from the length and diameter of the closed cylinder air column of each <b>rattle.</b> <b>The</b> timbre of the angklung is also determined to be a mix of the sound output from each of its individual <b>rattles.</b> <b>The</b> timbre has an identifying characteristic of having two prominent peaks with each one corresponding to the pitch of each rattle...|$|R
