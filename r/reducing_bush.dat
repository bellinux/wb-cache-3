50|$|Bushings {{are perhaps}} the easiest things to change on a truck in order to change the feel of how it turns. Bushings are usually made of a {{polyurethane}} material, and come in varying shapes and durometers (hardness). Two of the most standard bushing shapes include barrels and cones. Barrels, having a larger shape, are often thought to have more stability and rebound whereas cones, having a more narrow shape, allow for more turn and less rebound. The durometer of the bushing also greatly influences its characteristics. a harder bushing (such as a bushing with a rating around 97A) will be much harder to turn on than a softer bushing (something around 78A). The type of washers used with the bushing can also greatly affect the bushing's characteristics. While {{it depends on the}} size of the washer, generally a cupped washer will be the most restrictive on a bushing, a flat washer will be neutral, and a flipped cup washer will be the least restrictive.Another aspect of the longboard that has an influence on bushing performance is the bushing seat on the truck. The bushing seat is the area on the hangar where the bushing makes contact. This area often has a rim to cup the edge of the bushing, adding a small amount of restriction as the bushing deforms through a turn. Some trucks have very loose or even non-existent bushing seats, whereas others have very restrictive <b>bushing</b> seats, greatly <b>reducing</b> <b>bushing</b> deformation. More restrictive bushing seats generally found on trucks designed with faster riding in mind as they offer more stability and lean.|$|R

40|$|Resource {{selection}} by animals influences individual fitness, {{the abundance}} of local populations, {{and the distribution of}} species. Further, the degree to which individuals select particular resources can be altered by numerous factors including competition, predation, and both natural- and human-induced environmental change. Understanding the influence of such factors on the way animals use resources can guide species conservation and management in changing environments. In this study, we investigated the effects of a prescribed fire on small-scale (microhabitat) resource selection, abundance, body condition, and movement pathways of a native Australian rodent, the bush rat (Rattus fuscipes). Using a before-after, control-impact design, we gathered data from 60 individuals fitted with spool and line tracking devices. In unburnt forest, selection of resources by bush rats was positively related to rushes, logs and complex habitat, and negatively related to ferns and litter. Fire caused selection for spreading grass, rushes, and complex habitat to increase relative to an unburnt control location. At the burnt location after the fire, rats selected patches of unburnt vegetation, and no rats were caught at a trapping site where most of the understory had been burnt. The fire also <b>reduced</b> <b>bush</b> rat abundance and body condition and caused movement pathways to become more convoluted. After the fire, some individuals moved through burnt areas but the majority of movements occurred within unburnt patches. The effects of fire on bush rat resource selection, movement, body condition, and abundance were likely driven by several linked factors including limited access to shelter and food due to the loss of understory vegetation and heightened levels of perceived predation risk. Our findings suggest the influence of prescribed fire on small mammals will depend on the resulting mosaic of burnt and unburnt patches and how well this corresponds to the resource requirements of particular species...|$|R

40|$|Invasive {{species are}} a common feature of urban edges and pose a {{significant}} threat to biodiversity globally. While {{it is well known}} that urban edges provide a point of incursion for invasive species into bushland, there is poor understanding of the effect this has on native wildlife. In this thesis I explored bush rat Rattus fuscipes responses to two invasive species, the weed lantana Lantana camara, and the black rat Rattus rattus at the urban edge. Using a multi-scaled and mechanistic approach, I examined bush rat population abundance and demographic patterns in weedy urban edge, weedy core and core macrohabitat types and used a Giving Up Density experiment to examine perceived predation risk in weedy and native habitat. I demonstrated that urban edges were poor quality habitat for bush rats, and found that dense lantana functioned as a buffer, apparently ameliorating other deleterious edge effects. Lantana <b>reduced</b> <b>bush</b> rat Perceived Predation Risk (PPR), however plant structure was more important than species as a predictor of PPR. I then explored whether competition from black rats explains poor habitat quality for bush rats at the urban edge. Contrary to prediction there were no negative associations in population abundance between black and bush rats which co-existed at several sites. This lack of evidence for inter-specific competition may be explained by the patchy distribution of black rats in the study area, or the presence of lantana which may have reduced competition by providing visual and physical barriers, facilitating co existence. My results demonstrate that invasive species do not always have a negative impact on fauna at urban edges in Australia, and in fact may enhance habitat quality at certain ecological scales. Further work into the mechanistic basis for the nature of the interactions between native and alien species at urban edges is warranted in order to balance the competing consequences of the management of entrenched alien species...|$|R

Winter grazing by hares prevented the shrub Atriplex portulacoides from spreading in younger {{parts of the}} salt marsh. Clipping experiments showed that Atriplex had poor recovery after removal of aboveground tissue, which makes Atriplex vulnerable for hare attack. Once Atriplex swards were cut to the ground to mimic hare grazing, Brent Geese visited those sites {{more than twice as}} frequently than untouched control plots.

Vulnerability of Atriplex to hare grazing and the high food intake of geese are key elements to this facilitative pattern.

The Australian Dung Beetle Project sought, therefore, to introduce species of dung beetle from South Africa and Europe (which had co-evolved alongside bovids) in order to improve the fertility and quality of cattle pastures.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the sedentarization process in Filtu Woreda of the Somali Region in Ethiopia. Sedentarization is {{described}} as {{the transition from a}} more nomadic to a less nomadic or sedentary livelihood for pastoralists. In Filtu Woreda, this transition is occurring due to many reasons, among them drought, pressure from governments, and demand for education and development. The sedentarization process has, however, both positive and negative impacts on the pastoral livelihoods. In terms of Health, the sedentary life has enabled pastoralists to access health services, water and sanitation facilities, but it has also increased the risks of disease transmission and poorer nutrition. When sanitation facilities, health services and safe water quality lack in settled communities the consequences can be fatal. In terms of Ecology, the sedentarization process naturally leads to higher density of humans and animals, and thus often higher pressure on pastures in the same area. In Filtu Woreda, the respondents linked the increased density to <b>reduced</b> grass, <b>bush</b> encroachment and less rainfall, although no direct connection between these factors is documented in this thesis. Sedentarization had also enabled the pastoralists to engage more in agriculture, {{at the same time as}} this indicated a shift from a livestock-based economy with primarily home consumption to a more marked-oriented economy. In terms of Society, the sedentarization process did not seem to impact the rates of conflicts in the visited area, however examples from similar processes exemplifies the importance of awareness and carefulness when such processes are encouraged. The thesis further highlights the positive impact of education from the sedentarization process in Filtu Woreda; and the access to water which has changed pastoralists’ livelihood tremendously. Lastly, the thesis looks into the impacts on gender roles, culture, community and participation, which shows positive trends as well as further challenges. It is the impression of the researcher that the sedentarization process in Filtu Woreda is both loved and disliked among the respondents, although none of them regretted the choice to settle. It had met some demands, and created others; it had brought improvement to their livelihood, but also some challenges. These different impacts of the sedentarization process are discovered and described in this thesis in order to improve the policies and activities of development schemes targeting pastoralists in the transition from a nomadic to a sedentary life...|$|R
50|$|In 1992, ‘agri-environment schemes’ became {{compulsory}} for all European Union Member States. In {{the following}} years {{the main purpose of}} these schemes changed slightly. Initially, they sought to protect threatened habitats, but gradually shifted their focus to the prevention of the loss of wildlife from agricultural landscapes. Most recently, the schemes are placing more emphasis on improving the services that the land can provide to humans (e.g. pollination). Overall, farmers involved in the scheme aim to practice environmentally friendlier farming techniques such as: reducing the use of pesticides, managing or altering their land to increase more wildlife friendly habitats (e.g. increasing areas of trees and <b>bushes),</b> <b>reducing</b> irrigation, conserving soil, and organic farming. As the changes in practices that ensure the protection of the environment are costly to farmers, the EU developed agri-environment schemes to financially compensate individual farmers for applying these changes and therefore increased the implementation of conservation agriculture. The schemes are voluntary for farmers. Once joined, they commit to a minimum of five years during which they have to adopt various sustainable farming techniques.According to the Euro-stat website, in 2009 the agricultural area enrolled in agri-environment schemes covered 38.5 million hectares (20.9% of agricultural land in the 27 member states of the EU at the time) (Agri-environmental indicator 2015). The European Commission spent a total of €3.23 billion on agri-environment schemes in 2012, significantly exceeding the cost of managing special sites of conservation (Natura 2000) that year, which came to a total of €39.6 million (Batáry et al. 2015). There are two main types of agri-environment schemes which have shown different outcomes. Out-of-production schemes tend to be used in extensive farming practices (where the farming land is widespread and less intensive farming is practiced), and focus on improving or setting land aside that will not be used for the production of food, for example, the addition of wildflower strips.In-production schemes (used for a smaller scale, but more intensively farmed land) focus on the sustainable management of arable crops or grassland, for example reduction of pesticides, reduction of grassland mowing, and most commonly, organic farming. In a 2015 review of studies examining the effects of the two schemes, it was found that out-of-production schemes had a higher success rate at enhancing the number of thriving species around the land. The reason behind this is thought to be the scheme’s focus on enhancing specific species by providing them with more unaltered habitats, which results in more food resources for the specific species.On the other hand, in-production schemes attempt to enhance the quality of the land in general, and are thus less species specific. Based on the findings, the reviewers suggest that schemes which more specifically target the declining groups of species, may be more effective. The findings and the targets will be implemented between 2015 and 2020, so that by 2025, the effectiveness of these schemes can be re-assessed and will have increased significantly (Batáry et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Agroforestry {{is a term}} {{which has}} only {{recently}} come into general use. It is used - and practised - most widely in tropical countries because of its advantages in optimizing production while reducing soil erosion. While the name may be new, the technique has long been practised in some countries. A groforestry covers all systems where trees are deliberately left or planted on land where crops are grown or animals grazed, and so includes pratices as diverse as shifting cultivation, taungya, the growing of shade trees in cash crops such as coffee, {{and the use of}} living fences to contain or exclude animals. The upsurge of interest in these practices over the last ten years stems from the increasing population pressures and shortages of food and fuel among poor people in many developing countries. To meet their needs, those living in the more marginal areas have been forced to shorten the time the land is left fallow, to encroach further into forested land, and to overgraze pasture. As a result, the natural soil cover has been removed and the recycling of nutrients prevented leading to soil erosion and rapid decline in crop yields. Agroforestry is seen as one way of solving these problems, since by including trees in their farming systems, farmers not only benefit from a supply of wood and other tree products but help ensure their land remains fertile and productive as well Leaf litter from the trees adds organic matter to the soil and acts as a mulch to retain soil moisture and prevent soil erosion. Deep-rooted trees may tap sources of nutrients which are {{out of the reach of}} annual crops, making them available once the leaves fall. Leguminous trees such as leucaena can also improve soil fertility more directly by nitrogen fixation. Tree roots can help bind the soil and also create channels which improve its aeration and permeability to water. A mixture of tree and annual crops of different heights provides a more complete ground cover which again helps protect the soil from erosion and makes maximum use of available sunlight. The tree cover helps moderate extremes of temperature preventing rapid heat loss from the soil at night and protecting crops from excessive heat during the day. While these environmental benefits are of great importance to the conservation of fragile ecosystems in the long term, farmers are more likely to appreciate the value of trees in their farming system if they can see more immediate rewards. Multi-purpose trees which provide fodder for stock and edible fruits or nuts, as well as fuel, timber and support for climbing vegetables are those most likely to be used. Traditional systems Traditional agroforestry systems differ in the extent of the association between tree and crop or livestock components. Amongst the most closely integrated agroforestry systems are home gardens such as those commonly found in West Java and the more humid parts of West Africa. These gardens contain an intensive mix of crops of all types so that their structure resembles the natural forest. Annuals such as rice, maize and sweet potato are among perennials such as fruit, nuts and fibres and forest trees retained to provide fuel, timber, tannins, gums and medicinal products. Fodder for small stock comes from tree leaves and the grasses which grow under the trees. In the agroforestry system known as taungya, crops are grown among young trees only until the tree canopy closes over (one to three years), so that in this case the tree-crop association is temporary. The system was developed in Burma in the 1 850 s, when foresters needed labour to help establish new plantations as teak was felled. By allowing farmers to grow crops among the trees, weed growth was controlled among crop plants and trees. This system has since spread through Asia to Africa and Latin America. In West Africa it has been used to help establish plantations of Gmelina arborea. But although the system benefits poorer farmers as well as the forester, farmers sometimes resent the restrictions imposed and the constant need to move on. As a result they have been known to damage the trees deliberately and so postpone the time when they shade out the crone. In the case of shifting cultivation, or bush fallow, trees and crops occupy the same ground in turn. Although the more valued trees may be retained during the years when crops are being grown, and the trees are never completely cleared, the association between trees and annual crops is less close than it is in other agroforestry systems. Even so in the past it shared many of the advantages of more closely integrated systems. It is only now, when increasing demands o the land have led to shorter and shorter fallow periods, and in some cases eliminated them altogether, that soil erosion and reduced fertility have become a serious problem. Because bush fallow is the dominant form of farming in Africa as well as parts of the Pacific, it is this more than anything else which has promoted the search for alternative and more sustainable agroforestry systems. For those involved in improving and developing existing systems, agroforestry demands an all-round approach very different from that found among conventionally-trained agriculturalists and foresters, so justifying the need for a new discipline with a new name. Researchers, extension workers, and policy makers concerned with agroforestry have to consider not only how these improvements will affect the sustainability of the system: they also have to take account of local laws and customs concerning the ownership of trees and land, since, for example, farmers may be reluctant to plant trees if this calls into question their rights to crop a particular area. Although agriculturists can provide information about many of the crops found in agroforestry systems, little is known about most of the trees, with the exception of those such as leucaena, some acacias, glyricidia and calliandra. Even less is know about interaction between the trees and the crop. The research possibilities seem limitless. Diagnosis and design The International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) has played a key role in developing new research approaches to cope with the complexity of the subject. Established as recently as 1978, and based in Nairobi, its main aims are to initiate, promote and support research, and to increase awareness of the benefits which agroforestry brings. With only a limited number of staff, it is fulfilling these aims admirably, acting as a catalyst for agroforestry research worldwide. To help researchers investigate existing systems, see how they can be improved, and set priorities for research, ICRAF has developed an approach it calls D & D - diagnosis and design. In the diagnosis stage researchers discuss with farmers their basic needs, such as those for food, fuel, shelter and a cash income. They examine the existing system in terms of both its productivity and sustainability. In the design stage they use their knowledge of agroforestry systems elsewhere to suggest improvements which the farmers might adopt straight away. At the same time they identify more serious problems which might be resolved by research and the development of new technology. ICRAF has also proposed that an agroforestry research network for Africa (AFRENA) be set up, linking researchers in five widely occurring agro-ecological zones, so that those with common problems can share information. Two such networks have so far been established. One links Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe which all have highland areas characterised by a hot or warm climate and a single rainy season, where the natural vegetation is miombo or savanna woodland. The second is in the hot humid lowlands of West Africa and initially involves only Cameroon. ICRAF is supporting the programme by first promoting the network approach among government departments and research institutions in the countries concerned and then offering training in appropriate research methods. The networks should help researchers establish which problems are best solved on a regional basis and which should be tackled at the local level. However ICRAF is by no means the only international centre concerned with agroforestry. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) based in Nigeria and the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) based in Ethiopia, and with an outstation in Nigeria, have for some years been testing and developing the agroforestry system known as alley cropping. Alley cropping Originally from Asia, this is one of the innovative approaches adopted to tackle the problems caused by <b>reduced</b> <b>bush</b> fallows. Food crops are grown in the alleys between the lines of trees or shrubs. The trees are cut back like a hedge while the crop is grown, but allowed to grow out and cover the soil once it is harvested. The benefits are similar to those in a traditional bush fallow, but in this case cropping and fallowing occur side by side, so allowing continuous use of the same piece of land. The researchers have confirmed that alley cropping can be adapted to Nigerian conditions, and have tested several tree species, examining how they can be established, at what height they should be pruned, and the best distance between rows. The system has now been adopted by several villages in southwest Nigeria, although researchers were horrified to discover farmers growing highly competitive crops such as yam, melon and cassava between the young trees instead of the recommended maize. However, the trees survived and the researchers realised that what mattered was that the trees could be adapted to suit the farmers' existing system, not whether they took six months or two years to establish. This example highlights the importance of considering the farmers' needs in order to simplify the research that needs to be done. Once it is established that a system works, and has advantages over the existing one, it is more appropriate to consider the range of conditions which component species can tolerate rather than under what conditions they grow best. For farmers with limited resources farming under highly variable conditions, it is the flexibility and diversity of traditional agroforestry systems which give them their strength.

40|$|Land-use/cover {{changes have}} taken place in South Eastern Tanzania with as a result a decline in natural vegetation. Land use change coupled with {{anticipated}} climate change has lead to accelerated land degradation in terms of soil erosion, loss in biodiversity and changed hydrological cycles. Changes in land use if not properly managed {{goes hand in hand with}} soil erosion. This study was conducted to assess land use/cover change and its linkage to soil erosion visavis runoff and soil loss from the major land utilization types (LUTs) in cashew cropping system under natural rainfall for the period 2008 - 2010. The overall aim of the study was to establish optimal land use management and soil and water conservation practices for soil erosion control and enhanced agricultural productivity in the cashew growing areas of South Eastern Tanzania. The LUTs include cashew orchards (grove), bare maize (BC) as well as soil management or conservation measures: bare land (BL) as a control, field with residues (CR), lemon grass strips (LG), ridges and furrows (RF) and bush fallow land (BF). These LUTs are commonly practiced in South Eastern Tanzania. South Eastern Tanzania is a major cashew nut (Anacardium occidentale L.) production area in Tanzania. More than 50 % of the production comes from the Makonde Plateau and inland plains. The Makonde plateau consists of deep highly weathered sandy soils and the inland plains consist of clayey soils. Principally the soils are suitable for cashew nut production and for cereal crops as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and finger millet (Eleusine coracana). The production of cashew nut which was introduced in the 1960 s is linked to the soil erosion in the area. There are no management practices for soil and water conservation in cashew orchards tested so far. Maize (Zea mays L) is among the cereal crops grown in cashew orchards during early stages of cashew growing and also for cashew-maize intercropping systems. So far, very little scientific information is available on the effectiness of soil and water conservation measures in this system. Maize is an important staple food as well as a cash crop in South Eastern Tanzania. In the first step of the research, land use/cover change was analyzed by comparing land-use/cover maps derived from aerial photographs of 1965 with maps derived from satellite images of 2002, where we assessed how land-use changed in six villages on the Makonde plateau, and relate these to local and global drivers. Land-use/cover changes are complex processes, which we analyzed by determining the relative net changes, losses, persistence and gains of each land-use/cover categories. From selected six villages (two representative villages for each landscape - Makonde dissected plateau, Makonde high plateau and escarpment) on the Makonde plateau occupying 13034 ha, the area under cashew orchards (grove) in 1960 s was 216 ha while in 2000 s it had increased to 3117 ha. Widespread planting of cashew trees started in the 1960 s; while the villagisation program in the 1970 s, altered settlement patterns as centrally planned villages were created. Population growth and rural development policies were major local drivers for land-use/cover change; international trade and technological innovations were principal global drivers. Though population increase led to a reduction of natural vegetation, the spread of cashew trees resulted in a case of more people, more trees. Agricultural production in South Eastern Tanzania, involves conversion of natural vegetation to agricultural crops mainly cashew groves and other annual cereal crops. This land-use change has been linked to different forms of soil erosion including interrill and rill and gully erosion occurrences in the area. Assessment of the effect of major LUTs on runoff generation due to land-use during the three rainy seasons (2008 - 2010) was measured under seven treatments: cashew orchard (grove), bare maize as well as bare land as a control, maize with either residues in the field, lemon grass strips, or ridges and furrows and last but not least, bush fallow land; the latter five treatments can be regarded as soil management or conservation measures. The experiment was implemented in two sites representing the countrys most important cashew production area: Naliendele on the Makonde Pleateau and Nachingwea in the Inland Plains. Total seasonal rainfall varied from 593 to 1109 mm on the Makonde plateau and from 294 to 752 mm on the inland plains. Mean seasonal runoff coefficients (mm/mm) ranged from 0. 10 for bare land to < 0. 01 for bush fallow land; under cashew groves runoff coefficients were much higher than under natural vegetation (0. 01 to 0. 03). As a consequence of surface crusting, runoff occurs at rainfall intensities (4 - 9 mm/day) that are much lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity (119 - 833 mm/h). Though the sandy soils of the Makonde plateau are particularly sensitive to generating runoff, these soils are also more responsive to soil and water conservation measures. This insight is important for devising soil and water conservation strategies in these two contrasting landscape units. Field measured model factors are however scarce for tropical regions. We derived RUSLE factors for several soil conservation measures among the LUTs based on three seasons of field plot measurements (2008 - 2010), in two contrasting landscape units of South Eastern Tanzania, the countrys most important cashew growing area. Whereas the derived factors are useful for applying RUSLE in similar environments, this study points to the importance of understanding differences between soil types and landscape units when assessing potential soil erosion. On the Makonde plateau, rainfall erosivity was higher than on the inland plains (7130 vs 5783 MJ mm ha- 1 h- 1 year- 1). The soil erodibility K factor was higher (0. 014 t h MJ- 1 mm- 1) on the sandy Cutanic Acrisols of the Makonde plateau than on the clayey Acric Ferralsols (0. 006 t h MJ- 1 mm- 1) of the inland plains. Likewise, soil loss on the Makonde plateau was much higher than on the inland plains (e. g. for maize 33 - 127 t ha- 1 season- 1 vs 3 - 10 t ha- 1 season- 1). The differences between the C factor for maize, and for maize with crop residues, as well as the differences between the P factors for lemon grass strips and ridges and furrows indicate that although soils of the Makonde plateau are more susceptible to soil erosion, these soils are also more responsive to soil conservation measures compared to soils of the inland plains. Farmers local technique of making ridges and furrows is particularly effective. Furthermore, the C factors for cashew groves are one order of magnitude lower (0. 08 - 0. 09) than for maize, or for maize with crop residues (0. 2 - 0. 7), but are still much higher than for bush fallow (0. 001). Deforestation for agriculture hence bears the risk of increasing soil erosion rates; however, this risk can be minimised by growing cashew trees. To conclude, the dissertation shows a significant contribution towards establishing optimal soil and water conservation measures for South Eastern Tanzania. This is important in view of the fact that South Eastern Tanzania has experienced major land-use transformations over the past 50 years. Population increase and introduction of cashew trees in the 1960 s led to a massive clearing of natural vegetation and <b>reduced</b> <b>bush</b> fallow. Under this scenario soil conservation should be a priority in South Eastern Tanzania. The evaluated soil management practices are important soil and water conservation measures for sustainability of cashew nut and cereal crops production in South Eastern Tanzania. As demonstrated in the dissertation, the practice of ridges and furrows locally known as matuta can be an important part of the solution.
