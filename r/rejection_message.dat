40|$|Existing {{biometric}} identification systems, {{such as those}} used in trusted traveler programs, attempt to identify an individual’s identity from an enrollment database of n people. The output is either {{the name of an}} enrolled person, or a <b>rejection</b> <b>message</b> indicating that no match was found. Traditionally, no measure of confidence is given to the output; an individual is either granted or denied access. In this paper, we propose an extension to existing biometric systems by applying a calibration function to the n matching scores. We introduce a computationally-light calculation that can be applied either as a post-processing filter or embedded directly into an algorithm to yield perfectly calibrated probability-based scores. In addition to attaching a meaningful confidence measure to the output, the proposed methodology is also shown to improve the overall performance of a biometric system. The theoretical proof of the calibration formula is followed by its application to iris biometrics, on a data set consisting of nearly 60, 000 iris images. By comparing the detection error trade-off (DET) curves, we show that our score calibration post-processing filter reduces the area under the DET curve from 2. 41 to 0. 17, and reduces the equal error rate (EER) from 5. 40 % to 2. 84 %. ...|$|E

In particular, this study builds on work conducted in the fear appeal domain, incorporating the impact of individual differences and message design orientation on message processing. In the experiment, 343 18 to 24 year-old university students viewed three anti-drink driving advertisements in a laboratory setting. They completed measures of sensation seeking, perceived threat, perceived efficacy, attitudes towards drink driving risk prevention strategies, and behavioural intentions to engage in safe drink driving behaviours. Results provide support for a main effect of advertisement orientation on perceived threat, perceived efficacy, message acceptance and <b>message</b> <b>rejection.</b> Overall, sensory-orientated <b>messages</b> were more effective than cognitive-oriented advertisements for increasing perceived threat, message acceptance, and the <b>message</b> <b>rejection</b> behaviours relating to issue derogation and perceived manipulation than cognitive-orientated messages.

30|$|In MARIA [18], {{the authors}} {{characterize}} interference in wireless mesh networks using the well-known conflict graph based model. In this approach, the nodes exchange their flow information periodically using high power HELLO messages {{to determine their}} remaining available bandwidth based on the maximum clique constraints. The main drawback of MARIA is that these periodic exchanges of information using extended power cause high overhead in the network and in turn consume {{a part of the}} bandwidth available for data transmission. CACP [12] addresses admission control for ad hoc networks and factors both the effect of intraflow and inter-flow interference. Nonetheless, CACP has the following drawbacks: (a) CACP supports only source routing protocols like DSR [26]; (b) CACP determines the available bandwidth of all the nodes within the transmission and carrier sensing range by sending a query message to these nodes. If any node that receives the query does not have enough resources to support the flow, it sends a <b>rejection</b> <b>message.</b> This query process is performed on a hop-by-hop basis during the route discovery phase. However, this process is time consuming and imposes a high message overhead in the network which in turn consumes a part of the bandwidth available for data packet delivery [14]. PAC [14] performs admission control by relying on a passive approach to determine the available bandwidth at the interfering neighbors. Although, this approach has lower overhead, the process of estimating available bandwidth is conservative. Additionally, PAC does not give enough attention to intraflow interference. As opposed to these approaches, in [27], authors present a statistical connection admission control framework to estimate the network resource for a pair of ingress-egress nodes and make admission decision based on this estimated result. Their approach ensures a low signalling overhead-based admission control algorithm for wireless networks.|$|E

Much recent research has developed maintenance algorithms to achieve data warehouse consistency under source data updates typically by sending additional compensation-based messages to information source space. Given the highly dynamic nature of modern distributed environments such as the WWW, both source data or schema changes are likely to occur autonomously and even concurrently. Most previous solutions become invalid under this new requirement, causing both wrong query results returned from IS space or even complete <b>rejection</b> <b>messages.</b> This paper now proposes to tackle this problem from a different angle by rephasing it as a global distributed transaction problem, and develops a novel solution strategy {{that is not only}} handling this as of now unsolved problem of concurrent source shcmea changes but also added benefit is more efficient than previous solutions from the literature.

This integrated solution called TxnWrap is proven to be correct and achieve complete consistency of data warehouse maintenance even under a mixture of concurrent data updates or schema changes.

Moreover, relative to measures of message acceptance, little is known about <b>message</b> <b>rejection</b> as an outcome measure of message effectiveness. The effectiveness of a range of negative and positive emotional appeals addressing speeding were examined with drivers (N = 551). Hierarchical regressions examined the extent that measures of drivers’ pre-existing attitudes and perceived involvement, as well as gender and age, predicted the acceptance and rejection of the appeals. The results indicated that measures of pre-existing attitudes and involvement were consistently significant predictors of acceptance and, to a lesser extent, rejection of all the appeals. However, these factors explained more variance in acceptance (i. e., 36. 2 % to 53. 5 %) rather than rejection (i. e., 3. 7 % to 10. 9 %).

Nevertheless, they later propositioned that message receivers may not entirely forget the cue, yet the association between the representations of the discounting cue and the message content may fade over time and produce a sleeper effect.

The downside of greylisting is that all legitimate messages from first-time senders will experience a delay in delivery. There is also the possibility that some legitimate messages will not be delivered, if a poorly configured or designed (but legitimate) mail server interprets the temporary rejection as a permanent rejection and sends a bounce message to the original sender, instead of following the correct retry process.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 193 - 202) Non-discursive artifacts, like popular music, {{have long}} been ignored by communications and rhetorical scholars. Cultural theories and theories of consumerism often stand in their place. These disciplines ignore the functional aspects of non-discursive artifacts, resting instead on positivistic measures. Positivistic measures fail to explore how experiential meaning is exchanged between the source/rhetor/artist and the receiver/audi- tor/audience {{in regard to the}} acceptance or <b>rejection</b> of <b>messages.</b> Although the role of communications and rhetorical scholars, in viewing non-discursive artifacts, shares a similar goal [...] studying how people influence each other's predispositions, this goal requires adaptation before its application can extend toward the more modern, non- discursive, electronic modes of communication. Inclusion of experiential knowledge, or the individual world views of both the source/receiver, is an effective adaption that provides a theoretical framework for viewing non- discursive artifacts. This study investigated popular music as a non- discursive vehicle for opposing cultural hegemony (the dominant world view). By choosing symbols that construct a world view that undermines ideological images, Lou Reed and Devo engage in exhortative, subversive messages that produce semantic tension. Semantic tension occurs when an artist's world view conflicts with what is believed to be true (hegemonic) by the listener. This tension is released when the listener accepts the artist's world view, indicating an acceptance of the message. The exhortative rhetorical perspective treats each artifact as the artist's own constructed world view. In this analysis, exhortation is described as the style a rhetor uses to either create a world view or invert an existing one through artistic choices. These choices are identified using a Burkian analysis. Investigated is the framework of two distinct styles within this form, that of the band Devo and the singer-songwriter-musician Lou Reed.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} are reported identifying the circumstances In which high credibility either facilitates, inhibits, or {{has no effect}} on the communica-tor's persuasiveness in relation to a less credible source. These data pro-vide support for the cognitive response view of information processing and suggest the importance of message recipient's initial opinion as a determinant of persuasion. In experimental investigations of the persuasive ef-fect of source credibility, it has been frequently demonstrated that highly trustworthy and expert spokespeople induce a greater positive attitude toward the position they advocate than do communicators with less credibility (cf. Stemthal, Phillips, and Dholakia in press). This finding can be explained in terms of cognitive response (cf. Greenwald 1968, 1970; Petty, Ostrom, and Brock 1978). According to this formulation, a message recipient's initial opinion is an important determinant of influence. In response to a persuasive appeal, individuals rehearse their issue-relevant thoughts, as well as those presented to them. <b>Message</b> <b>rejection</b> occurs when people opposed to the communicator's advocacy review counterarguments to assertions made to the message. If a highly credible source inhibits counterarguing. whereas a less credible source does not, cognitive response predicts the su-perior persuasive power of a highly credible com-municator. Consistent with this interpretation. Cook (1969) reported less counterargumentation in response to a competent source than to an incompetent source. Despite the substantial number of studies indicating that a highly credible source is more persuasive than a low credibility source, this finding is less than univocal. • Brian Stemthal is Assistant Professor, Depanment of Marketing...|$|R

Teenoor die vaste geloof in die Dawids- en Sionstradisies, wat in besonder verwoord word in 2 Samuel 7 : 1 - 16, wat die volk onder alle omstandighede en te alle tye teen vyande sal beskerm, word die stem van die Jeremia gehoor. Jeremia pleit vir ’n terugkeer na die basiese waarhede van die Jahwistiese geloof naamlik omgee, liefde en regverdigheid en geregtigheid teenoor alle mense. Die verwerping van Jeremia se boodskap en die vasklou aan die twee ideologies gekleurde tradisies, lei direk tot die Babiloniese ballingskap wat byna die einde van die Judeërs beteken het. Ook vir die Christelike kerk is die versmelting van ideologie en teologie altyd ’n wesentlike gevaar. This {{study focused}} on two important concepts namely Theology and Ideology. Ideology {{is defined as a}} potentially dangerous set of integrated ideas according to which a certain society is supposed to be structured at all times and situations and no opposition is tolerated. Theology is defined as thoughts about God, his person, relations and acts towards people. Theology can very easily and unknowingly display certain aspects of Ideology. This point is illustrated from the history of the Judean people {{at the end of the}} Monarchical period from two texts namely 2 Samuel 7 : 1 - 16 and Jeremiah 7 : 1 - 15. Against the firm belief in the David- and Ziontraditions, which is expressed in 2 Samuel 7 : 1 - 16, which protected the Judeans against any threat and any enemy, we hear the voice of the prophet Jeremiah. Particularly in Jeremiah 7 : 1 - 15 the prophet Jeremiah is pleading for a return to the basic principals of the Yahwistic religion namely, care, love and justice to all people. The <b>rejection</b> of the <b>message</b> of Jeremiah and the choice for the two ideologically coloured traditions has led to the Babylonian exile that almost caused the end of the Judeans. This blending of ideology and theology is also potentially a big threat to the Christian church. This {{study focused on}} two important concepts namely Theology and Ideology.
