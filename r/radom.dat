5|$|Poniatowski {{spent the}} {{following}} year as an apprentice in the chancellery of Michał Fryderyk Czartoryski, then the Deputy Chancellor of Lithuania. In 1750, he traveled to Berlin. There he met the British diplomat Charles Hanbury Williams, who became his mentor and friend. In 1751, Poniatowski {{was elected to the}} Treasury Tribunal in <b>Radom,</b> where he served as a commissioner {{the following year}}. He spent most of January 1752 at the Austrian court in Vienna. Later that year, after serving at a <b>Radom</b> Tribunal and meeting with King Augustus III of Poland, he was a sejm (Polish parliament) deputy. During that Sejm his father acquired for him the title of starost of Przemyśl. In March 1753 he left on another foreign trip, this time through Hungary to Vienna, where he met Williams again.|$|E
5|$|The Union of Vilnius and <b>Radom</b> of 1401 {{confirmed}} {{the status of}} Vytautas as grand duke under Władysław's overlordship, while assuring the title of grand duke to the heirs of Władysław rather than those of Vytautas: should Władysław die without heirs, the Lithuanian boyars were to elect a new monarch. Since no heir had yet been produced by either monarch, {{the implications of the}} union were unforeseeable, but it forged bonds between the Polish and Lithuanian nobility and a permanent defensive alliance between the two states, strengthening Lithuania's hand for a new war against the Teutonic Order in which Poland officially took no part. While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched, it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania, whose grand dukes had till then been unencumbered by checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy. The Union of Vilnius and <b>Radom</b> therefore earned Władysław a measure of support in Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Between 17 and 21 July 1831 {{he crossed}} the Vistula near Osiek with his main force, and moved towards Warsaw through Gąbin and Łowicz. Meanwhile, other Russian forces from other theatres were also {{directed}} towards the city. General Gregor von Rosen's Corps (12,000 men and 34 guns) marched almost unopposed from Brześć Litewski and reached Praga on 10 August. General Theodor von Rüdiger's corps (12,000 men and 42 guns) crossed the Upper Vistula at Józefów on 7 August and captured <b>Radom.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 20 August 1831 Warsaw {{was almost}} entirely encircled by the Russians. Count Paskevich had at his {{disposal}} a formidable force. His main force on the left bank of the Vistula consisted of between 54,000 and 55,000 soldiers, supported by 324 guns of various calibres. A further 7000 soldiers and 20 guns guarded the river crossings. The II Corps under General Cyprian von Kreutz (21,000 soldiers, 90 guns) was heading towards the city from Osiek while von Rüdiger's corps was tied down around <b>Radom,</b> fighting a large Polish corps under General Samuel Różycki.|$|E
5|$|Mickl {{commanded}} the 42nd Panzerjäger Battalion of Generalmajor (brigadier) Georg Stumme's 2nd Light Division during the September 1939 invasion of Poland, {{during which the}} division was involved in difficult fighting through Kielce and <b>Radom</b> in central Poland to Modlin on the Vistula. The following month, Mickl was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class. During the winter of 1939/40, the 2nd Light Division was reclassified and converted into the 7th Panzer Division, {{in preparation for the}} invasion of France and the Low Countries. In February 1940, Generalmajor Erwin Rommel arrived to take command of the division.|$|E
5|$|On October 27, {{he signed}} with Muratbey Uşak Sportif of the Turkish Super League, for the 2016–17 season. He made his {{professional}} debut on 5 November 2016, going scoreless against İstanbul BŞB, in a Turkish BSL game. In January 2017, Auguste scored 31 points and grabbed 14 rebounds, to help his team get past Polish team Rosa <b>Radom,</b> which earned him the Game Day 11 MVP award of the Champions League 2016–17 season.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in 1766. During the Sejm in October of that year, Poniatowski {{attempted}} to push a radical reform, restricting the disastrous liberum veto policy. He was opposed by conservatives such as Michał Wielhorski, who were supported by the Prussian and Russian ambassadors, who threatened war if the reform was passed. The dissidents, supported by the Russians, formed a confederation, the <b>Radom</b> Confederation. Abandoned by the Familia, Poniatowski's reforms failed to pass at the Repnin Sejm, named after Russian ambassador Nicholas Repnin, who promised to guarantee the Golden Liberties of the Polish nobility, enshrined in the Cardinal Laws, with all the might of the Russian Empire.|$|E
5|$|In June 1976, {{a series}} of protests took place across {{communist}} Poland soon after the government announced plans to increase sharply the fixed prices charged nationwide for many basic commodities. Violent incidents occurred in Płock, <b>Radom</b> and Ursus as the protests were forcibly put down, and the planned price hikes were cancelled. These demonstrations and the events surrounding them brought the Polish workforce and intellectual political opposition together, and by 1980, a campaign of civil resistance for political change was intensifying strongly. Industrial strike action in Lublin in July 1980—the so-called Lublin July—preceded the formation of Solidarity (Solidarność) in {{the port city of}} Gdańsk during the following months. This was the first non-communist trade union in an Eastern bloc country. The government took several steps to obstruct Solidarity's emergence, enforcing press censorship and cutting off telephone connections between the coast and the hinterland, but despite these efforts four out of every five Polish workers were members of the union by late 1980.|$|E
5|$|Now often also {{considered}} a distinct species, Homo neanderthalensis (otherwise known as Homo sapiens neanderthalensis) {{lived in the}} southern half of Poland during the Middle Paleolithic period, that is between 300,000 and 40,000 BCE. Various relics were found and different Neanderthal cultures are distinguished. Acheulean handaxes from Silesia dated 200,000-180,000 years ago are among the older tools. Gatherer-hunter sporadic groups of Neanderthals penetrated southern Poland also during the Eemian interglacial, 128,000-115,000 BCE. Examination of the Micoquien-Prądnik culture (East Micoquien complex) sites in the Prądnik River Valley north of Kraków and in Zwoleń near <b>Radom</b> from about 85,000 to 70,000 BCE (early phase of the Vistula River glaciation period) shows that some Neanderthals were skilled collective hunters, able to kill numerous large mammals characteristic of the cold Pleistocene climate and process the meat, skin and bones using specialized tools.|$|E
5|$|Launched on 1 September 1939, the {{invasion}} began successfully. In Army Group South's {{area of responsibility}} under Rundstedt, the 8th, 10th and 14th Armies pursued the retreating Poles. The initial plan was for the 8th Army, the northernmost of the three, to advance towards Łódź. The 10th Army, with its motorised divisions, was to move quickly towards the Vistula, and the 14th Army was to advance and attempt to encircle the Polish troops in the Kraków area. These actions led to the encirclement and defeat of Polish forces in the <b>Radom</b> area on 8–14 September by six German corps. Meanwhile, the German Eighth Army was under attack from the north, so elements of the Fourth, Eighth and Tenth Armies were quickly redeployed with air support in an improvised attempt to cut off any Polish break-out back towards Warsaw. The flexibility and agility of the German forces led to the defeat of nine Polish infantry divisions and other units in the resulting Battle of the Bzura (8–19 September), the largest engagement of the war thus far. The conquest of Poland was quickly over, with the last Polish military units surrendering on 6 October.|$|E
5|$|The Ostrów Agreement, formalizing the {{arrangement}} and ending the civil war, was signed on August 4, 1392. Vytautas became Grand Duke and reclaimed his patrimony in Trakai while Skirgaila was compensated with the Principality of Kiev, {{where he died}} in 1397. While Vytautas was technically a vassal of Jogaila, he exercised considerable power in the Grand Duchy. His independence was legalized in the 1401 Union of Vilnius and <b>Radom.</b> Vytautas ruled Lithuania {{until his death in}} 1430; his relationship with Jogaila during these years is sometimes likened to the peaceful power-sharing demonstrated by their fathers Algirdas and Kęstutis. The Knights, betrayed for the second time, resumed their wars against Lithuania. They sought to take Samogitia, which Vytautas had twice promised them. The Treaty of Salynas was signed in 1398, leaving Samogitia to the Knights, to quiet the Duchy's western front while Vytautas was organizing a major campaign against the Golden Horde. Vytautas suffered a major defeat at the Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399. The cousins joined their forces at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, which ended the threat from the Teutonic Orders.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the German closure and censorship of Polish schools, resistance among teachers led almost immediately {{to the creation of}} large-scale underground educational activities. Most notably, the Secret Teaching Organization (Tajna Organizacja Nauczycielska, TON) was created as early as in October 1939. Other organizations were created locally; after 1940 they were increasingly subordinated and coordinated by the TON, working closely with the Underground's State Department of Culture and Education, which was created in autumn 1941 and headed by Czesław Wycech, creator of the TON. Classes were either held under the cover of officially permitted activities or in private homes and other venues. By 1942, about 1,500,000 students took part in underground primary education; in 1944, its secondary school system covered 100,000 people, and university level courses were attended by about 10,000 students (for comparison, the pre-war enrollment at Polish universities was about 30,000 for the 1938/1939 year). More than 90,000 secondary-school pupils attended underground classes held by nearly 6,000 teachers between 1943 and 1944 in four districts of the General Government (centered on the cities of Warsaw, Kraków, <b>Radom</b> and Lublin). Overall, in that period in the General Government, one of every three children was receiving some sort of education from the underground organizations; the number rose to about 70% for children old enough to attend secondary school. It is estimated that in some rural areas, the educational coverage was actually improved (most likely as courses were being organized in some cases by teachers escaped or deported from the cities). Compared to pre-war classes, the absence of Polish Jewish students was notable, as they were confined by the Nazi Germans to ghettos; there was, however, underground Jewish education in the ghettos, often organized with support from Polish organizations like TON. Students at the underground schools were often also members of the Polish resistance.|$|E
25|$|The weapon’s {{design was}} {{authored}} {{by the team}} of engineers at OBR in <b>Radom,</b> {{under the guidance of}} B. Szpaderski. The rifle was produced exclusively with a folding wire stock by the Łucznik Arms Factory in <b>Radom.</b>|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, in 1992 and 1996 Birch {{published}} twice still {{suggesting that}} meta protonation was preferred. This was {{a reversal of}} his earlier views as published with Leo <b>Radom.</b>|$|E
25|$|In October 1981, {{during a}} meeting with workers in <b>Radom,</b> two {{officers}} of the security police - {{in collaboration with the}} secret cooperant (TW) Karol - attempted to poison her.|$|E
25|$|Another ESA payload – Chandrayaan-1 imaging X-ray Spectrometer (C1XS) – {{detected}} {{more than}} two dozen weak solar flares during the mission duration. The Bulgarian payload called Radiation Dose Monitor (<b>RADOM)</b> was activated {{on the day of the}} launch itself and worked until the mission's end.|$|E
25|$|Von Wietersheim's XIV Motorised Corps {{participated in}} the Polish Campaign in 1939, where it fought at <b>Radom</b> and Warsaw, {{as well as in}} the Battle of Kock. The Corps later saw action in the Battle of France in 1940 as the Wehrmacht drove from the Ardennes to the English Channel.|$|E
25|$|As {{the only}} {{senior member of}} the non-communist opposition, he re-established the Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna), which he led from 1987. In 1989 he was elected Senator from <b>Radom</b> and {{was a member of the}} Civic Parliamentary Club (Obywatelski Klub Parlamentarny); he died during his term in office.|$|E
25|$|After poor {{tactics in}} and around <b>Radom</b> on 22 August, the {{battalion}} commander was relieved, and also implicated in the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler. He was replaced by Major Saemisch. On 1 September, 26 Tigers IIs were operational, and the battalion was assigned to XXXVIII Panzer Corps. Later in the month, the remaining company eventually joined {{the rest of the}} battalion.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 {{publications}} Birch {{collaborated with}} Leo <b>Radom</b> {{in a study}} that concluded that electron densities at the ortho and meta positions to be close with a slight ortho preference, but with mixtures of ortho and meta protonation occurring. RHF/sto-3g and UHF/sto-3g computations were used to conclude that both ortho and meta substitutions would occur with a slight preference for ortho.|$|E
25|$|During the Polish {{campaign}} I. and III. Gruppes of KG 77 {{took part}} in combat operations. Operating from Breslau-Schöngarten (today Copernicus Airport Wrocław), I./KG 77 committed 108 bombers to the campaign. Operating from Breslau under Luftflotte 4. The unit participated in the Battle of Bzura, and carried out raids {{in the areas of}} Galicia, <b>Radom,</b> Kielce and Warsaw against rail, airfield and troop targets.|$|E
25|$|Design {{work on the}} new rifle officially {{began in}} 1984 at the government-owned Ośrodek Badawczo-Rozwojowy (OBR) {{in the city of}} <b>Radom</b> {{at the request of the}} Polish Ministry of Defense (the OBR {{institute}} had already been studying a possible 5.45mm weapon since late 1980). In 1985, the weapon’s parameters were confirmed and factory tests were conducted by the end of that year. In 1986 the first batch of prototypes was fabricated for evaluation and qualification testing.|$|E
25|$|Vytautas {{was forced}} to abandon his plans to break the Union of Kreva and to ally himself once again with his cousin and King of Poland Jogaila. The Polish–Lithuanian union was reaffirmed in the Union of Vilnius and <b>Radom.</b> Vytautas also turned his plans from {{expansion}} southwards to east (against Moscow) and west (against the Teutonic Knights). It is suggested that Vytautas learned the staged retreat tactic during the battle and successfully used it himself in the Battle of Grunwald (1410), an important defeat of the Teutonic Knights.|$|E
25|$|Gierek's regime {{introduced}} wide-ranging (but ultimately unsuccessful) government {{reforms to}} revitalize the economy between 1970 and 1980. Another attempt to raise food prices resulted in the June 1976 protests. Jacek Kuroń was among the activists who defended accused rioters from <b>Radom</b> and other towns. The Workers' Defence Committee (KOR), established {{in response to the}} crackdown, consisted of dissident intellectuals willing to support industrial workers, farmers and students who were struggling with and persecuted by the authorities throughout the late 1970s. During this period, the opposition circles were emboldened by the Helsinki Conference processes.|$|E
25|$|Vytautas's {{distrust}} of Polish sovereignty over Lithuania {{may have been}} well founded, since Władysław had in principle signed Lithuania's independence away in 1385 in the formal act of union, by which he agreed to incorporate Lithuania into Poland. The Union of Vilnius and <b>Radom</b> of 1401 reaffirmed Vytautas's tenure as grand duke under Władysław's overlordship, but it assured the title of grand duke to Władysław's heirs rather than to those of Vytautas: if Władysław died without heirs, the Lithuanian boyars were to elect a new monarch. Since neither Władysław nor Vytautas had yet produced an heir, {{the implications of the}} act were unforeseeable.|$|E
25|$|Between 1956 and 1957 Lipski was {{an editor}} of the pro-reform weekly “Po prostu”; from 1957 to 1959 he was {{president}} of the Klub Krzywego Koła. In 1964 Lipski organized the Letter of the 34 (objecting the expansion of censorship in communist Poland). In 1975 he signed the Letter of 59 and in 1976 he co-funded the Workers' Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Robotnikow); {{as one of the most}} active members of this organization he organized help for the workers who protested in June 1976 against the government sponsored price increases in <b>Radom</b> and in Ursus district of Warsaw.|$|E
25|$|In January 1945, the Soviet and {{the allied}} Polish armies {{undertook}} a massive offensive, aiming at {{the liberation of}} Poland and the defeat of Nazi Germany. Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front broke out of its Sandomierz Vistula bridgehead on 11 January and rapidly moved west, taking <b>Radom,</b> Częstochowa and Kielce on 16 January. Kraków was liberated on 18 January, a day after Hans Frank and the German administration fled the city. Marshal Konev's forces then advanced toward Upper Silesia, freeing the remaining survivors of the Auschwitz concentration camp on 27 January. In early February, the 1st Ukrainian Front reached the Oder River {{in the vicinity of}} Breslau.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} {{fought to}} hold the Puławy bridgehead {{for the next few}} months. In January 1945, the division launched the Warsaw-Poznan Offensive of the Vistula–Oder Offensive from the bridgehead. On 14 January, Gusev's platoon attacked west from the bridgehead and captured the village of Paenkuv. They then advanced along the highway to <b>Radom,</b> which was captured soon after. During the subsequent fighting on the Poznań approaches and the Warta crossing, the platoon reportedly killed 250 German soldiers with its machine guns. The division then advanced to the Oder at Frankfurt am Oder. While attacking across the Grosser See lake, machine gun fire was used to facilitate the 629th Rifle Regiment's advance, allowing the reduction of German defences on the lake's western shore. For his actions during the offensive, Gusev was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 8 June.|$|E
25|$|About 700 farms were pacified, as {{the police}} used the {{doctrine}} of collective responsibility. The number of wounded is difficult to estimate, as in many situations, the peasants {{did not go to}} hospitals, fearing arrest. Nevertheless, despite the repressions, the peasants showed their strength, determination and organizational abilities. SL leaders deliberately chose not to organize the strike in the border areas of the country - Pomerania, Upper Silesia, Volhynia, and the areas of Tarnopol and Wilno, as deterioration of social situation in those strategic and vulnerable provinces, inhabited by ethnic minorities, was unwanted by them. Also, since SL structures in Mazovia, Podlasie, Greater Poland, and northern Lesser Poland (areas of Kielce, Lublin, and <b>Radom)</b> were not as strong as those in the south, the strike there was of a limited character and did not evolve into a mass protest.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffe {{took part}} in the mass killing by {{strafing}} refugees on the road. The number of civilians wounded or killed by aerial bombing is put at over 100,000. The Luftwaffe dropped thousands of bombs on urban centres inhabited only by civilian populations. Amongst the Polish cities and towns bombed at the beginning of war were Brodnica, Bydgoszcz, Chełm, Ciechanów, Kraków, Częstochowa, Grodno, Grudziądz, Gdynia, Janów, Jasło, Katowice, Kielce, Kowel, Kutno, Lublin, Lwów, Olkusz, Piotrków, Płock, Płońsk, Poznań, Puck, <b>Radom,</b> Radomsko, Sulejów, Warsaw, Wieluń, Wilno, and Zamość. Over 156 towns and villages were attacked by the Luftwaffe. Warsaw suffered particularly severely with a combination of aerial bombardment and artillery fire reducing large parts of its historic city centre to rubble. The Soviet Union assisted the Germans by allowing them to use a radio beacon from Minsk to guide their planes.|$|E
25|$|In 1399 Jadwiga of Poland and {{her newborn}} died in childbirth. Jogaila's power in Poland was jeopardised {{as he was}} a {{foreigner}} king with no other ties to the throne but his wife. Also, the defeat at Vorskla forced a re-evaluation {{of the relationship between}} Poland and Lithuania. The result was the Union of Vilnius and <b>Radom</b> in 1401. Vytautas was granted wide autonomy, but after his death the title and powers of Grand Duke of Lithuania were to be transferred to the king of Poland or vice versa. In case Jagiełło died first without an heir, the Polish nobility agreed not to elect a new king without consulting Vytautas. The unique feature of this union was that the Lithuanian nobility presented their own document: for the first time somebody other than dukes {{played a role in the}} state matters.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} Polish {{music can be}} traced {{as far back as}} the 13th century; manuscripts have been found in Stary Sącz, {{containing}} polyphonic compositions related to the Parisian Notre Dame School. Other early compositions, such as the melody of Bogurodzica and God Is Born (a coronation polonaise for Polish kings by an unknown composer), may also date back to this period, however, the first known notable composer, Nicholas of <b>Radom,</b> was born and lived in the 15th century. During the 16th century, two main musical groups – both based in Kraków and belonging to the King and Archbishop of Wawel – led to the rapid development of Polish music. Composers writing during this period include Venceslaus Samotulinus, Nicholas Zelenscius, and Mikołaj Gomółka. Diomedes Cato, a native-born Italian who lived in Kraków from about the age of five, became a renowned lutenist at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.|$|E
25|$|While dog meat is not eaten, in some {{rural areas}} of Poland, {{especially}} Lesser Poland, dog fat can be made into lard, which by tradition {{is believed to have}} medicinal properties – being good for the lungs, for instance. Since the 16th century, fat from various animals, including dogs, was used as part of folk medicine, and since the 18th century dog fat has had a reputation as being beneficial for the lungs. It is worth noting that the consumption of such meat is considered taboo in Polish culture, and making lard out of dogs' fat is illegal. In 2009, a scandal erupted when a farm near Częstochowa was discovered rearing dogs to be rendered down into lard. According to Grazyna Zawada, from Gazeta Wyborcza, there were farms in Czestochowa, Klobuck, and in the <b>Radom</b> area, and in the decade from 2000 to 2010 six people producing dog lard were found guilty of breaching animal welfare laws (killing dogs and animal cruelty) and sentenced to jail. As of 2014 there have been new cases prosecuted.|$|E
25|$|By 11 September, {{the fuel}} {{situation}} was acute, and logistics failed. On {{the first day}} his units were flying three missions every day, now it was reduced to one per day. Despite the problems, by 8 September Richthofen was preparing an assault on Warsaw for which he received Kampfgeschwader 77 (KG 77). The raids had barely begun when a major threat developed behind him. A Polish counter offensive engaged the German Eighth Army, {{in an attempt to}} reach the Vistula river. Richthofen joined the assault and counterattack from the air. For three days the Germans bombed Polish forces contributing to the success in the Battle of <b>Radom</b> and Battle of the Bzura. Richthofen sent his air units up under orders to spend only ten minutes over the battlefield, and to expend all ammunition. Polish forces sought refuge in the forests nearby, but were smoked out by incendiaries. Richthofen's men flew 750 sorties and dropped 388 tons of bombs. The air action destroyed remaining resistance, allowing the army to mop up.|$|E
25|$|After the {{war against}} Poland, the unit was {{withdrawn}} to Germany and then {{took part in the}} battle of France, as part of XIIIth Corps. Afterwards, in the summer of 1940, the division trained for taking part in the abortive invasion of England. In 1941 it participated in Operation Barbarossa as part of Army Group Center. In the fall of 1941 it took part in the Battle of Moscow. After sustaining heavy losses, it was withdrawn to France in June 1942. The division returned to the Eastern Front in April 1943, fighting around river Mius, Nikopol, Uman, Chişinău and Iaşi. In August 1944 the unit was shifted to Poland and fought to contain Soviet bridgeheads on the Vistula river, around Warka and <b>Radom.</b> It remained in this sector until it was heavily damaged {{in the course of the}} Soviet Vistula-Oder offensive in January 1945. The division was then reconstituted from its remnants and fought in April and May 1945 in the area around Görlitz. At the end of the war it was located in the Riesengebirge mountains (today Karkonosze).|$|E
25|$|The 1st Belorussian Front, to Konev's north, {{opened its}} {{attack on the}} German 9th Army from the Magnuszew and Puławy {{bridgehead}}s at 08:30, again commencing with a heavy bombardment. The 33rd and 69th Armies broke out of the Puławy bridgehead {{to a depth of}} , while the 5th Shock and 8th Guards Armies broke out of the Magnuszew bridgehead. The 2nd and 1st Guards Tank Armies were committed after them to exploit the breach. The 69th Army's progress from the Puławy bridgehead was especially successful, with the defending LVI Panzer Corps disintegrating after its line of retreat was cut off. Though the 9th Army conducted many local counter-attacks, they were all brushed aside; the 69th Army ruptured the last lines of defence and took <b>Radom,</b> while the 2nd Guards Tank Army moved on Sochaczew and the 1st Guards Tank Army was ordered to seize bridgeheads over the Pilica and attack towards Łódź. In the meantime, the 47th Army had crossed the Vistula and moved towards Warsaw from the north, while the 61st and 1st Polish Armies encircled the city from the south.|$|E
