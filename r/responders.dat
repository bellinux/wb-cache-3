5|$|In August 2010, General Motors began a {{training}} program for first <b>responders</b> when performing rescue duties involving the Chevrolet Volt. The program began at the 2010 Fire-Rescue International in Chicago, using a pre-production Volt for a live extrication exercise. Chicago firefighters demonstrated the sequence of tasks required to safely disable the vehicle’s powertrain and its 12-volt electrical system, which controls its high-voltage components, and then proceed to extricate injured occupants. , additional training workshops {{had taken place in}} several other cities corresponding to the Volt's initial launch markets. An Emergency Response Guide for the 2011 Volt was made available at its Service Technical College for use by emergency <b>responders.</b> The guide also describes methods of disabling the high voltage system and identifies cut zone information.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary and}} {{secondary}} immune response of V beta 8 + T cells to the bacterial superantigen Staphylococcus enterotoxin B was compared in BALB/c mice. Secondary <b>responder</b> T cells were found to up-regulate {{the expression of the}} adhesion molecule LFA- 1 faster, and to enter the cell cycle earlier than primary <b>responder</b> T cells. Both, {{primary and secondary}} <b>responder</b> T cells upregulate the expression of CD 2 and CD 25 and turn into blast cells with superimposable time kinetics. Secondary <b>responder</b> T cells terminate DNA synthesis, blast formation and the upregulation of CD 25 and CD 2 expression earlier than primary <b>responder</b> T cells and become more rapidly deleted. Two days after superantigen challenge, when primary <b>responder</b> T cells reach peak activity in terms of DNA synthesis and blast formation, secondary <b>responder</b> T cells have returned to the size of microblasts and ceased to replicate their DNA.

5|$|At 15:05, {{the train}} {{disappeared}} from the approach zone for the Vendenheim junction on the display being monitored by staff at the signalling control center.

At approximately the same time, one of the companies involved {{in the construction of the}} line received a call from an employee aboard the train, who informed them of the derailment. Shortly before 17:45, the local mass casualty plan was enacted. Emergency medical and fire rescue services along with 100 gendarmes responded to the incident. At its height, 104 engines from three départments responded to the incident—65 from Bas-Rhin and 39 from Moselle and Haut-Rhin. Those with minor injuries were treated by <b>responders</b> from the French Red Cross, which operated at the school in Eckwersheim. The French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, Ségolène Royal, and the Secretary of State for Transport, Alain Vidalies, travelled to the site shortly after the crash.

40|$|Conclusive {{resolution}} of an immune response {{is critical for}} the prevention of autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. We report that following co-culture with autologous CD 4 +CD 25 - <b>responder</b> T cells, human CD 14 + monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages become activated but also significantly more prone to apoptosis than monocytes/macrophages cultured alone. In contrast, in the presence of CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), monocytes and macrophages survive whilst adopting an anti-inflammatory phenotype. The induction of monocyte death requires <b>responder</b> T cell activation and cell-contact between <b>responder</b> T cells and monocytes. We demonstrate a critical role for FAS/FAS-L ligation in <b>responder</b> T cell-induced monocyte killing since <b>responder</b> T cells, but not Tregs, upregulate FAS-ligand (FAS-L) mRNA, and induce FAS expression on monocytes. Furthermore, <b>responder</b> T cell-induced monocyte apoptosis is blocked by neutralising FAS/FAS-L interaction, and is not observed when monocytes from an autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) patient with complete FAS-deficiency are used as target cells. Finally, we show that <b>responder</b> T cell-induced killing of monocytes is impaired in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our data suggest that {{resolution of}} inflammation {{in the course of a}} healthy immune response is aided by the unperturbed killing of monocytes with inflammatory potential by <b>responder</b> T cells and the induction of longer-lived, Treg-induced, anti-inflammatory monocytes...|$|R
