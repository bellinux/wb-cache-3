25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E

500|$|When Harry Manfredini {{began working}} on the musical score for the 1980 film, the {{decision}} was made to play the music only alongside the killer so as not to trick the audience into believing that the killer was around during moments that they were not supposed to be. Manfredini explains that the lack of music for certain scenes was deliberate: [...] "There's a scene where one of the girls [...] is setting up the archery area [...] One of the guys shoots an arrow into the target and just misses her. It's a huge scare, but if you notice, there's no music. That was a choice." [...] Manfredini also noted that when something was about to happen, the music would cut off so that the audience would <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> bit, which allowed the scare to become more effective.|$|E

According to the biography in [...] "Baltimore County Women, 1930-1975" [...] listed below, Jane {{had previously been}} working as a commercial artist [...] "for department stores and advertising agencies", but she [...] "gave up her career in commercial art for marriage and a family" [...] (p.16). After marrying, she signed her works consistently as [...] "Jane Frank", apparently never including a maiden name or middle initial. Her husband, a builder, constructed their home, including a studio for his wife. With the initial demands of a new marriage and family presumably beginning to <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> bit, Jane Frank returned seriously to painting in 1947 (according to Stanton, p.9).|$|E
2500|$|When Harry Manfredini {{began working}} on the musical score, the {{decision}} was made to only play music when the killer was actually present so as to not [...] "manipulate the audience". Manfredini pointed out the lack of music for certain scenes: [...] "There's a scene where one of the girls... is setting up the archery area... One of the guys shoots an arrow into the target and just misses her. It's a huge scare, but if you notice, there's no music. That was a choice." [...] Manfredini also noted that when something was going to happen, the music would cut off so that the audience would <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> bit, and the scare would be that much more effective.|$|E
2500|$|A set {{membership}} approach {{considers that}} the uncertainty {{corresponding to the}} ith measurement of an unknown random vector x is represented by a set Xi (instead of a probability density function). If no outliers occur, x should belong to the intersection of all Xi's. When outliers occur, this intersection could be empty, and we should <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> small number of the sets Xi (as small as possible) {{in order to avoid}} any inconsistency. This can be done using the notion of q-relaxed intersection. As illustrated by the figure, the q-relaxed intersection corresponds to the set of all x which belong to all sets except q of them. Sets Xi that do not intersect the [...] q-relaxed intersection could be suspected to be outliers.|$|E

6000|$|My aunt, who was {{perfectly}} indifferent to public opinion, drove the grey pony through Dover in a masterly manner; sitting high and stiff like a state coachman, keeping a steady eye upon him wherever he went, {{and making a}} point of not letting him have his own way in any respect.

She {{might or might not}} have been said to blush--perhaps the stealthy change upon her face was too slow an operation to deserve that name: but, though pale when he called, the end of ten minutes saw her colour high and wide.
