5|$|Two {{types of}} small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules– microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)– {{are central to}} <b>RNA</b> <b>interference.</b> RNAs are the direct {{products}} of genes, and these small RNAs can bind to other specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and either increase or decrease their activity, for example by preventing an mRNA from being translated into a protein. <b>RNA</b> <b>interference</b> has {{an important role in}} defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences– viruses and transposons. It also influences development.|$|E
5|$|<b>RNA</b> <b>interference</b> (RNAi) is a {{biological}} {{process in which}} RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation, by neutralizing targeted mRNA molecules. Historically, it was known by other names, including co-suppression, post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), and quelling. Only after these apparently unrelated processes were fully understood did it become clear that they all described the RNAi phenomenon. Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on <b>RNA</b> <b>interference</b> in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which they published in 1998. Since the discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials, it has become evident that RNAi has immense potential in suppression of desired genes. RNAi {{is now known as}} precise, efficient, stable and better than antisense technology for gene suppression.|$|E

5|$|Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is RNA {{with two}} {{complementary}} strands, {{similar to the}} DNA found in all cells. dsRNA forms the genetic material of some viruses (double-stranded RNA viruses).

40|$|<b>RNA</b> <b>interferences</b> in the {{unicellular}} green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, can be silenced. We {{have used}} the silencing of a transgene (aadA) that confers resistance to spectinomycin to investigate the mechanisms responsible for silencing by an artificial inverted repeat (IR) of the aadA gene. The IR construct provided strong silencing, but the RNAi efficiency varied among subclones of a single RNAi-transformed strain with successive cell divisions. Northern blot analyses revealed an inverse correlation between the copy number of the hairpin RNA and the spectinomycin resistance of the subclones. There is an inverse correlation between the efficiency of RNAi {{and the frequency of}} methylated CpG (*CpG) in the silenced region. No significant methylated cytosine was observed in the target aadA gene, which suggests the absence of RNA-directed DNA methylation in trans. Several experiments suggest the existence of an intrinsic IR sequence-dependent but a transcription-independent DNA methylation system in C. reinhardtii. The correlation between the *CpG levels and the IR transcript implies the existence of IR DNA-dependent DNA methylation. Treatment of RNAi-induced cells with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A, rapidly increased the amount of the hairpin RNA and suggests that transcription of the silencer construct was repressed by *CpG-related silencing mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|<b>RNAs</b> <b>Interference</b> plays a very {{important}} role in gene silencing. In vitro identification of miRNAs is a slow process as it is difficult to isolate them. Nucleotide sequences of miRNAs are highly conserved among the plants and, this form the key feature behind the identification of miRNAs in plant species by homology alignment. In silico identification of miRNAs from EST database is emerging as a novel, faster and reliable approach. Here EST sequences of Senecio vulgaris (Groundsel) were searched against known miRNA sequences by using BLASTN tool. A total of 10 miRNAs were identified from 1956 EST sequences and 115 GSS sequences. The most stable miRNA identified is svu-mir- 1. This approach will accelerate advance research in regulation of gene expression in Groundsel by interfering RNAs.

40|$|Germ line {{mutations}} in BRCA 2 gene predispose women to early-onset familial breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA 2 is a protein of multiple functions. In {{addition to its}} role in DNA double-strand break repair, BRCA 2 also {{plays a role in}} stabilization of stalled DNA replication forks, cytokinesis, transcription regulation, mammalian gametogenesis, centro-some duplication, and suppression of cell proliferation. However, how BRCA 2 mutations predispose women specifi-cally to breast and ovarian cancer remains undefined. Here we found that BRCA 2 binds and stabilizes MAGE-D 1, a member of the MAGE gene family of proteins. Expression of BRCA 2 and MAGE-D 1 synergistically suppresses cell proliferation inde-pendently of the p 53 pathway. Using two MAGE-D 1 <b>RNA</b> <b>interferences</b> and two cell lines expressing low or undetectable levels of MAGE-D 1, we further showed that the expression of MAGE-D 1 is required for BRCA 2 -mediated suppression of cell proliferation, indicating that MAGE-D 1 is a downstream target of BRCA 2 and that BRCA 2 suppresses cell proliferation via stabilizing MAGE-D 1. Importantly, MAGE-D 1 protein expression was reduced in 6 of 16 breast carcinoma cell lines tested as compared with untransformed immortal mammary epithelial cell lines, suggesting that suppression of MAGE-D 1 expression may be involved in the tumorigenesis of a subset of sporadic breast cancers.

However, our results show that <b>RNA</b> mediated <b>interference</b> against C. elegans calmodulin and candidate MLCKs had no effect on cytokinesis in wild-type or RhoK mutant embryos, ruling out the calmodulin/MLCK pathway as the missing regulator of cytokinesis in the C. elegans early embryo...|$|R
5|$|The role of <b>RNA</b> <b>interference</b> in {{mammalian}} {{innate immunity}} is poorly understood, and relatively little data is available. However, {{the existence of}} viruses that encode genes able to suppress the RNAi response in mammalian cells may be evidence in favour of an RNAi-dependent mammalian immune response, although this hypothesis has been challenged as poorly substantiated.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} a number of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that use RNA as their {{template}} for synthesis of a new strand of RNA.

In addition, the clinical value of p 53 as a predictive marker for 5 -FU-based chemotherapy remains a matter of debate. Here, we used HCT 116 human colorectal cancer cells expressing wild-type p 53 and investigated whether inhibition of Fas expression by <b>interference</b> <b>RNA</b> modulates 5 -FU-induced apoptosis. Cells were treated with 5 -FU (1, 4 or 8  μM) for 8 – 48  h. Cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion. Apoptosis was assessed by changes in nuclear morphology and caspase activity. The <b>interference</b> <b>RNA</b> technology was used to silence Fas expression. Caspase activation, p 53, Fas, cytochrome c, and Bcl- 2 family protein expression was evaluated by immunoblotting. 5 -FU was cytotoxic in HCT 116 cells (p< 0. 001). Nuclear fragmentation and caspase- 3, - 8 and - 9 activities were also markedly increased in HCT 116 cells after 5 -FU (p< 0. 001). In addition, wild-type p 53 and Fas expression were 25 - and 4 -fold increased (p< 0. 05). Notably, when <b>interference</b> <b>RNA</b> was used to inhibit Fas, 5 -FU-mediated nuclear fragmentation and caspase activity were markedly reduced in HCT 116 cells. Finally, western blot analysis of mitochondrial extracts from HCT 116 cells exposed to 5 -FU showed a 6 -fold increase in Bax, together with a 3 -fold decrease in cytochrome c (p< 0. 001). In conclusion, 5 -FU exerts its cytotoxic effects, in part, through a p 53 /Fas-dependent apoptotic pathway that involves Bax translocation and mitochondrial permeabilization...|$|R
5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not {{generally considered to be}} analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It has been suggested that CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic <b>RNA</b> <b>interference</b> systems, although none of the protein components are orthologous.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{possible}} to exploit <b>RNA</b> <b>interference</b> in therapy.

5|$|Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, a {{regulatory}} system similar to <b>RNA</b> <b>interference.</b> Antisense RNAs are widespread; most downregulate a gene, {{but a few}} are activators of transcription.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether epigenetic mechanisms can regulate leptin's expression and affect its downstream targets as metalloproteinases 3, 9, 13 in osteoarthritic chondrocytes. Methods: DNA methylation in leptin promoter {{was measured by}} DNA bisulfite sequencing, and mRNA expression levels were measured by real-time quantitative PCR in osteoarthritic {{as well as in}} normal cartilage. Osteoarthritic articular cartilage samples were obtained from two distinct locations of the knee (n = 15); from the main defective area of maximum load (advanced osteoarthritis (OA)) and from adjacent macroscopically intact regions (minimal OA). Using small <b>interference</b> <b>RNA,</b> we tested if leptin downregulation would affect matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 13 activity. We also evaluated the effect of the demethylating agent, 59 -Aza- 2 -deoxycytidine (AZA) and of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) on leptin expression in chondrocyte cultures. Furthermore, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation in leptin's promoter area. Results: We found a correlation between leptin expression and DNA methylation and also that leptin controls MMP- 13 activity in chondrocytes. Leptin's downregulation with small <b>interference</b> <b>RNA</b> inhibited MMP- 13 expression dramatically. After 5 -AZA application in normal chondrocytes, leptin's methylation was decreased, while its expression was upregulated, and MMP- 13 was activated. Furthermore, TSA application in normal chondrocyte cultures increased leptin's expression. Also, chromatin immunoprecipitation in leptin's promoter after TSA treatment revealed that histone H 3 lysines 9 and 14 were acetylated. Conclusion: We found that epigenetic mechanisms regulate leptin's expression in chondrocytes affecting its downstream target MMP- 13. Small <b>interference</b> <b>RNA</b> against leptin deactivated directly MMP- 13, which was upregulated after leptin's epigenetic reactivation, raising the issue of leptin's therapeutic potential for osteoarthritis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableFaculty Mentor: Karen Cone, Biological SciencesEpigenetic {{regulation}} of gene expression {{is determined by}} chromatin packing. Transcriptionally active genes are associated with open, less compacted chromatin, whereas transcriptionally less active or silent genes are found in tightly packed, inaccessible chromatin. At the DNA level, genes that are silenced by chromatin frequently {{have high levels of}} cytosine methylation. Our goal is to understand the mechanisms behind chromatin-level regulation in maize. We are taking a functional genomics approach by making transgenic lines that use <b>RNA</b> <b>interferences</b> (RNAi) to knock down expression {{of a large number of}} chromatin genes and assay the phenotypes in the resulting RNAi lines. Among the genes we are studying are chr 101 and chr 106, which are duplicates with sequence similarity to a gene in Arabidopsis that is involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation. As a step in understanding how chr 101 and chr 106 function, we have crossed the RNAi lines to a line containing the Pl-Blotched gene. This gene is an allele of the Purple gene, which controls the synthesis of purple anthocyanin pigments in the corn plant. Pl-Blotched leads to a variegated pattern of pigmentation, rather than the normal uniformly purple phenotype. At the molecular level, this variegation is associated with closed chromatin and high levels of DNA methylation. If the chromatin state of Pl-Blotched is regulated by chr 101 and / or chr 106, then knocking out expression of these genes by RNAi should lead to higher levels of expression of Pl-Blotched. To test this idea, we are comparing anthocyanin levels in Pl-Blotched plants carrying the chr 101 and chr 106 RNAi transgenes to the pigment levels in non-transgenic siblings...|$|R
5|$|Pattern {{recognition}} receptors are proteins used {{by nearly}} all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens.

5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. <b>RNA</b> <b>interference</b> is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E
5|$|<b>RNA</b> <b>interference</b> genes, as {{components}} of the antiviral innate immune system in many eukaryotes, are involved in an evolutionary arms race with viral genes.
