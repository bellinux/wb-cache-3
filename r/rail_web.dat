5000|$|Generally the motor(s) fed {{a single}} axle with other wheels linked by {{connecting}} rods, as the induction motor {{is sensitive to}} speed variations and with non-linked motors on several axles the motors on worn wheels would do little or even no work as they would rotate faster. This motor characteristic led to a mishap in the Cascade Tunnel to a GN east-bound freight train with four electric locos, two {{on the head and}} two pushing. The two pushers suddenly lost power and the train gradually slowed to a stop. But the lead unit engineer was unaware that his train had stopped, and held the controller on the power position until the usual time to transit the tunnel had elapsed. Not seeing daylight, he finally shut down the locomotive, and found that the wheels of his stationary loco had ground through two-thirds of the <b>rail</b> <b>web.</b>|$|E

It used the dynain file method to apply the initial residual stress to the rails, and conducted numerical simulation {{to the process of}} dynamic wheel/rail rolling contact under the operation condition which is corresponding to the setting of taking velocity and axle load as the variables. The simulation results can show that with the increase of velocity, the equivalent stress on the outer rail railhead and at the <b>rail</b> <b>web</b> will increase accordingly; the equivalent stress on the inner rail railhead and at the <b>rail</b> <b>web</b> will decrease accordingly; and the equivalent stress on the rail flange will be basically the same.

On the other hand, wheel-rail lateral contact forces are more directly involved in the running safety and deserve a special focus. In this paper, an experimental approach to estimate lateral forces applied by rolling stock to the track is presented. The method is based on the analysis of bending strains in the cross plane of the <b>rail</b> <b>web.</b> This approach allows the decoupling of effects of the lateral force from those of the vertical one with a simple combination of bending stresses measured on the <b>rail</b> <b>web.</b> The research uses finite element simulations and laboratory tests.

40|$|The {{risk for}} {{initiation}} of fatigue {{cracks in the}} rail head and web in the weld zone of a rail is studied. The interaction between the welding residual stress field and the stress field caused by service loads is simulated in a nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis where the welding residual stress distribution (shape) and magnitude, the service load magnitude and the material parameters used in the fatigue life estimation are varied. The initiation of fatigue cracks is assessed using the shear-stress-based multiaxial fatigue criterion proposed by Dang Van, and the propagation of fatigue cracks in the <b>rail</b> <b>web</b> is carried out using a Paris-type crack growth law. A discussion is presented of the interpretation of using the Dang Van criterion to assess crack initiation for stress–response load cycles with low shear stress amplitudes and high hydrostatic stress levels. In addition, the accuracy in the fatigue life assessment is evaluated by statistical uncertainty analysis where the variances according to the Gauss approximation formula are studied. The risk for fatigue crack initiation and propagation in the rail head and <b>rail</b> <b>web,</b> respectively, is enhanced due to the welding residual stress, and the uncertainty in load level dominates the uncertainty in the fatigue assessments...|$|E

40|$|Joints in {{railway track}} are {{vulnerable}} to failure, so most modern rail is welded. However, many signalling systems rely on sections of rail being electrically isolated from adjacent sections so insulated joints are necessary. At these joints several millimetres of insulation material, an “end post”, separates {{the ends of the}} rails. To support the rail two pieces of steel (known as fish-plates) are bolted {{on either side of the}} <b>rail</b> <b>web.</b> All steel components are separated from each other by insulation material. Conventional designs of rail joints are known to suffer from a range of failure modes: bolt failures, rail breaks, fish-plate failure, insulation degradation, and lipping (in which plastic flow in the rail ends bridges the gap between the rail ends). To assist in developing improved designs accelerated test procedures and sophisticated finite element models have been developed; this paper describes both. Results from physical testing and numerical modelling are presented and compared...|$|E

A simplified 2 D plane stress finite element model is used to simulate the wheel-rail rolling contact impact at IRJ. This model is validated using data from a strain gauged IRJ that was installed in a heavy haul network; data in terms of the vertical and shear strains at specific positions of the IRJ during train passing were captured and compared with the results of the FE model. The comparison indicates a satisfactory agreement between the FE model and the field testing. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the experimental and numerical analyses reported in this paper provide a valuable datum for developing further insight into the behaviour of IRJ under wheel impacts...|$|E

40|$|Vibrations {{produced}} by {{the passage of a}} train have their main source in the wheel-rail contact, producing annoyances to the surroundings when the wheel profile presents wheel flats or another kind of irregularities. Railway transport companies are pointing to the need of using monitoring techniques and predictive maintenance, in order to identify wheel flats and take the suitable measures before the active worsening and the wear in the wheel-track system can be considerable. In this work, a technique for the wheel flats and wheel profile irregularities detection, based on vibrations measured in the rail and related to the passage of a train, is presented. The vertical vibration time history was measured using two accelerometers located {{at the bottom of the}} rail. The strain signal of the <b>rail</b> <b>web,</b> {{produced by}} the passage of a single wheel, was also measured. Wheel flat detection is made by means of a time domain analysis of the vibration velocity signals. The time history analysis allows the knowledge of which wheels show a persistent irregularity. The identification methodology presented constitutes the base for the future development of an algorithm capable to detect automatically wheel flats and other profile irregularities...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{there are}} no {{systematic}} methodologies for evaluating life assessment of the rail, and few systems provide the measures of vertical and lateral forces that train exchanges with the rail. These systems are quite expensive and require the substitution of {{a portion of the}} track. In the present paper is presented a simple transducer (MPQY) for measuring, at the same time, the vertical and lateral forces. The easy installation and use of this instrument are its main characteristics. It is sufficient to put it in a hole, made in the <b>rail</b> <b>web</b> in the concurrence of the drilling axis, and connect it to the transmitting station for measuring for each convoy the vertical and lateral forces induced by each wheel. It can be also used for analysing speed and mass of trains and the specific derailment ratio. In addition, by using a damage model, it is possible to estimate the residual life of a rail. In order to do this, a linear model of rolling contact fatigue damage is implemented and tested with same experimental acquisitions. Another application of this transducer can be identified in the variation of the mechanical behaviour of ballast. In fact, by using the information coming from the MPQY and comparing it with the flexural moment measurement, it is possible to evaluate the variation of ballast behaviour with respect to time and set new parameters for ballast maintenance and train safety...|$|E
40|$|Insulated {{rail joints}} (IRJs) {{identify}} broken rails and train locations in railway signalling circuitry, which {{are critical to}} the rail safety operation. Unfortunately, IRJs exhibit several failure modes due to complex interaction between their components, the load spectra and the support conditions. A novel idea of simplifying {{the design of the}} IRJs consisting of only two pieces of insulated rails embedded into a concrete sleeper {{in such a way that}} the free ends of the rails at the gap attain stiffness commensurate to that of the current designs where the gapped rails are connected with two joint bars (also known as fishplates) one on each side of the <b>rail</b> <b>web</b> with the assembly resting on top of sleepers. The advantages of the new design are that it exhibits stability levels comparable to the current designs with fewer components and hence fewer failure modes. A multi-objective optimisation framework was used for the development of the new design that enables safe passage of train wheels across the gap between the rails embedded in concrete sleepers. Feasibility of the sleeper embedded gapped insulated rails under traffic loading is demonstrated through a dynamic analysis of a rail wheel rolling on top of a selected optimal design from the Pareto front. The deformation components of the rail edge at the gap of the new design are shown to be lower than that of the classical insulated rail joints...|$|E
