40|$|Plant {{protection}} in organic farming has to simultaneously comply with {{two sets of}} regulations: regulations on organic production and pesticide legislation. This chapter describes the organic approach to plant protection, including the role of systems management versus direct interventions, the range of authorised substances and the procedures for authorising new substances and the withdrawal of old substances. External factors not related to organic farming also influence the availability of plant protection products. Scientific, regulatory and economic aspects may limit the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> in a given country. On the other hand, {{there is an alternative}} route for the registration of fertilisers and plant strengtheners in some countries. As a result, the range of plant protection products available to organic farmers varies from one country to another. The history of the authorisation of sodium bicarbonate, spinosad, copper fungicides, clay minerals and granulosis viruses illustrates how the two sets of regulations can interact in very different ways, creating different patterns of availability. The practice of plant protection is illustrated for the prevention and control of apple scab, fire blight and codling moth in organic apple orchards. At the end of the chapter, research perspectives for a ‘self-regulating’ apple orchard where plant protection fully relies on systems management are presented. The level of environmental friendliness already achieved by organic plant protection is discussed, and approaches with the potential for improvement are identified...|$|E

40|$|Objectives In this study, the {{possibility}} of using existing test data provided in Korea and elsewhere for the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> chemical <b>substances</b> was examined. Data on 510 chemical substances that are among the first subject to registration under the “Act on the Registration and Evaluation, etc. <b>of</b> Chemical <b>Substances</b> (K-REACH) ” were analyzed. Methods The possibility of using existing data from 16 reference databases was examined for 510 chemical substances notified in July 2015 as being subject to registration. Results Test data with the reliability required for the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> chemical <b>substances</b> under the K-REACH constituted 48. 4 % of the required physicochemical characteristics, 6. 5 % of the required health hazards, and 9. 4 % of the required environmental hazards. Conclusions Some existing test data were not within the scope of this research, including data used for registration in the European Union (EU). Thus, considering that 350 of these 510 species are registered in EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation & Restriction of Chemicals, more test data may exist that can be utilized in addition to the data identified in this study. Furthermore, the K-REACH states that non-testing data (test results predicted through Read Across, Quantitative Structure- Activity Relationships) and the weight of evidence (test results predicted based on test data with low reliability) can also be utilized for registration data. Therefore, if methods for using such data were actively reviewed, {{it would be possible to}} reduce the cost of securing test data required for the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> chemical <b>substances...</b>|$|R

An assessment for a substance in all existing mixture combinations would be impossible for the registrants. Whilst other potentially hazardous substances cannot be considered in undertaking the REACH <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> a specific <b>substance</b> these do need to be included when duty holders conduct a risk assessment of the workplace under existing health and safety legislation. In the context of workplace legislation, the definition <b>of</b> hazardous <b>substances</b> is wider than the scope of REACH and comprises substances classified according to the Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) legislation and those that do not meet the CLP classification criteria but may be a hazard under workplace circumstances [7].|$|R

The analysis revealed 1, 728 substances with unambiguous identity for which 4, 765 DNELs and DMELs for workers were derived. Number and type of DNELs and DMELs depend on the identified uses and exposure scenarios submitted with the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> a <b>substance.</b> In ECHA's public database, the DNELs and DMELs are presented deep within the structure. An easily accessible and searchable source which specifically provides DNELs and DMELs for registered substances was made available by the German social accidence insurance [20]. It {{is not possible to}} conclude whether all DNELs and DMELs required by REACH have been derived because the number of DNELs and DMELs depend on the hazard, the existing exposure and the approach chosen.|$|R

Therefore it is not possible to get complete information about the average concentration of particulates in different areas in Riga and to value external costs. The main objective was to work out the mathematical model for the calculation of mobile emissions in a definite road section. The elaborated model is based on vehicle kinematics. Cars kinematics is researched in the streets of Riga in different cycles, in different hours and different areas analyzing congested areas as well. In general, these are analysis and synthesis based methods for studying individual problem elements and process components in order to establish the underlying interactions.

UCN and emission factors are assigned for each combination on a country specific level. The purpose of this project has been to present existing data in the most transparent way in order to share, compare and improve data and methodologies. The results can be used for different purposes, e. g., facilitate assignment of specific emission factors to sources and substances, extrapolate activity data and/or emission factors between code systems, filling data gaps and identify key source categories...|$|R
