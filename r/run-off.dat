Daley endorsed Shiller's challenger, Michael Quigley, campaigned with Quigley and sent letters {{in support of}} Quigley. Shiller finished seven votes ahead of Quigley, but a third candidate got 3.4% of the vote, which forced a runoff, the third straight <b>run-off</b> for Shiller and the fourth straight for the 46th ward. In the <b>run-off,</b> Shiller won with 53% of the vote, amid charges that Quigley was a carpetbagger.|$|E

5|$|Elections for {{president}} occur {{every five years}} by a national vote. Candidates, {{as soon as they}} are deemed eligible under Article 80 of the Constitution, are tasked with collecting signatures from eligible voters. After 100,000 signatures are collected and certified, the candidate is declared to be official by the Central Elections Committee. In the voting, the secret ballots are collected directly from eligible voters. During the first round of voting, if a candidate earns fifty percent plus one of the votes, they are declared the President-elect. If no one has achieved that number during the first round, then a <b>run-off</b> election will occur between two candidates who won the most votes. The person who wins the most votes in the <b>run-off</b> is declared the President-elect.|$|E

On August 5, 2008 Jones lost the <b>run-off</b> election to Jim Martin by a margin of 20 points. Jones unexpectedly lost to Martin in his home base of Dekalb County. Jones had lost support within the black community before the runoff election, and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head to head match up against Martin.

5|$|In the primary, Rhea {{achieved}} {{a plurality of}} the votes, but not a majority. Chandler had the next highest vote total, and the two faced {{each other in a}} <b>run-off</b> on September 7, 1935. In the <b>run-off,</b> Chandler defeated Rhea, securing the nomination for governor. President Roosevelt, not wanting Democratic factionalism to cost him votes in the 1936 presidential election, attempted to bring together the Laffoon and Chandler factions, but to little avail. Laffoon and Rhea, along with most of Laffoon's administration, bolted the party and supported Republican nominee King Swope. Despite losing the support of his predecessor, Chandler {{went on to win the}} general election. In his last days in office, Laffoon issued pardons for Denhardt and others charged in connection with the National Guard's interference with the primary in Harlan County. These were among a record 560 pardons issued by Laffoon, most of which were to relieve prison crowding.|$|E

Ravalomanana, claiming to have won {{a majority in the}} first round, refused to participate in a <b>run-off,</b> instead demanding that the High Constitutional Court review the votes. Ratsiraka's supporters then blockaded the capital, which Ravalomanana's supporters controlled. Ravalomanana declared himself president on 22 February 2002. After a recount, on 29 April 2002 the High Constitutional Court pronounced Ravalomanana the winner of an absolute majority {{in the first round of}} the election, and he was sworn in on 6 May.
