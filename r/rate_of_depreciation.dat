2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{theories}} posit Europe's unique {{relationship with the}} New World as {{a major cause of}} the Great Divergence. The high profits earned from the colonies and the slave trade constituted 7percent a year, a relatively high rate of return considering the high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation</b> on pre-industrial capital stocks, which limited the amount of savings and capital accumulation. Early European colonization was sustained by profits through selling New World goods to Asia, especially silver to China. According to Pomeranz, the most important advantage for Europe was the vast amount of fertile, uncultivated land in the Americas which could be used to grow large quantities of farm products required to sustain European economic growth and allowed labor and land to be freed up in Europe for industrialization. New World exports of wood, cotton, and wool are estimated to have saved England the need for 23 to [...] of cultivated land (by comparison, the total amount of cultivated land in England was just 17 million acres), freeing up immense amounts of resources.

40|$|Many {{important}} economic problems require measures {{of physical and}} R&D capital. Except for some recent studies, there have been relatively few contributions in the literature that provide econometric estimates for the <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> physical and R&D capital.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{mechanism}} that explains continued investment in older-vintage technology which rests on complementarity between long-lived and short-lived vintage-specific capital. The main {{result is a}} threshold condition that relates the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> vintage-specific technological progress (ˆq) to two investment patterns: if ˆq is above the threshold, all investment is allocated to the newest-vintage technology; otherwise, firms direct part of their investment to older-vintage technologies. The evidence supports our model's empirically testable implications: as ˆq declines, investment is allocated more toward older-vintage technology; and equipment-price changes depend on capital's heterogeneous <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|More {{specifically}} J.R. Edwards (2013) explained: Matheson {{was one of}} {{the first}} writers to distinguish properly between depreciation (from shortening of the working life of an asset, through physical deterioration), obsolescence (from external causes, such as supersession by improved machines), and fluctuation in value (through changes in market prices). He regarded depreciation much as modern accountants do —- as a measure of consumption of capital, rather than as a revaluation of the asset, and hence as a cost of production, not a voluntary appropriation of profits for replacement. Obsolescence, he thought, should be covered by acceleration of the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation.</b> Fluctuation was to be ignored until a revaluation was necessary, for example, on a change of partners.|$|E

Since consumption is proportional to output ( [...] ), then a choice of value for s implies a unique level of steady state per capita consumption. Out of all possible choices for s, one will produce the highest possible steady state value for c and is called the golden rule savings rate.|$|E
