In the runup of the world climate summit in Warsaw, Schellnhuber discussed possible ways forward with the president of COP19, the Polish Minister of the Environment Marcin Korolec. [...] To advance the state of science, Schellnhuber initiated the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP) that involves more than 30 research teams from 12 countries. In 2013, the scientific journal Nature called it the [...] "first comprehensive global-impact project" [...] - it aims at identifying robust insights as well as <b>research</b> <b>gaps,</b> based on a yet unprecedentedly broad comparison of computer simulations of future climate change impacts such as water scarcity, floodings, or yield changes.

50|$|In short, {{critical}} gaps {{exist in}} the literature, with a paucity of prospective, controlled studies on late-life outcomes and neurodegeneration after mTBI and related basic science research. These <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> are particularly prominent in the injuries and difficulties seen in combat-exposed populations. The existing research, although suggestive, is not rigorous or robust enough {{to allow for a}} clear understanding of the relationships, risks, and potential effective interventions for mTBI, chronic symptoms, and neurodegeneration. To date, no controlled prospective longitudinal study has examined the late-life cognitive, behavioral, systemic, and functional effects of TBI of any severity. Given the absence of prospective studies, the association between TBI and early neurodegeneration is merely theoretical, and the actual risk factors and rate/extent of physiologic and clinical decline over time are unknown. It is also unclear whether a single TBI may be enough to begin a degenerative cascade in select individuals or whether a critical number (dose threshold) of TBIs is needed to “prime” the central nervous system for degeneration. As the majority of TBIs in the military are mild, prospective studies of cognitive outcomes from mild injury are necessary to determine the long-term risks posed to SMs and Veterans. The potential link between mTBI and the development of early dementia is a significant concern for not only at-risk SMs, Veterans, and their families, but also for DoD and VA resource planning, given the high service utilization in the DoD and VA health systems associated with dementia.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide an {{empirical}} basis for understanding the issue of resistance within knowledge intensive firms. The paper initially provides a theoretical investigation identifying the <b>research</b> <b>gap</b> within the literature.

Moreover, the findings distinctively support that, staff resistance is beyond previously (traditional) assumed polar distinctions. In that way, the investigation illustrates that, staff resistance combines opposing meanings of their actions. Thus, it is revealed new aspects of employees resistance within the case organization, a knowledge intensive firm (KIF) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{establish}} research propositions that can potentially fill <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> in the literature of environmental scanning. Major databases such as ABI/INFORM, and Emerald have been searched to gather literature. The literature on environmental scanning is reviewed with an aim to identify patterns in scanning practices as well as <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> in the extant literature. Three major phases of the development and three main characteristics of the literature have been identified. Four propositions are suggested to fill the <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> in the literature of the environmental scanning practices; namely, firm characteristics, market orientation, and top management cognition perspective. Further empirical research is needed to test the four propositions in order to provide a full picture for the environmental scanning literature. The contributions of this paper are: 1) the revelation of the evolution of the environmental scanning literature; 2) the identification of <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> in the environmental scanning literature; 3) the establishment of propositions through which future research can further the knowledge of environmental scanning. <br /...|$|E

The DGA provide science-based advice to promote health and reduce risk for major chronic diseases through diet and physical activity. The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees are charged to provide updates of the DGA topics using the best available science. The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees' reports also identified 169 <b>research</b> <b>gaps.</b> To date, these gaps have not been compiled and assessed. We evaluated trends in number, topics, and specificity of <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> by year by placing them in the following topic categories: general, chronic diseases/conditions, diet/diet pattern, food/ingredient, and nutrient-specific <b>research</b> <b>gaps.</b> Some research topics (eg, sodium and hypertension and appropriate uses of DGA) have been identified consistently across the years, some emerged in later years (eg, increasingly specific <b>research</b> <b>gaps</b> between dietary fatty acids and cardiovascular disease), and others appeared intermittently (eg, relationships between dietary components and cancer). These results are {{a call to action}} for all DGA stakeholders to have an immediate dialogue about how the research enterprise can best address critical research needs in a timely way to support public policy...|$|E
