The images created with <b>ray-tracing</b> programs have noticeable blocky shapes on the terrain. Certain low-intensity compression artifacts might be acceptable when simply viewing the images, but can be emphasized if the image is subsequently processed, usually resulting in unacceptable quality. Consider the example below, demonstrating the effect of lossy compression on an edge detection processing step.|$|E
500|$|Character shading {{supervisor}} on {{the film}} Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges {{on the film}}, saying: [...] "Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning {{as much as we}} could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone." [...] Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: [...] "Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for Cars we added a <b>ray-tracing</b> capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{implementation}} of a [...] "real-time" [...] ray-tracer was credited at the 2005 SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference as the REMRT/RT tools developed in 1986 by Mike Muuss for the BRL-CAD solid modeling system. [...] Initially published in 1987 at USENIX, the BRL-CAD ray-tracer is the first known {{implementation of}} a parallel network distributed <b>ray-tracing</b> system that achieved several frames per second in rendering performance. [...] This performance was attained {{by means of the}} highly optimized yet platform independent LIBRT <b>ray-tracing</b> engine in BRL-CAD and by using solid implicit CSG geometry on several shared memory parallel machines over a commodity network. [...] BRL-CAD's ray-tracer, including REMRT/RT tools, continue to be available and developed today as Open source software.|$|E

40|$|A {{previously}} developed Monte-Carlo <b>ray-trace</b> {{model has}} been modified to incorporate multiple luminescent species. Liquid luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) have been fabricated to verify the <b>ray-trace</b> predictions for LSCs containing multiple luminescent dyes. Single dye and multiple dye solutions of varying concentrations can be easily prepared and inserted into the experimental liquid LSC setup. In this way, experimental uncertainties, such as reduction in the luminescent quantum yield, can be reduced. Hence, the spectral effects of various single and multiple dyes can be analysed and compared more accurately with <b>ray-trace</b> predictions. Initial results from the liquid LSC characterisation and comparison with model predictions are presented here...|$|R

Immediately post-launch, NuSTAR has observed bright point sources such as Cyg X- 1, Vela X- 1, and Her X- 1 for the PSF calibration. We use the point source observations taken at several off-axis angles together with a <b>ray-trace</b> model to characterize the in-orbit angular response, and find that the <b>ray-trace</b> model alone does not fit the observed event distributions and applying empirical corrections to the <b>ray-trace</b> model improves the fit significantly. We describe the corrections applied to the <b>ray-trace</b> model and show that the uncertainties in the enclosed energy fraction (EEF) of the new PSF model is (approximately less than) 3 % for extraction apertures of R (approximately greater than) 60 ″ with no significant energy dependence. We also show that the PSF of the NuSTAR optics has been stable {{over a period of}} ~ 300 days during its in-orbit operation...|$|R

In some cases, neither <b>ray-trace</b> analysis nor diffraction analysis can give an adequate description of an optical system. The designer that is faced {{with the problem of}} analyzing such a system is forced to use a <b>ray-trace</b> program to determine aberrations in the exit pupil and then introduce aberration coefficients into a diffraction model that simulate the propagation. This approach was found rather awkward, especially if complicated aberrations are present.
