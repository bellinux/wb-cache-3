40|$|It is an {{accepted}} principle in South African law that movable property acquired in an original way (by operation of law) is not burdened by any limited real rights, as previous limited real rights are extinguished on the vesting of ownership (mobilia non habent sequelam). It is assumed by some South African writers {{that the same}} principles are applicable to the original {{acquisition of immovable property}} and that all existing limited real rights fall away on original acquisition of ownership. In this article the nature of limited real <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>immovable</b> property is examined, and the notion that ownership is the "mother" right on which all limited real rights are based is scrutinised critically. The nature and establishment of limited real <b>rights</b> are used <b>to</b> distinguish between the essence and effect of limited real rights in the case of immovable property. The recognition of limited real rights as constitutional property is used as a further argument that limited real rights cannot be extinguished automatically by the original acquisition of immovable property, as such common law or statutory measures will constitute an arbitrary deprivation of property in terms of section 25 of the Constitution. The statutory provisions regarding limited real rights in the case of prescription and expropriation are then analysed as an indication {{that it is not a}} general principle that limited real rights are extinguished automatically on the original acquisition of ownership of immovable property...|$|R

40|$|The {{real estate}} tax is usually a fiscal {{instrument}} which performs the property tax. When it comes to real property or immovable this term include: apartments, houses, land, cottages, excess housing landscape and more. The {{real estate tax}} {{as a form of}} the fiscal charges ownership or use of certain forms of real estate, and the revenue from this tax is levied on the area where the property is located regardless of the place of residence of its owner. The tax base for the calculation of this tax usually consists of the market, estimated or annuity value of certain real estate. This form of taxation in the Republic of Serbian applies from 1. 1. 2012., and its introduction has been replaced by former property taxes. The differences between the two concepts mentioned taxes are numerous and significant. Among the more important are: subject to taxation under the new concept of the real estate rather than law, a taxpayer is any property owner rather than the holder of <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>immovable</b> property tax base is the market value of real estate which is replaced by the payment of taxes per square meter of usable area, the rate of property tax is determined local government, which can not be lower than 0. 05 % of the estimated value of the real estate nor higher than 0. 5 % of the appraised value of real estate. The last change, ie. The new law on Property Tax from 5. 11. 2015. was determined by the tax rate to 20 %. The fact that local governments each of them determines the tax rate on real estate which range from high to low rates of multiple, makes this tax is progressive. Progression is particularly expressed in the distinction applied tax rates of developed and undeveloped municipalities, where we have a case that less developed tolerate a higher tax burden, which leads to negative economic effects. However, real estate tax has its own economic and social characteristics which must be aligned with the objectives of tax policy. This means that the real estate tax should be considered {{from the standpoint of the}} entire tax system and not from the standpoint of individual income tax forms...|$|R

Posebna pozornost usmjerena je na nasljednopravna načela, i to ona koja su u svakodnevnoj primjeni izazivala najviše osporavanja. Riječ je o načelu obvezatnosti neposrednog sveopćeg sljedništva (univerzalne sukcesije) i načelu ravnopravnosti pravnih subjekata neovisno o spolu.

Introduction of the General Civil Code {{marked a}} turning-point in the {{socio-economic}} and legal {{development of the}} Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia. The initial reluctance to accept the GCC, {{due in part to}} the unconstitutional manner of its enactment, was soon overcome and its impact on Croatia’s legal life has been generally assessed as positive. Nevertheless, the GCC’s inheritance law regulations were subject to constant criticism, particularly its principles which contradicted the until-then established procedures surrounding inheritance. These were the principle of universal succession and the principle of equality of legal subjects, regardless of gender. These two principles formed a consolidated order in inheritance law for all persons and for all things. This meant that, in comparison to the previous feudal law, it did not distinguish between inheritance of movable or immovable property, nor did it matter whether the decedent left behind acquired or hereditary assets. Also, it did not matter whether the decedent was a woman or a man, nor did the gender of the heirs matter. The reluctance to accept these principles may be even more narrowly seen as unwillingness <b>to</b> accept women’s <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> inherit <b>immovable</b> property. The probate documents of the Croatian-Slavonian courts show the ways in which decedents avoided the women’s inheritance <b>rights</b> by resorting <b>to</b> various donations inter vivos and mortis causa, pointing to the conclusion that despite all of the expressed criticism, one may speak of the real-life adjustment to the system established by GCC...|$|R
40|$|There are strict formalities {{involved}} when a mortgagee (as {{holder of}} a real security <b>right)</b> wants <b>to</b> declare <b>immovable</b> property executable <b>to</b> satisfy outstanding debt. There are various stages in this foreclosure process that a mortgagee must comply with before he can enforce his limited real right by calling up the mortgage bond to satisfy the outstanding debt. This process {{can be divided into}} four stages: first, the pre-trial debt enforcement procedure; secondly, the determination of jurisdiction; thirdly, the calling up of the mortgage bond and the court procedure; and lastly, attachment and execution sale. Over the past decade, foreclosure proceedings have undergone significant changes, largely owing to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 and consumer protection legislation such as the National Credit Act 34 of 2005. This paper addresses recent legal developments with reference to case law and legislation with regard to the first three stages of the procedures mentioned above.
