40|$|In a {{modification}} of the familiar sentence-picture comprehension task (Chase & Clark, 1972), 70 university undergraduates verified simple sentence-picture pairs. Two reaction times were collected on each trial: (a) comprehension time, the time to study a sentence of the form PLUS IS (NOT) ABOVE STAR, and (b) verification time, the time to verify whether {{a picture of the}} form,+ was true with respect to the sentence. The <b>verification</b> <b>reaction</b> times of individual subjects were fit to the Carpenter and Just (1975) constituent comparison model and two groups of subjects were isolated. The larger group was well fit by the model, indicating that they adopted a linguistic strategy. The smaller group was poorly fit by the model; their reaction time pattern suggested use of a pictorial-spatial strategy. Psychometric measures confirmed a clear {{difference between the two groups}} in spatial ability but not in verbal ability. This difference was consistent with the hypothesized verification strategies; the subjects using the pictorial-spatial strategy demonstrated markedly higher spatial ability. These findings limit the generalizability of any linguistic comparison model by demonstrating that tWO quite different comprehension strategies are used consistently by different subjects. More important, the subject's choice of strategy is predictable from his psychometric measures of cognitive ability...|$|R

40|$|The direct {{detection}} of organic biomarkers for living or fossil microbes on Mars by an in situ instrument {{is a worthy}} goal for future lander missions. We have proposed an instrument based on immunological reactions to specific antibodies to cause activation of fluorescent stains. Antibodies are raised or acquired {{to a variety of}} general and specific substances that might be in Mars soil. These antibodies are then combined with various fluorescent stains and applied to small numbered spots on a small (two to three centimeters) test plate where they become firmly attached after drying. On Mars, a sample of soil from a trench or drill core is extracted with water and/or an organic solvent that is then applied to the test plate. Any substance, which has an antibody on the test plate, will react with its antibody and activate its fluorescent stain. A small ultraviolet light source will illuminate the test plate, which is observed with a small CCD camera. The numbered spots that fluoresce indicate the presence of the tested-for substance, and the intensity indicates relative amounts. The entire instrument can be quite small and light, on the order of ten cm in each dimension. A possible choice for light source may be small UV lasers at several wavelengths. Up to 1000 different sample spots can be placed on a plate 3 cm on a side, but a more practical number might be 100. Each antibody can have a redundant position for independent <b>verification</b> of <b>reaction.</b> Some of the wells or spots can contain simply standard fluorescent stains used to detect live cells, dead cells, DNA, etc. These the stains in these spots may be directly activated; no antibodies are necessary...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} urban population and {{growing number of}} motor vehicles, traffic congestion is becoming a major problem of the 21 st century. One {{of the main reasons}} behind traffic congestion is accidents which can not only result in casualties and losses for the participants, but also in wasted and lost time for the others that are stuck behind the wheels. Early detection of an accident can save lives, provides quicker road openings, hence decreases wasted time and resources, and increases efficiency. In this study, we propose a preliminary real-time autonomous accident-detection system based on computational intelligence techniques. Istanbul City traffic-flow data for the year 2015 from various sensor locations are populated using big data processing methodologies. The extracted features are then fed into a nearest neighbor model, a regression tree, and a feed-forward neural network model. For the output, the possibility of an occurrence of an accident is predicted. The results indicate that even though the number of false alarms dominates the real accident cases, the system can still provide useful information {{that can be used for}} status <b>verification</b> and early <b>reaction</b> to possible accidents...|$|R

However, certain limitations such as high temperature stability and brittleness limit its applicability. This problem is addressed by reinforcing PLA with a variety of materials but the process gives rise to different issues in compatibilization due to differences in polarity of materials.

40|$|Isoprene is the {{dominant}} non-methane organic compound emitted by vegetation into the atmosphere, with a global emission rate of ~ 500 Tg yr- 1. Its oxidation serves as {{a major source of}} ground level ozone in North America during the summer months. Despite the significant impact on tropospheric chemistry, questions remain concerning the detailed oxidation mechanism. The initial step in the mechanism is the addition of OH to form four distinct isomers. The relative branching between these isomers influences the distribution of the final products. I present a comprehensive investigation into the mechanistic details of early steps in the oxidation mechanism of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the troposphere and employ theoretical and experimental techniques. To understand the detailed kinetics of the initial OH addition to unsaturated hydrocarbons, I first present a model developed for the ethylene-OH system. I present the details of a robust two-transition state model. I extend the developed two-transition state model to the case of OH addition to isoprene. Excellent agreement with observed temperature and pressure dependent rate constants affords a high confidence level in understanding of the kinetics and in the calculated branching ratio of the initial OH addition step. I then focus attention on the subsequent reactivity of the OH-isoprene adducts. Until recently, all four of the OH-isoprene adducts were supposed to have reacted with O 2 via addition to form alkylperoxy radicals. Previous computational results suggest that two of the OH-isoprene adducts undergo an intramolecular cyclic isomerization followed by hydrogen abstraction by O 2 to form stable carbonyl compounds. I have synthesized photolytic precursors, presenting a novel approach to probe the subsequent reactivity of individual hydroxyalkyl <b>radicals.</b> Initial <b>verification</b> of the cyclic isomerization pathway involved synthesis of the photolytic precursor corresponding to the 1, 3 -butadiene-OH adduct. A culmination of theoretical and experimental techniques allowed verification of the cyclic isomerization pathway. I synthesized the photolytic precursor, which provided a single isoprene-OH adduct. Employing laser photolysis/laser induced fluorescence, time-dependent multiplexed mass spectrometry, velocity map ion imaging, and theoretical techniques, we present the full characterization of the reactivity of the single isoprene-OH adduct in the presence of O 2...|$|R

VML has developed in four evolutionary stages. VML 0 is a core execution capability providing multi-threaded command execution, integer data types, and rudimentary branching. VML 1 added named parameterized procedures, extensive polymorphism, data typing, branching, looping issuance of commands using run-time parameters, and named global variables. VML 2 added for loops, data <b>verification,</b> telemetry <b>reaction,</b> {{and an open}} flight adaptation architecture. VML 2. 1 contains major advances in control flow capabilities for executable state machines. On the resource requirements front, VML 2. 1 features a reduced memory footprint in order to fit more capability into modestly sized flight processors, and endian-neutral data access for compatibility with Intel little-endian processors. Sequence packaging has been improved with object-oriented programming constructs {{and the use of}} implicit (rather than explicit) time tags on statements. Sequence event detection has been significantly enhanced with multi-variable waiting, which allows a sequence to detect and react to conditions defined by complex expressions with multiple global variables. This multi-variable waiting serves as the basis for implementing parallel rule checking, which in turn, makes possible executable state machines. The new state machine feature in VML 2. 1 allows the creation of sophisticated autonomous reactive systems without the need to develop expensive flight software. Users specify named states and transitions, along with the truth conditions required, before taking transitions. Transitions with the same signal name allow separate state machines to coordinate actions: the conditions distributed across all state machines necessary to arm a particular signal are evaluated, and once found true, that signal is raised. The selected signal then causes all identically named transitions in all present state machines to be taken simultaneously. VML 2. 1 has relevance to all potential space missions, both manned and unmanned. It was under consideration for use on Orion...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The {{demand for}} energy is {{increasing}} throughout the world, and {{fossil fuel resources}} are diminishing. At the same time, the use of fossil fuels is slowly being reduced because it pollutes the environment. Research into alternative energy sources becomes necessary and important. An alternative fuel should not only replace fossil fuels but also address the environmental challenges posed {{by the use of}} fossil fuels. Hydrogen is an environmentally friendly substance considering that its product of combustion is water. Hydrogen is perceived to be a major contender to replace fossil fuels. Although hydrogen is not an energy source, it is an energy storage medium and a carrier which can be converted into electrical energy by an electrochemical process such as in fuel cell technology. Current hydrogen production methods, such as steam reforming, derive hydrogen from fossil fuels. As such, these methods still {{have a negative impact on}} the environment. Hydrogen can also be produced using thermochemical cycles which avoid the use of fossil fuels. The production of hydrogen through thermochemical cycles is expected to compete with the existing hydrogen production technologies. The sulphur iodine (SI) thermochemical cycle has been identified as a high-efficiency approach to produce hydrogen using either nuclear or solar power. A sound foundation is required to enable future construction and operation of thermochemical cycles. The foundation should consist of laboratory to pilot scale evaluation of the process. The activities involved are experimental <b>verification</b> of <b>reactions,</b> process modelling, conceptual design and pilot plant runs. Based on experimental and pilot plant data presented from previous research, this study presents the simulation of the sulphur iodine thermochemical cycle as applied to the South African context.

40|$|Synthesis of {{actinium}} mononitrides using carbothermic {{reduction of}} the corresponding oxides has a few outstanding issues, including the formation of secondary phases such as oxides and carbides and low densities of the final product. Furthermore the requirement of a high process temperature at 1700 °C, for more than 12 hours is also a drawback particularly for Americium-bearing samples. Therefore, {{it is important to}} explore the use of other possible routes to synthesize actinide mononitrides. A low temperature process is used in this research to produce actinide mononitrides using a fluoride route in which {{the first step is to}} mix the actinide oxide with NH 4 HF 2. The second step involves the heat-treatment of the resulting ammonium actinide fluoride salts in ammonia atmosphere. Using different analytical techniques available, the experimental conditions can be studied and optimized to synthesize the required materials with high phase purity. Such available techniques are X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetry and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TG/DSC), and microscopic techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Once the experimental conditions are studied and optimized, a number of actinide nitride systems (uranium, thorium, and neptunium) will be synthesized and characterized to provide knowledge on the chemistry of the systems. Characterization of these nitride systems will include chemical phase identification, lattice parameter refinements, morphological studies, microstructural <b>verifications,</b> thermal behavior, <b>reaction</b> mechanism, and reaction kinetics...|$|R
40|$|Alopecia is an {{exceedingly}} prevalent problem that lacks effective therapy. Recently, {{research has focused}} on early-passage dermal papilla cells (DPCs), which have hair inducing activity both in vivo and in vitro. Our previous study indicated that factors secreted from early-passage DPCs contribute to hair follicle (HF) regeneration. To identify which factors are responsible for HF regeneration and why late-passage DPCs lose this potential, we collected 48 -h-culture medium (CM) from both of passage 3 and 9 DPCs, and subcutaneously injected the DPC-CM into NU/NU mice. Passage 3 DPC-CM induced HF regeneration, based on the emergence of a white hair coat, but passage 9 DPC-CM did not. In order to identify the key factors responsible for hair induction, CM from passage 3 and 9 DPCs was analyzed by iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic technology. We identified 1360 proteins, of which 213 proteins were differentially expressed between CM from early-passage vs. late-passage DPCs, including SDF 1, MMP 3, biglycan and LTBP 1. Further analysis indicated that the differentially-expressed proteins regulated the Wnt, TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways, which directly and indirectly participate in HF morphogenesis and regeneration. Subsequently, we selected 19 proteins for further <b>verification</b> by multiple <b>reaction</b> monitoring (MRM) between the two types of CM. These results indicate DPC-secreted proteins play important roles in HF regeneration, with SDF 1, MMP 3, biglycan, and LTBP 1 being potential key inductive factors secreted by dermal papilla cells in the regeneration of hair follicles...|$|R
40|$|The neutron {{emission}} rate {{is a crucial}} parameter {{for most of the}} radiation sources that emit neutrons. In the case of large fusion devices the determination of this parameter is necessary for a proper assessment of the power release and the prediction for the neutron budget. The 14 MeV neutron generator will be used for calibration of neutron diagnostics at JET and ITER facilities. The stability of the neutron generator working parameters like emission and angular homogeneity affects the accuracy of calibration other neutron diagnostics. The aim of our experiment was to confirm the usefulness of yttrium activation method for monitoring of the neutron generator SODERN Model: GENIE 16.

40|$|LEMURS (INFRAORDER: Lemuriformes) are a {{radiation}} of strepsirrhine primates {{endemic to}} the island of Madagascar. As of 2012, 101 lemur species, divided among five families, have been described. Genetic and morphological evidence indicates all species are descended from a common ancestor that arrived in Madagascar ∼ 55 - 60 million years ago (mya). Phylogenetic relationships in this species-rich infraorder {{have been the subject}} of debate. Here we use Alu elements, a family of primate-specific Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs), to construct a phylogeny of infraorder Lemuriformes. Alu elements are particularly useful SINEs for the purpose of phylogeny reconstruction because they are identical by descent and confounding events between loci are easily resolved by sequencing. The genome of the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) was computationally assayed for synapomorphic Alu elements. Those that were identified as Lemuriformes-specific were analyzed against other available primate genomes for orthologous sequence in which to design primers for PCR (polymerase chain <b>reaction)</b> <b>verification.</b> A primate phylogenetic panel of 24 species, including 22 lemur species from all five families, was examined for the presence/absence of 138 Alu elements via PCR to establish relationships among species.

We demonstrate strong support for the monophyly of Lemuriformes to the exclusion of other primates, with Daubentoniidae, the aye-aye, as the basal lineage within the infraorder. Our results also suggest Lepilemuridae as a sister lineage to Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae as sister to Lemuridae. Among the Cheirogaleidae, we show strong support for Microcebus and Mirza as sister genera, with Cheirogaleus the sister lineage to both. Our results also support the monophyly of the Lemuridae.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Boston UniversityBackground: Semantic and phonological {{processing}} deficits {{are often}} present in aphasia. The degree of interdependence between the deficits {{has been widely}} studied with variable findings. Within semantic processing, category and typicality are proposed to influence accuracy and response time on semantic tasks in both healthy and aphasic subjects. Aims: This study examines the nature of semantic-phonological access in aphasia by comparing adults with aphasia to healthy control subjects. Three semantic tasks and three phonological tasks containing typical and atypical items of six semantic categories {{were used to assess}} the difference in category and typicality effects between persons with aphasia and healthy adults. Finally, we aim to identify demographic factors and formal language measures that correlate with semantic and phonological processing performance. Methods: Twenty patients with aphasia and ten neurologically healthy adults were administered six tasks: category superordinate, category coordinate, semantic feature verification, syllable judgment, rhyme judgment, and phoneme <b>verification.</b> Accuracy and <b>reaction</b> time data were collected and analyzed as three conditions: 1) phonological no name, 2) phonological name provided, and 3) semantic. Results: Patients with aphasia performed with significantly lower accuracy than controls, with greater between-group difference on phonological tasks than on semantic tasks. Patients were significantly slower than control on semantic and phonological no name conditions, but showed no difference on the name provided condition. Both patient and control groups showed category effect on semantic accuracy. The only category effect found on RT was controls on the phonological no name condition. Control showed an effect of typicality on the semantic condition for accuracy while patients showed it for RT. Correlations were found between language measures and education and task performance. Conclusions: Patients demonstrated greater phonological than semantic deficits. Both patient and control groups showed effect of category, but patients showed a reduced effect of typicality. Category and typicality effects are robust in semantic tasks, but not in either phonological task conditions, providing support for discrete serial processing models of lexical processing. Education level was found to be a predictor for semantic boundary knowledge, but not for phonological processing skills...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was the {{investigation}} and development of new synthetic methods for functionalized asymmetric porphyrins with organolithium reagents. Specifically, the following results were obtained : First, an experimental <b>verification</b> of the <b>reaction</b> mechanism of the SNAr reaction of porphyrins with LiR was performed. For this the free bases of 5, 15 -diphenyl- and 5, 15 -dibutylporphyrin and the corresponding NiII-complexes were used as test cases. The intermediates in {{each step of the}} reaction with LiBu were systematically investigated using UV/vis spectroscopy, deuterium labeling, trapping of the intermediates with electrophiles, and variation of the pH of the reaction mixture. It was found, that the nucleophilic reaction of free bases and NiII-complexes proceeds through different intermediates which after the addition of LiBu showed similar UV/vis spectra typical for a phlorin but exhibited different chemical reactivity in the reaction with electrophiles. Here, only NiII-complexes reacted at the meso-position opposite to that of the LiR attack with alkyliodides. Furthermore, a direct oxidation (with DDQ under nonaqueous conditions) of the anionic intermediates of free bases allowed a dimerization giving directly meso-meso linked bisporphyrins. Upon lowering the pH-value of the reaction mixture, different UV/vis spectra were obtained for the intermediates resulting from free bases (phlorin) and NiII-complexes (porphodimethene). Additionally the investigation showed, that the intermediate resulting from NiII-complexes is stable under the reaction conditions in the presence of water and no protonation was observed. According to the results from the investigation of deuterium labeling experiments, the negative charge in the NiII-complexes is preferentially localized at the meso-position opposite to the LiR attack, whereas in the free base the negative charge should be more localized at the nitrogen atoms. A model using a conformational analysis of the intermediates was introduced to explain the different chemical reactivities of free bases and metal complexes. The regioselectivity for meso und betta positions is important for potential applications of the reaction. For a detailed study, 5, 15 -disubstituted and 5, 10, 15 -trisubstited aryl- and alkylporphyrins were treated with phenyl- and alkyllithium reagents (alkyl- = Bu, Pri, Bus und But). Complete regioselectivity and excellent yields for the substitution of the meso positions was found with sterically undemanding organolithium reagents (LiBu, LiPh) whereas more byproducts were observed in the reactions with sterically hindered LiR (R = Pri, Bus und But) and the corresponding target compounds were obtained only in low yields. In addition, simple variation of the reaction conditions provided a route to directly meso-meso linked bisporphyrins in high yields. The influence of the porphyrin central ion on the reactivity of the intermediates was investigated by using LiI-, ZnII-, NiII- and PdII-complexes. Only the intermediates derived from NiII-complexes reacted with alkyl iodides indicating that the postulation that conformational effects govern the chemical reactivity of the intermediates was correct again. In the course of further studies on the reactivity various organolithium reagents with different reactivities such as alkyl-, alkenyl-, alkinyl-, phenyl-, benzyl- and heteroaryllithium were used for reaction with 5, 15 -diphenylporphyrin. Aryl- and n-alkyllithium reagents generally gave the best yields. On the basis of the results discussed above, a general synthetic method for functionalized A 2 B- and A 2 BC-porphyrins was developed. Especially noteworthy is the reaction of the monoanionic NiII-intermediates, prepared in situ by reaction with LiR, with alkyl iodides. This constitutes a one-flask synthesis that allows the regioselective introduction of two different substituents in the porphyrin system. Using the reaction discussed above, many novel porphyrins with functional groups like ?OH, -CHO, -CºCH, -COOH, -COOEt, -CN, -I and ?NH 2 were prepared in good yields. In order to test the chemical reactivity of the functional groups introduced, the synthesized porphyrins were employed as reaction precursors for further connections with target molecules. All introduced functional groups showed a satisfactory chemical reactivity and can be used as reaction centers for the synthesis of complex tetrapyrrole systems with special chemical and physical properties. In addition, a new synthesis way leading to 5, 5 ?, 15, 15 ?-tetrasubstituted functionalized asymmetric porphodimethenes was found. This reaction involved trapping of monoanionic NiII-intermediates with alkyl iodides with small substituents such as (ICH 2) 4 CN, MeI, and NCCH 2 I. The structure and conformation of the novel porphodimethenes was investigated via NOE and 1 H- 13 C-NMR experiments. The present work has resulted in the development of several facile and efficient synthetic strategies for a regioselective introduction of almost any functional group into the porphyrin system allowing the synthesis of asymmetrically substituted porphyrins for further synthetic studies on tetrapyrroles...|$|R
40|$|Aquaporins are a {{subclass}} of a ubiquitous protein family, {{the major}} intrinsic proteins (MIPs), {{and are thus}} represented in all domains of life. Their primordial function as integral membrane channels is the passive mediation of water across lipid bilayer barriers. In addition, various alternative substrates, such as small uncharged molecules, gases, carbohydrates, metalloids or ions {{have been found to}} be transported via aquaporins. As such, they fulfill a wide range of physiological functions and are of growing interest as targets for medical, as well as industrial applications. In plants, aquaporins are divided into five subclasses based on their localization, substrate specificity and sequence similarity: Plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), tonoplast membrane intrinsic proteins (TIPs), Nodulin 26 -like intrinsic proteins (NIPs), small basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs) and uncategorized (X) intrinsic proteins (XIPs). PIPs as the largest group are further split up into PIP 1 and PIP 2 phylogenetic subcategories. The latter is differentiated from the former by a shorter N- and a longer C-terminus, an additional number of amino acids in the first extracellular loop A and a significantly higher overall water permeability. Furthermore, PIP 2 s have been described as rather strict water channels, whereas members of the PIP 1 family are more likely to mediate alternative substrates. As typical representatives of their respective PIP subclasses, NtAQP 1 and NtPIP 2; 1 from tobacco were at the center of this thesis. A detailed in silico amino acid sequence analysis and comparison revealed the most significant variances in terms of domain length and sequence identity to be in the N- and C-termini, as well as loop A of these two aquaporins. A previous study found NtAQP 1 water permeation to be unmodulated after its loop A was modified to resemble that of a PIP 2 member. In addition, a multiple sequence alignment with various other MIPs helped identify all sequence motifs relevant for substrate specificity in NtAQP 1 and NtPIP 2; 1. Interestingly, all of them were found to be identical between the two, thus giving way to the hypothesis that their terminal domains could play a significant role in their respective water permeation capabilities. In order to test that hypothesis, an E. coli based continuous exchange cell free expression (CECF) system was established. A total of three different expression modes were tested for experimental applicability. The precipitation based mode (P-CF) without the inclusion of a hydrophobic environment served as a quick initial expression test for newly constructed vectors, as well as <b>verification</b> of individual <b>reaction</b> components. Detergent based cell free expression (D-CF) provided micelles for the direct solubilization of translated aquaporin, but was eventually dismissed as a viable option due to the complexity of its downstream processing. Finally, lipid based cell free expression (L-CF) provided both a liposome based hydrophobic environment for direct integration of translated protein and a downstream processing of comparably low complexity. The water permeability of proteoliposomes containing either of the two tobacco aquaporin wildtypes or terminal domain mutant constructs, as well as empty control liposomes was measured via a Stopped Flow based assay. Therein, (proteo) liposome shrinkage via a hypoosmotic pressure gradient was analyzed via scattered light kinetics. Obtained raw data underwent nonlinear regression to an exponential rise function and thus allowed the calculation of the water permeability factor Pf for individual samples. NtPIP 2; 1 and NtAQP 1 showed water permeation rates in line with previously published results. While the former was a true aquaporin and demonstrated high water permeability, the latter indicated low transport rates barely above that of empty control liposomes. The deletion of either the N- or C-terminal domain in NtPIP 2; 1 caused a significant drop in water permeability to levels equivalent to NtAQP 1 and the control (N) or slightly above that (C). Compared to that, the double deletion mutant demonstrated even lower water transport rates. In contrast, the removal of either of the NtAQP 1 termini did not cause a significant shift in water permeation compared to the wildtype configuration. Deleting both domains, however, resulted in the lowest measured water permeability of all tested constructs. Subsequently, terminal domains were exchanged between the two wildtypes and the impact on their mediation functionality was analyzed. Pf values for NtPIP 2; 1 constructs, where either of the termini were exchanged with NtAQP 1 sequences did not differ significantly from their single deletion counterparts. However, the exchange of both PIP 2 termini resulted in transport rates statistically equivalent to those of the wildtype NtAQP 1 and thus significantly higher than NtPIP 2; 1 with both domains removed. Finally, all NtAQP 1 terminal exchange mutants demonstrated increased water permeation in the following order, when compared with the wildtype: N exchange < C exchange < N & C exchange, with the latter closing two thirds of the water transport gap previously seen between the two wildtype aquaporins. Thus, all three NtAQP 1 exchange mutants showed significantly higher transport rates than their deletion mutant equivalents. Based on the obtained results, various types of previously reported aquaporin regulation were discussed in order to better interpret the role of terminal domains in the water permeability of NtPIP 2; 1 and NtAQP 1. N-terminal acetylation / methylation as a type of post-translational modification, the interaction of termini with neighboring aquaporin monomers and a modification of mechanosensitivity were found to be options in the realm of possibility. In addition, a three-dimensional structure homology modeling of both wildtypes, as well as their respective double deletion and double exchange mutants allowed to spot potential conformation changes in transmembrane regions. In conclusion, both the mere presence, as well as the specific sequence makeup of the terminal domains seem to play a major role in the water transport functionality of both tobacco aquaporins...|$|R
