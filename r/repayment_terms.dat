40|$|MBA - WBSMicro-finance {{serves a}} {{critical}} role in South Africa but it is yet to enjoy the attention of true marketing and customer focus (Rademaker, 2005). It is also an industry that finds itself under increasing political, regulatory and competitive pressures (Porteous & Hazelhurst, 2004). The opportunity to enjoy a position of competitive advantage and long term sustainability therefore exists for progressive micro-finance providers that focus on better understanding and addressing the needs and preferences of their customers. The purpose of the research was to identify and determine the relative importances of the borrowing decision criteria of customers in the micro-finance sector in order to aid market segmentation and product design efforts. The research included a pilot study of 12 micro-finance customers to facilitate the design of the research instruments. Subsequently, the responses collected from a non-probabilistic purposive sample of 88 micro-finance customers were analysed. The analysis was quantitative in nature and applied the conjoint analysis method to determine that on average, micro-finance customers regarded the loan amount of primary importance. Following in order of importance was the affordability of loan repayments, the duration of the <b>repayment</b> <b>term,</b> the service quality, the turnaround time taken to conclude the loan transaction, and finally the price (or total cost) of the credit. To investigate the existence of potential micro-finance segments with different needs and preferences, the output data of the conjoint analysis was further analysed using the principal components analysis and k-means clustering methods. The resulting five segments were profiled and labelled as “ 1. Affordability and <b>repayment</b> <b>term</b> conscious big loan amount borrowers”, “ 2.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} a single-equation {{model to}} analyse the main explanatory factors behind changes in Spanish household credit, {{considering that the}} behaviour of its determinants is exogenous.

Developments in the short run are influenced by changes in long-term interest rates and in employment. The evidence offered suggests that, in general terms, the financing received by households over the period analysed is in line with what may be inferred from its determinants; however, the high volume of debt incurred entails greater exposure of the sector to unexpected changes in its income, in its wealth or in the cost of borrowing, especially in a setting in which floating-rate loans are increasingly significant. credit, household, error correction...|$|R

40|$|AbstractVery often must {{be taken}} into account the gradual {{deterioration}} of goods in inventory management. This fact is not taken into account in multiple management systems. Traditional inventory models at the same time assume that a retailer pays for the goods the moment they are received. Nowadays, however, it is becoming a common practice that a supplier offers a retailer the option to pay for the goods with a certain delay. If the retailer is not able to meet his obligations within the deadline, he is charges an interest. In this study we introduce a newly constructed suitable model which enables a retailer to set an optimal price of deteriorating goods under permissible delay in payments, and to determine the maximum <b>repayment</b> <b>term.</b> We considered a deterministic inventory model with time-dependent demand, holding costs variable in time where deterioration is directly proportional to the time. The model is based on the assumption of time-dependent demand and has been developed for deteriorating goods. The paper further analyses a situation in which the retailer sell all the goods in time, and a situation in which the deadline was not met. Further assumption is that the inventory is depleted only by demand. The scientific aim is to verify if such an optimizing problem can be solved. Theoretical results are illustrated with numerical example for the model. Results show that the developer model is capable of solving the theoretical problem illustrated by an example. It helps to the retailer to set the selling price and the replenishment interval in order to maximize profit. The authors of the paper used methods of analysis and synthesis, and the method of mathematical analysis (differential calculus of multivariable functions, solution of ordinary differential equations, Taylor series). The model suggested in the paper can be expanded in the future. One option is generalization of the model, allowing for the lack of goods, bulk discounts, time value of money, inflation etc...|$|R

40|$|In 1999 the Financial Services Authority {{recommended}} that a standard repayment mortgage was the “best advice” for Independent Financial Advisors {{to give to}} essentially all new mortgage customers seeking the best value repayment vehicle. The FSA simply followed {{the recommendation of the}} 1999 Report of the Endowment Mortgages Working Party of the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries. This working party compared the relative returns and risks with repayment and endowment mortgages over a standard twenty-five year term. Endowment mortgages benefit from compound rates of growth, and so the underlying capital value available for repayment increases disproportionately the longer returns are allowed to accumulate. In selecting between repayment and endowment mortgages, the true mortgage <b>term</b> of <b>repayment</b> therefore becomes the critical determinant of which repayment vehicle is actually the best value. Crucially, the FIA assumed that any variation in the length of mortgage would lead to a reduction in the standard twenty-five term, thus giving further weight to the preference for repayment mortgages as exhibiting better value. This study challenges the FIA’s Working Party assumption about the typical <b>term</b> of <b>repayment</b> in two ways. First, we draw on economists’ recent developments in consumer theory to show that the variation in needs-based expenditure among households is large enough to allow for a considerable cohort of the house-owning population to select to extend their mortgage term beyond twenty-five years. There is therefore no reason in theory why twenty-five years ought to be the upper limit for mortgage debt repayment. We then present the results of a study of a sample of mortgage applicants in the South East of England. These individual case study data are extremely rare, and so the results particularly valuable; and the principal result is that the “true” mortgage term for the largest single cohort of consumers is longer than 25 years. The results indicate that among those applicants trading up (around half of all mortgage applicants) the average extension associated with each move is two years. When this 27 year period is then taken as the standard <b>repayment</b> <b>term,</b> the results of any comparison of the effectiveness of repayment and endowment mortgages changes dramatically in favour of equity-backed investment plans. Simulations based on historic data demonstrate that endowment plans are 19. 2 % and ISA plans 21. 6 % more efficient than straight repayment mortgages over the longer period. Furthermore, the risk of an equity-backed investment plan under-performing is halved when the typical mortgage term is extended from twenty-five to twenty-seven years. We therefore conclude that while the FSA’s “best advice” is indeed applicable to many borrowers, for the majority the reality is that equity-backed methods of mortgage repayment represent a significant improvement compared with the currently favoured repayment mortgages. ...|$|R
