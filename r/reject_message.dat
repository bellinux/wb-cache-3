5000|$|Assignment. On the AGCH, {{the network}} sends the RR Immediate Assignment message (GSM 04.08 Section 9.1.18) for a {{dedicated}} channel, usually an SDCCH. This message is {{addressed to the}} MS by inclusion of the 8-bit tag from the corresponding RACH burst and a time-stamp indicating the TDMA clock state when the RACH burst was received. If no dedicated channel is available for assignment, the BTS can instead respond with the RR Immediate Assignment <b>Reject</b> <b>message,</b> which is similarly addressed and contains a hold-off time for the next access attempt. Emergency callers receiving the <b>reject</b> <b>message</b> {{are not subject to}} the hold-off and may retry immediately.|$|E
50|$|The routers {{between the}} sender and {{listener}} {{have to decide}} if they can support the reservation being requested, and, if they cannot, they send a <b>reject</b> <b>message</b> to let the listener know about it. Otherwise, once they accept the reservation they have to carry the traffic.|$|E
50|$|Make a {{reservation}} {{based on the}} request parameters. For this the admission control and policy control process the request parameters and can either instruct the packet classifier to correctly handle the selected subset of data packets or negotiate with the upper layer how the packet handling should be performed. If they cannot support the reservation being requested, they send a <b>reject</b> <b>message</b> to let the listener know about it.|$|E

50|$|A {{process that}} {{considers}} some other process to have failed will <b>reject</b> <b>messages</b> from the failed incarnation, responding “you have failed”. (That is, processes gossip about failures, and shun failed group members).|$|R
50|$|Before 2000, dual-process {{models of}} persuasion, {{especially}} the elaboration likelihood model and heuristic-systematic model, dominated persuasion research. These models {{attempt to explain}} why people accept or <b>reject</b> <b>message</b> claims. According to these models, the determination of a claim's acceptability can result from careful evaluation of the arguments presented or from reliance on superficial cues, such {{as the presence of}} an expert. Whether receivers scrutinize a message depends {{on the extent to which}} they are able and motivated to process it systematically. As important variables, these models include empathy, familiarity, involvement, and the number and nature of thoughts the message evokes. If these variables are mainly positive, the receiver's attitudes and intentions tend to be more positive; if the variables are predominantly negative, the resulting attitudes and intentions are more negative. These variables also exist in narrative persuasion.|$|E

50|$|B1 is {{an alpha}} {{character}} identifying the station, and B2 is an alpha character {{used to identify}} {{the subject of the}} message. Receivers use these characters to <b>reject</b> <b>messages</b> from certain stations or if the message contains subjects of no interest to the user.|$|R
50|$|E-mail filters act on {{information}} contained in the mail body, in the mail headers such as sender and subject, and e-mail attachments to classify, accept, or <b>reject</b> <b>messages.</b> Bayesian filters, a type of statistical filter, are commonly used. Both client and server based filters are available.|$|R
50|$|The subject {{indicator}} {{character is}} used by the receiver to identify different classes of messages below. The indicator is also used to <b>reject</b> <b>messages</b> concerning certain optional subjects which are not required by the ship (e.g. LORAN C <b>messages</b> might be <b>rejected</b> in a ship which is not fitted with a LORAN C receiver).|$|R

5000|$|Furthermore, some qmail {{features}} {{have been}} criticized for introducing mail forwarding complications; for instance, qmail's [...] "wildcard" [...] delivery mechanism and security design prevents it from <b>rejecting</b> <b>messages</b> to nonexistent senders during SMTP transactions. In the past, these differences may have made qmail behave differently when abused as a spam relay, though modern spam delivery techniques are less influenced by bounce behavior.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "M" [...] bit, {{known as}} the Mandatory bit, {{indicates}} whether support of the AVP is required. If an AVP with the [...] "M" [...] bit set is received by a Diameter client, server, proxy, or translation agent and either the AVP or its value is unrecognized, the <b>message</b> must be <b>rejected.</b> Diameter Relay and redirect agents must not <b>reject</b> <b>messages</b> with unrecognized AVPs.|$|R
50|$|It is not {{possible}} for DSBL to block or intercept mail. E-mail is sometimes blocked or bounced with a message referencing DSBL. These messages were not blocked by DSBL; they were blocked by the administrator of the receiving mail server, who chose to <b>reject</b> <b>messages</b> coming from a potentially-insecure IP address listed by DSBL. See DNSBL for a description of how mail transfer agents interact with these lists.|$|R

50|$|The {{temporary}} rejection can {{be issued}} {{at different stages}} of the SMTP dialogue, allowing an implementation to store more or less data about the incoming message. The trade-off is more work and bandwidth for more exact matching of retries with original <b>messages.</b> <b>Rejecting</b> a <b>message</b> after its content has been received allows the server to store a choice of headers and/or a hash of the message body.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} protocol also {{addresses the}} key issue of verification of the hazard message, which is explained in detail in the next section. RSUs would verify the received hazard message for correctness and <b>reject</b> <b>messages</b> found to be false. Messages verified to be correct can be broadcast to vehicles approaching the hazard. We propose selective transmission of hazard message based on the location of hazard and {{the direction in which}} the vehicles are travelling. This would considerably reduce the network load and enhance the reliability of transmission.|$|R

50|$|Ahmadis {{consider}} Muhammad as {{the greatest}} prophet. They believe in the finality of prophethood with Sharia as final divine law. Prophets can come after Muhammad as his disciples from among his followers. Jews <b>reject</b> Muhammad's <b>message.</b>|$|R

40|$|In model {{checking}} asynchronous {{systems with}} buffered communications (via queues), the state {{space of the}} queue itself, beside the interleaving, can lead to state explosion, expecially in enumerative model checking. For a queue of length n, through which k different values are sent, kn possible states exist. While partial order reduction decreases the relevant number of interleavings, it does not decrease the number of reachable combinations in the queue. For illustration consider a simple protocol (Figure 1), where a process sends acknowledgment and <b>reject</b> <b>messages</b> randomly over a queue to another process, performs some computation and, after some time, takes a decision based on the value that was sent...|$|R

50|$|An {{operational}} {{process that}} learns {{that it is}} considered to have failed (by attempting to communicate with some other process that <b>rejects</b> the <b>message,</b> thereby “shunning” it) might exit from the system, or can increase its incarnation number and rejoin.|$|R
