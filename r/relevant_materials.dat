25|$|Fermi {{had arrived}} at Columbia {{only a short time}} before this {{historic}} demonstration. This bringing together of Fermi and Anderson resulted in a rewarding relationship lasting until the death of Fermi in 1954. Fermi and Anderson conducted a series of experiments at Columbia on the slowing down of neutrons in graphite, absorption and reflection of slow neutrons by numerous <b>relevant</b> <b>materials,</b> fissioning of uranium, and preliminary experiments using a lattice of uranium in graphite. A paper based on Anderson’s PhD thesis, Resonance Capture of Neutrons by Uranium, for security reasons, was not published until 10 years later.|$|E
25|$|In 1991 La Rose, {{together}} {{with a number of}} colleagues, founded the George Padmore Institute (GPI), a library, archive and educational research centre housing materials relating to the life experiences of Caribbean, African and Asian communities in Britain. The aims and objectives of the Institute are to organise: a library, educational resource and research centre, that will allow the materials in its care to be available for use by interested individuals and groups, both in person at the Institute and through the use of modern storage, retrieval and communication methods; educational and cultural activities, including conferences, courses, seminars, talks and readings; the publication of <b>relevant</b> <b>materials.</b> He was the Chairman of the George Padmore Institute from its inception until his death in 2006.|$|E

500|$|On January 5, 1996, a new {{development}} thrust the travel office matter again to the forefront. A two-year-old memo from White House director of administration David Watkins surfaced that identified First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as the motivating force behind the firings, with the additional involvement of Vince Foster and Harry Thomason. [...] "Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action. The action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff." [...] Written in fall 1993, apparently intended for McLarty, the Watkins memo also said [...] "we both know {{that there would be}} hell to pay" [...] if [...] "we failed to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the First Lady's wishes." [...] This memo contradicted the First Lady's previous statements in the GAO investigation, that she had played no role in the firings and had not consulted with Thomason beforehand; the White House also found it difficult to explain why the memo was so late in surfacing when all the previous investigations had requested all <b>relevant</b> <b>materials.</b> [...] House committee chair Clinger charged a cover-up was taking place and vowed to pursue new material.|$|E
