Sharif again put forward the aggressive privatisation and liberalisation programme, starting first with new monetary and taxation policies. At government level, the private-sector was given much support and the public sector was declined under Sharif's new economic policy. Sharif's government liberalise the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> and residents and nonresidents in the country were allowed the open foreign currency accounts with banks and NBFIs. However, such policies were short-lived when Pakistan under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif, ordered to perform nuclear tests in a direct response to Indian nuclear aggression, which led the imposition of UN embargo on both states.|$|E
25|$|The American {{economist}} and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman {{has suggested that}} he fails {{to understand how the}} short term costs of euro membership to the Finnish economy outweigh the large gains caused by greater integration with the European economy. Krugman notes, that Sweden which has yet to join the single currency, had similar rates of growth compared to Finland for the period since the introduction of the euro. Membership of the euro protects Finland from currency fluctuation, which is particularly important for small member states of the European Union like Finland that are highly integrated into the larger European economy. If Finland had retained its own currency, an unpredictable exchange rates would prevent the country from selling its products at competitive prices on the European market. In fact, business leaders in Sweden, which is obliged to join the euro when its economy has converged with the eurozone, are almost universal in their support for joining the euro. Although Sweden's currency is not officially pegged to the euro like Denmark's currency the Swedish government maintains an unofficial peg. This exchange <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> has in the short term benefited the Swedish economy in two ways; (1) much of Sweden's European trade is already denominated in euros and therefore bypasses any currency fluctuation and exchange rate losses, (2) it allows Sweden's non euro-area exports to remain competitive by dampening any pressure from the financial markets to increase the value of the currency. Maintaining this balance has allowed the Swedish government to borrow on the international financial markets at record low interest rates and allowed the Swedish central bank to quantitatively ease into a fundamentally sound economy. This has led Sweden's economy to prosper at the expense of less sound economies who have been impacted by the 2008 financial crisis. Sweden's economic performance has therefore been slightly better than Finland's since the financial crisis of 2008. Much of this disparity has, however, been due to the economic dominance of Nokia, Finlands largest company and Finland's only major multinational. Nokia supported and greatly benefited from the euro and the European single market, particularly from a common European digital mobile phone standard (GSM), but it failed to adapt when the market shifted to mobile computing. One reason for the popularity of the euro in Finland is the memory of a 'great depression' which began in 1990, with Finland not regaining it competitiveness until approximately a decade later when Finland joined the single currency. Some American economists like Paul Krugman claim not to understand the benefits of a single currency and allege that poor economic performance is the result of membership of the single currency. These economists do not, however, advocate separate currencies for member states within the American union, many of which have quite disparate economies.|$|E

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the actual {{exchange}} <b>rate</b> <b>policies</b> followed by Egypt since the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced its adoption of a floating ER regime in January 2003.

First, the de jure “Free Floating ” ER Regime that the CBE announced in January, 2003 was not preserved during the period of the study. Second, the changes in the IMF’s de facto classifications of Egypt’s actual exchange <b>rate</b> <b>policies</b> were broadly accurate. Third, the move from light to heavy exchange market management in 2011 leads to what has been called a one way speculative option. Fourth, too much attention has been paid to the US dollar in setting exchange <b>rate</b> <b>policies.</b> Since the dollar exchange rate sometimes moves substantially against some of these other currencies such as the Euro, it is important that such fluctuations should also be taken into account...|$|R

In {{the last two}} decades, the Myanmar kyat exchange rate of the parallel market has exhibited the sharpest fluctuations among Southeast Asian currencies in real terms. Since the move to a managed float regime in April 2012, the question arises of whether exchange <b>rate</b> <b>policies</b> will be effective in stabilizing the real exchange rate. This paper investigates the sources of fluctuations in the {{real effective exchange rate}} using Blanchard and Quah’s (1989) structural vector autoregression model. As nominal shocks can be created by exchange <b>rate</b> <b>policies,</b> a persistent impact of a nominal shock implies more room for exchange <b>rate</b> <b>policies.</b> Decomposition of the fluctuations into nominal and real shocks indicates that the impact of nominal shocks is small and quickly diminishes, implying that complementary sterilization is necessary for effective foreign exchange market interventions...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} {{monetary}} policy frameworks in the East Asia and Pacific region are heterogeneous, with exchange <b>rate</b> <b>policies</b> being subordinate to domestic price stability objectives in most regional economies. We then argue that in this environment it is undesirable to focus regional cooperation on exchange <b>rate</b> <b>policies</b> {{because of the risk}} of creating conflicts with domestic objectives that would lead to loss of central bank credibility and possibly speculative attacks. We also argue that the case for coordinated exchange <b>rate</b> <b>policies</b> is in fact weak, even after taking into account the region¡¦s traditional emphasis on export performance and increasing regional trade integration. Rather than focusing cooperation on the setting of policy instruments, we suggest an alternative that centres on developing more liquid financial markets in the region in the foreseeable future, and on harmonising the objectives of monetary policy and designing institutions that could form the basis of deeper forms of cooperation in the longer-term future.
