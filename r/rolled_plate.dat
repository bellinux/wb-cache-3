2500|$|Woodcock Forge is {{believed}} to have been built by Jack Dancy of Turners Hill. Hedgecourt Mill is thought to have been remodelled by him about the same time. The pond at Hedgecourt acted as a storage for the Woodcock forge. The tilt hammer was operated by an overshot waterwheel. Another overshot waterwheel worked bellows. In 1574, John Thorpe of Hedgecourt was working the forge in connection with the furnace at Myllwood. in 1586 Thorpe bought property from William Swanne Sr in the Woodcock Forge area. From 1598 to 1606 the rent was paid by Thomas Thorpe, son of John and in 1629 the forge was leased by John Gage to Richard Thorpe, the son of Thomas. His son, also Richard, held the forge until 1651, when it was forfeit in lieu of a debt. Thorpe's interest in the forge was sold to Simon Everenden of Cliffe near Lewes. In the 1650s the forge was in the occupation of John Newnham. In 1664, the forge was lease by Jeremy Johnson Jr of Charlwood. In 1672, woodland next to the pond was referred to as [...] "Hammerwood" [...] also known as [...] "Wire Wood" [...] thus indicating a drawing mill. John Newnham died in 1707, and his wife died in 1719, but the forge was known as [...] "Mr Johnson's Forge" [...] in 1717. At that time the output from the forge was some [...] per annum. [...] By 1729 the forge was in the occupation of Thomas Stanford, who was converting sows from Heathfield furnace at Woodcock Forge. Stanford does not seem to have had any connections with the Wealden iron industry after 1738. In 1742 Samuel Baker was in occupation, followed by Edward Raby and Alexander Master in 1758. They were supplying the Board of Ordnance with several gauges of bar iron, staff iron and <b>rolled</b> <b>plate.</b> Raby & Master were bankrupt in 1764. Edward Raby died in 1771, and the forge was taken over by his son Alexander until 1774, when the Government forced him to give up Woodcock furnace in a wrangle over the size of his moulds. Joseph Wright and Thomas Pickett took the business, but it is thought that the Hammer Mill ceased to be used c.1787. In 1800, the name Wire Mill is first used.|$|E

40|$|Diagnosing catheter-related {{bloodstream}} infection (CRBSI) still often involves tip culture. The conventional method is the semiquantitative <b>roll</b> <b>plate</b> method. However, {{the use of}} a quantitative sonication technique could have additional value, as it may detect endoluminal microorganisms more easily. Because endoluminal infection tends to occur in long-term central venous catheters, we compared both techniques for patients with long-term tunnelled catheters. For 313 consecutive Hickman catheter tips from 279 hematological patients, colonization detection rates were compared by performing both techniques in a random order, using conventional detection cutoffs. Additionally, for the subgroup of patients with clinical suspicion of CRBSI (n = 89), the diagnostic values of both techniques were compared. The overall tip colonization rate was 25 %. For each technique, the detection rate tended to be better if that technique was performed first. The diagnostic performance for the subgroup of patients with clinical suspicion of CRBSI was limited and not different for both methods. Sensitivity and specificity were 45 % and 84 %, respectively, for sonication versus 35 % and 90 %, respectively, for the <b>roll</b> <b>plate</b> technique. The fact that 35 of 40 patients with CRBSI received antimicrobial therapy before catheter removal and tip culture, in an attempt to salvage the catheter, may partly explain this poor performance. No differences were observed when catheters were stratified according to in situ time below or above the median of 4 weeks. The sonication culture technique was not better than the <b>roll</b> <b>plate</b> method to diagnose tip colonization or CRBSI in patients with long-term tunnelled catheters. Copyrigh...|$|R
50|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Mill, Roach was able to introduce a number of innovations into the industry which reduced time and cut costs.

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{clinical}} trial, 248 triple-lumen catheters {{were removed from}} patients in an intensive care unit, and their tip and subcutaneous segments were cultured by both the sonication and <b>roll</b> <b>plate</b> methods; for 191 of these catheters, flush cultures of all three catheter lumens were also performed. Previously published quantitative endpoints were used to define significant catheter colonization. By using a composite index as a definition of colonization (any of the seven types of cultures meeting quantitative criteria), sonication of the subcutaneous segment was the most sensitive at detecting colonization (58 %), followed by sonication of the catheter tip (53 %). Sonication of both the subcutaneous and tip segments was 20 % more sensitive than sonication of an adjacent catheter segment by the <b>roll</b> <b>plate</b> method (P < 0. 05). The greater sensitivity of the sonication method {{could be attributed to}} its greater ability than the <b>roll</b> <b>plate</b> method to detect catheter lumen colonization (82 versus 57 %, respectively; P = 0. 01). A greater number of positive catheter segment cultures were found for colonized catheters from patients with associated bacteremia than for colonized catheters from patients without bacteremia (57 versus 37 %; P = 0. 004), making any culture method more likely to identify them. For catheters with significant colonization of only one site, the localization was as follows: 36. 7 % subcutaneous segment, 36. 7 % catheter lumen, and 26. 6 % tip segment. These findings suggest that the current practice of culturing a single segment of a central vascular catheter is inadequate and needs to be reexamined. They further suggest that initial colonization of the catheter lumen and tip segments may be more important than previously thought and may require a change in thinking of strategies designed to prevent catheter infection...|$|R

50|$|Aluminium alloys (or {{aluminum}} alloys; see spelling differences) are alloys {{in which}} aluminium (Al) is the predominant metal. The typical alloying elements are copper, magnesium, manganese, silicon, tin and zinc. There are two principal classifications, namely casting alloys and wrought alloys, {{both of which}} are further subdivided into the categories heat-treatable and non-heat-treatable. About 85% of aluminium is used for wrought products, for example <b>rolled</b> <b>plate,</b> foils and extrusions. Cast aluminium alloys yield cost-effective products due to the low melting point, although they generally have lower tensile strengths than wrought alloys. The most important cast aluminium alloy system is Al-Si, where the high levels of silicon (4.0-13%) contribute to give good casting characteristics. Aluminium alloys are widely used in engineering structures and components where light weight or corrosion resistance is required.|$|E
5000|$|For {{much of the}} Victorian [...] "age of steam", {{the only}} {{material}} used for boilermaking was the highest grade of wrought iron, with assembly by rivetting.

In the 20th century, design practice instead moved towards the use of steel, which is stronger and cheaper, with welded construction, which is quicker and requires less labour. It should be noted, however, that wrought iron boilers corrode far slower than their modern-day steel counterparts, and are less susceptible to localized pitting and stress-corrosion. This makes the longevity of older wrought-iron boilers far superior to those of welded steel boilers.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} initiates a {{study of}} the mechanics of four <b>roll</b> <b>plate</b> bending and provides a methodology to investigate the process experimentally. To carry out the research a suitable model bender was designed and constructed. The model bender was comprehensively instrumented with ten load cells, three torquemeters and a tachometer. A rudimentary analysis of the four roll pre-bending mode considered the three critical bending operations. The analysis also gave an assessment of the model bender capacity for the design stage. The analysis indicated that an increase in the coefficient of friction in the contact region of the pinch <b>rolls</b> and the <b>plate</b> would reduce the pinch resultant force required to end a plate to a particular bend radius. The mechanisms involved in the four <b>roll</b> <b>plate</b> bending process were investigated and a mathematical model evolved to determine the mechanics of four <b>roll</b> thin <b>plate</b> bending. A theoretical and experimental investigation was conducted for the bending of HP 30 aluminium plates in both single and multipass bending modes. The study indicated that the multipass plate bending mechanics of the process varied according to the number of bending passes executed and the step decrement of the anticipated finished bend radius in any two successive passes (i. e. the bending route). Experimental results for single pass bending indicated that the rollers normally exert a higher bending load for the steady-continous bending with the pre-inactive side roll oper?tive. For the pre-bending mode and the steady-continous bending mode with the pre-active side roll operative, the former exerted the higher loads. The single pass results also indicated that the force on the side roll, the torque and power steadily increased as the anticipated bend radius decreased. Theoretical predictions for the plate internal resistance to accomplish finished bend radii of between 2500 mm and 500 mm for multipass bending HP 30 aluminium plates, suggested that there was a certain bending route which would effectively optimise the bender capacity...|$|R
