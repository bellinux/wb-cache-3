25|$|In 1994, China and Mongolia {{signed a}} treaty wherein both promised to <b>respect</b> <b>each</b> other's {{territorial}} integrity. In the same year, the Inner Mongolia Communist Party explicitly repudiated the Greater Mongolia idea, citing {{the threat to}} China's unity and the likely dominance of Mongolia in such a union. Because {{of the existence of}} an independent Mongolian state, Inner Mongols have generally not aspired to an independent state of their own, and what little separatist sentiment in Inner Mongolia aspires to union with independent Mongolia. The feelings are not reciprocated, as the history and geography of China are not taught in Mongolian schools, and knowledge of the Inner Mongols in Mongolia is low.Similarly to the Inner Mongolian government, high-ranking Buryat officials have reacted to the Greater Mongolia idea by rejecting that Buryats are Mongols at all. Since the normalization of Sino-Mongolian relations in 1994, the Mongolian government does not support Greater Mongolian nationalism, but it tolerates organizations in Mongolia which do, such as the Mongolian newspaper Il Tovchuu. In 2002, the Republic of China (Taiwan) recognized Mongolia's independence, and established informal relations with Mongolia. Various small organizations in Mongolia advocate a Greater Mongolia.|$|E

500|$|The {{purpose of}} the Pact, {{directed}} against an unnamed power presumed to be the United States, was to deter that power from supporting Britain, thereby not only strengthening Germany's and Italy's cause in the North African Campaign and the Mediterranean theatre, but also weakening British colonies in South-East Asia in advance of a Japanese invasion. The treaty stated that the three countries would <b>respect</b> <b>each</b> other's [...] "leadership" [...] in their respective spheres of influence, and would assist each other if attacked by an outside party. However, already-ongoing conflicts, as of {{the signing of the}} Pact, were explicitly excluded. With this defensive terminology, aggression {{on the part of a}} member state toward a non-member state would result in no obligations under the Pact. These limitations can be interpreted as a symptom of the German-Japanese relations of that time being driven by mutual self-interest, underpinned by the shared militarist, expansionist and nationalistic ideologies of their respective governments.|$|E
