40|$|Abstract—For Seismic design, it is {{important}} to estimate, maximum lateral displacement (inelastic displacement) of the structures due to sever earthquakes for several reasons. Seismic design provisions estimate the maximum roof and storey drifts occurring in major earthquakes by amplifying the drifts of the structures obtained by elastic analysis subjected to seismic design load, with a coefficient named “displacement amplification factor” which is greater than one. Here, this coefficient depends on various parameters, such as ductility and overstrength factors. The present research aims to evaluate the value <b>of</b> the displacement <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> in seismic design codes and then tries to propose a value to estimate the maximum lateral structural displacement from sever earthquakes, without using non-linear analysis. In seismic codes, since the displacement amplification is related to “force reduction factor ” hence; this aspect has been accepted in the current study. Meanwhile, two methodologies are applied to evaluate the value <b>of</b> displacement <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> and its relation with the force reduction factor. In the first methodology, which is applied for all structures, the ratio <b>of</b> displacement <b>amplification</b> and force reduction factors is determined directly. Whereas, in the second methodology that is applicable just for R/C moment resisting frame, the ratio is obtained by calculating both factors, separately. The acquired results of these methodologies are alike and estimate the ratio of two factors from 1 to 1. 2. The results indicate that the ratio <b>of</b> the displacement <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> and the force reduction factor differs to those proposed by seismic provisions such as NEHRP, IBC and Iranian seismic code (standard no. 2800).

40|$|Abstract The {{surficial}} geology of {{the city}} of Ottawa primarily consists of soft soil sediments with low shear-wave velocities (∼ 150 m=s) underlain by hard bedrock with very large shear-wave velocities (∼ 2700 m=s). Earthquake recordings show unusually large seismic amplification values for weak motion. These unusually large seismic <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> were reconfirmed with the earthquake spectral ratio method using two stations, the horizontal-to-vertical earthquake spectral ratio method using a single station, and the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique using back-ground noise. These findings were the motivation for carrying out an extensive site response analysis, using finite element modeling (FEM), {{as a part of the}} seismic microzonation studies for the city of Ottawa. The FEM results confirmed the large amplification ratios for weak-motion recordings. FEM analysis was also carried out using a selection of strong-motion time series for the study area. The combined effect of the soil–bedrock acoustic impedance contrast and the level of ground shaking on the variation <b>of</b> soil <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> for the fundamental frequency were inves-tigated. The maximum value <b>of</b> the soil <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> for the fundamental fre-quency increased with increasing impedance contrast ratios until the soil/bedrock acoustic impedance contrast ratio reached values that were usually greater than 12; however, the change in peak amplification was much less with subsequent increases in the contrast ratio beyond that value. As expected, the value <b>of</b> the soil <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> for the fundamental frequency decreased with increasing peak ground accel-eration (PGA) of the input motion due to nonlinear soil damping. Finally, for the Ottawa region, a mathematical model is suggested for soil <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> at the fundamental frequency, as a function of the soil/bedrock acoustic impedance con-trast ratio and the PGA of the input motion...|$|R
