40|$|Objective: A time {{motion study}} {{to check the}} {{efficiency}} of the workload, the facilities, and the providers and the reasons for identified delays in women with obstetric emergencies with the aim of making motherhood safer for developing countries. Materials and Methods: A client flow chart was used to collect time <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> respondents at labour ward and the time of the various activities were noted. Structured questionnaires were also used. Data analysis was done using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) Software. Using EPI-INFO Statcalc Feature, further analysis was employed using Yates Correction of Continuity χ 2 to measure association between demographic characteristics and feto-maternal outcome. Results: Ninety-six women with obstetric emergencies at the labour wards of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex were studied. Delays in delivery care occurred mostly in subjects requiring emergency caesarean section. There were theatre related and care givers related factors. The major cause of delays was inadequate operating theatre space and/or inconsistent labour ward theatre power supply. Delays between decision and commencement of caesarean section had a significant relationship with perinatal and maternal mortality (p-value= 0. 001). Demographic characteristics of the women did not have any significance impact with maternal outcome but low level of education and religious persuasions impacted negatively on perinatal outcome (p< 0. 05). Discussion: Phase 3 delays occurred in this hospital with a resultant increase in maternal and perinatal mortality i...|$|R

5000|$|Bengalis {{had been}} present in Britain {{as early as the}} 19th century. The {{earliest}} <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrivals</b> from the region that is known today as Bangladesh (was British India) are of Sylheti cooks in London during 1873, in the employment of the East India Company, who travelled to the UK as lascars on ships to work in restaurants. Some ancestors of British Bangladeshis went to the UK before World War I. Author Caroline Adams records that in 1925 a lost Bengali man was searching for other Bengali settlers in London. These first few arrivals started the process of [...] "chain migration" [...] mainly from one region of Bangladesh, Sylhet, which led to substantial numbers of people migrating from rural areas of the region, creating links between relatives in Britain and the region. They mainly immigrated to the United Kingdom to find work, achieve a better standard of living, and to escape conflict. During the pre-state years, the 1950s and 1960s, Bengali men immigrated to London in search of employment. Most settled in Tower Hamlets, particularly around Spitalfields and Brick Lane. In 1971, Bangladesh (until then known as [...] "East Pakistan") fought for its independence from Pakistan in what was known as the Bangladesh Liberation War. In the region of Sylhet, this led some people to join the Mukti Bahini, or Liberation Army.|$|R
40|$|Four {{species of}} mole crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae) are {{known from the}} West Indies: Neocurtilla hexadactyla (Perty), Scapteriscus abbreviatus Scudder, S. didactylus (Latreille), and S. imitatus Nickle and Castner. All are adventive (not native). We {{document}} their distributions in West Indian islands/countries by use <b>of</b> <b>records</b> from the literature and examination of specimens. Scapteriscus abbreviatus has been suggested to have arrived in, and been transported about the West Indies in ship ballast (immigration). Based on <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> {{in various parts of}} the West Indies and the species’ inability to fly, this suggestion seems reasonable. Scapteriscus imitatus apparently was released in Puerto Rico as a result of mistaken identification (introduction – arriving with assistance from humans – although inadvertent), and has not expanded its range in the West Indies. Although the principal mode of dispersal for the other two species also has been suggested to be ship ballast, we present an alternative based on flight which would seem at least equally as plausible. We suggest that S. didactylus could have dispersed by flight from South America through the Lesser Antilles; likewise N. hexadactyla probably from the Yucatan Peninsula to Cuba, and from South America northward through the Lesser Antilles, in at least some localities assisted by wind. Our zoogeographical alternative, if correct, means that the natural range expansions of these latter two species began very long ago and without human assistance – they were not introduced recently to the West Indies...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an optimization method to approximate the <b>arrival</b> rate function <b>of</b> a non-homogeneous Poisson process based on observed arrival data. We estimate the function by cubic splines, using an optimization model {{based on the}} maximum likelihood principle. A critical feature of the model is that the splines are constrained to be everywhere nonnegative. We enforce these constraints by using a characterization of nonnegative polynomials by positive semidefinite matrices. We also describe versions of our model that allow for periodic arrival rate functions and input data of limited time precision. We formulate the estimation problem as a convex nonlinear program, and solve it with standard nonlinear optimization packages. We present numerical results using both an actual <b>record</b> <b>of</b> e-mail <b>arrivals</b> {{over a period of}} sixty weeks, and artificially generated data sets. We also present a cross-validation procedure for determining an appropriate number of spline knots to model a set <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> observations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Time Transfer by Laser Link (T 2 L 2) is a {{very high}} {{resolution}} time transfer technique based on the <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> times <b>of</b> laser pulses at the satellite. T 2 L 2 was designed to achieve time stability {{in the range of}} 1 ps over 1000 s and an accuracy better than 100 ps. The project is in operation onboard the Jason- 2 satellite since June 2008. The principle is based on the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) technology; it uses the input of 20 – 25 SLR stations of the international laser network which participate in the tracking. This paper focuses on the data reduction process which was developed specifically to transform the raw information given by both space instrument and ground network: first to identify the triplets (ground and onboard epochs and time of flight of the laser pulse), second to estimate a usable product in terms of ground-to-space time transfer (including instrumental corrections), and thirdly to produce synchronization between any pair of remote ground clocks. In describing the validation of time synchronizations, the paper opens a way for monitoring the time difference between ultra-stable clocks thanks to a laser link at a few ps level for Common View passes. It highlights however that without accurately characterizing the onboard oscillator of Jason- 2 and knowing the unavailability of time calibrations of SLR stations generally, time transfer over intercontinental distances remain difficult to be accurately estimated...|$|R

40|$|In Blade Tip Timing several sensors {{installed}} circumferentially in {{the casing}} {{are used to}} <b>record</b> times <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (TOA) and observe deflections of blade tips. This paper aims to demonstrate methodology of model-based processing of aliased data. It focuses on the blade vibration excited by the forces synchronous with engine rotation, which are called integral responses. The driven harmonic oscillator with single degree of freedom (SDOF) is used to analyse blade vibration measured by tip-timing sensors during engine deceleration. When integral engine order EO is known, the linear sine fitting techniques {{can be used to}} process data from sensors to estimate amplitude, phase and frequency of blade vibration in each rotation. The oscillator model is implemented in MATLAB and used to generate resonance curves and simulate blade responses observed with tip sensors, installed in the axial compressor. Generated TOA data are fitted to the sine function to estimate vibration parameters. The validated procedure is then employed to analyze real test data...|$|R
