She has a French mother and a British father, David Blatt (known also as {{author of the book}} Manchester United <b>Ruined</b> <b>My</b> Wife), whose Jewish {{ancestors}} were from Poland and Russia and a younger sister named Jasmine. She was brought up in both the UK and France. In 1986, Blatt was diagnosed as having scoliosis. Since her parents were not satisfied with the treatment for the condition in the United Kingdom they decided to move to France, where a specialist inserted three metal rods in her back.|$|E
500|$|Hańska {{lived with}} Balzac's mother {{for a time}} after his death, in the house he had {{spent so much time}} and expense furnishing. The elder Mme. Balzac moved in with a friend after several months, and Hańska {{approached}} the remains of her late husband's writing. Several works had been left incomplete, and publishers inquired about releasing a final edition of his grand collection La Comédie humaine. Hańska sponsored new editions of his works and was involved in editing some of them, even adding occasional content. Balzac's debt, meanwhile, still exceeded 200,000 francs, which Hańska paid while also providing for his mother's living expenses. One of her letters at the time gives voice to her frustrations: [...] "In nursing my husband's incurable malady I <b>ruined</b> <b>my</b> health, just as I have <b>ruined</b> <b>my</b> private fortune in accepting the inheritance of debts and embarrassments which he left me." [...] Anna and Jerzy moved into a nearby house in Paris.|$|E

500|$|From about 1920 Frise {{shared an}} {{office with the}} {{journalist}} and Vimy ridge veteran Greg Clark (1892–77). [...] They became friends, and Frise began providing colour illustrations to Clark's tales in the Star of the pair's misadventures in Toronto—Frise tall and gangly, and Clark short and stout. [...] A selection appeared in a volume titled Which We Did in 1936. [...] Frise talked of their blunderings to the Star: [...] "We've fried eggs on the city hall steps. We caulked my house and flooded the parlor with cement. I once let Greg persuade {{me to get a}} steam shovel to do my spring digging and <b>ruined</b> <b>my</b> garden.

2500|$|That evening’s {{theatrical}} {{presentation was}} the premiere performance of Mam'zelle Champagne. [...] During the show’s finale, [...] "I Could Love A Million Girls", Thaw approached White, produced a pistol, standing some two feet from his target, said, [...] "You've <b>ruined</b> <b>my</b> wife", and fired three shots at White, hitting him {{twice in the}} face and once in his upper left shoulder, killing him instantly. [...] Part of White’s face was torn away, {{and the rest of his}} features were unrecognizable, blackened by gunpowder. [...] The crowd's initial reaction was one of good cheer, as elaborate party tricks among the upper echelon of New York society were common at the time. However, when it became apparent that White was dead, hysteria ensued.|$|E
2500|$|... {{an episode}} of the crime {{television}} series , portrays a fictionalized version of the Gamergate controversy, including a character whom some observers said resembled Sarkeesian and whose story seemed based on those of women subject to the harassment campaign. The 2015 documentary film GTFO analyzed issues of sexism and harassment in video gaming. The film's director, Shannon Sun-Higginson, stated Gamergate was [...] "a terrible, terrible thing, but it's actually symptomatic of a wider, cultural, systemic problem". The Gamergate situation was covered {{as part of a}} larger topic of online harassment of women in the June 21, 2015, episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. The impact of the Gamergate controversy on Brianna Wu was the subject of the March 16, 2016, episode of The Internet <b>Ruined</b> <b>My</b> Life.|$|E
2500|$|For many years, John Elway was bitter, on both a {{personal}} level and {{on behalf of his}} team, about the touchdown being allowed: [...] "This was an insult to college football... They [...] <b>ruined</b> <b>my</b> last game as a college football player." [...] The Play cost Stanford an invitation to the Hall of Fame Classic, in addition to a winning season, and Elway completed his college career having never played in a bowl game. Geiger said that the loss cost Elway the Heisman Trophy. Elway would nevertheless enjoy a tremendously successful NFL career, winning two Super Bowls with the Denver Broncos, and was inducted into the Pro Football and College Football Halls of Fame. Years later, Elway came to terms with The Play, stating that [...] "each year it gets a little funnier." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} {{completed}} {{one day before}} it debuted at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival in the 2,400-seat Grand Auditorium. After the screening, it received [...] "wild cheering" [...] from the audience. When Jury President Bernardo Bertolucci announced Wild at Heart as the Palme d'Or winner at the awards ceremony, the boos almost drowned out the cheers, with film critic Roger Ebert leading the vocal detractors. Barry Gifford remembers {{that there was a}} prevailing mood that the media was hoping Lynch would fail. [...] "All kinds of journalists were trying to cause controversy and have me say something like 'This is nothing like the book' or 'He <b>ruined</b> <b>my</b> book'. I think everybody from Time magazine to What's On In London was disappointed when I said 'This is fantastic. This is wonderful. It's like a big, dark, musical comedy'".|$|E
2500|$|... "The Twist" [...] had {{previously}} peaked at #16 on the Billboard {{rhythm and blues}} chart, in the 1959 version recorded by its author, Hank Ballard, whose band The Midnighters first performed the dance on stage. Checker's [...] "Twist", however, was a nationwide smash, aided by his many appearances on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, the Top 10 American Bandstand ranking of the song, and the teenagers on the show who enjoyed dancing the Twist. The song was so ubiquitous that Checker felt that his critics thought that he could only succeed with dance records typecasting him as a dance artist. Checker later lamented:"...in a way, [...] "The Twist" [...] really <b>ruined</b> <b>my</b> life. I {{was on my way}} to becoming a big nightclub performer, and [...] "The Twist" [...] just wiped it out... It got so out of proportion. No one ever believes I have talent." [...] By 1965 alone, [...] "The Twist" [...] had sold over 15 million copies, and was awarded multiple gold discs by the RIAA.|$|E
2500|$|Living under reduced {{circumstances}} in Zürich, Maria Alexandrovna was reunited {{with her two}} eldest daughters Marie, Queen of Romania, and Victoria Melita, Grand Duchess of Russia {{who had been on}} the opposite side during the war. In July 1920, she wrote: [...] "I am too utterly disgusted with the present state of the world and mankind in general... They have destroyed and <b>ruined</b> <b>my</b> beloved Russia, my much-loved Germany". She was a broken woman, her figure, always plump, became thin and her hands trembling. Although she had been affected by gastric troubles, her death came unexpectedly. [...] Eight days after her sixty-seventh birthday, on 25 October 1920, the only child of Tsar Alexander II to survive the Russian Revolution died in her sleep of a heart attack. She [...] was buried in the ducal mausoleum at [...] in Coburg besides her husband and their son. [...] " [...] She was profoundly religious", her eldest daughter wrote, [...] "I hope God will not disappoint her as most things and beings did in this life".|$|E

2500|$|The {{restoration}} of the vase began in June 1988, and was filmed by the BBC History and Archaeology Unit. Deconstruction of the vase was achieved by wrapping it inside and out with blotting paper and letting it sit in a glass desiccator injected with solvents for three days, {{at the end of}} which it was separated into 189 pieces. After removing the remnants of the old adhesive and cleaning the fragments, an epoxy adhesive, Hxtal NYL, was used in conjunction with an acrylic resin to join the pieces. Although efforts were made to avoid [...] "trap-outs", where the placing of a fragment prevents the next from fitting in, Williams and Smith left for Christmas in 1988 [...] "not knowing whether they would be able to fit the last few shards without having to dismantle six months' work." [...] These fears proved unfounded; [...] "fter several weeks of assembling and reassembling the top half of the Vase, the final fragment of rim dropped in and fitted perfectly." [...] At the end of nine months' work, only 17 minuscule fragments remained unplaced, rather than the 34 that were omitted from the previous restoration. After filling in the cracks with coloured resin, Williams gave his verdict: [...] "It's OK... <b>ruined</b> <b>my</b> Christmas." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{events at}} Samu {{triggered}} large-scale anti-Hashemite protests in the West Bank {{for what they}} perceieved as Hussein's incompetency for defending them against Israel: rioters attacked government offices, chanted pro-Nasser slogans, and called on Hussein {{to have the same}} fate as Nuri As-Saidthe Iraqi prime minister who had been killed and mutilated in 1958 along with the Iraqi royal family. Jordanians believed that after this incident, Israel would march on the West Bank whether or not Jordan joined the war. Perception of King Hussein's efforts to come to peaceful terms with Israel led to great dissatisfaction among some Arab leaders. President Nasser of Egypt denounced Hussein as an [...] "imperialist lackey". In a meeting with American officials, Hussein, sometimes with tears in his eyes, said: [...] "The growing split between the East Bank and the West Bank has <b>ruined</b> <b>my</b> dreams," [...] and, [...] "There is near despair in the army and the army no longer has confidence in me." [...] Hussein travelled to Cairo on 30May 1967 and hastily signed an Egyptian-Jordanian mutual defense treaty, returning home to cheering crowds. Shlaim argues that Hussein had possessed options, but had made two mistakes: the first was in putting the Jordanian army under Egyptian command; the second was in allowing the entry of Iraqi troops into Jordan, which raised Israeli suspicions against Jordan. Egyptian general Abdul Munim Riad arrived in Jordan to command its army pursuant to the pact signed with Egypt.|$|E
