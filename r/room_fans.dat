50|$|Thermal {{comfort of}} a {{learning}} space {{is important for}} student comfort, and therefore learning. This is affected by several factors: ambient room temperature, air movement (via open windows, mechanical ventilation, drafts across cold surfaces, and <b>room</b> <b>fans),</b> and solar exposure. Insulating windows, shaded windows, and careful placement of ventilation ducts can all affect the comfort.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the ceiling}} fans rotate much more slowly than most {{electric}} desk fans. They cool people effectively by introducing slow movement into the otherwise still, hot air of a <b>room.</b> <b>Fans</b> never actually cool air, unlike air-conditioning equipment, but use significantly less power (cooling air is thermodynamically expensive). Conversely, a ceiling fan {{can also be used}} to reduce the stratification of warm air in a room by forcing it down to affect both occupants' sensations and thermostat readings, thereby improving climate control energy efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Fans {{provide a}} major {{opportunity}} for buildings {{in that they}} enhance both energy efficiency and occupant comfort. Very low-wattage fans (3 watts) producing 1 m/s (2 mph) air movement near each occupant are capable of offsetting a 6 ºF (3 K) increase in indoor air temperature, while improving the comfort perceived by the occupants. Increasing the indoor temperature reduces a building’s total HVAC energy about 5 % per degree F, or 10 % per degree C, and even more in some climate zones if the higher indoor temperature permits natural ventilation or evaporative cooling systems to be used instead of compressor-based cooling. The opportunities for new design approaches and new fan products are considerable. <b>Room</b> <b>fans</b> have many applications in both new and retrofit designs since they do not involve other HVAC systems, can be easily turned on and off (as with occupancy sensors or wireless controls), yet they can provide an instantaneous cooling effect for the occupant. They strengthen the effectiveness of other energy-efficient measures which may be inherently slow-acting or unpredictable, such as radiant ceilings/floors, and buildings designed to rely on natural ventilation. The technologies involved are especially applicable in California climates. The overall goal {{of this study is}} to encourage the broader adoption of <b>room</b> <b>fans,</b> especially ceiling-integrated fans, in commercial building design. The project addresses a wide range of topics ranging from fundamental human subject studies to new product design and the removal of barriers to implementation in comfort and energy performance standards. 11 subprojects were accomplished...|$|E
40|$|In warm environments, <b>room</b> <b>fans</b> {{can provide}} comfort using {{substantially}} less energy than air- conditioning. The savings are greater if the fans {{make it possible}} to successfully condition the building with natural ventilation or evaporative cooling systems, instead of chillers. Although there are many laboratory studies of comfort using desk fans and personalized fans, tests for ceiling fans are rare, mainly in early studies from the 1980 s. This study examines the cooling effect of a low-wattage ceiling fan on occupants when air comes from different directions with different speeds. We conducted 96 human subject tests in an environmental chamber. Sixteen college students each experienced 6 air movement conditions: two different air speeds and three different air directions between fan and subject: from front, side, or right above the head (total eleven configurations). The difference in thermal comfort and thermal sensation generated by fixed and oscillating fans was also investigated. The temperature and humidity conditions for the tests were 28 °C and 50 % RH. It was found that the majority of subject (70 %) perceive the thermal environment without fans comfortable. This number rise to 100 % for some configuration with fans. Our subject found that the oscillating air movement had no effect in terms of improved thermal comfort or thermal sensation, but it greatly improves their air quality perception. The subjects did not report any dry eyes discomfort for any of the eleven configurations...|$|E

50|$|Hugh and Leona Rank House is a {{historic}} home located in Marion Township, Jasper County, Indiana.

5000|$|Unlike air conditioners, which cool <b>rooms,</b> <b>fans</b> cool people. Ceiling fans {{increase}} {{air speed}} at the occupant level, which facilitates more efficient heat rejection, cooling the occupant, {{rather than the}} space. Elevated air speed increases the rate of convective and evaporative heat loss from the body, thus making the occupant feel cooler without changing the dry bulb temperature of the air.|$|R

25|$|At 3:30p.m. on February 13, 1966, a fire {{broke out}} in a greasy flue {{in the kitchen of}} the {{terminal}} building's second-floor restaurant, The Sky <b>Room.</b> <b>Fanned</b> by gusty winds, the fire spread through the terminal and control tower. Controllers in the tower were able to escape on an aerial ladder and air traffic was diverted to nearby Van Nuys Airport and Los Angeles International Airport for several hours. A controller communicated with aircraft using the radio in a light airplane belonging to Sky Roamers Air Travel, a flying club whose hangar was just east of the control tower. The fire, contained by about 6:30p.m., caused an estimated $2 million in damages to the terminal, tower and equipment in the tower. No injuries were reported.|$|R

50|$|As extreme as MAV {{specifications}} were, a team under Ilan Kroo at Stanford University {{worked on}} an even more extreme design {{in the form of}} a centimeter-wide four-rotor mesicopter using microcircuit fabrication techniques. The work was funded by NASA. Design of such a small aircraft was constrained by the fact that at such scales, the air becomes a highly viscous medium, or in aerodynamic terms a mesicopter had a low Reynolds number. Basic aerodynamics of the mesicopter were defined by a cycle of computer simulation, followed by tests of model components. The research led to mesicopter rotor designs where the rotor looked much more like the blades of an ordinary <b>room</b> <b>fan</b> than the rotor of a conventional helicopter. Propeller designs did not achieve desired efficiency and the Mesicopter was never able to lift the weight of its own energy source.|$|R

Unlike her sister ships, no aircraft hangar was added because that would have pushed her over the Washington Naval Treaty limits, but her catapult was replaced with a more powerful one capable of handling the heavier Supermarine Walrus flying boat.|$|R
60|$|Bertha, in rich new garments, {{seemed as}} {{alien to the}} scene as any fine lady visiting among the slums. She was struggling, too, between disgust of her sister-in-law's slovenly house and untidy dress, and the good humor, tender {{sentiment}} and innate motherliness of her nature. There was charm in her voice and in her big gray eyes. Irish to the core, she could storm at one child and coo with another an instant later. She was like Mart, or rather Mart became every moment more of her kind and less of the bold and remorseless desperado he had once seemed to be. The deeper they dug into the past the more of his essential kinship to this woman he discovered. He greeted her children with kindly interest, leaving a dollar in each chubby, dirty fist, and when McArdle came into the <b>room</b> <b>Fan</b> had quite conquered her awe of Bertha's finery.|$|R

500|$|Water {{spread to}} the {{centreline}} boiler room, which started to flood from below, and power was lost shipwide when the boiler uptakes became choked; Ark Royal had no backup diesel generators. About half {{an hour after the}} explosion, the carrier appeared to stabilise. Admiral Somerville, determined to save Ark Royal, ordered damage control parties back to the carrier before taking the battleship Malaya to Gibraltar to organise salvage efforts. The damage control parties re-lit a boiler, restoring power to the bilge pumps. The destroyer [...] came alongside to provide power and additional pumps, while Swordfish aircraft from Gibraltar flew overhead to supplement anti-submarine patrols. The tug Thames arrived from Gibraltar at 20:00 and attached a tow line to Ark Royal, but the flooding had caused the ship to list more severely. Rising water reached the boiler <b>room</b> <b>fan</b> flat, an uninterrupted compartment running the width of the ship. This forced the shutdown of the restored boiler.|$|R
