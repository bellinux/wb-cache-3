40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} change in riskiness of eight Norwegian hydro power municipalities’ {{investments}} in complex financial products offered by Citigroup through the brokerage firm Terra Securities AS during the period 2001 - 2007. The investments were financed by restructuring the municipalities` annual <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> <b>concession</b> fees and power. Using Monte Carlo simulations, this paper estimates {{the change in}} riskiness by comparing the Cash Flow at Risk between two portfolios comprising of (1) restructuring the concession fees and power and investing in Credit Linked Notes, and (2) no restructuring of the concession. Evidence of increased riskiness is found for the eight municipalities when entering into these products...|$|R

50|$|In 1942, the {{railroad}} {{went out of}} business and the newspaper took over its offices. Four years later, in 1946, the Sanfords leased the theater to the Kallet chain on the condition that they keep the <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> the <b>concession</b> stand, and Kallet invest in improvements. Two years later, the chain began a substantial remodeling of the interior, filling in the orchestra pit to add more seats. The wood trusses that break the roof plane were added at this time.|$|R

50|$|Ground {{was broken}} on the {{building}} in July 1953 and the project cost a total of $1.3 million, with work proceeding after a protest filed with the Indiana State Board of Tax Commissioners was rejected. When the field house was opened on November 24, 1954, the facility was the largest high school gym in the United States. In its initial season of operation, the gym generated $57,500 in <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> ticket sales, <b>concessions</b> and parking fees from the 134,000 fans who attended high school games, and the many more who attended wrestling matches, ice shows and watched the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|R
50|$|A third {{terminal}} {{for international}} flights {{was completed in}} October 2010. The cost to construct the five-story terminal building and attached 2,300-car parking deck was covered by a private finance initiative process, <b>revenues</b> <b>from</b> duty-free <b>concessions</b> and a facility use charge of ¥2,000 per passenger. Both the Tokyo Monorail and the Keikyū Airport Line added stops at the new terminal, and an international air cargo facility was constructed nearby. The fourth runway (05/23), which is called D Runway, was also completed in 2010, having been constructed via land reclamation {{to the south of}} the existing airfield. This runway was designed to increase Haneda's operational capacity from 285,000 movements to 407,000 movements per year, permitting increased frequencies on existing routes, as well as routes to new destinations. In particular, Haneda would offer additional slots to handle 60,000 overseas flights a year (30,000 during the day and 30,000 during late night and early morning hours).|$|R
50|$|Major League Baseball {{also has}} {{policies}} improving the competitive balance {{off of the}} field. As {{a part of their}} base plan of revenue sharing, each team sends in 31% of their local net revenues into a putative pool. Local net revenues is described as gross <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> ticket sales, <b>concessions,</b> etc. minus central <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> television and radio deals minus actual stadium expenses. This pool will then be distributed equally to all 30 teams, regardless of how much you paid. If you paid more than you were distributed, you were labeled as a payor, but if you were paid more than you contributed, you were labeled as a payee. This system is a direct way for poorer teams to get more money from the richer teams, an effective way to level the competitive balance.|$|R
50|$|Despite a no-cost stadium lease, all <b>revenues</b> <b>from</b> parking, <b>concessions,</b> and TV, {{as well as}} a {{reported}} $25M per year Maryland subsidy, Modell's ownership of the Ravens resulted in continual financial hardships for the team. In late 2002 the NFL took an unusual step and directed Modell to sell his franchise, and in 2003, Modell sold the Ravens to minority owner, Maryland businessman Steve Bisciotti. Under the deal, Modell retained a small interest (approximately 1% share) upon the team's sale as a legal maneuver to avoid a claim by the Andrews trust, which was controlled by family of a former business adviser who sought to collect an estimated $30 million finder's fee upon Modell's sale of the team. The Andrews trust essentially claimed that under a 1963 agreement, Modell owed a finder's fee for his original purchase of the team which was to be paid when Modell sold his entire interest. In July 2005, Modell prevailed in court and defeated the Andrews trust's claim. At the time of sale the franchise's worth was estimated at approximately US$600 million.|$|R
50|$|In {{granting}} stadium subsidies, governments {{claim that}} the new or improved stadiums will bring positive benefits to the city. Proponents tout improvements to the local economy as the primary benefits. The first way this is accomplished is {{through the creation of}} jobs. New stadiums generate construction jobs, and game attendees and team employees increase spending in the area, thereby leading to more jobs created. Supporters further argue that the stadiums attract tourism and businesses that lead to further spending and job creation. All of the increased spending causes a multiplier effect that leads to more spending and job creation and eventually finances the subsidy through increased tax <b>revenues</b> <b>from</b> ticket and <b>concessions</b> sales, improved property values and more spending nearby the stadium.|$|R
50|$|On August 19, 2016, the River Kings' owners {{announced}} that the team would no longer continue operations {{due to lack of}} fan support and the heavy financial burdens of running the team. The owners claimed they had to close their other businesses to keep the team operating during the previous season and they could no longer operate the team. Within 12 hours, the city removed the River Kings logo from center ice, even while the ownership was working to find last-minute financing. The owners announced on August 23 that they were unable to convince any new investors due to the only thing the team could offer would be <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> ticket sales and advertisement as a sponsor. The team could not offer <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> beer or <b>concession</b> stands or discounts on ice time. However, on August 23, the final efforts of a group of fans, led by local Rodney Rivette, had claimed to have raised over $60,000 in pledged commitments since the announcement about folding in the hopes to convince the league to keep the team.|$|R
40|$|The report {{focuses on}} the impacts of special {{autonomy}} in Papua on the forestry sector. It studies the advantages and {{problems associated with the}} current forestry management system. The most significant change following special autonomy for Papua was the introduction of small-scale concession permits granted to community cooperatives, locally known as Kopermas. As a result, CIFOR and the State University of Papua’s research focused on these Kopermas, analyzing data on timber production and <b>revenues</b> <b>from</b> <b>concessions,</b> and determining the flow of benefits to customary communities’ incomes and to regional revenues. The objective was to determine how effectively the Kopermas system has empowered local communities. Using a combination of conventional and participatory/action research methods, the research team evaluated the livelihoods and environmental value of forest resources for local people. We also facilitated stakeholder input into our research findings and analysis. The team also worked with local communities to determine their current capacity for forest management; which mechanisms were used to distribute the benefits from the new system; and how people were involved in decision-making about permit applications and concession management. This research found some direct involvement of local people in forest management and short-term benefits for local communities. However, we also found that the benefits <b>from</b> timber <b>revenues</b> have not been fairly shared among local people and other actors involved in the timber business. As a result, community forestry cooperatives have yet to contribute to equitable and sustainable development for local people. To improve this situation, local stakeholders identified an urgent need to empower customary organizations and individuals by equipping them to manage their own natural resources independently. This will reduce the likelihood that communities are exploited by more powerful stakeholders in the future. Alongside low capacity, facilities and skills for commercial forest management, challenges included low levels of information about government policy, unclear and inconsistent regulations and implementing guidelines, lack of recognition of communities’ rights, and lack of capital for investment. Local people concluded that government institutions and local stakeholders should take a more proactive role to provide the necessary assistance and advice. The government needs to issue and socialize policies with practical and applicable sanctions for non-compliance and to facilitate local involvement in policy making regarding permit issuance and provincial and district spatial planning processes. Coordination and cooperation among the relevant institutions and organizations could also be improved...|$|R
5000|$|Hocquart’s fine {{opinion of}} the La Portes soon changed when it became {{apparent}} that Jean was using his recently acquired familiarity with the Canadian economy for private benefit. On 17 April 1744, the Count de Maurepas informed the Canadian officials that Jean de La Porte was to be given the “fur farm” (la ferme sur la traite des fourrures, i.e. the profits on the taxing of the fur trade) of Lac Alemipigon (Lake Nipigon, Ont.) from that year forward as a reward for his services in New France. In a letter dated a week later, Maurepas confirmed that the La Porte brothers had received also a warrant granting them five-sixths of the fishery of Baie de Phélypeaux (Baie de Brador, Que.) on the death of the current proprietor, François Martel de Brouage. <b>Revenues</b> <b>from</b> the whole <b>concession</b> had been more than 55,000 livres in 1741.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} Shea Stadium {{go way back}} to the Brooklyn Dodgers' and the New York Giants' relocations to the U.S. west coast, which left New York without a National League {{baseball}} team. New York City official Robert Moses tried to interest Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley in the site as the location for a new stadium, but O'Malley refused, unable to agree on location, ownership, and lease terms. O'Malley preferred to pay construction costs himself so he could own the stadium outright. He wanted total control over <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> parking, <b>concessions,</b> and other events. New York City, in contrast, wanted to build the stadium, rent it, and retain the ancillary revenue rights to pay off its construction bonds. Additionally, O'Malley wanted to build his new stadium in Brooklyn, while Moses insisted on Flushing Meadows. When Los Angeles offered O'Malley what the City of New York wouldn't—complete ownership of the facility—he left for southern California in a preemptive bid to install the Dodgers there before a new or existing major league franchise could beat him to it. At the same time, Horace Stoneham moved his New York Giants to the San Francisco Bay Area, ensuring that there would be two National League West Coast teams, and preserving the longstanding rivalry with the Dodgers that continues to this day.|$|R
40|$|Equatorial Guinea {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extraordinary}} countries in the world, if also one of the most obscure. Its tremendous yearly <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> the oil <b>concessions</b> it grants in its Gulf of Guinea territorial waters is little known, but so too is its abysmal record on human rights. The deep-rooted corruption to be found there, on the other hand, with the ruling family of President Teodoro Obiang dominating government and economic enterprises, can probably be assumed but is shocking nonetheless in light of the needs of a native population still largely mired in poverty. This case directly addresses the moral questions involved in working with such a regime, through the eyes of an Amsterdam-based PR and advocacy office that is approached by Equatorial Guinean officials and agrees to do so. Can such involvement be anything other than a cynical money-earning exercise, or is it really possible to influence the behavior of such a regime for the better by working closely with it...|$|R
