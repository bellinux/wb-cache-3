40|$|Successful {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} for simulating some experimental shipboard fires. The experimental fues were staged in Holds 4 and 5 of the Mayo Lykes, a test ship operated by the United States Coast Guard Fire and Safiety Test Detachment at Little Sand Island in Mobile Bay, Alabama. The tests simulated an engine-room or galley fire in the compartment adjacent to simulated hazardous cargo. The purpose of these tests was to determine the effect the fires in Hold 4 had on the cargo in Holds 4 and 5. The simulation is done with CFX, a commercial computational fluid dynamics code. Analyses show that simulations can accurately estimate a maritime fire environment for <b>radioactive</b> materials <b>packaging.</b> Radiative heat transfer dominates the hold-fue environment near the hot bulkhead. Flame temperatures between 800 and 1000 °C give heat fluxes and temperatures typical of the measured fire environment for the simulated <b>radioactive</b> materials <b>package.</b> The simulation predicted the occurrence of flow patterns near the calorimeter (simulated <b>radioactive</b> materials <b>package)</b> similar to those observed during the experiment.

40|$|When heated {{from room}} {{temperature}} to 165 C, some shape memory metal alloys such as titanium-nickel alloys {{have the ability}} to return to a previously defined shape or size with dimensional changes up to 7 %. In contrast, the thermal expansion of most metals over this temperature range is about 0. 1 to 0. 2 %. The dimension change of shape memory alloys, which occurs during a martensite to austenite phase transition, can generate stresses as high as 700 MPa (100 kspi). These properties can be used to create a closure for <b>radioactive</b> materials <b>packages</b> that provides for easy robotic or manual operations and results in reproducible, tamper-proof seals.

40|$|<b>Radioactive</b> {{material}} <b>package</b> containment vessels typically employ bolted closures {{of various}} configurations. Closure bolts must retain {{the lid of}} a package and must maintain required seal loads, while subjected to internal pressure, impact loads and vibration. The need for insuring that the specified preload is achieved in closure bolts for radioactive materials packagings has been a continual subject of concern for both designers and regulatory reviewers. The extensive literature on threaded fasteners provides sound guidance on design and torque specification for closure bolts. The literature also shows the uncertainty associated with use of torque to establish preload is typically between 10 and 35 %. These studies have been performed under controlled, laboratory conditions. The ability to insure required preload in normal service is, consequently, an important question. The study described here investigated the relationship between indicated torque and resulting bolt load for a typical <b>radioactive</b> materials <b>package</b> closure using methods available under normal service conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} radiography {{as a tool for}} evaluating damage to <b>radioactive</b> material <b>packaging</b> subjected to regulatory accident conditions. The Code of Federal Regulations, 10 CFR 71, presents the performance based requirements that must be used in the development (design, fabrication and testing) of a <b>radioactive</b> material <b>packaging.</b> The use of various non-destructive examination techniques in the fabrication of packages is common. One such technique is the use of conventional radiography in the examination of welds. Radiography is conventional in the sense that images are caught one at a time on film stock. Most recently, digital radiography has been used to characterize internal damage to a package subjected to the 30 -foot hypothetical accident conditions (HAC) drop. Digital radiography allows for real time evaluation of the item being inspected. This paper presents a summary discussion of the digital radiographic technique and an example of radiographic results of a 9975 package following the HAC 30 -foot drop...|$|R
40|$|The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA) are {{conducting}} an R&D program {{to improve the}} characterization of long-lived and medium activity (LL-MA) <b>radioactive</b> waste <b>packages.</b> In particular, the amount of toxic elements present in <b>radioactive</b> waste <b>packages</b> must be assessed {{before they can be}} accepted in repository facilities in order to avoid pollution of underground water reserves.

40|$|Recent {{intercontinental}} {{radioactive material}} shipping campaigns have focused public and regulatory {{attention on the}} safety of transport of this material by ocean-going vessels. One major concern is {{the response of the}} vessel and onboard <b>radioactive</b> material (RAM) <b>packages</b> during a severe ship-to-ship collision. These collisions occur at velocities less than the velocity obtained in the Type B package regulatory impact event and the bow of the striking ship is less rigid than the unyielding target used in those tests (Ammerman and Daidola, 1996). This implies that ship impact is not a credible scenario for damaging the <b>radioactive</b> material <b>packages</b> during ship collisions. It is possible, however, for these collisions to generate significant amounts of crush force by the bow of the impacting ship overrunning the package. It is the aim of this paper to determine an upper bound on the magnitude of this crush force taking into account the strength of the radioactive material carrying vessel and any other cargo that may be stowed in the same hold as the radioactive material...|$|R
40|$|Both the American National Standard for Radioactive Materials [...] Leakage Tests on Packages for Shipment (ANSI N 14. 5) and the ISO 12807 : 1996 Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials [...] Leakage Testing on Packages provide {{guidance}} for leakage rate testing {{to show that}} a particular packaging complies with regulatory requirements; both also {{provide guidance}} for determining appropriate acceptance criteria. Recent <b>radioactive</b> <b>packaging</b> designs have incorporated three-O-ring closure seals, the middle O-ring being the containment seal. These designs have the potential for false positive results in leakage rate tests. The volume between the containment O-ring and the inner O-ring is used for the helium gas required for the leakage rate tests, in order to reduce both the amount of helium used and the time required to conduct the tests. A leak detector samples the evacuated volume between the outer O-ring and the containment O-ring. False positive results can have two causes: a large leakage in the containment seal or leakage in the inner seal. This paper describes the problem, together with possible solutions and areas that should be addressed in a Safety Analysis Report for Packaging (SARP) before a particular packaging design can be certified for transport. Ultimately, the SARP should provide justification that the requirements for leakage rate testing procedures, including the length of time needed to conduct the tests, will ensure that the containment closure seal is properly tested...|$|R

Additionally, ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, Subsection NB compliance along with the benefits compared to typical welding of containment vessels will be discussed. SRNL has completed fabrication development and the testing on flow formed containment vessels to demonstrate the use of flow forming as an alternate method of manufacturing a welded 6 -inch diameter containment vessel currently used in the 9975 and 9977 <b>radioactive</b> material shipping <b>packaging.</b> Material testing and nondestructive evaluation of the flow formed parts demonstrate compliance to the minimum material requirements specified in applicable parts of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section II. Destructive burst testing shows comparable results {{to that of a}} welded design. The benefits of flow forming as compared to typical welding of containment vessels are significant: dimensional control is improved due to no weld distortion; less final machining; weld fit-up issues associated with pipes and pipe caps are eliminated; post-weld non-destructive testing (i. e., radiography and die penetrant tests) is not necessary; and less fabrication steps are required. Results presented in this paper indicate some of the benefits in adapting flow forming to design of future <b>radioactive</b> material shipping <b>packages</b> containment vessels...|$|R

The technique has the ability to accurately capture the response of the packages to accident environments required by the regulations. The best method of demonstrating this ability is via a series of benchmark analyses. In this paper three benchmark problems involving significant inelastic deformations will be discussed. One of the problems has been analyzed using many different finite element codes. The other two problems involve comparison of finite element calculations to the results form physical tests. The ability of the finite element method to accurately capture the response in these three problems indicates the method should be acceptable for <b>radioactive</b> material transportation <b>package</b> design and certification...|$|R

Within the quality checking of <b>radioactive</b> waste <b>packages</b> non-destructive assays are required to characterize their radiotoxic and chemotoxic contents. In a cooperation framework Forschungszentrum Jülich, RWTH Aachen University and the Siemens AG are studying the feasibility of a compact Neutron Imaging System for Radioactive waste Analysis (NISRA) using 14 MeV neutrons produced by a neutron generator. Fast neutron imaging is a promising technique to assay large and dense items providing in complementarity to photon imaging additional information {{on the presence of}} structures in <b>radioactive</b> waste <b>packages.</b> However due to the low neutron emission of neutron generators (10 ^ 8 to 10 ^ 10 n/s in 4 Pi) the challenging task resides in the development of an imaging detector (readout detector and neutron converter) with a high counting efficiency, a low sensitivity to gamma radiation and a resolution sufficient for the purpose. In this study two different readout detectors are studied. The first one is a large amorphous silicon flat panel and the second is a photomultiplier based detector with crossed wavelength shifting fibres. For both readout detectors the same type of neutron converter a simple plastic scintillator or a polypropylene resin mixed with ZnS as scintillation material is considered.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{hazardous}} and <b>radioactive</b> materials <b>packaging</b> is to, enable these materials {{to be transported}} without posing {{a threat to the}} health or property of the general public. To achieve this aim, regulations have been written establishing general design requirements for such packagings. While no regulations have been written specifically for mixed waste packaging, regulations for the constituents of mixed wastes, i. e., hazardous and radioactive substances, have been codified. The design requirements for both hazardous and <b>radioactive</b> materials <b>packaging</b> specify packaging compatibility, i. e., that the materials of the packaging and any contents be chemically compatible with each other. Furthermore, Type A and Type B packaging design requirements stipulate that there be no significant chemical, galvanic, or other reaction between the materials and contents of the package. Based on these requirements, a Chemical Compatibility Testing Program was developed in the Transportation Systems Department at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). The program, supported by the US Department of Energy`s (DOE) Transportation Management Division, EM- 261 provides the means to assure any regulatory body that the issue of packaging material compatibility towards hazardous and radioactive materials has been addressed. In this paper, we describe the general elements of the testing program and the experimental results of the screening tests. The implications of the results of this testing are discussed in the general context of packaging development. Additionally, we present the results of the first phase of this experimental program.
