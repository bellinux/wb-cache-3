25|$|In 1918, {{much of the}} Shire of Thuringowa's {{urban area}} was {{transferred}} to Townsville. This initially caused great hardship for the Shire, as its <b>rate</b> <b>base</b> {{had been reduced to}} 2,500 ratepayers and its council headquarters was outside the shire. The Council adopted a conservative approach to policy during this period that included not only the depression years of the 1930s but also during World War II, when the area became an important staging point and was host to significant numbers of military personnel.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Stewart {{signed with}} Time Publishing Ventures {{to develop a}} new magazine, Martha Stewart Living, for which Stewart would serve as editor-in-chief. The first issue was {{released}} in late 1990 with an initial <b>rate</b> <b>base</b> of 250,000. Circulation would peak in 2002 at more than 2 million copies per issue. In 1993, she began a weekly half-hour service program based on her magazine, which expanded to weekdays in 1997 and later to a full hour show in 1999, with half-hour episodes on weekends. Stewart also became a frequent contributor to NBC's Today Show and later to CBS's The Early Show, and starred in several prime time holiday specials on the CBS network.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{projected}} capital costs, {{and the low}} cost of fuel and in-service maintenance, in 1994 power from CANDU was predicted to be well under 5 cents/kWh. In 1998, Ontario Hydro calculated {{that the cost of}} generation from CANDU was 7.7 cents/kWh, whereas hydropower was only 1.1 cents, and their coal-fired plants were 4.3 cents. As Ontario Hydro received a regulated price averaging 6.3 cents/kWh for power in this period, the revenues from the other forms of generation were being used to fund the operating losses of the nuclear plants. The debt left over from the nuclear construction could not be included in the <b>rate</b> <b>base</b> until the reactors were declared in service, thereby exacerbating the total capital cost of construction with unpaid interest, at that time around $15 billion, and another $3.5 billion in debts throughout the system was held by a separate entity and repaid through a standing charge on electricity bills.|$|E

2500|$|During 2008–2009, Newsweek {{undertook}} a dramatic business restructuring. Citing difficulties in competing with online news sources to provide unique {{news in a}} weekly publication, the magazine refocused its content on opinion and commentary beginning with its May 24, 2009, issue. It shrank its subscriber <b>rate</b> <b>base,</b> from 3.1 million to 2.6 million in early 2008, to 1.9 million in July 2009 and then to 1.5 million in January 2010—a decline of 50% in one year. Meacham described his strategy as [...] "counterintuitive" [...] as it involved discouraging renewals and nearly doubling subscription prices as it sought a more affluent subscriber base for its advertisers. During this period, the magazine also laid off staff. While advertising revenues were down almost 50% compared to the prior year, expenses were also diminished, whereby the publishers hoped Newsweek would return to profitability.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were two}} phases in U.S. nuclear policy. [...] The first phase lasted from {{approximately}} 1954 to 1992. By {{the end of}} the 1980s, new plants were being built, and after 1992, there was a period of 13 years without any substantial nuclear legislation. [...] The United States was not the first nation to create a nuclear power plant. Both Russia and England managed to establish small, limited power plants before the U.S. [...] Although developments were taking place in the U.S. private sector before the 1954 act, it was not until mid-1956 that the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania came online. [...] This facility, which generated 50MW of power per year, and later up to 200MW, was the first full-scale nuclear power plant in the U.S. and the world. In the coming years, more and more plants were built by regulated utility companies, often state-based. These companies would [...] "put the capital cost into their <b>rate</b> <b>base</b> and amortize it against power sales. Their consumers bore the risk and paid the capital cost." ...|$|E
