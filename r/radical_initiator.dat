25|$|Initiation: The {{reaction}} is started by a free-radical source {{which may be}} a decomposing <b>radical</b> <b>initiator</b> such as AIBN.

2500|$|... where X is a halogen: {{fluorine}} (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), or iodine (I). This {{mechanism for}} {{this process is}} called free radical halogenation. It is initiated with UV light or some other <b>radical</b> <b>initiator.</b> A chlorine atom is generated from elemental chlorine, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from methane, resulting {{in the formation of}} hydrogen chloride. The resulting methyl radical, CH3•, can combine with another chlorine molecule to give methyl chloride (CH3Cl) and a chlorine atom. This chlorine atom can then react with another methane (or methyl chloride) molecule, repeating the chlorination cycle. Similar reactions can produce dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), chloroform (CHCl3), and, ultimately, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), depending upon reaction conditions and the chlorine to methane ratio.|$|E
50|$|In chemistry, <b>radical</b> <b>initiators</b> are {{substances}} {{that can produce}} radical species under mild conditions and promote radical reactions.

2500|$|In certain {{situations}} where strong electroosomotic flow toward the cathode is undesirable, the inner {{surface of the}} capillary can be coated with polymers, surfactants, or small molecules to reduce electroosmosis to very low levels, restoring the normal direction of migration (anions toward the anode, cations toward the cathode). [...] CE instrumentation typically includes power supplies with reversible polarity, allowing the same instrument {{to be used in}} [...] "normal" [...] mode (with EOF and detection near the cathodic end of the capillary) and [...] "reverse" [...] mode (with EOF suppressed or reversed, and detection near the anodic end of the capillary). [...] One of the most common approaches to suppressing EOF, reported by Stellan Hjertén in 1985, is to create a covalently attached layer of linear polyacrylamide. [...] The silica surface of the capillary is first modified with a silane reagent bearing a polymerizable vinyl group (e.g. 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane), followed by introduction of acrylamide monomer and a free <b>radical</b> <b>initiator.</b> [...] The acrylamide is polymerized in situ, forming long linear chains, some of which are covalently attached to the wall-bound silane reagent. [...] Numerous other strategies for covalent modification of capillary surfaces exist. [...] Dynamic or adsorbed coatings (which can include polymers or small molecules) are also common. [...] For example, in capillary sequencing of DNA, the sieving polymer (typically polydimethylacrylamide) suppresses electroosmotic flow to very low levels. [...] A variety of dynamic capillary coating agents are commercially available to modify, suppress, or reverse the direction of electroosmotic flow. [...] Besides modulating electroosmotic flow, capillary wall coatings can also serve the purpose of reducing interactions between [...] "sticky" [...] analytes (such as proteins) and the capillary wall. [...] Such wall-analyte interactions, if severe, manifest as reduced peak efficiency, asymmetric (tailing) peaks, or even complete loss of analyte to the capillary wall.|$|E
