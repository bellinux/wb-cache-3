40|$|The {{realization}} of phononic computing is {{held hostage by}} the lack of high performance thermal devices. Here we show through theoretical analysis and molecular dynamics simulations that unprecedented thermal <b>rectification</b> <b>factors</b> (as large as 1. 20) can be achieved utilizing the phase dependent thermal conductivity of polyethylene nanofibers. More importantly, such high thermal rectifications only need very small temperature differences (< 20 oC) across the device, which is a significant advantage over other thermal diodes which need temperature biases on the order of the operating temperature. Taking this into consideration, we show that the dimensionless temperature-scaled <b>rectification</b> <b>factors</b> of the polymer nanofiber diodes range from 12 to 25 - much larger than other thermal diodes (< 8). The polymer nanofiber thermal diode consists of a crystalline portion whose thermal conductivity is highly phase-sensitive and a cross-linked portion which has a stable phase. Nanoscale size effect can be utilized to tune the phase transition temperature of the crystalline portion, enabling thermal diodes capable of operating at different temperatures.

40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. With the increasing need for source and load isolation for safer operation, higher power density (compact size), and higher power factor requirement in the modem computer power supplies and military applications, the power converter designers have to opt for high frequency switching power supplies. Most of the above-mentioned requirements have so far been satisfied by using the conventional Switch Mode Rectifier. However, these structures still exhibit some significant disadvantages. The primary disadvantages of the conventional approach are: it requires relatively large input ac filter components, requires two stages of rectification and of de filtering (i. e., at the front-end and output rectifiers), and exhibit poor overall input power factor and current total harmonic distortion. Moreover, the input line current drawn by the front-end bridge rectifier is non sinusoidal, which can create a number of problems through the power distribution network. Combined with the increased interest in smaller size personal computers, as well as the introduction of stricter harmonic regulation, the existing approach need to be refined to yield higher power density and better input harmonic content. This thesis focuses on new topology for series resonant ac-to-dc rectifier with high frequency isolation. The proposed approach employs a PWM controlled ac controller, a series resonant tank and a high-frequency isolation transformer. With this approach, the single phase input ac is directly processed via the ac-to-ac converter eliminating the acto-dc <b>rectification</b> stage, power <b>factor</b> correction boost stage, and dc-dc converter stage present in the conventional system. The output of the high-frequency isolation transformer is rectified and processed via a filtering stage to obtain a dc output.

40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 56 - 57). Power electronics {{is a means of}} controlling/processing in an appropriate way that is suitable for the load. Power conditioning is done to ensure higher efficiency and power density. Improved efficiency can reduce emission of heat/wasted power so that it can reduces environmental pollution. Power electronic converters use semi-conductor switching devices that are operated in ON-OFF states. These converters have higher efficiency with the control of distorted input signals. The input signal distortion increases with the increased use of these converters. Various standards have been set to limit the level of distortion. One of the ways of measuring these distortions is THD. A signal having THD more than the specified range has some detrimental effect on the line to which it is connected. Lighting loads are one of the major powering applications. Approximately 19 % to 20 % of the power is used for this purpose. As a result high efficient lighting system is a major research area in power electronics. In this regard incandescent bulbs were replaced by discharge lights (those are operated in negative resistance region) long ago. A ballast circuit is included to limit the current flow in this circuit. Initially magnetic ballasts were used. However due to some disadvantages like flickering, size, high cost, low efficiency etc electronic ballast has taken place instead of magnetic ballast. The focus of this thesis is in the electronic ballasts in discharge lamps and the total harmonic distortion produced due to the non-linear circuit situated in the lamps. The main objective is to minimize this distortion as far as possible. Various simulations have been done in order to measure the total harmonic distortion of ballast circuit situated on the CFL bulb. Moreover a power <b>factor</b> <b>rectification</b> circuit has been provided to improve the power factor and reduce the THD value of the ballast circuit.

40|$|Semi bridge {{converters}} {{are formed}} by the removal of upper (or alternatively, lower) phase leg semiconductor switching devices of their full bridge counterparts. They offer substantial advantages over a complete full bridge arrangement, because of their reduced controlled switch count and shoot through free phase leg structure. However, {{in contrast to the}} bidirectional capability of a full bridge converter, a semi bridge structure can only transfer energy in one specific direction, which limits its use to unity power <b>factor</b> <b>rectification</b> only, and even then with an identifiable level of degradation of its input current harmonic performance. The first objective of this thesis is to quantify the impact that the intrinsic topological constraint of a semi bridge rectifier has on its input current quality. A detailed analytical expression is developed for the input current under this restriction, incorporating second order effects such as supply voltage harmonics and semiconductor voltage drops. The result is used to identify the theoretical input current total harmonic distortion limits for the semi bridge rectifier as converter parameters and working conditions are varied. The second objective is to mitigate the intrinsic limitation of semi bridge rectifiers using multilevel arrangements, because of their ability to reduce the filter inductance for a given operating switching frequency. For a semi bridge rectifier, the input current harmonic performance is directly proportional to the size of filter inductance, so that the smaller filter size allowed by a multilevel converter reduces the inherent low frequency input current distortion. Two novel multilevel semi bridge rectifier structures, and the specific pulse width modulation technique for the correct carrier harmonics cancelling in these topologies, are devised and extensively validated. Finally, the third objective is to broaden the application of semi bridge converters to operate at any power factor. Recent work presents an alternative multilevel approach via the inclusion of a coupled inductor into the converter phase leg, between the upper and lower switching devices. This concept, initially conceived for the H bridge topology, was later extended to the diode clamped converter architecture. In the first instance, both these coupled inductor arrangements appear to be new inverter structures. However, more detailed analysis identifies that they are in fact the parallel connection of two complementary semi bridge converter phase legs. Although the two individual semi bridge phase legs offer unidirectional power flow only, when operating within this topological arrangement, this intrinsic limitation is overcome and the converter output offers bidirectional regenerative capability. This recognition led to a number of benefits. Firstly, a third family member is readily derived, based on a flying capacitor multilevel structure. Secondly, it becomes straightforward to identify how to best modulate and control this family of topologically reduced converters, since there is a wealth of established knowledge about how to best control their full bridge counterparts. Finally, at least for the IGBT based variants, the identification of their common semi bridge origin allows additional unnecessary diodes to be removed from the reduced topologies, minimizing their silicon device count to exactly match their full bridge counterparts. All theoretical analyses presented in this thesis were broadly confirmed by precisely matched switched simulations and experiments performed on a set of laboratory prototypes...|$|R

PEC cell measurements reveal that the ED-ZnTe films have both n- and p-type electrical conductivity. Using the n- and p-type ZnTe layers, a p-n homo-junction diode with device structure of glass/FTO/n-ZnTe/p-ZnTe/Au was fabricated. The fabricated diode showed <b>rectification</b> <b>factor</b> of 102, ideality factor of 2. 58 and threshold voltage of ~ 0. 25 V...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with heat flow asymmetry through composites of water and aqueous solutions. Central to this exploration are the behaviour of heat transfer {{in the vicinity of}} the density maximum and the behaviour of the temperature of maximum density of aqueous solutions. Both of these topics are investigated by cooling a rectangular enclosure of the test fluid in a quasi-steady state manner. During cooling, the temperature at select points within the liquid is monitored and the flow of heat at both isothermal walls is measured. As the liquid cools through its density maximum the normal single-cell convection that occurs in the presence of a horizontal temperature gradient changes to a double cell configuration {{in the vicinity of the}} density maximum. This transition manifests itself in changes in the horizontal temperature profile across the cavity and in the rate of cooling of the fluid. A measurement technique to study the behaviour of the temperature of maximum density of aqueous solutions is described in this thesis that relies on these changes. These changes are investigated experimentally and numerically. The study of the behaviour of heat transfer and the temperature of maximum density of aqueous solutions revealed that heat transfer is reduced in the vicinity of the density maximum and that the temperature of maximum density of aqueous solutions depends on the nature and concentration of the solute. Both of these results are exploited in the study of heat flow asymmetry through a device that consists of two cubic enclosures side by side; one enclosure contains water with a density maximum at 4 oC and the other enclosure contains a saline solution with a density maximum at 2 oC. A temperature gradient, which spans both of these temperatures of maximum density, is applied horizontally across the composite system, resulting in different rates of heat transfer through the device depending on the gradient direction. Experiments performed with a 12 cm x 6 cm x 6 cm container yield heat transfer rates of 0. 55 W and 0. 19 W depending on the direction of the temperature gradient, resulting in a <b>rectification</b> <b>factor</b> of 65. 4 %. Asymmetrical heat transfer rates are also found in composite systems of water and solids when the temperature gradient spans the temperature of maximum density of the water. Results from computational fluid dynamics confirm the experimental results, and are used to investigate the influence of such parameters as temperature gradient and container aspect ratio on the <b>rectification</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional heterostructures offer a new {{route to}} {{manipulate}} phonons at the nanoscale. By performing non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations we address the thermal transport properties of structurally asymmetric graphene/hBN nanoribbon heterojunctions deposited on several substrates: graphite, Si(100), SiC(0001), and SiO 2. Our results show {{a reduction of}} the interface thermal resistance in coplanar G/hBN heterojunctions upon substrate deposition which is mainly related to the increment on the power spectrum overlap. This effect is more pronounced for deposition on Si(100) and SiO 2 substrates, independently of the planar stacking order of the materials. Moreover, {{it has been found}} that the thermal <b>rectification</b> <b>factor</b> increases {{as a function of the}} degree of structural asymmetry for hBN-G nanoribbons, reaching values up to similar to 24 %, while it displays a minimum (is an element of[0. 7, 2. 4]) for G-hBN nanoribbons. More importantly, these properties can also be tuned by varying the substrate temperature, e. g., thermal rectification of symmetric hBN-G nanoribbon is enhanced from 8. 8 % to 79 % by reducing the temperature of Si(100) substrate. Our investigation yields new insights into the physical mechanisms governing heat transport in G/hBN heterojunctions, and thus opens potential new routes to the design of phononic devices.

40|$|ZnSe {{thin films}} of both p and n {{conducting}} types were successfully deposited on transparent conducting glass substrates using an electrochemical deposition technique. Thin films were deposited from an aqueous acidic electrolyte containing ZnSO 4 and H 2 SeO 3. Deposition of thin films in a voltage range of 0. 0 to - 1. 0 V was investigated {{by means of}} a voltamogram. The most suitable deposition voltage range was found to be - 0. 48 to - 0. 62 V for ZnSe in this aqueous medium. The nature of the surface of the conducting glass and the deposited ZnSe layers were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Although the substrate surface was rough and spiky as observed from the AFM studies, electrodeposited ZnSe layers exhibit good crystallinity when compared to MBE grown ZnSe layers on GaAs (1 0 0) surfaces. The C-V depth profiling studies suggest the level of charge carrier concentration to be in the semiconducting region for these thin film materials. Photoluminescence studies were carried out in order to study the energy states in the band gap region and the results indicate the presence of less number of defect levels in comparison with MBE grown ZnSe layers. The best p-n junction devices fabricated with electrodeposited layers to date display a <b>rectification</b> <b>factor</b> of over five orders of magnitude at 1. 0 V.

Based on former work in which 10 % conversion efficiency was reported, optimisation {{has been made to}} the semiconductor layers, precursors, thicknesses and the post-growth treatment. These results demonstrate the advantages of multi-layer graded bandgap device configuration and the inclusion of gallium based post-growth treatment (CdCl 2 +Ga 2 (SO 4) 3) on the CdS/CdTe-based device structure. The fabricated devices were characterised using both current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) techniques. Under dark I-V condition, a <b>rectification</b> <b>factor</b> (R. F.) of 104. 8, ideality factor (n) of 1. 60 and a barrier height (ϕb) > 0. 82 eV were observed. Under AM 1. 5 illuminated I-V condition, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 34. 08 mAcm- 2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 730 mV, fill-factor (FF) of 0. 57 and conversion efficiency of 14. 18 % were observed. Under dark C-V condition, doping density (ND) of 7. 79 × 1014 cm- 3 and a depletion width (W) of 1092 nm were achieved.

40|$|Existing {{inorganic}} {{materials for}} radiation sensors suffer from several drawbacks, including {{their inability to}} cover large curved areas, lack of tissue equivalence toxicity, and mechanical inflexibility. As an alternative to inorganics, poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) diodes have been evaluated for their suitability for detecting radiation via the direct creation of X-ray induced photocurrents. A single layer of PTAA is deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, with top electrodes selected from Al, Au, Ni, and Pd. The choice of metal electrode has a pronounced effect {{on the performance of}} the device; there is a direct correlation between the diode <b>rectification</b> <b>factor</b> and the metal-PTAA barrier height. A diode with an Al contact shows the highest quality of rectifying junction, and it produces a high X-ray photocurrent (several nA) that is stable during continuous exposure to 50 kV Mo K alpha X-radiation over long time scales, combined with a high signal-to-noise ratio with fast response times of less than 0. 25 s. Diodes with a low band gap, 'Ohmic' contact, such as ITO/PTAA/Au, show a slow transient response. This result {{can be explained by the}} build-up of space charge at the metal-PTAA interface, caused by a high level of charge injection due to X-ray-induced carriers. These data provide new insights into the optimum selection of metals for Schottky contacts on organic materials, with wider applications in light sensors and photovoltaic devices...|$|E
