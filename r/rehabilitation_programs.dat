5|$|But I'm a Cheerleader was Babbit's {{first feature}} film. It was {{inspired}} by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs.</b> She used {{the story of a}} young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the social construction of gender roles and heteronormativity. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.|$|E
5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs</b> increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E
5|$|Counseling {{about sex}} and {{sexuality}} by medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part of}} most SCI <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs.</b> Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are psychotherapy, peer mentorship, and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{fast-track}} <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> and conventional care for patients after resection of colorectal cancer. METHODS: One hundred and six consecutive patients who underwent fast-track <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> {{were encouraged to}} have early oral feeding and movement for early discharge, while 104 consecutive patients underwent conventional care after resection of colorectal cancer. Their gastrointestinal functions, postoperative complications and hospital stay time were recorded. RESULTS: The restoration time of gastrointestinal functions in the patients was significantly faster after fast-track <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> than after conventional care (2. 1 d vs 3. 2 d, P < 0. 01). The percentage of patients who developed complications was significantly lower 30 d after fast-track <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> than after conventional care (13. 2 % vs 26. 9 %, P < 0. 05). Also, the percentage of patients who had general complications was significantly lower 30 d after fast-track <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> than after conventional care (6. 6 % vs 15. 4 %, P < 0. 05). The postoperative hospital stay time of the patients was shorter after fast-track <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> than after conventional care (5 d vs 7 d, P < 0. 01). No significant difference was observed in the re-admission rate 30 d after fast-track <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> and conventional care (3. 8 % vs 8. 7 %). CONCLUSION: The fast-track <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> can significantly decrease the complications and shorten the time of postoperative hospital stay of patients after resection colorectal cancer...|$|R

5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs</b> is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E
5|$|Non-surgical {{treatment}} is rarely an option {{as the ability}} for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, stem cell transplantation, and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of immobilization and physical therapy. Most <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs</b> combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the immobilization period, isometric exercises, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundEven after a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program,</b> {{levels of}} {{physical}} activity in COPD progressively decrease unless strategies to encourage activity are implemented. We analyzed {{the effects of the}} implementation of urban walking circuits on levels {{of physical activity}} and exercise capacity of patients with severe and very severe COPD after a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program.</b> MethodA total of 83 patients were randomized to either urban circuits group (UCG) or usual care in the non-circuit group (NCG), after completing a 2 -week <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program.</b> Results were evaluated 9 months after completion of the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program</b> and were compared with a control group of 54 patients not enrolled in the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program.</b> ResultsAt the end of follow-up, UCG patients increased their physical activity by a mean of 32. 4 (SE =  5. 9) min per day and 1. 09 (SE =  0. 22) days walked per week; 33. 9 (SE =  5. 6) min per day and 1. 12 (SE =  0. 24) days per week more compared to the NCG (p    0. 05). Controls showed a significant decrease in exercise capacity and physical activity over the follow-up. ConclusionsUrban circuits are an easy, inexpensive strategy, which demonstrated to be useful to stimulate physical activity in our population of severe and very severe COPD patients and resulted in increased exercise capacity even 9 months after completion of a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>program.</b> ClinicalTrials. gov, Identifier NCT 01854008...|$|R

25|$|Organized {{sport for}} persons with {{physical}} disabilities developed out of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs.</b> Following World War II, {{in response to the}} needs of large numbers of injured ex-service members and civilians, sport was introduced as a key part of rehabilitation. Sport for rehabilitation grew into recreational sport and then into competitive sport. The pioneer of this approach was Ludwig Guttmann of the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in England. In 1948, while the Olympic Games were being held in London, England, he organized a sports competition for wheelchair athletes at Stoke Mandeville. This was the origin of the Stoke Mandeville Games, which evolved into the modern Paralympic Games.|$|E
25|$|A psychoactive drug, psychopharmaceutical, or psychotropic is a {{chemical}} substance that changes brain function {{and results in}} alterations in perception, mood, consciousness or behavior. These substances may be used medically; recreationally; to purposefully improve performance or alter one's consciousness; as entheogens; for ritual, spiritual, or shamanic purposes; or for research. Some categories of psychoactive drugs, which have therapeutic value, are prescribed by physicians and other healthcare practitioners. Examples include anesthetics, analgesics, anticonvulsant and antiparkinsonian drugs as well as medications used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders, such as antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and stimulant medications. Some psychoactive substances {{may be used in}} the detoxification and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs</b> for persons dependent on or addicted to other psychoactive drugs.|$|E

25|$|Psychological {{dependency}} {{is addressed}} in many drug <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs</b> {{by attempting to}} teach the patient new methods of interacting in a drug-free environment. In particular, patients are generally encouraged, or possibly even required, to not associate with friends who still use the addictive substance. Twelve-step programs encourage addicts not only to stop using alcohol or other drugs, but to examine and change habits related to their addictions. Many programs emphasize that recovery is a permanent process without culmination. For legal drugs such as alcohol, complete abstention—rather than attempts at moderation, which may lead to relapse—is also emphasized ("One is too many, and a thousand is never enough.") Whether moderation is achievable by those {{with a history of}} abuse remains a controversial point, but is generally considered unsustainable.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{physical}} exercise {{with or without}} physiotherapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for patients experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking {{have been found to}} decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, diaphragmatic breathing, and meditation techniques. Common changes in gait associated with the disease such as hypokinesia (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing are addressed by a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Goals with respect to gait during <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>programs</b> include improving gait speed, base of support, stride length, trunk and arm swing movement. Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and auditory), exercises (marching and PNF patterns) and varying environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed).|$|E
