25|$|These {{core drill}} bits {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to <b>reamers</b> as they have no cutting point or means of starting a hole. They have 3 or 4 flutes which enhances the finish of the hole and ensures the bit cuts evenly. Core drill bits differ from <b>reamers</b> {{in the amount of}} material they are intended to remove. A reamer is only intended to enlarge a hole a slight amount which, depending on the <b>reamers</b> size, may be anything from 0.1 millimeter to perhaps a millimeter. A core drill bit may be used to double the size of a hole.|$|E

2500|$|Robert LeMeur had a spoon-shaped icebreaking bow {{designed}} to minimize ice resistance, a {{further development of}} Canmar Kigoriaks hull form. The bow was also fitted with <b>reamers</b> that made it about [...] wider than the vertical-sided midbody, breaking a wider channel that would help with turning in difficult ice conditions. The deckhouse was mounted forward of a [...] open cargo deck and nine bulk cargo silos. The superstructure design was chosen to minimize vibrations and maximize visibility from the one-man primary conning position. She had accommodation for 14 crew members and 12 supernumeraries. Under the main deck, Robert LeMeur had a full-length double hull as per Canmar policy.|$|E
50|$|To achieve highly {{accurate}} and consistent diameters with a <b>reamer,</b> one must consider process variables that {{can influence the}} overall quality of the hole being reamed. Variables such as <b>reamer</b> material, <b>reamer</b> design, material being reamed, temperature at the reamed surface, <b>reamer</b> speed, machine or operator movement, etc. must be addressed. By controlling these variables to the best extent possible, the reaming process can easily produce highly {{accurate and}} consistently sized holes.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Intramedullary nailing is {{a common}} {{technique}} used to treat long bone fractures, however there is ongoing debate as {{to the use of}} reaming in these procedures. In this case, intramedullary nailing was undertaken; however, there was an intraoperative failure of the <b>reamer</b> causing the <b>reamer</b> to fracture. While there are several well-documented risk factors associated with reaming, equipment failure is not commonly reported. Case Summary: An 18 -year-old male presented with a 2 year history of a right tibial stress fracture and pain with weight bearing. He elected to have an intramedullary nail placed with intraoperative reaming to stabilize the fracture and encourage healing. During the procedure the <b>reamer</b> fractured, and while the nail placement was ultimately successful the patient retained a small fragment of the fractured <b>reamer</b> within his tibia. Discussion: There are documented risk factors associated with intramedullary reaming, most notably with regard to the thermal effects on the bone during reaming and intramedullary pressure changes related to embolization, but <b>reamer</b> failure is not a commonly reported complication. While {{it has been shown that}} <b>reamer</b> failure has occurred in other cases, there is a lack of a standard quality assurance process to adequately assess the quality of the equipment prior to the procedure. <b>Reamer</b> damage of varying degree has been identified at other hospitals and attributed to wear produced during the reaming process, leading to increased strain on the <b>reamer</b> intraoperatively. The association of <b>reamer</b> dullness, fatigue failure, manufacturing/metallurgy defect, and monitoring cycles of use on complete <b>reamer</b> failure should be better characterized in order to create quality assurance standards. Conclusions: <b>Reamer</b> failure is a rare complication of intramedullary nailing. In addition, there is a lack of clear recommendations as to how to manage patients that have a retained foreign body from intraoperative <b>reamer</b> failure. While clinical management of these patients will depend on the individual case, development of a clear quality assurance procedure for reusable surgical equipment could avoid negative outcomes resulting from intraoperative <b>reamer</b> fractures...|$|R
50|$|A hand <b>reamer</b> has {{a longer}} taper or lead {{in at the}} front than a machine <b>reamer.</b> This is to {{compensate}} for the difficulty of starting a hole by hand power alone. It also allows the <b>reamer</b> to start straight and reduce the risk of breakage. The flutes may be straight or spiral.|$|R

50|$|Chamber <b>reamers</b> come in {{two general}} types - solid pilot <b>reamers</b> and {{floating}} pilot <b>reamers.</b> A solid pilot reamer has, as the name suggests, a solid steel pilot on the end to guide the reamer through the bore of the barrel. These <b>reamers</b> are generally more durable and less expensive than floating pilot <b>reamers.</b> Floating pilot <b>reamers</b> use interchangeable pilots that are positioned {{at the front of}} the reamer. The primary advantage of a floating pilot reamer is that it is self-centering and can be fitted with a pilot that is an exact match with the barrel it is passing though. Barrels tend to vary in diameter by minute amounts, and this variation can create a situation whereby the solid pilot reamer fits too loosely or too snugly in the bore. Another advantage of floating pilot <b>reamers</b> is that the pilot itself does not spin with the reamer, and therefore is less likely to damage the bore. The primary disadvantage of the floating point reamer is that the nose of the reamer must be cut down in diameter to accommodate the reamer pilot, resulting in a more delicate reamer.|$|E

50|$|Taper pin <b>reamers</b> are {{designed}} to prepare the hole for taper pins. Metric taper <b>reamers</b> are designated by the small diameter. For example, a 2 mm taper pin reamer has a 1.9 mm small end (2 mm nominal size) and a 2.86 mm large end.|$|E
5000|$|Chamber <b>reamers</b> are {{typically}} made of {{high speed steel}} and require lubrication during the cutting operation.

50|$|The final {{hole size}} that is {{achieved}} by a <b>reamer</b> subsequently depends on the reaming process being {{used in conjunction with}} the <b>reamer</b> design and materials involved. Studies have been conducted which demonstrate the effect of coolant use during reaming. The continuous use of a coolant stream during the reaming process has been shown to consistently (75% of the time) result in hole sizes that are 0.0001 in. (0.0025 mm) larger than the <b>reamer</b> itself, with a process spread of +/- 0.0002 in. the remainder of the time. Similarly, using a semi-wet reaming process often results in hole sizes that are 0.0004 in. larger than the <b>reamer</b> itself, approximately 60% of the time, with a process spread of 0.0006 in. favoring an increase in size.

40|$|Fluoroscopy-based {{navigation}} {{systems can}} be used for internal fixation of intracapsular femoral neck fractures, with the object of optimizing positioning of the implant and reducing radiation exposure. With this technique, the virtual position and direction of a <b>reamer</b> can be simultaneously superimposed on anteroposterior (AP) and axial (AX) fluoroscopic images. However, surgeons have to rely on the accuracy of these systems, because the only intraoperative feedback on the true position of the <b>reamer</b> is the projection of a virtual <b>reamer</b> superimposed on two fluoroscopic images. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the accuracy of the displayed position of the virtual <b>reamer</b> in relation to the true position of the instrument when using a fluoroscopy-based navigation system (medivision, Oberdorf, Switzerland). Secondary to this, the accuracy of the drill-channel measuring tool of the system was analyzed. The study was performed on 20 sawbones. To evaluate the position of the virtual <b>reamer,</b> an 8 -mm Perspex bar was inserted in predefined drill channels in each sawbone. AP and AX fluoroscopic images of the sawbones with the Perspex bar were loaded into the workstation. The Perspex bar was then removed and exchanged for a navigated dynamic hip screw (DHS) <b>reamer.</b> The position of the Perspex bar in the images represented the true position of the <b>reamer.</b> Subsequently, the difference between the position of the virtual <b>reamer</b> and the Perspex bar was measured with a dedicated computer program. Drill-channel lengths measured with the system were compared with measurements obtained with a digital ruler. The mean difference in position of the Perspex bar and <b>reamer</b> at a predefined point was 0. 90 mm (range: 0. 00 - 3. 21 mm) in 360 images. The mean difference in length measurements between the medivision system and the digital ruler was 1. 00 mm (p = 0. 01, SD = 1. 33).
