Significant persons developing functional chemicals in Hercules could be mentioned: Dr. Keim on his efforts developing PAE wet strength resin, Mr Kai Kiviö on his efforts on developing cationic <b>rosin</b> <b>size.</b> Basis of AKD -technology Hercules acquired more or less voluntary from German BASF after the Second World War.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of the mass {{production}} of paper, the type of size used for paper production also changed. As Swartzburg writes, “By 1850 <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> had come into use. Unfortunately, it produces a chemical action that hastens the decomposition of even the finest papers.” [...] In the field of library preservation it is known “that acid hydrolysis of cellulose and related carbo-hydrates sic {{is one of the key}} factors responsible for the degradation of paper during ageing.” [...] Some recent professional work has focused on the specific in the degradation involved in the deterioration of paper that has had a rosin sizing process, and what amount of rosin affects the deterioration process, in addition to work on developing permanent paper and sizing agents that will not eventually destroy the paper. An issue on the periphery to the preservation of paper and sizing, is washing, which is described by V. Daniels and J. Kosek as, “The removal of discolouration ... in water is principally effected by the dissolution of water-soluble material; this is usually done by immersing paper in water.” In such a process, surface level items applied to the paper, such as size in early paper making processes as seen above, have the possibility of being removed from the paper, which might have some item specific interest in a special collections library. With later processes in paper making being more akin to “engine sizing,” as H. Hardman and E. J. Cole describe it, “Engine sizing, which is part of the manufacturing process, has the ingredients added to the furnish or stock prior to sheet formation,” [...] the concern for the removal of size is less, and as such, most literature focuses on the more pressing issue of preserving acidic papers and similar issues.|$|E
40|$|A <b>rosin</b> <b>sizing</b> agent {{designed}} to impregnate wood and immobilize copper in wood cells for protection against decay was investigated. Poplar (Populus ussuriensis) wood was impregnated with combinations of 3 % CuSO 4 solution and 1. 0 %, 2. 0 %, or 4. 0 % <b>rosin</b> <b>sizing</b> agent. The decay resistance of treated wood blocks {{was measured by}} a soil-block culture method. After a 12 -week decay test, the weight losses of untreated control blocks were 70. 45 % by Trametes versicolor and 61. 84 % by Gloeophyllum trabeum. The wood decay resistance was also slightly improved by the treatment with only the <b>rosin</b> <b>sizing</b> agent. However, after being treated with the <b>rosin</b> <b>sizing</b> agent and CuSO 4, the wood had great decay resistance. The average weight losses of the samples degraded by fungi were less than 4 %. Notably, the leached wood blocks had a weight loss of less than 3 %. After leaching, the copper content in the leachates was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Results showed {{that the amount of}} copper ions released from the samples treated with the copper-rosin solutions was half those from the samples treated with copper alone. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX) proved that the copper element was still in the cell lumens of leached wood blocks, which is consistent with the results of AAS analysis. This signifies that the <b>rosin</b> <b>sizing</b> agent is very helpful to fix the copper preservative in wood...|$|R

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> retention in rosin soap size-alum systems was studied {{on the basis}} of sizing behavior and the <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> and aluminum contents of handsheets prepared under normal and particular conditions. <b>Rosin</b> <b>size,</b> aluminum, and calcium contents of handsheets prepared with various stirring times of pulp suspensions after pH adjustment suggested that <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> components adsorbed on pulp fibers predominantly have the structure of free rosin acid rather than rosin aluminum or calcium salt. When a carboxyl group-blocked pulp was used, the <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> content clearly decreased. This result shows that pulp carboxyl groups {{play a significant role in}} <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> retention. Electrostatic interactions between dissociated carboxyl groups of pulps and anionic <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> components through cationic aluminum compounds must be present in pulp suspensions. On the other hand, nonionic interactions in pulp suspensions, which occur particularly around pH 6.2 – 6.5, may also contribute to <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> retention and appearance of sizing features. When the carboxyl group blocked pulp was used, some <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> components were retained in the handsheets in largely coagulated form, resulting in no or quite low sizing levels, when the handsheets were dried at 20 °C.|$|E
30|$|Four rosin derivatives, {{including}} {{rosin esters}} and rosinamides, were synthesized {{and used to}} prepare neutral rosin sizes. Their effects during sizing are discussed in detail. Compared to natural rosin, the rosin derivatives had nearly no effect on sizing even at high retention levels in paper. However, the rosin derivatives in the rosin sizes improved {{the stability of the}} emulsion size particles, and there was good correlation between the sizing effect and the stability of the emulsion sizes under neutral to alkaline conditions. On the other hand, the structure of the rosin derivatives significantly influenced the stability and sizing effect of the neutral rosin sizes. In particular, for glycerin rosin ester-rosin sizes, the emulsion stability and sizing effect increased with an increasing proportion of dirosinate, among the glycerin rosin esters. Consequently, it was suggested that the rosin derivatives hardly contribute to the sizing performance of paper but predominantly function to stabilize the neutral <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> particles, thereby improving the efficiency of the size under neutral to alkaline sizing conditions. Also it was supposed that glycerol dirosinate in the neutral <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> would probably enable formation of a more stable particle structure to prevent the destructive action of the OH− ion.|$|E
30|$|Handsheets were {{prepared}} with rosin soap size and aluminum sulfate under various conditions, and the retention {{behavior of the}} <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> and aluminum components in the handsheets was studied. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography and X-ray fluorescence analysis {{were used to determine}} the size and aluminum contents in the handsheets, respectively. When the addition level of rosin soap size varied from 0 % to 4 % and that of aluminum sulfate was fixed at 2 %, the <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> content increased with the increase in the size addition level, whereas aluminum and calcium contents were roughly constant. Under these conditions, handsheets prepared from fines-free pulp had aluminum contents less than those for the original beaten pulp, probably because the former pulp had a carboxyl content less than that of the latter pulp. Not only the conventional rosin retention mechanism but also mechanism proposed below must exist in the rosin soap size-alum systems. That is, some aluminum compounds originating from aluminum sulfate are adsorbed on pulp fibers immediately after the aluminum sulfate addition. These adsorbed aluminum compounds form cationic sites on pulp fibers, and free rosin acid components with anionic charges are then adsorbed onto the cationic sites of pulp fibers at the wet-end.|$|E

40|$|Effects {{of the new}} <b>rosin</b> <b>sizing</b> method with a rosin emulsion, alum and polyvinylamine (PV Am) on the {{properties}} of the sized papers were investigated in terms of basis weight, sizing degree, pH value, brightness and folding endurance of the papers. The MIT folding endurances of the sized papers were much larger than that of the control paper due to the use of PV Am in the sizing. The pH values of papers Nos. 1 to 5 sized at pHs 5 to 8 were in acidic region varying from pH 5. 5 to 5. 8, and the papers lost dramatically their brigthnesses and folding endurances. The pH values of papers Nos. 6 to 10 containing different amounts of CaCO_ 3, varied from pH 7. 9 to 8. 3, and the papers retained their permanence well during the accelerated aging. These results illustrate that although the new sizing method was effective under neutral-alkaline papermaking conditions, the sized papers were acidic and exhibited poor permanence.

40|$|Edge wicking, i. e. {{in-plane}} wetting, is {{an important}} parameter for liquid packaging board products. Before filling of the products at the dairy the web is being sterilised with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). A tube is shaped and cut into packages which mean that new surfaces are created. If a short stop occurs in the sterilising bath the raw edges exposed to H 2 O 2 could absorb the liquid and when the package later is being filled this absorption could lead to tube burst. For the end products {{it is also important}} to prevent the liquid from penetrating the raw edges of the board in order to maintain the functionality and fresh look of the package. To control edge wicking different kinds of internal hydrophobic sizing agents are used. Alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) is the most common size in neutral sizing and rosin in conjunction with alum is the traditional acidic sizing agent. AKD and <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> are often used in combination (dual sizing) to make the board hydrophobic. The objective of this work was to examine the effects of the sizing agents on different pulps in different dosages. The pulps used in the sheet preparation were unbleached kraft pulp as well as bleached and unbleached CTMP refined to different levels. Apart from varying the size dosages, the wet sheets were also pressed at different levels to vary the density. The major part of the study included dual sizing but a minor part also concerned mono sized sheets. The parameters investigated on the laboratory sheets were STFI-Density, hydrogen peroxide edge wicking, pressurised edge wicking, lactic acid edge wicking (LA) and AKD and <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> content. In hydrogen peroxide edge wicking the amount of size was the central source of improved wick index. The retention was therefore of great significance for the results. The dual sized sheets were found to give least edge wicking, due to the synergy effect between AKD and alum <b>rosin</b> <b>size.</b> The kraft pulps gave sheets with satisfactory edge wicking even at the lowest size dosage (1 kg/t) while CTMP required a dosage of 4 kg/t to reach the same wick index. To achieve acceptable pressurised edge wicking values the most important parameter was found to be the density of the sheets. The kraft pulp sheets gave the lowest edge penetration while the high freeness CTMP sheets did not give satisfactory penetration resistant even at the highest size dosage. The edge wicking of lactic acid could be prevented by sizing with AKD only. Sheets made from mono sized sheets containing <b>rosin</b> <b>size</b> did not manage to avoid a large in-plane wetting of the board structure. Hence, dual sizing to improve the edge wicking of lactic acid is not necessary. The density was found not to be an important parameter in lactic acid edge wicking, all the pulps got equal edge wicking regardless of density. Retention above 1 kg/t AKD in sheets was enough to prevent penetration. Retention above 1. 5 kg/t AKD in sheet did not improve the edge wicking any further. No significant difference in sizeability between unbleached and bleached CTMP was observed...|$|E

A study has been made on the mechanism of <b>rosin</b> <b>sizing</b> in papermaking. By using microelectrophoresis and laboratory prepared handsheets, {{a study of the}} effect of pH, certain metal salts, and various physical parameters on the overall electrokinetics and sizing efficiency of the system has been made. By the use of a novel sizing method it was possible to effectively size handsheets in the alkaline pH range, which had previously not been possible when using <b>rosin</b> dispersion <b>sizes.</b> This permitted the inclusion of calcium carbonate as a filler, which has particular advantages in the finished paper. Use of the theory proposed by Derjaguin-LandauVerwey and Overbeek on colloidal interaction, made it possible to explain and predict the likely outcome of sizing experiments, by analysing the electrokinetics of the system components. A comparative study on the effect of rosin fortification and the stabilisation of the dispersions by the use of casein has been made From the results obtained, fortification leads to an improvement in sizing, particularly if the drying of the paper is not very efficient. Whereas the interactions of casein primarily effect the stabilisation of the dispersion, protein desorption from the solid-liquid interface causes initial flocculation of the dispersion. If the desorption is kept to a minimum, the dispersion is still stable and an effective sizing agent...|$|R

Results showed that identification of the Diels-Alder adduct of abietic acid and maleic anhydride using Mass spectrometry produced a mixture of endo-maleopimaric acid methyl ester with endo-maleopimaric acid tri methyl ester, as indicated by a fragment ion at m/z = 146 with a molecular weight of 414 and fragment ions at m/z = 121, 187, 316 and 386, denoting an endo-maleopimaric acid methyl ester. A fragment ion at m/z = 146 with a molecular weight of 460 and other fragment ions at m/z = 187, 121, 400 and 428 indicated endo-maleopimaric tri methyl ester. Using a large amount of rosin as a raw material to produce MPA, the equation Y = - 0. 8475 X 2 + 10. 448 X - 9. 7125, at a reaction temperature of 200 °C is still relevant as it denoted that a molar ratio of 1 : 6. 2 (rosin and MA) is the best.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 First, a {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis was}} carried out upon a sizing-desizing process. The energetic analysis shows that <b>rosin</b> soap <b>size</b> should be bound to fibers through primary chemical forces such as covalent bonds to effect sizing. Secondary chemical forces are all thermodynamically unstable to the attack of water molecules. It is also shown that the stronger the bonding between size and fibers is, the higher the degree of sizing of paper can be. Then ferric and ferrous ions were investigated as mordants for <b>rosin</b> soap <b>size.</b> While ferric ion at pH 3. 0 to 4. 0 and ferrous ion at pH around 5. 5 are able to induce {{a very high level}} of sizing to unbleached Douglas-fir kraft pulp, they have virtually no effect on bleached Douglas-fir kraft pulp and bleached hardwood chemical pulp. The reason is believed to be due to the difference in lignin content of the unbleached and bleached pulps. Two possible structures of the complex formed between these transition metal ions and lignin are postulated. The excellent sizing results induced by iron ions in mechanical pulp strongly support this hypothesis. Finally, metal ions Mg²⁺, Mn²⁺, Fe²⁺, Fe³⁺, Cu²⁺ and Zn²⁺ are used with polyamines as mordants of <b>rosin</b> soap <b>size.</b> While Mg²⁺/PEI and Mn²⁺/PEI shows no effect and Fe³⁺/PEI is very effective in an acidic pH range, Zn²⁺/PEI can induce moderate sizing and Fe²⁺/PEI and Cu²⁺/PEI can induce very high levels of sizing under neutral to alkaline conditions (up to pH 10 with Cu²⁺ /PEI) in various pulps.

The optimum sizing conditions, as well as the mechanism that modified polyamines/polyaminoamides use to <b>size</b> <b>rosin,</b> is investigated. Polyethyleneimine modified with epi-chlorohydrin was used in these studies. Rosin dosage was found to be the main variable that controlled the degree of sizing achieved. As the only hydrophobic material added, this was expected. In addition to rosin dosage, the polymer and pH had significant impacts on this sizing chemistry. Laboratory data shows that the synthesis procedure for and structure of polyethyleneimine-epi-cholohydrin (PEI-epi) impacts the degree of sizing achieved. Use of different modification techniques and degrees of modification illustrated several key factory regarding the polymer as a <b>rosin</b> <b>sizing</b> mordant. Prevention or removal of by-products from epi-chlorohydrin imporves the sizing efficiency of PEI-epi with rosin. A critical molecular weight of the PEI-epi was found to be important to sizing. Higher charge density on PEI-epi provides better the sizing efficiency. In addition to the polymer, other important factors where examined. The pH of the stock impacted the degree of sizing and permanency of the sizing achieved. Varying stock pH showed changes in sizing that are consistent with effects seen for rosin retention and of PAE as a wet strength agent. Low and high pH levels also caused reversion of the sizing effect. A pilot trial of the PEI-epi-rosin sizing chemistry was conducted at the Herty Foundation. The pilot trial shows that PEI-epi-rosin can reach the required level of sizing for linerboard. Trial results showed that calcium carbonate filled sheets could be sized by this chemistry. No significant impact on strength is seen from the sizing chemistry at the required dosage levels. As would be expected, addition of filler diminishes sheet strength. No sizing reversion was seen from any samples of this trial. Size reversion at low stock pH indicated that acid catalytic cleavage of an ester bond could have been occurring. Addition of acid or base to permanently sized sheets showed significant levels of reversion, similar to that seen for low stock pH sheets. This provides further supporting eviden ce for the formation and importance of an ester bond between rosin and PEI-epi. FTIR spectra were collected for model compounds to further examine the presence and importance of ester bonds. An ester bond was found to form at room temperature with aging or immediately with drying. Further, the ester bonds were found to decrease when the sample was subjected to acidic or basic environments. Solid state NMR was run to demonstrate the presence and importance of ester bonds to sizing in handsheets. Use of a [superscript 13]C labeled fatty acid showed that the ester bond peak dominated when sizing was present. After treatment with sodium hydroxide, the sizing disappeared and much of the ester bond signal shifted to a carboxylic acid or salt. Further solid state NMR of a non-reactive cationic polymer or a fully pre-reacted PEI-epi polymer shows retention of the fatty acid, but no ester bond and no sizing. The sizing mechanism of PEI-epi-rosin sizing appears to be connected to an ester bond formed during drying or with aging. While the amount of rosin retained controls the degree of sizing, retention alone is not enough to give sizing. The most effective pH for this sizing chemistry is near neutral, pH 6 - 8. FTIR and solid state NMR shows that an epichlorohydrin modified polyamine can form ester bonds with fatty acids in handsheets under conditions comparable to papermaking. The presence of residual acid or base in handsheets destroys the sizing effect achieved. Destruction of the sizing by addition of sodium hydroxide parallels the cleavage of many of the ester bonds present. PEI-epi appears to function as a mordant for rosin by creating an ester bond to anchor and help orient the hydrophobic portion of rosin. Ph. D. Advisor: Yulin Deng, Ph. D. Assoc.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 A {{series of}} {{chemical}} penetrants are employed {{to investigate the}} chemical characteristics of size bonds in different sizing systems. The bonding strength has been proved {{to be determined by}} the type of bonding. In rosinalum size the size bond is an indirect coordinate bond, which is vulnerable to the attack by acid, alkaline and especially by aluminum-affinited ligands, in which ligand substitutions take place and determine the rate of ink penetration in the Hercules Size Test (HST) test. Alkyl Ketene Dimer (AKD) can react with cellulose to form a direct fl-keto ester bond. This covalent bond is strong enough to resist the attack of acid or alkaline and is almost inert to these chemicals. However, if a small amount of alum is used in AKD sizing, there will be two types of size bond existed in the acid condition. Therefore, different HST values will be observed depending on what ink is used. A hypothesized mechanism about ligand substitution has been proposed and verified indirectly. This simple desizing approach provides important information on sizing mechanisms and will benefit new sizing agent research. As a new approach to <b>rosin</b> soap <b>sizing,</b> it was found that dipping handsheets in the rosin soap solution and drying the sheets at elevated temperatures could induce effective sizing on different pulps. No mordant (alum) is needed in this process. The pH of the dipping solution seems to have little effect on the sizing result. Some desizing inks with strong effects on conventional <b>rosin</b> soap <b>sized</b> paper were found to have little desizing effect on these type of handsheets. These facts strongly indicate that covalent ester linkages could be the bonds that form between rosin molecules and fibers in this process. The dry schedule, heat temperature, and the concentration of dipping solution have shown various effects on the sizing results depending on the types of pulp used. Completely understanding the sizing mechanism and making this process commercial is well worth additional research work. This method, however, suffers from its speed of fugitiveness...|$|R
40|$|Aiming {{to advance}} in the {{understanding}} of pollutant dispersion near arterial roads, we measured, simultaneously, meteorological parameters, emission mass rates and TSP, PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations at several locations downwind two roads, located on a flat region without any other source of pollutants. We also implemented on a state of the art commercial CFD software, an air quality model to simulate the dispersion of solid and gas-phase pollutants emitted from arterial roads. Numerical results of long-term averages and daily measurements of particle concentration showed high correlation with experimental measurements (R 2  >  0. 76). We found that the plots of pollutants concentration vs distance to the road edge describe a unique curve when expressed in terms of non-dimensional numbers and that this curve is well described by a beta function. Profiles of vertical concentration sketch an exponential function at the road edge, an S shape downwind and a flat shape far from the road. Particles exhibit a <b>Rosin</b> Rambler <b>size</b> distribution with average diameter of ~  7  μm. This distribution remains unaltered downwind from the road, which implies that at any location, PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations are a constant fraction of TPS concentration. Experimental data confirmed this observation. Previous results can be used to determine the size of the area impacted by roads, identify mitigating and adaptive countermeasures, and to improve the accuracy of vehicular emission factors...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{moisture}} on the mechanical properties of one commercial solid fiberboard grade {{and on the}} compression strength of mill-fabricated transport boxes made from this material were studied. The solid fiberboard (1220 g/m 2) has four middle layers made of old corrugated container (OCC). The middle layers are strongly internally <b>sized</b> with <b>rosin</b> <b>sizing.</b> The outer layers on both sides are made of bleached machine finished kraft paper. The kraft paper has extrusion coated low-density polyethylene (LDPE) doublelayer as moisture barrier. The six paper and paperboard layers are glued together in an industrial lamination process. The boxes have unusual design including double-panel walls and webbed corners, and they are used in wet and humid conditions for transporting fresh round fish. The transportation takes up to eight days at the ambient environment of 4 °C and 90 - 100 % RH. These conditions are taken as {{the framework of the}} study. Results show that the LDPE coating considerably slows down the transverse moisture penetration. The in-plane diffusivity (5. 9 · 10 - 10 m 2 /s, 27 °C, 50 / 90 % RH) was determined with an integrated unsteady state moisture transport model and was found to be nine times higher than the transverse diffusivity through the PE layer. Based on the diffusivity, water vapor can theoretically affect 80 mm from the open unsealed board edge during transport. Experiments show that liquid water penetrates 40 - 50 mm during eight days. In the middle of the sheet the moisture content increases moderately, approximately 0. 3 percentage points during transport. The packaging producer’s main concern is thus to ensure that the open material edges are at least 80 mm away from the load bearing sections of the box. Due to uneven moisture penetration into the boxes, the average moisture of a box is a questionable measure {{of moisture}} pick-up. Instead one should consider the moisture content of the load bearing parts. The role of the adhesion layers in bending stiffness of the solid paperboard was modeled with laminate models. Results show that the adhesion layers affect the mechanical properties of the combined board and need to be addressed in the models. Best agreement with the measured bending stiffness values was obtained by a 11 -layer model, where the properties of the adhesion layers are taken from the paper-glue-paper sandwich tests. The PE and kraft paper are regarded as one layer in the model. With this model, the calculated bending stiffnesses are close to the measured reference at 50 % RH in MD (difference 1 %). In 90 % RH and in MD the results are 14 % lower. Neglecting the adhesion layers gives 5 % lower values in 50 % RH and 18 % in 90 % RH compared to the reference measurement in MD. In each of the cases, the difference from reference is larger for the CD material direction. Three thickness measurement techniques (ISO, STFI, and SEM) were used to gather input data for the bending stiffness model. In this application, the ISO technique provided best results compared to the other techniques. It was found that the top-to bottom failure of a box can be expressed as a critical vertical displacement that is independent of moisture content. Similar results have been previously discovered when studying simpler structures like corrugated board panels and regular slotted containers (RSC). This research indicates that the strain dependent failure criterion also applies on more complex box structures.

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of paper sizing in fatty acid soap size-alum systems was studied by structural {{analyses of the}} size components in handsheets prepared with 13 C-labeled fatty acid soap size. Patterns of sizing performance and aluminum content of the handsheets {{were similar to those}} for the <b>rosin</b> soap size-alum <b>sizing</b> systems, although the patterns of calcium content were different. Solid-state 13 C-nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the handsheets revealed that fatty acid calcium salt was the predominant size component in the handsheets prepared using tap water. This calcium salt is formed from the fatty acid soap size (fatty acid potassium salt) by ion exchange with calcium ion in pulp suspensions and retained on pulp fibers through aluminum compounds originating from alum added. On the other hand, when deionized water was used, free fatty acid was the major component in the handsheets. Fatty acid aluminum salt was present as a minor component in the handsheets prepared in both tap water and deionized water systems. Therefore, all size components (i.e., fatty acid calcium salt, free fatty acid, fatty acid aluminum salt) seem to contribute to the appearance of sizing features.|$|R
30|$|Sizing is {{a widely}} used process to impart water {{resistance}} to paper and paperboard by treating fiber substrate with hydrophobic substance. There {{are two types of}} sizing: surface sizing and internal sizing. Internal sizing chemicals used in papermaking at the wet end are Alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) [14 – 16], alkyl succinic anhydride (ASA) [17] and <b>rosin</b> [18]. Surface <b>sizing</b> agents consist of mainly modified starches and other chemicals, such as waterborne polyurethane [19, 20], styrene/acrylic type polymers [21 – 23]. Surface sizing agents are amphiphilic molecules having both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) ends. The sizing agent adheres to fibers substrate and forms a film, with the hydrophilic tail facing the fiber and the hydrophobic tail facing outwards, resulting in a smooth finish that tends to be water-repellent, which can prevent water to wetting the paper sheet. What is wetting? Wetting is the ability of liquids to form interfaces with solid surfaces. To determine the degree of wetting, the water contact angle that is formed between the liquid and the solid surface is measured, which is a good indicator of wetting or dewetting. The smaller the water contact angle and the smaller the surface tension, the greater the degree of wetting [24]. The Young’s equation describes wetting if 0 ° ≤ θ <  90 ° and non-wetting if θ >  90 °, which mean a water drop spreading out to increase the contact surface on a hydrophilic surface, but minimizing the contact surface on a hydrophobic surface. By the same token, for paper or paperboard, the greater the water contact angle, the better the water resistance. From the Young’s equation, the high surface tension of solid is more easily wetted than that of low surface tension. Surface sizing agents are amphiphilic molecules, having both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) ends. The sizing agent adheres to substrate fibers and forms a film, with the hydrophilic tail facing the fiber and the hydrophobic tail facing outwards, resulting in a smooth finish that tends to reduce the surface tension of the sheet, which make the paper sheet water-repellent and which is also the surface sizing mechanism.|$|R
