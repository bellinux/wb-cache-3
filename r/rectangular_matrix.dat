40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} twenty-five years {{there has been}} much {{research}} into “fast” matrix multiplication methods: ones that have an asymptotically smaller operation count than conventional multiplication. Most fast methods are derived for square matrices, but they can be applied to <b>rectangular</b> <b>matrices</b> by a blocking technique. We obtain an expression for the order of the operation count for this blocked multiplication of <b>rectangular</b> <b>matrices.</b> We derive an exact operation count for Strassen's method with <b>rectangular</b> <b>matrices</b> and determine the recursion threshold that minimizes the operation count. We also show that when Strassen's method is used to multiply <b>rectangular</b> <b>matrices</b> it is more efficient to use the method on the whole product than to apply the method to square submatrices. Fast multiplication methods can be exploited in calculating a QR decomposition of an m × n matrix. We show that the operation count can be reduced from O(mn 2) to O(mn 1 +(1 (4 -α))) by using a fast multiplication method with exponent α in conjunction with Bischof and Van Loan's WY representation of a product of Householder transformations...|$|R

50|$|Performing an in-place {{transpose}} (in-situ transpose) is {{most difficult}} when N ≠ M, i.e. for a non-square (<b>rectangular)</b> <b>matrix,</b> where {{it involves a}} complicated permutation of the data elements, with many cycles of length greater than 2. In contrast, for a square matrix (N = M), all of the cycles are of length 1 or 2, and the transpose {{can be achieved by}} a simple loop to swap the upper triangle of the matrix with the lower triangle. Further complications arise if one wishes to maximize memory locality in order to improve cache line utilization or to operate out-of-core (where the matrix does not fit into main memory), since transposes inherently involve non-consecutive memory accesses.|$|E
