2500|$|Lambert {{stopped the}} work {{at this stage of}} {{fabrication}} and shipped the non-working engine and incomplete automobile to a small machine shop that he owned in Ohio City. This way he could then devote his personal attention to the engine and automobile when he could from his businesses he was running there. The automobile consisted of two clutches and two chains, which were connected to a jack shaft. The two clutches gave two speeds forward and there was no <b>reverse</b> <b>speed</b> used. The single front wheel of the tricycle designed automobile was steered by a foot lever and a hand lever. This direct steering method provided that the arms could be rested and the steering done by the feet, and vice versa. One item that needed to be solved for completion and a working engine was a means of carburation. Lambert heard of a means of vaporizing gasoline by Gottlieb Daimler of Germany. He went to New York to see the engine that was operating a boat. After seeing this complicated carburetor Lambert developed what he called the [...] "vaporizer." [...] This was a simpler carburetor than Daimler's, which he was then able to get the engine working the way he intended it to. The automobile was completed soon after he had it Ohio City.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Rencently, {{due to the}} {{increasing}} vehicles and traffic accidents, the demand of vehcile automation is growing fast, and the traditional vehicle control strategy can’t meet the requirement of security. In this paper, we propose a novel vehicle <b>reversing</b> <b>speed</b> control based on obstacle detection. The main components of the system consist of three parts. Firstly, a binocular-cameras system aims to detect the obstacles behind the vehicle rear and measure the distance of them. Then, the framework of particle filter and the sparse representation is indtroduced to track and identify the main obstacles such as human beings, vehicles and any other obstacles. Finally, we send the obstacles signal to our Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to control the electronic throttle and Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) {{so as to make}} <b>reversing</b> <b>speed</b> under a safe speed range. The last performance evaluation demonstrates the validity of the proposed vehicle <b>reversing</b> <b>speed</b> control based on obstacle detection...|$|R

5000|$|The clutch {{was made}} by W.C. Lips, Model Z-32-S, and the {{transmission}} was an IHC Model F-54-D. This transmission had 5 forward and one <b>reverse</b> <b>speed.</b> The first speed was very low, fifth speed was direct.|$|E
50|$|For road use {{the rear}} axle was driven, power being {{switchable}} {{also to the}} front axle for off-road use. The gear box provided three forward speeds and one <b>reverse</b> <b>speed</b> for road use, and for off-road use a lower “crawler” ratio was available. There was no limited slip differential but the vehicle’s light weight and the available gearing nevertheless provided excellent off-road capability.|$|E

50|$|In 1943, the Directorate of Tank Design, under Sir Claude Gibb, C.B.E., F.R.S., {{was asked}} to produce a new design for a heavy cruiser tank under the General Staff {{designation}} A41. After a series of fairly mediocre designs in the A series in the past, and bearing in mind {{the threat posed by}} the German 88 mm gun, the War Office demanded a major revision of the design requirements, specifically: increased durability and reliability, the ability to withstand a direct hit from the German 88 mm gun and providing greater protection against mines. Initially in September 1943 the A41 tank was to weigh no more than 40 tons; the limit for existing Mark I and Mark II transport trailers, and for a Bailey Bridge of 80 ft (24m) span. The British railway loading gauge required that the width should not exceed 10 ft 8 in (3.2m) and the optimum width was 10 ft 3 in (3.1m). A high top speed was not important, while agility was to be equal to that of the Comet. A high <b>reverse</b> <b>speed</b> was specified, as during the fighting in southern Italy, Allied tanks were trapped in narrow sunken roads by the German Army. The modified production gearbox had a two-speed reverse, with the higher <b>reverse</b> <b>speed</b> similar to second gear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Series DC motor {{has a high}} {{starting}} torque and therefore it is used in traction applications. <b>Reversing</b> <b>speed</b> direction of this machine is conventionally achieved via a relay arrangement which results in waste of energy during braking. Regenerative operation reduces the time taken to stop the machine and feeds energy back to the supply, hence improves the overall performance and efficiency. In this paper, a novel reversible DC series motor drive is presented which allows both speed control within the constant torque region and <b>reversing</b> <b>speed</b> direction through regenerative operation while providing the conventional performance of the DC series motor. The field winding {{is connected to the}} armature via an uncontrolled bridge rectifier to keep direction of field current unchanged. The armature and rectifier field combination is connected to a DC supply via a class E-chopper. The operation of the proposed reversible drive is explained and the dynamic model is presented. The switching of the chopper is controlled so as to provide positive and negative voltage loops across the series, armature-rectified field windings. The transient response of the open loop control system is theoretically simulated using MATLAB software and experimentally investigated using the PIC 16 F 877 microcontroller...|$|R
50|$|Semi-truck {{transmissions}} {{can have}} {{as few as}} three forward speeds or as many as 18 forward <b>speeds</b> (plus 2 <b>reverse</b> <b>speeds).</b> A large number of transmission ratios means the driver can operate the engine more efficiently.

50|$|The {{prototype}} Type 98 20 mm AAG Tank {{was equipped}} with modified twin Type 2 20 mm AA machine cannon. The guns were similar to the Type 98 anti-aircraft cannon, but these could be elevated to 95 degrees and had a central fire-control system. The rate of fire was 300 rpm, {{and they had a}} maximum range of 5,500 m. The gunner sat in the seat right behind the gun. The platform allowed 360 degrees of rotation for both the gunner and the gun. A Type 100 air-cooled inline six-cylinder diesel engine was used to output 130 horsepower. Forward transmission included four stages, with one <b>reverse</b> <b>speed.</b> Type 98 Ke-Ni chassis and engine, on which the prototype was based managed a speed 42 km/h.

50|$|Hydrostatic {{transmissions}} use {{a variable}} displacement pump and a hydraulic motor. All power is transmitted by hydraulic fluid. These types can generally transmit more torque, but can be sensitive to contamination. Some designs are also very expensive. However, they have the advantage that the hydraulic motor can be mounted directly to the wheel hub, allowing a more flexible suspension system and eliminating efficiency losses from friction in the drive shaft and differential components. This type of transmission {{is relatively easy to}} use because all forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>speeds</b> can be accessed using a single lever.|$|R
50|$|The 6TD-2 engine {{drives a}} French-designed hydro-mechanical {{automatic}} transmission, the SESM ESM500, {{which is also}} fitted to the Leclerc MBT. Capable of manual and fully automatic power-shifting, the transmission has 5 forward and 2 <b>reverse</b> <b>speeds</b> along with a braking system that incorporates carbon friction brakes and a secondary speed-retarding system. Gear changes are controlled by a torque converter which is made more efficient by addition of an automatic lock-up clutch. There is also a mechanical back-up system for use in emergencies, able to shift 2 gears forward and reverse.|$|R

50|$|The T-18's chassis and {{suspension}} was improved {{from the}} T-16 {{by the addition}} of an extra support roller and an independent vertical spring suspension. The 300 mm track of the T-16 was transferred over to the T-18, with some improvements. The engine, a vertical, four-cylinder MS engine, was designed and improved upon by Alexander Mikulin. The engine was capable of a maximum of 35 horsepower. The MS engine was combined with the PSC transmission in one unit rather than being in two separate housings. The PSC transmission gave the tank four forward speeds and one <b>reverse</b> <b>speed.</b> The engine-transmission compartment in the back let air in via holes drilled in the rear plate. This improved protection, but also led to the engine overheating. Electrical equipment included a 6-volt battery, magneto and dynamo, which fed the lamp, horn, rear light, light distribution panel and two portable lamps.|$|E
