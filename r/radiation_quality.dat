Studies of animal carcinogenesis with HZE nuclei are extremely limited {{in number and}} the use of tumor-prone animals introduces bias into the results. Relative biological effectiveness factors comparing gamma rays to HZE ions were measured in mice or rats for tumors of the skin and of the Harderian or mammary gland, reaching values as high as 25 to 50 at low doses. However, the risk and detriment of cancer will not be fully characterized until the relationship between <b>radiation</b> <b>quality</b> and latency, where tumors appear earlier after high-LET irradiation, is adequately described. The earlier latency and increasing effectiveness that is fund with HZE ions that are similar to those in earlier studies with neutrons, together with the lack of response of gamma rays that is seen in many low-dose studies, suggests that the scaling concepts that are used in current risk assessment approaches are unable to describe important qualitative effects, and that relative biological effectiveness factors may, in principle, be indefinable or a faulty concept.|$|E

In fast neutron therapy, an operational approach has been adopted which is based on the concept of "clinical RBE".

In particular, the difference between the well defined RBE in radiation biology and the clinical RBE which is based on the judgement of radiotherapists is elucidated and emphasized. The clinical RBE is based on the reference RBE and implicitly includes differences in physical selectivity of the irradiation beams and clinical experience. The particular aspects of <b>radiation</b> <b>quality</b> in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) are due to the poor penetration of the primary beam, the inhomogeneity of the spatial distribution of 10 B nuclides in the irradiated tissue and the short range of the alpha-particles emitted after neutron capture in 10 B.

Microarrays and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) are considered the two cornerstones of gene expression analysis. In interpreting these results it is critical to normalize the expression levels of the target genes by that of appropriately selected endogenous control genes (ECGs) or housekeeping genes. We sought to systematically investigate common ECG candidates for their stability after different radiation modalities in different human cell lines by qRT-PCR. We aimed to identify the most robust set of ECGs or housekeeping genes for transcriptional analysis in irradiation studies. Methods We tested the expression stability of 32 ECGs in three human cancer cell lines. The epidermoid carcinoma cells (A 431), the non small cell lung carcinoma cells (A 549) and the pancreatic adenocarincoma cells (BxPC 3) were irradiated with photon, proton and carbon ions. Expression Heat maps, clustering and statistic algorithms were employed using SUMO software package. The expression stability was evaluated by computing: mean, standard deviation, ANOVA, coefficient of variation and the stability measure (M) given by the geNorm algorithm. Results Expression analysis revealed significant cell type specific regulation of 18 out of 32 ECGs (p [*] 18 S, one of the most frequently used ECG, was differentially regulated as the function of different <b>radiation</b> <b>qualities</b> (p [*]≤[*] 0. 01). A comprehensive search for the most stable ECGs using the geNorm algorithm identified 3 ECGs for A 431 and BxPC 3 to be sufficient for normalization.

40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} {{can affect}} the immune system in many ways. Depending on the situation, the whole body or {{parts of the body}} can be acutely or chronically exposed to different <b>radiation</b> <b>qualities.</b> In tumor radiotherapy, a fractionated exposure of the tumor (and surrounding tissues) is applied to kill the tumor cells. Currently, mostly photons, and also electrons, neutrons, protons, and heavier particles such as carbon ions, are used in radiotherapy. Tumor elimination can be supported by an effective immune response. In recent years, much progress has been achieved in the understanding of basic interactions between the irradiated tumor and the immune system. Here, direct and indirect effects of radiation on immune cells have to be considered. Lymphocytes for example are known to be highly radiosensitive. One important factor in indirect interactions is the radiation-induced bystander effect which can be initiated in unexposed cells by expression of cytokines of the irradiated cells and by direct exchange of molecules via gap junctions. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the indirect effects observed after exposure to different <b>radiation</b> <b>qualities.</b> The different immune cell populations important for the tumor immune response are natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and CD 8 + cytotoxic T-cells. In vitro and in vivo studies have revealed the modulation of their functions due to ionizing radiation exposure of tumor cells. After radiation exposure, cytokines are produced by exposed tumor and immune cells and a modulated expression profile has also been observed in bystander immune cells. Release of damage-associated molecular patterns by irradiated tumor cells is another factor in immune activation. In conclusion, both immune-activating and -suppressing effects can occur. Enhancing or inhibiting these effects, respectively, could contribute to modified tumor cell killing after radiotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Radiotherapy aims to {{sterilize}} cancer cells through ionization induced damages to their DNA whilst {{trying to reduce}} dose burdens to healthy tissues. This can be achieved {{to a certain extent}} by optimizing the choice of radiation to treat the patient, i. e. the types of particles and their energy based on their specific interaction patterns. In particular, the formation of complex clusters of energy deposits (EDs) increases with the linear energy transferred for a given particle. These differences cause variation in the relative biological effectiveness (RBE). The complexity of ED clusters might be related to complex forms of DNA damage, which are more difficult to repair and therefore prone to inactivate the cells. Hence, mapping of the number and complexity of ED clusters for different <b>radiation</b> <b>qualities</b> could aid to infer a surrogate measure substituting physical dose and LET as main predictors for the RBE.   In this work the spatial patterns of EDs at the nanometre scale were characterized for various energies of proton, helium, lithium and carbon ions. A track structure Monte Carlo code, LIonTrack, was developed to accurately simulate the light ion tracks in liquid water. The methods to emulate EDs at clinical dose levels in cell nucleus-sized targets for both 60 Co photons and light ions were established, and applied to liquid water targets. All EDs enclosed in such targets were analyzed with a specifically developed cluster algorithm where clustering was defined by a single parameter, the maximum distance between nearest neighbour EDs. When comparing measured RBE for different <b>radiation</b> <b>qualities,</b> there are cases for which RBE do not  increase with LET but instead increase with the frequencies of high order ED clusters.

40|$|<b>Radiation</b> <b>quality</b> is {{described}} by the RBE (relative biological effectiveness) that varies with the ionizing ability of the radiation. Microdosimetric quantities describe distributions of energy imparted to small volumes and {{can be related to}} RBE. This has made microdosimetry a powerful tool for <b>radiation</b> <b>quality</b> determinations in both radiation protection and radiation therapy. The variance-covariance method determines the dose-average of the distributions and has traditionally been used with two detectors to correct for beam intensity variations. Methods to separate dose components in mixed radiation fields and to correct for beam variations using only one detector have been developed in this thesis. Quality factor relations have been optimized for different neutron energies, and a new algorithm that takes single energy deposition events from densely ionizing radiation into account has been formulated. The variance-covariance technique and the new methodology have been shown to work well in the cosmic radiation field onboard aircraft, in the mixed photon and neutron fields in the nuclear industry and in pulsed fields around accelerators. The method has also been used for <b>radiation</b> <b>quality</b> characterization in therapy beams. The biological damage is related to track-structure and ionization clusters and requires descriptions of the energy depositions in nanometre sized volumes. It was shown that both measurements and Monte Carlo simulation (condensed history and track-structure) are needed for a reliable nanodosimetric beam characterization. The combined experimental and simulated results indicate that the dose-mean of the energy imparted to an object in the nanometre region is related to the clinical RBE in neutron, proton and photon beams. The results suggest that the variance-covariance technique and the dose-average of the microdosimetric quantities could be well suited for describing <b>radiation</b> <b>quality</b> also in therapy beams...|$|E

Potential gene markers were identified. Equi-effect radiation doses, i. e. radiation doses and exposure conditions causing the same biological effect level, were determined in human T-lymphoma Jurkat cells with regard to micronucleus formation, γ-H 2 AX foci signal intensity and apoptosis induction after γ-irradiation (Cs- 137, 0. 7 Gy/min), α-irradiation (Am- 241, 0. 032 Gy/min) and exposure to the Auger electron emitter I- 123 which was incorporated as I- 123 -UdR into the DNA for 20 h. Radiation dose for I- 123 exposure was assessed by point-kernel calculations and 3 -D morphology of the cells. Whole human genome DNA-microarrays (Agilent) were employed to measure gene expression after exposure to equi-effect doses. RNA was isolated 6 and 24 h post-exposure. The criteria for candidate genes were a significant expression change (> 1. 5 fold; p< 0. 05) and no altered or even a conversely regulation {{in response to the}} other <b>radiation</b> <b>qualities.</b> Expression of selected candidate genes was validated via qRT-PCR. Biological processes and pathways of significantly regulated genes were subsequently analyzed.

40|$|An intercomparison of ring dosemeters {{has been}} {{organised}} {{with the aim}} of assessing the technical capabilities of available extremity dosemeters and focusing on their performance at clinical workplaces with potentially high extremity doses. Twenty-four services from 16 countries participated in the intercomparison. The dosemeters were exposed to reference photon (137 Cs) and beta (147 Pm, 85 Kr and 90 Sr/ 90 Y) fields together with fields representing realistic exposure situations in interventional radiology (direct and scattered radiation) and nuclear medicine (99 mTc and 18 F). It has been found that most dosemeters provided satisfactory measurements of Hp(0. 07) for photon radiation, both in reference and realistic fields. However, only four dosemeters fulfilled the established requirements for all <b>radiation</b> <b>qualities.</b> The main difficulties were found for the measurement of low-energy beta radiation. Finally, the results also showed a general under-response of detectors to 18 F, which was attributed to the difficulties of the dosimetric systems to measure the positron contribution to the dos...|$|R
