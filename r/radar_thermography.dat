Within {{the frame of}} the CHEF Contract, a flood was {{simulated}} by adding water to the full-scale salt contaminated model walls for a period of several days. The aim was to evaluate with ND techniques the evolution of the decay after the introduction of uncontaminated new water, simulating a flood. <b>Radar,</b> <b>thermography,</b> sonic tests as well as powder drilling tests were applied to evaluate the moisture distribution in the masonry, after flooding and after natural drying both on treated and non treated walls...|$|E

In the main façade and indoors there are erosive features (that can endanger decorative elements) and salt efflorescences with distributions that suggested the influence of capillary rising solutions, hypothesis supported by studies with ground penetrating <b>radar</b> and <b>thermography.</b> The extension of the weakening effect was assessed by measurements with a Drilling Resistance Measurement System. In the main façade, there are also erosive features at the upper portions, as well as black crust, salt efflorescences, biological colonization and other coatings.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, robotic {{technology}} has been increasingly employed in agriculture to develop intelligent vehicles that can improve productivity and competitiveness. Accurate and robust environmental perception is a critical requirement to address unsolved issues including safe interaction with field workers and animals, obstacle detection in controlled traffic applications, crop row guidance, surveying for variable rate applications, and situation awareness, in general, towards increased process automation. Given the variety of conditions that may be encountered in the field, no single sensor exists that can guarantee reliable results in every scenario. The development of a multi-sensory perception system to increase the ambient awareness of an agricultural vehicle operating in crop fields is {{the objective of the}} Ambient Awareness for Autonomous Agricultural Vehicles (QUAD-AV) project. Different onboard sensor technologies, namely stereovision, LIDAR, <b>radar,</b> and <b>thermography,</b> are considered. Novel methods for their combination are proposed to automatically detect obstacles and discern traversable from non-traversable areas. Experimental results, obtained in agricultural contexts, are presented showing the effectiveness of the proposed methods...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a study of}} technologically advanced methods for the point data data capturing of existing buildings, point cloud data processing the use {{in the development of}} structural building information model (BIM). As surveying techniques for the remote sensing technologies are considered as a main source of information for the geometry of buildings, we explore a wide spectrum of technologies, e. g., airborne laser scanning to short range 3 D scanners. Furthermore, the requirements and criteria for the use of point clouds, which are the main medium of geometric data for remote sensing in the observed BIM process are explained. In this context the point clouds software tools for BIM modeling are presented. As the point clouds only provide information about the surface of the structure, methods for the investigation of the invisible parts of the structure are presented, e. g., a ground penetrating <b>radar</b> and <b>thermography</b> are proposed. The last part of the thesis explains the process from field surveying {{to the development of a}} BIM model with an emphasis on the addition of the information that would allow for the use of BIM model for energy analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The civil {{engineering}} community asks for more non-destructive testing, quality control and sustainability of structures can be observed. For an economical use of non-destructive testing methods, technical information and {{knowledge about the}} capacity of existing test methods are necessary. Missing that information {{makes it more difficult}} to choose the right testing method for the investigation of concrete structures. To ensure a better and efficient application of test methods under local conditions, performance demonstrations of non-destructive testing methods have been accomplished. For this purpose, a special specimen (“LCS”) was concreted at BAM, to carry out performance tests of echo methods. The thickness of the specimen is varying and it contains different kind of faults, such as voids, honeycombs and prestressing tendons of varying quality. While the geometry and condition of the defects is well-known the performance of test methods like <b>radar,</b> ultrasonic, impactecho, <b>thermography</b> etc. can be compared. The research was conducted within the Research group FOR 384, sponsored by the German Research Society DFG. 1...|$|R
40|$|Non-destructive {{investigation}} of an eighteenth-century English lighthouse, undertaken {{as part of}} the European Commission Culture 2000 PHAROS historic lighthouses project, has provided an insight into the construction and condition of this significant structure. A preliminary building survey raised a series of questions, including confirmation of construction beneath external and internal render layers, changes in construction over the height of the structure, the absence/presence of metallic cramps or other reinforcement, and the penetration of stone cantilevered steps and structural members into the wall thickness. It was also necessary to know whether there were voids within the wall thickness, and if there was separation of the external and internal render layers from the substrate. Non-destructive {{investigation of}} sample areas of the lighthouse was undertaken using a combination of impulse <b>radar,</b> dynamic impedance, <b>thermography,</b> and pulsed ultrasound, with selective opening up to confirm survey data. These techniques have provided a useful means of determining the construction and condition of a historic lighthouse, although the value of such work lies as much with the interpretation of data as with the application of the correct techniques...|$|R
40|$|The oratory of St. Giuseppe dei Minimi in L’Aquila, Italy, {{sustained}} {{serious damage}} after the seismic events of April 2009. The earthquake caused out- of-plane overturning of the façade, with wide cracks on both lateral walls. Such rotation caused the “sinking” in {{the crack of}} one of the pillars of the belfry, which did not collapse, but remained in a very dangerous situation. After the initial stabilisation measures, carried out during the months following the seismic event, field investigations were carried out by the authors in spring- summer 2010, to guide the final strengthening intervention, supervised by the Italian Ministry of Culture. The investigation campaign involved intensive use of non and minor destructive techniques, such as <b>thermography,</b> <b>radar,</b> sonic tests, core sampling, single and double flat jack tests and chemical analysis on sampled materials. Moreover, the overall dynamic characteristics of the church were extracted from vibrations measured in the upper areas of the building, using output only techniques. Finally, a structural monitoring system was installed in the church (involving also the adjacent St. Biagio church), to monitor the damage progression and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} strengthening applications...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} present a recent {{integrated}} survey {{carried out on}} an archaeological urban site, generally free of buildings, except some temporary structures related to excavated areas where multi-chamber tombs were found. The two methods used to investigate this site were thermal infrared and ground penetrating <b>radar</b> (GPR). The <b>thermography</b> was carried out with the sensor mounted under a helium balloon simultaneously with a photographic camera. In {{order to have a}} synthetic view of the surface thermal behavior, a simplified version of the existing night thermal gradient algorithm was applied. By this approach, we have a wide extension of thermal maps due to the balloon oscillation, because we are able to compute the maps despite collecting few acquisition samples. By the integration of GPR and the thermal imaging, we can evaluate the depth of the thermal influence of possible archaeological targets, such as buried Punic tombs or walls belonging to the succeeding medieval buildings, which have been subsequently destroyed. The thermal anomalies present correspondences to the radar time slices obtained from 30 to 50 cm. Furthermore, by superimposing historical aerial pictures on the GPR and thermal imaging data, we can identify these anomalies as the foundations of the destroyed buildings...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results obtained}} by applying an extensive NDTs experimental investigation in order to evaluate the extent of structural damage and their causes. A correct preservation design of a historic structure should start from an accurate diagnosis {{of the state of}} damage based on: experimental on-site and laboratory investigacions, and a structural analysis using the result of said invesùgations. These operations will enhance knowledge of the building and help respect its authenticity through an appropriate choice of intervention techniques. The lack of knowledge about the originai materials and structures has frequently been the main cause of unsuccessful interventions. In this context a further problem was found, namely the modality of past intervention on the building with inappropriate techniques. The questions to be answered are: What actually caused the failures? How dìd they develop? and, How serious were theìr consequences to the overall response of the building? Masonry structures in seismic areas are subjected to severa!earthquakes during their lifetime, often followed by partia 1 reconstruccion. They can also suffer for lack of maintenance, so that synergetic effects can cause their damage. In order to overcome the gap between our poor knowledge and the complexity of these structures an experimental on-site investigation is required as well as recommended by the Codes and Standards of severa! countries. Non-Destructive Techniques (NDTs) and/or Minor Destructive Techniques (MDTs) can be helpful in detecting hidden features (wall texture, internal voids and Aaws and characteriscics of the wall section), which are crucial to define the structural behaviors under dead loads and environmental action. Before choosing the appropriate NDTs, it is therefore important to know which type of problem has to be solved, i. e. what is to be found by NDT. In the case of ND tests, a correlation between the measured parameters and the mechanical ones is usually difficult, but it can give an overall qualitative indication of the masonry. At present the most diffused ND techniques are sonic (or ultrasonic), <b>radar</b> and <b>thermography</b> tests. Sonic and radar tests seem to be very promising when a diagnosis has to be clone on the state of damage present in inhomogeneous materials; therefore the designer is asked to interpret the results and use them at least as comparative values betwecn different parts of the same structure'smasonry or by using different ND techniqucs...|$|R
40|$|Bridge decks {{are among}} the most {{expensive}} components of a bridge over the lifetime of the structure because they frequently require maintenance and rehabilitation. Currently, the Indiana Department of Transportation performs visual inspection as their principal means of determining condition in the deck. This only allows the inspector to truly tell the surface condition and speculate what is occurring below the surface. Because of this lack of quality data, INDOT implements programmatic scheduling of major work actions. Nondestructive testing methods that can locate corrosion and delamination exist, but they are not being utilized. ^ The primary objective {{of the study was to}} investigate the economic viability of using nondestructive testing to evaluate bridge deck condition and manage decisions on major work actions. First, nondestructive tests were evaluated to find out if they are, in fact, better at locating deterioration than current methods. Then, a project level comparison between the NDT methods was performed to show which method and combination of methods were the best from a cost perspective. Using the optimal combination of methods, a project level analysis on 30 bridge decks was performed, and the costs were compared to current programmatic schedules. Finally, this analysis was expanded to the network level, which includes the entire bridge inventory in Indiana. ^ The results of this study indicate that implementing nondestructive testing methods is financially beneficial. After a thorough literature review and conferring with NDT personnel, it is found that NDT methods are much better at assessing bridge deck condition than current methods of bridge deck inspection. From a cost perspective and on the project level, infrared thermography was the best individual equipment, while the best combination of NDT methods was chloride ion penetration, ground-coupled ground-penetrating <b>radar,</b> and infrared <b>thermography.</b> Only air-launched horn GPR and IR have highway speed capabilities, so they were the selected NDT combination for network level collection. In-house project level usage of NDT methods were less costly because of the fewer work actions being performed. Similarly, in-house network level usage of NDT methods compared to current methods leads to significant savings. When comparing consultants to in-house NDT use, it can be beneficial to utilize a consultant when their cost per area estimate is below the break-even point. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred on}} the 6 th of April 2009 in the Abruzzo Region of Italy seriously hit the Cultural Heritage (C. H.) patrimony with major destructive effects on l’Aquila, a city of 70, 000 inhabitants with the size and the historical and strategic importance of {{the capital of the}} Region. The emergency activities to protect the C. H. have been developed following two parallel levels: (i) damage survey and (ii) design and implementation of temporary safety measures. The organization of emergency actions was managed by a centralized structure, the so-called Function 15 “Protection of Cultural Heritage” directed by a Special Commissioner. The structure coordinated the on-site surveys of protected buildings and the design and implementation of temporary safety measures. Several Italian Universities during and after these first emergency actions were invited by the Commissioner to work on selected Case Histories: the aim was on the one hand to provide a first interpretation of the observed damages {{and on the other hand}} to define some guidelines for a higher level of investigation. In this paper the case study of the Spanish Fortress in L’Aquila supervised by the authors is reported with the description of the earthquake damages and the emergency intervention derived from the “Palaces template” [Ref. 1]. The emergency interventions were carried out in order to avoid progressive damages due to the following several aftershocks. The authors decided together with the officers of MiBAC (Ministry of C. H.) in L’Aquila to proceed with further on site investigations and monitoring. A series of non destructive and minor destructive testing were performed in the Spanish Fortress by the research groups of the Politecnico of Milan and the University of Padova in order to characterize and evaluate quantitatively and qualitatively the state of damage of the masonry structures (walls and pillars) and to identify the structural response of the most damaged wings of the building. The experimental campaigns included: (i) sonic pulse velocity tests, <b>radar</b> tests and <b>thermography,</b> (ii) single and double flat jack tests, (iii) dynamic identification tests. The ND tests were mainly aimed at defining the state of damage of the heavy pillars and of the transversal bearing walls on the ground floor and at designing the most effective strengthening interventions. Furthermore a permanent static and dynamic monitoring system was installed by the ISCR (Rome) and the University of Padova respectively in order to control the dynamic characteristics of the fortress, constantly verify the damage pattern of the structure and provide a step-by-step monitoring procedure during each phase of restoration...|$|R
