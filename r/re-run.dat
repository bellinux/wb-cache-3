5|$|The Jockey Club {{decided not}} to <b>re-run</b> the race, {{and as a result}} it has often been called the race that never was.

5|$|Captain Scarlet, {{the eighth}} of ten puppet series that the Andersons {{produced}} during the 1950s and 1960s, {{was preceded by}} Thunderbirds and followed by Joe 90 and The Secret Service. In terms of visual aesthetic, the series represented a departure from Thunderbirds on account of its use of non-caricatured puppets sculpted in realistic proportions. <b>Re-run</b> {{a number of times}} in the UK and purchased by the BBC in 1993, the 32-episode series has entailed tie-in merchandise since its first appearance, from dolls to original novels and comic strips in the Century 21 Publications children's magazine, TV Century 21.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Wilde, a {{critical}} study by Arthur Ransome {{was published in}} 1912. The book only briefly mentioned Wilde's life, but subsequently Ransome (and The Times Book Club) were sued for libel by Lord Alfred Douglas. The trial in April 1913 was in a way a <b>re-run</b> of the trials of Oscar Wilde. The trial resulted from Douglas's rivalry with Robbie Ross for Wilde (and his need of money). Douglas lost after a reading of De Profundis refuted his claims.|$|E

5|$|However, 70000 {{had been}} {{purchased}} privately from British Railways by the Britannia Locomotive Group, therefore {{ensuring that the}} doyen of the class was to survive into the preservation era. Subsequently, utilised on mainline railtours, the locomotive was out of use in the late 1990s, requiring work {{to bring it back}} to steam; it was eventually sold to Pete Waterman and stored at Crewe. After a spell in storage on the Bressingham Steam Museum in Diss, Norfolk, 70013 was moved to the Great Central Railway (preserved), following an ownership dispute between Bressingham and the National Railway Museum. The locomotive returned to steam in May 2008 on the Great Central Railway after the readers of Steam Railway magazine contributed towards its overhaul. In July 2008 it appeared in WCRC's Open Weekend at Steamtown, Carnforth. August saw the locomotive return to the main line. Its first turn was the 1T57 'Fifteen Guinea Special' <b>re-run</b> from Manchester to Carlisle, 40 years after it performed the same duty in 1968. As a result, both preserved members of the class have operated on the mainline in preservation.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{unprecedented}} <b>re-run</b> {{occurred in}} the women's 4 × 100 metres relay heats: Brazil's second leg runner Franciela Krasucki accidentally obstructed American Allyson Felix during the baton exchange, causing Felix to drop the baton.

25|$|Model Dockyard was {{the first}} to release a brass, ready-to-run model of the {{locomotive}} in 1967. The units were generic, unpainted models and significantly pre-dated the modern preservation era, so none of the more modern features are represented. The engines were packaged in a blue box with foam interiors, and were fitted with Triang-style motor and gearbox which projected into the locomotive cab, and retailed for $78AUD. The units were manufactured by Kumata in Japan. A <b>re-run</b> was produced in Korea in 1982, using a newer, smaller can motor design which allowed for in-cab detailing.|$|E
25|$|Rebuffed by Congress, Wilson {{announced}} on April 30, 1980, Statehood Day in Louisiana, {{that he would}} challenge Leach in the 1980 nonpartisan blanket primary.

Wilson said that he expected to raise and spend $500,000 for the second race because national Republicans had again targeted the Fourth District as one of 35 in the nation where the GOP stood a chance of winning a Democratic seat.|$|E
