5|$|After {{the ball}} {{rolled into the}} end zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick {{in order to have a}} chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E

5|$|Kansas {{received}} Virginia Tech's kickoff, and the Hokies {{attempted to}} give themselves another chance at offense by calling timeouts after Kansas rushed the ball. The timeouts stopped the clock, but Kansas managed {{to earn a}} first down and <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> clock after Tech used its allotted threetimeouts. Heading into halftime, Kansas still had the lead and the momentum, but a Virginia Tech touchdown had cut the Jayhawks' lead to just 10points, 177.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Humanitarian Bowl Most Valuable Player honors {{were awarded}} to Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott, who rushed for 174yards, and Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who threw for 370yards. Each was the {{statistical}} leader at his respective position, and Scott scored Maryland's two final touchdowns {{to break the}} 28–28 stalemate. Scott also was able to help Maryland clinch the victory in the final minutes by rushing for a first down that allowed the team to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> clock.|$|E

5|$|With just a {{few seconds}} {{remaining}} in the first half, there appeared to be little chance that Nebraska would have a chance to score. But Nebraska received the kickoff at its 24-yard line and returned it to the Nebraska 42. Frost attempted a long pass to get Nebraska into position for a field goal attempt, but the throw fell incomplete. Instead of trying another long pass, Nebraska proceeded to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> clock, and the Cornhuskers went into halftime with a 1714 lead.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} Louisville's kickoff, Virginia Tech {{elected to}} <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> clock {{and bring the}} first half to an end. During the process, Marcus Vick ran the ball on a designed play and was tackled by Cardinals defensive end Elvis Dumervil after Vick gained nine yards. Following the play, Vick paused, then stomped on Dumervil's leg. Though referees failed to observe the stomp, television commentators replayed the action, and Tech coaches considered pulling Vick from the game as punishment. At {{the end of the}} first half of play, Louisville held a 17–10 lead.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn began to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> clock. The Tigers failed {{to pick up}} a first down, and after going three and out, punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, their offense again on the field, began running out the clock again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the clock with each timeout. Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out, and the Tigers again punted the ball away with 2:13 remaining.|$|E

5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> side of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|California {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 35-yard line following the post-touchdown kickoff and a short return. The Bears began to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> clock, rushing the ball more than passing it, as had been the trend throughout the game. Though Aaron Rodgers completed four passes during the drive for 38yards, J. J. Arrington and Vincent Strang rushed the ball a total of eight times during the possession. California ran 7:09 off the clock before Vincent Strang broke free for a 13-yard rush {{that resulted in a}} touchdown. The score restored California's 14-point lead, making the game 49–35 with 6:26 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the kickoff}} and return, backup Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller entered {{the game to}} guide the Hokies' offense. The first play of the drive, however, was a run by backup running back Ken Oxendine, who gained five yards. Two more runs by Oxendine failed to gain a first down, however, and Virginia Tech punted. Tennessee's Sean Summers {{returned}} the kick to the Volunteers' 40-yard line, and the Volunteers continued trying to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> clock. Tennessee failed to gain a first down, and the resulting punt rolled {{into the end zone}} for a touchback.|$|E

5|$|Having {{recovered}} the ball, and with Virginia Tech having no remaining timeouts {{and no way}} to stop the clock, Florida State was able to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> remaining time in the game and secure a 2722 victory. Towards the end of the game, players on each team acted with hostility towards each other, and several received personal foul penalties. The penalties had no effect on the final outcome of the game, and Florida State won the ACC Championship Game and an automatic bid to the 2006 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Jud Dunlevy {{kicked the}} ball, which {{traveled}} the regulation 10yards, but was recovered by Kansas. The Hokies, despite failing {{to recover the}} onside kick, still had a chance for another offensive possession if they stopped Kansas' offense short of a first down. Because the Hokies had two timeouts remaining, they could stop the clock after two Kansas plays, thus preserving time for a Virginia Tech offensive drive. An 11-yard pass by Todd Reesing netted Kansas a first down, however, and subsequent runs by the Jayhawks allowed Kansas to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> clock despite the Virginia Tech timeouts. Kansas preserved its lead by kneeling on the ball inside the Virginia Tech 5-yard line on the final plays of the game, and the 2421 victory was celebrated as time ran out.|$|E
5|$|Kaepernick {{took over}} on the Nevada 23-yard line with 4:01and made four {{completions}} {{to drive to the}} Terps' 15-yard line. Exploiting a large opening, Kaepernick held onto the ball and ran it into the end zone to narrow Maryland's lead to one touchdown, 42–35, with 2:19remaining. Jaekle attempted an onside kick in an effort to give Nevada another chance on offense, but the ball was recovered by Maryland receiver Danny Oquendo. Scott rushed for two and then 19yards. With the first down, Maryland had enough time to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> clock and clinch the 42–35victory.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} morning, English tailender Alec Bedser had reached 37. His partner Denis Compton hit a {{ball into the}} covers and Bradman and Loxton {{collided}} {{in an attempt to}} field the ball and prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end. Bedser was a long way short of the crease and was <b>run</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> wicket ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 in a 121-run partnership. England then lost their last three wickets for 26 runs to be all out for 363.|$|E
5|$|The Eagles' post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 33-yard line, and on the first play after the kick, Boston College committed a personal foul penalty when Tyrod Taylor was hit out of bounds. Following the penalty, the ball was advanced to the Tech 42-yard line and the Hokies were given a first down. Tech completed two short passes, advancing to the 50-yard line, but the Hokies punted after not gaining another first down. The kick sailed out of bounds, and the Eagles returned to offense with 19 seconds remaining in the first half. Rather than try to score quickly, Boston College elected to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> clock with Virginia Tech leading, 14–7.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{travelled}} to Massachusetts to {{face the}} New England Patriots at Foxboro Stadium in Week 17. The game was a de facto home game, as many Giants fans made the trip up to Foxborough to sell the stadium out. The game had no playoff implications for the Giants, who could not surpass the 49ers for the #1 seed in the NFC playoffs. The Giants rushed for a season-high 213yards, led by Hostetler's 82yards on 10 carries. The Patriots' Jason Staurovsky missed a potential game-tying 42-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, and Hostetler then ran a 30-yard bootleg on a key third-down play to allow the Giants to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> clock and secure the victory, 13–10.|$|E
