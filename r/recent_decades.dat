40|$|The {{economy of}} Japan has been {{maturing}} {{in the beginning}} of the 21 st century. However, the decrease of population, birth rate, and increase of the aging population are proceeding rapidly especially in local cities. As a result, it will become difficult to maintain functions of communities in the future, and it is also forecasted that regional gaps between cities and villages will become large. Being based on regional characteristics, strengthening a wide area in self-sufficiency and exchanges among regions might be called for. This study aims at clarifying the changes of regional characteristics and exchanges among the regions in the Fukuoka wide area, using statistical data and personal trip survey data over the <b>recent</b> <b>decade,</b> paying attention to a new structure of a wide area including cities and villages. As a result, in the Fukuoka wide area, it was made clear that there were six groups which were classified with principal component analysis and cluster analysis, and they have spread concentrically, and become complicated in the <b>recent</b> <b>decade.</b> It might have been influenced by the changes of population distribution and household composition. Moreover, the exchanges among the regions have been broadened in the <b>recent</b> <b>decade.</b> In the Fukuoka wide area,strengthening both self-sufficiency and exchanges among the regions will become important subjects in future...|$|R

We therefore recommend public funding of large-scale sports facilities to be made conditional on a comprehensive urban design strategy that maximizes the external benefits. ...|$|R

5|$|Biologically active {{mushroom}} polysaccharides {{have been}} a frequent research topic in <b>recent</b> <b>decades</b> due to their possible stimulatory effect on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, antioxidant activity, cholesterol-lowering, and blood sugar-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of R.virescens fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water-insoluble beta-glucan, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have antitumor activities against sarcoma tumor cell lines. RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of galactomannan subunits and has antioxidant activity.|$|E
