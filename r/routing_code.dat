The machine then used the same typed route to set up a series of mechanical switches in the mechanism and then moved the mail to the proper bin, often at a long distance from the sorter. In theory, the machine could be expanded to any number of bins, but the majority had either 250 or 300.|$|E

50|$|The {{existing}} {{telephone exchanges}} and central offices became the local exchange {{points in the}} nationwide system, and each was assigned a number of three digits, which was unique in the Numbering Plan Area, but of similar form to all others. These codes served as destination <b>routing</b> <b>codes</b> for use by operators and subscribers to reach any central office through the switching network.|$|R

50|$|In the United States and Canada, area codes {{were first}} {{allocated}} in 1947. Some large cities used them soon after as operator <b>routing</b> <b>codes</b> for connecting long-distance telephone calls between toll switching centers. The first customer-dialed long-distance calls were possible in Englewood, NJ in 1951. By ca. 1966, {{the system was}} implemented fully in both countries and users of the telephone system needed to learn their own area code.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} the {{original}} set of 86 three-digit <b>routing</b> <b>codes</b> was implemented for operator-assisted long-distance calling in Canada and the US (Bell System, in 1947) the Newfoundland telephone system was entirely manual. Dial telephones came to St. John's in 1948; confederation with the Dominion of Canada was enacted in 1949. Canada's Atlantic provinces were originally area code 902, which remains in use throughout Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.|$|R

The routing discovery procedure of NAER includes six phases: (1) Route request, (2) Route reply, (3) Coding opportunity calculation, (4) <b>Coding</b> reply, (5) <b>Routing</b> and <b>coding</b> confirm, and (6) <b>Routing</b> and <b>coding</b> reply.|$|R
50|$|Not all NPAs had all functions. As some NPAs {{contained}} multiple cities, {{an additional}} <b>routing</b> <b>code</b> was sometimes placed after the area code.

50|$|The North American Numbering Plan is {{a closed}} {{numbering}} plan, that prescribes ten digits for each complete destination <b>routing</b> <b>code,</b> including a three-digit area code {{followed by a}} three-digit exchange and then four more digits. Other countries with open numbering plans use variable-length numbers; in some, such as Finland, subscriber numbers may vary in length even within an exchange.|$|E
50|$|As {{knowledge}} of phreaking spread, a minor culture {{emerged from the}} increasing number of phone phreaks. Sympathetic (or easily social-engineered) telephone company employees were persuaded to reveal the various <b>routing</b> <b>codes</b> to use international satellites and trunk lines. At the time it was felt that there was nothing Bell could do to stop this. Their entire network was based on this system, so changing the system in order to stop the phreakers would require a massive infrastructure upgrade.|$|R

50|$|The initial 86 area codes were {{assigned}} in 1947 as <b>routing</b> <b>codes</b> for operator calls; the first cross-country Bell System direct distance dial call {{was made in}} 1951. The system was based on fixed-length numbers; a direct-dial long distance call consisted of a three-digit area code and a seven-digit local number. Numbers in 2L+4N cities (such as Montréal and Toronto) were systematically lengthened to seven digits in the 1950's, a few exchanges at a time, so that all local numbers were seven digits when direct distance dialling finally came to town.|$|R

50|$|Mail {{was first}} sized to remove {{non-standard}} packages, and then fed onto a long conveyor belt {{running from the}} ground floor up to the sorting stations on the top. The sorting stations would extract letters from the belt and place them {{at the back of}} a large queue of letters that for each of the operators. The operators were presented with letters one at a time {{at the front of the}} queue, and selected a two-letter <b>routing</b> <b>code</b> from memory.|$|E
50|$|From {{the mid-1970s}} {{and in the}} 1980s, {{general-purpose}} mini-computers served as routers. Modern high-speed routers are highly specialized computers with extra hardware added to speed both common routing functions, such as packet forwarding, and specialised functions such as IPsec encryption. There is substantial use of Linux and Unix software based machines, running open source <b>routing</b> <b>code,</b> for research and other applications. The Cisco IOS operating system was independently designed. Major router operating systems, such as Junos and NX-OS, are extensively modified versions of Unix software.|$|E

This work builds on the back-pressure approach introduced by Tassiulas et al., extending it to network coding and correlated sources. In the proposed algorithms, decisions on <b>routing,</b> network <b>coding,</b> and scheduling between different sessions at a node are made locally at each node based on virtual queues for different sinks.

Thus, the message continue {{its way to the}} destination using unicast. The reader is referred to [16] for more details about <b>routing</b> <b>coded</b> messages in NC. The “Exist at dest.” flag, initially set to false, is updated by the routing nodes and set to true whenever a packet is received back within a coded message after being sent to its destination. For decodability purposes, the NC scheme guarantees that, in any coded message, at most one, packet is unknown by each destination.|$|R
50|$|Callers {{within a}} private {{numbering}} plan often dial a trunk prefix {{to reach a}} national or international destination (outside line) or to access a leased line (or tie-line) to another location within the same enterprise. A large manufacturer with factories and offices in multiple cities may use a prefix (such as '8') followed by an internal <b>routing</b> <b>code</b> to indicate a city or location, then an individual four- or five-digit extension number at the destination site. A common trunk prefix for an outside line on North American systems is the digit 9, followed by the outside destination number.|$|E
50|$|Many {{telephone}} numbering {{plans are}} structured based on divisions into geographic {{areas of the}} service territory. Each area identified in the plan is assigned a numeric <b>routing</b> <b>code.</b> This concept was first developed for Operator Toll Dialing of the Bell System in the early 1940s, which preceded the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) of 1947. The system divided the North American service territories into numbering plan areas (NPAs), and called the numerical prefix the numbering plan area code, which became known in a short-form as area code. The area code is prefixed to each telephone number assigned.|$|E
5000|$|Transorma {{machines}} had {{up to five}} stations where {{letters were}} presented {{one at a time}} to operators who read the address, selected a <b>routing</b> <b>code</b> that was typed onto the front of the letter, and then sent it off to be automatically sorted into one of up to 300 chutes. Several models were offered; the first U.S. postal station to install a Transorma system used the [...] "5/300" [...] model, which supported 5 sorters and 300 bins. Smaller models, like the [...] "1/150", were similar in concept but were operated by a single sorter and used and different mechanism for the sorting.|$|E

25|$|Before IBAN, differing {{national}} standards for bank account identification (i.e. bank, branch, <b>routing</b> <b>codes,</b> and account number) were confusing for some users. This often led to necessary routing information being missing from payments. Routing information as specified by ISO 9362 (also known as Business Identifier Codes (BIC code), SWIFT ID or SWIFT code, and SWIFT-BIC) {{does not require a}} specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. It also does not contain check digits, so errors of transcription were not detectable and it was not possible for a sending bank to validate the routing information prior to submitting the payment. Routing errors caused delayed payments and incurred extra costs to the sending and receiving banks and often to intermediate routing banks.|$|R
50|$|The E.164 {{standard}} of the International Telecommunications Union {{is an international}} numbering plan and establishes a country calling code (country code) for each member organization. Country codes are prefixes to national telephone numbers that denote call routing to the network of a subordinate number plan administration, typically a country, or group of countries with a uniform numbering plan, such as the NANP. E.164 permits a maximum length of 15 digits for the complete international phone number consisting of the country code, the national <b>routing</b> <b>code</b> (area code), and the subscriber number. E.164 does not define regional numbering plans, however, it does provide recommendations for new implementations and uniform representation of all telephone numbers.|$|E

50|$|Historically, some entire {{telephone}} exchanges in remote communities were reachable {{from the outside}} world only by shortwave radio. The initial international calls to the Dominion of Newfoundland were made on January 10, 1939 on a Canadian Marconi Company shortwave link through Montréal and required operator assistance even after local calls within St. John's switched to dial in 1948. A similar shortwave radio link joined St. John's to London UK, operated manually. While the original 86 area codes (created in 1947) provided a <b>routing</b> <b>code</b> for operators to dial Montréal (514) or Halifax (902) directly, the operator would have had to ask a Canadian operator to attempt to reach Newfoundland by radio until some time after the April Fools' Day 1949 confederation with Canada.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Multi-path routing is an {{important}} technique for reliable data forwarding in prone to failure wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which it leads to consume more energy. In this paper, we propose a new routing mechanism that combines multi-path <b>routing</b> with network <b>coding</b> (NCR). This combination decreases the number of required path and the total times of transmission in WSNs. In the proposed algorithm the number of control messages which exchange between nodes for route discovering, has been reduced. Simulation results show that NCR is an energy-efficient technique that improves the parameters of similar multi-path routing protocols.
