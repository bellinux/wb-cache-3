5|$|As David Halberstam {{put it in}} {{his book}} Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made,Michael Jordan and David Falk helped make each other, and each profited to a {{remarkable}} degree from their special collaboration. It is true that Michael Jordan was the person who in the end actually did the deeds, went on the court and hit the final jump shot again and again, but {{it is also true that}} David Falk helped <b>revolutionize</b> <b>the</b> process of representing a basketball player, going into a team sport and creating the idea of the individual player as a commercial superstar.|$|E
5|$|From the {{distance}} of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried to <b>revolutionize</b> <b>the</b> Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Point {{has had a}} {{cultural}} influence on American society as evidenced in many forms of media such as books, television, and film. In the 1940 biographical film Knute Rockne, All American documenting the life of famous Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, Cedar Point is featured at a pivotal point in the story. In 1913, Knute works as a lifeguard on a beach at Cedar Point, {{where he and his}} college roommate Gus Dorais worked on the forward pass. The concept, which was first used in a scrimmage game at Cedar Point, would <b>revolutionize</b> <b>the</b> sport and the film would later be preserved in the Library of Congress National Film Registry. In 2004, an independently-produced film, Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind: Infestation From Mars, was shot at several historic locations around Sandusky including Cedar Point. Dick Kinzel, CEO of Cedar Fair at the time, had a brief speaking role in the film.|$|E

25|$|Piaget {{wanted to}} <b>revolutionize</b> <b>the</b> way {{research}} was conducted. Although he started researching with his colleagues using a traditional method of data collection, {{he was not}} fully satisfied with the results and wanted to keep trying {{to find new ways}} of researching using a combination of data, which included naturalistic observation, psychometrics, and the psychiatric clinical examination, {{in order to have a}} less guided form of research that would produce more empirically valid results.|$|E

One should not neglect the poems of George Bacovia a symbolist poet of neurosis and despair and those of Ion Barbu a brilliant mathematician who wrote a series of very successful cryptic poems. Tristan Tzara and Marcel Janco, founders of the Dadaist movement, were also of Romanian origin.|$|E

The industry revolutionized home heating and lighting along the eastern seaboard. He held several patents on ice making machines, including his perfected “Compression Ice Machine” which would <b>revolutionize</b> <b>the</b> cold storage industry. He even discovered that gas burning through a platinum mantle produced a bright illumination (as later found in the Coleman lantern).|$|E
25|$|The main figure {{responsible}} {{for the birth of}} commutative algebra as a mature subject was Wolfgang Krull, who introduced the fundamental notions of localization and completion of a ring, {{as well as that of}} regular local rings. He established the concept of the Krull dimension of a ring, first for Noetherian rings before moving on to expand his theory to cover general valuation rings and Krull rings. To this day, Krull's principal ideal theorem is widely considered the single most important foundational theorem in commutative algebra. These results paved the way for the introduction of commutative algebra into algebraic geometry, an idea which would <b>revolutionize</b> <b>the</b> latter subject.|$|E
25|$|These {{developments}} {{meant that}} catchers {{began to take}} on a crucial defensive role, as a pitcher's deceptive deliveries could only be effective if the catcher was capable of fielding them. The progression of the catcher positioning himself closer to the plate would lead to changes in pitching deliveries that would <b>revolutionize</b> <b>the</b> sport. In the 1870s, pitcher Candy Cummings was able to introduce the curveball because his catcher, Nat Hicks, fielded his position in close proximity to home plate and was able to catch the deceptive pitch. Other specialized pitches such as the spitball and the knuckleball followed, which further emphasized the defensive importance of the catcher's position.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between New Bedford and Nantucket allowed {{the two cities}} to dominate the whaling industry. In 1848 New Bedford resident Lewis Temple invented the toggling harpoon, an invention that would <b>revolutionize</b> <b>the</b> whaling industry. This helped make New Bedford the preeminent city in the U.S. whaling industry. Another factor was the increased draft of whaling ships, in part the result of greater use of steel in their construction, which made them too deep for Nantucket harbor. Syren, the longest lived of the clipper ships, spent over a decade transporting whale oil and whaling products to New Bedford, principally from Honolulu, and was owned for several years by William H. Besse of New Bedford. As {{a result of its}} control over whaling products that were used widely throughout the world (most importantly whale oil), New Bedford became one of the richest per capita cities in the world.|$|E
25|$|In 1981 Zohar Zisapel {{resigned}} {{from his position}} at the Ministry of Defense and, together with Yehuda, founded RAD Data Communications Ltd. Operating from small, cramped quarters {{in the back of}} Bynet’s offices, Zohar oversaw the development of RAD’s first product, a miniature modem that would <b>revolutionize</b> <b>the</b> industry. The modems that were then on the market were the size of pizza boxes. RAD’s modem, however, could fit into one’s hand, and, remarkably, it did not require an independent power source, having been designed to operate instead by utilizing power flowing over the telephone line. One version of this modem, SRM-3, would be recognized by the Guinness Book of Records as the smallest ever manufactured. Within two years of its founding, RAD had become a profitable international manufacturer of access solutions for data communications and telecommunications applications. In 1987 the company had reached $10 million in annual sales. RAD won the Israel Export Prize in 1993, the year in which its sales first exceeded $50 million. It surpassed the $100 million mark in global sales in 1996.|$|E

500|$|Chris Roberts {{is highly}} {{regarded}} {{in the field}} of spaceflight combat simulators due to his successful Wing Commander franchise. [...] When the industry learned that he was creating a new spaceflight combat simulator, they paid close attention to it. [...] In its first public showing at E3 1999, Roberts's Freelancer won four Game Critics Awards, including Best Game of the Show. [...] Journalists at one of the game's later showings queued up to 90minutes {{to catch a glimpse of}} a half-hour demonstration. [...] Computer Gaming World, trusting Roberts's vision, named Freelancer as a game that would <b>revolutionize</b> <b>the</b> gaming industry. [...] Shortly after the game was released, IGN called it the Game of the Month. [...] Early in the game's development, the industry was enthusiastic about the prospect of playing in a world that changes without player interaction (a dynamic world), although there was caution over the possibility of such implementation with contemporary technology. [...] Delays in the schedule and Microsoft's take over of Digital Anvil gave rise to speculation that Roberts's most promised featurethe dynamic worldwould be cut.|$|E
500|$|When they smuggle {{her back}} into the factory {{disguised}} as a baby monster in an attempt to send her home, Randall discovers her and tries to kidnap her, but he mistakenly kidnaps Mike instead. He straps Mike to a large machine called [...] "The Scream Extractor," [...] which he intends to use to <b>revolutionize</b> <b>the</b> scaring industry and solve the monster world's energy problems by forcefully extracting screams from kidnapped human children. Before Randall can use the machine on Mike, Sulley intervenes and reports Randall to Waternoose. Waternoose, secretly in league with Randall, instead exiles Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas. The two are taken in by a Yeti, who tells them about a nearby village which Sulley realizes he can use to return to the factory. Sulley prepares to leave, but Mike refuses to go with him. Meanwhile, Randall is preparing to use the Scream Extractor on Boo, but Sulley arrives and saves her. Randall and Sulley fight, and after Mike returns and the two reconcile, they overpower Randall, take Boo, and flee.|$|E
