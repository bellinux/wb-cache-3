25|$|The French {{food safety}} agency was {{concerned}} about taurine. A Red Bull drink that did not contain taurine was introduced. The French <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> market <b>approval</b> was challenged by the European Commission, and partially upheld by the European Court of Justice in 2004. The French food safety agency relented in 2008, because it was unable to prove a definite health risk, taurine-related or not.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{conspiracy}} in 1478 to depose the family by killing Lorenzo with his younger brother Giuliano during Easter services; the assassination attempt ended {{with the death of}} Giuliano and an injured Lorenzo. The conspiracy involved the Pazzi and Salviati families, who were both rival banking families seeking to end the Medici influence, as well as the priest presiding over the church services, the Archbishop of Pisa, and even Pope Sixtus IV to a degree. The conspirators approached Sixtus IV in the hopes <b>of</b> gaining his <b>approval,</b> as he and the Medici had a long rivalry themselves, but the pope gave no official sanction to the plan. Despite his <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> official <b>approval,</b> the pope nonetheless allowed the plot to proceed without interfering, and, after the failed assassination of Lorenzo, also gave dispensation for crimes done {{in the service of the}} church. After this, Lorenzo adopted his brother's illegitimate son, Giulio de' Medici (1478-1535), the future Clement VII. Unfortunately, all of Lorenzo's careful planning fell apart to some degree under his incompetent son, Piero II, who took over as the head of Florence after his father's death. Piero was responsible for the expulsion of the Medici from 1494-1512.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Community-based {{interventions}} using artemisinin-derived suppositories may potentially reduce malaria-related childhood mortality. However, their sociocultural acceptability {{is unknown}} in Papua New Guinea and a formal examination of caregiver’s attitudes to rectal administration {{was needed to}} inform effective deployment strategies. Caregivers (n 131) of children with uncomplicated malaria were questioned on their prior experience with, and attitudes to, rectal administration and then offered artesunate suppositories as treatment of their child. The 29 % who refused this alternative were further questioned to determine their reasons for this <b>refusal.</b> Lack <b>of</b> spousal <b>approval</b> and fear <b>of</b> side effects were the most common reasons for <b>refusal.</b> Sixty-six percent <b>of</b> caregivers agreed to self-administer suppositories, which were perceived as effective (99 %), safe (96 %), and fast-acting (91 %), but problematic to administer to a struggling child (56 %). Shame, embarrassment, and hygiene were not significant concerns. Acceptability of rectal administration should be relatively high in Papua New Guinea. However, deployment {{must be accompanied by}} health education that addresses the practical aspects of administration, is appropriate for the illiterate, and is directed at fathers as well as mothers...|$|R
