2500|$|Promotion to {{the rank}} of {{sergeant}} and beyond is achieved by way of a [...] "merit based" [...] promotion system, whereby officers undertake a series of [...] "pre-qualification assessments" [...] and are placed on a ranked list before gaining promotion. Officers who qualify for a promotion list are given an eligibility mark and are ranked according to order of merit from the highest mark to the lowest. This means that the highest-ranked member on the promotions list will be considered first for the rank and position concerned. Members seeking placement on a promotion list must have spent the requisite time at the rank below, which is at least two years, and must have successfully completed the relevant pre-qualifying assessment examinations, an applicant evaluation and must meet the eligibility program. [...] A new promotion list for each rank or grade is prepared each year, and an applicant who does not accept promotion can remain on a list only for three years before having to <b>requalify</b> for the list.|$|E
2500|$|If a New South Wales Police Force officer elects to {{undertake}} criminal investigation duties, {{after a period}} of exams and assignments, and given experience in a criminal investigation office that officer is given the designation of [...] "detective". As it is a designation and not a rank, the designation comes prior to the rank, i.e. detective constable, or detective senior constable etc. Returning to general duties (uniform) is common for detectives, and many detectives do seek promotion in the general duties arena. However, while they do not lose their detective's designation if they leave full-time investigation duties, it is customary not to use their designation while performing general or other duties which are not an authorised investigative position. On returning to an authorised position they can use their designation again without having to <b>requalify.</b> There has been some consideration given by the police force in recent years to identify designated detectives performing uniform duties by way of a distinctive badge or uniform embellishment, but this has not been adopted.|$|E
