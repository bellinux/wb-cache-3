25|$|Pre-set hybrid {{triggers}} {{are similar}} to a DA/SA trigger in reverse. The first pull of the trigger is pre-set. If the striker or hammer fail to discharge the cartridge, the trigger may be pulled again and will operate as a double-action only (DAO) until the cartridge discharges or the malfunction is cleared. This allows the operator to attempt a second time to fire a cartridge after a misfire malfunction, {{as opposed to a}} single-action, in which the only thing to do if a round fails to fire is to rack the slide, clearing the round and <b>recocking</b> the hammer. While this can be advantageous in that many rounds will fire on being struck a second time, and it is faster to pull the trigger a second time than to cycle the action, if the round fails to fire on the second strike, the user will be forced to clear the round anyway, thus using up even more time than if they had simply done so in the first place. The Taurus PT 24/7 Pro pistol (not {{to be confused with the}} first-generation 24/7 which was a traditional pre-set) offered this feature starting in 2006. The Walther P99 Anti-Stress is another example.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't know? very well," [...] said Lindsay, <b>recocking</b> the pistol, {{and placing}} the cold muzzle of {{it against the}} Arab's yellow nose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quickly <b>recocking</b> his pistol, Kaldhein {{raised it}} again. I involuntarily shrank back, expecting death; {{but before he}} could fire his arm {{suddenly}} dropped, and the pistol was discharged into the ground. Then began a strange scene. The man shouted, kicked, and beat up and down with his arms; his pistol fell from his hand, he sprang from side to side, he turned around, he struggled and yelled.|$|E
5000|$|Winchester Model 55: An {{unconventional}} {{hybrid of}} a single-shot and a semi-automatic, this [...]22-caliber rifle ejected the fired case and <b>recocked</b> itself like a conventional blowback-operated self-loader, but it lacked {{a magazine and}} had to be manually reloaded for each shot.|$|R
50|$|Figure 3: After the {{required}} amount of exposure the second shutter curtain {{moves to the}} left to cover the frame aperture. When the shutter is <b>recocked</b> the shutter curtains are wound back to the right hand side {{ready for the next}} exposure.|$|R
50|$|Figure 4: The first {{shutter curtain}} {{finishes}} moving, {{followed closely by}} the second curtain which is now covering the frame aperture completely. When the shutter is <b>recocked</b> both shutter curtains are wound back to the right hand side {{ready for the next}} exposure.|$|R
5000|$|Players {{experienced}} in both working on and operating Autocockers prefer a more careful timing process called suction, or vacuum timing. The <b>recocking</b> cycle is carefully moved closer towards the firing point, until {{the interaction between}} the ball exiting the barrel and the bolt <b>recocking</b> creates a vacuum in the breech. This causes the marker to effectively [...] "suck" [...] a paintball into the chamber.|$|E
50|$|This {{problem is}} {{exacerbated}} when using a fully electronic marker. Most mechanical markers use a blowback system for <b>recocking,</b> or other methods where a large reciprocating mass is involved. This will shake the {{balls in the}} hopper slightly, facilitating gravity feed. A marker with both electronically controlled <b>recocking</b> and firing may exhibit no shake whatsoever while operating. Because of this, small packs in the hopper are not broken up and feeding problems result.|$|E
50|$|The shift {{method has}} been used with cameras such as the Stereo Realist to take hypers, either by taking two pairs and {{selecting}} the best frames, or by alternately capping each lens and <b>recocking</b> the shutter.|$|E
50|$|The BT-4 Combat is a poppet valve, blow-back marker; {{the bolt}} slides forward {{to open the}} valve, and air {{released}} from the valve propels the paintball forward and <b>recocks</b> the bolt for another shot. The stock BT-4 Combat includes adjustable handgrip and rear sight, sliding feedneck, and 8 inch barrel.|$|R
60|$|Taking a {{very long}} and {{deliberate}} aim at the bear's heart, he pulled the trigger, but the faithless lock of his old flint-gun missed fire. Without a sign of annoyance or agitation, the trapper <b>recocked</b> the gun, again pulled the trigger, and with the same result. Three times this occurred, and at each click of the lock the bear cocked his ears inquiringly. The third time, he rose and sauntered slowly towards {{the spot where the}} men lay concealed.|$|R
5000|$|A repeating rifle is a single-barreled rifle {{containing}} multiple {{rounds of}} ammunition which are loaded into the gun's chamber from a magazine by means of either a manual or automatic mechanism, and the act of loading the rifle typically also <b>recocks</b> the firing action. In common usage, the term [...] "repeating rifle" [...] is most often applied specifically to weapons in which the next cartridge is loaded by a manual action, as opposed to self-loading rifles, in which the recoil of one shot is used to cycle the action and load the next round.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in {{the late}} 1980s, the GIAT 30 is a {{revolver}} cannon with electric ignition and automatic <b>recocking.</b> Unlike the DEFA cannon, the revolver chamber is electrically operated, rather than gas operated, improving both reliability and rate of fire.|$|E
50|$|Some pump action paintball markers {{such as the}} Sterling {{and many}} Nelson-based markers like the PMI Tracer and CCI Phantom offer slam-fire action, also known as an auto-trigger, which occurs when the trigger is {{squeezed}} and the marker fires with every ensuing <b>recocking</b> of the marker via the pump.|$|E
50|$|Other tracheotomes such as {{the spring}} {{operated}} tracheotome designed by Adamson Howard in 1985, Florida, improved the design by reducing the size and including a rotatable adjustable cap at the mount of the tracheotome to control the depth of penetration in the incision. Its handle also allowed the <b>recocking</b> of the spring operated cutting blade.|$|E
50|$|At dawn on Sunday, September 6, Walker and Marmaduke {{squared off}} with Colt Navy revolvers {{on the north}} bank of the Arkansas River near Little Rock. Both fired and missed. Marmaduke then <b>recocked</b> and fired a second time, mortally {{wounding}} Walker in the right side, just above the beltline. Walker forgave Marmaduke when the latter offered his assistance. As General Walker lay dying, his wife rode from St. Francis to Little Rock, and gave birth to their son, Lucius Marshall Walker, Jr.Lucius M. Walker died at 5 p.m. the next day. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of types of rifles and {{shotguns}} based on the method they are reloaded. Bolt-action and lever-action rifles are manually operated. Manipulation of the bolt or the lever causes the spent cartridge to be removed, the firing mechanism <b>recocked,</b> and a fresh cartridge inserted. These two types of action are almost exclusively used by rifles. Slide-action (commonly called 'pump-action') rifles and shotguns are manually cycled by shuttling the foregrip of the firearm back and forth. This type of action is typically used by shotguns, but several major manufacturers make rifles that use this action.|$|R
50|$|The 553 was {{superseded}} by the DEFA 554, which incorporates {{a number of}} detail improvements. The DEFA 554 uses three, rather than two, of the chambers for reloading, increasing rate of fire. Barrel life and mechanical reliability are improved, and an electrical control unit now allows the pilot to select two rates of fire: 1,800 rounds per minute for air-to-air use or 1,200 rounds per minute for air-to-ground attacks. The 554 also provides three pyrotechnic cartridges rather than one, allowing the pilot to cock the weapon only after take-off while still having two cartridges to <b>recock</b> in flight.|$|R
50|$|Poppet valves {{are easy}} to replace and require little maintenance. The {{downside}} to this design, however, is its high operating pressure, {{which leads to a}} larger recoil and less accuracy. Some markers have a separate firing and <b>recocking</b> sequence, which decreases the recoil caused by the cycling of the hammer. Markers with a hammer have a firing delay when compared to a full electropneumatic.|$|E
5000|$|Over the {{duration}} of the war the two-inch mortar was developed into eight separate marks, from which also stemmed a number of other variations. Some were successful and others less so; one of the latter, the [...] "Weston" [...] version, was developed in 1944, but was found to be less than satisfactory when used on soft ground. This weapon had the advantage of being fitted with an automatic <b>recocking</b> feature of the firing mechanism, but despite this it was withdrawn from use.|$|E
5000|$|Short-Stroking: On {{mechanical}} Autocockers, {{the trigger}} both fires the marker (by releasing the sear) and re-cocks it (by pulling the timing rod and activating the 3-way). The {{pull of the}} trigger accomplishes first one, then the other, in a precisely timed operation, making it necessary for the player to fully pull and release the trigger each time. Only partially pulling the trigger, known colloquially as [...] "short-stroking", will alter the duration of time the pneumatics are actively operating the <b>recocking</b> mechanism, or may eliminate the re-cocking cycle altogether. Short-stroking can thus cause many malfunctions related {{to one or more}} steps of the <b>recocking</b> process not being performed. For instance, if the back block does not move fully rearward, the hammer may not be caught by the sear, and will be released into the pin valve immediately upon the back block moving forward again. If the back block is not kept rearward long enough for a paintball to drop fully into the chamber, a [...] "dry fire" [...] or a [...] "ball chop" [...] may occur, the latter being extremely frustrating as it drastically affects accuracy of future shots until the barrel, breech and bolt are cleaned. The need for a full trigger pull on mechanical Autocockers also results in a slower rate of fire.|$|E
5000|$|The Flak 18 {{was mounted}} on a {{cruciform}} gun carriage. A simple-to-operate [...] "semi-automatic" [...] loading system ejected fired shells, allowing it to be reloaded by simply inserting a new shell into a tray. The gun would then fire, recoil, and, during the return stroke, the empty case would be thrown backward by levers, a cam would then engage and <b>recock</b> the gun. This resulted in firing rates of 15 to 20 rounds a minute, which was better than similar weapons of the era. High explosive ammunition was used against aircraft and personnel, andarmour-piercing and high-explosive anti-tank against tanks and other armored vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|With its slim-contour [...] barrel, {{the rifle}} was {{slightly}} muzzle heavy. [...] With practice {{it could be}} rapidly fired, <b>recocked,</b> and reloaded without taking the rifle from the shoulder. [...] Contemporary reports and subsequent tests indicate that the M1895 and its ammunition were exceedingly accurate: target groups approaching a minute of angle at 100 yards were not unusual with individual rifles. [...] The M1895 was normally issued with a sling, bandoliers, and a modern 8.18-inch (208mm) knife-type bayonet. [...] Individual sailors and marines were issued a black leather belt with adjustable cross suspenders, fitted with twelve black leather ammunition pouches. The Lee Navy bayonet was the forerunner of short pattern bayonets still in use today.|$|R
50|$|Contrasting {{this move}} toward {{high rates of}} fire, {{there is also a}} strong {{following}} of stock-class paintball games, where players use older, purely mechanical pump-action marker designs to purposefully limit rate of fire. Pump markers require the player to <b>recock</b> the marker, using a pump handle similar to a pump-action shotgun, before each shot. Stock-class games and competitions require the use of pump markers, and also often limit the types and capacities of propellant sources and loading mechanisms that players may use. With the decreased rate of fire and carrying capacity, increased need for reloads of both paintballs and propellant, and the generally quieter report of these markers, stock-class play places more emphasis on accuracy, stealth, and tactics.|$|R
50|$|Modern 9 mm magazines, such {{as those}} used by the Sterling SMG, are curved and feed both sides to avoid this problem. If a Sten failed to feed due to jammed {{cartridges}} in the magazine, standard practice to clear it was as follows: remove magazine from Sten, tap {{the base of the}} magazine against the knee, re-insert magazine in Sten, then <b>recocking</b> the weapon and firing again as normal. To facilitate easier loading when attempting to push the cartridges down to insert the next one, a magazine filler tool was developed and formed part of the weapon's kit.|$|E
50|$|An inline {{blowback}} {{is a type}} of blowback design. A blowback marker is {{one that}} when the trigger is pulled, the sear is released, which allows the striker, which is linked to the bolt, to slam into the valve, which releases air into the bolt, which is redirected out the barrel. The valve also releases air back into the striker, pushing it back and <b>recocking</b> the marker. An inline blowback is where the bolt, striker, and valve are all adjacent horizontally in the same tube, instead of in a stacked tube blowback where the valve and striker are in one tube, and the bolt is in another tube above the valve and striker.|$|E
5000|$|In {{mechanical}} designs, {{the trigger}} manipulates a sear, which {{is holding a}} hammer, ram, or sealed gas chamber in its resting state. Pulling the trigger releases the sear, allowing the marker's action to cycle. There {{are a variety of}} mechanical designs, the most common being the [...] "blow-back" [...] marker, which utilizes a spring-loaded ram released by the sear to open a pin valve; the pressurized gas released through the valve is directed through the bolt to fire the marker, and also pushes the ram back where it is caught again by the sear, resetting the action for the next shot. There are other systems that saw success in earlier days of the sport, such as blow-forward (AGD Automag) and pneumatically actuated <b>recocking</b> (WorrGames Autococker); elements of these designs were carried forward into modern electropneumatic designs but the original examples of these mechanisms are rarely seen today.|$|E
5000|$|With its slim-contour 28 in barrel, {{the rifle}} was {{slightly}} muzzle heavy. With practice {{it could be}} rapidly fired, <b>recocked,</b> and reloaded without taking the rifle from the shoulder. Contemporary reports and subsequent tests indicate that the M1895 and its ammunition were exceedingly accurate: target groups approaching a minute of angle at 100 yards were not unusual with individual rifles. [...] The M1895 was normally issued with a sling, bandoliers, and a modern 8.18-inch (208mm) knife-type bayonet. Individual sailors and marines were issued a black leather belt with adjustable cross suspenders, fitted with twelve black leather ammunition pouches. The Lee Navy bayonet was the forerunner of short pattern bayonets still in use today.|$|R
50|$|The rotary shutter and {{the film}} drive are like those used in cine cameras. When the shutter release is pressed, a light-blocking shield lifts and the shutter disc rotates a full turn exposing the film through its open sector; when the {{pressure}} is released the light-blocking shield returns to its position behind the lens, and the spring motor advances the film and <b>recocks</b> the shutter. This is almost instantaneous. With practice a photographer could take 4 or 5 pictures a second. Each winding of the spring motor was good for about 25 pictures, half a roll of film. Shutter speed was determined by spring tension and mechanical delay since the exposure sector was fixed. The Robot I had an exposure range of 1 to 1/500, and provision for time exposures.|$|R
2500|$|While many European {{and some}} American revolvers were {{designed}} as double-action models throughout the late 19th century, {{for the first}} half of the 20th century, all semi-automatics were single-action weapons, requiring the weapon to be carried cocked with the safety on, or with an empty chamber (Colt M1911, Mauser C96, Luger P.08, Tokarev TT, Browning Hi-Power). The difference between these weapons and single-action revolvers is that while a single-action revolver requires the user to manually cock the hammer before firing, a single-action semi-automatic is automatically cocked when the user cycles the slide to chamber a round. Thereafter, every time a round is fired, the hammer is <b>recocked</b> by the cycling slide, and is thus always cocked unless the user manually lowers the hammer, or pulls the trigger on an empty chamber (weapons lacking automatic-hold-open feature only).|$|R
50|$|Unlike other {{electropneumatic}} {{spool valve}} markers on the market, which use a solenoid valve to actuate {{the movement of}} the bolt, the SLG operates using a spool valve actuated by a mechanical solenoid and sear. This unique single-tube, sear-tripping, blow-forward operation is comparable to, though not identical to, the operation of the Automag. In the SLG, the <b>recocking</b> mechanism is air pressure acting on a smaller, forward-facing area to push the bolt back open when the pressure in the dump chamber—which acts on a larger, rearward-facing area—reaches a low pressure from firing and venting the dump chamber. In the Automag, this is accomplished by the return spring. If the sear is tripped but the dump chamber is not vented due to the bolt failing to close, the bleed button on the back cap can be depressed, which vents the dump to the outside through the back cap, thus allowing the bolt to recock.|$|E
5000|$|Sear Trip: Even with an {{electronic}} trigger, the Autococker still relies on a hammer and spring valve for firing. The electronic trigger controls the <b>recocking</b> pneumatics, and a sear solenoid. Thus, even electronic Autocockers have an amount of recoil and rate of fire some find unacceptable for serious play (though Autocockers are still seen in serious tournament play). In early 2006, the first fully electronic (valve and recock) electronic Autocockers were seen, made using the [...] "mQ valve" [...] (named after their inventor Mike Quinn). The valve only had a limited release cycle however, and became tied up in production and legal issues. A lack of steady supply of mQ valves caused prices to skyrocket on eBay, even for used or damaged ones. In mid-2007, the original creators announced that they had resolved the production issues and are now making new [...] "mQ2 valves," [...] which are mQ valves redesigned for greater reliability, flow, and consistency.|$|E
5000|$|Though Webley viewed this weapon as {{an ideal}} sidearm for cavalry troops, the Webley-Fosbery was never adopted as an {{official}} government sidearm. At over 11 inches long and weighing some 44 ounces (1239 grammes) unloaded, the Webley-Fosbery was a heavy and unwieldy sidearm even {{by the standards of}} the day. Several models of Webley-Fosbery revolvers were produced, and the type saw limited action in the Boer Wars as well as World War I, where some privately purchased examples were carried by British officers in the [...]455 service chambering. Reports from the field suggested that the Webley-Fosbery, with its precisely machined recoil surfaces, was more susceptible to jamming in wartime conditions of mud and rain than comparable sidearms of the period. It has been commonly alleged that the Webley-Fosbery required a tight hold in order for the cylinder to properly cycle and cock the weapon. Another disadvantage was manual <b>recocking.</b> Unlike the simple technique used for ordinary revolvers, the Webley-Fosbery requires pulling the entire action-cylinder-barrel assembly back across the frame, a two-handed operation.|$|E
5000|$|The cyclic rate {{reflects}} {{how fast}} a self-loading firearm can fire, extract, reload, and <b>recock</b> its mechanism {{to prepare for}} follow-up shots. This is not, however, the effective rate of fire. The effective rate of fire is {{the rate at which}} shots can be accurately (effectively) fired at a specific point target. Many firearms have been developed with high rates of fire which have proven to have extremely low rates of effective fire. An easy example of this is the MAC-10 [...] submachine gun. The MAC-10 in 9mm originally fired at 1,200 rpm. At this rate individual shots can no longer be heard so its fire sounds like a giant zipper being ripped apart. When a MAC-10 fires, the probability of hitting a target with more than 1 or 2 rounds is quite low. So it has a very poor effective rate of fire.|$|R
50|$|The Browning Hi-Power BDA is a {{semi-automatic}} short recoil operated locked breech firearm. It has a vertically tilting delayed camming action. This {{locking mechanism}} was {{borrowed from the}} Browning Hi-Power. The handgun features a double-action trigger which cocks and then releases the hammer. The recoil of the slide <b>recocks</b> the hammer, and all consecutive shots are fired from the single-action mode. A disconnector ensures the pistol fires in semi-automatic mode only. The spring-loaded external claw extractor is mounted in the slide, while the fixed ejector - inside the pistol’s frame. The BDA is secured against unintentional firing with an automatic firing pin safety which blocks the firing pin and is released only when the trigger is pulled to fire. Immediately after a round is fired, the safety reengages itself even if the trigger is not released. The BDA also has a decocking safety that safely releases and captures the hammer in a safety notch. A decocking lever is mounted {{on each side of}} the pistol’s frame.|$|R
50|$|In late 1986, Bud Orr {{created the}} {{original}} Sniper pump marker by carving {{the works of}} a standard Sheridan PGP into an aluminum block that would accept a longer barrel. The Sniper was operated {{in a manner similar}} to pump-action shotguns in that it had to be manually <b>recocked</b> after each shot to load the next round. In 1987, Orr founded Worr Game Products to sell the products he was developing, and by 1988 he was running the business full-time. In order to stay competitive with the rising popularity of semiautomatic markers in the late 1980s, Orr added a pneumatic system onto the Sniper. The pneumatics automatically re-cocked the marker after each shot, and in 1989 the Autococker was born. There is a lot of controversy as to whether the design was stolen from Glenn Palmer (who has repeatedly and publicly made and defended this claim and has given a detailed accounting of the circumstances) or was actually Bud's innovation.|$|R
