40|$|AIM—Quantification of haemodynamics of the peripapillary choroid {{in and the}} {{assessment}} of possible differences between normal subjects (N), ocular hypertensive (OHT), primary open angle (POAG), and normal pressure glaucoma (NPG) patients.  METHODS—Video fluorescein angiograms (Rodenstock SLO 101) were made in 22  N subjects, 12  OHT, 48  POAG, and 46  NPG patients. The angiographically derived dye build up curves were described {{by means of an}} exponential model. One of the model parameters is the time constant τ theoretically reflecting local blood refreshment time; the blood <b>refreshment</b> <b>time</b> τ is the time needed to replace the blood volume in the choriocapillaris, inversely proportional to the local choroidal blood flow. Other variables are maximal fluorescence (Fdt) and time of first fluorescence (t 0). Mean variable values were calculated for disc area and circular areas around the disc.  RESULTS—Fdt of the disc was significantly lower in the POAG and NPG patients. There was no statistical difference in t 0 between the study groups. The choroidal blood <b>refreshment</b> <b>time</b> was significantly longer in NPG patients {{and to a lesser extent}} in the POAG patients compared with the normal controls. The slowest choroidal blood refreshment can be found in the NPG group. The median choroidal blood refreshment times (25 th- 75 th percentile) in the controls, OHT, POAG, and NPG patients were 4. 1  (3. 7 - 4. 5), 4. 4  (3. 7 - 6. 4), 5. 8  (4. 3 - 6. 8), and 7. 1  (5. 5 - 9. 3) seconds respectively.  CONCLUSIONS—With the help of parametrisation of dye curves, using a one compartmental model, choroidal haemodynamics can be quantified. The blood <b>refreshment</b> <b>time</b> of the peripapillary choriocapillaris was found to be significantly prolonged especially in NPG patients; this may indicate slower choroidal haemodynamics in NPG patients. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{demonstrate}} the hypothetical model based on structural relationship with the occupational dysfunction on psychological problems (stress response, burnout syndrome, and depression) in healthcare workers. Method. Three cross sectional studies were conducted to assess the following relations: (1) occupational dysfunction on stress response (n = 468), (2) occupational dysfunction on burnout syndrome (n = 1, 142), and (3) occupational dysfunction on depression (n = 687). Personal characteristics were collected through a questionnaire (such as age, gender, and job category, opportunities for <b>refreshment,</b> <b>time</b> spent on leisure activities, and work relationships) as well as the Classification and Assessment of Occupational Dysfunction (CAOD). Furthermore, study 1 included the Stress Response Scale- 18 (SRS- 18), study 2 used the Japanese Burnout Scale (JBS), and study 3 employed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and path analysis of structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis were used in all of the studies. EFA and CFA were used to measure structural validity of four assessments; CAOD, SRS- 18, JBS, and CES-D. For examination of a potential covariate, we assessed the correlation of the total and factor score of CAOD and personal factors in all studies. Moreover, direct and indirect effects of occupational dysfunction on stress response (Study 1), burnout syndrome (Study 2), and depression (Study 3) were also analyzed. Results. In study 1, CAOD had 16 items and 4 factors. In Study 2 and 3, CAOD had 16 items and 5 factors. SRS- 18 had 18 items and 3 factors, JBS had 17 items and 3 factors, and CES-D had 20 items and 4 factors. All studies found that there were significant correlations between the CAOD total score and the personal factor that included opportunities for <b>refreshment,</b> <b>time</b> spent on leisure activities, and work relationships (p < 0. 01). The hypothesis model results suggest that the classification of occupational dysfunction had good fit on the stress response (RMSEA = 0. 061, CFI = 0. 947, and TLI = 0. 943), burnout syndrome (RMSEA = 0. 076, CFI = 0. 919, and TLI = 0. 913), and depression (RMSEA = 0. 060, CFI = 0. 922, TLI = 0. 917). Moreover, the detected covariates include opportunities for <b>refreshment,</b> <b>time</b> spent on leisure activities, and work relationships on occupational dysfunction. Conclusion. Our findings indicate that psychological problems are associated with occupational dysfunction in healthcare workers. Reduction of occupational dysfunction might be a strategy of better preventive occupational therapies for healthcare workers with psychological problems.

40|$|Using the {{archives}} of the American Association of Variable Stars Observers and our own data, we analyse the long-term variability of several well-studied Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) aiming on a general picture of stochastic variability of these objects. The power density spectra of all the selected objects may be generally described by a single power law contaminated by observational noise at higher frequencies. The slopes of the power-law com-ponent are close to p = 2 (where PDS ∝ f−p, and f is frequency) for strongly variable flaring objects like AG Car and significantly smaller (p ∼ 1. 3) for P Cyg where brightness variation amplitude is. 1 m and dominated by slow low-amplitude variability. The slope holds for about two orders of magni-tude in the frequency domain, though peaks and curvatures are present at f ' 10 − 2 ÷ 10 − 3 d− 1. We show that pseudo-photosphere approach to variabil-ity may explain the power-law shape of the variability spectrum at higher frequencies. However, the observed spectra are actually rather “red ” than “brown”: flux variations are correlated up to tens of years that is much longer than the characteristic <b>refreshment</b> <b>time</b> scales of the pseudo-photosphere. We propose that several stochastic noise components produce the power spec-tra of LBVs...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} develop a high {{efficient}} drying system for agricultural products, some fundamental experiments for generating air at normal temperature and under lower humidity were performed. Considerations were paid about a practical combination of solid absorbent and heat pump dehumidifying methods. The efficiency of absorption and the moisture absorption for each method were investigated under practical applications. The results obtained can be summarized as follows : 1. In case of air ventilation with high humidity, the efficiency of absorption of desiccant silica gel decreased rapidly at more than 35 % (d. b.) moisture content. 2. Judging from the analysis of absorption water of desiccant silica gel, relationship between limit absorption time T (h) and thickness of sedimentary layer Xn (n : tray number) was shown as follows. T= 0. 75 + 0. 725 Xn 3. Change of absorption water of desiccant silica gel was obserbed at various sorts of the thickness of sedimentary layer (Fig. 7). The efficiency of absorption was investigated under practical applications. 4. A break point was estimated from air condition through desiccant silica gel. Average moisture content of desiccant silica gel was about 27. 5 % (d. b.) at the break point. Relationship between the break point time T (h) and ratio of silica gel weight M (kg) to air flow G (kg/h) was shown as follows. T= 0. 558 + 115. 87 (M/G) 5. Calorific value of absorbent of desiccant silica gel was measured at absorption process. The value of dried silica gel 1 kg was estimated at 450 kcal within the break point time. 6. In order to investigate the drying efficiency fitness for refreshement of desiccant silica gel, heat ventilation drying {{was carried out by}} using high moisture content silica gel. Relationship between <b>refreshment</b> <b>time</b> T (h) and M/G was shown as follows. T= 0. 475 (M/G) ^ 7. The performance of heat pump dehumidifying was investigated. In case of using air with high temperature and humidity under practical applications, removal moisture in the air could be estimated 1. 6 ～ 2. 0 kg/h by 1 kw compressor power in heat pump dehumidifier. 8. As heat pump dehumidifying efficiency changed with absolute and/or relative humidity, it was considered to be suitable for heat pump dehumidifier to have moisture removed from the high temperature and humidity air. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{microbiota}} of a ripe sourdough {{consists of}} {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB), especially of the genus Lactobacillus, and yeasts. Their composition {{is influenced by the}} interplay of species or strains, the kind of substrate as well as the process parameters temperature, dough yield, redox potential, <b>refreshment</b> <b>time,</b> and number of propagation steps (Hammes and Gänzle, 1997). As taste and quality of sourdough breads are mainly influenced by the fermentation microbiota, intense research has been focused on determination of sourdough associated species and search for new starter cultures. In recent years, economic competition pressure and new consumer demands have led to steady research for new cereal products, especially with health benefit or for people suffering from celiac disease. For these reasons, alternative cereals like oat and barley (both toxic for celiac disease patients) as well as the celiac disease compatible cereals rice and maize, sorghum and millets, the pseudocereals amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat as well as cassava got into the focus of interest. However, information about the microbiota of sourdoughs fermented with buckwheat, amaranth, quinoa, oat or barley is not available except for the following recent studies: a study about the microbiota of amaranth sourdoughs by Sterr et al. (2009), a study about barley sourdough by Zannini et al. (2009), a study about oat sourdoughs by Huettner et al. (2010) and a study about buckwheat and teff sourdoughs by Moroni et al. (2011). The microbiota of sourdoughs from the other mentioned cereals as well as cassava was multiply characterised but not systematically. Fermentation conditions were partly not clearly defined, and identification of species was often based on physiological criteria only, known to be insufficient for the exact classification of LAB. Thus, in this thesis, the influence of the process parameters substrate, temperature, <b>refreshment</b> <b>time,</b> amount of backslopping dough as well as the interplay between the different species or strains were examined and potential starter strains were selected. In Chapter III, the effect of the substrate on the sourdough microbiota was examined and suitable starter cultures for fermentation of non-bread cereals and pseudocereals were selected. Eleven different flours from wheat, rye, oat, barley, millet, rice, maize, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat and cassava were inoculated with a starter mixture containing numerous LAB and yeasts. Sourdoughs were fermented at 30 °C and refreshed every 24 hours until the microbiota was stable. Species were identified by PCR-DGGE as well as bacteriological culture and RAPD-PCR, followed by 16 S/ 26 S rRNA sequence analysis. In these fermentations, the dominant yeast was Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Issatchenkia (I.) orientalis was only competitive in the quinoa and the maize sourdough. No yeasts were found in the buckwheat and the oat sourdough. The dominant LAB species were Lactobacillus (L.) paralimentarius in the pseudocereal sourdoughs, L. fermentum, L. helveticus and L. pontis in the cereal sourdoughs, and L. fermentum, L. plantarum and L. spicheri in the cassava sourdough. Competitive LAB and yeasts were inserted as starters for a further fermentation using new flours from rice, maize, millet and the pseudocereals. After ten days of fermentation, most of the starter strains were still dominant, but L. pontis and L. helveticus could not compete with the other species. It is remarkable that from the numerous starter strains which all were adapted to or isolated from sourdoughs, only a few were competitive in these fermentations; but if, then in most cases {{in a lot of different}} flours. In Chapter IV, the effects of the exogenous process parameters substrate, <b>refreshment</b> <b>time,</b> temperature, amount of backslopping dough as well as competing species on the two microbial associations L. sanfranciscensis ? Candida (C.) humilis and L. reuteri ? L. johnsonii ? I. orientalis were examined. Both associations had previously been found to be competitive in sourdough (Kline and Sugihara, 1971 a; Nout and Creemers-Molenaar, 1987; Gobbetti et al., 1994 a; Garofalo et al., 2008; Böcker et al., 1990; Meroth et al., 2003 a). 28 sourdough batches were fermented under defined conditions until the microbiota was stable. Dominant LAB and yeasts were characterized by bacteriological culture, RAPD-PCR and 16 S/ 26 S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The process parameters for the association L. sanfranciscensis ? C. humilis could be defined as follows: rye bran, rye flour or wheat flour as substrate, temperatures between 20 and 30 °C, refreshment times of 12 to 24 hours and amounts of backslopping dough from 5 to 20 %. In addition, the association was predominating against all competing lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. The association L. reuteri ? L. johnsonii ? I. orientalis was competitive at temperatures of 35 to 40 °C, refreshment times of 12 to 24 hours and the substrates rye bran, wheat flour and rye flour, but only with sufficient oxygen supply. Cell counts of I. orientalis fell rapidly under the detection limit when using high amounts of doughs (small ratio of surface to volume) and refreshment times of 12 hours. The fermentations depicted in Chapter III and IV give new information about the influence of process parameters on the sourdough microbiota. The studies show that the sourdough microbiota is markedly influenced by the process parameters and kind and quality of substrate. The competitiveness of a single LAB or yeast is strain specific. Interactions between microorganisms also play an important role. However, for the search for suitable starter strains, it would be beneficial to know the reasons, why a single LAB or yeast strain is better adapted to specific process parameters or substrates than others. One of the starter sourdoughs used for fermentation I described in Chapter III was a sourdough made from cassava flour, inoculated with several LAB. No yeast had been inserted, but several yeasts were isolated from the ripe sourdough, which are supposed to originate from the cassava flour. An unknown yeast species constituted 10 % of the isolated yeasts which is described as novel species Cryptococcus thermophilus sp. nov. in Chapter V. This yeast is characterized by budding on small neck-like structures, no fermentative ability, growth at 42 °C and without vitamins, a major ubiquinone of Q- 10, as well as the production of green or blue fluorescent substances in the growth medium. It is distinct from related species by the ability to assimilate raffinose and cadaverine, the inability to assimilate soluble starch, xylitol, galactitol, butane- 2, 3 -diol, sodium nitrite and lysine, and the inability to produce starch-like substances. The closest relatives are the yeasts belonging to the Cryptococcus humicola complex. Die Mikroflora eines reifen Sauerteiges besteht aus Milchsäurebakterien, insbesondere des Genus Lactobacillus, und Hefen. Ihre Zusammensetzung wird beeinflusst durch die Wechselwirkungen zwischen den einzelnen Spezies bzw. Stämmen, die Art des Substrats sowie die Prozessparameter Temperatur, Teigausbeute, Redoxpotential, Führungsdauer und Zahl der Propagationsschritte (Hammes und Gänzle, 1997). Da Geschmack und Qualität von Sauerteigbroten maßgeblich durch die Fermentationsflora beeinflusst werden, konzentriert sich die Forschung auf die Identifizierung sauerteigassoziierter Spezies und die Suche nach neuen Starterkulturen. In den letzten Jahren führten wirtschaftlicher Konkurrenzdruck und neue Verbraucherwünsche zur stetigen Entwicklung neuer Zerealienprodukte, insbesondere mit gesundheitlichem Nutzen oder für Menschen, die unter Zöliakie leiden. Aus diesen Gründen erlangten alternative Getreidearten wie Hafer und Gerste (beide zöliakietoxisch) sowie die zöliakieverträglichen Getreidearten Reis und Mais, Hirsearten, die Pseudozerealien Amaranth, Quinoa und Buchweizen und auch Maniok Interesse. Informationen über die Mikroflora von Sauerteigen aus Buchweizen, Amaranth, Quinoa, Hafer oder Gerste sind allerdings nicht erhältlich außer den folgenden kürzlich erschienenen Studien: eine Studie über die Mikroflora von Amaranthsauerteigen von Sterr et al. (2009), eine Studie über Gerstensauerteig von Zannini et al. (2009), eine Studie über Hafersauerteige von Huettner et al. (2010) und eine Studie über Buchweizen- und Teffsauerteige von Moroni et al. (2011). Die Sauerteigmikroflora der übrigen oben erwähnten Zerealien sowie Maniok wurde vielfach charakterisiert, jedoch nicht systematisch. Teilweise wurden die Fermentationsbedingungen nicht klar aufgeführt, und die Identifikation der Spezies basierte oft nur auf physiologischen Kriterien, was bekanntermaßen für die exakte Bestimmung von Milchsäurebakterien nicht ausreicht. In dieser Arbeit wurden daher die Einflüsse der Prozessparameter Substrat, Temperatur, Führungsdauer, Menge des Anstellguts sowie Wechselwirkungen zwischen den verschiedenen Spezies bzw. Stämmen auf die Sauerteigmikroflora untersucht und potentielle Starterstämme selektiert. In Kapitel III wurden die Auswirkungen des Substrats auf die Sauerteigmikroflora untersucht sowie geeignete Starterkulturen für die Fermentation von Nichtbrotgetreidearten und Pseudozerealien selektiert. Elf verschiedene Mehle aus Weizen, Roggen, Hafer, Gerste, Millet, Reis, Mais, Amaranth, Quinoa, Buchweizen und Maniok wurden mit einer Startermischung inokuliert, die eine Vielzahl von Milchsäurebakterien und Hefen enthielt. Die Sauerteige wurden bei 30 °C fermentiert und alle 24 Stunden neu angefrischt, bis die Mikroflora stabil war. Spezies wurden mittels PCR-DGGE sowie mit bakteriologischer Kulturtechnik und RAPD-PCR gefolgt von 16 S/ 26 S rRNA-Sequenzanalyse identifiziert. In diesen Fermentationen war Saccharomyces cerevisiae die dominierende Hefe; Issatchenkia (I.) orientalis war nur im Quinoa- und im Maissauerteig wettbewerbsfähig. Im Buchweizen- und im Hafersauerteig wurden keine Hefen gefunden. Die dominanten Milchsäure¬bakterienspezies waren Lactobacillus (L.) paralimentarius in den Pseudozerealiensauerteigen, L. fermentum, L. helveticus und L. pontis in den Zerealiensauerteigen sowie L. fermentum, L. plantarum und L. spicheri im Manioksauerteig. Wettbewerbsstarke Milchsäurebakterien und Hefen wurden als Starter für eine weitere Fermentation eingesetzt, wobei neue Mehle aus Reis, Mais, Millet und den Pseudozerealien verwendet wurden. Nach zehntägiger Fermentation waren die meisten der Starterstämme noch dominant, jedoch konnten L. pontis und L. helveticus nicht mit den anderen Spezies mithalten. Es ist bemerkenswert, dass von den zahlreichen Starterstämmen, die alle an Sauerteig adaptiert waren oder aus Sauerteigen isoliert wurden, nur einige wenige in diesen Fermentationen wettbewerbsstark waren; aber wenn, dann meist in vielen verschiedenen Mehlen. In Kapitel IV wurden die Auswirkungen der exogenen Prozessparameter Substrat, Führungsdauer, Temperatur, Menge des Anstellguts sowie konkurrierender Spezies auf die beiden mikrobiellen Gemeinschaften L. sanfranciscensis ? Candida (C.) humilis und L. reuteri ? L. johnsonii ? I. orientalis untersucht. Beide Gemeinschaften wurden im Vorfeld als wettbewerbsfähig im Sauerteig befunden (Kline und Sugihara, 1971 a; Nout und Creemers-Molenaar, 1987; Gobbetti et al., 1994 a; Garofalo et al., 2008; Böcker et al., 1990; Meroth et al., 2003 a). 28 Sauerteigansätze wurden unter definierten Bedingungen fermentiert, bis die Mikroflora stabil war. Dominante Milchsäurebakterien und Hefen wurden mit bakterio-logischer Kulturtechnik, RAPD-PCR und 16 S/ 26 S rRNA-Gen-Sequenzanalyse identifiziert. Die Prozessparameter für die Gemeinschaft L. sanfranciscensis ? C. humilis konnten folgendermaßen definiert werden: Roggenkleie, Roggen- oder Weizenmehl als Substrat, Temperaturen zwischen 20 und 30 °C, eine Führungsdauer von 12 bis 24 Stunden und eine Anstellgutmenge von 5 bis 20 %. Zudem war die Gemeinschaft vorherrschend gegen alle konkurrierenden Milchsäurebakterien und Hefen. Die Gemeinschaft L. reuteri ? L. johnsonii ? I. orientalis war wettbewerbsfähig bei Temperaturen zwischen 35 und 40 °C, Führungs¬zeiten von 12 bis 24 Stunden und mit den Substraten Roggenkleie, Roggen- oder Weizen¬mehl, jedoch nur bei ausreichender Sauerstoffversorgung. Die Zellzahlen von I. orientalis fielen bei großen Teigmengen (geringes Verhältnis von Oberfläche zu Volumen) und Führungszeiten von 12 Stunden rasch unter die Nachweisgrenze. Die Fermentationen aus Kapitel III und IV geben neue Informationen über die Auswirkungen von Prozessparametern auf die Sauerteigmikroflora. Die Studien zeigen, dass die Sauerteigmikroflora durch die Prozessparameter und die Art und Qualität des Substrats ausgesprochen beeinflusst wird. Die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit eines einzelnen Milchsäure-bakteriums oder einer Hefe ist stammspezifisch. Auch Wechselwirkungen zwischen Mikroorganismen spielen eine bedeutende Rolle. Jedoch wäre es für die Suche nach passenden Starterstämmen von Vorteil, die Gründe zu kennen, warum ein einzelner Milchsäurebakterien- oder Hefestamm besser an spezifische Prozessparameter oder Substrate angepasst ist als andere. Einer der Startersauerteige für die Fermentation I in Kapitel III war ein Sauerteig aus Maniokmehl, inokuliert mit verschiedenen Milchsäurebakterien. Es wurde keine Hefe eingesetzt, jedoch wurden mehrere Hefen aus dem reifen Sauerteig isoliert, welche wahrscheinlich aus dem Maniokmehl stammen. 10 % der isolierten Hefen stellte eine unbekannte Hefespezies dar, welche als neue Spezies Cryptococcus thermophilus sp. nov. in Kapitel V beschrieben wird. Diese Hefe ist charakterisiert durch Knospung an kurzen halsartigen Fortsätzen, Wachstum bei 42 °C und ohne Vitamine, Q- 10 als Hauptubichinon sowie die Produktion von grün oder blau fluoreszierenden Substanzen im Wachstumsmedium. Sie unterscheidet sich von verwandten Spezies durch die Fähigkeit zur Assimilation von Raffinose und Cadaverin, die Unfähigkeit zur Assimilation löslicher Stärke, Xylitol, Galactitol, Butan- 2, 3 -diol, Natriumnitrit und Lysin und die Unfähigkeit zur Bildung stärkeähnlicher Substanzen.

60|$|It {{had been}} the usual custom of the emperor, at such entertainments, {{to take a little}} recess about noon, for rest and refreshments. It devolved upon Chærea to wait upon him at this time, and to conduct him from his place in the theater to an {{adjoining}} apartment in his palace which was connected with the theater, where there was provided a bath and various <b>refreshments.</b> When the <b>time</b> arrived, and Chærea perceived, as he thought, that the emperor was about to go, he himself went out, and stationed himself in a passage-way leading to the bath, intending to intercept and assassinate the emperor when he should come along. The emperor, however, delayed his departure, having fallen into conversation with his courtiers and friends, and finally he said that, on the whole, as it was {{the last day of the}} festival, he would not go out to the bath, but would remain in the theater; and then ordering refreshments to be brought to him there, he proceeded to distribute them with great urbanity to the officers around him.|$|R
5000|$|William Niblo built Niblo's Theater in 1834 {{after having}} opened a [...] "resort" [...] which at first only served coffee, ice cream, {{lemonade}} and other <b>refreshments.</b> At the <b>time</b> New York was undergoing a construction boom that was extending clusters of buildings much past the locale of City Hall. The garden, {{surrounded by a}} plain board fence, covered the block bounded by Prince, Houston, Broadway and Crosby Streets; in the center was the open-air saloon, used also for musical entertainments. In the evenings, Niblo's Garden was illuminated with hundreds of colored-glass lanterns. A separate garden entrance was on Broadway. The refreshment hall was {{in a pair of}} rowhouses near the southeast corner of the gardens. The site was once a part of the Bayard farm. It was sold in lots and purchased by Jeremiah Van Rensselaer. Prior to Niblo's acquisition of the land, a circus called the Stadium occupied the ground. There was a high fence around it. New Yorkers considered it a beautiful drive up to Niblo's through neighboring suburban market gardens.|$|R
6000|$|But a dark frown clouded his brow, for as he {{went along}} his {{thoughts}} were busy with what he {{believed to be the}} insolent pride of Sir James Clubley. He also thought of May Maylands, and the resolution with which she so firmly yet so gently repelled him. The latter thought wounded his pride as well as his feelings deeply. While in this mood the spirit of the sea-kings arose within him once again. He entered a public-house and had another pot of beer. It was very refreshing--remarkably so! True, the tall and stalwart young frame of George Aspel needed no <b>refreshment</b> at the <b>time,</b> and he would have scorned the insinuation that he required anything to support him--but--but--it was decidedly refreshing! There could be no doubt whatever about that, and it induced him to take a more amiable view of men in general--of [...] "poor Abel Bones" [...] in particular. He even felt less savagely disposed towards Sir James, though he by no means forgave him, but made up his mind finally to have nothing more to do with him, while as to May--hope told him flattering tales.|$|R
60|$|Very {{precious}} {{were these}} walks, with the quiet grave talk that {{the scene and}} the circumstances inspired--when he would tell the thoughts that had occupied him in his night-watches, and they shared the subdued and deep reflection suited to this period of apprehension. These were her happiest times, but they were few and uncertain. She had in the meantime to wait, to watch, and hope alone, though she had plenty of employment; for besides writing constant bulletins, all preparations for the sickroom fell to her share. She had to send for or devise substitutes for all the conveniences that were far from coming readily to hand in a remote Italian inn--to give orders, send commissions to Vicenza, or even to Venice, and {{to do a good}} deal, with Anne's' assistance, by her own manual labour. Guy said she did more for Philip outside his room than he did inside, and often declared how entirely at a loss he should have been if she had not been there, with her ready resources, and, above all, with her sweet presence, making the short intervals he spent out of the sick chamber so much more than repose, such <b>refreshment</b> at the <b>time,</b> and in remembrance.|$|R
40|$|Mice {{represent}} one of {{the most}} important animal models for biomedical research. For the scientific community, the ability of flying mice under weightless conditions in space offers many valuable advantages respect to other rodents. These advantages includes the option of testing a wide range of transgenic animals, the ability to increase the number of animals that can be flown, and reduced demands on shuttle resources (food, water, mass and air <b>refreshment)</b> and crew <b>time</b> (for water refill). In this study, we report the biocompatibility tests of the first European automated rodent spaceflight payload, the Mouse Drawer System (MDS), which is compatible to the configuration of space shuttle middeck and space station freedom express rack. Six mice were housed individually inside the MDS engineering model for 20 and 100 days. All mice survived, lost weight after the 20 -day test, but gained weight after the 100 -day test. No abnormality was detected by haematological analysis, or by necropsy. These tests showed that the payload meets NIH guideline for temperature, humidity, food and water access, air quality, odor and waste management; mechanical and electronic components of MDS can support animal experiments for at least 100 days. The payload is now ready to take off in the upcoming MDS space mission...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the day of}} the fête, Hattie {{receives}} a letter from her cousin, Etienne de Sousa, who will visit that day; she appears very upset by his abrupt visit. A local Girl Guide, Marlene Tucker, waits in the boathouse to pose as the dead victim when a player finds the key to enter. Her first visitor is Miss Brewis with a tray of <b>refreshments</b> at tea <b>time,</b> at Hattie's request. With Mrs. Oliver, Poirot discovers Marlene dead in the boathouse. Hattie cannot be found. Mrs. Oliver produces an abundance of theories to explain the murder and the disappearance, while the police and Poirot narrow the field from all attending the fête, to those familiar with the Murder Hunt. The investigation focuses first on Etienne de Sousa and briefly on Amanda Brewis. Further confusion is added by the behaviour of the Legges, staying in a cottage on the estate and whose marriage is in trouble. After weeks of no progress, Poirot visits Devon again, learning that Hattie is still missing. Merdell, the old boatman, who drowned, was Marlene's grandfather. Poirot puts together several stray clues: Marlene's grandfather had seen a woman's body in the woods; Marlene received small sums of money used to make small purchases, now in her younger sister's possession. Merdell had told Poirot mischievously that there would [...] "always be Folliats at Nasse House".|$|R
40|$|Root canal {{treatment}} {{is aimed at}} the removal of inflamed and infected tissue present in the root canal system. It will prevent the entrance of new microorganisms or nutrients {{in order to maintain}} or create a healthy environment around the root. There is sufficient evidence that shows that traditional endodontic therapy cannot make the root canal system completely free of bacteria. Moreover, it may not always result in complete healing of apical periodontitis, highlighting the need of optimizing the cleaning procedures. In this thesis, new models and methodologies were examined to measure, to image and to compare the cleaning efficiency of various irrigation methods and solutions and to optimize the chemical aspect of root canal irrigation. Strategies for optimizing the chemical efficiency of NaOCl in contact with dentine were suggested by analyzing the effect of concentration, temperature, pH, laser and ultrasonic activated irrigation, irrigant <b>refreshment</b> and exposure <b>time</b> in the reaction rate of NaOCl. This work also brought new insight to the evolution of temperature and pH of irrigants during root canal therapy; on the occurrence of transient cavitation around sonic and ultrasonic activated endodontic instruments. Finally, the cleaning efficiency of different irrigation methods and solutions in confined accessory root canal anatomy was investigated with the introduction, in endodontic research, of a novel hydrogel model that mimics the biofilm viscoelastic properties. The results reported in this thesis, contribute to the scientific and clinical awareness of the mechanical and chemical aspects of irrigation, which may lead to a better clinical outcome...|$|R
