40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to reduce {{production}} costs for UHPFRC members by using a bundle of longitudinal <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> as a substitute for steel fiber. Experiments on the ductile behavior of Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) rectangular beams with a combination of steel fiber and longitudinal <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> were performed. The volume fractions of steel fiber were 0 %, 0. 7 %, 1 %, 1. 5 %, 2 %, and the reinforcement ratios of longitudinal <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> that promoted ductile behavior were 0. 0036, 0. 016, 0. 029 and 0. 036. Fifteen UHPC beams were made with the combination of these test factors. Both the steel fiber and the longitudinal <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> had the effect of induciing ductile behavior for UHPC structural members. The load-deflection relationship, the concrete stress variation and the crack pattern indicated the usefulness of the bundle of longitudinal bars that have a small diameter with close arrangement...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} work studying the factors influencing {{on the service}} life of hot-dip galvanised <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars.</b> The experimental {{part of the study}} consisted of accelerated corrosion tests among others. The comparison of the measured crack width of concrete with the rate of corrosion values, and also with other measured values such as the corrosion potential, the resistivity of concrete, and the mechanical properties of the steel indicated no correlation irrespective of the duration of the exposure or type of aggressive liquid. The rate of corrosion decreased as a function of exposure time. This was not dependent on the water-to-cement ratio of concrete. Three probable corrosion mechanisms are determined for hot-dip galvanised <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> in cracked concrete, based on long-term durability tests and other studies. The first mechanism consists of a local dissolution of the eta (η) and zeta (ζ) phases of the zinc layer. In the second mechanism, {{as a result of the}} non-uniformity of the zinc coating, local dissolution of the eta (η) and zeta (ζ) phases, together with longitudinal and perpendicular cracking in the zinc layer, may lead to the local separation of the zinc layer. In the third mechanism, as a result of the non-uniformity of the zinc coating, full dissolution of eta (η) phase and partial dissolution of the zeta (ζ) phase, together with longitudinal and perpendicular cracking in the ferrite, may lead to the local separation of the zinc layer and the ferrite. The effects of different reinforcing steels on the service life of outdoor concrete structures were estimated through calculations. A stochastic method based on the probability of damage, Monte Carlo simulation, and reliability and sensitivity analyses were also used. In carbonated intact and cracked concrete the use of hot-dip galvanised <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> could double the service life compared with the use of ordinary steel <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars.</b> In chloride-contaminated intact concrete the service life as a result of using hot-dip galvanised <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars</b> is 3 - 5 times longer compared with ordinary steel <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars.</b> The conclusion is based on the results received with the critical water-soluble chloride content, 1. 0 - 1. 5 wt%CEM, which is substantially higher than the critical water-soluble chloride content, 0. 3 - 0. 4 wt%CEM, for ordinary steel <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bars...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{decommissioning}} {{begins with}} the draining of fuel and fire fighting liquid, which is sold to the trade. Any re-usable items—wiring, furniture and machinery—are sent to local markets or the trade. Unwanted materials become inputs to their relevant waste streams. Often, in lower income nations, these industries are no better than ship breaking. For example, the toxic insulation is usually burnt off copper wire to access the metal. Some crude safety precautions exist—chickens are lowered into the chambers of the ship, and if the birds return alive, they are considered safe. Workers also do not have proper clothing, footwear and masks.Sledgehammers and oxy-acetylene gas-torches are used to cut up the steel hull. Cranes are not typically used on the ship, because of costs. Pieces of the hull simply fall off and are dragged inland, possibly aided with a winch or bulldozer. These are then cut into smaller pieces away from the coast. 90% of the steel is re-rollable scrap: higher quality steel plates that are heated and reused as <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> for construction. The remainder is transported to electric arc furnaces to be melted down into ingots for re-rolling mills. In the re-rolling mills, the heating of painted steel plates (in particular, those painted with chlorinated rubber paints) generates dioxins. Substances which are costly to dispose of, such as hazardous waste, are left on the beach or set on fire, even old batteries and half-empty cans of paint. Stockpiled in Bangladesh, for example, are 79,000 tonnes of asbestos, 240,000 tonnes of PCBs and 210,000 tonnes of ozone-depleting substances (mainly chlorinated polyurethane foam).|$|E

30|$|The bar {{buckling}} and bar fracture damage {{states were}} calculated {{according to the}} equations developed by Berry and Eberhard (2007).

Incorporating the effect of load history on <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> buckling limit state—as shown in past studies (e.g., Rodriguez et al. 1999)—under the first seismic event may significantly alter the obtained results for the subsequent seismic event.

40|$|A {{spectral}} element model updating {{procedure is}} presented to identify damage in a structure using Guided wave propagation results. Two damage spectral elements (DSE 1 and DSE 2) are developed to model the local (cracks in <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar)</b> and global (debonding between <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> and concrete) damage in one-dimensional homogeneous and composite waveguide, respectively. Transfer matrix method is adopted to assemble the stiffness matrix of multiple spectral elements. In order to solve the inverse problem, clonal selection algorithm {{is used for the}} optimization calculations. Two displacement-based functions and two frequency-based functions are used as objective functions in this study. Numerical simulations of wave propagation in a bare steel bar and in a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> without and with various assumed damage scenarios are carried out. Numerically simulated data are then used to identify local and global damage of the steel rebar and the concrete-steel interface using the proposed method. Results show that local damage is easy to be identified by using any considered objective function with the proposed method while only using the wavelet energy-based objective function gives reliable identification of global damage. The method is then extended to identify multiple damages in a structure. To further verify the proposed method, experiments of wave propagation in a rectangular steel bar before and after damage are conducted. The proposed method is used to update the structural model for damage identification. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in identifying cracks in steel bars based on measured wave propagation data...|$|E
40|$|Former {{research}} indicates that the crack width close to the bar can be a better indicator for the risk for reinforcement corrosion than, as current concrete codes impose, the crack width at the concrete surface. In this paper a finite-element model is used to increase the {{understanding of how the}} crack width varies at different levels from the reinforcement and how different mechanisms control this behaviour. Concrete and reinforcement are modelled with solid elements, where nonlinear fracture mechanics is used for the concrete material and a model, which has been modified for this purpose, describes the bond between steel and concrete. The results of the finite-element calculations of the crack widths are compared to earlier experimental studies. Both the finite-element analysis and experimental studies are performed on axially loaded concrete prisms with a central 16 mm <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> and concrete covers of 30, 50 and 70 mm. The finite-element analysis verifies the results from former experimental research, where the crack widths close to the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bar</b> are affected only slightly, or not at all, by the concrete cover.
