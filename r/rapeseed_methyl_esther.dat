Although the market share of biofuels is still barely significant with respect to total fuel consumption, biofuel production has significantly increased during the past decade due to a favourable framework and the support of several policies. Europe’s contribution to biofuel production is foreseen to increase in the coming decades.

40|$|Abstract: Life Cycle Assessments (LCA, {{including}} Well-to-Wheel studies) {{that are}} to support decisions that strive to change large technical systems need to consider time and scale related factors, which are given little attention in standard LCA procedures. Here, we address three issues and provide examples from the case of alternative fuels. First, shifting time frame gives room for technical development that should affect not only the choice of performance data, but perhaps also the functional unit and the selection of technologies under study. Secondly, background systems, such as heat and power production, change over time and increased production volumes of the alternative fuel change the transport system {{that is used to}} produce transport fuel. We show that such changes have consequences not only for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from each fuel-chain, but also for the ranking order of, e. g. <b>Rapeseed</b> <b>Methyl</b> <b>Esther</b> (RME) and ethanol in terms of GHG emissions. Finally, different types of feedstock are available in different quantities and different by-product markets vary in size. Key markets for RME by-products in EU correspond to an RME production that covers about 3 % of transport fuel demand. Consequently, GHG emissions that are allocated to the fuel should change with the scale of adoption...|$|E

40|$|The storage stabilities of {{fuel grade}} camelina, {{sunflower}} and <b>rapeseed</b> <b>methyl</b> esters were evaluated in airtight and open containers. Commercial amounts (200 litres) of the methyl esters were stored in airtight drums and sampled regularly, {{and the effects}} of air exposure were evaluated from sixteen days laboratory-scale accelerated storage tests at 65 oC. None of the methyl esters in airtight drums deteriorated during eighteen months of storage; composition, viscosities and free fatty acid levels remained unchanged. The accelerated storage test in open containers, however, indicated that exposure to air can cause rapid oxidation of each of the three methyl esters. However, oxidation can be delayed by the presence of tocopherols (natural antioxidants) in the methyl ester, and it can be further delayed by the presence of an unidentified carotenoid. The exceptional stability of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>methyl</b> ester seems to be due to a combination of relatively high levels of Μ-tocopherol and the unidentified carotenoid. The rates of oxidation (i. e. rate of increase of viscosity etc.) of sunflower and camelina methyl esters were about the same, but <b>rapeseed</b> <b>methyl</b> ester oxidised slower.
