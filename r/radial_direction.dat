5|$|The {{electrostatic}} force was first described in 1784 by Coulomb {{as a force}} that existed intrinsically between two charges. The properties of the {{electrostatic force}} were that it varied as an inverse square law directed in the <b>radial</b> <b>direction,</b> was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic polarity), was independent {{of the mass of}} the charged objects, and followed the superposition principle. Coulomb's law unifies all these observations into one succinct statement.|$|E
5|$|Since in {{the limit}} the forces are {{parallel}} to SP and sp, {{if the same}} force acted on the body in Fig. 2 as in Fig. 1, the body would arrive at y, since ry = RQ. The difference in horizontal speed {{does not affect the}} vertical distances. Newton refers to Corollary 2 of the Laws of Motion where the motion of the bodies is resolved into a component in the <b>radial</b> <b>direction</b> acted on by the whole force, and the other component transverse to it, acted on by no force.|$|E
5|$|The inner moons {{are closely}} {{associated}} with Neptune's rings. The two innermost satellites, Naiad and Thalassa, orbit between the Galle and LeVerrier rings. Despina may be a shepherd moon of the LeVerrier ring, because its orbit lies just inside this ring. The next moon, Galatea, orbits just inside {{the most prominent of}} Neptune's rings, the Adams ring. This ring is very narrow, with a width not exceeding 50km, and has five embedded bright arcs. The gravity of Galatea helps confine the ring particles within a limited region in the <b>radial</b> <b>direction,</b> maintaining the narrow ring. Various resonances between the ring particles and Galatea may also have a role in maintaining the arcs.|$|E

30|$|In general, {{tropical}} {{trees have}} less-distinct growth rings. Even if the trees have some concentric structures, {{there is little}} information on the timing of their formation. The objective of this report is to show the asynchronous wood formation from the observation of indistinct, ring-like structures. YoungAcacia mangium planted in Malaysia was investigated for asynchronous wood formation anatomically and macroscopically. Tree heights and girths at breast height for 28 trees were measured every other week. Wood disks from four trees were sampled at breast height for this research. The radial variation of vessel dimensions {{and the number of}} cambial cells in different <b>radial</b> <b>directions</b> and the wood anatomy of discontinuous bands were investigated using thin sectioning and soft radiographic methods. The vessel dimension was quite different in their radial variation even for four <b>radial</b> <b>directions</b> with a similar radius. There was a large variation in the number of cambial cells among <b>radial</b> <b>directions</b> in youngAcacia mangium. Bands of low density included a layer of vessels aligned in a spiral rather than in a closed circle.|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, there was {{evidence}} that in the <b>radial</b> <b>direction</b> they are rather soft. The first transmission electron microscope observation of radial elasticity suggested that even the van der Waals forces can deform two adjacent nanotubes. Later, nanoindentations with atomic force microscope were performed by several groups to quantitatively measure radial elasticity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and tapping/contact mode atomic force microscopy was also performed on single-walled carbon nanotubes. Young's modulus of {{on the order of}} several GPa showed that CNTs are in fact very soft in the <b>radial</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Applying Newton's laws, {{multiplying}} {{the acceleration}} by {{the mass of}} the walker, the inertial observer concludes that the walker is subject to two forces: the inward, radially directed centripetal force, and another force perpendicular to the <b>radial</b> <b>direction</b> that is proportional to the speed of the walker.|$|E
25|$|Shrinkage and {{swelling}} may occur in wood when the moisture content is changed (Stamm, 1964). Shrinkage occurs as moisture content decreases, while swelling takes place when it increases. Volume {{change is not}} equal in all directions. The greatest dimensional change occurs in a direction tangential to the growth rings. Shrinkage from the pith outwards, or radially, is usually considerably less than tangential shrinkage, while longitudinal (along the grain) shrinkage is so slight as to be usually neglected. The longitudinal shrinkage is 0.1% to 0.3%, in contrast to transverse shrinkages, which is 2% to 10%. Tangential shrinkage is often about twice as great as in the <b>radial</b> <b>direction,</b> although in some species it is as much as five times as great. The shrinkage is about 5% to 10% in the tangential direction and about 2% to 6% in the <b>radial</b> <b>direction</b> (Walker et al., 1993).|$|E

The gun fires mixtures of 02, H 2, He or 02, H 2, He, CO. Observations are made along three optical paths and they are analyzed using optical computer tomography. The gas-barrel interface temperature is measured with a fast response surface thermocouple.

40|$|This {{research}} was developed after consultations with tropical timber exporters, who were facing {{problems with the}} colors of the species under study. This work aimed at characterizing Simarouba amara tropical wood color and verifying possible differences between the colorimetric parameters determined for the tangential and the <b>radial</b> <b>directions</b> of the wood, kiln-dried and air-dried. S. amara wood presents a grayish-white color. This color is mainly characterized by the b* coordinate (yellow pigment).

40|$|Abstract. A {{capacitance}} sensor {{has been}} designed to investigate the correlation between wood capacitance value, Janka hardness rating and density. The sensor was developed based on parallel plates using copper as the electrodes. Capacitance values were measured using CV-circuit, 20 Vp-p, 2. 5 MHz. Five wood specimens from forest plantation that is rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), blackboard tree (Alstonia sp.), pine (Pinus mercusii), sengon (Paraserianthes falcataria), and fast growing teak (Tectona grandis) were tested. Each specimen was measured in tangential and <b>radial</b> <b>directions</b> under 0 % moisture content conditions.

25|$|Diagonal or {{mixed-flow}} compressors {{are similar}} to centrifugal compressors, but have a radial and axial velocity component {{at the exit from}} the rotor. The diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to an axial rather than <b>radial</b> <b>direction.</b> Comparative to the conventional centrifugal compressor (of the same stage pressure ratio), the value of the speed of the mixed flow compressor is 1.5 times larger.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the drum}} modes {{analogous}} to p and d modes in an atom show spatial irregularity along the different radial directions {{from the center}} of the drum, whereas all of the modes analogous to smodes are perfectly symmetrical in <b>radial</b> <b>direction.</b> The non radial-symmetry properties of non-s orbitals are necessary to localize a particle with angular momentum and a wave nature in an orbital where it must tend to stay away from the central attraction force, since any particle localized at the point of central attraction could have no angular momentum. For these modes, waves in the drum head tend to avoid the central point. Such features again emphasize that the shapes of atomic orbitals are a direct consequence of the wave nature of electrons.|$|E
25|$|Newton's laws {{of motion}} {{describe}} {{the motion of}} an object in an inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference. When Newton's laws are transformed to a rotating frame of reference, the Coriolis force and centrifugal force appear. Both forces are proportional to {{the mass of the}} object. The Coriolis force is proportional to the rotation rate and the centrifugal force is proportional to its square. The Coriolis force acts in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and to the velocity of the body in the rotating frame and is proportional to the object's speed in the rotating frame (more precisely, to the component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation). The centrifugal force acts outwards in the <b>radial</b> <b>direction</b> and is proportional to the distance of the body from the axis of the rotating frame. These additional forces are termed inertial forces, fictitious forces or pseudo forces. They allow the application of Newton's laws to a rotating system. They are correction factors that do not exist in a non-accelerating or inertial reference frame.|$|E

The present study modeled the RMBR using a plug flow reactor model incorporated with kinetic models expressed in simple power-law model. Catalyst activity and coke formation were also considered.

25|$|In the United States and a {{few other}} countries, Doppler capable weather radar {{stations}} are used. These devices are capable of measuring the radial velocity, including <b>radial</b> <b>direction</b> (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160nbsp&km) away. A supercell is characterized by a mesocyclone, which is usually first observed in velocity data as a tight, cyclonic structure in the middle levels of the thunderstorm. If it meets certain requirements of strength, duration, and vorticity, it may trip the mesocyclone detection algorithm (MDA). Tornadic signatures are indicated by a cyclonic inbound-outbound velocity couplet, where strong winds flowing in one direction and strong winds flowing in the opposite direction are occurring in very close proximity. The algorithm for this is the tornadic vortex signature (TVS) or the tornado detection algorithm (TDA). TVS is then an extremely strong mesocyclone found at very low level and extending over a deep layer of the thunderstorm, not the actual tornadic circulation. The TVS is, however, indicative of a likely tornado or an incipient tornado. The couplet and TVS typically precede tornado formation by 10–30 minutes but may occur at nearly the same time or precede the tornado by 45 minutes or more. Polarimetric radar can discern meteorological and nonmeteorological and other characteristics of hydrometeors that are helpful to tornado detection and nowcasting. Nonmeteorological reflectors co-located with a couplet, can confirm that a tornado has likely occurred and lofted debris. An area of high reflectivity, or debris ball, may also be visible {{on the end of the}} hook. Either the polarimetric data or debris ball are formally known as the tornado debris signature (TDS). The hook echo feature is formed as the RFD occludes precipitation around the mesocyclone and is also indicative of a probable tornado (tornadogenesis usually ensues shortly after the RFD reaches the surface).|$|E
500|$|Today, most {{developed}} countries have {{a network of}} weather radars, which remains the main method of detecting signatures probably associated with tornadoes. In the United States {{and a few other}} countries, Doppler weather radar stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and <b>radial</b> <b>direction</b> (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than [...] away. When storms are distant from a radar, only areas high within the storm are observed and the important areas below are not sampled. Data resolution also decreases with distance from the radar. Some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data. Doppler radar systems can detect mesocyclones within the supercell of a thunderstorm. This allows meteorologists to predict tornado formations throughout thunderstorms.|$|E

This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.|$|E
