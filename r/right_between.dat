25|$|Although Arakan {{had been}} de facto {{independent}} {{since the late}} Pagan period, the Laungkyet dynasty of Arakan was ineffectual. Until {{the founding of the}} Mrauk-U Kingdom in 1429, Arakan was often caught between bigger neighbours, and found itself a battlefield during the Forty Years' War between Ava and Pegu. Mrauk-U went on to be a powerful kingdom in its own <b>right</b> <b>between</b> 15th and 17th centuries, including East Bengal between 1459 and 1666.

25|$|In {{application}} of Archduke Charles's {{plan to take}} the enemy in a double envelopment, Feldmarshalleutnant Klenau, commanding VI Korps, and Feldzeugmeister Kollowrat, commanding III Korps, moved forward towards the French left. Both commanders had received their orders very late and both had a long distance to cover before they could reach their assigned positions. They {{did their best to}} comply but, given the difficulties of a long night march, their leading elements could only manage to arrive on the Austrian <b>right</b> <b>between</b> 07:30 and 08:00, three hours later than Charles had planned.|$|E
25|$|The first {{plan which}} Wolfe {{mentioned}} {{in his journal}} and the correspondence with his officers is that of 16 July. In a letter to Brigadier Robert Monckton, Wolfe wrote that {{he had hoped to}} capture one of the French redoubts, the second one counting from the east end of the Beauport line, in order to force the enemy out of their entrenchments. The plan involved an attack by the Navy, an important landing force transported from Île d'Orléans, as well as a body of troops crossing the river Montmorency on rafts and marching westward to the battle site. At the same time, the brigade commanded by Monckton was to land on the French <b>right,</b> <b>between</b> the Saint-Charles River and Beauport.|$|E

The survivors of the 16th Infantry were combined with the 19th Infantry while the 15th Infantry and 18th Infantry had less than half of their men present, many of them wounded.

25|$|With Patrese out, Senna led Piquet, who {{was having}} {{to hold off}} Alesi, by over a minute. Alesi {{squeezed}} up to second on lap 53, while four laps later Prost disposed of Modena. Then on lap 70, Prost went from fourth to second in one move at turn five. With Alesi and Piquet running second and third, Piquet's Benetton pulled alongside Alesi– who had set the race's fastest lap while Prost was in the pits– in Turn Four, but could not get by. Down the straight, however, Piquet passed Alesi for second place. Prost also went by his new teammate on the left, and then sliced back to the <b>right,</b> <b>between</b> Alesi and Piquet, beating Piquet to the apex of Turn Five and regaining second place. By now Senna led by 40 seconds.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} in question, Bellamy made several harassing {{telephone}} calls, including one to the Natchez Trace Restaurant where Sadler and Sharpe were having dinner and drinks with two friends. That resulted in Sadler asking a bartender to telephone the police, who never responded. Bellamy later went to Sharpe's apartment complex {{and knocked on the}} door. Sadler exited through a side door. On seeing Sadler, Bellamy fled to his van. It was at this time, Sadler testified, that he saw a flash of metal. Believing it to be a gun, he fired one shot. The bullet struck Bellamy <b>right</b> <b>between</b> the eyes, and he died several hours later in a Nashville hospital. It turned out that Bellamy was unarmed. According to court records, Sadler had then placed a handgun in Bellamy's van, presumably to strengthen his claim of self-defense. After a plea bargain, on June 1, 1979, Sadler was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the death of Lee Emerson Bellamy, and sentenced to from 4 to 5 years in prison. His legal team worked to lower the sentence, which a judge reduced to just 30 days in the county workhouse. He served 28 days. Sadler was sued for wrongful death by Bellamy's stepson, and was ordered to pay compensation of about $10,000.|$|E

500|$|According to Gay, {{characters}} with [...] "extreme personality quirks" [...] were both fun and stressful to write: for the clown Moe, {{he found it}} challenging to get the balance <b>right</b> <b>between</b> his silly jokes and the seriousness of his dialogue. Among other challenging characters to write for were Acro, who led to [...] "heated arguments" [...] {{about how to get}} his personality and tone right; and Morgan Fey, whose [...] "very old style" [...] of speaking in the Japanese version was difficult to translate to English. One aspect they had to change due to cultural differences was a conversation with the lecherous character Director Hotti, where an animation of him grabbing in the air with his hands is played while he talks about Pearl. According to Hsu, the Japanese version is considered funny to Japanese people, as Hotti is set up as the [...] "butt of the joke", and Phoenix reacts negatively to him, while it would have been considered sickening to an American audience. They were unable to change the animation, so the dialogue was rewritten to instead be directed at an adult nurse.|$|E
500|$|Two {{varieties}} of inequality violate {{the doctrine of}} reasonable classification: over-inclusiveness and under-inclusiveness. If a classification is over-inclusive, the net cast by the legislature catches a class of persons not contemplated as falling within {{the objectives of the}} Act. Conversely, an under-inclusive classification arises if the net cast does not catch a class of persons who clearly do fall within the mischief sought to be addressed. Tussman and tenBroek represent the two inequalities in a Venn diagram, an adaptation of which is reproduced on the <b>right.</b> <b>Between</b> the two inequalities, over-inclusiveness is a more egregious violation of the equal protection provision in the Constitution, for it affects the [...] "innocent bystander, the hapless victim of circumstance or association". In comparison, under-inclusiveness should not be fatal. The Court of Appeal in Taw Cheng Kong held that, keeping in mind practical considerations, [...] "the enactment of a provision need not be seamless and perfect to cover every contingency". The legislature is reasonably entitled to address the mischief [...] "in a piecemeal fashion", as the equal protection clause is not [...] "a pedagogic requirement of the impracticable".|$|E

500|$|The {{better part}} of the French army debouched through the Höll valley. Desaix's left wing {{included}} the nine battalions and 12 squadrons of the Division St. Suzanne by Riegel, straddling both shores of the Elz. To the <b>right,</b> <b>between</b> Malterdingen and Emmendingen, Beaupuy commanded a division of 12 battalions and 12 squadrons. [...] Further to the right, by Emmendingen itself, and in the heights by Heimbach, stood Saint-Cyr; around this stretched the Duhesme's Division (12 battalions and eight squadrons). [...] Further to the right of these, in the Elz valley by Waldkirch stood Ambert's division and the Girard brigade; by Zähringen, about a mile away, Lecourbe's brigade stood in reserve, and, stretching northward from there, a mounted division of 14,000 roamed the vicinity of Holzhausen (nowadays part of March, Breisgau). These positions created a line about [...] long. [...] On the far side of Lecorbe's brigade stood Ferino's 15 battalions and 16 squadrons, but these were well to the south and east of Freiburg im Breisgau, still tramping through the mountains. Everyone had been hampered by heavy rains; the ground was soft and slippery, and both the Rhine and Elz rivers had flooded, as had the many tributaries. This increased the hazards of mounted attack, because the horses could not get a good footing.|$|E
500|$|Anas Sarwar {{announced}} {{details of}} the timetable for the contest on 26 October 2014, following a meeting of Scottish Labour's executive committee. Potential candidates would be invited to declare their interest from the following day, with nominations open from 31 October to 4 November. Balloting would begin on 17 November, and {{the announcement of the}} new leader would occur on 13 December. Sarwar said that voting would be held using the three-tier electoral college, in which three groups – individual party members, parliamentarians, and affiliated bodies such as trade unions – each make up a third of the electorate. Plans to change Scottish Labour's electoral system to a one-person, one-vote ballot like that of the UK Labour Party were under review {{at the time of the}} leadership contest, but as forging ahead with these changes before the election of a new Scottish leader would delay the process, the decision was taken to use the existing method instead. Explaining this decision on the day the contest was announced, Sarwar told BBC News, [...] "We have had unanimous agreement to get the balance <b>right</b> <b>between</b> moving quickly to elect a new leader and also allowing a period of time to have an open, frank and honest debate about the future direction of the Scottish Labour party." [...] The deputy leadership contest followed the same timetable after Sarwar relinquished that role.|$|E
