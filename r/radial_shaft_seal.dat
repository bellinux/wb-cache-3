40|$|Reducing {{friction}} and thereby saving energy is {{of special interest}} for several industries like automotive, wind energy and any other section using elastomeric components, for example sealing rings. Unpredictable, deficient lubrication can occur and damage the sealing. Applying a plasma polymeric coating on elastomers the friction can be reduced. Four elastomer types (acrylic rubber, fluoric rubber and two different nitrile butadiene rubbers) were investigated each with and without plasma polymeric coating. The experiments were performed on coated and uncoated flat elastomer plates and the friction reduction was measured using a Uni-Kurzfassungversal Material Tester (UMT 3) system with oscillating Pin-on-plate contact geometry. The face of a cylindric wheel bearing with 6 mm in diameter was used as counterpart. The contact geometry was chosen due to the differentiability of lubricants in oscillating tests {{as well as the}} 104 times bigger contact area compared with the sealing lip of a <b>radial</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing.</b> The tribological tests were done under ambient conditions with a velocity of 200 mm/s and a stroke length of 11 mm. The used normal force of 10. 6 N represents an initial contact pressure of 0. 5 MPa. The tests were performed using different small amounts of fully formulated gear oil down to avoiding lubricants to demonstrate the effect of lubrication deficiency. The coated elastomers showed a reduced friction compared to the uncoated ones. Ifa coating was applied to the elastomers the measurements without any lubrication showed the lowest friction. Friction coefficients down to 0. 17 were achieved. Compared to 0. 48 for the dry measurement with uncoated substrate, a friction reduction of 65 % was reached. This demonstrates emergency running properties for plasmapolymeric coated components. For the lubricated measurements differences between the different lubrications appeared. The plasmapolymeric coating and therewith the friction reduction is available at low costs using a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique (PECVD). With PECVD it is easily possible to apply coatings on complex 3 D-geometrieslike sealing rings.

40|$|Die Standardlösung zur Abdichtung von Wellen im Maschinenbau sind Radial-Wellendichtringe (RWDR) aus Elastomeren. Allerdings stoßen Elastomer-Werkstoffe in vielen Anwendungen an ihre Belastungsgrenzen. Durch Einsatz von PTFE-Compounds als Dichtungswerkstoff können die Einschränkungen von Elastomeren weitgehend überwunden werden. Daher werden in der Dichtungstechnik immer häufiger Manschettendichtungen aus PTFE-Compounds (PTFE-MD) eingesetzt. Im Gegensatz zu Elastomer-RWDR sind bei PTFE-MD Rückförderstrukturen (RS) erforderlich, um die dynamische Dichtheit zu gewährleisten. Für Anwendungen mit festgelegter Drehrichtung der Welle gehören PTFE-MD mit Spiralrille zum bewährten Stand der Technik. Die Spiralrille als RS ist aber nur für eine Drehrichtung der Welle geeignet. Bei wechselnder Wellendrehrichtung werden andere RS verwendet. Es gibt zwar bereits funktionierende PTFE-MD mit RS für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, allerdings sind diese noch im Erforschungsstadium und weisen Optimierungspotenziale auf. Trotz des hohen potenziellen Nutzens für Dichtungsanwender durch die Verfügbarkeit von optimierten PTFE-MD mit RS, insbesondere für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, gibt es kaum Fortschritte seitens der Dichtungshersteller. Dies liegt im Wesentlichen daran, dass die entsprechenden Funktionsmechanismen nicht hinreichend bekannt sind. Ohne Kenntnis der genauen Funktionsmechanismen ist eine gezielte Optimierung nicht möglich. Daher muss mit hohem experimentellem Aufwand durch „Versuch und Irrtum“ optimiert werden. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es einen Beitrag zum besseren Verständnis der dynamischen Funktionsmechanismen von PTFE-MD mit RS, insbesondere für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, zu leisten. Dabei liegt das Hauptaugenmerk der Arbeit auf der numerischen Untersuchung der nachfolgenden Zusammenhänge. • Analyse des Strömungsverlaufs und der Druckverteilung um RS und im Dichtspalt. Dies dient einem besseren Verständnis der Vorgänge im Bereich des Dichtspalts. • Untersuchung unterschiedlicher Einflüsse auf das Umlenk- und Fördervermögen von RS. Ziel ist dabei die Identifikation von relevanten Einflussgrößen auf das Fördervermögen von PTFE-MD mit RS. • Analyse des Förderverhaltens durch den hydrodynamischen Dichtspalt und durch lokale Erhöhungen des Dichtspalts. • Betrachtung der Einflüsse der Dichtspaltgeometrie auf den Förderwert einer PTFE-MD mit RS. • Untersuchung der Auswirkungen von Geometrievariationen am Übergang einer RS in den geschlossenen Ring auf das Druckaufbauvermögen und damit auch indirekt auf das Fördervermögen von PTFE-MD mit RS. Durch ein besseres Verständnis der obigen Zusammenhänge können die dynamischen Funktionsmechanismen von PTFE-MD mit RS besser nachvollzogen werden. Hieraus lassen sich besonders wirkungsvolle Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung des Fördervermögens und damit der dynamischen Dichtsicherheit von PTFE-MD mit RS ableiten. Damit ist eine effektivere Optimierung möglich, wodurch der experimentelle Aufwand bei der Weiterentwicklung von PTFE-MD mit RS reduziert werden kann. The common {{solution}} for <b>sealing</b> <b>shafts</b> {{in mechanical engineering}} is the usage of <b>radial</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> made of elastomers. However elastomers encounter load limits in many applications. Through the application of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) compounds as sealing material, the limitations of elastomers can be largely overcome. Therefore the usage of lip seals made of PTFE compounds is becoming more common in sealing technology. In contrast to the elastomeric <b>radial</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> PTFE lip seals require special pumping structures to ensure their dynamic tightness. For applications with a fixed direction of shaft rotation PTFE lip seals with a spiral groove as pumping structure are established as state of the art. The spiral groove as pumping structure is only suitable for one direction of shaft rotation. For alternating directions of shaft rotation other pumping structures are used. Although functioning PTFE lip seals with pumping structures for both directions of shaft rotation are already in existence, these {{are still in the}} research stage and there is potential for optimization. Despite the high potential benefit for users through the availability of optimized PTFE lip seals with pumping structures, particularly for both directions of shaft rotation, there is little progress by the seal manufacturers. The main reason for lack in progress is deficient knowledge about the functional mechanisms of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures. Without knowing the exact functional mechanisms targeted optimization is hardly possible. Therefore optimization of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures requires high experimental effort and is accomplished by "trial and error". The aim of this thesis is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the dynamic functional mechanisms of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures, particularly for both directions of shaft rotation. The focus of this thesis is the numerical investigation of the following topics. • Analysis of the flow pattern and pressure distribution around pumping structures and in the sealing gap. This serves a better understanding of the processes in the region of the sealing gap. • Investigation of various influences on the deflection and pumping ability of pumping structures. The objective is to identify the relevant parameters for the pumping ability of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures. • Analysis of the pumping behaviour through the hydrodynamic sealing gap and through local elevations of the sealing gap. • Exploration of the influences of the sealing gap geometry on the pumping ability of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures. • Investigation of the effects of geometry variations in the transitional area between pumping structures and the continuously closes ring, which is necessary for static tightness. The geometry of this area is crucial for pressure build-up and thus indirectly for the pumping ability of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures. Through a better understanding of the above topics, the dynamic functional mechanisms of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures are described more accurately than before. This allows to identify especially effective measures to improve the pumping ability and thus the dynamic sealing reliability of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures. The mentioned measures imply a more efficient optimization, whereby the experimental effort in the advancement of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures can be significantly reduced...|$|R

40|$|The use of rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> made of PTFE {{material}} is ever increasing in the sealing of moving machine elements {{as a consequence}} of their high thermal and chemical resistance. Primarily in the sector of pressure-loadable rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals,</b> there is a high development demand. High circumferential velocity and high pressure of the liquid to be sealed make the use of elastomer seals impossible. A promising alternative is presented by PTFE rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals.</b> The relieved rotary <b>shaft</b> lip <b>seal</b> represents a special design among PTFE rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals.</b> Not relying on thermal resistance of the PTFE material alone, the relieved rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> as far as possible reduces the heat generating frictional moment for the permissible pressure range of the liquid to be sealed. Besides a high relative velocity at the sealing edge, thus, at the same time, high pressure of the liquid to be sealed is possible. Within the scope of this report, a contribution was made to the optimization of the relieved rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seal.</b> Earlier designs of the relieved rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seal,</b> similar to other commercially available rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals,</b> sometimes exhibited temporary surge-like leakages, the cause of which is the thermal expansion of the PTFE material.

In this way, the plastic memory effect, the temperature-dependent re-deformation capability of pre-deformed workpieces, proved to be a helpful measure against thermal expansion. (orig.

In our clinical experience, {{there are no}} previously reported radiographic parameters that are universally predictive of DRUJ insta-bility following <b>radial</b> <b>shaft</b> fracture. Materials and methods Fifty consecutive patients, ages 20 – 79 years, with unilateral <b>radial</b> <b>shaft</b> fractures and possible associated DRUJ injury were retrospectively identified over a 5 -year period. Distance from radial carpal joint (RCJ) to fracture proportional to <b>radial</b> <b>shaft</b> length, ulnar variance, and ulnar styloid fractures were correlated with DRUJ instability after surgical treatment. Results Twenty patients had persistent DRUJ incongru-ence/instability following fracture fixation. As a proportion of radial length, {{the distance from the}} RCJ to the fracture line did not significantly differ between those with persis-tent DRUJ instability and those without (p = 0. 34). The average initial ulnar variance was 5. 5 mm (range 2 – 12 mm, SD = 3. 2) in patients with DRUJ instability and 3. 8 mm (range 0 – 11 mm, SD = 3. 5) in patients without. Only 4 / 20 patients (20 %) with DRUJ instability had nor-mal ulnar variance (- 2 to? 2 mm) versus 15 / 30 (50 %) patients without (p = 0. 041).

30|$|Galeazzi {{fractures}} are fractures of the <b>radial</b> <b>shaft</b> with concomitant distal radial ulnar joint (DRUJ) dislocation [1 – 3]. Previous {{studies have}} shown {{a relationship between the}} fracture distance from the radiocarpal joint and associated DRUJ injury [4]. One paper found that fractures 7.5  cm or more from the wrist are usually not associated with a DRUJ injury [4]. However, the absolute number of 7.5  cm {{does not take into account}} the variations in the size of the patient’s radius or where in relation to the radial bow a concomitant DRUJ dislocation will occur, as 7.5  cm is not proportionalized to variation in <b>radial</b> <b>shaft</b> length. Recently, Korompilias et al. [5] found that fractures located in the distal third of the radius were most likely to have DRUJ instability. Still, isolated distal radius fractures are far more common than Galeazzi fractures [6], decreasing the utility of using the distal third location to predict DRUJ instability. In our clinical experience, the currently reported parameters for DRUJ instability following <b>radial</b> <b>shaft</b> fracture are not universally predictive. The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify radiographic features of <b>radial</b> <b>shaft</b> fractures that could predict concomitant DRUJ dislocation after plate fixation of the radius.|$|R

Based on data collected during the disassembly of these five engines, the consequences of propellant leakage across the ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> {{can be divided into}} four primary areas of concern: Damage to the ball-valve pinion shafts, damage to sleeved bearings inside the ball-valve and actuator assemblies, degradation of the synthetic rubber o-rings used in the actuator assemblies, and corrosion and degradation to the interior of the actuator assemblies.

This potential pressure range for the ball-valve cavities greatly exceeds the acceptance leakage test pressure of 332 psia. Since redesign and replacement of the ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> is unlikely, the near term solution to prevent damage that occurs from shaft-seal leakage is to implement a routine overhaul and maintenance program for engines in the fleet.
