5|$|With her <b>reconditioning</b> complete, West Cheswald {{arrived in}} New York from Baltimore on 23 March. Although {{she may have}} been {{scheduled}} to begin her African service as early as 29 March, she sailed from New York on 11 April for the Cape Verde Islands, and from there, to Cape Town, where she arrived on 15 May. Beginning the next day, West Cheswald visited Port Elizabeth, East London, Durban, Mombasa, Tanga, and Zanzibar through 11 June. She returned to Tanga, then sailed from Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar and back on 23 and 24 June. She next made her way to Lourenço Marques, where she arrived on 3 July. From Lourenço Marques, she sailed back to Durban and Cape Town, before she began her transatlantic journey to Trinidad on 18 July. After calling at that Caribbean port, she returned to New York to complete her first circuit on 18 August.|$|E

25|$|After the war, New York's <b>reconditioning</b> {{included}} {{removal of}} a mast. She resumed her passenger service in 1920 and remained with the American Line for nine months until she was sold to the Polish Navigation Company. After one voyage, her new owner went bankrupt and New York was seized by the creditors who sold her to the Irish American Line in 1922. She was then sold to the United Transatlantic Line and again to the American Black Sea Line. Her last Atlantic crossing was on 10 June 1922 from New York to Naples and Constantinople. Later that year, she was sold for scrap.|$|E

Although the machine was never developed commercially, it is interesting as a predecessor to the later magnetic tape recorder, which it resembles in general design. The tapes, when later examined {{at one of the}} Smithsonian Institution's depositories, had become brittle, the heavy paper reels had warped, and the machine's playback head was missing. Otherwise, with some <b>reconditioning</b> the machine could be put back into working order.|$|E

The {{process of}} remanufacturing is attractive economically and environmentally for both manufacturers and consumers. It {{is important to}} properly use <b>reconditioned</b> parts in a production plan based on their availability and production costs. A mathematical model is derived to find the cost-optimal production strategy that incorporates <b>reconditioned</b> components in the manufacturing effort. New and <b>reconditioned</b> parts are used to carry out replacements upon failure under an unlimited free replacement warranty policy. Key production decisions, such as when remanufacturing should commence, how long the warranty period should be, and how many returned parts should be <b>reconditioned</b> are answered. The availability of <b>reconditioned</b> parts and their discounted costs are incorporated in the model. Interactions between these decisions and their impacts on the manufacturing system and the consumer are investigated. A case study on aircraft rotable spare parts will be presented...|$|R

It {{was decided}} to move the engine to a new location approximately 150 yards west of its old spot, near the front of the Reserve building. The Pine Bluff Jaycees spearheaded the drive to build a green and white steel shed at the new location, while the move and <b>reconditioning</b> was being coordinated by members of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and Cotton Belt employees. Several civic organizations talked of undertaking the project of restoring the engine to better condition, only to find out that such a project required technical know-how that only railmen possessed.

25|$|Unlike {{many of her}} contemporaries however, West Cressey was {{to escape}} the scrap merchants' yard, and {{following}} the outbreak of World War II in 1939, steadily mounting losses of merchant ships to U-boats revived the demand for shipping tonnage. In order to help meet this demand, the successor to the USSB, the Maritime Commission, {{in addition to its}} orders for new tonnage, implemented a <b>reconditioning</b> program for older ships previously laid up. West Cressey became one of the ships so reconditioned, and in March 1941 she was placed back into service with the Grace Line for a monthly charter price of $16,486. Following this revival of fortune, West Cressey appears to have been employed {{for the next few months}} in a shuttle service between Los Angeles and Honolulu.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of a {{petroleum}} shortage (see peak oil for global concerns), organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields equal to or higher than those available from conventional farming. In the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs, Cuba made use of mostly organic practices, including biopesticides, plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices, to feed its populace. However, organic farming may be more labor-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas. The <b>reconditioning</b> of soil to restore organic matter lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques is important to provide a reservoir of plant-available nutrients, to maintain texture, and to minimize erosion.|$|E

25|$|Some of the fort's {{armament}} {{was removed}} {{under the terms}} of the 25 June 1940 armistice, but the ouvrage was maintained by French forces through the war, albeit in a militarily decommissioned capacity. l"Agaisen was occupied by German forces after their withdrawal from the war in 1943, remaining until the allied invasion of Southern France in 1944. The Germans fired on advancing American forces with the 75mm turret in October, abandoning the position on October 28, 1944 after sabotaging some of the equipment. The American 442nd Infantry Regiment, composed of mostly Japanese-American soldiers, occupied the site in November 1944. During fighting around Authion in April 1945 the 75mm turrets of l'Agaisen and Monte Grosso were used in support of American and French forces in the area. An abundance of French 75mm ammunition, incompatible with American 76mm guns, encouraged the <b>reconditioning</b> and used of the turret guns.|$|E
25|$|The twenty destroyers {{that the}} Navy was to {{transfer}} under the 1924 budget legislation included {{some of the}} Navy's oldest destroyers, which had been built between 1910 and 1916 and seen service in World War I. They had been stored at the Philadelphia Navy Yard {{since the end of}} the war without extensive preservation and were not ready for immediate service. Boilers, turbines, condensers and auxiliary machinery had to be inspected and reconditioned where necessary. The 3-inch gun batteries, torpedo tubes and depth charge racks were deemed unnecessary for the prohibition mission and were removed and a one pounder was mounted forward to fire a warning shot at boats that might attempt to flee a boarding. Much of the <b>reconditioning</b> work was done by newly graduated recruits and the work went slow; the first destroyer out of the yard was not ready until late summer and the last was not commissioned until 1925.|$|E
25|$|The firebox {{was to be}} {{completely}} replaced, however the dies and jigs used to press the boiler metal had been scrapped, so the old firebox {{was used as a}} template. The new firebox had a different shape and this reduced the boiler pressure from 245 psi to 215 psi. It was decided to weld the new firebox and some conservative engineers were sceptical as to whether this would work. Repairs and <b>reconditioning</b> of many other components were also carried out. The tender tank was so rusted, it needed to be replaced. The new tank was welded rather than riveted and this resulted in a sleek, plain tender. On 8 November 1986 a fire was lit for the first time. By 10 November 3801 was running around nearby sidings. More short trials followed and on 15 November 3801 was handed over and hauled a train to Maitland. More trial runs followed and on 19 November 1986, 3801 headed from Newcastle to a grand ball on the concourse of Sydney's Central station.|$|E
