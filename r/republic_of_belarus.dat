After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko. Nevertheless, international organizations and many Western countries do not recognize the current parliament given {{the way it was}} formed. At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading in the Belarusian ruble, which led to a collapse {{in the value of the}} currency.

The decision on the participation of Argentina was troubled because of Soviet opposition to Argentina membership, arguing that Argentina had supported the Axis Powers during the war. Several Latin American countries opposed the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>Belarus</b> and Ukraine unless Argentina was admitted. In the end, Argentina {{was admitted to the}} conference with support from the United States and the desire for the participation of the Soviet Union at the conference was maintained.|$|R

5|$|In 1990, Lukashenko {{was elected}} Deputy to the Supreme Council of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belarus.</b> He {{was the only}} deputy of the Belarusian {{parliament}} who voted against ratification of the December 1991 agreement that dissolved the Soviet Union {{and set up the}} Commonwealth of Independent States. Having acquired a reputation as an eloquent opponent of corruption, Lukashenko was elected in April 1993 to serve as the interim chairman of the anti-corruption committee of the Belarusian parliament. In late 1993 he accused 70 senior government officials, including the Supreme Soviet chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and prime minister Vyacheslav Kebich, of corruption including stealing state funds for personal purposes. While the charges were never fully proven against him, Shushkevich resigned his chairmanship due to the embarrassment of the series of events and losing a vote of no-confidence. He served in that position until July 1994.|$|E
5|$|To {{amend the}} Constitution, {{one of two}} things must happen before the National Assembly can {{consider}} the measure: The president must suggest the change, or 150,000 eligible voters must send a petition to the National Assembly. Both chambers of the National Assembly must discuss the proposed amendments for a minimum of three months. Two conditions can prevent a discussion from taking place: Either there is a state of emergency, or there are less than six months in the current term of the House of Representatives. In order for an amendment to take effect, it must be approved by either two-thirds of both chambers of the National Assembly or a simple majority of the voting population of Belarus in a national referendum. The only restriction is that Sections One, Two, Four and Eight can only be changed by national referendum. Rules for conducting a national referendum are enumerated in Chapters 22 through 25 of the Electoral Code of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belarus.</b> Since the original adoption of the Constitution in 1994, it has been amended twice; once in 1996 and once in 2004.|$|E

40|$|Master’s thesis Belarus’s National Narratives and Representation of the Grand Duchy <b>of</b> Lithuania in <b>Belarus’s</b> History Textbooks in its {{theoretical}} framework excessively {{relies on the}} discussion of the existing approaches towards the study of nationalism such as the perennialist, the modernist/constructivist and the ethno-symbolist. The ethnosymbolist approach by Anthony D. Smith, however, is chosen as the most appropriate for the empirical case <b>of</b> <b>Belarus’s</b> nation-building process and therefore, its ability to explain different expressions <b>of</b> <b>Belarus’s</b> national narratives is emphasized. The thesis combines the aforementioned {{theoretical framework}} with an empirical discussion <b>of</b> <b>Belarus’s</b> post-independence nation-building process in order to explain the peculiarity <b>of</b> the <b>Belarus’s</b> case in which the official national narrative coexists with the alternative national narrative in Belarus’s public sphere. The research question, however, is centered on the problem <b>of</b> the <b>Belarus’s</b> national narrative, as outlined in Belarus’s history textbooks, and its representation of Lithuania with regard to the medieval past of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which is shared by the both modern <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belarus</b> and Lithuania. With the analysis of history textbooks, the thesis responds to concerns of some Lithuanian historians and answers the question whether the Belarus’s national narrative and the representation of Lithuania presented in the textbooks are contesting and “rewriting” the Lithuanian past in terms of their input in the creation and maintenance of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the mid-thirteenth century until the late eighteenth century. The aforementioned research provides an unprecedented analysis <b>of</b> <b>Belarus’s</b> history textbooks in regard to their representation of another national group during the particular period of the shared medieval past...|$|R
