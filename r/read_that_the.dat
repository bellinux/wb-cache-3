5|$|The Canadian {{embassy in}} Moscow {{learned of the}} Soviets' {{interest}} in a series initially through reading {{an article in the}} Soviet Izvestia newspaper in the winter of 1971–1972. Diplomat Gary Smith, responsible for sport and cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union, <b>read</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Soviets were looking for a new challenge in ice hockey. Smith met with Izvestia sports editor Boris Fedosov initially, then followed up with a meeting with Soviet hockey boss Andrei Starovoitov. The Soviets divulged that they were ready to play in a series between its national team and Canadian professionals. After the meetings, Canadian ambassador Robert Ford passed the matter to Ottawa to negotiate a series and Hockey Canada was given the task to nail down the terms for a series.|$|E

For instance in early Rajput (also called Rajasthani) paintings, {{the only way to}} <b>read</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> painting is a night scene is through the presence of torches or candles. Later in the Rajput period, both somewhat influenced by Western art, night scenes were painted dramatically with shadows and Mughal paintings used chiaroscuro for shading.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} of perestroika and glasnost, the Soviet historiography began to write new views of its history. Rendition of Winter War studies had its {{breakthrough}} when the Soviet historian Mikhail Semiryaga wrote an article for the weekly magazine Ogoniok in 1989. It {{was the first time}} the public <b>read</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Winter War was a real war, not just a conflict, and that the Soviet government had had to deploy a large number of men and amount of matériel. Furthermore, Semiryaga wrote that the Soviets began their troop deployments in the spring of 1939. Later he wrote an article in which he revealed that the goal of the Red Army was not just to secure Leningrad, but to conquer the whole of Finland.|$|E
25|$|Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania, who {{had just}} part by part {{inherited}} the previously internally partitioned duchy to become her sole ruler in 1625, issued a paper called Dreijährige Drangsal ("three years of distress") after the Swedish take-over, which <b>read</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> capitulation in Franzburg had been forced upon him by the military. At the same time, {{he wrote a letter}} to the Holy Roman Emperor apologizing for the Swedish alliance, saying he had no choice but to obey Swedish demands, and included a passage in the Treaty of Stettin stating the alliance be for the empire's best. Bogislaw did not survive the war: He died without issue in 1637, terminating some 500 years of rulership of the House of Pomerania.|$|E

Bunker evidently stuck to the original formula and stressed that if only Faisal would halt his aid to the royalists, the US would be able pressure Nasser to withdraw. Faisal eventually accepted the offer, and Bunker went on to meet with Nasser in Beirut, where the Egyptian President repeated the assurance he had given Bunche.|$|E

500|$|After {{the passing}} of the Representation of the People Act 1918, in which some women within the United Kingdom were first given the right to vote, Barrett busied herself in {{continuing}} the fight for full emancipation. When full voting rights were won in 1928 she helped raise funds for commemorations and was an important figure in raising the money needed to erect a statue of Emmeline Pankhurst in Victoria Tower Gardens, near the Palace of Westminster in London. Barrett understood the international connections of suffrage and contacted important Canadian and American campaigners for financial support. In Barrett's obituary in the Women's Bulletin it <b>read</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> raising of the statue [...] "...stands as a permanent memorial to Rachel's organising ability."

5000|$|Inside the minarets are carved cartouches {{signed and}} dated by the {{architect}} upon the completion of each. This is particularly rare; it is very uncommon for an architect to leave his mark on a building in this era. <b>The</b> eastern minaret <b>reads</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "ma'dhana" [...] (or minaret) was built by Muhammad Ibn al-Qazzaz and was finished in August 1419.

Scholars are unsure as to why two different words for minaret were used in each inscription, and it remains a small mystery of the building. There was also a third minaret at the West portal to the street, but it fell into disrepair and was never rebuilt.|$|R
