5|$|When {{several of}} the {{fuselage}} alloys were discovered to be vulnerable to weakening via metal fatigue, a detailed <b>routine</b> <b>inspection</b> process was introduced. As well as thorough visual inspections of the outer skin, mandatory structural sampling was routinely conducted by both civil and military Comet operators. The need to inspect areas not easily viewable by the naked eye led {{to the introduction of}} widespread radiography examination in aviation; this also had the advantage of detecting cracks and flaws too small to be seen otherwise.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1999, two Chinooks of No. 27 Squadron left base at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, {{carrying}} paratroopers to join NATO forces {{serving in}} the Balkans; six more arrived the following week in Kosovo to support operations such as casualty evacuations and transporting vital supplies. On 12 June 1999, waves of Chinooks, escorted by Westland Lynx and American AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, were used to rapidly deploy British infantry forces into Kosovo {{as a part of}} NATO's first phase of deployment. On 10 August 1999 hundreds of Chinooks around the world, including those used by the British armed forces, were grounded due to cracking discovered in the landing gear of a British helicopter during <b>routine</b> <b>inspection.</b>|$|E

When this scandal becomes public, Erica is out of state, and in order to delay Erica from returning quickly and make a counter-statement to the scandal, David has someone sabotage the plane – expecting the pilot to run <b>routine</b> <b>inspection</b> before take-off. Erica, {{in a hurry to get}} back to Pine Valley, insists the pilot take off without the pre-flight inspection or filing a flight plan.|$|E
25|$|The Puma {{is readily}} air-transportable by {{tactical}} airlift aircraft {{such as the}} Transall C-160 and the Lockheed C-130 Hercules; the main rotor, landing gear, and tailboom are all detachable to lower space requirements. Ease of maintenance {{was one of the}} objectives pursued in the Puma's design; many of the components and systems that would require <b>routine</b> <b>inspection</b> were positioned to be visible from ground level, use of life-limited components was minimised, and key areas of the mechanical systems were designed to be readily accessed. The Puma is also capable of operating at nighttime, in inhospitable flying conditions, or {{in a wide range of}} climates from Arctic to desert environments.|$|E
25|$|To leave a {{personal}} {{account of his}} experiences for his children and also to maintain his faculties amid the desolate Sarozek, Abutalip takes to writing about his time as a prisoner of war, his escape, and fighting for the partisans; he also records the various legends told to him by Yedigei. Unfortunately for him, these activities are discovered during a <b>routine</b> <b>inspection</b> of the junction and reported to higher authorities. The denizens of Boranly-Burannyi and Abutalip are interrogated by the tyrannical Tansykbaev, and he is deemed counterrevolutionary. In due Soviet process, he is taken away and unheard of for a long time. Later, Kazangap travels to the nearby Kumbel' to visit his son. There he finds a letter meant to inform Zaripa of Abutalip's death, but thinks it best to merely {{tell her that she}} has a letter rather to inform her of its contents. Yedigei later accompanies Zaripa to Kumbel' in order to receive the letter; coincidentally, Joseph Stalin dies on the same day, but Zaripa was too overcome with grief to pay notice to the news.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, Koeberg started {{experiencing}} numerous technical difficulties. On 11 November 2005, a fault on {{a transmission}} busbar caused the reactor to go into safe mode, cutting supply {{to most of the}} Western Cape for about two hours. On 16 November a fire under a 400 kV transmission line caused the line to trip, causing severe voltage dips which resulted in Koeberg once again shutting down. Various parts of the Cape were left without electricity for hours at a time. On the evening of 23 November, a <b>routine</b> <b>inspection</b> of the backup safety system revealed a below-spec concentration of an important chemical, resulting in a controlled shutdown of the reactor. Due to the sufficiency of backup supply, major power cuts were not experienced until Friday 25 November, when the backup capacity began running out. At this point, rotational load shedding was employed, with customers being switched off in stages for most of the day. Koeberg was re-synchronised to the national grid on Saturday 26 November.|$|E

50|$|On 8 April 2015, Sabra {{recalled}} 30,000 {{cases of}} its classic hummus after a tub in Michigan {{tested positive for}} Listeria. Inspectors with the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) learned of the possible contamination by L. monocytogenes after <b>routine</b> <b>inspections</b> on March 30th at a Kroger in Port Huron, according to MDARD spokeswoman Jennifer Holton.|$|R
50|$|Ship traffic {{passing through}} the Bay can damage the anodes used in the Tube's {{cathodic}} protection system when dropping anchor. Since the anodes protrude from the filled trench surrounding the Tube, they are more vulnerable to damage. Marine traffic is restricted from dropping anchors when over the Tube, but BART conducts <b>routine</b> <b>inspections</b> for anode damage.|$|R
2500|$|Earlier {{this week}} a <b>routine</b> <b>inspection</b> discovers an {{overflowing}} tank which had leaked about 12,000 litres of highly contaminated water onto the ground. [...] The spill {{was caused by}} a valve that was left open by mistake. [...] Radiation readings of the ground nearby measure 230 MBq/L, including strontium-90.

2500|$|On April 30, 2010, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a {{subsidiary}} of Johnson and Johnson, voluntarily recalled 43 over-the-counter children's medicines, including Tylenol, Tylenol Plus, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl. The recall was conducted after a <b>routine</b> <b>inspection</b> at a manufacturing facility in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, United States revealed that some [...] "products may not fully meet the required manufacturing specifications". Affected products may contain a [...] "higher concentration of active ingredients" [...] or exhibit other manufacturing defects. Products shipped to Canada, Dominican Republic, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Fiji {{were included in the}} recall. In a statement, Johnson & Johnson said [...] "a comprehensive quality assessment across its manufacturing operations" [...] was underway.

2500|$|Streetcars {{remained}} the main form {{of public transportation}} for the city until {{the popularity of the}} automobile caused ridership to wane. With the improvement of local highways beginning before World War II, citizens were able to own more land and still be able to conveniently drive into the city to enjoy its benefits. [...] Aided by an anti-rail stance by the City of Cincinnati and suburbs such as Norwood, the streetcars were quickly phased out after the war in favor of buses and trolley buses, and on April 29, 1951, the last streetcars were retired. The Mount Adams Incline closed in 1948, when <b>routine</b> <b>inspection</b> in preparation for repairs revealed that the undergirding timbers were dangerously decayed. This was the death knell of the incline, following complaints that it was [...] "unsightly," [...] cost too much, caused roadblocks, and was rendered useless by the automobile. At the time it was closed, the Mount Adams Incline was Cincinnati's top tourist attraction.|$|E
50|$|The {{software}} and controls regulate equipment {{to run at}} the optimum speed that requires the least energy. They also ensure the consistency of quality, meaning less energy is wasted producing products that {{turn out to be}} defective, and they forecast when maintenance is needed so less time and energy is spent stopping and restarting equipment for <b>routine</b> <b>inspections.</b>|$|R
30|$|Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) {{created an}} {{integrated}} database that utilized pavement condition data, traffic data, pavement preservation planning data, and capital project planning data. This {{was used for}} projects prioritization of preservation and improvement projects. The maintenance data were also fused with pavement condition data to determine <b>routine</b> <b>inspections</b> and repairs on the state’s highway facilities (Rydholm et al. 2015).|$|R
50|$|While fatigue {{cracks of}} an {{acceptable}} length are normal in aircraft, {{they are usually}} found during <b>routine</b> <b>inspections</b> or stopped at a crack-arresting feature. Aircraft fly with acceptable cracks until they are repaired. The Tu-144 design was the opposite of standard practice, allowing {{a higher incidence of}} defects in the alloy structure, leading to crack formation and propagation to many metres.|$|R
2500|$|Homeschooling {{is legal}} in all provinces and territories in Canada {{and has been}} for 40 years. [...] The Ontario Education Act, for example, states in Section 21(2)(a) that [...] "A person is excused from {{attendance}} at school if [...] the person is receiving education elsewhere". [...] Canada is known as having some of the most comprehensive legal protections for homeschooling parents in the Americas. [...] Some provinces have implemented policies that require parents to notify school boards of their decision to homeschool. [...] Every province requires parents to notify the school system of their intent to withdraw their child from the public school system and to begin home education. [...] Five of ten provinces additionally require parents to submit a detailed curriculum to the state. [...] Seven of these provinces do not require the program to be monitored by the school board or other private school administrators, and only five provinces require <b>routine</b> <b>inspection</b> of home education. These policies, however, are not law; although Canadian legislators recognize the importance of state controls in the homeschooling environment, it is ultimately up to the parent to decide when and how to homeschool. [...] Despite a positive environment that supports and encourages alternatives to traditional schooling, it is estimated that less than [...]5% of Canadian families were homeschooling in 2015. [...] This number is probably inaccurate, however, as many parents do not report their decisions to homeschool.|$|E
