By U.S. law, the only limitation on that power is a <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> specific members of Congress within 48 hours after the beginning of military operations. Once proper legal notification is given to the required members of Congress, military action can continue and remain secret so long as the President judges it necessary to national security.|$|E

30|$|From {{the various}} events and Hackathons, several {{third-party}} applications have emerged that combine tourism data with other data sources or use if for particular purposes. One such example is an application that allows tourists {{who can play}} a music instrument to discover other musicians they can play with while visiting another city. The first application we became aware of was the Spot in series, that was initially available for Helsinki, but today features versions for Amsterdam, Helsinki, Lamia and Lisbon, thanks to the CitySDK Tourism API. We currently know of about half-a-dozen applications and have been contacted by developers interested in creating new apps and students and professors interested in using the API in their projects or courses.

2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the trial, various {{movements}} have arisen {{for the creation of a}} new law, called [...] "Caylee's Law", that would impose stricter <b>requirements</b> on parents <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> law enforcement of the death or disappearance of a child. One such petition, circulated via Change.org, has gained nearly 1.3 million electronic signatures. In response to this and other petitions, lawmakers in four states—Florida, Oklahoma, New York, and West Virginia—have begun drafting versions of [...] "Caylee's Law". The law in Oklahoma would require a child's parent or guardian <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> police of a missing child within 24 hours, and would also stipulate a time frame for notification of the disappearance of a young child under the age of12. The Florida law would make it a felony if a parent or legal guardian fails to report a missing child in timely manner if they could have known the child would be in danger. The call for mandatory reporting laws has been criticized as being [...] "reactive, overly indiscriminating and even counterproductive". One critic noted the law could lead to overcompliance and false reports by parents wary of becoming suspects, wasting police resources and leading to legitimate abductions going uninvestigated during the critical first few hours. Additionally innocent people could get snared in the law for searching for a child instead of immediately calling police.|$|R

The Commission was requested to undertake a research study to examine the impacts of options for reforming Australia’s general consumer product safety system. The Commission’s final report recommends a new national approach is needed to improve Australia’s consumer product safety system. The adoption of a single national law and regulator, replacing the States and Territories authority, is recommended by the Commission as a key reform {{to create a more}} consistent and responsive consumer product protection system. The Commission has also called for the responsiveness of the system to be improved by: introducing a new <b>requirement</b> for suppliers <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> the regulator of products associated with serious injury or death; developing a nationally coordinated product hazard identification system; and improving the targeting and timeliness of standards-making processes. To address information gaps, the Commission has endorsed a number of initiatives including: a national internet based one-stop shop for business and consumer information; and a one-off base line research study into the incidence and costs of product-related accidents, and an analysis of their causes.

Only 11 either banned all forms of seclusion or restricted it to emergency threats of physical harm.

50|$|The major {{drawback}} to this service was {{the reliance on}} the phone company or vendor partner to manage (in most cases) the PBX or key telephone system. This resulted in a residual, recurring cost to customers. Over time, the PBX became more privatized, and internal staff members were hired to manage these systems. This was typically done by companies that could afford to bring this skill in-house and thereby reduce the <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> the phone company or their local PBX vendor each time a change was required in the system. This increasing privatization triggered {{the development of more}} powerful software that increased the usability and manageability of the system.|$|E

5000|$|Civil {{registration}} {{is the system}} by which a government records the vital events (births, marriages, and deaths) of its citizens and residents.

Second, the constituents of EuropeÂ’'s grain intervention enterprise receive exclusive and special rights to export grain.
