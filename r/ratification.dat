5|$|Article One {{came within}} one {{state of the}} number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to <b>ratification</b> early on, it has never received the approval of enough states {{to become part of}} the Constitution. As Congress did not attach a <b>ratification</b> time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. Since no state has approved it since 1792, <b>ratification</b> by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for the article to be adopted.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{favorable}} position {{toward the}} proposed federal constitution, Marshall {{was chosen as}} a delegate to the convention from Fayette County. On June 25, 1788, he joined Jefferson County delegates Robert Breckinridge and Rice Bullock in voting for <b>ratification.</b> Ten other Kentucky delegates opposed <b>ratification</b> and one abstained. The final convention vote was 8979 in favor of <b>ratification.</b> It was reported that even the Jefferson County delegates were beginning to waver in {{their commitment to the}} proposed constitution, but that Marshall steeled their resolve and also influenced several delegates from other parts of Virginia to favor it.|$|E
50|$|Sanitary {{conventions}} {{were also}} concluded between European states. A Soviet-Latvian sanitary convention was signed on 24 June 1922, for which <b>ratifications</b> were exchanged on 18 October 1923. A bilateral sanitary convention was concluded between {{the governments of}} Latvia and Poland on 7 July 1922, for which <b>ratifications</b> were exchanged on 7 April 1925. Another was concluded between the governments of Germany and Poland in Dresden on 18 December 1922, and entered into effect on 15 February 1923. Another one was signed between the governments of Poland and Romania on 20 December 1922. <b>Ratifications</b> were exchanged on 11 July 1923. The Polish government also concluded such a convention with the Soviet government on 7 February 1923, for which <b>ratifications</b> were exchanged on 8 January 1924. A sanitary convention was also concluded between the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia on 5 September 1925, for which <b>ratifications</b> were exchanged on 22 October 1926. A convention was signed between the governments of Germany and Latvia on 9 July 1926, for which <b>ratifications</b> were exchanged on 6 July 1927.|$|R
50|$|As {{far as the}} <b>ratifications</b> of Tennessee and West Virginia were concerned, {{the court}} remarked that the {{additional}} <b>ratifications</b> of Connecticut and Vermont after the proclamation of the amendment rendered the point moot, but the court also addressed {{the substance of the}} objection. The court found that as the Secretary of State had accepted the <b>ratifications</b> by the legislatures of the two states as valid, they were valid, effectively ruling the matter as non-justiciable.|$|R

5|$|On June 18, 1866, Congress {{adopted the}} Fourteenth Amendment, which {{guaranteed}} citizenship and equal {{protection under the}} laws regardless of race, {{and sent it to}} the states for <b>ratification.</b> After a bitter struggle that included attempted rescissions of <b>ratification</b> by two states, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted on July 28, 1868.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of Ohio and New Jersey {{has led some}} to question the validity of rescission of a <b>ratification.</b> The {{inclusion of}} Alabama and Georgia has called that conclusion into question.

5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} Bill of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for <b>ratification</b> applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following <b>ratification</b> of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E
5|$|Among the Virginia {{delegation}} to the House was James Madison, Patrick Henry's chief opponent in the Virginia <b>ratification</b> battle. In retaliation for Madison's victory in that battle at Virginia's <b>ratification</b> convention, Henry and other Anti-Federalists, who controlled the Virginia House of Delegates had gerrymandered a hostile district for Madison's planned congressional run and recruited Madison's future presidential successor, James Monroe, to oppose him. Madison defeated Monroe after offering a campaign pledge that he would introduce constitutional amendments comprising a Bill of Rights at the First Congress.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} not yet been {{approved}} by 11 of the 14 states, the <b>ratification</b> of Article One (ratified by 10) and Article Two (ratified by 6) remained incomplete. The <b>ratification</b> plateau they needed to reach soon rose to 12 of 15 states when Kentucky joined the Union (June 1, 1792). On June 27, 1792, the Kentucky General Assembly ratified all 12 amendments, however this action did not come to light until 1996.|$|E

5|$|Following Massachusetts' lead, the Federalist {{minorities}} in both Virginia and New York {{were able to}} obtain <b>ratification</b> in convention by linking <b>ratification</b> to recommended amendments. A committee of the Virginia convention headed by law professor George Wythe forwarded forty recommended amendments to Congress, twenty of which enumerated individual rights and another twenty of which enumerated states' rights. The latter amendments included limitations on federal powers to levy taxes and regulate trade.|$|E
5|$|For the {{constitution}} to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to <b>ratification</b> ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against <b>ratification</b> (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for {{the addition of a}} bill of rights. Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches.|$|E
