60|$|The {{practical}} conclusion {{from these}} premises {{is not difficult}} to draw. The authority which is most conversant with principles should be supreme over principles, while that which is most competent in details should have the details left to it. The principal business of the central authority should be to give instruction, of the local authority to apply it. Power may be localized, but knowledge, to be most useful, must be centralized; there must be somewhere a focus at which all its scattered rays are collected, that the broken and colored lights which exist elsewhere may find there what is necessary to complete and purify them. To every branch of local administration which affects the general interest there should be a corresponding central organ, either a minister, or some specially appointed functionary under him, even if that functionary does no more than collect information from all quarters, and bring the experience acquired in one locality to the knowledge of another where it is wanted. But there is also something more than this for the central authority to do. It ought to keep open a perpetual communication with the localities--informing itself by their experience, and them by its own; giving advice freely when asked, volunteering it when seen to be required; compelling publicity and recordation of proceedings, and enforcing obedience to every general law which the Legislature has laid down on the subject of local management. That some such laws ought to be laid down few are likely to deny. The localities may be allowed to mismanage their own interests, but not to prejudice those of others, nor violate those principles of justice between one person and another of which it is the duty of the state to maintain the rigid observance. If the local majority attempts to oppress the minority, or one class another, the state is bound to interpose. For example, all local rates ought to be voted exclusively by the local representative body; but that body, though elected solely by rate-payers, may raise its revenues by imposts of such a kind, or assess them in such a manner, as to throw an unjust share of the burden on the poor, the rich, or some particular class of the population: it is the duty, therefore, of the Legislature, while leaving the mere amount of the local taxes to the discretion of the local body, to lay down authoritatively the mode of taxation and <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> which alone the localities shall be permitted to use. Again, in the administration of public charity, the industry and morality of the whole laboring population depends, to a most serious extent, upon adherence to certain fixed principles in awarding relief. Though it belongs essentially to the local functionaries to determine who, according to those principles, is entitled to be relieved, the national Parliament is the proper authority to prescribe the principles themselves; and it would neglect a most important part of its duty if it did not, in a matter of such grave national concern, lay down imperative rules, and make effectual provision that those rules should not be departed from. What power of actual interference with the local administrators {{it may be necessary to}} retain, for the due enforcement of the laws, is a question of detail into which it would be useless to enter. The laws themselves will naturally define the penalties, and fix the mode of their enforcement. It may be requisite, to meet extreme cases, that the power of the central authority should extend to dissolving the local representative council or dismissing the local executive, but not to making new appointments or suspending the local institutions. Where Parliament has not interfered, neither ought any branch of the executive to interfere with authority; but as an adviser and critic, an enforcer of the laws, and a denouncer to Parliament or the local constituencies of conduct which it deems condemnable, the functions of the executive are of the greatest possible value.|$|E

40|$|Defect {{assessment}} procedures ensure the structural integrity of plant, which may contain complex defects. The present work addresses complex defects with re-entrant sectors, which develop from {{the interaction of}} two co-planar surface breaking defects in fatigue. Experimental studies show rapid fatigue growth and amplified crack driving forces in the re-entrant sector. This leads to the rapid evolution of the complex crack into a bounding semi-elliptical defect. Experiments involving ductile tearing of cracks with a re-entrant sector show that tearing initiates in the re-entrant sector and that the defect evolves into a bounding semi-elliptical defect. Cleavage failures of defects with re-entrant sectors indicate the re-characterisation procedure is only conservative after invoking constraint arguments. The study confirms the conservatism inherent in the re-characterisation <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> procedures, such as BS 7910 [1] and ASME Section XI [2] for complex defects extending by fatigue or ductile earing. A potentially non-conservative situation exists for defects with re-entrant sectors failing by cleavage at small fractions of the limit load...|$|E

In the context of SEM, the CFA is often called 'the measurement model', while the relations between the latent variables (with directed arrows) are called 'the structural model'.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple, {{practical}} but also realistic, methodology of multicriteria decision {{aid for the}} assessment of public investment projects which takes into account the uncertainty of projects' measures. It follows the general framework of the expected utility developed by von Neumann and Morgenstern and its operational modelling by an additive non-linear function proposed by Keeney and Raiffa. However, it builds upon the linear goal programming model of Jacquet-Lagrèze and Siskos which offers several convenient computational procedures for building non-linear (albeit, piecewise linear) partial utility functions reflecting, as well as possible, the decision-maker's preferences. In order to simplify as much as possible the process of decision making, the paper proposes an alternative method, named Quasi-UTA, whereby the decision maker chooses directly for each criterion a (piecewise linear) partial utility function with only two parameters. These are the respective relative weights and a curvature parameter that models risk aversion or proneness. The method substantially reduces the number of questions to be answered by the decision-maker. In a context of budget constraint, the paper seeks to calibrate the utility function in equivalent money value, and shows how to compute such a value in multicriteria analysis. Money valuation has the advantage of permitting the use of standard financial <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment.</b> The paper also shows how to compute the cost of a project's uncertainty, i. e. its risk premium, as proposed in the financial theory of risk. The method also suggests a procedure to generate and compute each criterion's random distribution as a triangular, rectangular or discrete function.

40|$|In 2011, school-based {{assessment}} (SBA, hereafter) {{was introduced}} into Malaysian {{public schools to}} enhance the assessment system. As {{key players in the}} teaching and learning process, teachers are required to equip themselves with good knowledge and understanding of assessment including SBA. Therefore, this study investigated the Science teachers' knowledge and understanding of assessment and the implementation of SBA in Malaysian Secondary Science classrooms. It also investigated the benefits of SBA and the challenges faced by teachers. The study involved a total of 66 lower secondary science teachers teaching at 6 secondary schools located in the district of Sri Aman in Sarawak. Data was collected using a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews with 6 teachers. The results obtained indicated that teachers possessed sufficient and a moderate level of knowledge and understanding of SBA in terms of definition and terminology of SBA and the implementation of SBA at the planning administering and scoring stage of assessment. However, teachers possessed limited knowledge with regards to general <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment.</b> Inferential statistics conducted using the independent-samples t-test further showed that Science teachers' overall knowledge and understanding of SBA is not influenced by gender, school locality or experience. Nevertheless, {{there was a significant difference}} in the knowledge and understanding of SBA in terms of definition, terminology and general rules of SBA between novice and experienced teachers. The experienced teachers also have a significantly better and higher level of knowledge on scoring and reporting SBA scores. Teachers also highlighted that SBA has actually helped them to improve on the student's learning and the teacher's competencies. Nevertheless the teachers stressed that SBA increased teacher's workload and they felt that time constraint was one of their major concerns. Taking into consideration these findings, and aligning them with the initiatives of the National Educational Blueprint, (NEB), teachers must be provided with sufficient training in general assessment. They must also be provided continuous professional development (CPD) so that they can be better informed and motivated to see the many benefits of SBA.

40|$|Although {{official}} on-the-ground {{environmental monitoring}} is absent {{over much of}} the world, many people living in these regions observe, manage, and protect their environment. The autonomous monitoring processes associated with these activities are seldom documented and appear poorly recognized by conservation professionals. We identified monitoring activities in three villages in the Mamberamo-Foja region (Mamberamo Regency) of Papua (Indonesian New Guinea). In each village we found evidence that local monitoring contributes to effective protection and deters unregulated exploitation. Although everyone gathers observations and shares information, there are also specific roles. For example, the Ijabait hereditary guardians live at strategic sites where they control access to resource-rich lakes and tributaries along the Tariku River. Often, monitoring is combined with and thus influences other activities: for example, hunting regularly includes areas judged vulnerable to incursions by neighboring communities. We identified various examples of community members intervening to prevent and deter outsiders from exploiting resources within their territories. Enforcement <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> and <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> resource status also help prevent local overexploitation within the communities. Clearly, local people are effective in protecting large areas in a relatively natural state. We discuss the value of these autonomous monitoring and protection processes, their neglect, and the need for explicit recognition by those concerned about these people and their environments, as well as about conservation. We highlight a potential "tragedy of the unseen sentinels" when effective local protection is undermined not because these local systems are invisible, but because no one recognizes what they see...|$|R

40|$|Lay {{perceptions}} of risk appear rooted more in heuristics than in reason. A major {{concern of the}} risk regulation literature is that such “error-strewn” perceptions may be replicated in policy, as governments respond to the (mis) fears of the citizenry. This has led many to advocate a relatively technocratic approach to regulating risk, characterized by high reliance on formal risk and cost-benefit analysis. However, through two studies of chemicals regulation, we show that the formal <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> risk is pervaded by {{its own set of}} heuristics. These include rules to categorize potential threats, define what constitutes valid data, guide causal inference, and to select and apply formal models. Some of these heuristics lay claim to theoretical or empirical justifications, others are more back-of-the-envelope calculations, while still more purport not to reflect some truth but simply to constrain discretion or perform a desk-clearing function. These heuristics can be understood as a way of authenticating or formalizing risk assessment as a scientific practice, representing a series <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> for bounding problems, collecting data, and interpreting evidence (a methodology). Heuristics are indispensable elements of induction. And so they are not problematic per se, but they can become so when treated as laws rather than as contingent and provisional rules. Pitfalls include the potential for systematic error, masking uncertainties, strategic manipulation, and entrenchment. Our central claim is that by studying the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> risk <b>assessment</b> qua <b>rules,</b> we develop a novel representation of the methods, conventions, and biases of the prior art...|$|R

40|$|Today in Russia, much {{attention}} {{is given to}} research and practical identification of the cultural landscape (CL) stability parameters that define its dependency {{on the character of}} the territorial land use. As a rule, these are projects of territorial and landscape planning (LP) aimed at <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> stability of the CL depending on the conditions of the social and natural environment, on the level of changes of its components, and on the direct relation with the nature and the type of natural resources management. This approach defines most fully conditions and the level of impact on the landscape. The paper discusses the main types of natural resource management of the CL. Residential areas are the most complex and multifunctional types of natural resource management. They are of the greatest interest to the research as an object of “co-creation of man and nature” [Sochava, 1978]. This is determined by an important role of residential areas with their infrastructure as a landscape reshaping element that influences the functioning and structure of the CL. Cities, suburbs and towns, as human environment, require a special attention in order to achieve an environmentally friendly and sustainable landscape. In the concept of LP, {{much attention}} is given to <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the natural components of the CL. As a <b>rule,</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> soil, climate (atmosphere), water, and landscape sensitivity and significance is conducted [Drozdov, 2006]. The selection <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> criteria varies depending on the natural resource management type. Obtained results are compared with parameters that are indicative for or specific to naturally occurring landscape. The crisis of environmental components makes LP the vitally necessary management instrument. The goals of landscape planning are broadly formulated—landscape planning should cover the entire territory of the country, should consider both natural and socio-economic factors, and should develop measures to prevent and control impacts on the landscape. </span...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a robotic {{prediction}} agent including a darkforest Go engine, a fuzzy markup language (FML) assessment engine, an FML-based decision support engine, and a robot engine for game of Go application. The knowledge base and <b>rule</b> base <b>of</b> FML <b>assessment</b> engine are constructed by referring {{the information from the}} darkforest Go engine located in NUTN and OPU, for example, the number of MCTS simulations and winning rate prediction. The proposed robotic prediction agent first retrieves the database of Go competition website, and then the FML assessment engine infers the winning possibility based on the information generated by darkforest Go engine. The FML-based decision support engine computes the winning possibility based on the partial game situation inferred by FML assessment engine. Finally, the robot engine combines with the human-friendly robot partner PALRO, produced by Fujisoft incorporated, to report the game situation to human Go players. Experimental results show that the FML-based prediction agent can work effectively.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{whether or not}} there are inherit flaws in Swedish legislation concerning psychiatric institutional care, or in the application of the act, which might lead to the failure <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law for the private citizen. Law (1991 : 1128) concerning psychiatric institutional care in certain instances (LPIC) aims to establish rules which will ensure <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law for the mentally ill in case of psychiatric institutional care. Despite this, there are legal cases which indicate that these rules, and their implications, are not always considered at the psychiatric wards. The questions at issues which this study aims to answer are thus: Are there any deficiencies concerning <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in LPIC 2 − 3 §§, 4 − 6 §§, 7 − 10 §§, 15 − 25 §§ and 32 − 33 §§ ? This section focuses on LPIC and its design. Whether or not the act adheres to <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is examined through a definition which has evolved through discussions of concept based in Peczeniks definition <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. The second question at issue is: Does The National Board of Health and Welfare activity supervision and the National Psychiatric Coordination inquiry point to any deficiencies in the application of the regulation that might negatively impact <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law? This section is based on the parts concerned with compulsory commitment in The National Board of Health and Welfare activity supervision and the National Psychiatric Coordination’s inquiry. The considerations <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in the application <b>of</b> the <b>rules</b> are based on the definition <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law derived from Annika Staaf’s viewpoints. This definition deals with the application <b>of</b> the <b>rules</b> concerning compulsory commitment. The third question at issue {{takes the form of a}} discussion dealing with the first two questions. The answer is thus based on the answers to the two opening questions and includes an extra focus placed on the historical heritage and the future psychiatric institutional care. To answer the questions at issue a traditional legal method will be used. This means that the law is determined by studying texts of law and preparatory work. Doctrine concerning compulsory psychiatric commitment is also used. To achieve a deeper understanding of the questions at issue concerning <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law that might arise in the usage of compulsory psychiatric commitment, a historical retrospect spanning the legislative development will be presented. The result produced by the analysis indicates that the legislation in accordance with the definition <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law based on Peczeniks definition in most cases can be considered to adhere to <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. On the other hand, the demand for necessity, which <b>rules</b> the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> compulsory psychiatric commitment, is found to be indeterminable. According to the inquiry this will in some cases lead to arbitrary and routine-like admissions, and in other cases lead to the patient being in bad condition at the time of admission. The patient will thereby find it difficult to gain any usefulness from the care given. The inquiry here points to local variation which leads to a non-existing predictability. The second question at issue, where Staaf’s definition <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is used, finds a somewhat higher number of deficiencies. I can in my paper thus determine that most of the deficiencies can be found in the application of the act. The gravest deficiency from a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law standpoint found by The National Board of Health and Welfare is the lack of local instructions regarding the monitoring of time limits during compulsory commitment. Based on these conclusions the paper’s question at issue is discussed in the last chapter. Like the National Psychiatric Coordination finds in its inquiry, this paper finds the answer to the question at issue to be that a reformation of the act is needed. In light of the historical exposition I find that new forms of care and methods of treatment have arisen since the conception of the act, which provides new possibilities for the compulsory psychiatric commitment...|$|R
