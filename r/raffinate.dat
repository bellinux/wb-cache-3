5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – URanium EXtraction) type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (<b>raffinate)</b> by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.|$|E

An ASPEN plus model was applied to minimise the energy demand for the product purification stages, which were identified as the point of highest energy consumption of the process owing to the high molar excess of methanol required for the process (40 : 1 molar excess, 1. 45 : 1 on a mass basis). Vacuum distillation followed by a small rectification column was identified as the optimum solution. The determination of the energy demand of the plant revealed the economic viability of the process {{as far as the}} energy consumption is concerned. The plant could be operated at full conversion of the feed (not <b>raffinated</b> rapeseed oil). The catalyst incorporated into the plant had been selected out {{of a large number of}} possible formulations through a screening procedure applying tricaprin as model substance. γ-Al 2 O 3 modified by acid treatment and La 2 O 3 supported by γ-Al 2 O 3 were identified as most promising candidates. The stability of these formulations was proven through long term stability tests.

40|$|The Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP), {{located at}} the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), {{formerly}} reprocessed spent nuclear fuel to recover fissionable uranium. The radioactive <b>raffinates</b> from the solvent extraction uranium recovery processes were converted to granular solids (calcine) in a high temperature fluidized bed. A secondary liquid waste stream was generated {{during the course of}} reprocessing, primarily from equipment decontamination between campaigns and solvent wash activities. This acidic tank waste cannot be directly calcined due to the high sodium content and has historically been blended with reprocessing <b>raffinates</b> or non-radioactive aluminum nitrate prior to calcination. Fuel reprocessing activities are no longer being performed at the ICPP, thereby eliminating the option of waste blending to deplete the waste inventory. Currently, approximately 5. 7 million liters of high-activity waste are temporarily stored at the ICPP in large underground stainless-steel tanks. The United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare filed a Notice of Noncompliance in 1992 contending some of the underground waste storage tanks do not meet secondary containment. As part of a 1995 agreement between the State of Idaho, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Navy, the waste must be removed from the tanks by 2012. Treatment of the tank waste inventories by partitioning the radionuclides and immobilizing the resulting high-activity and low-activity waste streams is currently under evaluation.

40|$|Dissolved Nitrogen Predispersed Solvent Extraction (DNPDSE) is a {{new method}} devised for {{improving}} the performance of equipment utilized in the solvent extraction (SX) method, especially for dilute solutions. In this method, for mixing the two phases, bubble dispersion of the organic phase (colloidal gas aphrons [CGAs]) is used instead of its drop dispersion in the aqueous phase. Through increased contact area and enhanced buoyancy force of organic phase, this performance mode leads to more satisfactory phase disengagement, less extraction time and more recovery of metal ions in high aqueous/organic (A/O) ratios. The results of experiments conducted on dilute (128 mg Cu/l) and dense (2000 mg Cu/l) synthetic solutions indicated 22 % and 2. 5 % (on average) increased recovery, respectively in the DNPDSE method compared with the SX method.

INTEC, {{formerly known as the}} Idaho Chemical Processing Plant, previously reprocessed nuclear fuel to retrieve fissionable uranium. Liquid waste <b>raffinates</b> resulting from reprocessing were solidified into a granular calcine material. Approximately 4, 000 m 3 of calcine are presently being stored in concrete encased stainless steel bins at the INTEC. Greater than 99 weight percent of the calcine is non-radioactive inert materials. By separating radioactive and non-radioactive constituents into high and low activity fractions, a significant high-activity volume reduction can be achieved. Prior to separation, calcine dissolution must be performed. However, dissolution studies have shown a small percentage of solids present after dissolution. Undissolved solids (UDS) in solution must be removed prior to downstream processes such as solvent extraction and ion exchange. Furthermore, residual UDS in solutions have the potential to carry excess radioactivity into low activity waste fractions, if not removed. Filtration experiments were conducted at the INEEL using the Cell Unit Filter (CUF) on actual dissolved H- 4 calcine and dissolved Run 1027 non-radioactive pilot plant calcine. The purpose of this testing was to evaluate the removal and operational efficiency of crossflow filtration on slurries of various solids loading.

A closed cycle equates to a continued supply of fuel and safe reactors, but also reliable and comprehensive closure of waste issues. High level waste (HLW) disposal in borosilicate glass (BSG) is based on 1970 s era evaluations. This host matrix is very adaptable to sequestering a wide variety of radionuclides found in <b>raffinates</b> from spent fuel reprocessing. However, it is now known that the current system is far from optimal for disposal of the diverse HLW streams, and proven alternatives are available to reduce costs by billions of dollars. The basis for HLW disposal should be reassessed to consider extensive waste form and process technology research and development efforts, which have been conducted by the United States Department of Energy (USDOE), international agencies and the private sector. Matching the waste form to the waste chemistry and using currently available technology could increase the waste content in waste forms to 50 % or more and double processing rates. Optimization of the HLW disposal system would accelerate HLW disposition and increase repository capacity. This does not necessarily require developing new waste forms, the emphasis should be on qualifying existing matrices to demonstrate protection equal to or better than the baseline glass performance. Also, this proposed effort does not necessarily require developing new technology concepts. The emphasis is on demonstrating existing technology that is clearly better (reliability, productivity, cost) than current technology, and justifying its use in future facilities or retrofitted facilities.
