40|$|BACKGROUND: Theoretically, {{individual}} work performance (IWP) {{can be divided}} into four dimensions: task performance, contextual performance, adaptive performance, and counterproductive work behavior. However, there is no consensus on the indicators used to measure these dimensions. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to (1) identify indicators for each dimension, (2) select the most <b>relevant</b> <b>indicators,</b> and (3) determine the relative weight of each dimension in ratings of work performance. METHODS: IWP indicators were identified from multiple research disciplines, via literature, existing questionnaires, and expert interviews. Subsequently, experts selected the most <b>relevant</b> <b>indicators</b> per dimension and scored the relative weight of each dimension in ratings of IWP. RESULTS: In total, 128 unique indicators were identified. Twenty-three of these indicators were selected by experts as most relevant for measuring IWP. Task performance determined 36 % of the work performance rating, while the other three dimensions respectively determined 22 %, 20 % and 21 % of the rating. CONCLUSIONS: Notable consensus was found on <b>relevant</b> <b>indicators</b> of IWP, reducing the number from 128 to 23 <b>relevant</b> <b>indicators.</b> This provides an important step towards the development of a standardized, generic and short measurement instrument for assessing IWP...|$|R

40|$|We assess {{threats to}} {{environmental}} sustainability {{by examining the}} trends in three measures of the ecological footprint (EF) — the total EF, the per capita EF, and the EF intensity of the economy (EF/GDP) — for China, India, Japan, and the United States. from 1961 to 2003. The EF, {{an estimate of the}} land area needed to sustain use of the environment, is the most comprehensive measure of anthropogenic pressure on the environment available and is growing in use. We argue that the total EF is the most <b>relevant</b> <b>indicator</b> for assessing threats to nature’s capital and services, that per capita EF is the most <b>relevant</b> <b>indicator</b> of global inequalities, and that EF intensity is the most <b>relevant</b> <b>indicator</b> of economic benefits from environmental exploitation. We find in all four nations that the ecological intensity of the economy declined (i. e., efficiency improved) over this period, but the total national EF increased substantially. This is a demonstration of the Jevons paradox, where efficiency does not appear to reduce resource consumption, but rather escalates consumption thereby increasing threats to environmental sustainability...|$|E

40|$|Micro-organisms {{are vital}} for soil {{fertility}} {{and for the}} degradation of organic matter and pollutants in soils and sediments. Due to their function and ubiquitous presence the microflora can act as an environmentally very <b>relevant</b> <b>indicator</b> of pollution. Microbial tests should be used discriminatory {{for the establishment of}} soil and sediment quality guidelines. This review gives an evaluation of microbial toxicity tests and a novel method to derive quality guidelines. The replacement of sensitive micro-organisms by different resistant species can have serious ecological consequences. Some species become extinct while others appear in bulging numbers. Adaptation of a community to a pollutant must be considered as the very process which disturbs a polluted ecosystem. The resistant micro-organisms often fail to perform specific ecological functions. The occurrence of resistant species {{can be used as a}} sensitive and ecologically <b>relevant</b> <b>indicator</b> for deterioration from environmental pollution. Persistent toxic effects on the microflora can be caused by zinc, cadmium and copper at concentration levels lower than the current European Community limits. After the evaluation of the tests, a novel method is described to derive soil and sediment quality guidelines using microbial toxicity tests. Microbial toxicity tests can be used for risk assessment because micro-organisms are among the most sensitive organisms for the effects of pollutants...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of geochemical indicators for nitrogen (N), acidity, and metals in soil and water (soil solution, ground water and surface water) in view of their impacts on different endpoints (tree growth/health, human health, soil biodiversity etc.). <b>Relevant</b> <b>indicators</b> for N are the soil C/N ratio, nitrate (NO 3) concentration in ground water and total N concentration in soil and surface water. For acidity the most <b>relevant</b> endpoint <b>indicators</b> are the exchangeable base cation pool or base saturation in the soil, the ratio of aluminium (Al) to base cation (Bc) in soil solution, the total Al concentration in ground water and the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) in surface water. <b>Relevant</b> <b>indicators</b> for metals are the total or reactive metal concentration in the soil and the free or total metal ion concentration in water. Using critical limits for those endpoint indicators, it is possible to assess critical loads for both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems based on geochemical modelling.
