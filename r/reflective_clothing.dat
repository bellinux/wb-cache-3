50|$|The roadways in the United States of America are to {{be shared}} with others- this {{includes}} cyclists and equestrians. An equestrian is a rider or performer on horseback, relating primarily to horse riding. According to the State of both Ohio and Pennsylvania, in which a section of each state has an Amish or Mennonite sect, approximately sixty major crashes involving horses and buggies occur yearly, {{over the course of}} a decade (Kelley, 2013). This means that over the course of ten years, approximately six hundred accidents occur that involves horses. These accidents are more common in places such as Ohio and Pennsylvania because of the Amish culture. There are some safety precautions, however, you can make in order to attempt to prevent these types of accidents from occurring. Displaying some form of a fluorescent light or <b>reflective</b> <b>clothing</b> can help other motorists on the road see you more easily (if you are a horseback rider). Riding a horse is best done during daylight and in fair weather. Avoiding riding a horse on roadways in icy, snowy or foggy conditions can decrease the chances of an accident. If your horse is unfamiliar with riding on roads, avoiding roads all together is a safe bet. Horses can be spooked fairly easily, and to minimize your horse becoming panicked, avoiding a busy roadway is a good safety precaution to take. However, if it is necessary to ride on the roadway or cross a roadway, asking someone to accompany you that may be more experienced can be helpful. Riding single file, as well as crossing major roadways in a group increases your visibility for oncoming motorists. Although horses are rather large animals, from a far distance it is easier to see a number of horses rather than just one. For motorists, to increase an equestrians’ safety on the road, be prepared to stop. It is important to not sound your horn or rev your engine while you are near or passing a horse. Although they may be slow moving, patience is important to make sure both the rider and the horse remain safe. Make sure to pass someone who is riding a horse widely (Department for Transport, 2013). For experienced riders, it is also important to have your horse walk, rather than go in a faster gate on roadways that are hard, such as asphalt. Faster gates lead to a higher likelihood of your horse falling with you on it due to the hardness of the surface (The American Quarter Horse Journal, 2017).|$|E

This study undertook a detailed investigation of visibility factors involved in bicyclist-motor-vehicle crashes. We surveyed 184 bicyclists (predominantly from Australia via internet cycling forums) who had been involved in motor vehicle collisions regarding the perceived cause of the collision, ambient weather and general visibility, as well as the clothing and bicycle lights used by the bicyclist. Over a third of the crashes occurred in low light levels (dawn, dusk or night-time), which is disproportionate given that only a small proportion of bicyclists typically ride at these times. Importantly, 19 % of these bicyclists reported not using bicycle lights at the time of the crash, and only 34 % were wearing <b>reflective</b> <b>clothing.</b> Only two participants (of 184) nominated bicyclist visibility as the cause of the crash: 61 % attributed the crash to driver inattention.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} moderate levels of refractive blur and simulated cataracts on nighttime pedestrian conspicuity in the presence and absence of headlamp glare. Methods: The ability to recognize pedestrians at night was measured in 28 young adults (M= 27. 6 years) under three visual conditions: normal vision, refractive blur and simulated cataracts; mean acuity was 20 / 40 or better in all conditions. Pedestrian recognition distances were recorded while participants drove an instrumented vehicle along a closed road course at night. Pedestrians wore one of three clothing conditions and oncoming headlamps were present for 16 participants and absent for 12 participants. Results: Simulated visual impairment and glare significantly reduced the frequency with which drivers recognized pedestrians and the distance at which the drivers first recognized them. Simulated cataracts were significantly more disruptive than blur even though photopic visual acuity levels were matched. With normal vision, drivers responded to pedestrians at 3. 6 x and 5. 5 x longer distances on average than for the blur or cataract conditions, respectively. Even in the presence of visual impairment and glare, pedestrians were recognized more often and at longer distances when they wore a “biological motion” <b>reflective</b> <b>clothing</b> configuration than when they wore a reflective vest or black clothing. Conclusions: Drivers’ ability to recognize pedestrians at night is degraded by common visual impairments even when the drivers’ mean visual acuity meets licensing requirements.

40|$|Purpose To {{quantify}} {{the effects of}} driver age on night-time pedestrian conspicuity, and to determine whether individual differences in visual performance can predict drivers' ability to recognise pedestrians at night. Methods Participants were 32 visually normal drivers (20 younger: M = 24. 4 years ± 6. 4 years; 12 older: M = 72. 0 years ± 5. 0 years). Visual performance was measured in a laboratory-based testing session including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, motion sensitivity and the useful field of view. Night-time pedestrian recognition distances were recorded while participants drove an instrumented vehicle along a closed road course at night; to increase the workload of drivers, auditory and visual distracter tasks were presented {{for some of the}} laps. Pedestrians walked in place, sideways to the oncoming vehicles, and wore either a standard high visibility reflective vest or reflective tape positioned on the movable joints (biological motion). Results Driver age and pedestrian clothing significantly (p < 0. 05) affected the distance at which the drivers first responded to the pedestrians. Older drivers recognised pedestrians at approximately half the distance of the younger drivers and pedestrians were recognised more often and at longer distances when they wore a biological motion <b>reflective</b> <b>clothing</b> configuration than when they wore a reflective vest. Motion sensitivity was an independent predictor of pedestrian recognition distance, even when controlling for driver age. Conclusions The night-time pedestrian recognition capacity of older drivers was significantly worse than that of younger drivers.

40|$|Abstract Background Regular cycling {{has been}} shown to improve health and has a role in {{tackling}} the threats posed by obesity and inactivity. Cycle collisions, particularly those involving motorised vehicles, can lead to significant mortality and morbidity and are currently a barrier to wider uptake of cycling. There is evidence that the conspicuity of cyclists is a factor in many injury collisions. Low-cost, easy to use retro-reflective and fluorescent clothing and accessories ('conspicuity aids') are available. Their effectiveness in reducing cycling collisions is unknown. The study is designed to investigate the relationship between the use of conspicuity aids and risk of collision or evasion crashes for utility and commuter cyclists in the UK. Methods/Design A matched case-control study is proposed. Cases are adult commuter and utility cyclists involved in a crash resulting from a collision or attempted evasion of a collision with another road user recruited at a UK emergency department. Controls are commuter and utility cyclists matched by journey purpose, time and day of travel and geographical area recruited at public and private cycle parking sites. Data on the use of conspicuity aids, crash circumstances, demographics, cycling experience, safety equipment use, journey characteristics and route will be collected using self-completed questionnaires and maps. Conditional logistic regression will be used to calculate adjusted odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals of the risk of a crash when using any item of fluorescent or <b>reflective</b> <b>clothing</b> or equipment.

40|$|British {{statistics}} for 2001 {{showed that there}} were over 12, 000 child road casualties {{between the ages of}} 11 - 16. Research indicates that substantial proportions of adolescent road users may engage in behaviours such as acts of 'risk taking', making errors of perception, and generally deviating from what is considered a 'safe' course of action. Aims to identify the kinds of behaviour carried out by adolescent road users that may influence their safety and to establish how their behaviour varies by demographic characteristic: age, sex and area. 2, 433 pupils from secondary schools in England completed questionnaires designed to measure the frequency with which 43 specific road using behaviours were performed by the target population. The sample was equally distributed across the 11 - 16 year age range. 52. 4 % of the sample was male. 38. 1 % of the sample were from schools in rural areas, 34. 8 % was sampled from schools in small urban areas and 27. 1 % was sampled from schools located in large urban (conurbation) areas. Principal axis factor analysis indicated that the 43 behaviour items were best represented by a three-factor solution, accounting for 34. 6 % of the variance. Factor 1 covered 'unsafe road crossing behaviours' (e. g. 'cross between parked cars' and 'not look when crossing'). Factor 2 was concerned with 'dangerous playing in the road' (e. g. 'playing 'chicken' and 'not noticing a car approaching when playing games in the road'). Factor 3 behaviours were those that involved the use of protective equipment (e. g. wearing <b>reflective</b> <b>clothing)</b> and protecting oneself from some form of risk (e. g. 'use a lollipop man/lady to cross the road'). The label 'planned protective behaviour' was used to describe factor 3. Analysis of variance showed that there were significant main effects of age and sex on all types of behaviour identified. There were also significant effects of area on dangerous playing in the road and planned protective behaviour. Male adolescents reported carrying out unsafe road crossing and dangerous playing in the road more often than did females and reported performing planned protective behaviours less often. The reported frequency of unsafe road crossing increased with movement from the 11 - 12 year old age group to the 13 - 14 year age group and did not change significantly between the ages of 13 - 14 and 15 - 16 years. Dangerous playing in the road also increased with movement from the 11 - 12 to the 13 - 14 year age group, but the reported frequency of this type of behaviour dropped by age 15 - 16 to a level that was not significantly different from 11 - 12 year olds. 13 - 14 year olds reported performing planned protective behaviours less often than did 11 - 12 year olds and 13 - 14 and 15 - 16 year olds did not differ significantly. Finally, children in rural areas reported conducting dangerous playing in the road and planned protective behaviours more often than did children in urban areas. The study provided a three-factor classification of adolescent road user behaviour and showed how behavioural performance varied with age, sex and area. These findings may be of use when deciding how to target remedial action to improve the road safety of adolescent road users. However, {{further research is needed to}} investigate how the three behaviour factors identified in this study are related to objective measures of risk. Research into why adolescents might carry out these kinds of behaviours has recently been completed - see abstract 'Using the theory of planned behaviour to investigate adolescents' road using behaviour'...|$|E
