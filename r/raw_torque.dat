40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel cycling effort control sys-tem that contributes to promote the users’ physical health and mobility. This system controls the motor assistance level of an electric bicycle {{in order to ensure that}} the cyclist’s power output remains inside the desired limits, regardless of changes in variables such as the speed of the bicycle or the slope of the terrain. The power output is monitored using a sensor device that provides <b>raw</b> <b>torque</b> and cadence data, whereas a smartphone application processes these data, implements the effort control algorithm and provides the user interface. Modules on the bicycle handle the data acquisition, wire-less communication with the smartphone and driving of the motor assis-tance level. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the imple-mented power output control system.

40|$|Background and Purpose. Mental {{practice}} {{has been shown}} to be effective in increasing the force production of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in the hand. The aim of this study was to determine whether mental practice could produce strength gains in the larger ankle dorsiflexor muscles, which are important during walking. Sub-jects. Twenty-four subjects were randomly assigned to a physical practice group, a mental practice group, or a control group (8 subjects per group). Methods. In the practice groups, subjects either physically or mentally practiced producing maximal isometric contractions for 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Changes in mean peak isometric torque normalized to body weight and the resulting percentage of improvement were analyzed across the 3 groups. Results. Differences in <b>raw</b> <b>torque</b> production after training in the 2 practice groups resulted in significant percentages of improvement for the physical practice group (25. 28 %) and the mental practice group (17. 13 %), but not for the control group (1. 77 %). The 2 practice groups were not statistically different in their maximal torque-generating capacity after training. Discussion and Conclusion. These findings show that mental practice in people without impairments can lead to an increase in torque production similar to that produced by physical practice. Such a technique may prove to be a useful adjunct to traditional treatment options aimed at increasing muscle strength. [Sidaway B, Trzaska A. Can mental practice increase ankle dorsiflexor torque?

40|$|A–S-Map results. Depicted are the {{averaged}} {{results for}} fly ISIs and <b>raw</b> yaw <b>torque</b> series (for clarity, only openloop data are shown here), together with two automat simulations. The fly ISI series shows a slightly improved forecast skill with increasingly nonlinear S-map solutions (increasing Θ). Fly yaw torque series yield both a better overall forecast skill {{as well as}} increased nonlinear improvement. The automat simulation can be tuned to produce both linear and nonlinear output. B–Sample <b>raw</b> yaw <b>torque</b> data traces from a real fly and the {{two versions of the}} simulated agent depicted in A (automat 1, automat 2).

40|$|In this paper, {{interfacial}} shear rheology {{is presented}} as a method for the characterization of small molecular surfactants as well as proteins adsorbed at the air/water and oil/water interfaces. A biconical disk rheometer is used to measure the steady state and transient interfacial shear viscosities at different surfactant concentrations and with different bulk phases. In order to study the influence of bulk phase contributions to the measured interfacial viscosity values, evaluation of the <b>raw</b> data (<b>torque</b> and angular velocity of the disk) is based on a hydrodynamical analysis of the flow field. The scope and limitations of the rheometer are discussed. Results from transient and steady state shear rate experiments as well as creep recovery tests at both air/water and oil/water interfaces are presented. ...|$|R
