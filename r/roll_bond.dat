2500|$|The most {{authoritative}} {{and well}} researched account of General Bond's death {{is provided by}} the book [...] "Red Eagles: America's Secret MiGs" [...] In it, the author states that on 26 April 1984 Bond, who was about to retire, made a farewell visit to [...] "an Air Force Systems Command unit" [...] believed to have been the 6513th Test Squadron, Red Hats, at Groom Lake. The Red Hats, like the 4477th TES Red Eagles based at Tonopah Test Range, clandestinely operated Soviet aircraft. On a previous visit to Groom, Bond had flown the secret YF-117A prototype. The MiG-23 was known as YF-113 in US service and, along with a greater number of MiG-21s, was part of a collection of Soviet-built aircraft that the 4477th flew. Bond insisted on flying the MiG-23 BN fighter-bomber after a cursory briefing over the cockpit rail, even though it was considered a difficult aircraft and pilots usually received several hours of ground instruction before flying it. On his second high-speed flight, he was flying at 40,000 feet and over Mach 2, and had left the T-38 chase plane that was flying with him far behind, when a hydro-mechanical inhibitor activated, preventing him from disengaging the afterburner. It was designed to avoid sudden shut-downs at high speed that could damage the Tumansky R-29 engine, or even cause it to explode and destroy the aircraft. At such speeds, with the wings fully swept back to 72°, the MiG had very limited pitch authority and was inclined to yaw and <b>roll.</b> <b>Bond</b> lost control, made a distress call ("I gotta get out of here") and was then killed in the ejection, when the slipstream broke his neck and shredded the canopy of his parachute. The aircraft crashed in the desert, diving in at a 60° angle and impacting on what is now known as Jackass Flats, part of Area 25 that was still contaminated from NERVA nuclear rocket testing years before. Bond's body was discovered by a USAF sergeant on his way to work, who removed the rank insignia from Bond's flight suit with a pocket knife before going to get help.|$|E

Afterward, the <b>roll</b> <b>bonded</b> sheet was cut in half and the accumulative <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> (ARB) process at room temperature was applied seven times. As a result, the central steel layer fractured and distributed in the Al matrix among different layers introduced by the repetition of <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> process. The tensile {{results showed that the}} <b>roll</b> <b>bonded</b> sheet has much higher strength and strength to weight ratio compared with the initial aluminum sheet {{as a result of the}} presence of continuous steel core. However, poor ductility properties were observed during tensile test, which were ascribed to the increasing deformation resistance and localized thinning of the central stainless steel sheet during the <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> process. The ARBed sample exhibited lower strength compared with the <b>roll</b> <b>bonded</b> sheet due to the breakup of stainless steel layer into many small segments. Anyway, an ultrafine grained microstructure with average grain size of 400 nm in the aluminum matrix and 71 % strain-induced martensite in the steel segments were detected by the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) technique, which were found to be responsible for the enhancement of mechanical properties compared with the initial aluminum sheet...|$|R
40|$|The work {{carried out}} in this thesis was {{conducted}} to investigate thermomechanical aspects of a steel-aluminum cold <b>roll</b> <b>bonded</b> material. The objective was to study different production parameters related to ageing of an AA 6082 aluminum alloy, combined with IF steel, through a cold <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> process. Three different sequences of solutionizing, ageing, and cold <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> of the materials were tested. Sheets of steel and aluminum, measuring 30 x 120 mm, were used to produce the samples. Each sheet measured roughly 1 mm in thickness, and were stacked {{together to form a}} three layered composite, with aluminum in the middle and steel on either side. The sheets were prepared by scratch brushing, and were <b>roll</b> <b>bonded</b> at pre-heat temperatures of 150, 200, & 300 ^oC. Three different sequences were used for heat treating the aluminum; The BSA samples were <b>roll</b> <b>bonded,</b> followed by solutionizing and ageing to T 6. The SBA samples were solutionized, <b>roll</b> <b>bonded,</b> and then aged to T 6. The SAB samples were solutionized and aged to T 6, followed by <b>roll</b> <b>bonding.</b> The three sequences were meant to determine the optimal way of producing a precipitation hardened structure in the aluminum, while still achieving a good bond to the steel. The cold <b>roll</b> <b>bonded</b> samples were cut into sections and studied through several microstructural and mechanical characterization methods. Optical and scanning electron microscopes were used to study the aluminum grain structure, and the <b>roll</b> <b>bonded</b> interface. A peel testing rig was designed and built to allow for peel testing of the composites with at 90 degree peeling direction. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to study the resulting fracture surfaces, to determine the amount of residual material left on each surface. In summary, the SAB samples were found to produce the greatest bond strengths, followed by the SBA samples, and the BSA samples. The achieved bond strength values were overall fairly low compared to what others have achieved. The solutionizing step caused the aluminum in all samples to recrystallize, and the BSA samples, which were solutionized after <b>roll</b> <b>bonding,</b> developed an intermetallic layer roughly 1 μm thick. This layer was found to severely impact the bond strength of the composite. No intermetallic layers were found for the two other sample sequences. <b>Roll</b> <b>bonding</b> after solutionizing was not found to have any negative effects on the ageing potential.

Despite that, only few works that analyze the performance of this component are available in literature. Furthermore, no evidence is given to the impact on the heat transfer performance when substituting the original HFC refrigerant with an HFO inside the same evaporator. This paper presents an experimental study of R 134 a and R 1234 ze(E) inside an off the shelf <b>roll</b> <b>bond</b> evaporator, commonly used for small size domestic refrigerators. The evaporator was mounted inside a climate dark chamber where ambient temperature and humidity were maintained stable during the tests. To control the inlet conditions (evaporation temperature, inlet quality, refrigerant mass flow rate) it was used a water cooled miniature scale vapor cycle system with R 134 a and R 1234 ze(E) as working fluids. By means of an IR-thermo-camera, the whole <b>roll</b> <b>bond</b> temperature field was investigated under different working conditions. 15 thermocouples were collocated on the back of the evaporator to verify the temperatures reported in the images collected by the IR thermo-camera. From these pictures it was possible to delineate the super heating region and to point out the areas of the evaporator in which heat transfer is less efficient depending on the fluid and on the working conditions. During the experimental tests the refrigerant mass flow rate was varied by regulating the compressor speed, while ambient temperature and evaporation temperature were kept as constant.

50|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>bonding</b> {{is a solid}} state, {{cold welding}} process, {{obtained}} through flat rolling of sheet metals. In <b>roll</b> <b>bonding,</b> two or more layers of different metals are passed through a pair of flat rollers under sufficient pressure to bond the layers.

The strength of the <b>rolled</b> <b>bonds</b> depends on the main process parameters, including the rolling conditions (entry temperature of the sheets, amount of thickness reduction, rolling speed, etc.), the pre-rolling treatment conditions (annealing temperature and time, surface preparation techniques, etc.) and the post-rolling heat treatments.|$|R

It {{has been found}} that a reaction between the fuel and the aluminum matrix may reduce or increase the irradiation stability of the fuel. To further understand the contribution of the reaction to the irradiation stability, experiments to develop a non-reacting matrix were performed. The work focused on magnesium (Mg), which is an excellent non-reacting matrix candidate and has a neutron absorption coefficient similar to Al. To avoid the formation of a liquid Al/Mg phase, improvements were made to the roll bonding process to achieve acceptable bonding at 415 C. After these methods were developed, fuel plates were produced with two fuels, uranium (U) - 2 w/o molybdenum (Mo) and U- 10 -w/o Mo with two matrices, Al and Mg.

40|$|Clad metals are {{extensively}} {{used for}} their multi-functionality and their optimal combination {{of quality and}} cost. <b>Roll</b> <b>bonding</b> is an effective and economic processing approach to making clad metals. This dissertation presents an experimental investigation of the roll cladding process as well as thermo-mechanical modeling of mechanism for <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> of clad metals. The objectives of this research are to investigate the bonding mechanism of dissimilar metals in a warm rolling process and to advance {{the knowledge of the}} roll cladding process. To accomplish the objectives, aluminum 1100 sheet (Al 1100) and stainless steel 304 sheet (SST 304) are bonded by warm rolling under controlled conditions. The 180 degrees peel test is used to determine the bonding property of those clad metals. The experimental results show that the rolling thickness reduction and the entry temperature are two major factors of bonding strength. Minimum thickness reduction at a particular entry temperature is required to bond Al 1100 and SST 304. Increasing of either thickness reduction or entry temperature significantly improves the bonding strength between the two metals. X-ray microanalysis is also performed to characterize the diffusion state at the bonding interface. The diffusion coefficients of aluminum and iron are estimated through experimental method. A thermo-mechanical model was developed to describe the rolling plastic deformation of component metal sheets and the diffusion evolution during a <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> process of dissimilar metals. The effect of various rolling conditions on the contact area ratio was quantitatively discussed. Finite element simulation of 2 -D diffusion under the rolling created boundary conditions was performed.

The correspondence validates the effectiveness of the thermo-mechanical <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> model.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Roll</b> <b>bonding</b> is a joining-by-forming operation, {{in which}} two or more {{metallic}} strips or plates are bonded permanently through the pressure and plastic deformation in the roll gap. Although <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> has been successfully used in industrial production over many years, difficulties occur especially when materials of largely different yield strength are roll-bonded, e. g. when hard aluminum alloys are clad with soft commercially pure aluminum. Examples are AA 2024 sheets used in wing and fuselage structures of aircrafts, which are clad with AA 1050 to improve the corrosion resistance. Likewise, aluminum sheets for heat exchangers consist of a hard base material that is clad with a soft solderable aluminum alloy. In these cases, the strength difference may influence the bonding behavior since the softer face sheet has to transmit the deformation to the harder core material. To analyze and optimize such cases, a bonding model integrated into a numerical framework for the simulation of the <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> process is required. In this paper, a finite element model is presented, in which the development of bond strength is simulated using a cohesive contact formulation. The model is used to study the bonding behavior of laboratory-scale <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> trials of two aluminum alloys with a large difference in yield strength. It is found that shear stresses are generated {{towards the end of}} the roll gap that may exceed the shear bond strength created earlier in the roll gap such that no firm bond is obtained. The conditions under which bonding is successful are analyzed using a finite element simulation study with varying yield stress differences and pass reductions and summarized in a map...|$|R

Specifically, a two-stage grain growth behavior was observed, in which a relatively slower rate of grain growth was followed by a more rapid grain growth rate at higher annealing temperature. The bonding interfaces that were unique to the <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> process were found to have a significant influence on the grain growth behavior when the grain size of the material was of similar dimension as the bonding interface separation. Discontinuous pockets consisting of smaller grains were found to have formed upon annealing. These pockets represented the remnants of the heavily deformed layer from wire brushing. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R

40|$|International audienceManufacturing of {{bimetallic}} laminates (< 2 mm) with {{an internal}} architecture by <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> allows {{to obtain a}} compromise of conflicting properties. Two applications are considered: copper-steel-copper sheets for high power electronic component substrates and lightweight aluminium-steel-aluminium laminates for structural, electromagnetic applications in power generation and for electromagnetic compatibility. They have in common an architecture, with three-dimensional percolating networks of two metals produced with a sufficient precision. The bonding mechanisms are investigated through microstructural and thermomechanical characterisation of the assemblies produced. <b>Roll</b> <b>bonding</b> fills the voids in a central component by plastic deformation and creates the bonds by cold welding. It may be followed or preceded by surface and heat treatments with the objective to improve the cold welding and to relieve the internal stress state. Architectural rules to optimise {{the properties of the}} two-phase laminates in view of the applications may be guided by finite element models combining physical and thermomechanical aspects...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{extended}} accumulative <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> (ARB) technique, called the 2 ̆ 7 Four-Layer Accumulative <b>Roll</b> <b>Bonding</b> (FL-ARB) 2 ̆ 7 technique, is presented {{for the first}} time. This technique has been employed to produce ultrafine-grained commercial pure aluminum sheets with success. After three FL-ARB passes, the grain size of pure aluminum was seen to reduce to 380 nm. The bonding strength of the sheets after rolling has also been discussed. Theoretical calculations showed that the bonding strength of sheets processed by the FL-ARB technique can be 2 - 2. 2 times greater than that by the traditional ARB technique. The main advantages of the FL-ARB technique are (a) improvement of the interface bonding, with increasing deformation in each pass, (b) applicability of the technique at room temperature to process most metals, and (c) generation of the largest equivalent strain in the workpiece with {{the same number of}} passes, compared with other severe plastic deformation techniques...|$|R
40|$|Strips {{were made}} by {{accumulative}} <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> of up to 64 alternating layers of an AA 3103 alloy and either commercial purity copper or CuZn 20 brass as {{the second type of}} layer. With increasing number of accumulative <b>roll</b> <b>bonding</b> cycles the layered structure became unstable. Instability in the strongest layer observed by secondary electron micrographs and orientation imaging micrographs revealed shear bands through the strong layers. The influence of the layer instability on the mechanical properties was investigated by tensile tests and three point bending tests. Numerical simulations using the commercial finite element software DEFORM 2 D were used for investigating the instability mechanism in deformation of the multilayers. It is argued that the earlier proposed explanations and analytical estimates of the necking in the hard layers due to internal stresses do not apply. Instead the onset of the instability {{is in the form of}} a zigzag-shear instability, where the layers experience periodic increased thinning and bending...|$|R
