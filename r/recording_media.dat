25|$|The first {{recording}} of The Magic Flute {{was of a}} live performance at the 1937 Salzburg Festival, with Arturo Toscanini conducting the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera. The first studio {{recording of}} the work, with Sir Thomas Beecham conducting the Berlin Philharmonic, was completed in 1938. Both of these historic recordings have been reissued on modern <b>recording</b> <b>media.</b> Since then {{there have been many}} recordings, in both audio and video formats.|$|E
25|$|Besides being {{far easier}} to handle, the wax <b>recording</b> <b>media</b> also allowed for lengthier {{recordings}} and created superior playback quality. The Graphophone designs initially deployed foot treadles to rotate the recordings which were then replaced by more convenient wind-up clockwork drive mechanisms and which finally migrated to electric motors, instead of the manual crank that was used on Edison's phonograph. The numerous improvements allowed for a sound quality that was significantly better than Edison's machine.|$|E
25|$|Under the AHRA, {{royalties}} {{collected by}} the Copyright Office on digital recording devices and digital <b>recording</b> <b>media</b> are divided into two separate funds, the Musical Works Fund and the Sound Recordings Fund.

These parties receive royalties according {{to the extent to}} which their recordings were distributed or broadcast.|$|E

25|$|On early <b>recording</b> <b>media</b> (until 1925) such as wax {{cylinders}} and discs {{carved with}} an engraving needle, sound balancing meant that musicians {{had to be}} literally moved in the room. Drums were often put far from the horn (part of the mechanical transducer) to reduce sound distortion. Since this affected the rendition of cymbals at playback, sound engineers of the time remedied the situation by asking drummers to play {{the content of the}} cymbals onto woodblocks, temple blocks, and cowbells for their loudness and short decay.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} whether the {{recording}} industry ever thought that revenue from royalties would compensate for revenues lost to the first generation copying authorized by the AHRA. Given their willingness to block all distribution of all digital audio <b>recording</b> <b>media</b> and devices in the United States, {{that the combination of}} SCMS and the price premium imposed by royalties was intended to cripple the market. It is also possible that given a new technology, and the Act's unprecedented provisions (royalties, legislative mandates for copy protection), they could not predict the impact of the AHRA on adoption of the new technology.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{over time}} the cameras and <b>recording</b> <b>media</b> for {{fluoroscopic}} imaging have progressed as follows. The original kind of fluoroscopy, and the common kind for its first half century of existence, simply used none, because for most diagnosis and treatment, they weren't essential. For those investigations {{that needed to be}} transmitted or recorded (such as for training or research), movie cameras using film (such as 16 mm film) were the medium. In the 1950s, analog electronic video cameras (at first only producing live output but later using video tape recorders) appeared. Since the 1990s, there have been digital video cameras, flat panel detectors, and storage of data to local servers or (more recently) secure cloud servers. Late-model fluoroscopes all use digital image processing and image analysis software, which not only helps to produce optimal image clarity and contrast but also allows that result with a minimal radiation dose (because signal processing can take tiny inputs from low radiation doses and amplify them while to some extent also differentiating signal from noise).|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1980s, {{limitations}} of the 5¼-inch format became clear. Originally designed to be more practical than the 8-inch format, it was itself too large; as the quality of <b>recording</b> <b>media</b> grew, data could be stored in a smaller area. A number of solutions were developed, with drives at 2-, 2½-, 3-, 3¼-, 3½- and 4-inches (and Sony's 90.0mm×94.0mm disk) offered by various companies. They all shared a number of advantages over the old format, including a rigid case with a sliding metal cover over the head slot, which helped protect the delicate magnetic medium from dust and damage, and a sliding write protection tab, which was far more practical than the adhesive tabs used with earlier disks. The large market share of the 5¼-inch format {{made it difficult for}} these new formats to gain significant market share. A variant on the Sony design, introduced in 1982 by a large number of manufacturers, was then rapidly adopted; by 1988 the 3½-inch was outselling the 5¼-inch.|$|E
