[...] Myatt, writing in his autobiography Myngath, admits that during this time he did organize a small gang [...] "whose aim was to liberate goods, fence them, and make some money with the initial intent of aiding our political struggle."

50|$|Softly, Softly {{centred on}} the work of <b>regional</b> police <b>crime</b> <b>squads,</b> plain-clothes CID {{officers}} based in the fictional region of Wyvern, supposedly in the Bristol area of England. It was designed as a vehicle for Detective Chief Inspector Charles Barlow and Detective Inspector John Watt (played by Stratford Johns and Frank Windsor respectively) from the police series Z-Cars, which had just finished its original run in December 1965 (no new episodes were produced in 1966 but it was revived in a different format the following year). Joining them in the early series was Robert Keegan as Blackitt, the police station sergeant from Z-Cars, now retired and acting as a freelance helper.

He was given several seasons of his own solo series, Barlow at Large (later Barlow) which ran from 1971 to 1975. Barlow joined Watt (Frank Windsor) for the 1973 serial Jack the Ripper. The serial's success led to a further spin-off entitled Second Verdict in which Barlow and Watt looked into unsolved cases and unsafe convictions.|$|E

50|$|He {{introduced}} few reforms or innovations. He did {{set up the}} Research and Planning Branch and the Metropolitan and Provincial <b>Regional</b> <b>Crime</b> <b>Squad</b> and centralised {{traffic control}} in response to rising private car ownership. He did little to combat the rising crime rate, however; he refused to address the outdated hardline attitudes of many senior detectives, which were becoming increasingly {{out of step with}} postwar society; and he did not support his men in their claims for better pay and conditions. Police pay fell rapidly below inflation and rates of pay in the private sector. This caused recruiting problems and the force became seriously under strength. Nott-Bower was regarded by many of his officers as a pleasant but ineffectual man. He retired in August 1958.|$|E

In Newcastle Crown Court, it was alleged that Warren was so well informed, that he knew {{the length of the}} largest drill bit owned by HM Customs, and therefore the size/depth of the required ingots. Eventually, through Tory MP Tim Devlin, a meeting was arranged in which Customs was ordered to drop charges against Charrington on 28 January 1993.

He had been in bed when he received a telephone call from the duty officer at the station advising him about the body [...] "dumped on his patch". He arrived at the murder scene as the victim's body was being taken away by mortuary personnel. Nesbitt addressed his nine-man murder squad on 26 November with the following statement: [...] "We're looking for somebody more brutal than the average terrorist and we'd better get to him". Crossan had had his throat slashed so deeply by his assailant that he was almost decapitated with just a tissue of flesh connecting the head to the trunk. When his corpse was found the head was lying almost at right angles to his body.

While {{showering}} at the hotel before Tammy arrives, the narrator is kidnapped by two unidentified men and transported across London to The City.

In his rage, Jimmy believed that his old friend Eddie had arranged for Jimmy to be ensnared, and he therefore tasked the narrator to find Charlie, Eddie's daughter. Jimmy believed that if he could hold Charlie hostage, he could force Eddie to get his money back. Eddie goes on to explain that Jimmy has been moonlighting as a police informer for a number of years. Eddie plays the narrator a recording in which Jimmy speaks with Albie Carter, a member of the Southeast <b>Regional</b> <b>Crime</b> <b>Squad.</b> Jimmy tells Albie that he wants the narrator to be arrested for possession of drugs, which would result in a 12-year sentence.
