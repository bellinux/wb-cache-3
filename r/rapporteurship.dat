40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the distribution}} of reports and <b>rapporteurships</b> in the 1989 - 99 European Parliament among party groups and national delegations. The data consists of all reports and <b>rapporteurships</b> in the third (1989 - 94) and fourth (1994 - 99) Parliament and of interviews with committee staff. We show {{that the size of}} a group predicts well its share of the reports. Correlations coefficients between the number of members in a group and the number of reports they produced are very high, generally over. 950. Party groups are, within certain limits, willing to make trade-offs and to cede reports to smaller groups, but on the whole they compete hard over the reports in order to influence the EU policy process. The procedures for allocating committee chairs (d'Hondt system), committee seats (proportionality rule), and reports (points system based on groups' share of seats) can be interpreted as mechanisms for the party groups to control the committees in a situation where the former are relatively weak (compared to European national parliaments). The two largest groups, PSE and PPE, control legislative reports. There is considerable variation in {{the distribution of}} <b>rapporteurships</b> between national delegations. Scattered distribution over several groups, with weak presence in the core groups, correlates positively with low report production...|$|R

40|$|Building on the {{understanding}} that a career is a dynamic concept, this article applies the idea that parliamentarians’ legislative activities vary according to their career stage and age. This is partly a function of experience and partly a function of future career prospects. Using a new data set of the German Bundestag (2002 – 13) that pinpoints the age and career stage of MPs {{at the time of}} individual activities, namely, attending votes, posing parliamentary questions, and holding <b>rapporteurships,</b> we identify practical and normative challenges to MPs’ legislative work: It takes time to learn the trade and as the desire for re-election dissipates, a last-period problem arises. MPs significantly reduce their activity levels toward the end of their legislative careers, indicating a clear loss of accountability toward their parties and their constituents...|$|R

40|$|First Published October 23, 2015 EU {{legislative}} decision-making {{is increasingly}} shifted into informal secluded arenas. Scholars have explained this trend and analysed its consequences for bargaining success and democratic legitimacy. Yet, we {{know little about}} how informalisation affects legislative behaviour in the EP. This article contributes to closing the gap, by theorising and analysing the impact of ‘early agreements’ on cohesion. Given the reputational, political and transaction costs of failing an early agreement in plenary, we expect political groups to invest heavily in discipline and consensus, and legislators to comply in votes. Using a new dataset, combining Hix et al. ’s roll-call data with original codecision data (1999 - 2011), we show that informalisation increases cohesion but only for centrist parties. <b>Rapporteurships</b> and votes on ‘costly’ legislative resolutions also matter, but do not mediate the effect of early agreement...|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of assignments to European Parliament negotiating teams comprising both rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. We re-examine the argument that under-representation of MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) from new Member States on these key posts after enlargement might {{have been due to}} a 'learning phase'. We find that MEPs from newer Member States remain considerably less likely to act as rapporteurs during the second term after enlargement (2009 – 14). Most importantly, this trend also holds for shadow <b>rapporteurships</b> under the co-decision procedure, which is when they matter most. This structural under-representation entails important implications for European integration, most importantly that MEPs from newer Member States are less able to influence legislation. We suggest that the patterns we find could be the result of reduced willingness, a more limited skill set, or a structural disadvantage of MEPs from the accession states in the report allocation process...|$|R
40|$|An {{earlier version}} of this paper was {{presented}} at the 31 st UACES annual conference in Bristol, September 2001. I thank the participants in the panel for their comments. This paper investigates the division of labour inside the European Parliament in the light of contending theories, using evidence from its fisheries committee. The aim of the paper is to find out the causes of specialisation and whether the committee is representative of the full chamber, using socio-economic variables such as the fisheries sector share of employment or production as proxies for MEPs’ preferences. The paper starts by analysing nominal committee membership. Then, it goes deeper to investigate participation inside committee, by analysing the allocation of <b>rapporteurships,</b> which are used by the EP to organise its work inside committees. Finally, the conclusions summarise the main findings on the causes of specialisation and the representativeness of committees, and introduce some normative considerations about the efficiency of self-selection...|$|R

50|$|A new {{electoral law}} was {{established}} in 2005 under Calderoli's <b>rapporteurship,</b> and then dubbed Calderoli Law, {{and it is a}} form of semi-proportional representation. A party presents its own closed list and it can join other parties in alliances. The coalition which receives a plurality automatically wins at least 26 seats. Respecting this condition, seats are divided between coalitions, and subsequently to party lists, using the largest remainder method with a Hare quota. To receive seats, a party must overcome the barrier of 8% of the vote if it contests a single race, or of 3% of the vote if it runs in alliance. The change in the electoral law was strongly requested by the UDC, and finally agreed by Berlusconi, although criticised (including by political scientist Giovanni Sartori) for its comeback to proportionalism and its timing, less than one year before general elections.Calderoli himself defined the electoral law as a porcata - a pork affair.|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} a central {{aspect of the}} micromanage-ment of the European Parliament, the determinants of <b>rapporteurship</b> allocation. Focusing on the period from 1995 to 1999, I match <b>rapporteurship</b> assignments in the commit-tee on environment with occupational, group membership, ideological and national data. The study asks {{which of the two}} distinct features of committees, distributional concern or informational provision, determines <b>rapporteurship</b> selec-tion. My analysis shows that the group of rapporteurs does not mirror the composition of the full plenary. Moreover, the results are consistent with the view that a multifaceted combination of the two concepts of ‘demanding ’ and ‘informative ’ committees promises a richer explanation of rapporteur assignment than any one of those theories alone...|$|E
40|$|The UK has {{influenced}} some major EU policies, {{such as the}} creation of the single market and enlargement. But how influential are the UK government and British MEPs in the day-to-day EU legislative process? To answer this question, this article analyses recent data from the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. The evidence is mixed. In the Council, in recent years the UK government has been outvoted more often than any other EU government, yet UK officials remain well connected ‘behind the scenes’. In the European Parliament, British MEPs are now more likely to be on the losing side than are the MEPs of any other member state, yet British MEPs still win key committee chairs and <b>rapporteurships.</b> The evidence suggests that if the UK votes to remain in the EU, Britain's political elites will need to re-engage with Brussels politics if the UK is to avoid becoming further marginalised from mainstream EU politics...|$|R
40|$|This {{piece of}} {{research}} develops and tests {{a model of}} <b>rapporteurship</b> allocation in the European Parliament, analysing the nature of populist and radical right parties’ engagement in the <b>rapporteurship</b> system, during {{the fourth and fifth}} parliamentary terms. The model of <b>rapporteurship</b> allocation builds upon previous research by Yoshinaka et al (2010), and develops the analysis with specific reference to populist and radical right parties. Having discussed the types of populist and radical right parties represented in the European Parliament, this piece of research presents a theoretical framework for studying such parties in a variety of legislatures. Populist and radical right parties are less likely than parties of other traditions to act as rapporteurs in the European Parliament. This is, in part, due to their anti-establishment position, which sees them advocating for a disenfranchised people unrepresented by the political elite. This anti-establishment position results in many populist parties, particularly those from the right wing, failing to fully engage in the European Parliament’s processes. This piece of research uses a number of quantitative techniques to analyse the effect certain variables have on the propensity of populist and radical right members to act as rapporteurs. Even when controlling for a variety of variables, I find that populism significantly, negatively, impacts upon the likelihood of a member to act as a rapporteur. This situation is amplified for Eurosceptic members. The qualitative element of this piece of research seeks to establish whether there is any link between populist and radical right party policy aims and the content of reports their rapporteurs write. Using a coding system derived from the Euromanifesto Project, I conduct a content analysis of reports. Overall, there is little correlation between Euromanifestos and reports, but {{there does seem to be}} some parity between general salient party goals and report content...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} which factors determine <b>rapporteurship</b> allocation {{for reviewing}} bills of law {{submitted by the}} Brazilian Executive Branch to the Chamber of Deputies. We argue that the rapporteurs' influence lies in their position as informational agents in the preliminary review committees. Based on this theoretical proposition, we identify {{the reasons why the}} first term of the Cardoso Administration witnessed a non-negligible number of rapporteurs from the minority opposition who were designated to report on bills submitted by the Executive. The hypotheses are tested through a statistical model that estimates the number of reports on Executive bills each Deputy obtained during the 1995 - 98 Legislature by using original data on the characteristics of the Deputies, their parties, and the committees to which they belonged...|$|E
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{identify}} {{factors that influence}} the chances of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) becoming rapporteurs. More specifically, it attempts {{to answer the question}} of how MEPs from the accession countries were integrated into the report allocation process, which is crucial for EU legislative decision-making. Drawing on extended data from the last three legislative terms (1994 - 2009), the results confirm and challenge existing knowledge. First, the allocation of <b>rapporteurship</b> does not mirror the composition of the full plenary, but points towards strong under-representation of certain national delegations. Most important is the virtual absence of MEPs from the accession countries. Representing 22 % of the full plenary, they reported on only 9 % of all co-decision procedures concluded in the first legislative term after the 2004 enlargement. This pattern of under-representation is evident even when comparing the figures with first-time MEPs form the longer-standing Member States...|$|E
