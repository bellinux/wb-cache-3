40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the role of interferon as initial and maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma. Between 1984 and 1994, 204 patients with newly diagnosed Stage III or Stage IV follicular lymphoma were randomized to receive either, Chlorambucil (CB) : 10  mg daily for 6 weeks, followed by a 2 -week interval, with 3 subsequent 2 -week treatment periods at the same dose, separated by 2 -week intervals, or, CB given concurrently with interferon (IFN). IFN was given at a dose of 3 × 106 units thrice weekly, subcutaneously, throughout the 18 -week treatment period. Responding patients were subsequently randomized to receive maintenance IFN at the dose and schedule described above, or to expectant management. The overall response rate was 161 / 204 (78 %), complete remission being achieved in 24 % of patients. Neither the addition of IFN to the initial treatment, nor the use of maintenance IFN influenced response <b>rate,</b> <b>remission</b> duration or survival. This study was undertaken to determine whether IFN, given in combination with, and then subsequent to, CB would alter the clinical course of patients with follicular lymphoma. Disappointingly, this objective was not achieved, no advantage having been demonstrated for the addition of IFN. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [URL]...|$|E

Patients newly diagnosed with CD using IFX as induction therapy were enrolled. After 6 times of IFX infusions, they were divided into IFX monotherapy group and IFX-AZA sequential therapy group. Clinical <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> were assessed at weeks 57, 84, 111, and 138 while endoscopic <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> were assessed at weeks 84 and 138 to {{evaluate the}} efficacy of these two groups. Results. A total of seventy-nine patients had accomplished 138 -week follow-up. At weeks 84 and 138, the deep <b>remission</b> <b>rate</b> (18 / 22 and 17 / 22) of IFX monotherapy group was significantly higher compared to IFX-AZA sequential therapy group (26 / 57 and 21 / 57) (P= 0. 004 and 0. 001, resp.).

Evidence suggests that therapy with a combined serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor {{may be a more}} effective therapy of major depressive disorder (MDD) than a single neurotransmitter inhibitor. The present study assessed the efficacy and tolerability between duloxetine (dual neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor) 40 - 60 mg/day and escitalopram (single neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor) 10 - 20 mg/day in 24 patients as an open labeled randomized study over a duration of 12 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was the mean total change in 17 items Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD 17) from baseline to end point using the last observation carrying forward. Tolerability was evaluated by assessing discontinuation rates, adverse event rates, vital signs, and laboratory tests. In the present study, the primary analysis detected a statistically significant difference at p=. 025 using Fischer’s test between duloxetine and escitalopram in both response and remission rates. There was no significant difference detected in efficacy of onset between the two study groups. Response <b>rate,</b> <b>remission</b> rate and efficacy of onset were highly significant at p< 0. 05 using Wilcoxon signed rank test within each group. There were a few adverse effects that were mild and self limiting with both molecules.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether interferon (IFN) -alpha 2, when given with or following chemotherapy, influences response <b>rate,</b> <b>remission</b> duration, and survival in newly diagnosed patients with follicular lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten phase III studies evaluating {{the role of}} IFN-alpha 2 in 1, 922 newly diagnosed patients with follicular lymphoma were analyzed. Updated individual patient data were used to perform meta-analyses for response, survival, and remission duration. RESULTS: The addition of IFN-alpha 2 to initial chemotherapy did not significantly influence response rate. An overall meta-analysis for survival showed {{a significant difference in}} favor of IFN-alpha 2, but also showed significant heterogeneity between studies. Further analyses were carried out in order to explain this heterogeneity, and to define the circumstances in which IFN-alpha 2 prolonged survival. The survival advantage was seen when IFN-alpha 2 was given: (1) in conjunction with relatively intensive initial chemotherapy (2 P =. 00005), (2) at a dose >/= 5 million units (2 P =. 000002), (3) at a cumulative dose >/= 36 million units per month (2 P =. 000008), and (4) with chemotherapy rather than as maintenance therapy (P =. 004). With regard to remission duration, there was also a significant difference in favor of IFN-alpha 2, irrespective of the intensity of chemotherapy used, IFN dose, or whether IFN was given as a maintenance strategy or with chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: When given in the context of relatively intensive initial chemotherapy, and at a dose >/= 5 million units (>/= 36 x 10 (6) units per month), IFN-alpha 2 prolongs survival and remission duration in patients with follicular lymphom...|$|E

Till now, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the total number of such cases reported worldwide is less than 100. In this survey, we collected the data of PTLD localized to the CNS (CNS-PTLD) and compared this data with other PTLD patients with localizations to other areas serving as the control group. A comprehensive search was performed for studies reporting CNS-PTLD data in the Pubmed and Google scholar search engines. Finally, international data from 21 different studies were included in the analysis. Overall, 367 patients were entered into analysis. Organ recipients with CNS-PTLD had comparable gender make up, lymphoma cell types, Epstein-Barr virus infection <b>rate,</b> <b>remission</b> and mortality rates, with PTLD patients having other localizations. Multiorgan involvement as well as disseminated lymphoma were significantly more prevalent in the control group (P < 0. 05). At the last follow-up, 192 (60 %) patients were dead (47 missing data). Irrespective of whether the overall death or only death due to PTLD was used as the final outcome, we found that the survival rates were similar for patients of the two groups (P = 0. 895). Renal transplant recipients are at greater risk for developing CNS involvement by PTLD, while heart and liver recipients represent significant lower risks for the same. This study showed that PTLD patients who had CNS presentation have quite a comparable outcome compared with those with other areas of localization.

Methods: MTX-naïve patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with poor prognostic factors were eligible to enter Certolizumab-Optimal Prevention of joint damage for Early RA (C-OPERA), a multicentre, randomised, controlled study, which consisted of a 52 -week double-blind (DB) period and subsequent 52 -week post treatment (PT) period. Patients were randomised to optimised MTX+CZP (n= 159) or optimised MTX+placebo (PBO; n= 157). Following the DB period, patients entered the PT period, receiving MTX alone (CZP+MTX→MTX; n= 108, PBO+MTX→MTX; n= 71). Patients who flared could receive rescue treatment with open-label CZP.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{determine}} whether patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer draw benefit from combination chemotherapy as first-line treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 260 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer fulfilling high-risk criteria, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, were randomized to receive either mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) or {{the combination of}} fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC) every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued until complete remission plus two cycles, or until disease progression. In the case of partial remission or stable disease, treatment was stopped after 12 cycles. Second-line treatment was vindesine, mitomycin and prednisolone. Gain from treatment was estimated using a modified Brunner's score composed of time to progression, patients' rating of the treatment benefit, alopecia, vomiting and performance status. RESULTS: After recruitment from 1992 to 1997 and observation from 1997 to 1999, the final evaluation showed that single-agent treatment with mitoxantrone does not differ significantly from combination treatment with FEC in terms of response, objective remission <b>rate,</b> <b>remission</b> duration, time to response, time to best response, time to progression or overall survival. There was, however, {{a significant difference in}} gain from treatment using a modified Brunner's score favoring the single-agent treatment arm. There was no evidence that any subgroup would fare better with combination treatment. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was detected between the treatment with mitoxantrone as a single agent and the combination of low-dose FEC in terms of response or survival; therefore, the imperative of the necessity of first-line combination chemotherapy for patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer may be questioned. Since toxicity and quality of life score favored the single-agent mitoxantrone treatment arm, this treatment may be offered to patients preferring quality of life to a potential small prolongation of survival...|$|E

This necessitates incorporating quantifiable psychosocial variables with traditional symptomatic data. We aimed to assess clinical and psychosocial remission in schizophrenia {{in a large}} cohort of community dwelling persons with schizophrenia. We emphasized between-groups comparison of antipsychotic medications and administration methods {{on the outcome of}} remission. Methods Psychiatric case managers <b>rated</b> psychosocial <b>remission</b> using the PsychoSocial Remission Scale (PSRS) and clinical remission using the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group symptomatic remission criteria (RSWG). Ratings were performed for persons with schizophrenia they have been treating for 6 months or more. Data as to gender, age and pharmacological treatment of each patient were also collected. Results Of 445 participants who completed the survey, 268 (60 %) were evaluated by psychiatrists, 161 (36 %) by nurses and 16 (4 %) were evaluated by social workers. Patients mean age was 43. 4 [*]+[*] 13. 1 years; 61 % were men and 39 % were women.

Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and ClinicalTrials. gov were systematically reviewed {{to assess the}} treatment effects and safety profiles of patients with MDD who were treated with 10 mg vortioxetine. The outcome measures included response <b>rate,</b> <b>remission</b> rate, changes from baseline in Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (24 -items) (HAM-D 24), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scores. Results were expressed with risk ratio or weighted mean difference with 95 % confidence intervals. Pooled results were calculated using a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model according to the heterogeneity among included trials. Results: Six RCTs with a total of 1, 801 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. The 10 mg vortioxetine dose significantly increased the response rate and remission rate in the treatment of MDD compared with placebo. Moreover, there was a statistically significant reduction from baseline in the MADRS, HAM-D 24, CGI-S, and CGI-I scores with 10 mg vortioxetine vs placebo. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, and hyperhidrosis was higher in the 10 mg vortioxetine group than in the placebo group. Conclusion: Vortioxetine 10 mg can significantly increase the response rate and remission rate, and reduce the MADRS, HAM-D 24, CGI-S, and CGI-I scores in patients with MDD with an acceptable risk of treatment-emergent adverse events.

Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to systematically review the efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of quetiapine in adult patients with GAD. Methods: The SCOPUS, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials. gov databases were searched in April 2015. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of GAD were considered to be included in this meta-analysis. All RCTs of quetiapine in GAD patients providing endpoint outcomes relevant to severity of anxiety, response <b>rate,</b> <b>remission</b> rate, overall discontinuation rate, or discontinuation rate due to adverse events were included. The version reports from suitable clinical studies were explored, and the important data were extracted. Measurement for efficacy outcomes consisted of the mean-changed scores of the rating scales for anxiety, and response rate. Results: A total of 2, 248 randomized participants in three RCTs were included. The pooled mean-changed score of the quetiapine-treated group was greater than that of the placebo-treated group and comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Unfortunately, the response and the remission rates in only 50 and 150 mg/day of quetiapine-XR (extended-release) were better than those of the placebo. Their response and remission rates were comparable to SSRIs. The rates of pooled overall discontinuation and discontinuation due to adverse events of quetiapine-XR were greater than placebo. Only the overall discontinuation rate of quetiapine-XR at 50 and 150 mg/day and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events of quetiapine-XR at 50 mg/day were comparable to SSRIs. Conclusion: Based on this meta-analysis, quetiapine-XR is efficacious in the treatment of GAD in adult patients. Despite its low acceptability and tolerability, the use of 50 – 150 mg/day quetiapine-XR for adult GAD patients may be considered as an alternative treatment.

Methods: We conducted a 24 -week, rater-masked, randomized trial of escitalopram (5 – 20 mg/day) versus paroxetine controlled release (12. 5 – 50 mg/day) in patients with MDD (UMIN 000011191). Patients with the diagnosis of moderate-to-severe MDD (a 17 -item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAMD- 17], with total score at baseline being ≥ 20) were recruited {{to participate in a}} parallel, randomized, controlled trial. The primary outcome for efficacy was an improvement in the 21 -item HAMD (HAMD- 21) total score at 24 weeks. The secondary outcomes were the response, remission, and discontinuation rates and the incidence of individual adverse events. Results: A total of 88 patients with MDD (males, 61. 4 %; mean age, 40. 8 ± 13. 4 years) were recruited. The discontinuation rate was 58. 0 % (escitalopram, 55. 8 %; paroxetine controlled release, 60. 0 %). Both escitalopram and paroxetine controlled-release treatment groups exhibited significant reduction in the HAMD- 21 total score at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks from the baseline.

Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the efficacy and safety of OFC with olanzapine or fluoxetine monotherapy for patients with TRD. Materials and methods: RCTs published in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the ClinicalTrials. gov registry were systematically reviewed to assess the efficacy and safety of OFC. Outcomes included mean changes from baseline in Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores, response <b>rate,</b> <b>remission</b> rate, and adverse events.

Results: A total of five RCTs with 3, 020 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with olanzapine or fluoxetine monotherapy, OFC was associated with greater changes from baseline in MADRS (WMD =- 3. 37, 95 % CI: - 4. 76, - 1. 99; P< 0. 001), HAM-A (WMD =- 1. 82, 95 % CI: - 2. 25, - 1. 40; P< 0. 001), CGI-S (WMD =- 0. 37, 95 % CI: - 0. 45, - 0. 28; P< 0. 001), and BPRS scores (WMD =- 1. 46, 95 % CI: - 2. 16, - 0. 76; P< 0. 001). Moreover, OFC had significantly higher response rate (RR = 1. 35, 95 % CI: 1. 12, 1. 63; P= 0. 001) and remission rate (RR = 1. 71, 95 % CI: 1. 31, 2. 23; P< 0. 001).

Conclusion: OFC {{is more effective than}} olanzapine or fluoxetine monotherapy in the treatment of patients with TRD. Our results provided supporting evidence for the use of OFC in TRD. However, considering the limitations in this study, more large-scale, well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm these findings.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of different definitions of remission in a large multinational cross-sectional cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: The Questionnaires in Standard Monitoring of Patients with RA (QUEST-RA) database, which (as of January 2008) included 5, 848 patients receiving usual care at 67 sites in 24 countries, was used for this study. Patients were clinically assessed by rheumatologists and completed a 4 -page self-report questionnaire. The database was analyzed according to the following definitions of remission: American College of Rheumatology (ACR) definition, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS 28), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), clinical remission assessed using 42 and 28 joints (Clin 42 and Clin 28), patient self-report Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID 3), and physician report of no disease activity (MD remission). RESULTS: The overall <b>remission</b> <b>rate</b> was lowest using the ACR definition of remission (8. 6 %), followed by the Clin 42 (10. 6 %), Clin 28 (12. 6 %), CDAI (13. 8 %), MD remission (14. 2 %), and RAPID 3 (14. 3 %); the <b>rate</b> of <b>remission</b> was highest when remission was defined using the DAS 28 (19. 6 %). The difference between the highest and lowest <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> was >or= 15 % in 10 countries, 5 - 14 % in 7 countries, and < 5 % in 7 countries (the latter of which had generally low <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> [< 5. 5 %]). Regardless {{of the definition of}} remission, male sex, higher education, shorter disease duration, smaller number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were statistically significantly associated with remission. CONCLUSION: The use of different definitions of RA remission leads to different results with regard to <b>remission</b> <b>rates,</b> with considerable variation among countries and between sexes. Reported <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> in clinical trials and clinical studies have to be interpreted in light of the definition of remission that has been used...|$|R
30|$|Similarly, {{patients}} {{with three or}} more depressive symptoms {{were less likely to}} achieve remission, although this outcome did not meet the criteria for statistical significance. However, {{patients with}} a MADRS Total score of ≥ 20 showed similar <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> to those below this depression threshold. The previous post hoc analysis in this same dataset also found that the <b>remission</b> <b>rate</b> (defined as a YMRS Total score of ≤ 12) was not influenced by the number or severity of depressive symptoms (with the exception of the most severely depressed patients, who showed a higher <b>remission</b> <b>rate)</b> (McIntyre et al. 2013 a). It may be that those patients who are the most ill may also be the most responsive to the medications under study; and thus most likely to show a larger degree of improvement.|$|R
40|$|This trial, {{which will}} {{probably}} accrue over 1, 000 patients before it closes, has already demonstrated that high <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> are attainable in large multicenter studies using 'conventional' doses of ara-C.

There is, at the moment, only a borderline difference in the <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> between the two forms of induction therapy but the more intensive regimen of DAT 3 + 10 achieves remission more quickly and requires less supportive care. Analysis {{of the reasons for}} failure to enter remission continues to show that inadequate supportive care remains an important reason why the <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> are not higher. Drug-related deaths in remission, though decreasing gradually in this study, are a disturbing consequence of increasing the intensity of consolidation treatment...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} regular cannabis use on long-term remission of mood symptoms in bipolar spectrum disorders. METHODS: The 24 -month prospective observational study included patients (n= 239) with bipolar I disorder and schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. Participants were classified as regular cannabis users (three times or more per week) or non-users. The primary outcome measure was the achievement of remission on the evaluations during the 24 months. RESULTS: Of the 234 participants for whom data was available, 25 (10. 7 %) were regular cannabis users, and the group comprised significantly more males than females. In the total population, cannabis use {{was significantly associated with}} decreased likelihood of remission during the 24 -month follow-up period. Subgroup analyses showed that cannabis use was significantly associated with lower <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale in females (n= 139) and patients prescribed mood stabilizers alone (n= 151), whereas in males (n= 95) and patients prescribed olanzapine and/or a mood stabilizer (n= 83), cannabis use was significantly associated with lower <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> on the Young Mania <b>Rating</b> Scale. <b>Remission</b> <b>rates</b> were lowest in the concurrent cannabis and tobacco smoking group (n= 22) followed by the tobacco smoking only group (n= 97), and the non-smoker group (n= 116). The post-hoc analysis revealed that all <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> were significantly lower in the concurrent cannabis and the tobacco smoking group compared to the non-smoker group. CONCLUSION: Cannabis use negatively affects the long-term clinical outcome in patients with bipolar spectrum disorders. A comprehensive assessment and integrated management of cannabis use are required to achieve better treatment outcomes for bipolar spectrum disorders...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Graves' disease (GD) is an {{autoimmune}} disease affecting the thyroid gland and eyes and is treated with three therapeutic modalities. This prospective {{study was designed}} to find out the outcome of patients with GD treated with thionamides, radioactive iodine (RAI) or surgery in an iodine deficient region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six nonsmoking patients (mean age 38. 9 +/- 13. 7 years) with GD were enrolled and followed for a mean period of four years. They were analyzed with respect to their treatment options and their outcome. Results: <b>Remission</b> <b>rate</b> by thionamides was 74. 4 % in the first year but decreased to 65. 1 % in the following four years (p= 0. 0001). <b>Remission</b> <b>rate</b> achieved in the second year did not predict long-term remission with thionamides. Long-term <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> for RAI and surgery were 100 % during about seven years of follow-up. These <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> for RAI and surgery were reached in the first year and did not reveal a statistically significant change in the following years. Thyroidectomy, both subtotal and total, was carried out without any complication. Graves' ophthalmopathy emergence and progression were not found to be correlated with the preferred therapeutic modality of thyrotoxicosis. Conclusion: Long-term thionamide therapy offered a relatively low <b>rate</b> of long-term <b>remission</b> in a region with iodine deficiency. Two years of remission achieved by thionamides did not predict long-term remission in patients living in iodine-deficient areas. RAI and thyroidectomy in experienced hands proved to be better therapeutic alternatives that can be carried out safely...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Treatment of {{depression}} {{should result in}} the absence of symptoms, i. e. remission, in order to restore the functional status of the patient and reduce the risk for relapse. The study assessed the current <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> in primary care and determined the influencing factors. METHODS: 10 consecutive depressive patients treated by antidepressants for at least 3 months and not more than 12 months were screened by each investigator. <b>Remission</b> <b>rates</b> were defined using the Hamilton-Depression scale 7 items (score of 3 or less) as well as the Carroll self rating scale (score of 7 or less). In addition, patients completed the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Initial severity {{of depression}}, type of treatment and socio-economic factors were collected. RESULTS: 292 general practitioners screened a total of 2630 patients. Results indicated low remission rates: 28. 3 % according to the clinician and 17. 1 % according to the patient. Absence of remission was associated with higher impairment in work, social and family life. The most frequently reported residual symptoms in nonremitters were general somatic symptoms (92 %), depressed mood (92 %), psychic anxiety (91 %) and impaired work and activities (89 %). No differences were observed in <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> between men and women. <b>Remission</b> <b>rates</b> were significantly lower in patients living alone as compared to those living in couple or family (25. 1 % vs 30. 2 %, p= 0. 03), in patients with lower education (21. 3 % vs 32. 3 %, p< 0. 001), in patients speaking French as compared to Dutch (24. 0 % vs 34. 0 % p< 0. 001), and unemployed patients compared to patients having an occupation (17. 1 % vs 39. 0 %, p< 0. 001). Higher initial severity and number of previous episodes decreased <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: This study shows low <b>remission</b> <b>rates</b> in depressed patients treated in general practice. The absence of remission is associated with impairment in work, social and family life. Special attention should be given to identify patients who do not reach remission. Peer reviewe...|$|R
