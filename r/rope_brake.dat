40|$|Belay {{devices and}} <b>rope</b> <b>brakes</b> are an {{integral}} part of climbing equipment, required for personal protection such as injury prevention or life saving purposes. In spite of mushrooming design improvement the malfunctioning of brakes is reported repeatedly, caused by handling mistakes or un-optimised design. This review article provides a detailed discussion of the evolution and the design of <b>rope</b> <b>brakes</b> and introduces a new design classification. Design varieties are examined and addressed in detail. Subsequently, the mechanics of <b>rope</b> <b>brakes</b> are reviewed and the differences between dynamic and static belaying are compared as to static and kinetic friction as well as belt and linear friction. In this critical review of modelling and testing of <b>rope</b> <b>brakes,</b> we discuss misconceptions as well as improvements. The issues covered in this review article aim to highlight the problems and challenges which the design of <b>rope</b> <b>brakes</b> and belay devices is facing in the quest for developing an optimised brake which never fails and which is ready to use without training. The shortcomings of modelling and testing of <b>rope</b> <b>brakes</b> are mainly due to neglecting kinetic friction, which disadvantageously affects design optimisation but also opens design opportunities...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDynamic <b>rope</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{integral}} {{elements of the}} standard belaying equipment. They multiply the hand force of the belayer and convert {{a fraction of the}} falling climber’s kinetic energy into thermal energy. As the rope is deflected by the brake, the thermal energy is produced by belt friction. This paper introduces a brake model based on static and viscous belt friction. The contact angles of three different brakes (figure-of-eight, ATC and HMS [Munter hitch]) were determined. These data as well as data taken and/or derived from the literature served as input for the model. The static and viscous belt friction coefficients range between 0. 2 – 0. 3 and 0. 015 – 0. 04, respectively, for the three brakes. Depending on the magnitude of the friction coefficients, three conditions can be distinguished: (1) no rope slip at high friction; (2) rope slip and stop; (3) critical braking; and (4) continuous rope slip (no stop). The window of the friction coefficients between no slip and critical braking is independent of the hand force. However, the smaller the hand force is, the larger are the friction coefficients at no slip and critical braking. Belayers with smaller hand forces should therefore avoid <b>rope</b> <b>brakes</b> with small static and viscous friction coefficients (like the Figure-ofEight) and apply the ATC or HMS...|$|R

40|$|Conveyors are {{prevalent}} in many sectors of industry, especially in mining. Steel-cord rubber belt {{is one of}} the most important parts of a conveyor. Durability of the belt depends mainly on the steel-cord durability. The steel-cord consists of hundred or more steel wire ropes. When a conveyer belt is in use the ropes can be broken or corroded. Besides, rope splice damage is possible. The most of steel cord defects are not visible because of their location inside rubber. Magnetic method of NDT is usual to detect the steel <b>rope</b> <b>brakes</b> inside the belts. But the existing magnetic NDT instruments are rather heavy. The new INTROCON instrument was developed in 2003 - 2004. A scanner with set of eddy current probes installed at the belt under test surface is significantly lighter than magnetic one and can work at the gap up to (10 - 20) mm between them and the belt. The INTROCON was tested at iron and coal pit conveyors. It allows to get, to remember and to display data on steel cord condition in-situ. Using the WINCON soft an operator can get information on rope breaks, corrosion, splice damages and their locations. The INTROCON has been using in mining industry in Russia with high efficiency since 2004...|$|R

Introduction: The following tests were made on the {{compressed air}} plant in the Engineering Laboratory of the Kansas State Agricultural College. The plant is equipped as follows: a vertical engine the make and rated horse power of which are unknown, belted, through a main shaft, to a double acting, horizontal, piston compressor manufactured by the Ingersoll-Sergeant Drill company, and rated at from 8 to 13 horse power depending on the revolution, piston compressor manufactured by the Ingersoll-Sergeant Drill Company, and rated at from 8 to 13 horse power depending on the revolutions per minute and the receiver pressure. A Westinghouse engine with two 6 x 8 single acting cylinders {{was connected to the}} air receiver and used as an air motor. The object of the tests was to determine 1 st the efficiency of the plant, or the ratio of the developed brake horse power of the motor to the indicated horse power of the engine; 2 nd the efficiency between the engine and compressor cylinders, and between the compressor cylinder and the brake on the motor; 2 rd the horse power lost in heating the air and the cooling water. A series of three tests was conducted, the duration of each of which was one hour. Indicator cards were taken on the engine and compressor every five minutes throughout the test; as there was no means of taking cards on the air motor, a <b>rope</b> <b>brake</b> was constructed and used instead. Every five minutes, {{at the same time that}} the indicator cards instead. Every five minutes, at the same time that the indicator cards were taken, the speeds of the engine compressor and motor were noted, and at the same time, the initial and final temperatures of the air and cooling water, and the readings of the scale of the <b>rope</b> <b>brake</b> on the motor were taken. All water which passed through the water jacket of the compressor was carefully weighed and recorder, so that the total weight of water which passed through the jacket during the test was known...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: In a {{previous}} paper the flow and free running speed characteristics of dental air turbine handpieces were discussed. The present work was {{to continue the}} analysis and characterization of these handpieces by addressing the issues of torque, power generation, efficiency and the specification of figures of merit to aid comparative testing and selection. Methods: Using {{the principle of the}} <b>rope</b> <b>brake,</b> torque was determined from stall to free running at a variety of supply pressures for fourteen models of handpiece. Using previous results for air flow rate and free running speed, power and efficiency were calculated. Results: Stall torque was demonstrated to depend on rotor position. Dynamic torque was found to closely approach the expected linear relationship over the range from stall to free running. Several figures of merit (performance indices) were identified which might be used for routine rating and specification of handpieces. Conclusions: Standardized testing can now be performed and effective figures of merit derived to characterize the behaviour of dental air turbine handpieces. © 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Climbing {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing extreme sports and this is {{reflected}} in the exponentially evolving equipment design. Mountaineering equipment is focused mainly on safety, prevention of injuries and protection from falls. Fall protection equipment comprises ropes, belay devices (<b>rope</b> <b>brakes),</b> energy absorbers and harnesses, as well as safety mats for bouldering. Shoes, crampons, ice axes and chalk improve friction and grip. Helmets protect the head primarily from falling rocks and secondarily from impacts in the event of a fall. Traditional alpine mountaineering has evolved into different climbing disciplines, such as sport climbing on natural rock faces and artificial climbing centres, characterised by routes equipped with permanent anchors; lead climbing, speed climbing and bouldering, the classical disciplines of climbing competitions; top roping; high-altitude mountaineering; ice climbing; dry tooling (combination of ice and rock climbing); &# 039;via ferrata&# 039; climbing (with pre-installed safety equipment such as ladders and iron cables); and free climbing and soloing disciplines, where the strength of a rope is merely replaced by mental toughness. The growth rate and popularity of sport climbing was triggered by the introduction of artificial outdoor climbing centres, climbing gyms and even indoor ice-climbing facilities, which make the sport more accessible. Modern design of climbing equipment is driven by innovation and constrained by safety standards. The general design principle is finding the optimum balance of minimising the weight and improving the strength of equipment. This chapter covers selected aspects of ropes and karabiners and discusses the mechanics and tribology of belay devices, friction anchors and chalk...|$|R
50|$|The {{final and}} {{successful}} erection event {{was organized by}} Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, {{it could have been}} done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used <b>brake</b> <b>ropes</b> to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15° had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used <b>brake</b> <b>ropes</b> again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.|$|R

The entire investigation performance of diesel engine is carried in two phases using the 100 % diesel in the first phases and the MTBE blended with diesel fuels in the second phase. The MTBE blended diesel fuels are prepared in the different proportions of 5 % & 10 % MTBE blends. The experimental performance consists of a diesel engine coupled with <b>rope</b> <b>brake</b> dynamometer. All the experiments are perform at a constant speed of 1500 rpm by varying the load and then data obtained from the experiments are {{used to evaluate the}} performance parameters of diesel engine. It is investigated that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of diesel engine using MTBE blends were decreased as the amount of blends increased in diesel. The BTE of diesel engine using 5 % and 10 % blends are 25. 26 % & 24. 65 % respectively that is less from 26. 35 % than that of diesel. The brake specific energy consumption of 5 & 10 percent of MTBE blends consumed higher energy in comparison to diesel fuel during tested on diesel engine. It is investigated that the brake specific fuel consumption of diesel engine using MTBE blends are increased for all brake load than that of diesel fuel...|$|E
40|$|The air {{conditioning}} system of automobiles is mainly uses Vapour Compression Refrigerant System (VCRS) which absorbs and removes heat from the space to be cooled and throws out the heat to atmosphere. In vapour compression refrigerant system, the system utilizes power from engine shaft as the input power to drive the compressor of the refrigeration system, hence the engine has to produce extra work to run the compressor of the refrigerating system utilizing extra amount of fuel. This loss of power {{of the motor vehicle}} for refrigeration can be ignored by utilizing another refrigeration system i. e. a Vapour Absorption Refrigerant System (VARS). As well known the machines based on VARS required low grade energy for operation. Hence in such types of system, a physicochemical process replaces the mechanical process of the VCRS by utilizing energy in the form of heat rather than mechanical work.

50|$|The Denniston Incline began {{operation}} in April 1880. It was a self-acting ropeway that used gravity to lower 12.5 ton gross laden weight New Zealand Railways' coal wagons {{one at a}} time from Brakehead, at Denniston, at the top to Conns Creek below. Each descending wagon hauled an empty one up the incline by means of wire ropes, each wagon attached to its own <b>rope</b> and <b>brake</b> drum. The two drums were mounted beside each other on a common shaft, and the wire rope wound in opposite directions on each drum. So while one drum was letting the rope out and lowering a full wagon down the incline, the other drum was winding its rope in and pulling an empty wagon up the incline. Hydraulic pistons slowed the rotation of the winding drums to control the speed of the wagons.|$|R

40|$|A {{new kind}} of {{mitigation}} measure against debris flows are flexible barriers. Compared to similar barriers against rockfall, where the impacting rock is well modelable by a rigid body, {{the interaction between the}} two-phase medium debris flow and the flexible barrier is quite unknown. It is therefore the aim to develop a load model {{that can be used for}} both dimension-ing in practice and numerical simulation. FLEXIBLE BARRIERS AGAINST DEBRIS FLOWS The investigated barriers consist of ring-nets, spanned by support <b>ropes</b> with integrated <b>brake</b> elements (Fig. 1). They can be installed easily and efficiently up to 15 m width without and up to 30 m with posts. They are most appropriate to act as a debris flow barrier in a rather narrow torrent channel or – if combined to a series of barriers – as an alternative to traditional check dams. Depending on the local conditions of an installed barrier, the benefits are trapped sediment volumes, decreased debris flow energy or river bed stabilization. The load bearing principles are taken from analogue rockfall barriers. Applied against debris flows, their granular material is restrained but water and small particles are let through. The remaining load originates from the impact of the granular phase. A new research project now develops a load model that can be used for an optimized design of such barriers. It consists of an extensive experimental programme and corresponding numerical simulation...|$|R
