40|$|For inany years, {{precision}} {{investment casting}} foundries have periodically reported serious casting defects. One source {{is associated with}} the brittle ceramic shell mould which is very weak in tension and highly expose to the cracking mechanism. This situation not only lead to the appearance of defect in the end cast product but always attribute to the handling problem at the earlier stage in the investment casting industry. Due to this fact the strengthening mechanism of the brittle sllell mold using reinforcement method was studied and investigated in this work. Rice husk was chosen as a reinforcement material as it contains silica element which can withstand high temperature of molten metal. Several testing procedures and characterization technique were carried out in order to measure the performance of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>shell</b> mould. Results show that the MOR value for the green <b>reinforced</b> <b>shell</b> mould is higher than the green body of non <b>reinforced</b> <b>shell</b> mould. Scanning electron microscope observations also show that the fiber alignment across the matrix structure increase the failure resistance and yet increase the strength of the shell mould green body. Furthermore, this reinforcement method using organic fiber leads to the pore enhancement and also leads to the new phase formation (zircon) in the fired reinforced body. Overall, this reinforcement method using rice husk increase the properties of the green and fired body of ceramic shell mould system...|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the construction of thin <b>reinforced</b> <b>shell</b> concrete roofs was widespread in Europe. This roof is of the type where a cylindrical shell with a span of between 3. 00 and 5. 00 m span is built among arches that give the shape of the roof. These arches have a tie beam to resist thrusts and there is therefore only a vertical reaction on the piers. Arches are placed at the bottom side of the shell. At this period concrete was considered to be an elastic and lineal material that obeyed Hooke's law and the arches were therefore analysed in these terms...|$|E
30|$|According to Table  4, when <b>reinforced</b> <b>SHELL</b> 181 {{element is}} used, and in {{comparison}} with SHELL 41 element option, lower stresses are resulted.

40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{detecting}} {{the location of}} structural damage in an aircraft fuselage using modal test data are presented. Both methods use the dynamically measured static flexibility matrix, which is assembled {{from a combination of}} measured modal vectors, frequencies, and driving point residual flexibilities.

The first method detects damage as a softening in the point flexibility components, which are the diagonal entries in the flexibility matrix. The second method detects damage from the disassembled elemental stiffnesses as determined using a presumed connectivity. Vibration data from a laser vibrometer is used to measure the modal mechanics of a DC 9 aircraft fuselage before and after induced weakening in a longitudinal stringer.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there are more}} and more {{structures}} made of composite materials, especially in the form of thin-walled shells, being applied in various fields of technology. When using composite materials such as concrete or fiberglass, reinforcing elements are often placed along the axes of the curvilinear coordinate system of the shell, and in this case, the structure can be considered as orthotropic. There are a lot of papers on the calculation of orthotropic shells, but they do not adequately investigate a number of important factors that influence the stress-strain state of the shell and its stability. In particular, the calculation of <b>reinforced</b> <b>shells</b> does not take into account such factors as in-plane shear, shear and torsional stiffness of ribs, etc. The paper presents the mathematical model of deformation of thin orthotropic shells of revolution, based on the model of Timoshenko – Reissner. The model takes into account the design of reinforcement with the shear and torsional stiffness of the ribs, geometric nonlinearity and also the irregular shape of the shell. Possibility of application of methods and algorithms which are used in the study of isotropic shells is shown.

40|$|In this paper, the {{ultimate}} load capacities of shell foundations on unreinforced and reinforced sand {{were determined by}} laboratory model tests. A series of loading tests were carried out on model shell footing with and without single layer of reinforcement.

The experimental studies indicated that, {{the ultimate}} load capacity of shell footing on reinforced subgrade is higher than those on unreinforced cases and the load settlement curves were significantly modified. The shell foundation over reinforced subgrade {{can be considered a}} good method to increase the effective depth of the foundation and decrease the resulting settlement.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{reinforced}} concrete shell structures. First, {{the historical development of}} those extraordinary and spectacular structures is shortly presented. Geometrical shapes, {{that have been}} used when designing reinforced shells are discussed next: some of the shapes can be relatively easily mathematically described, some have been obtained experimentally, and others can be only given by using computational surface geometry. Main phenomena that define behavior of reinforced concrete shells are described: membrane and bending states, unextensible deformations, buckling (snap through, bifurcation buckling) and imprefection sensitivity. Numerical procedures that should be used when analyzing and designing of <b>reinforced</b> <b>shell</b> structures are roughly presented. Finally, a reinforced concrete shell shape of hyperbolic paraboloid is analysed and designed. Snow and wind loads on the shell are defined by using Eurocodes and results of computational fluid dynamics analysis. The linear and geometrically nonlinear static and linear buckling analyses were performed. The real critical buckling factor has been estimated; it is 1, 19 for the design load, while the computed corresponding critical linear buckling factor was much higher, 8. 1.

40|$|This work uses {{different}} {{finite element}} {{approaches to the}} free vibration analysis of <b>reinforced</b> <b>shell</b> structures, and a simplified model of a typical launcher with two boosters is used as an example. The results obtained using a refined one-dimensional (1 D) beam model are compared to those obtained with commercial finite element software. The 1 D models {{that are used in}} the present work are based on the Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF), which assumes a variable kinematic displacement field over the cross-sections of the beam. Two different sets of polynomials that correspond to Taylor (TE) or Lagrange (LE) expansions were used. The analyses focused on three reinforced structures: a stiffened panel, a reinforced cylinder and the complete structure of the launcher. The frequencies and natural modes obtained using one-dimensional models are compared to those obtained from classical finite element analysis. The classical FE models were built using a beam-shell or solid elements, and the results indicate that the refined beam models can in fact be used to investigate the behavior of very complex reinforced structures. These models can predict the shell-like modes that are typical of thin-walled structures that cannot be detected using classical beam models. The refined 1 D models used in the present work provide results that are as accurate as those from solid FE models, but the 1 D models have a much lower computational cos...|$|E

30|$|Results in Fig.  14 {{show that}} the {{agreement}} between VecTor 2 and ANSYS results is reasonably good. Furthermore, SHELL 41 and <b>reinforced</b> <b>SHELL</b> 181 result in almost similar results for the force–displacement curve. For the retrofitted specimens, finite element results overestimate the load capacity of the both retrofitted specimens. According to Mahini’s (2005) declaration, for RSM 1 specimen and at the peak load, concrete crushing occurred at {{the face of the}} column, which was followed by the rupture of FRP. It was observed that the specimen exhibited a brittle failure mode constituting of concrete crushing, FRP buckling and debonding. In both specimens, concrete cover of the compression zone started to spall off at the peak load stage. In this study concrete spalling and FRP to concrete surface debonding were not modeled. Therefore, as expected the finite element results obtained from VecTor 2 and ANSYS do not show any softening. VecTor 2 results show small softening at the end of loading. However, this softening is a result of material softening not concrete spalling. There are several researchers that have modeled bond slip between FRP and concrete. Recently, Biscaia et al. (2013) have presented a load–displacement behavior model for bond-slip between FRP and concrete. Hawileh et al. (2012) utilized interface cohesion element for modeling debonding of FRP plates using ANSYS program. They concluded that the developed finite element models are capable of accurately predicting and capturing capacity the debonding failure mode of RC beams strengthened with FRP plates. Kim and Vecchio (2008) used a two-node link element in VecTor 2 program for modeling FRP-retrofitted portal frame. Due to lack of adequate information, debonding between FRP and concrete was not modeled in this study. As shown in Fig.  14, VecTor 2 exhibits a stiffer post-yield behavior in comparison with ANSYS. Furthermore, material softening which is considered in the VecTor 2 model does not {{have a significant impact on}} the structural results.|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{structural}} models, {{based on}} variable one-, two-, and three-dimensional kinematics, are proposed {{in this paper}} and applied {{to the analysis of}} the free vibration of reinforced aircraft shell structures. The used models go beyond classical structural theories, that is, Euler-Bernoulli (for one-dimensional beams) and Kirchhoff (for two-dimensional plates) type assumptions. The order of the expansion of the displacement fields over the cross section (one-dimensional case) and along the plate thickness (two-dimensional case) is, in fact, a free parameter of the problem. In this paper, Lagrange polynomials are used to build such expansions, and as a consequence, only displacements are used as the problem unknowns (no rotations or derivatives of displacements, which are typical of one-dimensional/two-dimensional classical theories, are introduced). The finite-element method is used to provide numerical solutions. The related arrays and the governing dynamical equations are written in terms of a few fundamental nuclei according to the Carrera unified formulation. Classical three-dimensional finite-element solid models are also considered. One-, two-, and three-dimensional finite elements are easily connected to each other to make the most appropriate computational model of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>shell</b> structures. The capability to use the same fundamental nucleus to derive finite-element matrices of one-, two-, and three-dimensional elements of the present model is unique because it is usually not available in other finite-element formulations, that is, no ad hoc techniques are required in the present case to couple finite elements with different kinematics. Three main benchmarks have been analyzed: a plate stiffened by means of bidirectional I-stiffeners, a simplified model of a complete aircraft, and a fuselage-wing connection. Comparison with commercial finite-element software (MSC Nastran) is provided for most of the quoted numerical investigations. The modal assurance criterion has been used to compare the free-vibration modes of the different models. The present mathematical models appear closer to reality and cheaper, from the computational point of view, than those of other existing formulations. Carrera unified-formulation-based finite elements do not require the definition of virtual lines (beam axes) or virtual surfaces (plate reference surfaces), and only physical lines/surfaces are therefore used...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{have been considered}} for many years as the major advance {{in the construction of}} energy efficient aerospace structures. Notable advances have been made in understanding the special design considerations that set composites apart from the usual "isotropic" engineering materials such as the metals. As a result, a number of significant engineering designs have been accomplished. However, one shortcoming of the currently favored composites is their relatively unforgiving behavior with respect to failure (brittleness) under seemingly mild impact conditions and large efforts are underway to rectify that situation, much along the lines of introducing thermoplastic matrix materials. Because of their relatively more pronounced (thermo) viscoelastic behavior these materials respond with "toughness" in fracture situations. From {{the point of view of}} applications requiring material strength, this property is highly desirable. This feature impacts several important and distinct engineering problems which have been' considered under this grant and cover the 1) effect of impact damage on structural (buckling) stability of composite panels, the 2) effect of time dependence on the progression of buckling instabilities, and the 3) evolution of damage and fracture at generic thickness discontinuities in structures. The latter topic has serious implications for structural stability problems (buckling failure in <b>reinforced</b> <b>shell</b> structures) as well as failure progression in stringer-reinforced shell structures. This grant has dealt with these issues. Polymer "toughness" is usually associated with uncrosslinked or thermo-plastic polymers. But, by comparison with their thermoset counterparts they tend to exhibit more pronounced time dependent material behavior; also, that time dependence can occur at lower temperatures which places restriction in the high temperature use of these "newer and tougher" materials that are not quite so serious with the thermoset matrix materials. From a structural point of view the implications of this material behavior are potentially severe in that structural failure characteristics are no longer readily observed in short term qualification tests so characteristic for aerospace structures built from typical engineering metals...|$|E

40|$|Textile {{reinforced}} concrete (TRC) is an innovative composite material {{consisting of a}} fine grained concrete and a non-corroding textile reinforcement made of high strength carbon or alkali-resistant glass fibers. Due to the non-corroding textile fabrics thin-walled, light-weight structures can be constructed with TRC. In Germany in two collaborative research centers, one at RWTH Aachen University and the other at the Technical University Dresden, the new composite material was systematically investigated in recent years. Based on interdisciplinary research results experimental and numerical methods {{have been developed for}} material characterization giving a deeper insight in the complex material behavior of the new composite material. The high application potential of TRC in the construction industry has been demonstrated by various application examples ranging from large-sized facade elements, self-supporting sandwich panels to pedestrian bridges. Furthermore, the innovative composite has a high application potential in the field of strengthening of existing steel {{reinforced concrete}} structures. The material characteristics of TRC are also particularly attractive for filigree concrete shell structures as the flexible textile fabrics can be easily adapted to complex curved geometries. Due to their low weight TRC structures can be efficiently fabricated as precast elements and mounted on site. Compared to conventional steel <b>reinforced</b> <b>shell</b> structures using labor-intensive formworks the technical challenges arising in the context of TRC constructions shift to lifting, adjusting and coupling of the individual precast elements. As the dimensioning approaches developed within the collaborative research center mainly focus on linear structural elements such as truss and beam elements they had to be adopted to spatial structures and general loading conditions. Therefore a dimensioning approach for TRC shell structures with combined normal and bending loading has been developed. The underlying n-m interaction diagram is based on the cross-sectional strength characteristic of the composite. The nonlinear load-bearing behavior of TRC shell structures including stress redistribution has been investigated with a formulated anisotropic damage model. Starting point of the developed calibration procedure for the material model is the characteristic strain-hardening response of the composite material measured in the tensile tests. In order to provide a reproducible material characterization suitable test setups for TRC are needed. The developed experimental and numerical concepts are described in detail and exemplified for two TRC shell structures recently constructed at RWTH Aachen University. Furthermore, the fabrication technique applied for TRC shell structures is described differing strongly from the approaches used for conventional steel reinforced concrete. Especially the high positional accuracy within the cross-section of the filigree TRC shells requires innovative solutions...|$|E
