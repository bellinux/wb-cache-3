25|$|After her {{delivery}} {{from the}} Free City of Danzig Sanct Svithun was employed on the passenger/freight line between Bergen in Western Norway and various ports in Northern Norway. In 1931 she was rebuilt with a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>hold</b> to enable her to transport fresh {{fish from the}} fisheries in Northern Norway. During the rebuild she was also fitted with wireless telegraphy. She was a popular ship amongst her passengers, with a large superstructure and a spacious promenade deck with a look-out salon in the bow area. Sanct Svithun was {{also known as a}} superbly seaworthy vessel.|$|E
50|$|The 5,000-ton steel-hulled {{ship was}} built by William Denny and Brothers of Dumbarton, Scotland, and {{launched}} on 19 June 1905. At 400 feet in length and 50 feet in the beam, she was powered by three Parsons turbines, giving her a speed of 17.5 knots. She could carry up to 420 passengers: 240 in 1st class, 120 in 2nd and 60 in 3rd, and also had a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>hold.</b> Accommodation for first class passengers included a dining room, smoking room, and music room with Bechstein grand piano. The ship was lit by electricity, and was fitted with all the latest safety equipment, which included Clayton sulphur dioxide fire extinguishers.|$|E
50|$|A major use of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>hold</b> type ships {{was for the}} {{transportation}} of bananas and frozen meat, {{but most of these}} ships have been partly replaced by refrigerated containers that have a refrigeration system attached to the rear end of the container. While on a ship these containers are plugged into an electrical outlet (typically 440 VAC) that ties into the ship's power generation. Refrigerated container ships are not limited by the number of refrigeration containers they can carry, unlike other container ships which may be limited in their number of refrigeration outlets or have insufficient generator capacity. Each reefer container unit is typically designed with a stand-alone electrical circuit and has its own breaker switch that allows it to be connected and disconnected as required. In principle each individual unit could be repaired while the ship was still underway.|$|E
50|$|She {{had three}} {{passenger}} decks with cabins for 96 first class passengers, public rooms and open-air deck spaces, centered between four large <b>refrigerated</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>holds,</b> two forward and two aft, that could handle 140,000 stems (1,750 tons) of bananas.|$|R

The ship contained twenty-four conventional lifeboats, two speedboats, and two backup canoes. As part of the ship's post-World War II overhaul, it received sophisticated fire-detection systems. This overhaul resulted in the ship's gross tonnage increasing to 27,666 tons. It had eight large <b>cargo</b> <b>holds,</b> one of which could transport unpackaged cars, and two allowed the transport of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>cargo.</b>|$|R
