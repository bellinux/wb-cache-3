5|$|Ownership of {{the timber}} land {{around the tree}} was {{eventually}} acquired by the Cole and Crane <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> <b>Trust,</b> which leased the timbering rights to the North East Lumber Company. Under the lease agreement, the North East Lumber Company only paid for the lumber that it cleared from the land. The company found the Mingo Oak too large to cut down, and assessed that its removal was too costly to undertake. The Cole and Crane <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> <b>Trust</b> also leased out the land where the tree was located to the Island Creek Coal Company for mining.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission's lease from the Cole and Crane <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> <b>Trust,</b> the North East Lumber Company, and the Island Creek Coal Company, the lease for the land around the former tree reverted to the Island Creek Coal Company {{following}} the tree's death and felling.|$|E
5|$|The {{land around}} the tree {{continued}} to be developed. A highway connecting Logan to Williamson, was built parallel to the Trace Fork of Pigeon Creek, opposite the Mingo Oak. While the tree had long been known for its size, the unique status of the Mingo Oak was not recognized until 1931, when John Keadle and Leonard Bradshaw of Williamson took measurements of the tree, and {{found it to be}} the largest living white oak in the world. Upon this finding by the two men, Cole and Crane <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> <b>Trust</b> and the Island Creek Coal Company agreed to make a joint deed conveying the property to the state of West Virginia. In late 1931, Emmett Keadle of the West Virginia Oil and Grease Company wrote a letter to Governor William G. Conley informing him of the tree's significance and the companies' willingness to lease the land to the state. Governor Conley responded to Keadle and suggested the companies convey the property to the West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission.|$|E

Various estimates place the Mingo Oak's seeding between 1354 and 1361 AD. Using borings from the tree, the Smithsonian Institution determined that the Mingo Oak was the oldest tree of its species.

The commission removed vegetation from the immediate land around the tree, constructed a fence around the plot, and built a bridge crossing the Trace Fork of Pigeon Creek so that motorists could access the park from the highway. The state built cooking ovens, picnic tables, and benches along the tree's southern slopes. Also, due to its enormous size and advanced age, the Mingo Oak acquired spiritual and inspirational significance. It became a place of worship, and a pulpit and benches were built beneath its branches. During the summer months, outdoor sermons were delivered by preachers at the tree. The Mingo Oak was also credited with raising awareness of conservation.|$|E
