Although the monograph was primarily concerned with the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> from their homes it was also used for political purposes to discourage women from working and leaving their children in daycare by governments concerned about maximising employment for returned and returning servicemen. The publication was also highly controversial with, amongst others, psychoanalysts, psychologists and learning theorists, and sparked significant debate and research {{on the issue of}} children's early relationships.|$|E

25|$|The Republicans {{oversaw the}} {{evacuation}} of 30,000–35,000 children from their zone, starting with Basque areas, from which 20,000 were evacuated. Their destinations included the United Kingdom and the USSR, and many other locations in Europe, along with Mexico. On 21 May 1937, around 4,000 Basque children {{were taken to the}} UK on the aging steamship SS Habana from the Spanish port of Santurtzi. This was against initial opposition from both the government and charitable groups, who saw the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> from their native country as potentially harmful. On arrival two days later in Southampton, the children were dispersed all over England, with over 200 children accommodated in Wales. The upper age limit was initially set at 12, but raised to 15. By mid-September, all of los niños, as they became known, had found homes with families.

500|$|Bowlby later {{stated that}} he had {{concluded}} that, contrary to the focus of psychoanalysts on the internal fantasy world of the child, the important area to study was how a child was actually treated by his parents in real life {{and in particular the}} interaction between them. He chose the actual <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> from the home at this particular time because it was a specific event, the effects of which could be studied, and because he believed it could have serious effects on a child's development and because it was preventable. In addition, views that he had already expressed about the importance of a child's real life experiences and relationship with carers had been met by [...] "sheer incredulity" [...] by colleagues before World War II. This led him to see that far more systematic knowledge was required of the effects on a child of early experiences. Bowlby and his colleagues were pioneers of the view that studies involving direct observation of infants and children were not merely of interest but were essential to the advancement of science in this area.|$|E

2500|$|The Victorian Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 {{included}} the earliest legislation to authorise child removal from Aboriginal parents. The Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines had been advocating such powers since 1860. Passage of the Act gave the colony of Victoria a wide suite of powers over Aboriginal and [...] "half-caste" [...] persons, including the forcible <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>children,</b> especially [...] "at risk" [...] girls. Through the late 19th and early 20th century, similar policies and legislation were adopted by {{other states and}} territories, such as the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 (Qld), the Aborigines Ordinance 1918 (NT), the Aborigines Act 1934 (SA), and the 1936 Native Administration Act (WA).|$|E

2500|$|The <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> {{from their}} {{families}} and communities brought {{short and long term}} harm to many native communities. While many schools had infirmaries and provided medical care in later decades, abuse of various kinds and crowded conditions in {{the first decades of the}} IRS history led to poor health and even death for a percentage of those enrolled. It has been argued that the psychological and emotional trauma resulting from both the abuse and the removal of the children {{from their families}} and culture has resulted in substance abuse, greater domestic violence, unemployability, and increased rates of suicide. In many cases, children leaving residential schools found themselves at an intersection of cultures, where they were no longer comfortable within their own cultures, yet not accepted into mainstream Canadian culture.

2500|$|International law has {{generally}} recognized {{that there may}} be extenuating circumstances where a child abduction may have been necessary or justifiable due to extenuating circumstances. The 1902 Convention on the Guardianship of minors limited such considerations to strictly emergency situations. Starting with the 1924 Declaration on the Rights of the Child and the 1959 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child there was a growing recognition at the international level of the shift in nation's domestic laws away from parental authority and towards an emphasis on protecting the child, even from their own parents. [...] This foreshadowed the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and led to the establishment of exceptional circumstances in Article 13 of the Hague Abduction Convention where the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> would not be considered child abduction and allow the child to remain in their new country.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{international}} {{child abduction}} is generally synonymous with international parental kidnapping, child snatching, and child stealing. [...] However, the more precise legal usage of {{international child abduction}} originates in private international law and refers to the illegal <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> from their home by an acquaintance or family member to a foreign country. In this context, [...] "illegal" [...] is normally taken to mean [...] "in breach of custodial rights" [...] and [...] "home" [...] {{is defined as the}} child's habitual residence. As implied by the [...] "breach of custodial rights," [...] the phenomenon of international child abduction generally involves an illegal removal that creates a jurisdictional conflict of laws whereby multiple authorities and jurisdictions could conceivably arrive at seemingly reasonable and conflicting custodial decisions with geographically limited application. Such a result often strongly affects a child's access and connection to half their family and may cause the loss of their former language, culture, name and nationality, it violates numerous children's rights, and can cause severe psychological and emotional trauma to the child and family left behind.|$|E
