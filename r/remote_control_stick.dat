50|$|DarwiinRemote employs {{most of the}} {{features}} of the Wii Remote. All three accelerometers feed information to the Mac. All of the buttons on the Wii Remote, including the Nunchuk and classic controller attachments, can be used, and the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> position can be displayed, but {{it is not possible to}} use the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> to <b>control</b> anything. The rumble features and LEDs are fully programmable. In addition, DarwiinRemote can accept the infrared signals from the Wii Sensor Bar. However, to use this feature, the bar must be plugged into a powered socket on a Wii console, or it must be a battery-powered model. One can also, however, use a string of infrared LEDs or a single IR LED from a <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> instead of a sensor bar.|$|R

Electronics are provided to control the motor to eliminate oscillations due to motor torque and high gain due to breakout at the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> when the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> is at about its null position. Both hardware as well as software implementations can provide position dependent dampening to the <b>control</b> <b>sticks</b> such that when the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> is located about a null position, {{a higher rate of}} dampening is provided than when the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> is located outside the null position, when a lower rate of dampening is provided. The system provides a stable active hand controller <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> without degraded force and feel characteristics of the system...|$|R

25|$|Radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> (RF <b>remote</b> <b>control)</b> is used {{to control}} distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> device. As a complementary method to infrared <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> the radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> duplicator because it is able to copy existing <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> in the market.|$|R
5000|$|Mother and Father {{go to get}} a present, leaving Pingu and Pinga at home playing weddings. Theyâ€™re shown a {{remotely}} operated Roomba, which they decide to get. The cleaner and remote are put on the table, and Pingu is intrigued. Mother then comes in and tells Father that she needs a new hat, so they go out to get one, and leave Pingu and Pinga alone at home again. Pingu touches the <b>control</b> <b>stick,</b> and the parcel moves. Pinga comes over to watch, as Pingu pushes the <b>stick</b> on the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> full forward. The parcel takes off and hovers like a helicopter. Pingu finds that pulling the stick back makes it land. Unfortunately, when the parcel lands it over-balances and falls off the table, landing upside down and getting dented.|$|R

50|$|Su-30MKI {{aerodynamic}} configuration is {{a longitudinal}} triplane with relaxed stability. The canard increases the aircraft lift ability and deflects automatically to allow high {{angle of attack}} (AoA) flights allowing it to perform Pugachev's Cobra. The integral aerodynamic configuration combined with thrust vectoring results in extremely capable manoeuvrability, taking off and landing characteristics. This high agility allows rapid deployment of weapons in any direction as desired by the crew. The canard notably assists in controlling the aircraft at large angles-of-attack and bringing it to a level flight condition. The aircraft has a fly-by-wire (FBW) with quadruple redundancy. Dependent on flight conditions, signals from the <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> position transmitter or the FCS may be coupled to <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> amplifiers and combined with feedback signals from acceleration sensors and rate gyros. The resultant control signals are coupled to the high-speed electro-hydraulic actuators of the elevators, rudders and the canard. The output signals are compared and, if the difference is significant, the faulty channel is disconnected. FBW {{is based on a}} stall warning and barrier mechanism which prevents stalls through dramatic increases of <b>control</b> <b>stick</b> pressure, allowing a pilot to effectively control the aircraft without exceeding the angle of attack and acceleration limitations. Although the maximum angle of attack is limited by the canards, the FBW acts as an additional safety mechanism.|$|R
