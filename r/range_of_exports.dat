In 2004 the chief export markets were the United States (which accounted for nearly half), Italy, France, Jordan, Canada, and the Netherlands. In 2004 the value of Iraq’s imports was US$21.7 billion, incurring a trade deficit of about US$5.2 billion. In 2003 the main sources of Iraq’s imports were Turkey, Jordan, Vietnam, the United States, Germany, and Britain. Because of Iraq’s inactive manufacturing sector, the range of imports was quite large, including food, fuels, medicines, and manufactured goods. By 2010, exports rose to US$50.8 billion and imports rose to US$45.2 billion. Chief 2009 export partners were: U.S., India, Italy, South Korea, Taiwan, China, Netherlands, and Japan.

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} six stylized {{facts about}} firms' export prices using detailed customs {{data on the}} universe of Chinese trade flows. First, across firms selling a given product, exporters that charge higher prices earn greater revenues in each destination, have bigger worldwide sales, and enter more markets. Second, firms that export more, that enter more markets and that charge higher export prices import more expensive inputs. Third, across destinations within a firm-product, firms set higher prices in richer, larger, bilaterally more distant and overall less remote countries. Fourth, across destinations within a firm-product, firms earn bigger revenues in markets where they set higher prices. Fifth, across firms within a product, exporters with more destinations offer a wider <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>export</b> prices. Finally, firms that export more, that enter more markets and that offer a wider <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>export</b> prices pay a wider <b>range</b> <b>of</b> input prices and source inputs from more origin countries. We propose that trade models should incorporate two features to rationalize these patterns in the data: more successful exporters use higher-quality inputs to produce higher-quality goods (stylized facts 1 and 2), and firms vary {{the quality of their}} products across destinations by using inputs of different quality levels (stylized facts 3, 4, 5 and 6). ...|$|R
40|$|Small {{states are}} {{economically}} vulnerable {{because of their}} inherent proneness to exogenous shocks over which they can exercise very little control, if any. Such shocks in the main emanate from the small states’ structural openness to international trade, their high dependence on a narrow <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> and their reliance on strategic imports, notably fuel and food.

40|$|Abstract. Theoretically {{countries}} that specialise {{in the production}} of goods and services according to the principle of comparative advantage should experience gains from trade. However, as many small states have come to learn, dependence on a limited <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> and a few trading partners is not always beneficial. If the demand for a main export falls, these countries would experience excessive fluctuations in export receipts that would destabilise their economy. This study presents empirical evidence of this phenomenon by measuring concentration of export goods, services and destinations through eight different export concentration measures. Export concentration, as measured by these indices, exhibits a negative link with country size variables, indicating higher export concentration in smaller countries. The results of this study results also point towards higher export concentration in less developed countries, indicating that both size and the stage of economic development are relevant factors in determining export concentration...|$|E

Whether diversification affects employment opportunities, holding export-ratio constant, is thus worth exploring.|$|R

The economy continues to adjust to the 2014 terms-of-trade shock amid a tense geopolitical context marked by ongoing international sanctions. Oil and gas prices remained low through the first half of 2015, further underscoring Russia’s vulnerability to volatile global commodity markets. The weakening of the ruble created a price advantage for some industries, boosting a narrow <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> and encouraging investment in a certain sectors, but this was not sufficient to generate an overall increase in non-energy exports. Investment demand continued to contract for a third consecutive year. Economic policy uncertainty arising from an unpredictable geopolitical situation and the continuation of the sanctions regime caused private investment to decline rapidly as capital costs rose and consumer demand evaporated. The record drop in consumer demand was driven by a sharp contraction in real wages, which fell by an average of 8. 5 percent {{in the first}} six months of 2015, illustrating the severity of the recession. However, the deterioration of real wages was also the primary mechanism through which the labor market adjusted to lower demand, and unemployment increased only slightly from 5. 3 percent in 2014 to 5. 6 percent {{in the first half}} of 2015.
