25|$|It {{is inconceivable}} that inanimate brute matter should, without the {{mediation}} of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation {{in the sense of}} Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without {{the mediation of}} anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.|$|E

I swear to God, no one knows how lonely I get. And how empty I really feel." [...] Thereafter, Geller supplied him with books on religion and mysticism, which the singer read voraciously. Presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much of his life, taking trunkloads of books with him on tour.|$|E

Show creator Tyra Banks explained to The Boston Herald her decision process: [...] "The <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> hired Janice Dickinson is because I read her book (No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel), and that book represented every single thing that I have never done.

When asked about her future projects and whether she would return to recording pop music as she did before the release of music inspired by Macedonian folklore as in Makedonsko Devojče 1 and Makedonsko Devojče 2 or she would continue {{in the same direction as}} those two albums, Gočeva said that [...] "there is no <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> would not make one more project like that".|$|E

He embraced Christianity until halfway through his teenage years, at which point he concluded that {{the theory of evolution}} was a better explanation for life's complexity, and ceased believing in a god. Dawkins states: [...] "the main residual <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> was religious was from being so impressed with the complexity of life and feeling that it had to have a designer, and I think it was when I realised that Darwinism was a far superior explanation that pulled the rug out from under the argument of design.

500|$|In Alexandria, Owumi {{received}} a satisfactory offer from El-Olympi, a local team coached {{by one of}} Azmy's former players. Going against the will of his family, Owumi chose to follow his coach {{because he did not}} want his relatives to see him in his poor physical and mental state, and he felt that he could recover by playing basketball. He said, [...] "The real <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> didn't come home was I was just too raw. You know, I would look in the mirror, and I couldn't recognize myself." [...] He also believed that a return to basketball would help him slowly reduce the trauma from Libya. However, during his stint, his father fell into a diabetic coma, giving Owumi additional stress. The Nigerian finished the final two weeks of the season with El-Olympi. He led his new team to 13 straight wins, won the championship, and was named postseason MVP.|$|E

Rob Sevier, co-founder of the label The Numero Group, and Games, a collaboration between Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) and Joel Ford, named Rain in England one of their favorite albums of the year. Dean Blunt of the electronic duo Hype Williams admired the album and said, [...] "it was artistic, it was the merit. ... Part of the reason it's so interesting, part of the <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> think this is so good, it's a juxtaposition of two things that you really don't think are meant to be together."

500|$|I {{will not}} go on to other matters without {{pointing}} out to you that I chose the present Ionic order, from amongst all others, in order to ornament and to give lustre to the palace, which Her Majesty the Queen, mother of the most Christian King Charles IX, today is having built at Paris ... The other <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> wanted to use and to show the Ionic order properly, on the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, is because it is feminine and was devised according to the proportions and beauties of women and goddesses, as was the Doric to those of men, {{which is what the}} ancients have told me: for, when they decided to build a temple to a god, they used the Doric, and to a goddess, the Ionic. Yet all architects have not followed that , shown in Vitruvius's text ... accordingly I have made use, at the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, of the Ionic order, on the view that it is delicate and of greater beauty than the Doric, and more ornamented and enriched with distinctive features.|$|E
500|$|When {{he signed}} a {{professional}} football contract with the New York Giants, Timberlake stated {{that he intended to}} take ministerial training at Princeton Theological Seminary during the off-season. [...] He noted, [...] "I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete." [...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I see no <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it." [...] Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible." [...] "You want to go home. [...] You want to quit football. [...] It is times like these when something happens to me. [...] I can't explain it.

500|$|The album {{features}} more positive and uplifting lyrics {{in comparison with}} Green Day's earlier work. Cool noted that, [...] "It's got the sarcasm, it's got the snottiness, but it's got a little {{light at the end}} of the tunnel." [...] Warning also contains more explicitly political themes, as exemplified by tracks such as [...] "Minority". [...] This was inspired by Armstrong's fear that presidential nominee Al Gore was going to lose the 2000 U.S. presidential election and that [...] "someone really conservative" [...] would take office. He recalled, [...] "We've always tried to keep an ear to the ground and keep our eyes open to what's going on...that's one <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> was really taking my time writing songs to really [...] Instead of just writing an overly knee-jerk reaction." [...] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the lyrics of [...] "Minority" [...] serve as [...] "a reminder of the youthful mentality of Green Day's early work". [...] "Misery" [...] tells various stories in its verses, all of which end unhappily. The first verse centers on a girl named Virginia who was a [...] "lot lizard", a term for a prostitute who exchanges sex for money with truck drivers at interstate highway truck stops. [...] "Blood, Sex and Booze" [...] explores the subject of sadomasochism.|$|E

500|$|According to Rod Roddewig, a {{contemporary}} of Wilt's, Chamberlain documented his love life using a Day-Timer. Every time Chamberlain {{went to bed}} with a different woman, he put a check in his Day-Timer. Over a 10-day period, there were 23 checks in the book, {{which would be a}} rate of 2.3 women per day. Chamberlain divided that number in half, to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation. He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive at the time minus 15 years. That was how the 20,000 number came into existence. In response to public backlash regarding his promiscuity, Chamberlain later emphasized that [...] "the point of using the number was to show that sex was a great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life. That's the <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> was single." [...] In a 1999 interview shortly before his death, Chamberlain regretted not having explained the sexual climate {{at the time of his}} escapades, and warned other men who admired him for it, closing with the words: [...] "With all of you men out there who think that having a thousand different ladies is pretty cool, I have learned in my life I've found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much more satisfying." [...] Chamberlain also acknowledged that he never came close to marrying and had no intention of raising any children. However, in 2015 a man named Aaron Levi came forward claiming to be Chamberlain's son based on non-identifying papers from his adoption and information from his biological mother. Chamberlain's sister refused to provide DNA evidence for testing, so Levi's claim is not conclusive.|$|E
