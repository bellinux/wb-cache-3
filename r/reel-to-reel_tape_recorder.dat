5|$|Nick's older sister, Gabrielle, {{became a}} {{successful}} {{film and television}} actress. Both parents were musically inclined and each wrote pieces of music. Recordings of Molly Drake's songs, which have come to light since her death, are remarkably similar in tone and outlook to the later work of her son. Mother and son shared a similar fragile vocal delivery; both Gabrielle and biographer Trevor Dann have noted a parallel sense of foreboding and fatalism in their music. Encouraged by his mother, Drake learned to play piano {{at an early age}} and began to compose songs which he recorded on a <b>reel-to-reel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> she kept in the family drawing room.|$|E
25|$|Clapton {{received}} an acoustic Hoyer guitar, made in Germany, for his thirteenth birthday, but the inexpensive steel-stringed instrument {{was difficult to}} play and he briefly lost interest. Two years later Clapton picked it up again and started playing consistently. Clapton {{was influenced by the}} blues from an early age, and practised long hours to learn the chords of blues music by playing along to the records. He preserved his practice sessions using his portable Grundig <b>reel-to-reel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> listening to them over and over until he felt he'd got it right.|$|E
25|$|For much {{of their}} career, Pentagram rehearsed at the American Mailing {{warehouse}} in Alexandria, {{due to the fact}} that both Liebling and O’Keefe lived in high-rise apartments. The latter’s father, George O’Keefe, was an executive at American Mailing. The younger O’Keefe had used this location for many of his previous musical projects, whether on his own or with Space Meat. At the warehouse, the group was able to have a good practice room to store their equipment and play loudly without the worry of complaining neighbors. Many of these early rehearsals were recorded on O’Keefe's <b>reel-to-reel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> The resulting rehearsal tapes, featuring the many early lineups the group went through in the early 1970s, were later traded extensively among Pentagram fans. When American Mailing moved locations, Pentagram eventually moved to rehearse at Mayne's house, which he was renting with an old friend, locally renowned keyboardist Knox Cockrell.|$|E

500|$|Vaughan and McCartney {{left before}} the evening show which started at 8 o'clock. During the {{performance}} there was an unexpected thunderstorm, which made the lights go out. Bob Molyneux, a young schoolmate from Quarry Bank, recorded part of the performance on his Grundig TK8 portable <b>reel-to-reel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> The tape included versions of Lonnie Donegan's [...] "Puttin' on the Style" [...] and Elvis' [...] "Baby Let's Play House". In 1963, Molyneux offered the tape to Lennon via Ringo Starr, but Lennon never responded, so Molyneux put the tape in a vault.|$|E
500|$|Academics Maria Pramaggiore and Tom Wallis {{remarked that}} Sellers fits the mould of a {{technical}} actor because he displays a mastery of physical characterisation, such as accent or physical trait. Writer and playwright John Mortimer saw {{the process for}} himself when Sellers was about to undertake filming on Mortimer's The Dock Brief and could not decide {{how to play the}} character of the barrister. By chance he ordered cockles for lunch and the smell brought back a memory of the seaside town of Morecambe: this gave him [...] "the idea of a faded North Country accent and the suggestion of a scrappy moustache". So important was the voice as the starting point for character development, that Sellers would walk around London with a <b>reel-to-reel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> recording voices to study at home.|$|E

500|$|In 1958 Sellers starred with David Tomlinson, Wilfrid Hyde-White, David Lodge and Lionel Jeffries as a chief {{petty officer}} in Val Guest's Up the Creek. Guest later {{claimed that he}} had written and {{directed}} the film {{as a vehicle for}} Sellers, and thus had started Sellers's film career. To practice his voice, Sellers purchased a <b>reel-to-reel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> The film received critical acclaim in the United States and Roger Lewis viewed it as an important practice ground for Sellers. Next, Sellers featured with Terry-Thomas as one of a pair of comic villains in George Pal's tom thumb (1958), a musical fantasy film, opposite Russ Tamblyn, Jessie Matthews and Peter Butterworth. Terry-Thomas later said that [...] "my part was perfect, but Peter's was bloody awful. He wasn't difficult about it, but he knew it". The performance was a major landmark in Sellers's career and became his first contact with the Hollywood film industry.|$|E
500|$|Live'r Than You'll Ever Be was {{recorded}} by [...] "Dub" [...] Taylor from Trademark of Quality using a Sennheiser shotgun microphone and a Uher [...] "Report 4000" [...] <b>reel-to-reel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> It {{was the first}} audience-recorded rock bootleg to be mastered and distributed; some sources consider it the first live bootleg. Though the sound {{is not nearly as}} clear as the official release of Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!, the recording is considered to be very strong for an audience recording, especially one of that era. The Rolling Stones performed two sets that night and it is the second concert that was more heavily bootlegged and has sharper sound. Bootleggers had collaborated to record Stones shows across the United States, recording them on two-track Sony recorders for months prior to the release of the album. At least one source claims that the recordings initially came from rock promoter Bill Graham's staff, who used the tapes for broadcast on KSAN and released their edit on Lurch Records in early 1970.|$|E
500|$|Jansch {{moved to}} London where in 1963, at the {{invitation}} of Bob Wilson, a Staffordshire folksinger who was also an art student at St Martin's College of Art, he was asked to take over as resident singer at Bunjies on Great Litchfield Street with Charles Pearce, another art student. They remained in that situation for a year before Pearce moved to South London to run several clubs south of the Thames. There was a burgeoning interest in folk music throughout London by then. There, he met the engineer and producer Bill Leader, at whose home they made a recording of Jansch's music on a <b>reel-to-reel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> Leader sold the tape for £100 to Transatlantic Records, who produced an album directly from it. The album Bert Jansch was released in 1965 and went on to sell 150,000 copies. It included Jansch's protest song [...] "Do You Hear Me Now," [...] which was {{brought to the attention of}} the pop music mainstream later that year by the singer Donovan, who covered it on his Universal Soldier EP, which reached No. 1 in the UK EP chart and No. 27 in the singles chart. Pearce disappeared from Jansch's life after arranging for him to be one of the artists in the Liberal International concert, [...] "Master of the Guitar" [...] at the Royal Festival Hall in 1968. Also included in Jansch's first album was his song [...] "Needle of Death," [...] a stark anti-drugs lament written after a friend died of a heroin overdose.|$|E
5000|$|British <b>Tape</b> <b>Recorders</b> or BTR {{machines}} were <b>reel-to-reel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> initially made by EMI in England after World War II. They {{were the first}} magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> to be manufactured in Britain, and their design imitated that of the <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> used by the Germans during the war.

2500|$|In 1935, {{decades before}} the {{introduction}} of the Compact Cassette, AEG released the first <b>reel-to-reel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> (in German: Tonbandgerät), with the commercial name [...] "Magnetophon". It was based on the invention of the magnetic tape (1928) by Fritz Pfleumer, which used similar technology but with open reels (for which the tape was manufactured by BASF). These instruments were very expensive and relatively difficult to use and were therefore used mostly by professionals in radio stations and recording studios.|$|E
2500|$|Magnitizdat (in Russian магнитиздат) is {{the process}} of re-copying and self distributing live audio tape {{recordings}} in the Soviet Union that were not available commercially. The process of magnitizdat was less risky than publishing literature via samizdat, since any person in the USSR was permitted to own a private <b>reel-to-reel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> while paper duplication equipment was under control of the state. [...] "Tamizdat" [...] refers to literature published abroad (там, tam, meaning [...] "there"), often from smuggled manuscripts.|$|E

He says it [...] "taught me {{how to be a}} producer". In 1966, Lynne joined the line-up of the Nightriders as guitarist. The band would soon change their name to the Idle Race. Despite recording two critically acclaimed albums with the band and producing the second, success eluded him. In 1970, Lynne accepted an offer from friend Roy Wood to join the line-up of the more successful band the Move.|$|E

She earned a B.A. degree in {{musicology}} from the University of California, Berkeley in 1962, directly after which she joined the Peace Corps, which had been founded a year earlier. [...] Traveling to Ethiopia, she was sent to the northern province of Eritrea, where she served as a Peace Corps volunteer from 1962 to 1964. During this time she took it upon herself to conduct ethnomusicological fieldwork, although she had not yet received training in the field. [...] She recorded many types of Eritrean and Ethiopian music (including songs of the Tigray-Tigrinya people), using a borrowed Philips <b>reel-to-reel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> with 3-inch reels. [...] Many of these recordings are now of historical significance, as younger Tigray-Tigrinya people are largely unfamiliar with these songs.|$|E
2500|$|American {{photographer}} Attila von Szalay {{was among}} the first to try recording what he believed to be voices of the dead as a way to augment his investigations in photographing ghosts. He began his attempts in 1941 using a 78 rpm record, but it wasn't until 1956, after switching to a <b>reel-to-reel</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> that he believed he was successful. Working with Raymond Bayless, von Szalay conducted a number of recording sessions with a custom-made apparatus, consisting of a microphone in an insulated cabinet connected to an external recording device and speaker. Szalay reported finding many sounds on the tape that could not be heard on the speaker at the time of recording, some of which were recorded when there was no one in the cabinet. He believed these sounds to be the voices of discarnate spirits. Among the first recordings believed to be spirit voices were such messages as [...] "This is G!", [...] "Hot dog, Art!", and [...] "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all". [...] Von Szalay and Raymond Bayless' work was published by the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research in 1959. Bayless later went on to co-author the 1979 book, Phone Calls From the Dead.|$|E
