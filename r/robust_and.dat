5|$|In general, Megalosaurus had {{the typical}} build {{of a large}} theropod. It was bipedal, the {{horizontal}} torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally <b>robust</b> <b>and</b> probably carrying three digits. Being a carnivore, its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey. The skeleton of Megalosaurus is highly ossified, indicating a <b>robust</b> <b>and</b> muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of Torvosaurus, a close relative.|$|E

This was the first comparative simulation study to include <b>robust</b> PCLOW <b>and</b> <b>robust</b> PCHIGH.

The Carrig D and Bacon MLD were applied using a “natural drop ”approach that separated scores on the metric into two groups: outlying and non-outlying. The “natural drop ”utilizes a k-means algorithm from cluster analysis to separate the scores into the two groups. v Both majority and contaminant observations were generated from multivariate normal distributions based on factor-analytic models. Experimental factors included majority versus contaminant communality level, majority-contaminant factor models scenario, number of variables, sample size and fraction of outliers.

5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos.

There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E

We conclude that there is a precise sense in which robust virtual implementation can be significantly more permissive than robust exact implementation. robust mechanism design; ex post incentive compatibility; robust monotonicity; robust measurability...|$|R

5|$|Dale Russell {{hypothesized}} that the more lightly built and more common Gorgosaurus may have preyed on the abundant hadrosaurs of the time, while the more <b>robust</b> <b>and</b> less common Daspletosaurus may have specialized on the less prevalent but better-defended ceratopsids, {{which may have been}} more difficult to hunt. However, a specimen of Daspletosaurus (OTM 200) from the Two Medicine Formation preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region. The higher and broader muzzles of tyrannosaurines like Daspletosaurus are mechanically stronger than the lower snouts of albertosaurines like Gorgosaurus, although tooth strengths are similar between the two groups. This may indicate a difference in feeding mechanics or diet.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century onwards the Normans {{began to build}} new castles in stone and convert {{existing}} timber designs.

Some wooden castles were not converted into stone for many years and instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{described}} two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. Although {{there was}} no indication of what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and <b>robust,</b> <b>and</b> Leidy gave them the name Deinodon. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but in the absence of skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to unequivocally synonymize the two genera, provisionally naming a ?Deinodon libratus. Although Deinodon teeth are very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to. Deinodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium today. Additional likely synonyms of G. libratus and/or D. horridus include Laelaps falculus, Laelaps hazenianus, Laelaps incrassatus, and Dryptosaurus kenabekides.|$|E
