5|$|A {{concurrent}} use <b>registration,</b> in United States trademark law, {{is a federal}} trademark <b>registration</b> of the same trademark to two or more unrelated parties, with each party having a <b>registration</b> limited to a distinct geographic area. Such a <b>registration</b> is achieved by filing a {{concurrent use}} application (or by converting an existing application to a concurrent use application) and then prevailing in a concurrent use proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ("TTAB"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). A concurrent use application may be filed {{with respect to a}} trademark which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may be allowed to go forward based on the assertion that the existing use can co-exist with the new <b>registration</b> without causing consumer confusion.|$|E

5|$|The Quarter Pony is {{recognized}} by several different breed registries that each have different requirements. The American Quarter Pony Association requires that, although parentage may be unknown, the pony must have conformation that is desirable for breeding and be easily recognizable as having Quarter Pony or Quarter Horse breeding. pinto, leopard complex (Appaloosa), and white horses {{are not eligible}} for <b>registration,</b> nor are gaited ponies. The National Quarter Pony Association requires that stallions be registered with the AQHA before they can be registered with the NQPA. Mares must have one parent registered with the AQHA, be registered with the AQHA themselves, or go through a special <b>registration</b> process. Geldings simply have to be of Quarter Horse type to be eligible for <b>registration.</b> Horses with Pinto or Appaloosa markings, or with excessive white, {{are not eligible for}} <b>registration.</b> The International Quarter Pony Association allows Pinto and Appaloosa markings, and simply requires that ponies be of Quarter-type conformation and good disposition for registry. Any type of pony meeting these requirements may be registered through the hardship <b>registration</b> program, which includes a special inspection. However, if ponies have a parent registered with an approved breed registry (approved breeds include the Quarter Pony, Quarter Horse, Paint horse, Appaloosa and Pony of the Americas), they are automatically eligible for <b>registration,</b> with no inspection required. Crosses with gaited breeds are not accepted for <b>registration.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{reports of}} the grave <b>registration</b> work became public, the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and {{requests}} for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17,000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives.

The Graves <b>Registration</b> Commission became the Directorate of Graves <b>Registration</b> and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave <b>registration</b> and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E

50|$|Greco-Egyptian birth <b>registrations</b> {{were not}} {{compulsory}} {{and were more}} of a certification of status than proof of birth. The census eliminated the need of birth <b>registrations</b> because the information gathered from birth <b>registrations</b> merely supplemented {{the information from the}} census. Age was particularly important for determining who was liable to pay the poll tax at the age of 14 years. Birth <b>registrations</b> could provide the age of the individual; however, the census was held every 14 years to ensure that no one escaped the tax and also provided this information. The census was more efficient and thorough than the system of birth <b>registrations</b> in Greco-Egyptian society, and government officials relied on the information from the census far more than birth <b>registrations.</b>|$|R
