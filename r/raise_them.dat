King Garon kidnaps Sumeragi's young child, the Avatar, and decides to <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> to serve his purposes. Meanwhile, back in Hoshido, without their king, Sumeragi's wife Mikoto becomes the new ruler of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{centre of}} the Maya city was where the ruling elite lived, and where the administrative functions of the city were performed, together with religious ceremonies. It was also where {{the inhabitants of the}} city gathered for public activities. Elite residential complexes occupied the best land around the city centre, while commoners had their residences dispersed further away from the ceremonial centre. Residential units were built on top of stone platforms to <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> above the level of the rain season floodwaters.|$|E

5|$|The serval {{is similar}} to the {{sympatric}} caracal, but has a narrower spoor, a rounder skull, and lacks its prominent ear tufts. The African golden cat is darker, with different cranial features. It resembles the cheetah in its build and coat pattern, though not in size. The serval shares its adaptations to its marshy habitat with the jungle cat; both cats have large and sharp ears that help in locating the prey efficiently, and their long legs <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> above muddy ground and water.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor's Carriage is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The plot is a melodrama that features Marie Eline in the starring role. The film begins with Max, an old musician who has two daughters, {{one of whom is}} blind. Max becomes ill and dies and without a mother to <b>raise</b> <b>them,</b> the younger daughter cares for her older sister, but they are homeless and poor. The little girl begs a doctor to restore her sister's vision and he proposes to her. The film was released on September 9, 1910 and was met with praise from reviewers. The film saw a wide national release and was also shown in Canada, Britain and Australia. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E

25|$|The Mauryas firstly {{looked at}} forests as resources. For them, the most {{important}} forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also battle-elephants; these {{played a role in}} the defeat of Seleucus, one of Alexander's former generals. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less time to catch, tame and train wild elephants than to <b>raise</b> <b>them.</b> Kautilya's Arthashastra contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the Protector of the Elephant Forests.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, the {{majority}} of Japanese national students within Greater New York City attended U.S. schools. To have education in the Japanese language and Japanese literature, they attend the weekend classes offered by the Japanese Weekend School of New York. The parents who select the weekend school and local school combination often wish {{to raise their children}} as international and connected to foreign cultures, while parents choosing the Japanese day schools wish to <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> as typical Japanese children. As of 1988 over 30% of the New York City area parents of school age children selected the full-time NYJS instead of the weekend school and local school combination.|$|E

25|$|In mid June 1940, however, {{following}} the lightning {{advance of the}} Germans through France and the subsequent Dunkirk evacuation, the British War Office put out a call for volunteers to carry out raids along the coasts of the occupied territories and Durnford-Slater was able to convince his commanding officer to recommend him for the special force that was being raised to do this. Shortly afterwards {{he was given a}} brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel and given orders to begin raising and recruiting No. 3 Commando. Although designated No. 3 Commando, No.1 and No. 2 did not exist at the time—the intention being to <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> as airborne units later—and as such Durnford-Slater's unit was the first commando unit raised during the war and Durnford-Slater is considered to be the first British commando of the war.|$|E
25|$|To {{cope with}} the {{shortage}} of qualified teachers, the State Education Commission decreed in 1985 that senior-middle-school teachers should be graduates with two years' training in professional institutes and that primary-school teachers should be graduates of secondary schools. To improve teacher quality, the commission established full-time and part-time (the latter preferred because it was less costly) in-service training programs. Primary-school and preschool in-service teacher training programs devoted 84 {{percent of the time}} to subject teaching, 6 percent to pedagogy and psychology, and 10 percent to teaching methods. In-service training for primary-school teachers was designed to <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> to a level of approximately two years' postsecondary study, with the goal of qualifying most primary-school teachers by 1990. Secondary-school in-service teacher training was based on a unified model, tailored to meet local conditions, and offered on a spare-time basis. Ninety-five percent of its curricula was devoted to subject teaching, 2 to 3 percent to pedagogy and psychology, and 2 to 3 percent to teaching methods. There was no similar large-scale in-service effort for technical and vocational teachers, most of whom worked for enterprises and local authorities.|$|E

In 2016, it was widely reported that the Canada-based Great Enlightenment Buddhist Institute Society (GEBIS) had released [...] of lobsters in the ocean. The release was planned in agreement with local lobster-men. In the same year, Wendy Cook from Lincoln, United States, bought fourteen rabbits from a farm to <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> under better conditions. The costly release, advertised on Facebook as The Great Rabbit Liberation of 2016, was supported by Buddhist monastics from Singapore and the Tibetan tradition, and {{was based on the}} idea of merit-making.|$|E

500|$|A {{major problem}} for the team from the start was that wreck sites in the UK lacked any legal {{protection}} from plunderers and treasure hunters. Sunken ships, once being moving objects, were legally treated as chattel and were awarded to those who could first <b>raise</b> <b>them.</b> The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 also stipulated that any objects raised from a wreck should be auctioned off to finance the salvage operations, {{and there was nothing}} preventing anyone from [...] "stealing" [...] the wreck and making a profit. The problem was handled by forming an organisation, the Mary Rose Committee, aiming [...] "to find, excavate, raise and preserve for all time such remains of the ship Mary Rose as may be of historical or archaeological interest".|$|E
500|$|The first in-game {{year will}} usually consist of kobold thieves and goblin snatchers trying to {{infiltrate}} the fortress. Thieves try to steal valuables while snatchers try to kidnap dwarven children to <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> as future soldiers. Goblin and kobold civilizations near the fortress {{will always be}} hostile {{and a source of}} frequent attacks. Wildlife is usually harmless, but depending on the fortress location, more fierce elephants, bears, unicorns, giant spiders and wolves may be a threat. Wealthier and more populated fortresses will get ambushes and sieges from neighboring goblin (or other enemy) civilization. A thriving fortress will attract certain mega-beasts like hydras, titans or dragons, and randomly generated creatures called [...] "Forgotten Beasts". These unique creatures have randomized physical qualities and abilities, thus making them have the potential to be very powerful. Undead attack mainly in evil biomes or if the player embarks with a Necromancer Tower being near the site. Undead are harder to kill, and often reanimate once they are defeated with their body parts being separate units to fight.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the series, Homer and Lisa's {{relationship}} is problematic, as Homer often struggles to understand Lisa, who {{in many ways}} is a little girl but who is also smarter than him. Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay analyzed [...] "Make Room for Lisa" [...] in their book The Simpsons in the classroom: Embiggening the Learning Experience with the Wisdom of Springfield. They wrote that in the episode, Homer and Lisa's {{relationship is}} badly damaged after Homer allows Lisa's room to {{be turned into a}} cell phone tower. When the two enter sensory-deprivation tanks, Lisa has several hallucinations, including one in which she becomes Homer. This experience shows Lisa how she appears from Homer's point of view, and makes her realize that her treatment of Homer is hurtful, as he often participates in activities with her that he does not enjoy. The episode ends with Homer and Lisa watching a demolition derby, which Lisa enjoys because she is spending time with Homer.
