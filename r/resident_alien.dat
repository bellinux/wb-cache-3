50|$|Non-citizen U.S. {{nationals}} may reside {{and work}} in the United States without restrictions, and may apply for citizenship under the same rules as <b>resident</b> <b>aliens.</b> Like <b>resident</b> <b>aliens,</b> they are not presently allowed by any U.S. state to vote in federal or state elections, although, as with <b>resident</b> <b>aliens,</b> there is no constitutional prohibition against their doing so.|$|R
40|$|<b>Resident</b> <b>aliens</b> in the United States are afforded {{important}} privileges, such as {{residing in}} the United States indefinitely, and seeking employment here. Nevertheless, <b>resident</b> <b>aliens</b> are denied certain job opportunities in states that require United States citizenship as a prerequisite to public employment, or professional or occupational licenses. The Constitutionality of this exclusion has been challenged on equal protection grounds, most recently, by the Supreme Court in Cabell v. Chavez-Salido. In this case, the Court upheld the constitutionality of a California statute, restricting a deputy probation officer position to United States citizens. This case has been hailed as precedent for denying <b>resident</b> <b>aliens</b> equal employment opportunities in the United States. This Note examines the constitutional protections afforded to <b>resident</b> <b>aliens</b> seeking public employments, professional or occupational licenses, as decided by various Supreme Court decisions, and interpreted by lower federal and state courts. In conclusion, the Note recommends how to balance legitimate state goals in denying <b>resident</b> <b>aliens</b> certain employment opportunities, with the <b>resident</b> <b>aliens</b> 2 ̆ 7 rights to such. The author finally recommends that because the purpose of professional licenses is to ensure competence, {{it should not be}} based on alienage, which is not an indicator of such...|$|R

5|$|Casting for {{the episode}} was difficult, as the {{production}} team wanted real Africans. They auditioned every one they could find, including an African theater troupe that was passing by. The role of Marcus Duff eventually went to Carl Lumbly, {{who was known}} for his role on CBS's Cagney & Lacey. The role of Aboah went to Willie Amakye, a Ghanaian Olympic runner who had just returned to his home in Southern California from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. To appear albino, Amakye's skin underwent several layers of cover-up cream, layers of white powder, and a little pink powder for color. He also wore contacts for the transparent pink eyes. Amakye's hair was dyed orange for post-production special effects to change it back and forth from black and white. As revealed on his <b>resident</b> <b>alien</b> card, Aboah's birthday is September 25, a reference to the birthday of Gillian Anderson's daughter.|$|E

After living in the United States for 21 years, Rakoff was motivated by a desire to participate in the political process and applied for U.S. citizenship. Rakoff chronicled the experience of becoming an American citizen in an essay published in Don't Get Too Comfortable.

25|$|To achieve this, the Clinton {{health plan}} {{required}} each US citizen and permanent <b>resident</b> <b>alien</b> to become {{enrolled in a}} qualified health plan {{on his or her}} own or through programs mandated to be offered by businesses with more than 5,000 full-time employees. Subsidies were to be provided to those too poor to afford coverage, including complete subsidies for those below a set income level. Users would choose plans offered by regional health alliances to be established by each state. These alliances would purchase insurance coverage for the state's residents and could set fees for doctors who charge per procedure. The act provided funding to be sent to the states for the administration of the plan, beginning at $14 billion in 1993 and reaching $38 billion in 2003.|$|E

Her application for a faculty position at her alma mater's Medical School was denied on grounds {{that she was a}} still a <b>resident</b> <b>alien,</b> prompting her to apply for Argentine citizenship. Single immigrant women, however, were not generally granted citizenship in Argentina. Lanteri married Dr. Alberto Renshaw in 1910, and following an eight-month-long lawsuit, she was granted citizenship in 1911. The marriage was in itself controversial, as he was 14 years younger than the bride. The same pretext was used to deny her enrollment in the Psychiatry course at her own alma mater's School of Medicine.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments was addressed by Justice Field in Wong Wing v. United States (1896).

A <b>resident,</b> <b>alien</b> born, is entitled to the same protection under the laws that a citizen is entitled to. He owes obedience to the laws of the country in which he is domiciled, and, as a consequence, he is entitled to the equal protection of those laws. ... The contention that persons within the territorial jurisdiction of this republic might be beyond the protection of the law was heard with pain on the argument at the bar—in face of the great constitutional amendment which declares that no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." ...|$|E
