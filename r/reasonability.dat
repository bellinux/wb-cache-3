This Act regulates the use of police weapons and specific technical means of physical force used by police. However, this act does not cover other forms of physical coercion by police officers {{such as the use}} of handcuffs as these are seen as basic police measures that do not require specific legislation. The officer must be legitimately executing his duty and his actions and must be compatible under the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity, <b>reasonability</b> and measure in order to use force. To ensure the Grand Ducal Police do not engage in police brutality numerous safeguards and prevention methods are implemented. The police inspector (which is the term for an everyday officer) must undergo legal and tactical training lasting an intensive 26 months followed by further training at an allocated police station. By way of comparison, the Victoria Police Academy only provides 33 weeks of tactical and legal training. The 2015 Human Right Report on Government practices by the United States indicated no cases of police brutality in Luxembourg. This report suggests the Grand Ducal Police have effective mechanisms in place to investigate and punish potential abuse and corruption.|$|E

50|$|This {{patented}} {{aircraft wing}} design (StratosLiner 2014) comprises backward and forward swept aircraft wing sections in a decagonal box wing configuration, {{as well as}} a pair of middle wings. Both the backward swept front and the forward swept rear wings are divided into root and tip sections, wherein the tip sections of the front wings are more backward swept than the root sections, and the tip sections of the rear wings are more forward swept than the root sections. The middle wing is divided into a backward swept root section and two tip sections, one forward and another backward swept. The four wingtips on each side are interconnected by a wingtip fence, obtaining seven strong and stiff closed frame structures, as well as seven aerodynamic channels for the stream flow. The preferred embodiment has one third smaller wingspan compared to a conventional cantilever aircraft with the same wing area, making it possible to build very large airliners (1000+ passengers) still manageable for our airports.

50|$|Canadian {{philosophers}} in {{the postwar}} era have attempted, {{in a number of}} ways, to resolve these conflicts and to legitimize religious belief. A variety of approaches have been used. Some have stressed the similarities between religion and science, as have F.W. Waters (1967) and Alastair McKinnon (1970). Others, including Lionel Rubinoff, have emphasized the importance of placing our scientific view of the world in a larger human context. There have been attempts to resolve the conflict, through science, as seen in the writings of Charles De Koninck (1960), Thomas Goudge (1961), and A.H. Johnson (1962). Others have attempted to argue the rational nature of religious belief. Some, inspired by St. Thomas Aquinas, include Bernard Lonergan (1952), Louis-Marie Régis (1959), Joseph Owens (1968), Jean-Louis Allard (1979, 1982), and Lawrence Dewan, OP. More general approaches defending the <b>reasonability</b> of religion have been taken by Leslie Armour and William Sweet. Still others have attempted to address issues in the philosophy of religion by questioning underlying issues in metaphysics. Those following this approach within the analytic tradition include Kai Nielsen, Donald Evans (1963), Terence Penelhum (1970), Alistair M. Macleod (1973), and Jay Newman (1986). Phenomenology has also played a role, as seen in the work of Emil Fackenheim (1961), Benoit Pruche (1977-1980), René l'Ecuyer (1980), Jacques Croteau (1981), Cyril Welch (1982), Gary Madison (1988), Hendrik Hart (1990), Jean Grondin (1995), and Thomas De Koninck (1995).|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{distinction}} that is normally drawn between Weil’s practical and his theoretical philosophy, however {{an analysis of}} his practical philosophy also reveals how deeply intertwined the two are. Weil’s practical philosophy {{can be understood as}} expressions of specific philosophical categories, specifically for Weil, moral philosophy is a development of the “the content … of the conscience”. Which, following Kant, tries to articulate the “coexistence of nature and freedom”. [...] In order to show this development, Weil makes {{a distinction}} between formal morality and concrete morality. To start, formal morality is the philosophical analysis and elaboration of the moral criteria of “universality formulated by Kant” [...] as well as its source in the notion of autonomy. This Kantian foundation leads to a development of a reflection on notion of rules, starting from “rule of the universalization of maxims”. This development is a necessary step that is born out of the “loss of certainty” [...] or a loss of confidence in concrete morality. If formal morality is the philosophical reflection that tries to reconcile autonomy, rules and the criteria of universality, concrete morality is the morality of a community that just up until the loss of certainty had claimed to fill that role. In this way there is a constant tension between what is seen as the rules of a community and the ever-developing exigency to universalize the content of moral concepts. Moral action for Weil is born out of the confrontation of different moralities, this recognition forces moral agents to conduct a reflection on the content of their moral system. Starting from this reflection, the agent is confronted with a moral choice that is decided by a criterion of universalizability. Therefore, Weil’s moral theory places an emphasis on how individuals become aware of the criteria of universalizability in order to see themselves as the seat of moral law. This highlights one of the largest distinctions between Weil and Kant, because for Weil, this realization of the moral law, and this self-consciousness of the individual as a moral agent is only ever a possibility. Any individual, in any historic situation can just as well never become aware of their role as a moral agent responsible for the elaboration and practice of a moral content. This difference leads Weil to assert that “the essential task of the moral man is to educate men so that they obey on their own the universal law” [...] Education plays a central role in Weil’s philosophy in general, where the summit of moral and political action is to lead people to reason so that they can become reasonable for themselves. In this way the interplay between coherence, universality and <b>reasonability</b> forms a framework that defines moral action. Thus, an important distinction is the movement from the moral law towards the moral life, whereby notions such as happiness, satisfaction, desire, or duty start to take on a new concrete content, however a content which is now critical, having passed through the filter of the criteria of universalizability. In order to do so, “it is necessary to take a further step and consider morality as a relation to others, {{in the context of a}} concrete morality”. This step, which is the transition from morality, understood as the conscientious action of the individual trying to reconcile a conditioned nature over which the individual has no control and the expressive invention of human freedom, leads directly to Weil’s political thought. For Weil, political action is mediated by this responsibility towards others that translates the criteria of universalizability into a reflection around the notion of justice. This is because justice implies “both equality and legality” [...] and requires the reconciliation of the universal and an actual concrete system of laws that, in a given historical context, can in fact prevent the realization of the universal. Thus the notion of justice demands a critical stance towards the actual legal practices of a given community in order to bring about this reconciliation.|$|E
