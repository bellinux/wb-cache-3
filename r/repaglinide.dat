50|$|Precursor {{drugs to}} <b>repaglinide</b> were invented in late 1983 by {{scientists}} at Dr Karl Thomae GmbH, a German drug manufacturer located at Biberach an der Riß in southern Germany which {{was acquired by}} Boehringer Ingelheim in 1990. The drug that became <b>repaglinide</b> was later licensed by Boehringer to Novo Nordisk, which filed an Investigational New Drug application for the compound with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 1992. Novo Nordisk filed its New Drug Application (NDA) for Prandin in July 1997 and it was quickly approved, gaining FDA approval in December 1997. The drug {{was the first of}} the meglitinide class. It was branded Prandin because its quick onset and short duration of action concentrates its effect around meal time (the prandium was the Roman meal which is comparable to the modern lunch).|$|E
50|$|<b>Repaglinide</b> lowers {{blood glucose}} by {{stimulating}} {{the release of}} insulin from the beta islet cells of the pancreas.

Values over 10 µg/mL indicate glucose on average is below 180 mg/dL. Those with values below 10 µg/mL could benefit from nutritional counseling, and medications which target post meal glucose spikes, such as pramlintide, exenatide, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, <b>repaglinide</b> or rapid acting insulins.|$|E
50|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) {{are another}} class of drugs {{blocking}} catecholamine degradation. Therefore, their combination with opicapone {{can result in}} increased catecholamine concentrations {{in the body and}} corresponding adverse effects. Combining the antiparkinson MAO inhibitors selegiline or rasagiline with opicapone is considered safe. Potentially, there are also interactions with drugs being metabolised by COMT (for example isoprenaline, epinephrine, dopamine, or dobutamine), tricyclic antidepressants and antidepressants of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor type. Possible pharmacokinetic interactions are with substrates of the liver enzyme CYP2C8, such as <b>repaglinide,</b> and the transporter protein SLCO1B1, such as simvastatin.|$|E
50|$|Opicapone sulfate is {{transported by}} SLCO1B1; the {{possibility}} that it blocks this transporter has not been excluded. Opicapone itself and the sulfate are also transported by a number of other proteins, but given the low concentrations of the free substances in the blood plasma, this is very unlikely to give rise to drug interactions. Opicapone is a weak inhibitor of the liver enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9. The only CYP interaction found in studies that is somewhat likely to be relevant is that with <b>repaglinide,</b> which is metabolised by CYP2C8. The metabolism of warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, is not measurably affected.|$|E

50|$|After several {{attempts}} {{to file for}} U.S. patent protection, a filing was made in March 1990 which eventually became U.S. Patents 5,216,167 (June 1993), 5,312,924 (May 1994) and 6,143,769 (November 2000). After filing its NDA for <b>repaglinide</b> in 1997, Novo Nordisk applied for patent extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act.

50|$|The {{degree of}} blood sugar {{elevation}} does not worsen rapidly with age, and long-term diabetic complications are rare. In healthy children and adults, a high blood sugar level {{can be avoided}} by a healthy diet and exercise, primarily avoiding large amounts of carbohydrates. However, as people who have MODY2 enter their 50's and 60's, even though they continue to eat a healthy diet and exercise, they sometimes are unable to control a high blood sugar level with these measures. In these cases, many medicines for type II diabetes mellitus are not effective, because MODY2 does not cause insulin resistance. <b>Repaglinide</b> (Prandin) can help the body regulate the amount of glucose in the blood by stimulating the pancreas to release insulin before meals.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, {{a simple and}} rapid method was {{developed}} to improve the in vitro dissolution of <b>repaglinide,</b> an oral antidiabetic drug, {{which was based on}} addition of meglumine in 50 % (v/v) ethanol to dissolve <b>repaglinide,</b> and the drug dissolved in meglumine/ 50 % ethanol was used directly with a binder to prepare tablets. The mechanism of solubilization of <b>repaglinide</b> by meglumine was studied by using infrared spectrum (IR), ultraviolet (UV) measurement through dual wavelength, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction methods. Dissolution tests of <b>repaglinide</b> tablets were performed in the media with different pH values and the <b>repaglinide</b> concentrations were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method. The solubility data showed that with the meglumine concentration increasing, the solubility of <b>repaglinide</b> was increased. Meanwhile, tablets with the molar ratio of <b>repaglinide</b> and meglumine 1 : 2 (n/n) resulted in a significant increase in dissolution compared to the <b>repaglinide</b> tablets without using meglumine, and nearly equal to the commercial preparations of NovoNorm®, which concluded that meglumine had a great role in promoting the dissolution of <b>repaglinide.</b> The results of IR and UV dual wavelength methods suggested the formation of repaglinide–meglumine (REP–MEG) molecular complex. DSC results showed that the melting peak of <b>repaglinide</b> disappeared in the REP–MEG coprecipitate, which indicated that <b>repaglinide</b> was stable when existing at amorphous or molecular state. The experiment of X-ray powder diffraction showed that with the solubilization of meglumine, the crystal diffraction peak of <b>repaglinide</b> disappeared, which further inferred that <b>repaglinide</b> was formed complexes with meglumine. It was demonstrated that the method of improving <b>repaglinide</b> with meglumine was reliable and could be suitable for <b>repaglinide</b> tablets production in industry. This study also provides a feasible way to enhance the dissolution of drugs with low solubility, which will be leading to improved bioavailability of these drugs...|$|E

40|$|The {{action of}} <b>repaglinide,</b> a novel insulin secretagogue, was {{compared}} with the sulfonylurea glibenclamide {{with regard to the}} hypoglycemic action in vivo, binding to betaTC- 3 cells, insulin secretion from perifused mouse islets, and capacity to stimulate exocytosis by direct interaction with the secretory machinery in single voltage-clamped mouse beta-cells. Two binding sites were identified: a high-affinity <b>repaglinide</b> (KD = 3. 6 nmol/l) site having lower affinity for glibenclamide (14. 4 nmol/l) and one high-affinity glibenclamide (25 nmol/l) site having lower affinity for <b>repaglinide</b> (550 nmol/l). In contrast to glibenclamide, <b>repaglinide</b> (in concentrations as high as 5 micromol/l) lacked the ability to enhance exocytosis in voltage-clamped beta-cells. <b>Repaglinide</b> was more potent than glibenclamide in stimulating insulin release from perifused mouse islets (EC 50 29 vs. 80 nmol/l). The greater potency of <b>repaglinide</b> in vitro was paralleled by similar actions in vivo. The ED 50 values for the hypoglycemic action were determined to be 10. 4 and 15. 6 microg/kg after intravenous and oral administration, respectively. The corresponding values for glibenclamide were 70. 3 microg/kg (intravenous) and 203. 2 microg/kg (oral). Further, <b>repaglinide</b> (1 mg/kg p. o.) was effective (P < 0. 001) as an insulin-releasing agent in a rat model (low-dose streptozotocin) of type 2 diabetes. These observations suggest that the insulinotropic actions of <b>repaglinide</b> and glibenclamide in vitro and in vivo are secondary to their binding to the high-affinity <b>repaglinide</b> site and that the insulinotropic action of <b>repaglinide</b> involves both distinct and common cellular mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Repaglinide</b> is {{actively}} {{taken up by}} OATP 1 B 1 into liver and metabolized by CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 C 8. PBPK modeling was used to predict complex DDIs involving inhibition of both transporter- mediated uptake and metabolism of <b>repaglinide.</b> METHODS: Prior in vitro data on metabolism, protein binding and physicochemical characteristics of <b>repaglinide</b> {{were obtained from the}} literature and incorporated into a PBPK model within the Simcyp Simulator (Version 11). While there are in vivo data to support OATP 1 B 1 - mediated hepatic uptake of <b>repaglinide,</b> in vitro parameters describing this transport were not available to us. Hence, we combined a top-down fitting approach (in vivo concentration-time profile of <b>repaglinide</b> (Niemi et al., 2000)) with bottom-up extrapolation of all prior in vitro data within the Parameter Estimation module of the Simcyp Simulator to obtain an estimate of 282 µl/min/million cells for hepatic uptake clearance of <b>repaglinide</b> via OATP 1 B 1. DDIs involving <b>repaglinide</b> and the inhibitors, cyclosporine (OATP 1 B 1), clarithromycin (CYP 3 A 4) and trimethoprim (CYP 2 C 8) were predicted and compared with observed data. RESULTS: Inclusion of hepatic uptake via OATP 1 B 1 improved the model fit to the in vivo data. However, more importantly, predicted increases in plasma AUC₍ 0 -∞₎ of <b>repaglinide</b> during co-administration of trimethoprim (1. 3 fold; 160 mg qd), clarithromycin (1. 4 fold; 250 mg bid) or cyclosporine (2. 0 fold; 100 mg bid) were consistent with observed values of 1. 6 -, 1. 4 - and 2. 4 -fold. Finally, co-administration of all 3 inhibitors with <b>repaglinide</b> in our virtual clinical trial was associated with a 5. 6 - fold increase in AUC₍ 0 -∞₎.

40|$|OBJECTIVE - To {{examine the}} dose-related {{pharmacodynamics}} and pharmacokinetics {{of a single}} preprandial oral dose of <b>repaglinide</b> in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A total of 16 Caucasian men with type 2 diabetes participated in two placebo-controlled double-blind randomized cross-over studies. Patients were randomized to receive a single oral dose of <b>repaglinide</b> (0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mg in study 1 and 4. 0 mg in study 2) or placebo (both studies) administered 15 min before {{the first of two}} sequential identical standard meals (breakfast and lunch) that were 4 h apart. During each of the study days, which were 1 week apart, blood samples were taken at frequent intervals over a period of similar to 8 h for measurement of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and <b>repaglinide</b> concentrations. RESULTS - During the first meal period (0 - 240 min), administration of <b>repaglinide</b> reduced significantly the area under the curve (AUC) for glucose concentration and significantly increased the AUC for insulin levels, C-peptide levels, and the insulin secretion rate. These results, compared with those of administering placebo, were dose dependent and log linear. The effect of <b>repaglinide</b> administration on insulin secretion was most pronounced in the early prandial period. Within 30 min, it caused a relative increase in insulin secretion of up to 150. During the second meal period (240 - 480 min), {{there was no difference between}} <b>repaglinide</b> and placebo administration in the AUC for glucose concentration, C-peptide concentration, and the estimated insulin secretion rate. CONCLUSIONS - A single dose of <b>repaglinide</b> (0. 5 - 4. 0 mg) before breakfast improves insulin secretion and reduces prandial hyperglycemia dose-dependently. Administration of <b>repaglinide</b> had no effect on insulin secretion with the second meal, which was consumed 4 h after breakfast...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{more rapid}} {{onset of action}} and the shorter {{half-life}} of <b>repaglinide</b> may reduce the post-load glucose excursion and limit sustained insulin secretion compared to sulphonylurea (SU) derivatives. METHODS: We studied 12 patients with type 2 diabetes (age 62 +/- 2 years, BMI 28. 3 +/- 1. 3 kg m(- 2), HbA 1 c 6. 7 +/- 0. 2 %) on SU monotherapy at submaximal dose. Patients were treated for 3 weeks with <b>repaglinide</b> or glibenclamide in a randomized, crossover trial. At {{the end of each}} treatment period, patients underwent a 60 -min hyperglycaemic clamp (glucose 12 mmol L(- 1)) followed by 4 -h observation (60 - 300 min) with frequent blood sampling for determination of glucose, insulin, proinsulin and C-peptide levels. Before the clamp (5 min for <b>repaglinide,</b> 30 min for glibenclamide), patients ingested their usual morning drug dose. RESULTS: After the end of the hyperglycaemic clamp, mean plasma glucose fell to a level of 5 mmol L(- 1) after approximately 150 min with <b>repaglinide,</b> and after approximately 190 min with glibenclamide. While initially quite similar, in the period from 240 to 300 min, insulin, proinsulin and C-peptide levels were lower during <b>repaglinide</b> treatment (insulin 133 +/- 20 vs 153 +/- 25 pmol L(- 1) (P < 0. 05), proinsulin 14 +/- 3 vs 19 +/- 4 pmol L(- 1) (P = 0. 06) and C-peptide 0. 81 +/- 0. 19 vs 1. 14 +/- 0. 18 nmol L(- 1) (P = 0. 05) for <b>repaglinide</b> vs glibenclamide, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Following glucose stimulation, plasma glucose levels, and insulin concentration decrease more rapidly after <b>repaglinide</b> treatment than after glibenclamide. Proinsulin and C-peptide secretion tended to fall more rapidly as well. These findings are consistent with a more rapid onset and shorter duration of beta-cell stimulation associated with <b>repaglinide...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of sex differences on the pharmacokinetics of <b>repaglinide</b> in healthy subjects. One hundred twenty one healthy volunteers (61 male and 60 female; aged 18 - 50 years) were included in the study. Subjects were administered a single 4 -mg <b>repaglinide</b> oral dose. Blood samples were taken at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min. Serum <b>repaglinide</b> levels were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Subjects were also genotyped by polymerase chain reactions - restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) for CYP 3 A 4 * 4, * 5 and * 18 alleles and by an allele-specific multiplex PCR for CYP 2 C 8 * 2, * 3, * 4 and * 5 alleles. The pharmacokinetics of <b>repaglinide</b> were comparable between male and female subjects. The mean clearance (CL) of <b>repaglinide</b> was 16. 0 % lower (p = 0. 03), the mean area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) was 12. 8 % higher (p = 0. 04) and the peak serum concentration (Cmax) was 13. 2 % higher (p = 0. 03) in females compared to male subjects. The mean rate of elimination (kel) and mean CL of <b>repaglinide</b> were 47. 67 % (p = 0. 03) higher and 29. 25 % (p = 0. 03) higher, respectively, in male subjects having CYP 2 C 8 * 5 allele compared to female subjects. We also found that the mean half-life (t 1 / 2 ) of <b>repaglinide</b> was 42. 43 % higher (p = 0. 03), and the mean AUC was 35. 83 % higher (p = 0. 03) in female subjects when compared to the male subjects having CYP 2 C 8 * 5 allele. Sex differences significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of <b>repaglinide...</b>|$|E
