40|$|South Africa's small {{pelagics}} fishery {{is currently the}} largest in volume and second largest in value in the southern Benguela. It exploits short-lived, small pelagic fishes such as anchovy (for reduction into fish meal and oil) and sardine (for reduction as well as human consumption through canned products), {{and to a lesser}} extent <b>redeye</b> <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> and mesopelagics, largely for reduction. We explore the recent history (1940 s to present) of the social-ecological system around this fishery. The natural subsystem, at the scales of the ocean environment and the ecosystem, is characterized by high interannual and documented decadal-scale variability. We characterize the human social subsystem at the scales of the fishing industry, legislation, and west coast fishing towns, and demonstrate interdependencies between the natural and social subsystems by following system-scale changes. The pelagic fishing industry has evolved to deal with variability through consolidation, diversification, and range expansion. Legislation has increasingly looked for conservation of the resource while ensuring economic viability of the industry, and hence factory- and vessel-related jobs. Fishing communities under apartheid stayed largely dependent on company-generated infrastructure, combining seasonal employment in the fishing factories with inshore fishing, targeting rock lobster and line fish. While the pelagic industry persisted and communities survived, the resource base for both offshore and inshore fisheries gradually eroded. The advent of democracy in the mid- 1990 s brought allocation of long-term fishing rights to individuals or companies under conditions of depleted inshore resources aggravated by a shift in the distribution of pelagic fish away from the west coast towards the Cape south coast in the second half of the 1990 s. The resultant loss of employment and fishing rights in the inshore has generated community coping strategies that include poaching and challenges to the current Marine Living Resources Act, while the industry continues to expand by range and species, possibly further eroding the resource base. We argue that the situation in the pelagic social-ecological system is indicative of further loss of resilience to change. Coping with future long-term, system-scale change will necessitate careful long-term scenario planning among the various interest groups involved, joint research being one way to overcome the communications breakdown and initiate the joint planning process...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-two {{specimens}} of the sixgill sawshark, Pliotrema warreni, were trawled near Bird Island in Algoa Bay on the Eastern coast of South Africa in April and May 2015. The specimens were examined for anatomical proportions, reproductive characteristics, diet, and parasite assemblages. Several external measurements were collected including mass, total length, standard length, girth, rostrum length, interoccular to pre-caudal length, first dorsal origin to second dorsal origin, first dorsal origin to pre-caudal origin, and mouth width. The equation for mass (g) vs. total length (mm) was ln(Mass) = 0. 2997 *ln(TL) + 2. 0383 for females and ln(Mass) = 0. 3321 *ln(TL) + 1. 941 for males. 1 st Dorsal to 2 nd dorsal origin length (DD) to total length equations for {{females and males}} were DD= 0. 2451 *TL- 26. 677 and DD= 0. 2598 *TL- 34. 535, respectively. Mean lengths and masses were 11. 5 % greater and 50. 3 % heavier in females than males, respectively. Females were on average, 994 mm (759 mm – 1283 mm) in length while males were 891. 8 mm (763 mm – 1015 mm). Average mass for females was 1702. 5 g (602. 5 g – 3478. 5 g) whereas males it was 1132. 6 g (687 g – 1593. 5 g). Based on these data both sexes display isometric growth. Males were determined to reach sexually maturity around 850 mm {{which is similar to}} that reported by Ebert et al., (2013) around 830 mm. Females were found to reach sexual maturity at 1000 mm which is 100 mm smaller than what is reported by Ebert et al., (2013). Stomach mass increased with total mass and total length regardless of sex (female R² = 0. 507; male R² = 0. 213 for length and female R² = 0. 6123; male R² = 0996 for mass). Females consumed larger prey items in terms of mass and length as well as a higher quantity of prey than males presumably because they are the larger sex and have an increased need for nourishment to provide for pregnancy. Prey items were <b>redeye</b> <b>round</b> <b>herring,</b> Etrumeus whiteheadi (64. 96 % of the diet), a benthic shrimp species not identified (7. 69 %), and Cape horse mackerel, Trachurus trachurus capensis (0. 85 %). Despite strict adherence to the guidelines for age determination for elasmobranchs provided in the literature, the conventional method used which involved extensive cleaning of the vertebral centra with an array of chemicals, setting and cutting in an epoxy resin, and staining for microscopy, did not yield readable results which could be used to determine the ages of these sharks. The highest abundance of parasites were found in the stomachs. Three {{specimens of}} a cymothoid isopod was found externally. Two specimens of Ascaris sp. nematode were found in the visceral cavity. The remaining 18 parasites consisted of three Neoechinorhynchidae sp. of acanthocephalan and 15 Proleptus obtusus nematodes all of which were found inside the stomachs. Given the results of the parasite survey, males and females {{do not have the same}} parasites as females have four different species while males only have one. More collections from other areas and times of year are necessary to obtain a better description of the species...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 122 - 159. Three fish species, anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, sardine Sardinops sagax and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> Etrumeus whiteheadi, co-exist {{over the}} western Agulhas Bank (W AB) in the {{southern}} Benguela upwelling ecosystem. To date, data on high-resolution distributions in ichthyoplankton {{in the region is}} lacking. To address this need, coarse and high-resolution ichthyoplankton data were collected using a California vertical egg tow (CalVET) net and a continuous, underway fish egg sampler (CUFES) for horizontal data, respectively, and plankton pump and a closing WP II net for vertical data. Simultaneous measurements of temperature were recorded during the CalVET net hauls. Eggs from vertically stratified samples were grouped into three categories based on their developmental stage using established protocols. Volumetric estimates of egg density (eggs. m- 3) from on-station CUFES samples were significantly correlated with normalized areal (eggs. m- 2) estimates of egg density from CalVET net samples at these stations for sardine (r 0. 91), <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> (r= 0. 80) and anchovy (r = 0. 73), demonstrating the validity of the CUFES sampling technique. Underway sample collection reduced the survey coefficient of variation for sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> eggs but not for anchovy eggs. Horizontal egg distribution patterns for anchovy showed that high egg densities were centered at two specific regions: midshelf (east of Cape Point) and offshore {{in the southern}} region of the study area, whereas those of sardines and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> were more continuously distributed above and beyond the 200 m isobath. Egg abundances for all species generally increased from inshore towards offshore. The mean egg densities for all three species were found to be spatially associated, whereas the station by station distribution patterns of anchovy eggs were spatially distinct from sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring.</b> Eggs of all three species were concentrated near the surface (0 - 20 m), although proportions varied among species. All developmental stages of anchovy egg were confined close to the surface indicating that this species spawns near the surface. Sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> vertical egg profiles varied ontogenetically, even though all developmental stages were concentrated near the surface. A significant (> 50 %) proportion of early egg stages were widely distributed between 0 - 60 and 0 - 80 m for sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring,</b> respectively. These results therefore show that the spawning depths of these three c 1 upeiforms overlap to a large extent, but the intensity of spawning varied at depth for each species. In general the vertical thermal structure seemed to affect only how deeply the eggs are distributed rather than the mean egg abundance. The differences in vertical egg profiles among and within (with respect to ontogenetic variation) species were found to be statistically significant (Chi-squared test, P < 0. 05). Investigations of spawning patterns in relation to temperature, longitude and latitude were used to compare the spawning habitats of the three species. Quotient rule analysis was used to distinguish the preferred temperature ranges of all three species. <b>Round</b> <b>herring</b> spawn over a wider temperature range (16. 5 - 18. 1 °C) than anchovy (17. 4 - 17. 8 ° C and sardine (17 - 18. 1 °C). Two spawning peaks were apparent for <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> (main peak at 17. 2 °C and secondary peak at 17. 8 °C), whereas only one peak at 18. 0 °C was apparent for anchovy and sardine. Anchovy spawning showed a domed-shape relationship with geographic location and the relationship was viewed to be more informative (r 2 = 0. 13 longitude, ~ = 0. 11 latitude) compared to sardine (r 2 = 0. 08 longitude, r 2 = 0. 07 latitude) and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> (r 2 = 0. 04 longitude, r 2 = 0. 06 latitude). These results indicate that anchovy were more specific in their selection of spawning habitat than sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring.</b> Generally, these results suggest that the overall spawning habitats of anchovy, sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> on the W AB overlap to a large extent, but their exact locations of the point of spawning are spatially distinct...|$|R

40|$|Fishes of the {{subfamily}} Dussumieriinae, {{also known}} as <b>round</b> <b>herrings,</b> are a small subgroup of the family Clupeidae inhabiting tropical and subtropical marine coastal waters. A new genus and species of <b>round</b> <b>herring,</b> Trollichthys bol-censis gen. et sp. nov., is described from the lower Eocene micritic limestone of Monte Bolca, northern Italy. This new clupeid taxon is based on seven partially complete articulated skeletons that exhibit a unique combination of features, including: two supramaxillae, edentulous jaw and palate bones, 41 – 42 preural vertebrae and 22 – 24 pleural ribs, pleural ribs-preural vertebrae ratio ranging 0. 52 – 0. 57, five or six supraneural bones, dorsal-fin origin located at about mid-length of the body, dorsal fin with about 16 rays, two postcleithra, pelvic-fin insertion slightly behind the dorsal-fin origin, and pelvic fin with eight rays. Trollichthys bolcensis shares several features with the extant <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> genus Spratelloi-des.

40|$|An initial {{assessment}} of the South African Round Herring (Etrumeus whiteheadi) resource, {{commonly referred to as}} Red Eye, has been undertaken. Considering the proportion of females in different reproductive stages, Roel and Melo (1990) report that, although older <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> appear to be reproductively active throughout the year, the smaller, more abundant fish are reproductively active for just a short period in the winter, with a peak in June. Their histological analysis indicated peak spawning in May, July, August and November, with no data available for April, June, September or October. The abundance of <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> eggs and larvae per station from the CELP program (August 1977 - August 1978) indicates a very low level of spawning between January and April, with a peak in egg numbers in August and a peak in larvae in October (van der Westhuizen pers. comm.). Taking this into consideration, together with the timing of the recruit survey, the <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> will be modelled to have an annual birth date of 1 June.

40|$|Molecular genetic {{surveys of}} marine fishes have {{revealed}} that some widely distributed species are actually a composite of multiple evolutionary lineages. This is apparent in the <b>round</b> <b>herrings</b> (genus Etrumeus), wherein a globally distributed taxon (Etrumeus sadina Mitchill 1814) has proven to contain at least seven valid taxa, with more likely awaiting discovery. Here, we survey evolutionary lineages of the nominal E. sadina (formerly E. teres, a junior synonym) across the southern temperate zone of Australia, a marine region divided into three biogeographic provinces based primarily {{on the distribution of}} intertidal faunas. Results from morphological and mitochondrial DNA data reveal two evolutionary lineages corresponding to eastern and southwestern provinces (d = 0. 007 for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and d = 0. 017 for cytochrome b), possibly initiated by the Bassian Isthmus between Australia and Tasmania during low sea-level stands. The Australian <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> is also genetically distinct from the nearest congeneric forms in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with a corresponding modal difference in gill-raker counts in most cases. Based on these data, we resurrect the title Etrumeus jacksoniensis for the Australian <b>round</b> <b>herring.</b> While the Bassian Isthmus may have initiated the partition of evolutionary lineages within Australia, additional oceanographic and ecological factors must reinforce this separation in order to maintain diagnostic genetic differences along a continuous temperate coastline. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
