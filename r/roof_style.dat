25|$|Several Acehnese architects have {{attempted}} to modernize the traditional architecture of Aceh. One attempt is to replicate the roof canopy of the Cakra Donya bell (an ancient relic in Aceh) into the auditorium of the State Museum of Aceh. This reinterpretation of the Cakra Donya roof was completed by Wim Sutrisno, a local architect. The Cakra Donya <b>roof</b> <b>style</b> has become popular in Aceh {{and can be found}} decorating the gates to hotels or bus shelter roofs. The gable roof has also been reinterpreted in many buildings, often with double gable screens, complete with a protruding wooden screen.|$|E
25|$|The Fehr Round Barn {{illustrates}} {{the evolution of}} round barn design, especially in the Stephenson County area. The barn {{was the first in}} the area to be built with a hip roof. This <b>roof</b> <b>style</b> set the structure's design apart from the typical round barn designed based on recommendations from the University of Illinois' and the University of Wisconsin–Madison's Agricultural Experiment Stations. The building represents the ability of local builders and designers to create their own ideas without the station's influence. The Fehr Round Barn was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1984 as part of a Multiple Property Submission.|$|E
25|$|On 6 February 1889 the Bangu Textile Factory was founded, {{with the}} name of Industrial Progress Company of Brazil (Companhia Progresso Industrial do Brasil). The factory was officially opened on 8 March 1893, in a very {{beautiful}} architectural complex with styles like Italianate, Neo-Gothic and a tower in Mansard <b>Roof</b> <b>style.</b> After the opening in 1893, workers from Great Britain arrived in Bangu to work in the textile factory. The old farms became worker villages with red bricks houses, and a neo-gothic church was created, which still exists as the Saint Sebastian and Saint Cecilia Parish Church. Street cinemas and cultural buildings also appeared.|$|E

50|$|The <b>roofing</b> <b>style</b> of Bengali Hindu temple {{architecture}} {{is unique and}} {{closely related to the}} paddy <b>roofed</b> traditional building <b>style</b> of rural Bengal. <b>Roofing</b> <b>styles</b> include the ek-bangla, jor-bangla, do-chala, char-chala, at-chala, deul, ek-ratna, pancharatna and navaratna. Bishnupur in West Bengal has a remarkable set of such temples which being built from the Malla dynasty are examples of this style. Most of these temples are covered on the outer surface with terra cotta reliefs which contains plenty of secular materials making these important to reconstruct the social structure from these times.|$|R

25|$|Bandung {{is home to}} {{numerous}} examples of Dutch colonial architecture; most notably the tropical Art Deco, dubbed New Indies Style. Henri Maclaine-Pont {{was among the first}} Dutch architects to recognise the importance of combining each architectural style with local cultural traditions. He stressed that modern architecture should interact with local history and native elements. In 1920, Pont planned and designed buildings for the first technical university in the Dutch East Indies, Technische Hogeschool te Bandung (the present-day Institut Teknologi Bandung), after which he was named as a Professor of Architecture at the university. A striking local Sundanese <b>roof</b> <b>style</b> is clearly seen adorning the top of the campus' ceremonial hall, and is embedded in his artwork.|$|E
25|$|The Bruce Round Barn is {{the last}} known round barn {{constructed}} by the team of Shaffer and the Haas Brothers. The design of the Bruce Barn {{is important in the}} evolution of general round barn design. The single hip roof construction, complete with a series of internal rafter braces for extra support are the result of the inability of some carpenters to complete the self-supporting roofs that round barns typically utilized. The Haas Brothers and Shaffer came up with two novel solutions to this problem. The first was to construct a conical roof, the second, which is exemplified in the Bruce Round Barn, was to construct a single hip roof. The University of Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station heavily influenced the <b>roof</b> <b>style.</b>|$|E

The rear window was recessed between the C pillars, making back area look similar to that of the General Motors' 1966-1967 [...] "A" [...] body platform two-door models, such as the Chevrolet Chevelle and Pontiac GTO. The swept-back panels and roof were covered in black vinyl to enhance the car's deep red metallic body finish.|$|E

2500|$|The first temple {{built in}} the six-spire sloped <b>roof</b> <b>style</b> was the Boise Idaho Temple, the design of which started after its {{announcement}} on March 31, 1982. Early examples of this design proved inadequate: Boise, Dallas, and Chicago were closed for extensive renovations not long after opening. These renovations restructured rooms, added facilities, and made other enhancements that significantly improved the buildings. The last temple built in this style was the Las Vegas Nevada Temple, which was completed in 1989. This style was then largely replaced by the classic modern, single-spire design. The unifying concept behind this style was the six spires and the sloped roof. Other than those factors, the temples varied widely in size and capacity, as illustrated in the table below: ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1986 Fiero {{arrived on}} 12 September 1986, however, the GT model was not listed. The {{previous}} year's GT became the 1986 SE. The 1986 GT was delayed until 3 January 1987. This {{was the first}} time the fastback roofline was offered, sometimes referred to as a [...] "1986½" [...] model, as the new fastback body restyle was not yet ready for release at the start of the model year. Though originally conceived by Pontiac insiders as a new model, possibly called the [...] "GTP" [...] or [...] "GTU," [...] it has been said that GM management at the time felt that using [...] "GTP" [...] or [...] "GTU" [...] suggested a racing car and thus an image they did not want to promote. Individuals present at the unveiling of the new fastback <b>roof</b> <b>style,</b> in February 1984, at GM's Arizona test track, actually thought it was a new Corvette at first. The Muncie/Getrag 5-speed transaxle, which did not arrive until June 1986, became the standard transaxle in V6 models. Models equipped with the four-cylinder engine remained largely unchanged. Red and Light Gray Metallic were dropped as colors with Light Gold Metallic (M56), Silver Metallic (M16) and Bright Red (M81) being added. The clutch hydraulic systems were redesigned with new master and slave cylinders.|$|E
