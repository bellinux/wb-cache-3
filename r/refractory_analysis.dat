Until now, however, copy number mutations (CNMs) involving the CFTR gene have not been methodically analyzed, resulting almost certainly in the under-ascertainment of CFTR gene duplications as compared with deletions. Here, high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (averaging one interrogating probe every 95 bp) was used to analyze {{the entire length of the}} CFTR gene (189 kb) in 233 cystic fibrosis chromosomes lacking conventional mutations. We succeeded in identifying five duplication CNMs which would otherwise have been <b>refractory</b> to <b>analysis.</b> Based upon findings from this and other studies, we propose that deletion and duplication CNMs in the human autosomal genome are likely to be generated in the proportion of approximately 2 - 3 : 1.

Approximately 1000 stable transformants were screened individually {{for the production of}} elevated frequencies of aneuploid spore colonies. Twenty-two candidates were subjected to a secondary screen for cytological defects. Five mutants exhibited significant levels of aberrant meiotic chromosome segregation, but were proficient for mating and completion of meiosis.

The mutations were recessive and defined five complementation groups, revealing five distinct genes (scm 1, scm 2, scm 3, scm 4 and scm 5).

Although a range of chemical antifouling monolayers has been developed to address this problem, many macromolecular interactions still remain <b>refractory</b> to <b>analysis</b> due to the prevalent high degree of non-specific binding. We describe how we use the dynamic process {{of the formation of}} self assembling monolayers and optimise physical and chemical properties thus reducing considerably non-specific binding and allowing analysis of specific binding of analytes to immobilized target molecules. Methodology/Principal Findings: We illustrate this approach by the production of specific protein arrays for the analysis of interactions between the 65 kDa isoform of human glutamate decarboxylase (GAD 65) and a human monoclonal antibody. Our data illustrate that we have effectively eliminated non-specific interactions with the surface containing the immobilised GAD 65 molecules. The findings have several implications. First, this approach obviates the dubious process of background subtraction and gives access to more accurate kinetic and equilibrium values that are no longer contaminated by multiphase non-specific binding. Second, an enhanced signal to noise ratio increases not only the sensitivity but also confidence in the use of SPR to generate kinetic constants that may then be inserted into van’t Hoff type analyses to provide comparative DG, DS and DH values, making this an efficient, rapid and competitive alternative to ITC measurement...|$|R

However, a significant bias has generally militated against the detection of these pathological events at autosomal loci. Based upon this and other observations, we surmised that some previously unresolved cystic fibrosis chromosomes might carry hitherto undetected L 1 -mediated retrotranspositional insertions at the CFTR locus. This study represents an attempt to identify such mutational events. Methods 100 previously unresolved cystic fibrosis chromosomes were carefully reanalyzed using quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography (QHPLC).

Each compartment has a unique complement of proteins, the proteome. Determining the proteome of the envelope is essential for developing an in silico bacterial model, for determining cellular responses to environmental alterations, for determining the function of proteins encoded by genes of unknown function and for development and testing of new experimental technologies such as mass spectrometric methods for identifying and quantifying hydrophobic proteins. The availability of complete genomic information has led several groups to develop computer algorithms to predict the proteome of {{each part of the}} envelope by searching the genome for leader sequences, β-sheet motifs and stretches of α-helical hydrophobic amino acids. In addition, published experimental data has been mined directly and by machine learning approaches. In this review we examine the somewhat confusing available literature and relate published experimental data to the most recent gene annotation of E. coli to describe the predicted and experimental proteome of each compartment. The problem of characterizing integral versus membrane-associated proteins is discussed. The E. coli envelope proteome provides an excellent test bed for developing mass spectrometric techniques for identifying hydrophobic proteins that have generally been <b>refractory</b> to <b>analysis.</b> We describe the gel based and solution based proteome analysis approaches along with protein cleavage and proteolysis methods that investigators are taking to tackle this difficult problem...|$|R

Genome sequences of uncultivable secondary symbionts have been <b>refractory</b> to <b>analysis</b> {{due to the}} difficulties of isolating adequate DNA samples. By amplifying DNA from hemolymph of infected pea aphids, we obtained a set of genomic sequences of H. defensa and an associated bacteriophage. H. defensa harbors two type III secretion systems, related to those that mediate host cell entry by enteric pathogens. The phage, called APSE- 2, is a close relative of the previously sequenced APSE- 1 but contains intact homologs of the gene encoding cytolethal distending toxin (cdtB), which interrupts the eukaryotic cell cycle and which is known {{from a variety of}} mammalian pathogens. The cdtB homolog is highly expressed, and its genomic position corresponds to that of a homolog of stx (encoding Shiga-toxin) within APSE- 1. APSE- 2 genomes were consistently abundant in infected pea aphids, and related phages were found in all tested isolates of H. defensa, from numerous insect species. Based on their ubiquity and abundance, these phages appear to be an obligate component of the H. defensa life cycle.

The fibrils are indeterminate in size, heteropolymeric, and highly cross-linked, which make them <b>refractory</b> to <b>analysis</b> by conventional high-resolution structure determination techniques. Electron microscopy has been limited to making simple measurements of fibril diameter and immunolocalizing certain molecules at the fibril surface. Consequently, structural information on the fibrils is limited. In this study we have used scanning transmission electron microscopic mass mapping, analysis of axial stain exclusion pattern, and r-weighted back-projection techniques to determine the intermediate resolution (to ≈ 4 nm) structure of thin collagen fibrils from embryonic cartilage. The analyses show that the fibrils are constructed from a 10 + 4 microfibrillar arrangement in which a core of four microfibrils {{is surrounded by a}} ring of 10 microfibrils. Accurate mass measurements predict that each microfibril contains five collagen molecules in cross-section. Based on the proportion of collagen II, IX, and XI in the fibrils, the fibril core comprises two microfibrils each of collagen II and collagen XI. Single molecules of collagen IX presumably occur at the fibril surface between the extended N-terminal domains of collagen XI. The 10 + 4 microfibril structure explains the mechanism of diameter limitation in the narrow fibrils and the absence of narrow collagen fibrils in cartilage lacking collagen XI...|$|R

However, region-specific disease-associated copy number changes have also been observed which exhibit non-recurrent breakpoints. The mechanisms underlying these non-recurrent copy number changes {{have not yet been}} fully elucidated. Results: We analyze large NF 1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints as a model to investigate the full spectrum of causative mechanisms, and observe that they are mediated by various DNA double strand break repair mechanisms, as well as aberrant replication. Further, two of the 17 NF 1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints, identified in unrelated patients, occur in association with the concomitant insertion of SINE/variable number of tandem repeats/Alu (SVA) retrotransposons at the deletion breakpoints. The respective breakpoints are <b>refractory</b> to <b>analysis</b> by standard breakpoint-spanning PCRs and are only identified by means of optimized PCR protocols designed to amplify across GC-rich sequences. The SVA elements are integrated within SUZ 12 P intron 8 in both patients, and were mediated by target-primed reverse transcription of SVA mRNA intermediates derived from retrotranspositionally active source elements. Both SVA insertions occurred during early postzygotic development and are uniquely associated with large deletions of 1 Mb and 867 kb, respectively, at the insertion sites. Conclusions: Since active SVA elements are abundant in the human genome and the retrotranspositional activity of many SVA source elements is high, SVA insertion-associated large genomic deletions encompassing many hundreds of kilobases could constitute a novel and as yet under-appreciated mechanism underlying large-scale copy number changes in the human genome...|$|R

In order to understand this important process, the trans-acting factors that enforce the choice of particular splicing pathways in different environments must be identified.

Exon 3 of alpha-tropomyosin is specifically inhibited in smooth muscle cells allowing the alternative inclusion of exon 2. We have used a novel gene transfer and selection strategy to detect a gene whose expression in fibroblasts is sufficient to switch them to smooth muscle-specific splicing of alpha-tropomyosin and also alpha-actinin. Extracts from the regulating fibroblasts contain an apparently novel 55 kDa protein which binds to RNA elements required for regulation of tropomyosin splicing.

Hence, it is worthy of developing a simple and rapid nucleotide-based assay for differentiation of wild-type CDV which is a cause of disease from attenuated CDVs after vaccination. High frequency variations {{have been found in}} the region spanning from the 3 '-untranslated region (UTR) of the matrix (M) gene to the fusion (F) gene (designated M-F UTR) in a few CDV strains. To establish a differential diagnosis assay, an amplification <b>refractory</b> mutation <b>analysis</b> was established based on the highly variable region on M-F UTR and F regions.

Mixtures with additions up to 50 % residue and the clay commonly used in forming ceramic tiles were analyzed by the method of Casagrande apparatus (ASTM D 4318) to obtain the fluid and plastic limits, and the plasticity index of each. According to the analysis, it can be established that the plasticity of the mixtures is greatly influenced by the wastes addition, being the steel slag and post-mortem aluminosilicate refractories, those which most lowered the index, affecting negatively the extrusion forming of the products...|$|R
40|$|Refractory {{coatings}} {{based on}} different refractory fillers (talc, cordierite, zircon and mullite) for application in Lost Foam casting process were investigated. Design and optimization of the coatings composition with controlled, rheological properties included, and consequently synthesis were achieved by application of different coating components, namely different suspension agents and fillers and by alteration of the coating production procedure. Morphologic and microstructural analysis of fillers {{was carried out}} by means of scanning electronic microscope. X-ray diffraction analysis by means of X-ray diffractometer was applied in determination and monitoring the phase composition changes of the <b>refractory</b> fillers. An <b>analysis</b> of the particle size and shape {{was carried out by}} means of the PC software application package OZARIA 2. 5. To assess the effects of application of individual refractory coatings, a detailed investigation of structural and mechanical properties of the moldings obtained was performed. Highlight was placed on revealing and analyzing surface and volume defects present on moldings. Radiographic molding tests were carried out by means of the X-ray device SAIFORT type-S 200. Attained results are essential for the synthesis of refractory coatings based on high-temperature fillers and their applications in Lost Foam casting proces...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Probe and primer {{design for}} single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) detection can be very challenging for A-T DNA-rich targets, requiring long sequences with lower specificity and stability, while G-C-rich DNA targets present limited design options to lower GC-content sequences only. We have developed the MGB Eclipsee™ Probe System, which is composed of the following elements: MGB Eclipse probes and primers, specially developed software {{for the design of}} probes and primers, a unique set of modified bases and a Microsoft Excel macro for automated genotyping, which ably solves, in large part, this challenge. Fluorogenic MGB Eclipse probes are modified oligo-nucleotides containing covalently attached duplex-stabilising dihydrocyclopyrroloindole tripeptide (DPI 3), the MGB ligand (MGB™ is a trademark of Epoch Biosciences, Bothell, WA), which has the combined properties of allowing the use of short sequences and providing great mismatch discrimination. The MGB moiety prevents probe degradation during polymerase chain reaction (PCR), allowing the researcher to use real time data; alternatively, hybridisation can be accurately measured by a post-PCR two-colour melt curve analysis. Using MGB Eclipse probes and primers containing modified bases further enhances the analysis of difficult SNP targets. G- or C-rich sequences can be <b>refractory</b> to <b>analysis</b> due to Hoogsteen base pairing. Substitution of normal G with Epoch's modified G prevents Hoogsteen base pairing, allowing both superior PCR and probe-based analysis of GC-rich targets. The use of modified A and T bases allows better stabilisation by significantly increasing the T m of the oligonucleotides. Modified A creates A-T base pairs that have a stability slightly lower than a G-C base pair, and modified T creates T-A base pairs that have a stability about 30 per cent higher than the unmodified base pair. Together, the modified bases permit the use of short probes, providing good mismatch discrimination and primers that allow PCR of refractory targets. The combination of MGB Eclipse probes and primers enriched with the MGB ligand and modified bases has allowed the <b>analysis</b> of <b>refractory</b> SNPs, where other methods have failed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is an {{amenable}} {{model to}} study the molecular and biochemical events that lead to morphological transition in fungi, because temperature {{seems to be the}} only factor regulating this process. It is the causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, a systemic mycosis that affects humans and that is geographically conned to Latin America, where it constitutes one of the most prevalent deep mycoses. With the help of molecular tools, events leading to the morphological transition have been traced to genes that control cell wall glucan and chitin syntheses, and other metabolic processes such as production of heat shock proteins and ornithine decarboxylase activity. Molecular diagnosis and epidemiology of paracoccidioidomycosis are also the focus of intensive research, with several primers being proposed as specic probes for clinical and eld uses. Although P. brasiliensis is <b>refractory</b> to cytogenetic <b>analysis,</b> electrophoretic methods have allowed an approximation of its genomic organization and ploidy. Finally, the recognition of P. brasiliensis as an anamorph in the phylum Ascomycota, order Onygenales, family Onygenaceae, has been accomplished by means of molecular tools. This phylogenetic placement has revised the taxonomic position of this fungus, which was traditionally included within now-abandoned higher anamorph taxa, the phylum Deuteromycota and the class Hyphomycetes...|$|R
40|$|Sodalis glossinidius, one of {{the three}} tsetse fly maternally {{inherited}} symbionts, was previously shown to favor fly infection by trypanosomes, the parasites causing human sleeping sickness. Among a population of flies taking a trypanosome-infected blood meal, only a few individuals will acquire the parasite; the others will escape infection and be considered as refractory to trypanosome infection. The aim of the work was to investigate whether fly refractoriness could be associated with specific Sodalis gene expression. The transcriptome of S. glossinidius harbored by flies that were fed either with a noninfected blood meal (control) or with a trypanosome-infected meal but that did not develop infection were analyzed, using microarray technology, and compared. The analysis using the microarray procedure yielded 17 genes that were found to have a significant differential expression between the two groups. Interestingly, all these genes were overexpressed in self-cured (<b>refractory)</b> flies. Further <b>analysis</b> of functional annotation of these genes indicated that most associated biological process terms were related to metabolic and biosynthetic processes as well as to oxido-reduction mechanisms. These results evidence the occurrence of molecular crosstalk between the different partners, induced by the passage of the trypanosomes through the fly’s gut even though the parasites were unable to establish in the gut and to develop a permanent infection...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: HIV- 1 reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) {{is a major}} target {{for the treatment of}} acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Resistance mutations in RT compromise treatment, however. Efforts to understand the enzymatic mechanism of RT and the basis for mutational resistance to anti-RT drugs have been hampered by the failure to crystallize a catalytically informative RT–substrate complex. Results: We present here experiments that allow us to understand the reason for the failure to crystallize such a complex. Based on this understanding, we have devised a new approach for using a combinatorial disulfide cross-linking strategy to trap a catalytic RT·template:primer·dNTP ternary complex, thereby enabling the growth of co-crystals suitable for high-resolution structural analysis. The crystals contain a fully assembled active site poised for catalysis. The cross-link itself appears to be conformationally mobile, and the surrounding region is undistorted, suggesting that the cross-link is a structurally passive device that merely acts to prevent dissociation of the catalytic complex. Conclusions: The new strategy discussed here has resulted in the crystallization and structure determination of a catalytically relevant RT·template:primer·dNTP complex. The structure has allowed us to analyze possible causes of drug resistance at the molecular level. This information will assist efforts to develop new classes of nucleoside analog inhibitors, which might help circumvent current resistance profiles. The covalent trapping strategy described here may be useful with other protein–DNA complexes that have been <b>refractory</b> to structural <b>analysis...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{correlation}} between sinus heart rate turbulence (HRT) and short-term prognosis in patients with unstable angina (UA). Seventy‑five patients with UA received Holter monitoring for 24 h, within 48 h of hospitalization to obtain parameters of HRT, including turbulence onset (TO) and turbulence slope (TS), as well as parameters of heart rate variability (HRV), including standard deviation of all NN intervals (SDNN) and average R-R interval. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured with an ultrasound cardiogram. Patients were divided into a stable group and a refractory group based on the prognosis during a 7 - to 21 -day hospital stay. The correlation between the prognosis and each risk factor was analyzed. Of the 75 patients with UA, the pathogenetic condition was stable in 50 patients (stable group) and cardiac events occurred in 25 patients (<b>refractory</b> group). Univariate <b>analysis</b> indicated that the risk factors of short-term poor prognosis of UA include TS ≤ 2. 5 msec/R‑R, age ≥ 70 years, LVEF < 40 % and SDNN < 70 msec. Logistic multivariate regression analysis revealed that only TS ≤ 2. 5 msec/R‑R and LVEF < 40 % were independent risk factors of short-term poor prognosis. Our study revealed that weakening or disappearance of HRT is an independent predictor of short-term poor prognosis in patients with UA...|$|R
