I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew <b>right</b> <b>out</b> and went back on the road.

5|$|Valene Ewing first {{appears in}} Dallas in 1978, {{as the mother}} of Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton) and the ex-wife of Gary Ewing (David Ackroyd, later played by Ted Shackelford), the middle son and the black sheep of the Ewing family. Valene and Gary Ewing were first married in their {{adolescence}} in 1961, when Gary was 17 years old and Valene was 15. When a pregnant Valene persuades Gary {{to take her to the}} Southfork Ranch in order to introduce her to his family, they settle down at Southfork, and Miss Ellie gave Gary a job as ranch foreman. However, Gary and Valene were soon pressured and manipulated by Gary's older brother, J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), who constantly tried to undermine and destroy their marriage. Meanwhile, Gary's father, Jock Ewing, put pressure on Gary to stand up and face his responsibilities for becoming a teenage husband and father-to-be. When Valene gives birth to their daughter Lucy, J.R. makes it clear that the child is an Ewing and will be raised by the Ewings themselves. J.R.'s constant interference causes Gary and Val's marriage to collapse. Under the pressure, Gary fell victim to alcoholism, became violent in the process and walked out on Val and Lucy. With Gary gone, Valene is then driven off Southfork by J.R., but she soon returns to get baby Lucy and flees to Virginia, and later to Tennessee, where she tries to get help from her mother, Lilimae Clements (Julie Harris), to take them in, but they are turned away. At this point, Valene and Lucy had already been tracked down by heavies that were hired by J.R. and the heavies rip Lucy <b>right</b> <b>out</b> of Valene's arms, and take Lucy back to Southfork to be raised by her paternal grandparents. When Valene later tried to take legal action to get Lucy back, J.R. warned Valene that he'd kill her if she came back to the state of Texas. Valene is prevented from seeing her daughter again for many years as a result of this.|$|E

25|$|The Drillers {{came out}} of the gate smoking, {{rattling}} off five straight wins <b>right</b> <b>out</b> of the gate. As a team that had always prided itself on playing defense first, now had also developed a potent offense rolling three full lines. Particularly of notice in this newfound offensive stroke was the play of Nikola Vignjevic. A phenomenally gifted player, his performance in the first season (with the Drillers) was often hit and miss, but come his second season his play was inspired and gave the Drillers the playmaker they long needed up front. Another player that drastically stepped up his game for the 99/00 season was Vignjevic's line mate Rick Titus, always a tenacious defender, he too became a force in the offensive end to the surprise of many.|$|E
25|$|Entering {{the game}} at Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium {{with the passing of}} North Carolina's legendary coach Dean Smith a couple of days before, both Duke and UNC coaches, players and staff all {{gathered}} at center court and held a moment of silence for Smith. Once the game started Duke jumped <b>right</b> <b>out</b> of the gate with an 18-6 lead early in the game thanks to hot shooting. UNC would respond by outscoring Duke 30-22 over the next several minutes of the 1st half to cut Duke's lead down to 40-36 with around 4 minutes left in the 1st half. Duke then went on a 9-0 run over the next 2 minutes to get their largest lead of {{the game at}} 49-36 with 2 minutes left in the half. UNC would score the last 6 points of the half to cut Duke's lead down to 49-42 at halftime. In the 2nd half almost everything went UNC's way as UNC started dominating the post and eventually built their largest lead of the game 77-67 over Duke with 4 minutes left in regulation to complete a 41-18 run over Duke in an 18-minute span. With Duke still trailing UNC 79-72 with around 2 1/2 minutes left in regulation Duke's Tyus Jones would help Duke finish regulation on a 9-2 run over UNC to tie the game at 81 points apiece to send it to overtime. In overtime, the game was filled with missed free throws, missed shots, fouls, turnovers, lead changes and ties with Duke eventually winning the game 92-90.|$|E
25|$|The final major hunting {{method is}} the “walk and grab attack”, {{in which the}} eagle walks {{on the ground and}} {{attempts}} to pull its prey out of cover. This has been used for pulling jackrabbits out of brush but has even been utilized to grab the young of large prey (i.e. deer, sheep and badgers) literally <b>right</b> <b>out</b> from under their mother's legs.Handbook of North American birds. Volume 5'. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. pp. 180-231. Tandem hunting may be done regularly, especially with larger prey items. Reportedly, while hunting in pairs, the male golden eagle flies in front of the female at a higher elevation and usually initiates the attack. Breeding pairs have been recorded hunting jackrabbits cooperatively with one individual following the other at different elevations above the ground. The initial pursuer diverts the prey's attention by stooping while the second flies in unseen to make the kill. A study in Idaho showed that the success rate was lower during tandem hunting (9%) than during solo hunting (29%), but this may have been due to the more difficult nature of the prey targeted during tandem hunts. As a whole birds are reportedly more difficult prey to capture than mammals, so hunting success rates may be lower where birds outrank mammals in importance as prey. Golden eagles are not above scavenging for carrion. In fact, it makes up a significant portion (sometimes a majority) of the diet in winter, when ground squirrels are in hibernation and rabbits and hares tend to be at population lows. In the Greater Yellowstone area, the golden eagle {{was one of the most}} frequent scavengers to attend wolf kill-sites in winter but, unlike common ravens (Corvus corax) and bald eagles, were not frequent at kills left out by human hunters. In many parts of the range (i.e. Alberta, Scotland, Spain, etc.) carrion was readily fed to the young during the breeding season.|$|E

25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it <b>right</b> <b>out</b> of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E
