5000|$|To {{facilitate}} <b>recovery</b> <b>after</b> <b>childbirth,</b> many Korean mothers {{consume the}} {{specific type of}} Korean traditional cuisines, which is commonly called [...] "Sanhujori foods." [...] Common characteristics of Sanhujori foods are summarized as being soft, warm, and refreshing while cuisines with spicy flavors {{are perceived to be}} bad for the postpartum period. Among a variety of Sanhujori cuisines, seaweed soup is most widely consumed by Korean mothers. Researchers demonstrated that seaweed contains a great deal of omega-3 fatty acids, i.e., polyunsaturated fatty acids found in certain seeds and fish, and the soup with seaweed helps to accelerate the recovery time of mothers. Other than seaweed soup, Korean women also eat a variety of exotic, traditional dishes, such as a pig bone soup, ray soup, and dried cod soup.|$|E
5000|$|In Christian {{tradition}} the Churching of Women is {{the ceremony}} wherein a blessing {{is given to}} mothers <b>after</b> <b>recovery</b> from <b>childbirth.</b> The ceremony includes thanksgiving for the woman's survival of childbirth, and is performed even when the child is stillborn, or has died unbaptized.|$|R
5000|$|The rite {{became the}} subject of a good deal of {{misunderstanding}} as many commentators and preachers, in describing its scriptural antecedents, did not explain the concept clearly. Pope Gregory as early as the 6th Century protested any notion that defilement was incurred by childbirth and recommended that women should never be separated from the church in case it was seen as such. [...] As a blessing given to mothers <b>after</b> <b>recovery</b> from <b>childbirth,</b> [...] "it is not a precept, but a pious and praiseworthy custom, dating from the early Christian ages". [...] David Cressy points out that the ceremony acknowledged the woman's labours and the perils of childbirth. At the conclusion of a month <b>after</b> <b>childbirth,</b> women looked forward to churching as a social occasion, and a time to celebrate with friends. For men it marked the end of a month during which they {{had to take care of}} the domestic affairs, commonly referred to as the [...] "gander month". In thirteenth century France the rite focused on the woman's role as wife and mother.|$|R

40|$|An investigative survey {{approach}} {{was used to}} explore social aspects of <b>recovery</b> <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> and to examine changes in functional status {{during the first six}} months post-partum. In addition, this study also explored the relationship between functional status, self-esteem, social support, anxiety and satisfaction with motherhood. The sample consisted of 200 mothers selected from a culturally diverse population residing within the lllawarra and Shoalhaven Districts. These were new mothers who at the time of survey were attending Maternal Child Health Centres and Immunisation Clinics. All had experienced a healthy pregnancy, normal delivery, normal puerperium and delivered a healthy baby between 37 and 42 weeks gestation. Following full ethics approval, prospective participants were approached and provided with detailed information about the project. All ethical considerations were addressed. Questionnaires were mailed to each mother when their infant approached the age of six weeks, three months and six months of age. The questionnaire booklet contained a general demographics form, The Inventory of Functional Status After Childbirth (IFSAC) (Fawcett, Tulman, 2 ̆ 6 Myers, 1998), the Prenatal Psychosocial Profile (Curry, Camplell, 2 ̆ 6 Christian, 1993), the Support Behavior Inventory (Brown, 1986) and the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1983). Although functional status scores increased significantly over the first six months post-delivery, none of the respondents achieved full functional status as measured by IFSAC. A positive correlation was identified between functional status and maternal self-esteem (r = 0. 2077, p = 0. 013). Likewise, an inverse correlation was noted between functional status and maternal anxiety (r = - 0. 2900, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). It was also discovered that satisfaction with support received from one 2 ̆ 7 s partner decreased significantly during the six month survey period (t = 3. 82, df 139, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001) as did satisfaction with support from others (t = 8, df 139, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Recovery of full functional ability for most women requires longer than physiological <b>recovery</b> <b>after</b> <b>childbirth.</b> Full functional status as conceptualised by Fawcett et al. (1988) and as measured by IFSAC was not reached by any of the respondents. Many factors can affect a woman 2 ̆ 7 s ability to assume her motherhood role and integrate that role with her past role responsibilities. Further research is required to improve our understanding of this multidimensional construct, and the complex nature of the social realities of motherhood...|$|E
40|$|Depressive {{and fatigue}} {{symptoms}} are common health concerns {{for women in}} the postnatal period. Few studies have sought to investigate the role of fatigue in the development and maintenance of depressive symptoms. The aim of this paper was {{to examine the relationship between}} depressive symptoms and fatigue over the course of the first 4 years postpartum, in particular focusing on the extent to which fatigue at earlier time points predicted later depressive symptoms and vice versa. Data from over 1000 women participating in a longitudinal study of Australian women&# 039;s physical and psychological health and <b>recovery</b> <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> were used. An autoregressive cross-lagged panel model was tested to assess the mutual influences of fatigue and depressive symptoms across five time points at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months postpartum, and at 4 years postpartum. A complex bidirectional relationship between fatigue and depressive symptoms from 3 months to 4 years postpartum was observed, where fatigue at earlier time points predicted depressive symptoms at later time points, and vice versa. The findings of this study suggest interventions targeting the prevention and management of fatigue may also confer some benefit in improving or preventing the development of depression symptoms in the early parenting period...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{fatigue and}} {{depressive}} symptoms are common {{among women in}} the postpartum period, {{and it has been}} proposed that fatigue is a risk factor for later depression. To progress this research, {{there is a need to}} clarify the conceptual and measurement issue of whether these two sets of symptoms are distinct constructs. There is also a need to determine whether they are distinct constructs beyond the postnatal period. The aim of the study was to assess the construct and discriminant validity of fatigue and depressive symptoms as measured by the SF- 36 Vitality subscale (SF- 36) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at six months and at four years post partum. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: data from over 1000 women participating in the Maternal Health Study, a longitudinal study of women׳s physical and psychological health and <b>recovery</b> <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> were used. FINDINGS: confirmatory factor analysis revealed a two-factor model of fatigue and depressive symptoms represented as distinct but related constructs was a better fit to the data than a one-factor model of fatigue and depression sharing the same underlying construct at both six months and four years post partum. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: this study provides empirical evidence that maternal fatigue and depression in the first year after having a baby and at four years post partum are best understood as separate psychological constructs or experiences. The findings have important implications for clinical practice, in particular underlining the importance of differentiating tiredness from depression. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|The {{negative}} effect of childbirth on mothers' labour supply is well documented, though most studies examine only the short-term effects.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the first}} year after childbirth, 94 % of women {{experience}} one or more major health problems (urinary incontinence, faecal incontinence, perineal pain, back pain). Difficulties in intimate partner relationships and changes affecting sexual health are also common. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate changes in women's health from early pregnancy until four years after the birth of a first child. Methods/design The Maternal Health Study is a longitudinal study designed to fill in some of the gaps in current research evidence regarding women's physical and psychological health and <b>recovery</b> <b>after</b> <b>childbirth.</b> A prospective pregnancy cohort of > 1500 nulliparous women has been recruited in early pregnancy at six metropolitan public hospitals in Melbourne, Australia between April 2003 and December 2005. In the first phase of the study participants are being followed up at 30 – 32 weeks gestation in pregnancy, and at three, six, nine, 12 and 18 months postpartum using a combination of self-administered questionnaires and telephone interviews. Women consenting to extended follow-up (phase 2) will be followed up six and 12 months after any subsequent births and when their first child is four years old. Study instruments incorporate assessment of the frequency and severity of urinary and bowel symptoms, sexual health issues, perineal and abdominal pain, depression and intimate partner violence. Pregnancy and birth outcome data will be obtained by review of hospital case notes. Discussion Features of the study which distinguish it from prior research include: the capacity to identify incident cases of morbidity and clustering of health problems; a large enough sample to detect clinically important differences in maternal health outcomes associated with the method of birth; careful exposure measurement involving manual abstraction of data from medical records in order to explore mediating factors and possible causal pathways; and use of a variety of strategies to improve ascertainment of health outcomes. </p...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} women's health after childbirth in a national Swedish sample by investigating the prevalence {{of a number of}} physical symptoms and self-rated health (SRH). The prevalence of stress incontinence at one year after delivery, and possible predictors, was investigated specifically. Risk factors for poor SRH at two months and one year after childbirth were identified. To further understand what the question of SRH captures in the context of childbirth and early parenthood, the reasoning of new mothers when answering the question 'How would you summarize your state of health at present' at one year after the birth, was explored. For the purpose of Papers I-III, we used selected data from a national Swedish survey (the KUB project [...] Women's experiences of childbirth), investigating women's physical and psychological assessment of childbirth This study was designed as a cohort study in which women were followed by means of three questionnaires from early pregnancy to one year after the birth. Swedish-speaking women were recruited at their first antenatal booking visit, from 593 (97 %) antenatal clinics in Sweden. About 4600 women were eligible. Of the 3455 (75 %) who consented to participate, 3061 answered the first questionnaire, 2762 the second and 2563 the third; 2450 (53 %) filled in all three questionnaires. The representativity of the sample was assessed by comparison with all births taking place in Sweden in 1999, according to the Swedish Medical Birth Register. For the purpose of Paper IV, a qualitative design using the method of combined concurrent and retrospective thinkaloud interviews, followed by a semi-structured interview, was used, The 26 respondents, recruited from Child Health Clinics one year after delivery, were asked to say out loud everything that came into their minds, from the moment they first saw the question until they finally gave their answer. The analysis was guided by a theoretical framework describing four cognitive tasks, usually performed when a respondent answers a survey question: interpretation of the question, retrieval of information, forming a judgment and giving a response. Tiredness, headache, neck, shoulder and low back pain were common problems at two months, as well as one year after childbirth. At two months, pain from cesarean section, dyspareunia, and hemorrhoids were frequent problems, whereas stress incontinence was often reported at one year. Nevertheless, SRH was reported to be 'very good' or 'good' by 91 % of the women at two months after birth, and by 86 % at one year (Paper I). One year after the birth, 22 % of the women had symptoms of stress incontinence but only 2 % said it caused them major problems. The strongest predictor was urinary incontinence (overall leakage) 4 - 8 weeks after a vaginal delivery as well as after a cesarean section. Other predictors in women with a vaginal delivery were: multiparity, obesity and constipation 4 - 8 weeks postpartum (Paper II). Physical problems, such as tiredness, musculoskeletal symptoms and abdominal pain, and emotional problems such as depressive symptoms, increased the risk of poor SRH in both primiparas and multiparas at one or both time points. Negative experience of breastfeeding (2 months) and infant sleeping problems (1 year) were infant-related risk factors in both groups, and prematurity was a risk factor in primiparas at two months. Insufficient social support increased the risk in multiparas. In primiparas, outcome of labor, such as negative birth experience after operative delivery was associated with poor SRH at one year, and perineal pain at two months (Paper III). The qualitative study showed that the question on SRE was a measure of women's general health and wellbeing in their present life situation, but it did not seem to measure <b>recovery</b> <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> specifically. The question on SRH seemed to capture a woman's total life situation, such as family functioning and wellbeing, relationship with partner, the issue of combining motherhood and professional work, level of energy, physical symptoms and emotional problems affecting daily life, stressful life events, chronic disease with ongoing symptoms, body image, physical exercise, and feelings of happiness and joy. Neither childbirth-related events nor some childbirth-related symptoms (urogenital and anal symptoms) were included in women's reasoning (Paper IV). In conclusion, this thesis shows that physical problems were common in early motherhood, but in spite of this, few women assessed their health as poor. Self-rated health mainly captures a woman's total life situation as well as ongoing physical and emotional health problems affecting daily life. The quantitative study suggests that mode of delivery and childbirth experience have long-term effects on SRH, but the qualitative study did not support this finding, showing that more research is needed on long-term effects of childbirth on mothers' experiences of their health...|$|E

40|$|Background Prolonged sexual {{abstinence}} <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> is a socio-cultural {{practice with}} health implications, and {{is described in}} several African countries, including Tanzania. This study explored discourses on prolonged postpartum sexual abstinence in relation to family health <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> in low-income suburbs of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods Data for the discourse analysis were collected through focus group discussions with first-time mothers and fathers and their support people in Ilala, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Results In this setting, prolonged sexual abstinence intended at promoting child health was the dominant discourse in the period <b>after</b> <b>childbirth.</b> Sexual relations <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> involved the control of sexuality for ensuring family health and avoiding the social implications of non-adherence to sexual abstinence norms. Both abstinence and control were emphasised more with regard to women than to men. Although the traditional discourse on prolonged sexual abstinence for protecting child health was reproduced in Ilala, some modern aspects {{such as the use}} of condoms and other contraceptives prevailed in the discussion. Conclusion Discourses on sexuality <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> are instrumental in reproducing gender-power inequalities, with women being subjected to more restrictions and control than men are. Thus, interventions that create openness in discussing sexual relations and health-related matters <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> and mitigate gendered norms suppressing women and perpetuating harmful behaviours are needed. The involvement of males in the interventions would benefit men, women, and children through improving the gender relations that promote family health. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRAKT The {{topic of}} my thesis is women?s {{physical}} exercise <b>after</b> <b>childbirth.</b> Physical exercising {{is a close}} topic to me, which is the reason I have chosen it as the content of my thesis. Physical exercises dutiny confinement play an important role. The body recovers faster and it prevents after-birth difficulties, such as backache, incontinention disorders, descensus uteri, pelvic floor muscles release or abdominal muscles diastasis. The aim of these exersices is to remove the changes that occured in the woman?s body during pregnancy, at childbirth or {{in the period of}} confinement. Exercises can be started as early as 12 - 14 hours <b>after</b> the <b>childbirth.</b> In the thesis I have set two goals and two related hypothese. The first one was to determine the women?s knowledge concerning exercises <b>after</b> <b>childbirth.</b> The other one was to find out what are the sources women get the information concerning exercises <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> from. Hypothesis nr. 1 : Women have information about exercises <b>after</b> <b>childbirth.</b> Hypothesi nr. 2 : Women obtain information concerning exercise after childbirt from midwives at the confinement ward. The research file was made up by women both <b>after</b> a spontaneous <b>childbirth</b> and <b>after</b> caesarotomy, from the period of beány released home from hospital until half a year <b>after</b> <b>childbirth.</b> Quantitative research was performed randomly and furhter in the paediatrician?s surgery of MUDr. Rudolf Láznička in the municipality of Olešník, whit help of anonymous questionnaires. The questionnaire contained 33 questions. In total, 100 questionnaires were distributed, out of which 80 returned. The research part showed that nr. 1 hypothesis was confirmed and nr. 2 hypothesis was disproven.

40|$|Abstract Background Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) is {{the leading}} cause of genital ulcer disease worldwide. The virus can be {{transmitted}} to neonates and there are scarce data regarding incidence of HSV- 2 among women in pregnancy and <b>after</b> <b>childbirth.</b> The aim of this study is to measure the incidence and risk factors for HSV- 2 infection in women followed for 9 months <b>after</b> <b>childbirth.</b> Methods Pregnant women were consecutively enrolled late in pregnancy and followed at six weeks, four and nine months <b>after</b> <b>childbirth.</b> Stored samples were tested for HSV- 2 at baseline and again at nine months <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> and HSV- 2 seropositive samples at nine months <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> (seroconverters) were tested retrospectively to identify the seroconversion point. Results One hundred and seventy-three (50. 9 %) of the 340 consecutively enrolled pregnant women were HSV- 2 seronegative at baseline. HSV- 2 incidence rate during the 10 months follow up was 9. 7 (95 % CI 5. 4 - 14. 4) / 100 and 18. 8 (95 % CI 13. 9 - 26. 1) / 100 person years at risk (PYAR) at four months and nine months <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> respectively. Analysis restricted to women reporting sexual activity yielded higher incidence rates. The prevalence of HSV- 2 amongst the HIV- 1 seropositive was 89. 3 %. Risk factors associated with HSV- 2 seropositivity were having other sexual partners in past 12 months (Prevalence Risk Ratio (PRR) 1. 8 (95 % CI 1. 4 - 2. 4) and presence of Trichomonas vaginalis (PRR 1. 7 95 % CI 1. 4 - 2. 1). Polygamy (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 4. 4, 95 % CI 1. 9 - 10. 6) and young age at sexual debut (IRR 3. 6, 95 % CI 1. 6 - 8. 3) were associated with primary HSV- 2 infection during the 10 months follow up. Conclusions Incidence of HSV- 2 <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> is high and the period between late pregnancy and six weeks <b>after</b> <b>childbirth</b> needs to be targeted for prevention of primary HSV- 2 infection to avert possible neonatal infections. </p...|$|R
