However, such registration is not equivalent to confirmation of share rights. It is a declaratory procedure, mainly providing {{prima facie evidence}} against a third party (Hu and Zhu 2013). In addition, in recent years, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) has gradually weakened the management of company establishment and equity registration (AntBlockchain 2016).

40|$|Abstract Background Because {{both public}} health {{surveillance}} and action are crucial, the authors initiated meetings at {{regional and national}} levels to assess and reform surveillance and action systems. These meetings emphasized improved epidemic preparedness, epidemic response, and highlighted standardized assessment and reform. Methods To standardize assessments, the authors designed a conceptual framework for surveillance and action that categorized the framework into eight core and four support activities, measured with indicators. Results In application, country-level reformers measure both the presence and performance of the six core activities comprising public health surveillance (detection, <b>registration,</b> reporting, <b>confirmation,</b> analyses, and feedback) and acute (epidemic-type) and planned (management-type) responses composing the two core activities of public health action. Four support activities – communications, supervision, training, and resource provision – enable these eight core processes. National, multiple systems can then be concurrently assessed at each level for effectiveness, technical efficiency, and cost. Conclusions This approach permits a cost analysis, highlights areas amenable to integration, and provides focused intervention. The final public health model becomes a district-focused, action-oriented integration of core and support activities with enhanced effectiveness, technical efficiency, and cost savings. This reform approach leads to sustained capacity development by an empowerment strategy defined as facilitated, process-oriented action steps transforming staff and the system. </p...|$|R

S. scoffed at my plans to spend a semester in Canada, since they assumed that Canada was hardly “exotic ” as other Fulbright destinations and merely an extension of the U. S., I am now in a position to stress that the Fulbright Canada program offers a wonderful opportunity to compare differences and similarities between nations that share a border. Precisely because of that shared border and influences in both directions, it is so important for U.

40|$|Most jurisdictions {{maintain}} a registry {{of persons who}} are eligible to vote. To be eligible to vote, a person must be a U. S. citizen, meet a residency requirement, and have attained the age of 18 by Election Day. Persons who have been legally declared insane or mentally incompetent or who {{have been convicted of}} a felony and have not had their civil rights legally restored generally cannot vote, depending on state law. Prior to HAVA (Help America Vote Act of 2002), voter registration rolls were administered by local election officials. HAVA required states to administer voter registration, although not all states have completed the transition to a statewide voter registration system. Only 17 states had a fully functional statewide voter registration system in place for the 2004 election. To register to vote, a person must submit an application to the election authority of the local jurisdiction in which he or she resides. HAVA also requires that first-time registrants provide some form of identification. After the application has been processed, a voter <b>registration,</b> or <b>confirmation,</b> card is usually mailed to the registrant. The card assigns the registrant to a specific precinct and polling place. The registration remains “active ” as long as the registrant lives at his or her original residence address. A person must reregister if he or he moves to a new place of residence or legally changes his or her name. The election authority will usually issue a new card if an assigned precinc...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite broad {{public support}} for organ donation, there is a chronic {{shortage}} of deceased donor organs. We sought to identify community preferences for features of organ donation policies. Methods: A discrete choice study was conducted using an online panel of Australian community respondents older than 18 years. Respondents were presented with scenarios comparing a "new" policy to the current policy. Tradeoffs between 8 policy aspects were quantified using mixed logit and latent class models: registration system, extent of donor family involvement, ease of <b>registration,</b> frequency of <b>confirmation</b> of intent, direct payment, and funeral expense reimbursement, priority for donor 2 ̆ 7 s family, and formal recognition of donation. Results: There were 2005 respondents (mean, 44. 6 years). We found a strong preference for a new policy. Overall, respondents favored a policy that included: some involvement of the donor 2 ̆ 7 s family in the final decision, simple registration processes, less frequent reconfirmation of donation intent, direct payment or funeral expense reimbursement, and formal recognition of donation. However, there was significant preference heterogeneity across respondents, with various respondent groups valuing policy mechanisms differently. Respondents who viewed policy change negatively were also those who {{would be unlikely to}} be organ donors anyway, because they tended to hold negative views toward organ donation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the Australian community are open to alternative organ donation policies including changes to: registration systems, family involvement, and financial and nonfinancial mechanisms. Future policy discussions should not be limited by preconceived notions of what is acceptable to the community, rather informed by actual community values and preferences...|$|R
