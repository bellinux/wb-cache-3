5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which people will be on the jury. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E

25|$|Lincoln's {{personal}} communications, {{even from}} {{around the time of}} his To Whom it May Concern letter, indicate that he might have been willing to privately give ground on slavery. That Lincoln proposed a delayed ratification plan is mentioned by the Augusta Chronicle and Sentinel in June 1865—based on a report by Stephens from after the meeting. From a legal standpoint, Lincoln never believed that the federal government had the authority to ban slavery in the states—thus his constant emphasis on the status of the Emancipation Proclamation as a measure effective only during wartime. According to Paul Escott, Lincoln's moral opposition to slavery did not override his understanding of the Constitution; therefore, Lincoln may have believed that the rebel states would have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> the Thirteenth Amendment if they rejoined the Union.|$|E

The referendum would include the Faroe Islands, but neither Iceland nor Greenland, nor would it include the West Indian Islands, and it would be non-binding in the sense {{that in the case of}} a majority in favour of the sale the parliament would still have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> it.

25|$|In 1970 and 1975, the Budgetary {{treaties}} gave Parliament {{power over}} the Community budget. The Parliament's members, up-until 1980 were national MPs serving part-time in the Parliament. The Treaties of Rome had required elections to be held once the Council had decided on a voting system, but this did not happen and elections were delayed until 1979 (see European Parliament election, 1979). After that, Parliament was elected every five years. In the following 20 years, it gradually won co-decision powers with the Council over the adoption of legislation, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> approve or <b>reject</b> the appointment of the Commission President and the Commission as a whole, and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> approve or <b>reject</b> international agreements entered into by the Community.|$|R

Based on an extensive fieldwork in the province of Van in Turkey's Kurdish region, this book analyzes the substance and the implementation of this law from the lens of the displaced, their lawyers, the civil society in Van and the public officials charged with implementing the law. It questions the assumption that the law provides an efficient transitional justice mechanism capable of repairing the relations between the Turkish state and its Kurdish citizens...|$|R
500|$|Last Order: Final Fantasy VII was {{produced}} and scripted by Madhouse {{and directed by}} Morio Asaka. The decision to create Last Order arose from the positive reaction towards a popular promotional clip created by Madhouse for the game Before Crisis. Madhouse was chosen to produce the OVA partly because of their success with the clip and because the president of Madhouse was very enthusiastic about the project. However, {{the main reason for}} choosing Madhouse was that the company [...] "understood the significance" [...] of making a Final Fantasy VII animation, as it was considered a large responsibility to animate [...] "the most popular game in the FF [...] series." [...] Tetsuya Nomura, the character designer for the Final Fantasy VII series and co-director of Advent Children, acted as the supervising director.

500|$|For feminists, a woman's {{right to}} control her own {{sexuality}} is a key issue. Feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon argue that women have very little {{control over their own}} bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement, and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances. In many cultures, men do not believe that a woman has the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> a man's sexual advances or to make an autonomous decision about participating in sex. Feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that largely deny women the right to decide how to express their sexuality, because men under patriarchy feel entitled to define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In many parts of the world, especially in conservative and religious cultures, marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour. In more liberal cultures, this entitlement {{takes the form of a}} general [...] sexualization of the whole culture. This is played out in the sexual objectification of women, with pornography and other forms of sexual entertainment creating the fantasy that all women exist solely for men's sexual pleasure, and that women are readily available and desiring to engage in sex at any time, with any man, on a man's terms.|$|E

While Christopher Hill, Inc., would have been within its <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> the faulty goods, they were not able to recover compensation because the accepted goods provided to be defective. The House of Lords affirmed the former, but agreed with the trial court that Norsildmel had knowledge of the purpose of the meal and should have had knowledge of the potential toxicity of it for that purpose. While neither Christopher Hill or Norsildmel were primarily in the business of feeding mink, the potential toxicity of the substance to animals in general was already known. Whether the agencies had dealt in Norwegian herring meal for the purpose of feeding mink in the past was immaterial.|$|R

My only fear is that you are too scrupulous and self-sacrificing to {{contemplate}} fairly, and without prejudice, what is best for us all. You will imagine yourself blinded by inclination, and not attend to common sense. Harewood tells me he trusts you have no objection on personal grounds. (I hope this does not sound as if he were presuming; if so, it is my fault. Remember, I am more used to writing 'summaries for the week' than letters on delicate subjects.) But at any rate, my Mettie, I see there is much worth and weight in his affection, and that you could not manage to snub him as entirely as you wanted to do. (Didn't you?) Now, it seems to me, that if you two are really drawn to one another, both being such as you are, it is the call of a Voice that you have no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> or stifle. I do not mean by this that anything immediate need take place; but granting your preference, I think it would be wrong not to avow it, or to refuse, because you scruple to keep him waiting while you may be necessary at home. If you imagine that by such rejection you would be doing better for the children and me, I beg leave to tell you it is a generous blunder. Remember that, as things have turned out, I am quite as much the only dependence for the others as I was seven years ago. I felt this painfully in the spring, when I was doubtful what turn my health would take; and the comfort of knowing you would all have such a man to look to would be unspeakable--indeed, he has already lightened me of much care and anxiety. Do not take this as pressing you. Between this and the end of his leave, there will be time for consideration. Nothing need be done in haste, least of all the crushing your liking under the delusion of serving us. So do not forbid him the house; and unless your objection be on any other score, do not make up your mind till you have seen me. I should of course have been with you instead of writing, {{if it were not for}} Lance. Till I saw the dear little fellow, I had no notion how very ill he has been. The five hours' journey had quite knocked him up, and he was fit for nothing but his bed when he came; but he revived in the evening. I only hope I shall take as good care of him as the first-rate nurses he describes so enthusiastically. That month must have been worth years of common acquaintance. I wish I knew what more to say to show you how glad I am of this day's work, and to persuade you to see matters as I do.-- Ever your loving brother, [...] F. C. UNDERWOOD.|$|E
