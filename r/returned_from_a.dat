5|$|Beginning in March 1964, Supreme Soviet {{presidium}} {{chairman and}} nominal {{head of state}} Leonid Brezhnev began discussing Khrushchev's removal with his colleagues. While Brezhnev considered having Khrushchev arrested as he <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> trip to Scandinavia in June, he instead spent time persuading members of the Central Committee to support the ousting of Khrushchev, remembering how crucial the Committee's support had been to Khrushchev in defeating the Anti-Party Group plot. Brezhnev was given ample time for his conspiracy; Khrushchev was absent from Moscow {{for a total of}} five months between January and September 1964.|$|E
5|$|Financier and philanthropist J. P. Morgan, Jr. <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> two-month trip to Europe in November 1912; {{his wife}} {{followed}} him home the next month.

The next month, opera singers Frieda Hempel and Leon Rains, both headed for appearances with the Metropolitan Opera, arrived on the same voyage as Mrs. Morgan. Hempel, a German soprano, was with the Berlin Royal Opera, and American tenor Rains was with the Saxon Royal Opera of Dresden.|$|E

In a speech in front of 5,000 people in the double {{cantilever}} hangar, {{he talked about the}} importance of the treaty. President and Mrs. Nixon were welcomed home by vice president Gerald R. Ford, who flew from Washington. His daughter Julie Nixon Eisenhower was also in attendance. Nixon resigned from office five weeks later.|$|E

However, around the same time, Crown Prince Taufa'ahau Tupou IV <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> trip to Australia where he realized that some changes should be made to the written Tongan language. Morton began working on a revised draft, but felt unacquainted with Tongan grammar. For a year, he studied the language and finally completely his revision on March 15, 1945. The Tongan version of the Book of Mormon was published in April 1946.|$|E

5|$|President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who had {{recently}} <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> diplomatic visit to the United Nations, visited {{the site of the}} explosion on August 7. She was berated by local residents; some were angry because her surprise visit halted work at the site, and others thought her presence was politically motivated. The president stayed briefly, visited the CEMAR and met Bonfatti. Kirchner's entourage was surrounded by members of La Cámpora, who tried to prevent demonstrations against her and keep journalists and residents at bay.|$|E

5|$|The Way I See It is the 2008 third studio album by American R singer, songwriter, and {{producer}} Raphael Saadiq. After independently releasing his 2004 album Ray Ray, Saadiq continued working on other artists' projects {{and developed a}} partnership with audio engineer Charles Brungardt, who shared the singer's fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment. In 2008, he <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> vacation that inspired him to pursue classic soul music and recorded The Way I See It primarily at his North Hollywood studio with the engineer.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{intended}} to keep {{a few of the}} animals and sell the others to finance its operations, but Mildred Compton <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> visit to the 1973 National Carousel Roundtable convinced that it should instead restore all of them and recreate the working carousel in its planned new building. But no space had been allocated to allow the display of such a large exhibit, requiring the plans to be adjusted. Columns required in the original layout were removed to allow the carousel's installation on the fifth floor.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's home colours {{have been}} the {{inspiration}} {{for at least three}} other clubs. In 1909, Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time; in 1938, Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip. In 1920, Sporting Clube de Braga's manager <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of Os Arsenalistas. These teams still wear those designs to this day.|$|E
5|$|At the Great City Games in Manchester, England in May, he set {{his sights}} on {{breaking}} Tommie Smith's 44-year-old world best mark over a 200m straight. He beat Smith's time of 19.5 by finishing in 19.41seconds – including a first 100m of 9.88 and a first 150m of 14.41seconds. He suffered from hamstring difficulty after the run but returned to compete at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon in July – his first meeting of the 2010 IAAF Diamond League. Running over 200m, he finished in 19.76seconds but was beaten to the line by Walter Dix, who <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> year-long hiatus. A week later he attended the British Grand Prix and, in spite of poor conditions, he gained a victory over his rival Asafa Powell with a 9.93-second run. He set a meet record of 19.72seconds at the Herculis meeting in Monaco later that month, but expressed disappointment with his race execution as Yohan Blake came close to overhauling him at the finish.|$|E
5|$|Flying at {{low level}} {{provided}} protection against fighters as well. Radars {{of the era}} {{did not have the}} ability to look down; if the radar were aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude, the reflection of the ground would overwhelm the signal <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> target. An interceptor flying at normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it. The interceptor could descend to lower altitudes {{to increase the amount of}} visible sky, but doing so would limit its radar range in the same way as the missile sites, as well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time. The Soviet Union would not introduce an interceptor with look-down capability until 1972 with the High Lark radar, and even this model had very limited capability.|$|E

5|$|In 62 BC, Pompey {{returned}} victorious from Asia. The Senate, elated by its successes against Catiline, {{refused to}} ratify the arrangements that Pompey had made. Pompey, in effect, became powerless. Thus, when Julius Caesar <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> governorship in Spain in 61 BC, he found it easy to make an arrangement with Pompey. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, {{now known as the}} First Triumvirate. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements would be ratified. Caesar would be elected consul in 59 BC, and would then serve as governor of Gaul for five years. Crassus was promised a future consulship.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> six-month tour in Afghanistan. Its 9 B-1Bs flew 770 sorties, {{the most}} of any B-1B {{squadron}} on a single deployment. The squadron spent 9,500 hours airborne, keeping one of its bombers in the air at all times. They accounted for a quarter of all combat aircraft sorties over the country during that time and fulfilled an average of two to three air support requests per day. On 4 September 2013, a B-1B participated in a maritime evaluation exercise, deploying munitions such as laser-guided 500lb GBU-54 bombs, 500lb and 2,000lb Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), and Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). The aim was to detect and engage several small craft using existing weapons and tactics developed from conventional warfare against ground targets; the B-1 is seen as a useful asset for maritime duties such as patrolling shipping lanes.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City's {{fortunes}} declined {{during the}} 1980s and 1990s. For a single season, 1998–99, the club fell {{as far as}} English football's third tier. The club did not qualify for European competition in this period. In ordinary circumstances, the club's fifth-placed finish in 1991 and 1992 would have granted a UEFA Cup place. However, English clubs had recently <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> ban issued after the Heysel Stadium disaster. As the UEFA coefficient that determines the number of places per country is based upon performances in European competition over the previous five years, England had a reduced allocation until 1995.|$|E
