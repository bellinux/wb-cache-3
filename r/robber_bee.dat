40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Meliponini bee lost their sting {{apparatus}} (stingless bees), they did not lose their ability to defend themselves. A variety of defensive strategies is described for the group, such as bitting and resin deposition. Defensive behaviours are usually mediated by chemical communication such as alarm pheromones. This study describe the defensive strategies of the stingless bee Melipona flavolineata Friese 1900 towards known pheromone sources, the head secretions of the <b>robber</b> <b>bee</b> Lestrimelitta limao and the mandibular gland extract of conspecifics M. flavolineata workers. The pheromones provoked different defensive reactions. The head secretions of the <b>robber</b> <b>bee</b> repelled returning foragers, elicited the enclosing of the nest entrance tube with batumen balls and agglomeration of workers outside of the box. In contrast, the mandibular gland extract elicited aggression towards the pheromone site, transport of resin and generalised agitated flights. The results confirm the mandibular gland {{as a source of}} alarm pheromone for this specie and also the chemical triggering of defensive response for the known cleptoparasite L. limao. 201...|$|E
40|$|Social insects need {{to defend}} their nest against robbery, {{parasitism}} and predation. The stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula is unique in that it has guards that hover near the nest entrance in addition to guards that stand at the entrance. We tested both the general hypothesis that hovering guards increase the effectiveness with which flying intruders are detected and the specific hypothesis that hovering guards improve the detection of workers of the obligate <b>robber</b> <b>bee,</b> Lestrimellita limao. In an intraspecific study comparing colonies, we found a strong positive relationship {{between the number of}} hovering guards and the distance at which a dummy <b>robber</b> <b>bee</b> or L. limao worker, experimentally moved towards the nest entrance, was detected. These results were mirrored in an interspecific study showing that four species of stingless bees with similar population colonies but which lacked hovering guards, detected L. limao only at the nest entrance, in contrast to T. angustula. In addition, we found that a greater number of attacks by guards occurred when dummies were impregnated with citral, a major component of L. limao mandibular gland odour. Our results support the hypothesis that T. angustula hovering guards increase the detection perimeter for flying intruders, especially L. limao. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that colonies of the stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula have hovering guards that can detect allospecific intruder bees with volatile odours or different body colour, but conspecific intruders were not detected. Here we show that T. angustula colony entrances are also defended by guards standing on the entrance tube. These standing guards made very few errors in recognition, accepting 100 % of the nestmates and rejecting 92 % of the conspecific non-nestmates presented to them at the nest entrance. In addition, 87 % of the nestmates contaminated with odours from the stingless bee Scaptotrigona bipunctata were rejected. Standing guards also reacted to volatile odours from the stingless bees S. bipunctata and Melipona rufiventris by switching to hovering. The defence reaction, i. e. {{the increase in the number}} of hovering guards, was not, however, comparable to the reaction previously reported to citral, the propaganda chemical used by the obligate <b>robber</b> <b>bee</b> Lestrimelitta limao when attacking other bee colonies...|$|E
40|$|Cleptobiotic (<b>robber)</b> <b>bees</b> {{have their}} own nests but steal food from nests of other species, instead of {{collecting}} it from flowers (Michener, 1974). One genus of cleptobiotic Meliponina, Lestrimelitta Friese, occurs in the neotropical region (Michener, 2000) and is represented in Brazil by at least four species (Camargo & Moure, 1990). Raids by Lestrimelitta limao against nests of other bees were described in detail by Sakagami & Laroca (1963) and Sakagami et al. (1993). Workers of this species plunder pollen and honey provisions and other material such as resins and cerumen from colonies of other meliponine bees and even of Apis mellifera (Michener, 1974).

40|$|The {{differentiation}} of workers into morphological castes represents an important evolutionary innovation that {{is thought to}} improve division of labor in insect societies. Given {{the potential benefits of}} task-related worker differentiation, it is puzzling that physical worker castes, such as soldiers, are extremely rare in social bees and absent in wasps. Following the recent discovery of soldiers in a stingless bee, we studied the occurrence of worker differentiation in 28 stingless bee species from Brazil and found that several species have specialized soldiers for colony defence. Our results reveal that worker differentiation evolved repeatedly during the last ~&# 8201; 25 million years and coincided with the emergence of parasitic <b>robber</b> <b>bees,</b> a major threat to many stingless bee species. Furthermore, our data suggest that these robbers are a driving force behind the evolution of worker differentiation as targets of <b>robber</b> <b>bees</b> are four {{times more likely to have}} nest guards of increased size than non-targets. These findings reveal unexpected diversity in the social organization of stingless bees. 201...|$|R
5000|$|The {{underlying}} hypothesis for {{the aggressive}} behavior of African bees {{is based on}} the idea that this race of bees evolved in an arid environment, where the bee's food was scarce. Under this situation, selection favored more aggressive colonies, which protected their food source and hive from predators and <b>robber</b> <b>bees</b> from other colonies. This behavior allowed more aggressive colonies to survive where the less aggressive colonies eventually were selected against by natural selection.|$|R
40|$|Among eusocial bees, two genera evolved a cleptobiotic life strategy, {{stealing}} {{food resources}} from other bee nest instead of collecting it from flowers. Under natural conditions {{there is a}} gradient of strategies against robbing, from more susceptible to highly resistant species. In this work, we describe one attack of the <b>robber</b> <b>bee</b> Lestrimelitta rufipes to a nest of Scaptotrigona sp. in the Amazon Rain Forest (Amazonas, Brazil). The attacked nest was introduced in a beekeeping area with bees already known to be resistant to cleptobiosis. The resident bees (Duckeola ghilianii and Melipona fulva) counter-attacked the robber bees and successfully protect the Scaptotrigona sp. nest. The presence of the defensive behaviour in unrelated genera suggests it evolved many times in social bees. Based on the protective behaviour described here, we suggest {{that in order to}} reduce the damage caused by Lestrimelitta attacks in Amazonian beekeeping, a combination of defensive and non-resistant bees should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Bees {{are well}} known for being industrious pollinators. Some species, however, have taken to invading the nests of other colonies to steal food, nest {{material}} or the nest site itself. Despite the potential mortality costs due to fighting with an aggressive opponent, the prospects of a large bounty can be worth the risk. In this review, we aim to bring together current knowledge on intercolony fighting {{with a view to}} better understand the evolution of warfare in bees and identify avenues for future research. A review of literature reveals that at least 60 species of stingless bees are involved in heterospecific conflicts, either as attacking or victim colonies. The threat of invasion has led to the evolution of architectural, behavioural and morphological adaptations, such as narrow entrance tunnels, mud balls to block the entrance, decoy nests that direct invaders away from the brood chamber, fighting swarms, and soldiers that are skilled at immobilising attackers. Little is known about how victim colonies are selected, but a phylogenetically controlled analysis suggests that the notorious <b>robber</b> <b>bee</b> Lestrimelitta preferentially attacks colonies of species with more concentrated honey. Warfare among bees poses many interesting questions, including why species differ so greatly in their response to attacks and how these alternative strategies of obtaining food or new nest sites have evolved...|$|E
40|$|Division {{of labor}} among workers {{is common in}} insect {{societies}} and {{is thought to be}} important in their ecological success. In most species, division of labor is based on age (temporal castes), but workers in some ants and termites show morphological specialization for particular tasks (physical castes). Large-headed soldier ants and termites are well-known examples of this specialization. However, until now there has been no equivalent example of physical worker subcastes in social bees or wasps. Here we provide evidence for a physical soldier subcaste in a bee. In the neotropical stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula, nest defense is performed by two groups of guards, one hovering near the nest entrance and the other standing on the wax entrance tube. We show that both types of guards are 30 % heavier than foragers and of different shape; foragers have relatively larger heads, whereas guards have larger legs. Low variation within each subcaste results in negligible size overlap between guards and foragers, further indicating that they are distinct physical castes. In addition, workers that remove garbage from the nest are of intermediate size, suggesting that they might represent another unrecognized caste. Guards or soldiers are reared in low but sufficient numbers (1 - 2 % of emerging workers), considering that < 1 % usually perform this task. When challenged by the obligate <b>robber</b> <b>bee</b> Lestrimelitta limao, an important natural enemy, larger workers were able to fight for longer before being defeated by the much larger robber. This discovery opens up opportunities for the comparative study of physical castes in social insects, including the question of why soldiers appear to be so much rarer in bees than in ants or termites.

50|$|When {{cleaning}} infected cells, bees distribute spores {{throughout the}} entire colony. Disease spreads rapidly throughout the hive as the bees, attempting to remove the spore-laden dead larvae, contaminate brood food. Nectar stored in contaminated cells will contain spores and soon the brood chamber becomes filled with contaminated honey. As this honey is moved up into the supers, the entire hive becomes contaminated with spores. When the colony becomes weak from AFB infection, <b>robber</b> <b>bees</b> may enter and take contaminated honey back to their hives thereby spreading the disease to other colonies and apiaries. Beekeepers also may spread disease by moving equipment (frames or supers) from contaminated hives to healthy ones.|$|R

5000|$|Lestrimelitta limao is a neotropical eusocial bee species {{found in}} Brazil and Panama and {{is part of}} the Apidae family. It is a species of stingless bees that {{practices}} obligate nest robbing. They have never been spotted foraging from flowers, an observation that supports their raiding behavior. Because of their lack of hind corbicula, they must raid to obtain enough protein in their diet in the form of pollen and nectar. Lestrimelitta limao secrete a lemon-scented alarm allomone, from which they receive their name, in order to conduct successful raids. L. limao are hypothesized to produce poisonous honey that is toxic if consumed by humans.

40|$|Many Stingless Bees (Hymenoptera: Meliponini) like Tetragonisca angustula collect resin {{to defend}} their nests against intruders like ants or <b>Robber</b> <b>Bees.</b> Small {{portions}} of resin are attached to intruders bodies and extremities causing their immobilization. It has been observed that resin is removed easily from the bee's mandible but adheres strongly to the intruder's cuticle.

The surface structures of the mandible of T. angustula and the trochanter of Camponotus sericeiventris were studied by scanning electron microscopy. To measure adhesion properties, selected surfaces were fixed on a fine glass pin and withdrawn from a glass tip covered with resin. The deformation of the glass pin indicates adhesion forces operating between the resin and the selective surface. The absolute value of the forces is computed from the glass pin's stiffness. It has been shown that resin sticks more to the smooth mandible of the bee than to the structured trochanter of the ant.

40|$|In a {{recognition}} context, discriminating agents {{decide whether to}} accept or to reject. In the honeybee, entrance guards distinguish between nestmates and intruders. Those below a threshold of dissimilarity are accepted. However, the threshold is dependent on ecological conditions and may shift to become either restrictive or permissive, depending on the frequency of intrusion and cost of admitting an intruder. Previous research on the honeybee has shown that both the number of guards and their acceptance threshold to conspecific non-nestmates can change dramatically over weeks owing to changing nectar availability and robbing intensity. This project investigated whether these changes could also occur rapidly, over minutes, in response to sudden increases in conspecific intruders (<b>robber</b> <b>bees).</b> We induced high levels of intrusion at nest entrances and determined changes {{in the number of}} guards, the number of fights per guard, and the acceptance thresholds of guards. Our results show a rapid response within 15 min. At the level of individual guards, acceptance declined from 83 to 55 % for nestmates and 67 to 43 % for conspecific non-nestmates. Also, per individual guard, mean fights increased from 0. 005 to 0. 06 fights/guard. At the colony level, the mean number of guards at the entrance rose from 1. 9 to 2. 3, and overall acceptance in a 3 -min trial declined from 74 to 52 % for nestmates and 59 to 30 % for conspecific non-nestmates. These results show that honeybees can make rapid behavioural shifts at both the colony and the individual levels. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|Differences in {{morphology}} among bumblebee species {{sharing a}} nectar resource {{may lead to}} variation in foraging behaviour and efficiency. Less efficient bumblebees might opportunistically switch foraging strategies from legitimate visitation to secondary robbing when hole-biting primary robbers are present. We observed various aspects of pollination and nectar robbing ecology of Linaria vulgaris in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, with emphasis {{on the role of}} bumblebee proboscis length. Bees can extract nectar from a nectar spur legitimately, by entering the front of the flower, or illegitimately, by biting or reusing holes in the spur. Although L. vulgaris flowers are apparently adapted for pollination by long-tongued bees, short-tongued bees visited them legitimately for trace amounts of nectar but switched to secondary robbing in the presence of primary <b>robbers.</b> Longer-tongued <b>bees</b> removed more nectar in less time than did shorter-tongued bees, and were less likely to switch to secondary robbing even when / 100 % of flowers had been pierced. As the proportion of robbed flowers in the population increased, the relative number of legitimate visits decreased while the relative number of robbing visits increased. Robbing decreased nectar standing crop and increased the proportion of empty flowers per inflorescence. Despite these potentially detrimental effects of robbers, differences in inflorescence use among robbers and pollinators, and the placement of holes made by primary robbers, may mitigate negative effects of nectar robbing in L. vulgaris. We discuss some of the reasons that L. vulgaris pollination ecology and growth form might temper the potentially negative effect of nectar robbing...|$|R
