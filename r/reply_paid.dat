6000|$|Strether's first question, when {{he reached}} the hotel, was about his friend; yet on his {{learning}} that Waymarsh was apparently not to arrive till evening he was not wholly disconcerted. A telegram from him bespeaking a room [...] "only if not noisy," [...] <b>reply</b> <b>paid,</b> was produced for the enquirer at the office, so that the understanding they should meet at Chester rather than at Liverpool remained to that extent sound. The same secret principle, however, that had prompted Strether not absolutely to desire Waymarsh's presence at the dock, that had led him thus to postpone for a few hours his enjoyment of it, now operated to make him feel he could still wait without disappointment. They would dine together at the worst, and, with all respect to dear old Waymarsh--if not even, for that matter, to himself--there was little fear that in the sequel they shouldn't see enough of each other. The principle I have just mentioned as operating had been, with the most newly disembarked of the two men, wholly instinctive--the fruit of a sharp sense that, delightful as it would be to find himself looking, after so much separation, into his comrade's face, his business would be a trifle bungled should he simply arrange for this countenance to present itself to the nearing steamer as the first [...] "note," [...] of Europe. Mixed with everything was the apprehension, already, on Strether's part, that it would, at best, throughout, prove the note of Europe in quite a sufficient degree.|$|E

For the telephone service, still mostly dependent on manual operators, the GPO introduced a programme of building new automated exchanges. For the postal service, the GPO built up a large fleet of motor vehicles to speed delivery, with 3,000 vans and 1,200 motor-cycles. Wood was a strong believer in publicity; he set up an advertising campaign for the telephone system which dramatically increased the number of subscribers, and he established the GPO Film Unit which gained a high aesthetic reputation as well as raising the GPO's profile. Most importantly, Wood transformed the senior management of the GPO and negotiated a practical financial deal with HM Treasury. The civil service post of Secretary to the Post Office was replaced by a director general with an expert board of management. The old financial rules, by which all the GPO's surplus revenue was surrendered to the Treasury had long prevented reinvestment in the business; Wood negotiated a new arrangement under which the GPO would pay an agreed annual sum to the Treasury and keep the remainder of its revenue for investment.|$|E
5000|$|Bligh, in What's the Use of Lectures?, {{argues that}} lectures [...] "represent a {{conception}} of education in which teachers who know give knowledge to {{students who do not}} and are therefore supposed to have nothing worth contributing." [...] Based on his review of numerous studies, he concludes that lecturing is as effective, but not more effective, as any other teaching method in transmitting information. Nevertheless, lecturing is not the most effective method for promoting student thought, changing attitudes, or teaching behavioral skills.Bligh summarises research on memory to show the significance of the meaningfulness of material on retention (Marks and Miller 1964) and the importance of immediate rehearsal of information (Bassey 1968). He relates his own research on arousal during lectures to suggest a decrement in attention during the first 25 minutes. Lloyd (1968) and Scerbo et al. (1992) showed that students take less and less notes as lectures proceed. Bligh shows that after a short break filled by buzz group discussion, attention will recover somewhat. The largest section of Bligh's book is devoted to lecturing technique, particularly the organisation of lectures, how to make a point, the effectiveness of taking notes, the use of handouts, and ways of obtaining feedback.Early editions of the book contained a <b>reply</b> <b>paid</b> evaluation card.

40|$|Introduction: Potentially {{preventable}} {{deaths in}} police custody include those which involve illicit drugs, alcohol and deliberate self-harm. Near miss incidents (NMI) {{that did not}} result in death have a crucial role in understanding risk factors in custody. Such research has not previously been undertaken. A program of research has been developed to study NMI, in order to better identify those at risk in police custody. For the purposes of this research, NMI have been defined as ‘an unplanned and unforeseeable or unforeseen event that could have resulted, but did not result, in human death or may have resulted in injury or other adverse outcomes’. It was intended that the definition although broad, would not include simple accidents (e. g. slipping on urine in a cell) or trivial injury. Aims and methods: The two aims of the study are (a) to determine whether it is realistic to attempt to assess NMI with the intention of identifying information of use in enhancing detainee care and (b) to assess how frequently NMIs occur and whether there are specific patterns. Pilot interviews were conducted with three forensic physicians practising in London, UK to create a structured questionnaire for all forensic physicians working in London. The questionnaire provided the basis of a retrospective recall survey of all forensic physicians working in London as Forensic Medical Examiners. The questionnaire was designed to assess the numbers of NMI, patterns in occurrence and relevant learning points within the previous 6 months. A covering letter, background questionnaire (exploring the background of the medical practitioner), copies of the survey, and <b>reply</b> <b>paid</b> envelopes were sent to each Forensic Medical Examiner (n = 134) in London, contracted to provide forensic medical services for the Metropolitan Police Service.

40|$|Exploring {{relationships}} {{over time}} between psychological distress, perceived stress, life events and immature defense style on disordered eating pathology Phillipa Hay 1, 2 * † and Sarah Elizabeth Williams 1 † Background: Perceived stress, immature defense style, {{depression and anxiety}} and negative life events all {{are known to be}} associated with eating disorders. The present study aimed to investigate the relationships between these factors and their relative strength of association with eating disorder symptoms over time. Methods: This research was embedded in a longitudinal study of adult women with varying levels of eating disorder symptoms and who were initially recruited from tertiary educational institutions in two Australian states. Four years from initial recruitment, 371 participants completed the Eating Disorder Examination- Questionnaire (EDE-Q) for eating disorder symptoms. Kessler- 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K- 10) as a measure of depression and anxiety, a Life Events Checklist as a measure of previous exposure to potentially traumatic events, the Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to determine perceived stress. One year later, in year 5, 295 (878. 7 %) completed follow-up assessments including the EDE-Q. The questionnaires were completed online or returned via <b>reply</b> <b>paid</b> post. Results: All four independent factors were found to correlate significantly with the global EDE-Q score in cross-sectional analyses (all Spearman rho (rs) > 0. 18, p 0. 15, all p < 0. 05). In multivariate linear regression modeling adjusted for age and year 4 global EDE-Q scores, perceived stress and psychological distress scores were significantly associated with year 5 global EDE-Q scores (p = 0. 046 and < 0. 001 respectively).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{health effects}} of {{ultraviolet}} radiation vary according to wavelength, timing and pattern of exposure, personal characteristics and practices. Negative effects include skin cancers, eye diseases and immune suppression; positive effects primarily relate to endogenous vitamin D production which protects against bone disease. Drafting comprehensive guidelines regarding appropriate sun protective behaviours and vitamin D sufficiency is challenging. Advice given by general practitioners is potentially influential because they are widely respected. Methods A survey instrument was developed, pre-tested and provided to practising GP’s, either by on-line link or mailed, <b>reply</b> <b>paid</b> hard-copy. Odds ratios, differences in means, or ratios of geometric means from regression models are reported for potential predictor variables with 95 % confidence intervals. Results Data (demographic, training, practicing, information accessing, confidence in vitamin D knowledge) suitable for analysis were obtained from 1, 089 GPs (32 % participation). Many (43 %) were ‘not at all confident’ about their vitamin D knowledge. Recent information led 29 % to recommend less sun protection during winter months and 10 % less all year. Confidence was positively associated with non-‘Western’ medical training, information sources read and practising in a metropolitan centre with a medical school. Reading the Melanoma Clinical Practice Guidelines was associated with lower estimates {{of the amount of}} summer sun exposure required to obtain adequate vitamin D. Increasing years in practice was negatively associated with provision of recommended advice about summer and winter sun protection. Greater concern about vitamin D than skin cancer was expressed by females and those in practice longer. Conclusions Concern about the potentially negative impact of skin cancer prevention on vitamin D status may undermine appropriate sun protective recommendations. Reading some educational resources was associated with confidence about vitamin D knowledge and a perception that significantly less summer sun exposure was required for those with high sun sensitivity to achieve adequate vitamin D, suggesting a potentially positive impact of such resources. Education could be targeted towards groups least likely to promote existing recommendations. Authoritative guidelines about vitamin D and sun protection would be a valued resource among GPs. Study findings are potentially valuable to help guide public policy and target interventions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Research {{shows that}} some {{young people who}} are at risk for {{acquiring}} hepatitis C have inadequate knowledge of hepatitis C and limited access to harm reduction services. This study investigates the innovative method of using tattoo studios to distribute harm reduction to at risk young people. The study explores the willingness of tattooists to deliver harm reduction as well as the factors that could influence their willingness to deliver harm reduction. These factors include professional identity, client rapport, hepatitis C knowledge, attitudes towards hepatitis C and people who inject drugs (PWID) and perceptions of how controllable injecting drug use is perceived to be. Attempts were made to recruit from the population of New South Wales tattooists using <b>reply</b> <b>paid</b> postal surveys. Due to a lower than expected response additional recruitment strategies were adopted, including expanding into Victoria and Queensland. Additionally, a qualitative in-depth interview component was incorporated into the study to further explore the quantitative findings. Findings from the survey indicated that respondents were willing to deliver harm reduction information relating to hepatitis C, for example the locations of hepatitis C testing services, but were significantly less willing to deliver information on safe injecting practices or needle and syringe programs. The quantitative and qualitative data together suggested that respondents were highly committed to developing rapport with their clients. Consequently, respondents acknowledged clients frequently confided in them like a therapist. Both quantitative and qualitative data illustrated that respondents held negative attitudes towards PWID. However, respondents' overall attitude towards PWID was not associated with their willingness to deliver harm reduction. Finally, the more respondents perceived injecting drug use (IDU) to be {{under the control of the}} individual, the less willing they were to distribute information about safe injecting practices. This study suggests that most tattooists would be willing to deliver harm reduction information regarding hepatitis C to at risk young people. However, before this can occur tattooists' perceptions of IDU should be targeted. This could involve tattooists attending stigma-reduction education workshops. Prior research suggests that such interventions can have a significant impact on participants' perceptions of the responsibility of stigmatised individuals for their stigma...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Despite {{a number}} of {{initiatives}} aimed at increasing the rural doctor numbers, the continuing reality of the rural doctor shortage in Australia is that most rural doctors leave {{after a few months}} or years. Hays explored the reasons why long-term general practitioners (GPs) stay in rural practice and found that personal and professional support and a strong attachment to the community were associated with decisions to remain in rural practice for long periods, while overwork and children’s education concerns contributed most to leaving. 1 Since 2001, numerous initiatives are underway to recruit new graduates and doctors to the bush and as such, their reasons for entering rural practice might be associated with these positive initiatives. This paper builds on previous literature 1 and looks at an established cohort of rural GPs and reports what originally attracted them to rural practice and why they would consider leaving rural practice. Participants Research materials (including consent, information, questionnaire and <b>reply</b> <b>paid</b> envelope) were posted to 286 rural GPs in central and south Queensland in 2005, all with at least 10 years of experience practising in Rural Remote Metropolitan Area (RRMAs) 5 – 7 locations. Methods Two free-response open-ended questions were asked {{as part of a larger}} study questionnaire. The questions were; ‘Please tell us about your original interest in rural medicine’ and ‘Are you considering a change of practice location in the next 5 years?’ All responses were transcribed and a three-level analysis was undertaken as described by Fossey, that is: (i) review, identification and coding of recurrent themes; (ii) identification of common themes; and (iii) collation of identified themes and their frequency quantified. 2 Results The response rate was 43 % resulting in 120 participants. The majority of respondents were; male (n = 84) with an age range between 29 and 71 years (mean age = 48. 7 years), married or partnered (n = 113), Australian medical graduates (n = 113), from a rural background (n = 65) and with a spouse also from a rural background (n = 50). The mean number of years practising as a rural GP in RRMAs 5 – 7 was 23 (range = 10 – 40). The thematic analysis of the data is summarised in Table 1 as a hierarchy of dominant themes with accompanying illustrative quotes...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{investigated}} {{strategies used}} by older and working-aged women to manage urinary incontinence (UI) {{in their daily}} lives. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive study. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample comprised 103 older (> 65 years; mean = 74. 6 years) and 104 working-aged (18 - 65 years; mean = 50. 3 years) community-dwelling Australian women with self-reported UI. They had experienced UI {{for an average of}} 5 years and a majority rated their UI severity as moderate to severe. INSTRUMENT: Based on a comprehensive literature review, a 93 -item author-developed questionnaire was developed and pilot tested to identify the type and frequency of strategies used by participants to manage UI. Items were developed that queried demographic and lower urinary symptom characteristics (type, severity, duration). METHODS: Participants were recruited via public and privately funded continence clinics and an advertisement in a local newspaper, with a 66 % retention rate following recruitment. Questionnaires were posted to participants with a <b>reply</b> <b>paid</b> envelope for return. RESULTS: The women used a range of strategies to manage UI in their daily lives. A large proportion of women from both groups chose to (1) go to the toilet immediately after urge (older 94 %; working-aged 92 %); (2) integrate urine loss management a normal part of everyday life (older 81 %; working-aged 78 %); (3) stopping activities that make them leak (older 85 %; working-aged 83 %); and (4) using pads and aids for urinary containment (older 87 %; working-aged 73 %). Older women were more likely to use most of the strategies identified in the questionnaire. These strategies included the following: stop drinking in the evening (older 64 %; working-aged 43 %; P =. 003); organize their bedroom close to the toilet (older 61 %; working-aged 36 %; P =. 001); limit travel (older 45 %; working-aged 18 %; P = <. 001); limit socializing (older 30 %; working-aged 11 %; P =. 001); and limit new relationships (older 25 %; working-aged 11 %; P =. 01). Respondents engaged in a variety of hygiene measures such as washing (older 86 %; working-aged 60 %; P =. 001), changing pads frequently (older 76 %; working-aged 58 %; P =. 008), and using deodorisers (older 68 %; working-aged 50 %; P =. 008). Working-aged women were more likely to modify (older 17 %; working-aged 70 %; P <. 001) or avoid (older 8 %; working-aged 32 %; P =. 001) sexual activity. CONCLUSION: Both older and younger women aimed to normalize UI in their daily lives, using strategies designed to keep the bladder empty, maintain secrecy, and preserve social continence. Knowledge of these strategies and the difference between older and working-aged women will enable health care professionals to initiate more targeted support and advice for women with UI.
