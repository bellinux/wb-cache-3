5|$|State Democratic Party leaders accused Daniels and the <b>Republicans</b> <b>of</b> passing {{controversial}} legislation only {{to enhance}} Daniels' image {{so he could}} seek the presidency.

5|$|During {{his second}} term as governor, and after being {{partially}} paralyzed by a stroke, {{he was elected to}} serve in the U.S. Senate. He was a leader among the Radical <b>Republicans</b> <b>of</b> the Reconstruction era, and supported numerous bills designed to reform the former Southern Confederacy. In 1877, during {{his second term}} in the Senate, Morton suffered a second debilitating stroke that caused a rapid deterioration in his health; he died later that year. Morton was mourned nationally and his funeral procession was witnessed by thousands. He is buried in Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Eric Foner (2010) {{contrasts}} the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical <b>Republicans</b> <b>of</b> the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, {{with the}} conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet Union {{viewed the}} 1933 {{accession}} of fervently anti-Communist Hitler's government {{to power in}} Germany with great alarm from the onset, especially since Hitler proclaimed the Drang nach Osten {{as one of the}} major objectives in his vision of the German strategy of Lebensraum. The Soviets supported the <b>republicans</b> <b>of</b> Spain who struggled against fascist German and Italian troops in the Spanish Civil War. In 1938–1939, immediately prior to WWII, the Soviet Union successfully fought against Imperial Japan in the Soviet-Japanese Border Wars in the Russian Far East, which led to Soviet-Japanese neutrality and the tense border peace that lasted until August 1945.|$|E

He was a political commentator on the MSNBC cable network, including the show Morning Joe until February 2012, and now appears on Fox News. Buchanan was a regular on The McLaughlin Group from the 1980s until the show ended.

25|$|The {{city was}} besieged by the First Coalition against Revolutionary France in 1793. Following a {{protracted}} Siege of Valenciennes {{the city was}} captured and occupied in July by Anglo-Austrian forces under the Duke of York and the Prince of Saxe-Coburg, and only retaken by the French Revolutionary armies in August 1794. In July 1795, {{one year after the}} execution of Robespierre {{put an end to the}} Reign of Terror, the <b>Republicans</b> <b>of</b> Valenciennes tortured, and guillotined five Ursuline nuns; by some accounts, the nuns were raped before being executed. After the Napoleonic era, Valenciennes gave itself up to the Bourbons in 1815 for 5 years. After that, the town's sugar-refining and coal industries once more started to expand.|$|E

25|$|Obama's {{presidency}} saw {{the continuation}} of battles between both parties over the confirmation of judicial nominees. Democrats continually accused <b>Republicans</b> <b>of</b> stalling nominees throughout Obama's tenure. After several nomination battles, Senate Democrats in 2013 reformed {{the use of the}} filibuster so that it could no longer be used on executive or judicial nominations (excluding the Supreme Court). Republicans took over the Senate after the 2014 elections, giving them the power to block any judicial nominee, and the 114th Congress confirmed just 20 judicial nominees, the lowest number of confirmations since the 82nd Congress. Obama's judicial nominees were significantly more diverse than those of previous administrations, with more appointments going to women and minorities.|$|E
25|$|Tacitus, and {{the theory}} which Bruni based on him, played {{a vital role in}} the {{spirited}} debate between the <b>republicans</b> <b>of</b> Florence and the proponents of monarchy and aristocracy elsewhere. Guarino da Verona, in 1435, used the literary flowering of Augustus's erawhich included Livy, Horace, Virgil, and Senecato argue against Bruni's contention; Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini countered with the argument that all the authors had been born during the waning years of the Roman Republic. Pier Candido Decembrio, a Milanese courtier, addressed the same argument to Bruni in the following year, which Bruni did not bother to rebut, the best counterargument having been made already. The rule of Cosimo de Medici, however, saw the end of these political readings of Tacitus, though his works were now readily available in the public library of Florence. Instead, scholars such as Leone Battista Alberti and Flavio Biondo used him in academic works on the history and architecture of 1st century Rome. His laconic style and bleak outlook remained unpopular.|$|E
25|$|Cavour {{moved to}} {{challenge}} republican unification efforts by Garibaldi by organizing popular revolts in the Papal States and used these revolts {{as a pretext}} to invade the country, even though the invasion angered the Roman Catholics, whom he told that the invasion {{was an effort to}} protect the Roman Catholic Church from the anti-clerical secularist nationalist <b>republicans</b> <b>of</b> Garibaldi. Only {{a small portion of the}} Papal States around Rome remained in the control of Pope Pius IX. Despite their differences, Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. Subsequently, the Parliament declared the creation of the Kingdom of Italy on 18 February 1861 (officially proclaiming it on 17 March 1861) composed of both Northern Italy and Southern Italy. King Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy was then declared King of Italy, though he did not renumber himself with the assumption of the new title. This title had been out of use since the abdication of Napoleon I of France on 6 April 1814.|$|E

25|$|After school Handley {{returned}} home where he joined his father's sales department. Although Handley was an able salesman, {{his company was}} one of many that folded during the mid-1930s because of the continuing Great Depression. Handley took a new job as a salesman at Unagusta Furniture Corporation, a North Carolina furniture company, but in turn folded {{in less than a year}} after he joined it. It was during his period of unemployment that he began to become involved in politics. He formed the Young <b>Republicans</b> <b>of</b> LaPorte County in 1935 and in 1936 he made an unsuccessful run for the Indiana Senate. He remained active in the party and ran for the senate again in 1940 and was elected along with a strong Republican majority to both houses of the body. In the first session of the Indiana General Assembly of his term, he supported the Republican position of repealing almost a decade of Democratic legislation, and reorganizing the executive branch of the government to decentralize control away from the governor.|$|E
500|$|The {{lessening}} {{of the war}} threat, and {{the choice}} by the <b>Republicans</b> <b>of</b> the popular Elbridge Gerry as their candidate brought a challenge to Federalist control of Massachusetts in the 1810 elections.

[...] Gerry won the election. [...] Jackson did visit Boston, but he was greeted not by Gore, but Gerry. [...] Gore ran against Gerry again in 1811, but lost in another acrimonious campaign.|$|E
500|$|In January, caucuses {{were held}} in local districts to pick delegates. The state {{conventions}} would then select {{a number of these}} delegates to represent the state at the national convention. Prior to the convention, {{there was a great deal}} of machine politics conducted by the candidates. John Sherman utilized Treasury Department employees who owed their jobs to him to meet up at local caucuses across the South to guarantee loyal state delegations. State-level bosses, like Roscoe Conkling, used the state conventions to pick delegates that were politically allied to a particular candidate. In the state delegate-selection convention at Utica, New York, Grant's supporters carried only a 217–180 majority over Blaine supporters, but Conkling passed a resolution declaring that, [...] "the <b>Republicans</b> <b>of</b> New York believe the re-election of Ulysses S. Grant as Presidential candidate of urgent importance, and the delegates this day assembled are called upon and instructed to use their earnest and united efforts to secure his nomination.|$|E

500|$|The Republicans were {{initially}} no less divided than the Democrats. Senator William J. Deboe backed Taylor for governor. Governor Bradley backed Judge Clifton J. Pratt of Hopkins County, and the <b>Republicans</b> <b>of</b> Central Kentucky backed state auditor Sam H. Stone. Taylor organized a strong political machine and seemed in a solid position {{to obtain the}} nomination. Bradley was incensed that the party would not unite behind his candidate and boycotted the convention. Taylor unsuccessfully tried to woo him back with a promise to make his nephew, Edwin P. Morrow, secretary of state. Because Taylor represented {{the western part of}} the state, the so-called [...] "lily white" [...] branch of the Republican Party, black leaders also threatened not to support him; Taylor responded by hiring one of the black leaders his permanent secretary, and promised to appoint other black leaders to office if he won the election. Seeing that Taylor's nomination was likely, all the other candidates withdrew, and Taylor won the nomination unanimously.|$|E
500|$|Three {{days after}} the straw poll, McCotter wrote an article in National Review {{outlining}} some of his economic plans. [...] He advocated spending reductions, a twenty percent reserve requirement for banks to keep available as capital, and incentives to reduce home foreclosures.

Cupp for the Young <b>Republicans</b> <b>of</b> Seacoast. He returned to Iowa for his last campaign stop in the state from August 24 to August 27.

[...] He failed to meet the requirements for both the September 7 MSNBC and the September 12 CNN debates. For the MSNBC debate, a candidate had to show one poll with four percent support. McCotter argued that while he did not meet this, in a Quinnipiac poll, he tied with Rick Santorum and Jon Huntsman, Jr., both of whom qualified. Other candidates who did not qualify included Gary Johnson and former Louisiana governor Buddy Roemer, who like McCotter, did not qualify for any televised debates.|$|E
