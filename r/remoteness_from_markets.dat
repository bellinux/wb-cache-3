The article critiques the core features of this approach, and proposes in turn to discuss and profile the development trajectories of small economies from the vantage point of the strategic flexibility used by small states (at multiple levels as individuals, household units, corporate entities and complete jurisdictions) in seeking to exploit opportunities and maximize economic gains in a turbulent and dynamic external environment with which they must engage.

30|$|The primary {{requirements}} for pastoralist production in ASAL are livestock, labour, {{and access to}} key grazing and water resources. Commonly favourable terms of trade for pastoral produce against grain {{make it possible for}} people to make a living selling milk or meat from even relatively low herd numbers (Swift 1986; Sikana et al. 1993). Despite long-term declines, and the effects of subsidised meat and milk products being dumped on African markets (e.g. The Economist 1993; Oxfam 2002), broadly favourable terms of trade still underpin successful pastoral economies (Zaal and Dietz 1999; Dietz et al. 2001; Zaal et al. 2006), although drought or epidemic can precipitate rapid collapse into famine (Homewood 2008). Physical <b>remoteness</b> <b>from</b> <b>markets</b> is often a major constraint (McPeak and Little 2006; McPeak et al. 2012), and transhumant movements may in part be dictated by market potential.

40|$|Abstract: It took a {{half century}} after American forest {{entomology}} began before insect damage in the AlaskaTerritory came into prominence. This account tells of a spruce beetle outbreak in prime old-growth Sitka spruce on Kosciusko Island in southeast Alaska and its significance {{to the establishment of}} forest entomology in that remote region. In 1946, at the request of Alaska Regional Forester, Frank Heintzleman, forest entomologist Robert L. Furniss was dispatched from Oregon to determine the cause and extent of the spruce mortality. In those days, travel to remote coastal forests such as those on KosciuskoIsland in the TongassNational Forest was provided by a fleet of Forest Service boats. Information presented is based on the diary and photos of Frances Furniss who accompanied her husband, and reports written after the survey. From the time of America’s purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867 until statehood in 1959, Alaska was a vast, relatively unpopulated, U. S. territory. Its <b>remoteness</b> <b>from</b> <b>markets</b> and perhaps lack of voting representation in Washington, contributed to a lag in managing and utilizing its forest resources. That began to change after WW II with increased demand for wood products. As a consequence, destructive agents such as insects gained in prominence.

In remote Australia, {{access to}} people, goods, services, information and places {{is difficult because}} of extreme distances and climates, sparse population, <b>remoteness</b> <b>from</b> <b>markets,</b> and complex economic and socio-cultural dynamics. Most of remote Australia remains disconnected from both the digital revolution and the national transport network {{due to a lack}} of adequate infrastructure, affordable and reliable services, and, for most, poor digital literacy. This impedes service delivery including education and health services, economic development and wellbeing of remote residents; contributing to inequalities between remote and non-remote Australians. Whilst the concept of accessibility in transport and telecommunication goods and services is relatively well defined in an urban context and can be measured accordingly, the way accessibility is currently measured fails to capture the complexity of the remote Australian context. The article discusses some of the current knowledge gaps associated with studying accessibility levels in remote Australia with a particular focus on Central Australia. The article presents indicators and tools which could be used to evaluate access issues with practical applications for remote Australia. Developing an accessibility index for remote areas would enable the reconsideration of minimal requirements for sustainable livelihoods in remote areas and the development of effective and appropriate regional development policies and initiatives...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the quality of}} exports depends on relative country size and its remoteness. Specific transportation cost is the key variable in our analysis as it {{gives rise to the}} Alchian-Allen effect. In the model, we allow for endogenous quality choice by a producer serving many international locations. Higher quality comes at higher marginal cost of production, but can be delivered at the same absolute, and thus proportionally lower, transportation cost to a given destination. Our model complements the well documented demandside response to the distribution of transportation costs (known as the Alchian-Allen effect) by the supply side response. We show that, ceteris paribus, equilibrium quality decreases in the domestic country size and increases in <b>remoteness</b> <b>from</b> foreign <b>markets.</b> This happens because a larger portion of the demand is affected by the Alchian-Allen effect for smaller countries’ producers, and the Alchian-Allen effect is stronger for remote countries. We confirm our predictions empirically on a detailed product level dataset of all exporters worldwide into a sample of Latin American importers. ...|$|R
40|$|Although the Australian economy {{expanded}} {{significantly in}} terms of its market sector development over the past four decades, the productivity growth has been stalled since 2000. Productivity growth (particularly multi-factor productivity) is of interest to policy makers because it reflects improvements in efficiency which can be fostered through enhanced innovation capabilities. Although typically linked to structural adjustment and microeconomic reforms, development and diffusion of information technologies {{played a significant role in}} productivity gains in the Australian context. The Australian Government is currently investing $ 37. 4 billion to build an open access communication infrastructure, National Broadband Network (NBN), to deliver high-speed broadband services at affordable prices to all Australian premises. This will promote efficiency, productivity and new opportunities for all Australians, irrespective of their residence location. By removing Australia's <b>remoteness</b> <b>from</b> major <b>markets,</b> an NBN-empowered digital economy is expected to improve productivity and efficiency in the use of resources. However, the NBN rollout presents challenges too for Australia. The NBN will help address the urban-regional digital divide, however, it will not close the gap. It leaves key question unexplored: whether another type of inequality is emerging within rural and regional Australia in the form of digital literacy disparity. Targeted strategies are therefore required to drive broadband deployment and adoption in regional areas. ...|$|R

40|$|Pacific {{economies are}} confronted with several {{structural}} constraints that limit their economic growth, most importantly their small size and <b>remoteness</b> <b>from</b> major world <b>markets.</b> In this paper we study the importance of transport connectivity for Pacific economies when participating in the world economy.

Combining both datasets with the corresponding trade flows allows us to assess the importance of connectivity for the Pacific's trade performance. Using a gravity model approach, we find that a direct shipping connection more than doubles trade in goods. Similarly, countries with direct flight connections to the sending country welcome twice as many tourists. The frequency of transport connections is similarly important. Using an instrumental variables approach we are able to confirm the robustness of our results...|$|R

Consequently Afghanistan has {{a high percentage of}} small to medium enterprises (SMEs’) that remain small and fail to realize their growth potential. The key elements of today’s business strategies are alliances to compete for a market leadership position. This study narrates the role of strategic alliances as an instrument for rapid growth by Afghanistan based service/construction firms. This study examines the experiences of a small number of such firms in relation to their role of strategic alliances. By recognizing concepts that positively or adversely affect the likelihood of success of such alliances it is hope that future firms within Afghanistan can benefit from thesis findings when developing their own growth strategies. The qualitative technique of semi-structured in depth interviews was used to gather primary data in response to the research questions. This research shows that the key contributor to the success for failure of alliances is whether all the parties will benefit equitable from the venture and the relative strategic importance of the alliance to the stakeholder. A new finding of special relevance to Afghanistan business is that being construction and is crucial to attracting the best alliance partners. Strategic alliances are not a panacea for every firm and at every situation. However through strategic alliances...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} why informal labourers working ‘at the margins’ {{of global}} production networks lack ‘structural’ and ‘associational’ power. It {{does so in}} order to better understand potential changes in their material and political conditions, and as part of broader calls to put labour at the centre of development studies. The article focuses on rural-based labourers in south India who work relatively invisibly as agricultural labourers, informal factory workers, and on the construction sites of a ‘global city’ (Bangalore). It deploys a three-way labour control regime framework that encompasses i) the macro-labour control regime, which is ultimately defined by capitalist relations of production, and characterized in India by particularly high levels of informality (precarious and largely unregulated work) and segmentation (due to the fragmentary impact of caste); ii) the local labour control regime, which refers to how class relations in specific places are shaped by patterns of accumulation and work (themselves shaped by differences in agro-ecology, irrigation, and <b>remoteness</b> <b>from</b> non-agricultural labour <b>markets),</b> distributions of classes and castes, and the uneven presence of the state; and iii) the labour process, which is increasingly marked by forms of ‘remote control’ marshalled by labour intermediaries. Debate on the macro-labour control regime and on the labour process is well established, but little has been said about local labour control regimes, which are newly defined here and discussed in terms of differences between ‘wetland/circulation zones’ and ‘dryland/commuting zones’. The article identifies locations where labour has greater potential structural and associational power. Increased worker organisation in these areas could have knock-on effects in more ‘obscure’ sites...|$|R

40|$|The uneven {{distribution}} {{of economic activity}} in Russia promotes the differentiation of its constituent entities by level of development. Regions are independent participants of economic relations, and they often act as competitors rather than partners. Agglomeration effects arise in more successful regions {{and contribute to the}} concentration of resources, manufacturing enterprises, service providers, skilled workers, and scientific and technological knowledge. The aim of the study, the results of which are reflected in the paper, is to identify the factors and assess their impact on the concentration (dispersion) of economic activity on the basis of Russia’s regions. The paper describes the benefits of agglomeration processes from the standpoint of economic geography, allocation theory and international trade theory. The concentration of economic activity in Russia’s regions is estimated by the Herfindahl–Hirschman index of industrial production taking into consideration the volume of investments in fixed capital and the number of people employed in the economy in Russia’s regions in 1990 – 2013. It is determined that fixed capital investments have the propensity to concentrate, but react strongly to economic crises. Labor resources, by contrast, are distributed relatively evenly, and their concentration in certain regions is increasing steadily. The article considers key factors such as wage growth, distance to large cities, direct foreign investment, road network density, the degree of development of the services sector in the region. The factor model is constructed using the least squares method. The authors conclude that the growth of wages in the region (relative to national average) has a negative effect on the concentration of economic activity. There is a positive correlation between the growth of direct foreign investment and the density of hard surface roads. The development of services has the greatest positive impact on agglomeration processes in Russia’s regions. The paper confirms the point of the new economic geography concerning the negative impact that the region’s <b>remoteness</b> <b>from</b> major <b>markets</b> exerts on the development of agglomeration process. The authors agree with foreign researchers {{on the fact that the}} emergence and development of agglomeration process is influenced by increasing returns to scale, transport costs and labor migration. But the very indirect factors included in the model are influenced by economic actors in the regional socio-economic polic...|$|R
