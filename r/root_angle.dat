40|$|Genotypic {{variability}} in root system architecture {{has been associated}} with <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> of seedlings and water extraction patterns of mature plants in a range of crops. The potential inclusion of <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> as a selection criterion in a sorghum breeding program requires (1) availability of an efficient screening method, (2) presence of genotypic variation with high heritability, and (3) an association with water extraction pattern. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the feasibility for inclusion of nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> as a selection criterion in sorghum breeding programs. A high-throughput phenotypic screen for nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> in young sorghum plants has recently been developed and has been used successfully to identify significant variation in nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> across a diverse range of inbred lines and a mapping population. In both cases, heritabilities for nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> were high. No association between nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and plant size was detected. This implies that parental inbred lines could potentially be used to asses nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> of their hybrids, although such predictability is compromised by significant interactions. To study effects of nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> on water extraction patterns of mature plants, four inbred lines with contrasting nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> at seedling stage were grown until at least anthesis in large rhizotrons. A consistent trend was observed that nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> may affect the spatial distribution of root mass of mature plants and hence their ability to extract soil water, although genotypic differences were not significant. The potential implications of this for specific adaptation to drought stress are discussed. Results suggest that nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> of young plants can be a useful selection criterion for specific drought adaptation, and could potentially be used in molecular breeding programs if QTLs for <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> can be identified.

40|$|Nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> in sorghum {{influences}} {{vertical and}} horizontal root distribution in the soil profile and is thus relevant to drought adaptation. In this study, we report {{for the first time}} on the mapping of four QTL for nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> (qRA) in sorghum, in addition to three QTL for root dry weight, two for shoot dry weight, and three for plant leaf area. Phenotyping was done at the six leaf stage for a mapping population (n = 141) developed by crossing two inbred sorghum lines with contrasting <b>root</b> <b>angle.</b> Nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> QTL explained 58. 2 % of the phenotypic variance and were validated across a range of diverse inbred lines. Three of the four nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> QTL showed homology to previously identified <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> QTL in rice and maize, whereas all four QTL co-located with previously identified QTL for stay-green in sorghum. A putative association between nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> QTL and grain yield was identified through single marker analysis on field testing data from a subset of the mapping population grown in hybrid combination with three different tester lines. Furthermore, a putative association between nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> QTL and stay-green was identified using data sets from selected sorghum nested association mapping populations segregating for <b>root</b> <b>angle.</b> The identification of nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> QTL presents new opportunities for improving drought adaptation mechanisms via molecular breeding to manipulate a trait for which selection has previously been very difficult...|$|E
40|$|Root {{architecture}} {{traits in}} wheat {{are important in}} deep soil moisture acquisition and {{may be used to}} improve adaptation to water-limited environments. The genetic architecture of two root traits, seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and seminal root number, were investigated using a doubled haploid population derived from SeriM 82 and Hartog. Multiple novel quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified, each one having a modest effect. For seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle,</b> four QTL (-log 10 (P) > 3) were identified on 2 A, 3 D, 6 A and 6 B, and two suggestive QTL (-log 10 (P) > 2) on 5 D and 6 B. For root number, two QTL were identified on 4 A and 6 A with four suggestive QTL on 1 B, 3 A, 3 B and 4 A. QTL for <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and root number did not co-locate. Transgressive segregation was found for both traits. Known major height and phenology loci appear to have little effect on <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and number. Presence or absence of the T 1 BL. 1 RS translocation did not significantly influence <b>root</b> <b>angle.</b> Broad sense heritability (h 2) was estimated as 50 % for <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and 31 % for root number. <b>Root</b> <b>angle</b> QTL were found to be segregating between wheat cultivars adapted to the target production region indicating potential to select for <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> in breeding programs. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
30|$|We ran GWASs on <b>root</b> cone <b>angle</b> in indica and japonica {{panels of}} {{intermediate}} size, which were genotyped with two large sets of markers. The <b>root</b> cone <b>angle</b> was assessed {{in a total}} population of 331 accessions and enabled the identification of accessions with exceptionally wide <b>root</b> cone <b>angles.</b> This phenotype seems relatively frequent in O. sativa and distributed in different varietal groups. In our japonica panel, these accessions included all those belonging to the bulu ecotype, confirming the results obtained by Ueno and Sato (1989, 1992) and a few temperate japonica lines from South Asia {{that had not yet}} been identified as carrying such mutations. Ueno and Sato (1992) also found accessions with wide <b>root</b> cone <b>angle</b> among the aus and boro ecotypes from India and tjereh from Indonesia that belong to the indica subspecies. We did not find any such line in our indica panel, but these specific ecotypes were represented by very few accessions, probably too few to detect the mutation. Not considering mutants, the <b>root</b> cone <b>angles</b> of the indica and japonica panels largely overlapped, while indica accessions are said to be generally shallow rooted and japonica accessions to be deep rooted (Lafitte et al. 2001). One could wonder whether this result is specific to our phenotyping system. However, Uga et al. (2009), using the 3 D basket system, also concluded that {{there was no significant difference}} in the distribution of an index based on <b>root</b> cone <b>angle</b> between the indica and japonica groups. On an accession basis, Clark et al. (2011), using a gellan gum culture system, did not find differences in <b>root</b> initiation <b>angle</b> between IR 64 and Azucena, our two controls in the present study that are nonetheless known to have contrasting root depths (Yadav et al. 1997). These results confirm those from Abe and Morita (1994) that the link between narrow <b>root</b> cone <b>angle</b> and increased <b>root</b> depth cannot be generalized in rice.|$|R
30|$|These results led us {{to assume}} that the wide <b>root</b> cone <b>angle</b> trait could be {{controlled}} by different mutations in the J 4 and J 6 subpopulations. It was not possible to test this hypothesis with J 4 since all alleles specific to the subpopulation would have appeared associated with the mutation. However, it was possible to avoid structural problems with J 6, since J 6 was composed of only accessions of the two tails of the distribution. The same approach as above was therefore applied to J 6. The allele frequency among the three accessions of J 6 with open <b>root</b> <b>angles</b> was compared to the allele frequency among the 7 accessions with narrow <b>root</b> <b>angles.</b> Because of the very small size of the sample, only the extreme situation (one allele present in one group and absent in the other or vice versa) was considered. This time, 367 and 132 markers distributed in cluster on different chromosomes were found discriminant within J 6 for the variant and the reference alleles, respectively. However, all these markers segregated {{in the rest of the}} population, with at best a ratio of 2 accessions with the reference or variant alleles compared with 155 with the complementary one.|$|R

The aims of this study were to (1) develop a screening method for nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> in sorghum seedlings, (2) identify genetic variation for this trait in a diverse range of sorghum inbred lines and hybrids, (3) assess the functional implications of such variation on water extraction patterns of mature plants, and (4) identify QTLs for nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> to facilitate selection for the trait in molecular breeding programs. Screening for <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> of seedlings was done in small custom-made root chambers. Nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> varied from 15 º to 50 º (relative to the vertical), and this genetic variation was independent of plant size. In hybrids, differences in nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> were associated with the male parent and with interactions between male and female parents, indicating significant specific combining ability. Two QTLs for <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> were identified and these were unrelated to QTLs for plant size. Selected lines with contrasting <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> were grown in large chambers to assess implications on water extraction in mature plants. Lines with narrow angle tended to extract more water at depth below the plant, whereas wide angled lines tended to increase lateral water extraction. Results indicate that nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> in the seedling stage can potentially affect water extraction patterns of mature plants, and that this trait is independent of plant size, suggesting it could be a useful trait to improve drought tolerance of sorghum...|$|E
30|$|The {{means for}} RA {{in our study}} {{were similar to those}} {{reported}} by Grift et al. (2011), but the range of observations extended slightly below 40 ° and above 100 degrees. The environments had no effect on the generation means of RA. This is interesting considering the strong influence of the environment on the other root architecture features. <b>Root</b> <b>angle</b> may be determined relatively early during plant growth, specifically as a response to plant competition within the row, and be less responsive to later environmental conditions. Factors such as differences in soil texture and fertility that were not tested in our study may influence root angles on a population-wide basis, though Troyer (1996) notes that hybrid by soil type interactions on performance of commercial germplasm were not frequently observed. Trachsel et al. (2011) rated brace <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> visually on a scale of 1 – 9 and crown <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> on a scale of 3 – 9 using dug and cleaned root cores from 98 B 73  × Mo 17 derived RILs, a subset of the inter-mated B 73  × Mo 17 (IBM) population, evaluated in three environments. They reported that the most repeatable root architecture trait for the IBM population in their study was crown <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> at 67 %. As our method for calculating RA does not involve removing brace roots, it can be understood more as a brace <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> measurement, though lines and hybrids are known to differ in the number of nodes they form brace roots from, which can influence the <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> calculation. Our RA measure is one of root topology, regardless of whether crown or brace roots form the outer perimeter of a root system. Across a larger set of RILs chosen for root architecture diversity, the Spearman-rank correlation between brace and crown <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> in Trachsel et al. (2011) was about 0.5. While brace <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> may differ from crown <b>root</b> <b>angle,</b> brace roots comprise the bulk of post-embryonic root biomass at maturity (Fig.  1), so <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> measurements based on them may be more related to other traits of interest.|$|E

The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the extent of genetic variation in nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> of sorghum and to quantify the general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) for the trait. A diverse range of inbred lines and hybrids was grown in custom-made containers in a glasshouse. Plants were harvested when six leaves had fully expanded and encompassing angle of first flush of nodal roots (relative to vertical), leaf area, and root and shoot dry weight were determined for each plant. Nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> ranged from 15 to 50 degrees for inbred lines and 14 to 43 degrees for hybrids and had a moderately high heritability (47 %) in inbred lines. However, significant interaction between male and female parents in hybrids indicated significant SCA. Variation in nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> was independent of variation in plant size (shoot and root weight and leaf area). Variability in plant size among hybrids was associated with the female parent (p < 0. 001) and resulted in significant GCA. Screening and selection for nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> should not be affected by potential differences in plant size between inbred lines and hybrids, although the significant SCA would limit predictability of <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> in hybrids based on the <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> of the parental inbred lines...|$|E
30|$|Plant root systems play a {{major role}} in {{anchoring}} and in water and nutrient uptake from the soil. The <b>root</b> cone <b>angle</b> is an important parameter of the root system architecture because, combined with root depth, it helps to determine the volume of soil explored by the plant.

30|$|To {{find other}} QTLs linked to <b>root</b> cone <b>angle,</b> a {{genome-wide}} association mapping {{study was conducted}} on two panels of 162 indica and 169 japonica rice accessions genotyped with two sets of SNP markers (genotyping-by-sequencing set with approximately 16, 000 markers and high-density-rice-array set with approximately 300, 000 markers). The <b>root</b> cone <b>angle</b> of all accessions was measured using a screen protractor on images taken after 1 month of plant growth in the Rhizoscope phenotyping system. The distribution of the <b>root</b> cone <b>angle</b> in the indica panel was Gaussian, but several accessions of the japonica panel (all the bulus from Indonesia and three temperate japonicas from Nepal or India) appeared as outliers with a very wide <b>root</b> cone <b>angle.</b> The data were submitted to association mapping using a mixed model with control of structure and kinship. A total of 15 QTLs for the indica panel and 40 QTLs for the japonica panel were detected. Genes underlying these QTLs (+/− 50  kb from the significant markers) were analyzed.

40|$|Water {{availability}} {{is a major}} {{limiting factor}} for crop production, making drought adaptation and its many component traits a desirable attribute of plant cultivars. Previous studies in cereal crops indicate that root traits expressed at early plant developmental stages, such as seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and root number, are associated with water extraction at different depths. Here, we conducted the first study to map seminal root traits in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Using a recently developed high-throughput phenotyping method, a panel of 30 barley genotypes and a doubled-haploid (DH) population (ND 24260 × 'Flagship') comprising 330 lines genotyped with diversity array technology (DArT) markers were evaluated for seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> (deviation from vertical) and root number under controlled environmental conditions. A high degree of phenotypic variation was observed in the panel of 30 genotypes: 13. 5 to 82. 2 and 3. 6 to 6. 9 ° for <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and root number, respectively. A similar range was observed in the DH population: 16. 4 to 70. 5 and 3. 6 to 6. 5 ° for <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and number, respectively. Seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seminal root traits (<b>root</b> <b>angle,</b> two QTL; root number, five QTL) were detected in the DH population. A major QTL influencing both <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and root number (RAQ 2 /RNQ 4) was positioned on chromosome 5 HL.

40|$|On Australian soils, {{where water}} is only {{available}} at depth during the grain filling period, growing deep rooting cultivars increased wheat yields by approximately 15 %. Seedling <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> {{is associated with}} adult root system depth in Australian field-grown wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.), {{but it is not}} yet known whether selection for <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and rooting depth could benefit UK wheats. A soil-based, 3 D, basket pot screen identified distinct <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> phenotypes (ranging from 35 ° to 52 ° from the vertical) among a selection of UK commercial cultivars. These phenotypes were generally stable despite varying soil water content, soil strength, and aerial temperature, but two cultivars showed significant changes in <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> in response to soil moisture. Cultivars Istabraq and Battalion displayed contrasting shallow and deep root angles, respectively. In fully factorial pot trials, with contrasting vertical soil moisture gradients and terminal drought treatments, genotype did not significantly affect early growth and physiology of young (tillering) wheat plants, but there were significant interactions with moisture gradient and water availability in some treatments. Under soil drying, ABA-mediated stomatal closure maintained Ψleaf in Battalion, whereas leaf decreased in Istabraq in the absence of changes in foliar ABA concentrations. This suggests contrasting water use strategies (isohydric Battalion and anisohydric Istabraq) are responsible for the observed physiological differences, rather than <b>root</b> <b>angle.</b> Field trials investigated whether these laboratory observations were correlated with root system development and yield of mature fieldgrown wheat. Soil cores taken from experimental wheat plots at Rothamsted Research’s Woburn farm were split at 10 cm intervals, and the number and positioning of roots and bio-pores at the exposed faces counted. Roots were washed from core sections to measure root length density by depth. Root length density declined with soil depth in all cultivars, and was not associated with seedling <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> phenotype, nor did yield correlate with root system traits. In the drier year only, Battalion had the most roots in the surface soil layers, which experienced greater soil drying under Battalion than under other cultivars. These studies contribute to the growing body of research on root system ideotypes in rainfed temperate climates, by identifying genetic variation in seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> in high performing commercial wheat cultivars. While seedling <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> was not correlated with yield in field trials, it was associated with ability of roots to penetrate hard soils and access water in deeper strata of the soil profile. These traits would be especially beneficial during the grain-filling phase, and may potentially increase UK wheat yields during dry summers...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{variation}} in seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> exists in wheat. It {{has been suggested}} that narrow root angles contribute to adaptation to summer–dominant rainfall zones and wide angles are important in the Mediterranean climates of southern Australia. This hypothesis was tested by measuring root angles in wheat and examining its relationship with yield and root distribution. Root angles of 52 genotypes, defined as the angle subtending the first pair of seminal roots of 14 -day old seedlings, were measured in a root box. Field experiments were conducted in successive years to measure the depth and distribution of roots. The importance of <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> to yield over a wider range of sites was assessed by an analysis of yield variation among the 52 varieties in 12 years of breeding trials. <b>Root</b> <b>angle</b> varied significantly from 56 ° to 113 ° and there was no consistent difference between genotypes from South Australia (mean ± SEM = 82 ± 2. 9 °) and Queensland (82 ± 5. 4 °); genotypes from Western Australia had a slightly wider angle (90 ± 2. 2 °). In the two field trials, maximum depth of rooting did not differ significantly among the genotypes. Narrow <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> was weakly associated with more roots at 60 to 70 cm, but there was no relationship with yield. Within breeding trials, varieties with narrow root angles tended to produce slightly higher (c. 5 %) yields, but this occurred in all states.

30|$|Hammer et al. (2009) {{simulated}} {{the relationship}} of the historical maize yield using data from multiple decades of corn improvement and some field experiments. The authors noted that the median predicted yield at higher densities increased significantly with narrower <b>root</b> <b>angles</b> across a variety of soil types, but only in the growing seasons that were wettest at the time of planting. However, root system architecture was more important for increasing yield at high density than canopy architecture. The gain in performance in the model was related to narrower <b>root</b> <b>angles</b> being associated with deeper root systems that could capitalize on additional water availability for biomass production. Hammer et al. (2009) estimated that modern maize requires about 270  mm more water per season than a century ago, due to the 6  Mg ha− 1 historical increase in maize grain yield. While rooting depth was the critical architectural factor in their simulation, the authors noted that enhanced water extraction capacity could also explain the improvement in performance at higher density. Changes in root architecture, but not biomass partitioning, have been implicated in improved performance of maize for yield under drought stress (Ribaut et al. 2009). There are few studies that directly measure partitioning of root biomass under field conditions, but a synthesis of a variety of studies suggest that, under normal conditions, root biomass is maximized around anthesis, and the ratio of root to stover (shoot) biomass gradually decreases from about 2 : 3 at emergence to 1 : 3 at flowering to 1 : 5 at physiological maturity (Amos and Walters 2006).|$|R
40|$|Sorghum {{is a major}} dryland cereal crop {{in areas}} with low and {{unpredictable}} rainfall, and improvements in root related drought adaptive traits may be advantageous. There is little information available {{about the extent of}} genetic variation in root architecture in sorghum and the potential for manipulating this variation to improve the tolerance of sorghum in water limiting conditions. A lack of simple and efficient root screening methods has hindered the progress. In this study we employ a screening method developed to investigate genetic variation in root architecture, with a particular focus on nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle.</b> A diverse range of sorghum inbred lines and hybrids were studied to explore the extent of genetic variation in this trait and the nature of its genetic control. The encompassing nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> of sorghum inbred lines varied from about 15 º to 50 º. While the heritability for nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> was high, the significant specific combining ability limited predictability of expression in hybrids. Genetic variation among inbred lines and hybrids in nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> was largely distinct from other plant size traits, such as shoot and root mass, and plant leaf area. Variability in these plant size traits in hybrids was associated with the female parent and significant general combining ability. Selected contrasting sorghum genotypes varying in nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> (wide, intermediate and narrow) at the seedling stage were then grown in large root observation chambers. The chambers were watered to field capacity prior to sowing and no further water was added. Although {{there were no significant differences}} among entries in total soil water used or water use efficiency, the genotype SC 170 - 6 - 8 (wide angle) had a tendency of greater proportion of its total water extraction at distance from the plant due to the broader spatial pattern of its root system. Conversely, the genotype B 923296 (narrow angle) had a greater tendency of water extraction from depth immediately below the plant. These findings were consistent with observed differences in root system architecture among the entries. Although further research is needed to more clearly quantify these differences in water extraction capabilities, this finding has implications for seedling nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> as an indicator for specific adaptation in water-limited environments. A genetic linkage map for the RIL population of the cross (B 923296 x SC 170 - 6 - 8) with contrasting nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> was constructed on a subset of lines based on DArT (Diversity Arrays Technology) and SSR markers.

40|$|Background: In sorghum, {{the growth}} angle of nodal roots {{is a major}} {{component}} of root system architecture. It strongly influences the spatial distribution of roots of mature plants in the soil profile, which can impact drought adaptation. However, selection for nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> in sorghum breeding programs has been restricted by the absence of a suitable high throughput phenotyping platform. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a phenotyping platform for the rapid, non-destructive and digital measurement of nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> of sorghum at the seedling stage. Results: The phenotyping platform comprises of 500 soil filled root chambers (50 × 45 × 0. 3 cm in size), made of transparent perspex sheets that were placed in metal tubs and covered with polycarbonate sheets. Around 3 weeks after sowing, once the first flush of nodal roots was visible, roots were imaged in situ using an imaging box that included two digital cameras that were remotely controlled by two android tablets. Free software (openGelPhoto. tcl) allowed precise measurement of nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> from the digital images. The reliability and efficiency of the platform was evaluated by screening a large nested association mapping population of sorghum and a set of hybrids in six independent experimental runs that included up to 500 plants each. The platform revealed extensive genetic variation and high heritability (repeatability) for nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle.</b> High genetic correlations and consistent ranking of genotypes across experimental runs confirmed the reproducibility of the platform. Conclusion: This low cost, high throughput root phenotyping platform requires no sophisticated equipment, is adaptable to most glasshouse environments and is well suited to dissect the genetic control of nodal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> of sorghum. The platform is suitable for use in sorghum breeding programs aiming to improve drought adaptation through root system architecture manipulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only availableIn maize, seminal roots {{develop and}} the primary root system deteriorates as the plant matures. The seminal roots {{comprise}} {{the majority of the}} root system of the adult plant and give the plant stability against lodging. Because seminal roots are the primary means of water uptake in the adult plant, their development under drought conditions is vital. Previous research has suggested that seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and abscisic acid (ABA) level are correlated in maize. Additional research has shown that ABA levels are related to drought tolerance. This study focuses on identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and the number of seminal roots entering the soil from each node. The QTL generated for seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and number per node can then be used to evaluate the relationship with drought tolerance. A set of 94 mapping lines from the intermated B 73 x Mo 17 (IBM) mapping population was used to measure the angle between the seminal root and the stalk. The number of seminal roots entering the soil from the first two nodes was measured as well. Molecular markers evenly distributed throughout the genome were used to run the QTL analysis using QTL Cartographer Version 1. 16. The following QTL analyses were run: seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle,</b> number of roots entering soil from the first node above ground, and number of roots entering soil from the second node. Three QTL were found for seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle,</b> two QTL for the number of roots at the first node above ground, and three QTL for the number of roots at the second node above ground. These QTL positions were then compared to previously known QTL for drought tolerance and root traits. Plant Genomics Internship @ M...|$|E
30|$|From {{the study}} of root {{complexity}} in the Ex-PVP material, there are several relationships of interest for further investigation. Inbreds and hybrids with high FD should perform better under drought conditions, due to more efficient capture of water for a given amount of root biomass. However, if root complexity is highly correlated with root biomass, increased complexity might be disadvantageous due {{to the importance of}} having a high allocation of biomass to the shoot for good performance under drought (Bänziger et al. 2000). Narrow <b>root</b> <b>angles</b> are also expected to be of assistance in water uptake under drought, as the root biomass may be directed deeper into the soil, where more remaining moisture would be available. Narrow <b>root</b> <b>angles</b> may also be advantageous at increased planting densities, where plants compete for lateral soil space. Increased root complexity may be expected to increase the strength of plant anchorage, which could reduce the frequency of lodging. The relationship between root complexity and fertility is more complex, since the most advantageous type of root structure is dependent on the most limiting type of nutrient(s) and local distribution. If root complexity is not predictive of nutrient uptake, the relationship of root structure to grain yield might be more related to the ability to adapt root growth to the environment before flowering. The relationship of root complexity and topology to performance in the context of plant density stress is of great interest, as increased yield at higher plant densities has been a major element of commercial hybrid improvement over time. Below ground, increased planting density increases the proximity of root systems, thereby increasing plant competition for nutrients and water.|$|R

It was confirmed that an improved simulation {{can be obtained by}} using values of the <b>root</b> <b>angles</b> of the antenna booms and by using an angle of the damper plane of motion, relative to the plane of the antennas, which differed from preflight ground measurements...|$|R
50|$|While {{scientists}} have already {{concluded that the}} life cycle span of S. apoda is reliant {{in large part on}} the temperature of its habitat, researchers suggest that the duration of daylight may {{play a key role in}} determining the duration of the S. apoda life cycle as well. The primary root system of S. apoda is fragile. The root hairs are able to live on the roots for months and are mature on the roots prior to the root system penetrating the soil in the early growth stages. The <b>roots,</b> <b>angle</b> meristems, as well as rhizophores of S. apoda experience supplemental growth as the plant itself increases in height. This additional growth occurs in order to ensure the species does not have to transfer water in abundance while still being able to grow across a vast surface plane.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} degree of yield {{advantage}} of skip-row sorghum over solid-planted crops in water-limited situations could be increased if germplasm was identified that more effectively occupied the available soil volume. The aim {{of this research was}} to screen for genetic variation in structure and function of sorghum root systems during early growth, and to assess the functional implications of such variation in terms of rooting effectiveness and occupancy, which represent the rate and amount of water extraction. To achieve this, we grew plants in purpose built rhizotrons. Preliminary experiments, involving four hybrids, indicated that sorghum has only one seminal root, and that the first nodal roots appear at the five-leaf stage. Importantly, genotypic differences in the encompassing angle (relative to the vertical) of nodal roots were observed. Variation in <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> has been associated with architecture of the mature plant root system in wheat. Based on these initial results, a large-scale screening experiment was designed, in which > 70 inbred lines and hybrids, relevant to sorghum breeding in Australia, were grown in small rhizotrons with perspex sheets on both sides. Plants were harvested after the first flush of nodal roots had appeared. <b>Root</b> <b>angle</b> ranged from 15 º to 50 º and because genetically related germplasm had similar <b>root</b> <b>angle,</b> these differences appeared repeatable. A small number of lines have been selected for trials in large chambers to study if these differences in <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> affect the rooting effectiveness and occupancy...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Root rot {{diseases}} {{are a major}} constraint to bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) production around the world. Both snap beans and dry beans are affected. Root rot diseases {{can be caused by}} a variety of pathogens; however, Fusarium solani is a common causal agent. Fusarium root rot is a primary yield limitation of snap bean production in Oregon. Cultural control methods are ineffective and the pathogen will be present {{at the end of one}} season of production on previously clean land, indicating the need for genetic resistance. In order to address this need, a diversity panel of 148 snap bean varieties (the BeanCAP Snap Bean Diversity Panel) was evaluated for resistance to Fusarium root rot in Oregon. Morphological traits potentially involved in root rot resistance were also evaluated. Genome-wide association studies were conducted to locate SNPs associated with Fusarium root rot resistance, aboveground biomass, adventitious roots, taproot diameter, basal root diameter, deepest <b>root</b> <b>angle,</b> shallowest <b>root</b> <b>angle,</b> <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> average, <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> difference, and <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> geometric mean. Significant associations were located for all traits evaluated, including associations with root rot resistance on Pv 02, Pv 08, Pv 09, and Pv 10. Genomic estimated breeding values based on BLUPs and BLUEs were generated for each variety and trait. In order to investigate the genetic architecture of the diversity panel principal component analysis, a kinship heat map, and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree were generated. The first principal component axis separated varieties by center of domestication, while the second principal component axis separated European extra-fine beans from other Mesoamerican varieties. Kinship analysis demonstrated an average similarity coefficient between varieties of 0. 67. The phylogenetic tree indicated two separate derivations of snap beans with extensive subsequent recombination. In this study we also converted previously published SNP markers associated with resistance to root rot diseases in snap bean into user-friendly INDEL and KASP markers to aid in the implementation of marker-assisted selection for resistance to root rot in snap bean...|$|E

40|$|Stay-green” plants retain {{green leaf}} area longer after {{flowering}} than senescent types. This can prolong carbon assimilation during grain filling, increasing yield, particularly under terminal drought stress. A population of doubled haploid wheats (Triticum aestivum L.) {{derived from a}} cross between stay-green SeriM 82 and senescent Hartog was grown in eight environments {{with varying degrees of}} water limitation. The dynamics of normalised difference vegetative index (NDVI) was followed post-flowering to evaluate change in leaf greenness. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for components of stay-green including i) maximum NDVI (Nmax), ii) an indicator of the maximum rate of senescence (SR), iii) thermal time from flowering to commencement of senescence (OnS), iv) thermal time from flowering to mid-senescence (MidS), and v) the integral of NDVI from flowering to 1500 °Cd after flowering (SGint). Genetic regions associated with QTL for stay-green traits were identified (i) in both wet and dry environments on chromosomes 4 A, 4 B, 4 D (constitutive stay-green); (ii) primarily in wetter environments on 2 A and (iii) primarily in dryer environments on 5 B. Other regions associated with QTL for stay-green were identified on 3 B and 7 B in a mixture of environment types. In some environments, stay-green QTL co-located with QTL for seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle,</b> seedling root number and/or for yield. Other stay-green QTL were co-located with yield but not seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and seedling root number. This suggests genetic regions associated with seminal <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> and seedling root number are not solely responsible for the high yielding, stay-green phenotype. Selection for stay-green traits will increase the rate of genetic progress for adaptation of wheat to both well-watered and water-limited environments...|$|E
40|$|Root {{architecture}} {{was determined}} together with shoot parameters under well watered and drought {{conditions in the}} field in three soybean cultivars (A 5409 RG, Jackson and Prima 2000). Morphology parameters were used to classify the cultivars into different root phenotypes that could be important in conferring drought tolerance traits. A 5409 RG is a drought-sensitive cultivar with a shallow root phenotype and a <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> of 60 °. Prima 2000 is an intermediate drought-tolerant cultivar with a <b>root</b> <b>angle</b> of 40 °– 60 °. It has an intermediate root phenotype. Prima 2000 was the best performing cultivar under drought stress, having the greatest shoot biomass and grain yield under limited water availability. It had abundant root nodules even under drought conditions. A positive correlation was observed between nodule size, above-ground biomass and seed yield under well-watered and drought conditions. These findings demonstrate that root system phenotyping using markers that are easy-to-apply under field conditions can be used to determine genotypic differences in drought tolerance in soybean. The strong association between root and nodule parameters and whole plant productivity demonstrates the potential application of simple root phenotypic markers in screening for drought tolerance in soybean...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct a cone-beam {{computed}} tomographic (CBCT) investigation on the root and canal configuration of the mandibular first molars, especially the morphology of the disto-lingual (DL) root, in a Chinese subpopulation. A total of 910 CBCT images of the mandibular first molars were collected from 455 patients who underwent CBCT examinations as a preoperative assessment for implants or orthodontic treatment. The following information was analyzed and evaluated: tooth position, gender, root and root canal number per tooth, root canal type of the mesial root(s) and distal <b>root(s),</b> <b>angle</b> of the DL root canal curvature, distance between two distal canal orifices in the teeth with DL <b>root,</b> and <b>angle</b> of disto-buccal canal orifice-disto-lingual canal orifice-mesio-lingual canal orifice (DB-DL-ML). Most of the mandibular first molars (64. 9 %, n = 591) had two roots with three root canals, and most of the mesial root canals (87. 7 %, n = 798) were type VI. The prevalence of the DL root was 22. 1 % (n = 201). The right side had a higher prevalence of DL root than the left side (p< 0. 05). Additionally, the curvature of the DL root canal were greater in the bucco-lingual (BL) orientation (30. 10 °± 14. 02 °) than in the mesio-distal (MD) orientation (14. 03 °± 8. 56 °) (p< 0. 05). Overall there was a high prevalence of DL root in the mandibular first molars, and most of the DL roots were curved in different degrees.
