First, {{the resultant}} scar often {{is a wide}} patch of tissue that is aesthetically inferior to the scars produced with other nasal-defect correction techniques; however, {{the skin of the}} medial canthus is an exception to such scarring. The second disadvantage to healing by secondary intention is that the contracture of the wound might distort the normal nasal anatomy, which can lead to a pronounced deformity of the alar <b>rim</b> <b>area.</b> For this reason, healing by secondary intention generally is not recommended for defects of the distal third of the nose; nonetheless, the exception is a small wound directly upon the nasal tip.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{are divided}} {{as to whether}} pottery was invented in the Four Corners region or {{introduced}} from the south. Specimens of shallow, unfired clay bowls found at Canyon de Chelly indicate the innovation might have been derived from using clay bowls to parch seeds. Repeated uses rendered these bowls hard and impervious to water, which might represent the first fired pottery in the region. An alternate theory suggests that pottery originated in the Mogollon <b>Rim</b> <b>area</b> to the south, where brown-paste bowls were used {{during the first few}} centuries of the common era. Others believe pottery was introduced to Mesa Verde from Mexico, [...] CE. There is no evidence of ancient pottery markets in the region, but archaeologists believe that local potters exchanged decorative wares between families. Cooking pots made with crushed igneous rock tempers from places like Ute Mountain were more resilient and desirable, and Puebloans from throughout the region traded for them.|$|E

2500|$|The Beethoven Basin (–20°, 124°), partly {{exposed in}} the Michelangelo quadrangle, {{consists}} of one ring 660km in diameter. The exact age of Beethoven is uncertain; {{the density of}} superposed primary impact craters suggests a post-Caloris, late c3 age, {{but it may be}} as old as early c2 age due to the large range of error in the crater age estimate. The ejecta from Beethoven are very extensive east and southeast of the basin rim and are mappable as far as 600km downrange from the rim. However, ejecta appear to be almost absent {{on the west side of}} the basin. The reason for this asymmetry is unclear; possibly Beethoven is the result of an oblique impact that produced an asymmetric ejecta distribution (Gault and Wedekind, 1978), or possibly basin radial texture in the western <b>rim</b> <b>area</b> has been obliterated by ejecta from Valmiki.|$|E
2500|$|Mesoamerica can {{be divided}} into smaller {{linguistic}} subareas wherein linguistic diffusion has been especially intense, or where certain families have extended to become predominant. One such subarea would be the Maya area covering the Yucatán Peninsula, all of Guatemala and Belize, and parts of the states of Chiapas and Tabasco, where Mayan languages have been highly predominant. In Chiapas and on the Guatemalan Pacific coast, speakers of Mixe–Zoquean languages were initially dominant, but with the spread of Mayan languages they were pushed out on the fringes of the areas, or into isolated pockets, and the same was the case for speakers of Xinca and Lenca which were probably also spoken in the area in the preclassic period. Another linguistic area is Oaxaca, which is dominated by speakers of Oto-Manguean languages; here Mixe–Zoque speakers were also gradually displaced by speakers of Zapotecan languages, as well as by speakers of Huave and Tequistlatecan languages. Oaxaca is the most linguistically diverse area of Mesoamerica and its [...] contain at least 100 mutually unintelligible linguistic variants. The subarea commonly called Central Mexico, covering valleys and mountainous areas surrounding the Valley of Mexico, originally contained mostly northern Oto-Manguean (Oto-Pamean) languages; however, beginning in the late classic these languages were gradually displaced by Nahuatl, which is now the predominant indigenous language of the area. The Western area was inhabited mostly by speakers of Purépecha and some Uto-Aztecan languages such as Huichol and Nahuatl. The Northern <b>Rim</b> <b>area</b> has been inhabited by semi-nomadic speakers of Uto-Aztecan languages (the Tepiman and Cora-Huichol groups) as well as Pamean (Oto-Mangue), and other languages that are now extinct. The Gulf area is traditionally the home of speakers of Totonacan languages in the northern and central area and Mixe–Zoque in the southern area. However, the northern gulf area became home to the speakers of Huastec in the preclassic period, and the southern area fell under Nahuan dominance in the post-classic period. The Central American area was originally inhabited by speakers of Misumalpan, Jicaquean and Chibchan languages which became subject to dominance and linguistic influence by Maya speaking groups in the classic period. Guerrero does not really constitute its own linguistic area; however, it has been influenced from the Oaxacan, Western or central Mexican area at different times of its history.|$|E

40|$|Glaucoma is {{a disease}} in which the intraocular {{pressure}} is very high, causing the optic disc to become cupped with eventual everlasting impairment of vision. It is the second leading cause of permanent blindness. It cannot be cured, but its progression can be slowed down by treatment in early stage. Therefore, detecting glaucoma in time is crucial. In this paper glaucoma is classified by extracting two features using retinal fundus images. (i) Cup to Disc Ratio (CDR). (ii) Ratio of Neuroretinal Rim in inferior, superior, temporal and nasal quadrants {{that is to say}} ISNT quadrants. Glaucoma frequently damages superior and inferior fibers before temporal and nasal optic nerve fibers and which start decreasing the superior and inferior <b>rims</b> <b>areas</b> and change the order of ISNT rule. Hence, the detection of <b>rim</b> <b>areas</b> in four directions can assist the correct verification of ISNT rule and then improve the correct diagnosis of glaucoma at early stages. In the end, feed forward back propagation neural network is used for classification based on the above two features. The tool used to accomplish the objective is MATLAB R 2013 a. The average accuracy of the system is around 96 %. The method does not rely on trained glaucoma specialists or specialized and costly OCT/HRT machines. Several fundus retinal images containing normal and glaucoma were applied to the proposed method for demonstration...|$|R

40|$|Here {{we report}} the {{occurrence}} of garnet porphyroblasts that have overgrown alternating silica-saturated and silica deficient microdomains via different mineral reactions. The samples were collected from ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) metapelites in the Highland Complex, Sri Lanka. In some of the metapelites, garnet crystals have cores formed via a dehydration reaction, which had taken place at silica-saturated microdomains and mantle to <b>rim</b> <b>areas</b> formed via a dehydration reaction at silica-deficient microdomains. In contrast, some other garnets in the same rock cores had formed via a dehydration reaction which occurred at silica-deficient microdomains while mantle to <b>rim</b> <b>areas</b> formed via a dehydration reaction at silica-saturated microdomains. Based on the textural observations, we conclude that the studied garnets have grown across different effective bulk compositional microdomains during the prograde evolution. These microdomains could represent heterogeneous compositional layers (paleobedding/laminations) in the precursor sediments or differentiated crenulation cleavages that existed during prograde metamorphism. UHT metamorphism associated with strong ductile deformation, metamorphic differentiation and crystallization of locally produced melt may have obliterated the evidence for such microdomains in the matrix. The lack of significant compositional zoning in garnet probably due to self-diffusion during UHT metamorphism had left mineral inclusions as the sole evidence for earlier microdomains with contrasting chemistry.

The differing diagenetic histories between buried and outcrop chalk result in different rock properties, which are of great importance when simulating reservoir conditions using outcrop chalks as models. In general, deeply buried reservoir chalks show significant overgrowth as witnessed by reshaping of particles together with strengthening of particle contacts. Most outcrop chalks are moderately affected with looser interparticle connections and less altered particle shapes. The non-carbonate mineralogy of outcrop chalks is dominated by quartz, occasionally opal-CT and clinoptilolite, and the clay mineral smectite. In offshore chalks quartz still dominates; opal-CT has recrystallized into submicron-size quartz crystals, and smectite {{has been replaced by}} kaolinite.

A CFD code based on an unstructured grid is used to solve detailed flow feature in the cavity seal which has a complex geometry. The numerical results confirm various observations from earlier experimental studies under similar flow conditions. When the flow rate through the rim cavity seal is increased, the ingestion of the main turbine flow into the <b>rim</b> seal <b>area</b> decreases drastically.
