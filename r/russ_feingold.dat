25|$|Jews as an {{important}} Democratic constituency are especially politically active and influential in large cities such as New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago; and play critical roles in large cities within presidential swing states, such as Philadelphia, Miami, and Las Vegas. Many prominent national Democrats in recent decades have been Jewish, including Chuck Schumer, Carl Levin, Abraham Ribicoff, Ben Cardin, Henry Waxman, Martin Frost, Joseph Lieberman, Bernie Sanders, Dianne Feinstein, Barney Frank, Barbara Boxer, Paul Wellstone, Rahm Emanuel, <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold,</b> Herb Kohl, and Howard Metzenbaum.|$|E
25|$|William Proxmire, a Democratic Senator (1957–89), {{dominated}} the Democratic party for years; he {{was best known}} for attacking waste and fraud in federal spending.

25|$|The {{race for}} the 2008 presidential {{nomination}} began in earnest after the 2006 midterm elections. Between November 2006 and February 2007, eight major candidates opened their campaigns-Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd, John Edwards, Dennis Kucinich, Barack Obama, Bill Richardson, and Tom Vilsack-joining Mike Gravel, who had announced his candidacy in April 2006. Potential candidates John Kerry, Al Gore, <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold,</b> Evan Bayh, Tom Daschle, Wesley Clark, Mark Warner, and Al Sharpton reportedly considered running but ultimately declined to seek the nomination. Vilsack dropped out in February 2007.|$|E
25|$|Many Democrats {{are opposed}} to the Patriot Act, however when the law was passed most Democrats were {{supportive}} of it and all but two Democrats in the U.S. Senate voted for the original Patriot Act legislation in 2001. The lone nay vote was from <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold</b> of Wisconsin; Mary Landrieu of Louisiana did not vote. In the House the Democrats voted for the Act by 145 yea and 62 nay.

25|$|During {{the period}} of the Civil War, Wisconsin was a Republican state; in fact it is the state that gave birth to the Republican Party, {{although}} ethno-religious issues in the late 19th century caused a brief split in the Republican coalition. Through {{the first half of the}} 20th century, Wisconsin's politics were dominated by Robert La Follette and his sons, originally of the Republican Party, but later of the revived Progressive Party. Since 1945, the state has maintained a close balance between Republicans and Democrats. Republican Senator Joe McCarthy was a controversial national figure in the early 1950s. Recent leading Republicans include former Governor Tommy Thompson and Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner; prominent Democrats include Senators Herb Kohl and <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold,</b> and Congressman David Obey.|$|E

Ricketts also donated to the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committeebenefiting both state parties and the Clinton campaign.|$|R
2500|$|Regarding {{civil liberties}} during the Obama presidency, he {{elaborated}} on {{his conception of}} change when he said, [...] "I think {{the only means of}} true political change will come from people working outside of that [...] system to undermine it, and subvert it, and weaken it, and destroy it; not try to work within it to change it." [...] He did, however, raise money for <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold's</b> 2010 Senate re-election bid, Bill Halter's 2010 primary challenge to Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln, as well as several Congressional candidates in 2012 described as [...] "unique".|$|R
25|$|The Democratic Party {{supports}} {{the death penalty}} {{far less than the}} Republican Party. Though most Democrats in Congress have never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used federal death penalty, both <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold</b> and Dennis Kucinich have introduced such bills with little success. Democrats have led efforts to overturn state death penalty laws, particularly in New Jersey and in New Mexico. They have also sought to prevent reinstatement of the death penalty in those states which prohibit it, including Massachusetts and New York. During the Clinton administration, Democrats led the expansion of the federal death penalty. These efforts resulted in the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, signed into law by President Clinton; the law heavily limited appeals in death penalty cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{first version}} of the Patriot Act was {{introduced}} into the House on October 2, 2001 as the Provide Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (PATRIOT) Act of 2001, and was later passed by the House as the Uniting and Strengthening America (USA) Act (H.R. 2975) on October 12. This {{was based on the}} afore-mentioned Anti-Terrorism Act, but had been changed after negotiations and work between Attorney General Ashcroft, Senators Leahy, Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), Bob Graham, Trent Lott (R-MS) and Orrin Hatch. It was introduced into the Senate as the USA Act of 2001 (S. 1510) by Tom Daschle (D-SD) where Senator <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold</b> (D-WI) proposed a number of amendments, none of which were passed. Feingold amended the provision relating to interception of computer trespasser communications, limited the roving wiretap authority under FISA and modified the provisions relating to access to business records under FISA. The USA Act was later vitiated and indefinitely postponed, because the Senate and House bills could not be reconciled in time.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Specter co-sponsored the Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2007 with Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold</b> (D-Wis.). But {{the bill}} {{failed in the}} 110th Congress, and Specter again co-sponsored the measure in the 2009 111th Congress. In December 2008, Specter was {{involved}} in a controversy as a result of telling [...] "Polish jokes" [...] at New York's Rainbow Room while speaking {{at the annual meeting of}} the Commonwealth Club.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{controversy}} over the effects of the Seventeenth Amendment, advocates have emerged to reform or repeal [...] the amendment. Under President Barack Obama's administration in 2009, four sitting Democratic senators left the Senate for appointed executive branch positions: Barack Obama (President), Joe Biden (Vice President), Hillary Clinton (Secretary of State), and Ken Salazar (Secretary of the Interior). Controversies developed about the successor appointments made by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and New York Governor David Paterson. New interest was aroused in abolishing the provision for the Senate appointment by the governor. Accordingly, Senator <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold</b> of Wisconsin and Representative David Dreier of California proposed an amendment to remove this power; Senators John McCain and Dick Durbin became co-sponsors, as did Representative John Conyers.|$|E
500|$|The Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 (ZDERA) {{went into}} effect in 2002, {{creating}} a credit freeze of the Zimbabwean government through Section 4 C, Multilateral Financing Restriction. The bill was sponsored by Bill Frist, and co-sponsored by senators Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold</b> and Jesse Helms. [...] Through ZDERA Section 4C, the Secretary of the Treasury is ordered to direct US Directors at the International Financial Institutions listed in Section 3, [...] "to oppose and vote against-- (1) any extension by the respective institution of any loan, credit, or guarantee to the Government of Zimbabwe; or (2) any cancellation or reduction of indebtedness owed by the Government of Zimbabwe to the United States or any international financial institution." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain {{attacked}} {{what he saw}} as the corrupting {{influence of}} large political contributions– from corporations, labor unions, other organizations, and wealthy individuals– and he made this his signature issue. Starting in 1994, he worked with Democratic Wisconsin Senator <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold</b> on campaign finance reform; their McCain–Feingold bill attempted to put limits on [...] "soft money". The efforts of McCain and Feingold were opposed by some of the moneyed interests targeted, by incumbents in both parties, by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well, and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as media bias. Despite sympathetic coverage in the media, initial versions of the McCain–Feingold Act were filibustered and never came to a vote.|$|E
500|$|Starting in late 1994 {{he worked}} with Democratic Wisconsin Senator <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold</b> on {{campaign}} finance reform; their McCain-Feingold bill would attempt to put limits on [...] "soft money", funds that corporations, unions, and other organizations could donate to political parties, which would then be funneled to political candidates in circumvention of [...] "hard money" [...] donation limits. [...] From the start, McCain and Feingold's efforts were opposed {{by some of the}} interests targeted, by incumbents in both parties, by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech, and by those who wanted to lessen the power of what they saw as media bias. [...] On the other hand, it garnered considerable sympathetic coverage in the national media, and from 1995 on, [...] "maverick Republican" [...] became a label frequently applied to McCain in stories. [...] He has used the term himself, and one of the chapters in his 2002 memoir Worth the Fighting For would be titled [...] "Maverick". [...] The first version of the McCain-Feingold Act was introduced into the Senate in September 1995; it was filibustered in 1996 and never came to a vote.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, McCain {{shared the}} Profile in Courage Award with Senator <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold</b> {{for their work}} towards {{campaign}} finance reform. [...] The following year, the same pair shared the Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government. In 2005, The Eisenhower Institute awarded McCain the Eisenhower Leadership Prize. The prize recognizes individuals whose lifetime accomplishments reflect Dwight D. Eisenhower's legacy of integrity and leadership. In 2006, the Bruce F. Vento Public Service Award was bestowed upon McCain by the National Park Trust. The same year, McCain was awarded the Henry M. Jackson Distinguished Service Award by the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, in honor of Senator Henry M. [...] "Scoop" [...] Jackson. In 2007, the World Leadership Forum presented McCain with the Policymaker of the Year Award; it is given internationally {{to someone who has}} [...] "created, inspired or strongly influenced important policy or legislation".

In 2015, the Kiev Patriarchate awarded McCain its own version of the Order of St. Vladimir. In 2016, Allegheny College awarded McCain, along with Vice President Joe Biden, its Prize for Civility in Public Life. In August 2016, Petro Poroshenko, the President of Ukraine, awarded McCain with the highest award for foreigners, the Order of Liberty. In April 14, 2017, Hashim Thaçi, the President of Kosovo, awarded McCain with the medal [...] "Urdhër i Lirisë" [...] (Order of Freedom) for his contribution to the freedom and independence of Kosovo, and its partnership with the US. In October 2017, he received the Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center.|$|E

2500|$|Opponents of the Act {{have been}} quite vocal in asserting that it was passed opportunistically after the September 11 attacks, believing that {{there would have been}} little debate. They view the Act as one that was hurried through the Senate with little change before it was passed. (Senators Patrick Leahy and <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold</b> {{proposed}} amendments to modify the final revision.) ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{advocate}} of government restrictions on campaign spending and contributions, McCain made {{campaign finance reform}} a central issue in his 2000 presidential bid. With Democratic Sen. <b>Russ</b> <b>Feingold</b> of Wisconsin he pushed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 which banned unlimited donations to national political parties (soft money) and curtailed issue-advocacy ads. Because of McCain and Feingold's involvement, the law is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "McCain-Feingold Act." ...|$|E
2500|$|The White House {{released}} a statement in December 2009, to The Advocate, stating that US President Barack Obama [...] "strongly opposes efforts, such as the draft law pending in Uganda, that would criminalize homosexuality and move against the tide of history".
