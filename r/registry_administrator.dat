50|$|At first, CZ.NIC had {{fulfilled}} {{the role of}} both <b>registry</b> <b>administrator</b> and the registrar. A fundamental change in this respect occurred in 2002, {{when there was a}} transition to more efficient decentralized domain administration. Thanks to this transition, other entities could enter the domain registration process. The aim of this measure was to separate the technical aspects of the operation of the registration system from the operation by domain names’ end holders and to introduce competitive environment, which would bring better services and lower prices, into the registration process. The decentralized domain administration system started its operation in autumn of 2003 and was immediately entered by first commercial registrars. Apart from commercial environment and price decrease, the decentralized system has brought other intriguing changes. The users have been enabled to register domains for a period longer than one year (up to 10 years), and the system have been further secured, in particular with respect to domain holder’s rights. Due to the decentralization and making domains accessible to public, domain disputes have become a frequent occurrence. That is why the association introduced an arbitration clause into the Registration Rules in 2004. This clause allows for resolving disputes through Arbitration Court attached to the Chamber of Commerce and the Agricultural Chamber of the Czech Republic. The registration now includes accepting the commitment to respect the decisions of the Arbitration Court, which has simplified and accelerated the dispute resolution.|$|E
40|$|In the Integrated Product Policy Communication of 2003, the European Commission {{recognised}} Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as “the best {{framework for}} assessing the potential environmental impacts of products”. Since then, life cycle approaches were further strengthened in EU policies through the Sustainable Production and Consumption / Sustainable Industry Policy Action Plan Communications that encompasses various policies (e. g. Eco-design for Energy-related Products Directive, Footprint initiative, etc.). Within this context there is an urgent “need to improve data availability and quality worldwide by internationally cooperating on LCA data and methods”. To address this situation and to foster standardization, the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Data Network has been developed by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (DG JRC). The ILCD Data Network (ILCD DN) aims at providing consistent and quality-assured LCI data through the web, with easy access via searches, filtering, and sorting. The data sets in the network can come from any data developer/owner, e. g. industry, national LCA projects, research groups, and consultants. The data {{will be published by}} the developer/owner under its own conditions, e. g. for free, for fee, via registration, etc. The ILCD DN will comprise LCA data from different databases increasing data sharing but raising a consistency problem. While, within specific databases, quality are ensured due to the development of modelling principle, across databases there can exist significant differences. This includes modelling approaches (e. g. system boundaries definition), allocation approaches and nomenclature of flows denoted in the inventories. Bridging these differences to ensure the efficient exchange of data is one of the ever challenges in the field of LCA. Moreover, some current research activities are aiming to broaden LCA application perspective from the geographical perspective. This will have a great influence on the LCA data aspect and will increase the need for well documented datasets. The ILCD Entry-level Requirements have been developed in order to set minimum quality requirements for datasets registered to the ILCD DN. This level of requirements has been put in place to quickly increase the access to properly documented LCI data sets. These requirements together {{with the use of the}} ILCD data format and related tools will allow the practitioner to work with a common set of elementary flows, LCIA methods, etc. At the same time the data sets are identified according to the quality-level they adhere to. It is important to highlight that all data in the network have to be in line with ISO 14040 and 14044, that is part of the entry-level requirements. ILCD DN IT feature will allow managing LCI datasets subscription and selection, only ILCD Entry-level compliant datasets will be registered to the Network. This will guarantee to the LCA practitioners to find only high quality and well documented data enabling selection of coherent and appropriate data for their study. After detailing this justification of the ILCD D N, this paper will describe the ILCD DN features, the role of contributors (e. g. node administrator, <b>registry</b> <b>administrator,</b> visitors) and will illustrate its application for the management of LCA data networks. The benefits of using such a tool by LCA regional networks will be highlighted. Finally, this paper will summarise the current development stage of the ILCD DN. JRC.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a software environment recently implemented for maintaining a registry of unique short names {{for each of}} the entity data types within each of the Express schemas in the ISO TC 184 /SC 4 standards. The new environment replaces an inefficient application and has already provided time savings for both the <b>registry's</b> <b>administrator</b> and editors of SC 4 standards. It is also improving the quality of SC 4 standards. The new SC 4 Short Names Registry resides on a server at NIST and uses an SQL database engine in conjunction with the NIST Express Toolkit. Two applications have been developed for accessing the Short Names Registry. An application for end users that is accessible using the World Wide Web allows individuals to view SC 4 part summary information and entity long names and short names in a variety of useful formats. An application for database administrators supports the insertion, deletion, and modification of SC 4 parts. Keywords : CGI; World Wide Web; STEP; TC 184 /SC 4; [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background Information {{management}} systems {{are essential to}} capture data be it for public health and human disease, sustainable agriculture, or plant and animal biosecurity. In public health, the term patient registry {{is often used to}} describe information {{management systems}} that are used to record and track phenotypic data of patients. Appropriate design, implementation and deployment of patient registries enables rapid decision making and ongoing data mining ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes. A major bottleneck encountered is the static nature of these registries. That is, software developers are required to work with stakeholders to determine requirements, design the system, implement the required data fields and functionality for each patient registry. Additionally, software developer time is required for ongoing maintenance and customisation. It is desirable to deploy a sophisticated registry framework that can allow scientists and registry curators possessing standard computing skills to dynamically construct a complete patient registry from scratch and customise it for their specific needs with little or no need to engage a software developer at any stage. Results This paper introduces our second generation open source registry framework which builds on our previous rare disease registry framework (RDRF). This second generation RDRF is a new approach as it empowers <b>registry</b> <b>administrators</b> to construct one or more patient registries without software developer effort. New data elements for a diverse range of phenotypic and genotypic measurements can be defined at any time. Defined data elements can then be utilised in any of the created registries. Fine grained, multi-level user and workgroup access can be applied to each data element to ensure appropriate access and data privacy. We introduce the concept of derived data elements to assist the data element standards communities on how they might be best categorised. Conclusions We introduce the second generation RDRF that enables the user-driven dynamic creation of patient registries. We believe this second generation RDRF is a novel approach to patient registry design, implementation and deployment and a significant advance on existing registry systems...|$|R

The American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) offers a board certification in Nursing Informatics. [...] For Radiology Informatics, the CIIP (Certified Imaging Informatics Professional) certification was created by ABII (The American Board of Imaging Informatics) which was founded by SIIM (the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine) and ARRT (the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists) in 2005. The CIIP certification requires documented experience working in Imaging Informatics, formal testing and is a limited time credential requiring renewal every five years. The exam tests for a combination of IT technical knowledge, clinical understanding, and project management experience thought to represent the typical workload of a PACS administrator or other radiology IT clinical support role. [...] Certifications from PARCA (PACS <b>Administrators</b> <b>Registry</b> and Certifications Association) are also recognized. The five PARCA certifications are tiered from entry level to architect level. The American Health Information Management Association offers credentials in medical coding, analytics, and data administration, such as Registered Health Information Administrator and Certified Coding Associate.|$|R
40|$|When the United States {{implemented}} {{civilian and}} military smallpox vaccination programs in 2003, the National Smallpox Vaccine in Pregnancy Registry was established to better evaluate outcomes after the inadvertent vaccination of pregnant women. Women were referred to the <b>registry</b> by vaccine <b>administrators,</b> health care providers, or state health departments or through self-referral. Registry professionals actively follow up with all enrolled women and collect data on pregnancy, birth, and infant health outcomes. As of September 2006, pregnancy outcome data were available from 376 women. Most (77 %) were vaccinated near the time of conception, before results of a standard pregnancy test would have been positive. To date, outcome evaluations have not revealed higher-than-expected rates of pregnancy loss (11. 9 %), preterm birth (10. 7 %), or birth defects (2. 8 %), compared with those in healthy referent populations. No cases of fetal vaccinia have been identified. The Smallpox Vaccine in Pregnancy Registry continues to actively enroll women and follow infant and early-childhood health outcomes. In response to concerns about potential biological weapons use worldwide, the United States initiated a national smallpox vaccination program in early 2003 [1]. The vaccine approved for this effort was first use...|$|R
