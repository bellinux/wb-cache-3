40|$|A blind <b>rivet</b> <b>nut</b> is a {{mechanical}} fastener enabling a fast installation from one side. The setting process relies on plastic deformation due to axial compression of the <b>rivet</b> <b>nut</b> {{in such a}} way that a bulge is formed on the underside of the work piece. The mechanical performance of such a connection partly depends on the final geometry of the <b>rivet</b> <b>nut</b> after forming. In this contribution, the torque-to-turn resistance of an internally threaded round tubular rivet is studied with the aid of finite element techniques. A strategy is presented to simulate the setting process involving large plastic strains and contact pressures. An FE-based inverse method was used to identify the local plastic material properties of the blind <b>rivet</b> <b>nut.</b> The forming simulation was validated in terms of predicted shape of the <b>rivet</b> <b>nut</b> and the evolution of the setting force. A quasi-static FE model using the shape and solution variables of the deformed <b>rivet</b> <b>nut</b> was used to reproduce the torque-to-turn resistance as a function of the setting force. Finally, the aim is to apply the presented modelling strategy to explore innovative possibilities to increase the torque-to-turn resistance of a blind <b>rivet</b> <b>nut.</b> status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Development and {{application}} of composite materials in modern industry are very dynamic. Composite materials seem to be replacing steel and aluminium ones. Composites are a cheaper solution, with similar mechanical strengths. Generally, {{there are two types}} of joints in composite structures: mechanical and adhesively bonded ones. The aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of riveted joints in composites materials. Static tensile test method was used. In the test there was used one type of glass fabric (Interglas 92140) from which two types of composite samples were prepared. In each sample there was used the same type of fiber with the same fiber orientation – 3 layers. Samples had dimensions of 220 x 100 mm and thickness of approximately 1. 5 mm. They were connected to each other with aluminium <b>rivet</b> <b>nuts</b> (from 1 to 3) and placed in a metal frame with a screw connection which was made of screws with nominal thread pitch M 5. Screws were tightened with constant torque. It was to provide an axial force to the sample during the tensile test. The frame was placed between cross-bars of tensile machine INSTRON 8516. The samples were stretched at a speed of 0. 05 mm/s at a distance up to 20 mm. During the tensile test displacement of the samples and pull force were registered.

40|$|The steel {{thin-walled}} {{structures are}} widespread in civil and industrial engineering nowadays. Self-drilling screws or rivets {{are used to}} interconnect thin-walled elements. Blind <b>rivets</b> and <b>nuts</b> as connectors are considered in the frames of this paper. Rivets have some benefits over self-drilling screws. They are: we can obtain more dense connection when using rivets. So we can increase bearing capacity of connection; a lower cost of riveted connection; a large variety of installation tools for riveted connection: manual, pneumatic, battery; side; an easy installation: access to the connected element is required only from one. These benefits provide increasingly growling popularity to rivets. In the paper 4 types of rivets are considered: combined (aluminum/steel) blind rivets, zinc-coated steel blind rivets, stainless steel blind <b>rivets</b> and blind <b>nuts.</b> The features of each type of rivets are described in the paper. The influence on the behaviour of connections is revealed. The results of experimental research performed by the authors are presented in the paper. A bearing capacity shear of riveted connections is studied in the experiment. There are 3 types of riveted connections subjected to experiment: connection made by blind combined rivets; connection made by zinc-coated steel blind rivets; connection made by blind nuts. A connection between elements with significantly different thicknesses is modeled in the experiment. In reality this situation takes place, for example, in the roofing of buildings, where trapezoidal sheet can be fastened to purlin by rivets. As {{a result of the}} experiment the authors found out that the local deformations occuring under rivet head in the thick element significantly affect the behaviour and bearing capacity of the connection. That’s why the results of connection's bearing capacity obtained in tests were lower than the bearing capacity of rivet declared by manufacturers...|$|R

40|$|Carbon Fibre Composite (CFC) and {{titanium}} (Ti) alloys {{have been}} widely employed in the aerospace industry due to their high strength to weight ratios. For making a military aircraft body, these materials are usually stacked together with titanium alloys serving as the airframe, while CFC is the outer skin. Drilling is often performed in one shot from the CFC outer skin through to the titanium alloy airframe {{for the purpose of}} assembling them by mechanical means using <b>rivets,</b> screws, <b>nuts</b> and bolts. Conventional drilling of these CFC/Ti stacks, however, often results in two major issues; rapid tool failure and poor hole quality. This paper considers the potential of employing Ultrasonic Assisted Drilling (UAD) on stack materials in order to improve tool life and hole quality. Experiments comparing conventional drilling and UAD on CFC/Ti 6 Al 4 V stack using reground 6. 121 mm-diameter TiAlN coated tungsten carbide twist drills are presented. Reground drills were used by way of replicating typical current practice in industry. A constant cutting speed and feed rate of 50 m/min and 0. 05 mm/rev, respectively was used in both experiments. During UAD experiments, ultrasonic amplitude and frequency was fixed at 2. 6 µm and 42. 7 kHz, respectively. A total of 100 holes were drilled in the stacks during each drilling processes (conventional drilling and UAD). Machinability was assessed in terms of thrust forces, tool wear, hole diameter, CFC delamination and titanium burr. Thrust forces were measured using a dynamometer; tool wear was examined using an optical microscope and a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM); and holes diameter were measured using a bore micrometer. Hole defects; CFC entry delamination was examined and quantified using an optical microscope, while titanium exit burr were investigated using both an optical microscope and a depth gauge. The dominant types of tool wear during drilling of CFC/Ti 6 Al 4 V stacks were caused by titanium adhesion/fusion on the cutting edges. In addition, abrasive wear caused by abrading carbon fibres against cutting edges were also observed. Poor hole quality of the stacks included inconsistent diameter of CFC and titanium holes; CFC delamination at the hole entrance and burr formation as the drill exited the titanium. The difference in thrust forces produced by conventional drilling and UAD were minor. It was observed that UAD resulted in less tool wear rate and a reduction of adhered titanium alloy on the cutting edges, more consistent hole diameters and less titanium burr compared to conventional drilling. However, larger CFC delamination was observed during UAD than conventional drilling...|$|R

40|$|At {{present the}} {{automotive}} industry is due to an EU directive, replacing hexavalent chrome on vehicles. This is an extensive job as hexavalent chrome is used all over the vehicle and to large extent on fasteners (screws, <b>nuts,</b> <b>rivets</b> etc.). Chrome (VI) {{is used as a}} passivating layer on mainly zinc-iron. When replacing the hexavalent chrome with a chrome (VI) free product, the passivating properties are reduced. One of the alternatives is to replace the zinc-iron coating with a zinc-nickel coating. This coating shows great promise from the corrosion resistance point of view. Zinc-nickel is a cathodically protecting coating, and will in principle dissolve to protect the substrate from corrosion. It is therefore important to understand how, and at what rates nickel is released from zinc-nickel coatings when exposed to a chloride-rich automotive environment. The potential environmental impact of nickel needs to be evaluated before Scania can introduce this alternative as corrosion protection. Tests by Scania have previously shown that contact allergy is not an issue for zinc-nickel coatings with Cr (III) passivation. Nickel release rates corresponding to 0, 12 mg m- 2 yr- 1 for zinc- 15 % nickel coatings at a pH of 4, 2 were determined from an accelerated corrosion test. Based on these values, less than 1 kg of nickel per year would be released from the Scania rolling stock if Scania were to introduce zinc-nickel coatings preferably on fasteners. This value is low compared to other sources of nickel release. In order to evaluate the toxicity of the released nickel, information about the chemical speciation, i. e. chemical forms, is needed. Total or dissolved metal are not good predictors of ecotoxicity of metals. Chemical speciation and bioavailability must be incorporated in toxicity testing. Total or dissolved metal may be used as a worst case approximation...|$|R
