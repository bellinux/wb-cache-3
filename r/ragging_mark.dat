40|$|Traces of minimalism-conceptualism's {{redefinition}} {{of the work}} of art as analytical proposition converge in Andrew Leslie's recent works, which are best described as hybrid painting-objects. Each is comprised of a bundle of narrow, factory-made lengths of aluminium. Only when installed as a rectangle of closely spaced, vertical units on the (gallery) wall do they become a 'painting', highlighting the interconnected role of architecture and conventions of media as agents of artistic definition. The back of each set of lengths is painted with a single, yellow word on a blue ground. The slightly v-shaped, front face of each length is left plain. An observant viewer, however, will notice that some painting has taken place since Leslie isn't concerned to mask the thin edges of the aluminium units to keep them free of paint. The <b>ragged</b> <b>marks</b> left by the painting process signal that each work is a pictorial object not a readymade, much as Daniel Buren [...] -an artist of significance for Leslie [...] -consistently painted the outer bands of the striped fabric he used in his extended cycle of works exploring how the readymade had affected the possibilities for painting...|$|R
5000|$|On December 24, 2009, Joseph Bruce {{revealed}} {{through his}} Twitter account that Gang Rags would {{be produced by}} Mike E. Clark. In April, Bruce {{announced that he would}} join Clark in producing the album, marking {{the first time that the}} two would collaborate on an album by Blaze. Gang <b>Rags</b> also <b>marked</b> the first time that the members of hip hop group Twiztid, Jamie Spaniolo and Paul Methric, did not provide any production on a Blaze album. Bruce and Clark helped Blaze develop new vocal styles, utilizing different voices and rhyme styles. Clark notes that they [...] "tried to do a lot of different stuff on this record." [...] Bruce adds that the album is [...] "still very much Blaze, but ... the sounds and concepts around him have changed." ...|$|R
60|$|The frieze now {{was more}} {{grotesque}} than ever, but had changed suddenly to an equestrian one, sharply outlined against the deep-blue Egyptian sky. Those {{who have never}} ridden before have to ride in Egypt, and when the donkeys break into a canter, and the Nile Irregulars are at full charge, such a scene of flying veils, clutching hands, huddled swaying figures, and anxious faces {{is nowhere to be}} seen. Belmont, his square figure balanced upon a small white donkey, was waving his hat to his wife, who had come out upon the saloon-deck of the Korosko. Cochrane sat very erect with a stiff military seat, hands low, head high, and heels down, while beside him rode the young Oxford man, looking about him with drooping eyelids as if he thought the desert hardly respectable, and had his doubts about the Universe. Behind them the whole party was strung along the bank in varying stages of jolting and discomfort, a brown-faced, noisy donkey-boy running after each donkey. Looking back, they could see the little lead-coloured stern-wheeler, with the gleam of Mrs. Belmont's handkerchief from the deck. Beyond ran the broad, brown river, winding down in long curves to where, five miles off, the square, white block-houses upon the black, <b>ragged</b> hills <b>marked</b> the outskirts of Wady Haifa, which had been their starting-point that morning.|$|R
50|$|There are short, white {{pubescent}} hairs sporadically distributed {{along the}} lateral and posterior {{aspects of the}} mesosoma. They are more densely arranged along the upper surface of the prothorax. Hairs on the mesoscutum are short and infrequent. The hairs on the scutellum are longer and stiffer. Deep, <b>ragged</b> puncture <b>marks</b> are spaced closely together across the mesoscutum. The spaces between each punctate marking are less than the diameters of the marks. They are less closely associated on the scutellem. At the axilla, the markings are less ragged in appearance and are spaced very close together. The pleural surfaces are shiny, with puncture marks along the lower aspects being deep and ragged. Higher up, these markings are less ragged and less sparsely distributed. The lateral aspects of the propodeum are generally of a smoother texture, although there are crisp and shallow markings closely spaced. The spine along the anterior coxal aspect is nearly obliterated. The coxa are covered in dense white hairs. The anterior tarsus is dark. There are long brown hairs on the fronts {{of the first three}} tarsomeres. The more typical fringe of hairs along the posterior aspect is absent. There is a robust mid-tibial spur. The slim middle and posterior tarsi show yellow spurs. There are tiny puncture marks closely spaced together on the tegula. The black veined wings are slightly cloudy at the apices and glassier at the bases.|$|R

60|$|The {{landscape}} was changed materially for the better; though the hand, which had impressed {{so much of}} the desert on the surrounding region, had laid a portion of its power on this spot. The appearance of vegetation was, however, less discouraging than in the more sterile wastes of the rolling prairies. Clusters of trees were scattered in greater profusion, and a long outline of <b>ragged</b> forest <b>marked</b> the northern boundary of the view. Here and there, on the bottom, were to be seen the evidences of a hasty and imperfect culture of such indigenous vegetables as were of a quick growth, and which were known to flourish, without the aid of art, in deep and alluvial soils. On the very edge {{of what might be called}} the table-land, were pitched the hundred lodges of a horde of wandering Siouxes. Their light tenements were arranged without the least attention to order. Proximity to the water seemed to be the only consideration which had been consulted in their disposition, nor had even this important convenience been always regarded. While most of the lodges stood along the brow of the plain, many were to be seen at greater distances, occupying such places as had first pleased the capricious eyes of their untutored owners. The encampment was not military, nor in the slightest degree protected from surprise by its position or defences. It was open on every side, and on every side as accessible as any other point in those wastes, if the imperfect and natural obstruction offered by the river be excepted. In short, the place bore the appearance of having been tenanted longer than its occupants had originally intended, while it was not wanting in the signs of readiness for a hasty, or even a compelled departure.|$|R
40|$|The RAG {{recombinase}} is a domesticated {{transposable element}} co-opted in jawed vertebrates {{to drive the}} process of the so-called V(D) J recombination, which is the hallmark of the adaptive immune system to produce antigen receptors. RAG targets, namely, the Recombination Signal Sequences (RSS), are rather long and degenerated sequences, which highlights the ability of the recombinase to interact {{with a wide range of}} target sequences, including outside of antigen receptor loci. The recognition of such cryptic targets by the recombinase threatens genome integrity by promoting aberrant DNA recombination, as observed in lymphoid malignancies. Genomes evolution resulting from RAG acquisition is an ongoing discussion, in particular regarding the counter-selection of sequences resembling the RSS and the modifications of epigenetic regulation at these potential cryptic sites. Here, we describe a new bioinformatics tool to map potential RAG targets in all jawed vertebrates. We show that our REcombination Classifier (REC) outperforms the currently available tool and is suitable for full genomes scans from species other than human and mouse. Using the REC, we document a reduction in density of potential RAG targets at the transcription start sites of genes co-expressed with the <b>rag</b> genes and <b>marked</b> with high levels of the trimethylation of the lysine 4 of the histone 3 (H 3 K 4 me 3), which correlates with the retention of functional RAG activity after the horizontal transfer.

60|$|For myself, however, I did but {{exchange}} anxieties. I was {{no sooner}} {{out of one}} fear than I fell upon another; no sooner secure that I should myself make the intended haven, than I began to be convinced that Trent was there before me. I climbed into the rigging, stood on the board, and eagerly scanned that ring of coral reef and bursting breaker, and the blue lagoon which they enclosed. The two islets within began to show plainly--Middle Brooks and Lower Brooks Island, the Directory named them: two low, bush-covered, rolling strips of sand, each with glittering beaches, each perhaps a mile or {{a mile and a}} half in length, running east and west, and divided by a narrow channel. Over these, innumerable as maggots, there hovered, chattered, and screamed millions of twinkling sea-birds; white and black; the black by far the largest. With singular scintillations, this vortex of winged life swayed to and fro in the strong sunshine, whirled continually through itself, and would now and again burst asunder and scatter as wide as the lagoon: so that I was irresistibly reminded of what I had read of nebular convulsions. A thin cloud overspread the area of the reef and the adjacent sea--the dust, as I could not but fancy, of earlier explosions. And, a little apart, there was yet another focus of centrifugal and centripetal flight, where, hard by the deafening line of breakers, her sails (all but the tattered topsail) snugly furled down, and the red <b>rag</b> that <b>marks</b> Old England on the seas beating, union down, at the main--the Flying Scud, the fruit of so many toilers, a recollection of so many lives of men, whose tall spars had been mirrored in the remotest corners of the sea--lay stationary at last and for ever, in the first stage of naval dissolution. Towards her the taut Norah Creina, vulture-wise, wriggled to windward: come from so far to pick her bones. And, look as I pleased, there was no other presence of man or of man's handiwork; no Honolulu schooner lay there crowded with armed rivals, no smoke rose from the fire at which I fancied Trent cooking a meal of sea-birds. It seemed, after all, we were in time, and I drew a mighty breath.|$|R
