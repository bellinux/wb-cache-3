So before establishing a new runway the current runway structure can be used more efficiently, leading to optimal solutions for individual constraints.

50|$|The {{original}} {{single runway}} was 4800 ft long, oriented on a magnetic heading of 210 degrees (Runway 21) and 30 degrees (Runway 3). In 1964 the airport was rebuilt, with its present two parallel <b>runway</b> <b>configuration,</b> oriented 190 degrees and 10 degrees magnetic. The longer runway, 19R(now 20R), at 5701 ft, is only 901 ft {{longer than the}} old Runway 21 but long enough to legally accommodate jet airliners. A full instrument landing system (ILS) was also installed to serve commercial operations. During the 1950s, the only airline flights were Bonanza's few flights between Los Angeles and Phoenix, via San Diego. In 1963, Bonanza started nonstop F27s to Phoenix, and to Las Vegas in 1965; in 1967, Air California started Electra nonstops to San Francisco, 48 flights a week each way. The first scheduled jet flights were Bonanza DC-9s later in 1967.|$|E

50|$|A new {{international}} airport for New Orleans was also envisioned for the far eastern portion of Eastern New Orleans on several occasions. In the late 1960s, formal government-sponsored studies were undertaken {{to evaluate the}} feasibility of relocating New Orleans International Airport to a new site, contemporaneous with similar efforts that were ultimately successful in Houston (George Bush Intercontinental Airport) and Dallas (Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport).

40|$|Abstract — The <b>runway</b> <b>configuration</b> is the {{subset of}} the runways at an airport that are used for arrivals and departures at any time. Many factors, {{including}} weather (wind and visibility), expected arrival and departure demand, environ-mental considerations such as noise abatement procedures, and coordination of flows with neighboring airports, govern the choice of <b>runway</b> <b>configuration.</b> This paper develops a statistical model to characterize this process using empirical observations. In particular, we demonstrate how a maximum-likelihood discrete-choice model of the <b>runway</b> <b>configuration</b> process can be estimated using aggregate traffic count and other archived data at an airport, that are available over 15 minute intervals. We show that the estimated discrete-choice model not only identifies the influence of various factors in decision-making, but also provides significantly better predictions of <b>runway</b> <b>configuration</b> changes than a baseline model based on the frequency of occurrence of different configurations.

40|$|The System-Oriented Runway Management (SORM) {{concept is}} a {{collection}} of capabilities focused on a more efficient use of runways while considering all of the factors that affect runway use. Tactical <b>Runway</b> <b>Configuration</b> Management (TRCM), one of the SORM capabilities, provides <b>runway</b> <b>configuration</b> and runway usage recommendations, and monitoring the active <b>runway</b> <b>configuration</b> for suitability given existing factors. This report focuses on the metroplex environment, with two or more proximate airports having arrival and departure operations that are highly interdependent. The myriad of factors that affect metroplex opeations require consideration in arriving at runway configurations that collectively best serve the system as a whole. To assess the metroplex TRCM (mTRCM) benefit, the performance metrics must be compared with the actual historical operations. The historical configuration schedules can be viewed as the schedules produced by subject matter experts (SMEs), and therefore are referred to as the SMEs' schedules. These schedules were obtained from the FAA's Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) database; this is the most representative information regarding <b>runway</b> <b>configuration</b> selection by SMEs.
