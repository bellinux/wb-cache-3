25|$|This process uses {{two large}} smooth or {{corrugated}} rolls spinning {{at the same}} speed in opposite directions at a controlled distance. After rolling, the oats are then toasted to make <b>rolled</b> <b>oats.</b> Oat flakes, also known as <b>rolled</b> <b>oats,</b> have many different sizes, thicknesses and other characteristics {{depending on the size of}} oat groats passed between the rolls. Typically, the three sizes of steel cut oats are used to make instant, baby and quick <b>rolled</b> <b>oats,</b> whereas whole oat groats are used to make regular, medium and thick <b>rolled</b> <b>oats.</b> Oat flakes range in thickness from 0.36mm to 1.00mm.|$|E

25|$|The oat (Avena sativa), {{sometimes}} called the common oat, is a species of cereal grain grown for its seed, which is known by the same name (usually in the plural, unlike other cereals and pseudocereals). While oats are {{suitable for human consumption}} as oatmeal and <b>rolled</b> <b>oats,</b> {{one of the most common}} uses is as livestock feed. Oats are a nutrient-rich food associated with lower blood cholesterol when consumed regularly.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the following study were to compare a recently developed low lignin- high fat oat with regular oat as an energy source for use in diets fed to growing-finishing pigs and to compare hammer milling and roller milling as methods of processing oats. A total of 40 crossbred grower pigs (20 barrows and 20 gilts) were {{assigned to one of}} five dietary treatments in a factorial design experiment. The control diet was formulated using barley and soybean meal while four experimental diets were formulated in which 40 % of either normal or low lignin-high fat oat was substituted for barley. The oats were either ground or rolled. Particle size analysis indicated that the average particle size of the grower diets was 884, 1037, 1420, 1031 and 1501 m while for the finisher diets, the average particle size was 800, 869, 1250, 854 and 1098 m for the barley, ground normal oat, rolled normal oat, ground low lignin-high fat oat and rolled low lignin-high fat oat diets respectively. Digestibility coefficients for pigs fed ground oats were significantly (p 0. 05) in nutrient digestibility between pigs fed normal and low lignin-high fat oat. During the growing period (35. 1 to 71. 4 kg) as well as over the entire experiment (35. 1 to 112. 5 kg), there were no differences (p> 0. 05) in daily gain, feed intake or feed conversion between pigs fed normal or low lignin-high fat oat or between pigs fed ground or rolled oat diets. During the finishing period (71. 4 to 112. 5 kg), feed intake and feed conversion were poorer (p< 0. 05) for pigs fed the low lignin-high fat oat compared with the barley diet. There were no differences in carcass traits between pigs fed normal and low lignin-high fat oat or between pigs fed <b>rolled</b> and ground <b>oats.</b> The overall results of this experiment indicate that both normal and low lignin-high fat oat can substitute for barley at levels as high as 40 % of the diet without hindering pig performance. Since the average yield of oat can be equal or higher than barley with lower input costs, a re-examination of feeding recommendations regarding oat in swine rations seems warranted. In addition, since pig performance and carcass traits were not affected by processing method and roller mills have been shown to have lower-energy requirements, lower maintenance costs, quieter operation, and more exact control of particle size than hammer mills, there may be some advantage for pig producers to consider roller mills rather than hammer mills for use in processing pig feeds...|$|R
25|$|Beta-D-glucans, usually {{referred}} to as beta-glucans, comprise a class of indigestible polysaccharides widely found in nature in sources such as grains, barley, yeast, bacteria, algae and mushrooms. In oats, barley and other cereal grains, they are located primarily in the endosperm cell wall. The oat beta-glucan health claim applies to oat bran, <b>rolled</b> <b>oats,</b> whole oat flour and oatrim, a soluble fraction of alpha-amylase hydrolyzed oat bran or whole oat flour.|$|E
25|$|After {{reports of}} {{research}} finding that dietary oats can help lower cholesterol, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a final rule that allows food companies to make health claims on food labels of foods that contain soluble fiber from whole oats (oat bran, oat flour and <b>rolled</b> <b>oats),</b> noting that 3.0grams of soluble fiber daily from these foods {{may reduce the}} risk of heart disease. To qualify for the health claim, the food that contains the oats must provide at least 0.75grams of soluble fiber per serving.|$|E
25|$|Oat {{beta-glucan}} is a viscous polysaccharide made up {{of units}} of the monosaccharide D-glucose. Oat beta-glucan is composed of mixed-linkage polysaccharides. This means the bonds between the D-glucose or D-glucopyranosyl units are either beta-1, 3 linkages or beta-1, 4 linkages. This type of beta-glucan is {{also referred to as}} a mixed-linkage (1→3), (1→4)-beta-D-glucan. The (1→3)-linkages break up the uniform structure of the beta-D-glucan molecule and make it soluble and flexible. In comparison, the indigestible polysaccharide cellulose is also a beta-glucan, but is not soluble because of its (1→4)-beta-D-linkages. The percentages of beta-glucan in the various whole oat products are: oat bran, having from 5.5% to 23.0%; <b>rolled</b> <b>oats,</b> about 4%; and whole oat flour about 4%.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, the FDA {{approved}} of {{a claim that}} intake of at least 3.0 g of β-glucan from oats per day decreased absorption of dietary cholesterol and reduced the risk of coronary heart disease. The approved health claim was later amended to include these sources of β-glucan: <b>rolled</b> <b>oats</b> (oatmeal), oat bran, whole oat flour, oatrim, whole grain barley and barley beta-fiber. An example of an allowed label claim: Soluble fiber from foods such as oatmeal, {{as part of a}} diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. A serving of oatmeal supplies 0.75 grams of the 3.0 g of β-glucan soluble fiber necessary per day to have this effect. The claim language is in the Federal Register 21 CFR 101.81 Health Claims: Soluble fiber from certain foods and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).|$|E
