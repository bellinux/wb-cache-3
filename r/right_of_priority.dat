40|$|Section 25 - 27, i. e. the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> the Employment Protection Act, {{is a form}} of post-employment {{protection}} which {{exists to}} support those employed on a part-time basis and former employees. When a vacancy arises an employer should first and foremost offer part-time employees employment at a higher level of occupation or offer employment to former employees. The various types of employment contracts, other than those valid for an indefinite term, have increased during the last decades on the Swedish labour market. Labour hire has become more common and therefore we find it interesting to investigate how the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> apply. The purpose of this thesis is to describe and analyze the law with regards to labour hire when people with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> are available. We have formulated the following questions: what differentiates an employee and an assignee, to what extent is it possible to utilize labour hire rather than re-employ someone with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> in accordance with Section 25 of the Employment Protection Act or offer a part-time employee employment at a higher level of occupation in accordance with Section 25 a of the Employment Protection Act and are the possibilities for an employer in the public sector different from the possibilities for an employer in the private sector to utilize labour hire rather than re-employ someone with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> in accordance with Section 25 of the Employment Protection Act or offer a part-time employee employment at a higher level of occupation in accordance with Section 25 a of the Employment Protection Act? There is no sole criterion that defines whether a person is an employee or an assignee. Instead, all existing circumstances in each particular case must be observed. However, there are two fundamental requirements that must be present in order for a person to be regarded as an employee. The first requirement is that {{the relationship between the two}} parties (the employer and the employee) is based on an agreement between the two. The second requirement is that the agreement has to encompass one party providing labour for the second. With this in mind, an employee in a labour hire organisation cannot be regarded as an employee in the company which has hired labour as in this case there is no contractual relationship between the employee and the company to whom the labour is provided. For an employer to be looked upon as bypassing the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> rules in a prohibited fashion a number of criteria must be fulfilled. Firstly, the employer must have disregarded the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> and furthermore this act must be proved. Secondly, the employer must have consciously intended to do so. Ultimately, the action, with all specific circumstances taken into consideration, must be seen as tortious. There has been no ruling where labour hire has been determined as an act of prohibited bypassing <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> but the Labour Court has concluded that it cannot be excluded as a possibility. The <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> can only be applied when new staff are employed. Therefore, it is our opinion that an unlawful bypassing <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> rules could potentially occur when the hiring of an assignee is regarded as a new employment. For this to take place the “assignee” must be regarded as an employee. However, we find it difficult to see how hiring labour from a labour hire organization could be regarded as an unlawful bypassing <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> rules. Although the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> differ in some ways for employees in the public sector we still consider that the possibility to utilize labour hire for employers in the public sector, when there are people with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> available, is in principle unchanged in comparison to employers in the private sector...|$|R

6000|$|On {{just such}} a street in the once {{thriving}} New England village of Dolton had Edward been born. In Dolton Bumpus was once a name of names, rooted there since the seventeenth century, {{and if you had}} cared to listen he would have told you, in a dialect precise but colloquial, the history of a family that by <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> and service should have been destined to inherit the land, but whose descendants were preserved to see it delivered to the alien. The God of Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards had been tried in the balance and found wanting. Edward could never understand this; or why the Universe, so long static and immutable, had suddenly begun to move. He had always been prudent, but in spite of youthful [...] "advantages," [...] of an education, so called, from a sectarian college on a hill, he had never been taught that, while prudence may prosper in a static world, it is a futile virtue in a dynamic one. Experience even had been powerless to impress this upon him. For more than twenty years after leaving college he had clung to a clerkship in a Dolton mercantile establishment before he felt justified in marrying Hannah, the daughter of Elmer Wench, when the mercantile establishment amalgamated with a rival--and Edward's services were no longer required. During the succession of precarious places with decreasing salaries he had subsequently held a terrified sense of economic pressure had gradually crept over him, presently growing strong enough, after two girls had arrived, to compel the abridgment of the family....It would be painful to record in detail the cracking-off process, the slipping into shale, the rolling, the ending up in Hampton, where Edward had now for some dozen years been keeper of one of the gates in the frowning brick wall bordering the canal,--a position obtained for him by a compassionate but not too prudent childhood friend who had risen in life and knew the agent of the Chippering Mill, Mr. Claude Ditmar. Thus had virtue failed to hold its own.|$|E

I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall, but I expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest {{in the belief that}} it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward, till it shall become alike lawful in all the States,--old as well as new, North as well as South." [...] Then he proceeded {{to point out that the}} Nebraska doctrine combined with the Dred Scott decision worked in the direction of making the nation [...] "all slave." [...] Here was the [...] "irrepressible conflict" [...] spoken of by Seward a short time later, in a speech made famous mainly by that phrase. If there was any new discovery in it, the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> was Lincoln's. This utterance proved not only his statesmanlike conception of the issue, but also, in his situation as a candidate, the firmness of his moral courage. The friends to whom he had read the draught of this speech before he delivered it warned him anxiously that its delivery might be fatal to his success in the election. This was shrewd advice, in the ordinary sense. While a slaveholder could threaten disunion with impunity, the mere suggestion that the existence of slavery was incompatible with freedom in the Union would hazard the political chances of any public man in the North. But Lincoln was inflexible. [...] "It is true," [...] said he, [...] "and I will deliver it as written.... I would rather be defeated with these expressions in my speech held up and discussed before the people than be victorious without them." [...] The statesman was right in his far-seeing judgment and his conscientious statement of the truth, but the practical politicians were also right in their prediction of the immediate effect. Douglas instantly seized upon the declaration that a house divided against itself cannot stand as the main objective point of his attack, interpreting it as an incitement to a [...] "relentless sectional war," [...] and there is no doubt that the persistent reiteration of this charge served to frighten not a few timid souls.|$|E

Since the manual setup of such RNL is time-consuming and error prone, an approach for automatically generating RNL based on standardized OpenDRIVE data is introduced. For evaluation purposes, generated RNL were integrated into 3 D scenes. The mapping of the RNL to the environment was examined and simulations were run for empirical validation. As a result, the automatically generated RNL could be successfully matched with the created 3 D scenes, allowing our traffic simulation approach to be run on the final scenes.

60|$|London is so {{manifold}} (as I {{have all}} along been saying) {{that it would}} be advisable, if one could, to see it in a sort of severalty, and take it in the successive strata of its unfathomable interest. Perhaps it could best be visited by a syndicate of cultivated Americans; then one could give himself to its political or civic interest, another to its religious memories and associations, another to its literary and artistic records; no one American, however cultivated, could do justice to all these claims, even with life and health of an expectation beyond that of the most uncultivated American. Besides this suggestion I should like to offer a warning, and this is, that no matter with what devoted passion the American lover of London approaches her he must not hope for an exclusive possession of her heart. If she is insurpassably the most interesting, the most fascinating of all the cities that ever were, let him be sure that he is not the first to find it out. He may not like it, but he must reconcile himself to seeing some English rival before him in devotion to any aspect of her divinity. It is not for nothing that poets, novelists, historians, antiquarians have been born in England for so many ages; and not a palm's breadth of her sky, not a foot of her earth, not a stone or brick of her myriad wallspaces but has been fondly noted, studied, and described in prose, or celebrated in verse.

This work proposes a biologically inspired {{solution for the}} coordination of trains in dense railway networks, avoiding collisions with considerably higher cost efficiency than {{the state of the}} art solutions. This solution does not require track mounted infrastructure, instead it relies on the continuous cooperation between trains. Inspired by self-organizing biological systems, two simple algorithms are proposed for managing points of conflict or switches where the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> way or <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> trains has to be carefully handled. The first-level algorithm avoids local collisions by the exchange of status information through beacons. The second-level algorithm uses one-hop or multi-hop communication to share the network status among trains and coordinates the trains in possible conflict zones around switches or in shunting yards. The proposed solution can decrease the signalling cost ofrailway transport substantially. This efficient approach can significantly reduce the probability of accidents caused by human and hardware errors. In addition, the proposed approach can lead to significant time and energy savings in railway transport. The biologically inspired solution proposed in this paper might lead to a paradigm shift in the signalling system used in rail transportation...|$|R
