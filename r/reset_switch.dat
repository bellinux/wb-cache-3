30|$|The above {{experiment}} and thermal dissolution model results both {{demonstrated that the}} statistical spread of reset parameters Vreset and Ireset are intrinsically limited by the on-state resistance Ron, so controlling the value and distribution of Ron is very critical to acquire high uniformity of <b>reset</b> <b>switching.</b> In the previous works, some methods have been proposed to reduce the variation of the off-state resistance (Roff) and on-state resistance (Ron), through which the uniformity of the set and <b>reset</b> <b>switching</b> parameters also have been improved and the set and reset events are controlled in certain ranges. These methods include: 1) doping impurities in the switching layer [30], selecting the electrode materials [31], and inserting interface layers [32] so as to effectively control the concentration and distribution of defects such as charge traps, metal ions, and oxygen vacancies etc.; 2) introducing the electric field-concentrating initiators (e.g., nanocrystals) on the bottom electrode to enhance the local electric field and reduce the random growth of filaments [16]; and 3) utilizing optimized operation methods [33]. In our recent work, we have also {{paid attention to the}} new pulse operation with regard to its role in improving the switching uniformity. Different from the traditional single pulse operation method in which only one wide pulse is applied in each switching cycle, a novel width/height-adjusting pulse operation method is proposed for RRAM. This method utilizes a series of pulses with the width or height increased gradually until a set or <b>reset</b> <b>switching</b> process is completely finished and no excessive stress is produced. The new operation method can exactly control the final resistance and significantly improve the uniformity, stability, and endurance of RRAM device. Additionally, we are also focusing on optimizing the device structure by etching the substrate into a cone shape on which the RRAM device is fabricated. The optimized structure can control the formation and rupture of the conductive filament in the oxide layer {{at the tip of the}} cone shape due to the high-generated electric field in this position. Thus, the variation of the switching parameters can be significantly reduced and the uniformity of these parameters will be improved.|$|R

The protective device will automatically switch {{off when the}} devices plugged into it are drawing more power than the strip is rated to supply. For example, the standard rating for overload protected power strips is 2400W in Australia, so exceeding that amount of power will make the circuit breaker trip. Power strips offering only overload protection generally {{do not have a}} power light, but they do have a <b>reset</b> <b>switch,</b> which is used to return the strip to service after an overload has caused it to trip.|$|E

They did not have to wait long before they captured a rather clear picture of one of the middle-managers resetting the machine at 2AM.

Experience points do not exist in the game, although every so often, items such as staves, potions, or magic rings will be found in the spoils of battle, or inside of the aforementioned buildings. These items have a random chance of either raising or lowering the player's Strength or Dexterity.|$|E
30|$|As {{the abrupt}} reset {{behavior}} has the advantages to the reliable binary operation of RRAM, {{it is important}} to control the reset transition. Some methods can be used to get the abrupt <b>reset</b> <b>switching.</b> For example, utilizing current sweep [37, 38] operation in a single RRAM cell or using gate voltage sweep operation in a 1 T 1 R structure [39], the reset transition can be implemented to preset well-controlled abrupt switching characteristics. By combining the above method with the approaches of increasing resistances such as introducing a barrier layer, it is expected to achieve the abrupt and low-power set/reset operation.|$|R

This switch with fast SET and slow RESET transition may have potential applications in some special regions.|$|R

By selecting the proper resistance value of RS for the set and reset cycles respectively, we observed a dramatically improved endurance of the TaOx memristor. Such a voltage divider effect can thus be critical for the memristor applications that require low variability, high endurance and fast speed...|$|R

In the switching from a high-resistance state (HRS) to a low-resistance state (LRS) during the set process, the formation of filament is the dominant process. The switching is easier to occur with a shorter off time between pulses, indicating that heat diffusion plays an important role. On the other hand, in the switching from the LRS to the HRS during the reset process, there is a competition between the formation and deformation of filament, which is much stronger than that in the set process. The heat diffusion during the off time between pulses affects both the formation and deformation of filaments.
