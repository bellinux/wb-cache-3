40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is an {{engineering}} design of <b>plunger</b> <b>pump</b> with linear motor. This type of pump is used especially for blood pumping in heart surgery. The theoretical part is focused on distribution of pumps, description of extracorporeal circuit and booster heart history. There are basic calculations derived, which describe <b>plunger</b> <b>pump</b> performance.

50|$|Triplex <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> use three <b>plungers,</b> {{which reduces}} the {{pulsation}} of single reciprocating <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps.</b> Adding a pulsation dampener on the pump outlet can further smooth the pump ripple, or ripple graph of a pump transducer. The dynamic {{relationship of the}} high-pressure fluid and plunger generally requires high-quality <b>plunger</b> seals. <b>Plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> with {{a larger number of}} plungers have the benefit of increased flow, or smoother flow without a pulsation dampener. The increase in moving parts and crankshaft load is one drawback.|$|R

For example, <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> that function in general service or oil service applications often have an iron cylinder and plunger.

The working conditions for a hydraulic pump are therefore required to be improved in the design stage or as early as possible. Considering the structural features, parameters, and operating environment of a hydraulic <b>plunger</b> <b>pump,</b> the vibration modes for two-degree-of-freedom system were established by using vibration theory and hydraulic technology. Afterwards, the analytical form of the natural frequency and the numerical solution of the steady-state response were deduced for a hydraulic <b>plunger</b> <b>pump.</b> Then, a method for the vibration analysis of a hydraulic pump was proposed.

5000|$|Rotary piston and <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> use a crank {{mechanism}} {{to create a}} reciprocating motion along an axis, which then builds pressure in a cylinder or working barrel to force gas or fluid through the pump. The pressure in the chamber actuates the valves at both the suction and discharge points. <b>Plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> are used in applications that could range from [...] Piston pumps are used in lower pressure applications. The volume of the fluid discharged {{is equal to the}} area of the plunger or piston, multiplied by its stroke length. The overall capacity of the piston <b>pumps</b> and <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> can be calculated with the area of the piston or plunger, the stroke length, the number of pistons or plungers and the speed of the drive. The power needed from the drive is proportional to the pressure and capacity of the pump.|$|R
40|$|As the <b>plunger</b> <b>pump</b> always {{works in}} a {{complicated}} environment and the hydraulic cycle has an intrinsic fluid-structure interaction character, the fault information is submerged in the noise and the disturbance impact signals. For the fault diagnosis of the bearings in <b>plunger</b> <b>pump,</b> an optimum intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) selection based envelope analysis was proposed. Firstly, the Wigner-Ville distribution was calculated for the acquired vibration signals, and the resonance frequency brought on by fault was obtained. Secondly, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was employed for the vibration signal, and the optimum IMFs and the filter bandwidth were selected according to the Wigner-Ville distribution. Finally, the envelope analysis was utilized for the selected IMFs filtered by the band pass filter, and the fault type was recognized by compared with the bearing character frequencies. For the two modes, inner race fault and compound fault in the inner race and roller of rolling element bearing in <b>plunger</b> <b>pump,</b> the experiments show that a promising result is achieved...|$|R
