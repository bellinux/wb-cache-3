40|$|Abstract. Human-robot {{interaction}} {{is a complex}} field of robotics in which robots are required to deal with different challenging issues. Among other skills, HRI-capable robots need to generate plans taking humans into account. To achieve this robots require sufficiently efficient data structures and rich information about their environment as well as about humans and their abilities. An additional requirement when robots are supposed to actively find and classify objects is the capability of reason-ing about the creation and <b>retyping</b> <b>of</b> the symbols corresponding to the objects {{as a result of}} the actions of their plans. This paper describes how these requirements can be met using a combination of dynamic graph-like world models and a planning system based on graph-rewriting rules. To demonstrate how the approach can be applied, the paper builds upon a robot butler use-case, describing how its world model is structured and its most relevant planning rules.
