RadNet collects and analyzes data on radionuclides in air, rainwater, surface water, milk and drinking water samples. RadNet has found elevated iodine-131 (I-131) levels in Philadelphia's drinking water several times since 2007 during routine quarterly monitoring. Iodine-131 is used to diagnose and treat thyroid cancer, is produced via nuclear fission, is a byproduct of nuclear power and weapons testing, and is a tracer used in hydraulic fracturing. Iodine-131 is also used in annual tests for leaks in injection wells containing waste. Originally the elevated levels were suspected {{to be related to the}} Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster or medical waste. The EPA sample results for I-131 published in the April 2012 RadNet posting were determined to be unrelated to radiation from Japan and other nuclear-power sources in the Philadelphia area. By March 2012 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection had ruled out the nuclear disaster, local nuclear energy production, or hospitals as sources and concluded by process of elimination that the episodically elevated levels were probably caused by patients receiving iodine therapy for the treatment of thyroid cancer.|$|E

40|$|The United States Department of Energy (U. S. DOE) has {{recently}} implemented {{a series of}} strategic initiatives to address long-term <b>radiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> needs at former U. S. nuclear test sites in the Marshall Islands. The plan is to engage local atoll communities in developing shared responsibilities for implementing radiation protection monitoring programs for resettled and resettling populations in the northern Marshall Islands. Using the pooled resources of the U. S. DOE and local atoll governments, individual <b>radiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> programs have been developed in whole body counting and plutonium urinalysis in order to accurately assess radiation doses resulting from the ingestion and uptake of fallout radionuclides contained in locally grown foods. Permanent whole body counting facilities have been established at three separate locations in the Marshall Islands (Figure 1). These facilities are operated and maintained by Marshallese technicians with scientists from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) providing on-going technical support services. Bioassay samples are collected under controlled conditions and analyzed for plutonium isotopes at the Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry at LLNL using state-of-the art measurement technologies. We also conduct an on-going environmental monitoring and characterization program at selected sites in the northern Marshall Islands. The aim of the environmental program {{is to determine the}} level and distribution of important fallout radionuclides in soil, water and local foods with a view towards providing more accurate and updated dose assessments, incorporating knowledge of the unique behaviors and exposure pathways of fallout radionuclides in coral atoll ecosystems. These scientific studies have also been essential in helping guide the development of remedial options used in support of island resettlement. Together, the individual and environmental <b>radiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> programs are helping meet the informational needs of the U. S. DOE and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Our updated environmental assessments provide a strong scientific basis for predicting future change in exposure conditions especially in relation to changes in life-style, diet and/or land-use patterns. This information has important implications in addressing questions about existing (and future) radiological conditions on the islands, in determining the cost and the effectiveness of potential remedial measures, and in general policy support considerations. Perhaps most importantly, the recently established individual <b>radiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> programs provide affected atoll communities with an unprecedented level of radiation protection monitoring where, for the first time, local resources are being made available to monitor resettled and resettling populations on a continuous basis.

Initial conservative <b>radiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> is often requested by patients and physicians to establish whether these tumors are growing before embarking on intervention. Initial observation of at least 1 year in all small VS was therefore recommended by some authors. We evaluated our prospective skull base database of VSs that were managed with initial <b>radiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> to establish when this policy should be abandoned and what predicts future growth. Fifty-four consecutive patients with VS in our institution who were managed by initial yearly MRI scanning were studied. The MRI data were collected prospectively and analyzed by Kodak CareStream viewing software where VS maximum diameters in three perpendicular planes and volume were calculated. One patient was excluded from the analysis as he had only one MRI follow-up. The median age of the 53 patients was 59 years (range, 26 to 86 years), 25 were males and 28 were females, and 33 were under 65 years of age; 18 VSs were extracanalicular, 18 were intracanalicular, and 17 extended {{both inside and outside}} the canal; 21 VSs were 1. 2 cm 3 or less, 22 were 1. 2 to 4 cm 3, and the rest were > 4 cm 3. Using volumetric analysis, 29. 72 % of conservatively managed VS grew by at least 2 mm per year, and 70. 82 % did not grow in 5 years. Age, gender, symptoms, and side did not predict future growth. However, growth in the first year was a strong predictor of future growth (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and initial volume was also a strong predictor of future growth (p[*]<[*] 0. 05).

40|$|This report {{contains}} individual <b>radiological</b> protection <b>surveillance</b> data {{developed during}} 2006 for adult {{members of a}} select group of families living on Utrok Atoll. These Group I volunteers all underwent a whole-body count to determine levels of internally deposited cesium- 137 ({sup 137 }Cs) and supplied a bioassay sample for analysis of plutonium isotopes. Measurement data were obtained and the results compared with an equivalent set of measurement data for {sup 137 }Cs and plutonium isotopes from a second group of adult volunteers (Group II) who were long-term residents of Utrok Atoll. For the purposes of this comparison, Group II volunteers were considered representative of the general population on Utrok Atoll. The general aim {{of the study was to}} determine residual systemic burdens of fallout radionuclides in each volunteer group, develop data in response to addressing some specific concerns about the preferential uptake and potential health consequences of residual fallout radionuclides in Group I volunteers, and generally provide some perspective on the significance of radiation doses delivered to volunteers (and the general Utrok Atoll resident population) in terms of radiological protection standards and health risks. Based on dose estimates from measurements of internally deposited {sup 137 }Cs and plutonium isotopes, the data and information developed in this report clearly show that neither volunteer group has acquired levels of internally deposited fallout radionuclides specific to nuclear weapons testing in the Marshall Islands that are likely to have any consequence on human health. Moreover, the dose estimates are well below radiological protection standards as prescribed by U. S. regulators and international agencies, and are very small when compared to doses from natural sources of radiation in the Marshall Islands and the threshold where radiation health effects could be either medically diagnosed in an individual or epidemiologically discerned in a group of people. In general, the results from the whole-body counting measurements of 137 Cs are consistent with our knowledge that a key pathway for exposure to residual fallout contamination on Utrok Atoll is low-level chronic uptake of {sup 137 }Cs from the consumption of locally grown produce (Robison et al., 1999). The error-weighted, average body burden of {sup 137 }Cs measured in Group I and Group II volunteers was 0. 31 kBq and 0. 62 kBq, respectively. The associated average, annual committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE) delivered to Group I and Group II volunteers from {sup 137 }Cs during the year of measurement was 2. 1 and 4. 0 mrem. For comparative purposes, the annual dose limit for members of the public as recommended by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) and the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) is 100 mrem. Consequently, specific concerns about elevated levels of {sup 137 }Cs uptake and higher risks from radiation exposure to Group I volunteers would be considered unfounded. Moreover, the urinary excretion of plutonium- 239 ({sup 239 }Pu) from Group I and Group II volunteers is statistically indistinguishable. In this case, the error-weighted, average urinary excretion of {sup 239 }Pu from Group I volunteers of 0. 10 {mu}Bq per 24 -h void with a range between - 0. 01 and 0. 23 {mu}Bq per 24 -h void compares with an error-weighted average from Group II volunteers of 0. 11 {mu}Bq per 24 -h void with a range between - 0. 20 and 0. 47 {mu}Bq per 24 -h void. The range in urinary excretion of {sup 239 }Pu from Utrok Atoll residents is very similar to that observed for other population groups in the Marshall Islands (Bogen et al., 2006; Hamilton et al., 2006 a; 2006 b; 2006 c, 2007 a; 2007 b; 2007 c) and is generally considered representative of worldwide background...|$|R

40|$|The United States Department of Energy (U. S. DOE) has {{recently}} implemented {{a series of}} strategic initiatives to address long-term <b>radiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> needs at former U. S. nuclear test sites in the Marshall Islands ([URL] Local atoll governments have been actively engaged in developing shared responsibilities for protecting {{the health and safety}} of resettled and resettling population at risk from exposure to elevated levels of residual fallout contamination in the environment. Under the program, whole body counting facilities have been established at three locations in the Marshall Islands. These facilities are operated and maintained by Marshallese technicians with scientists from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) providing technical support services including data quality assurance and performance testing. We have also established a mirror whole body counting facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as a technician training center. The LLNL facility also allows program managers to develop quality assurance and operational procedures, and test equipment and corrective actions prior to deployment at remote stations in the Marshall Islands. This document summarizes the results of external performance evaluation exercises conducted at each of the facilities (2002 - 2005) under the umbrella of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Intercomparison Studies Program (ISP). The ISP was specifically designed to meet intercomparison requirements of the United States (U. S.) Department of Energy Laboratory Accreditation Program (DOELAP). In this way, the Marshall Islands <b>Radiological</b> <b>Surveillance</b> Program has attempted to establish quality assurance measures in whole body counting that are consistent with standard requirements used to monitor DOE workers in the United States. Based on ANSI N 13. 30, the acceptable performance criteria for relative measurement bias and precision for radiobioassay service laboratory quality control, performance evaluation, and accreditation is - 25 % to + 50 % and less than or equal to 40 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|In the Asia-Pacific region, {{autologous}} and allogeneic {{bone marrow}} transplantation (BMT) in patients infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) may be complicated by fatal hepatic failure due to viral reactivation. Survivors may suffer from accelerated hepatitis and cirrhosis. We report the first case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after autologous BMT for mediastinal B cell lymphoma. The tumor developed rampantly during a planned pregnancy 5 years after BMT. Less than 40 cases of HCC complicating pregnancy have been reported, and outcome is invariably poor. Immunosuppression and HBV reactivation after autologous BMT, as well as immune tolerance and hormonal changes associated with pregnancy {{may contribute to the}} rapid tumor growth. Biochemical and <b>radiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> for HCC should be strengthened in HBV carriers after BMT, especially in patients with the histology of chronic liver disease, or biochemical/virological evidence of increased HBV activity. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionJuvenile ossifying fibroma {{is a rare}} benign fibro-osseous lesion. It is {{characterized}} by the early age of onset, the localization of the tumor, the radiological pattern and a tendency to recurrence. In the light of a clinical case, we review the clinical, histological and radiological features of this tumor. Case reportWe report a case of a nine year old male child who presented with a unilateral swelling of the right middle face with right proptosis. Clinical examination showed a mass filling the right nasal cavity. CT scan and MRI were performed. Biopsy suggests a fibro-osseous lesion. The patient undertook surgery by a degloving approach with complete tumor removal. The histopathological examination revealed the diagnosis of a juvenile ossifying fibroma. No recurrence was noted. ConclusionBecause of its aggressive and compressive nature, juvenile ossifying fibroma requires an early complete surgical excision. A long-term clinical and <b>radiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> is necessary to prevent recurrence...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new code {{for the analysis}} of gamma spectra generated by an equipment for continuous measurement and identification of gamma radioactivity in aerosols with paper filter. It is called pGamma and has been developed by the NERG group at the Technical University of Catalonia - Barcelona Tech and Raditel Serveis i Subministraments TecnolÃ²gics, Ltd. The code is being adapted to the monitors of the Environmental <b>Radiological</b> <b>Surveillance</b> Network of the Generalitat de Catalunya (local Catalan Government), Spain. The code is a spectrum analysis system for identifying and determining activity concentration of gamma emitters. It generates alarms depending on the activity of emitters and then elaborates reports. Moreover, it includes a library with NORM and artificial emitters of interest. The code is being used at three stations of the Network equipped with an aerosol monitor (AscÃ³ and VandellÃ²s (province of Tarragona) and Barcelona). Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an equipment for continuous measurement and identification of gamma radioactivity in aerosols {{developed by the}} Nuclear Engineering Research Group (NERG) at the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) and Raditel Serveis i Subministraments TecnolÃ²gics, Ltd. A spectrometric analysis code has been specially designed for it. Spectrum analysis identifies and determines activity concentration of aerosol emitters captured by a fiberglass paper filter. This new equipment is currently operating in three radioactivity monitoring stations of the Environmental <b>Radiological</b> <b>Surveillance</b> Network of the Generalitat of Catalunya (local Catalan government) : two near AscÃ³ and VandellÃ²s Nuclear Power Plants {{in the province of}} Tarragona and one in the city of Barcelona. Two more monitors are expected to be deployed at Roses (province of Girona) and PuigcerdÃ  (province of Barcelona). Measurements and evolution analysis results of emitters identified at these stations were also provided. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|A 57 -year-old woman {{presented}} with adhesional small bowel obstruction and required a laparotomy and adhesiolysis. Â The postoperative period was complicated by pulmonary embolism. In addition, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram also demonstrated several indeterminate pleural based pulmonary nodules suspicious {{of a primary}} malignancy. Review of this patientâ€™s past medical history revealed a road traffic collision 29 years previously which required a laparotomy, left nephrectomy, splenectomy, and repair of the left hemi-diaphragm. <b>Radiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> with follow-up chest CT demonstrated stable appearance of the indeterminate nodules, and a diagnosis of thoracic splenosis was considered the most likely explanation of the imaging findings. Thoracic splenosis {{must be considered in}} patients presenting with lung nodules and a past history of thoracoabdominal trauma. Radionuclide studies with technetium 99 m (Tc 99 m) sulfur colloid or Tc 99 m heat damaged red cell scans can help confirm or refute this diagnosis and thereby reassure both patient and clinician...|$|E
