The {{potential}} of producing <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> at the global level is 27. 3 million t.

Sunflower wax (SW) and <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> <b>wax</b> (RBW) have a similar chemical composition but a very different crystallization behavior. Therefore, SWand RBW were also combined in a wax-based oleogel to examine the occurrence of co-crystallization and/or crystal coexistence. The thermal and gelation behavior of the binary blends in rice bran oil (5 % w/w total concentration of wax) were investigated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and rheological measurements, showing sequential crystallization and gelation for the SW/RBW : BEW wax-based oleogels and simultaneous crystallization and gelation for the SW : RBW wax-based oleogels. Oscillatory shear and hardness measurements revealed the reinforcement of the high-melting wax crystal network with the addition of the low-melting berry wax. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements in both the long-spacing and the short-spacing region showed the occurrence of crystal co-existence, rather than co-crystallization, which was confirmed with polarized light microscopy (PLM). Two different crystal morphologies could be discerned for all three combinations (RBW : SW, SW : BEW and RBW : BEW). We hypothesized that the improved rheological properties could be attributed to sintering, a process in which the low-melting BEW crystals form solid bonds between the crystals of the high-melting waxes. As such, a cohesive network is formed, resulting in an increased hardness of the bi-wax-based oleogels.

Objective: The objective {{of the study was}} to assess the effects of defatted <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> and <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> oil in an average American diet on blood lipids in moderately hypercholesterolemic persons. Design: Study 1 used a parallel-arm design.

40|$|<b>Rice</b> <b>bran</b> {{effectively}} removed pesticides from an aqueous solution. The removal by <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> {{was examined}} using 22 different pesticides. The removal efficiencies varied from 22. 2 % to 98. 8 %. The {{variation in the}} removal efficiency of different pesticides was studied, and the pesticides with high lipophilicity {{were found to be}} easily removed by <b>rice</b> <b>bran.</b> The amount of captan adsorbed was plotted against the equilibrium concentration of sub-stances in solution on a logarithmic scale, and a linear relationship was obtained, indicating that the adsorption reaction was a Freundlich-type. The mechanism of pesticides removal by <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> was attributed to the uptake into intracellular particles called spherosomes.

40|$|<b>Rice</b> <b>bran</b> is a {{byproduct}} of rice (Oryza sativa) milling that still lacking in its utilization and was limited used for animal feed. Previous {{studies have shown that}} <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> contains high nutrient compounds. This study was conduct d to deterni 1 ne antioxidant activity of n-hexane extract of <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> using diphenyl picryl hydrazil hydrate (DPPH) as stable free radical in spectrophotometric methods. The an tioxidant activity of <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> was determined in operating time about 35 minutes and maximum wavelength 516, 54 nm and antioxidant stret 1 gth shown by EC 50 values. The result showed that <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> positively has antioxidant activity with EC 50 4099, 55 ± 181, 93 bpj...|$|R
40|$|Rice {{is a basic}} {{food for}} {{a large part of}} the world’s population. It is stable food for more than half of humanity. In this present study raw <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> and {{parboiled}} <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> were taken, the proximal compositions of rice also studied in both <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> samples. Proximal composition of raw <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> recorded higher content of moisture, ash, fiber, carbohydrates and mainly in proteins. The protein isolates were obtained by alkaline solubilization process with sodium hydroxide was recorded higher of protein in 0. 3 N concentration SDS-PAGE was carried out in protein isolates of <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> samples. The amino acids profile was done by using High performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) for the sample...|$|R
40|$|A {{scientific}} {{consensus on}} the relationship between obesity, obesity related diseases, and diet has emerged. One of the factors is overconsumption of the red meats such as pork and beef. Goat meat has the potential to replace these traditionally consumed meats. <b>Rice</b> <b>bran</b> is a rich source of antioxidants such as vitamin E. In this study, goat meat sausages were formulated to contain 0, 1. 5 or 3 percent stabilized <b>rice</b> <b>bran.</b> Proximate and fatty acid composition, α-tocopherol, cholesterol concentration, and antioxidant activities of cooked goat meat sausages containing varying percentages of <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> were measured. Data were analyzed using a fixed effects model. The fat percentage in the goat meat sausages increased in response to increasing <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> percentages (P< 0. 001). Saturated fatty acids concentration decreased linearly (P< 0. 01), while unsaturated fatty acids and omega- 3 and omega- 6 fatty acids increased linearly in response to increasing <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> percentages (P< 0. 05). The concentration of α-tocopherol in sausages increased linearly in response to increasing <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> percentages (P< 0. 01). Also, antioxidant activity increased linearly in sausages in response to added <b>rice</b> <b>bran</b> (P< 0. 01). The cholesterol concentration of sausages did not vary significantly in response to added <b>rice</b> <b>bran...</b>|$|R
