40|$|In {{the steel}} industry, the steel bars {{coming out from}} the last stand of the <b>rolling</b> <b>train</b> must be {{conveyed}} to the cooling bed. For this purpose, various types of devices {{are used in the}} different steel factories. In this paper, the rotating channel used in a single steel company is described and investigated. The problem of deriving an adequate dynamic model for the rotating channel is tackled; the model is then exploited to design a controller which can be employed in the real application of the rotating channel. A lumped parameter model of the rotating channel has been designed and used in this work. Moreover, a distributed parameter model has also been implemented, so as to be able to compare the two models and to evaluate the error made by using the lumped parameter model instead of the distributed parameter model. The lumped parameter model has then been used as a basis for the implementation of a time-varying control scheme, which is also presented in the paper. The control has then been successfully tested on an accurate simulator of the plant. The results obtained from the tests have been very encouraging...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{conditions}} required of yarns is to have enough tensile strength {{to allow them to}} be turned into textiles and also to give the final product durability. During processing, threads are subjected to various unavoidable forms of mechanical stress, simple or compounded, but the amount of stress can be kept under control by adjusting the corresponding operating parameters (speed, gauges, push force on the cylinders of the <b>rolling</b> <b>train</b> etc.). The values of the operating parameters of the spinning operation are set so as to obtain uniform products in large scale production, but also to ensure the preservation of the properties of the fibers and yarns, for further processing. To this end we analyzed the tensile strength of three batches of 100 % wool yarn meant for knitting, from three different geo-climatic areas. These are fine woolen yarn of 25 tex and torque of 620 twists/meter. The study of the tensile strength was carried out using a Uster R Tensojet 4 (UTj 4) tension meter, analyzing ten samples of 500 m from each batch. The statistical and mathematical processing of the data obtained after analyzing the samples indicated that the yarns from South Africa have better tensile strength and a lower mechanical impedance variation coefficient than yarns from Asia and England...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{attempts}} {{to establish a}} fuzzy neural automatic incident detection (FNAID) algorithm, using back-propagation <b>training</b> procedures. A <b>rolling</b> <b>training</b> procedure continuously updating the traffic flow parameters is proposed to enhance the adaptability of FNAID to different traffic flow conditions. A real incident case is deliberately generated to calibrate the traffic simulator—Paramics. To validate the FNAID with and without <b>rolling</b> <b>training</b> procedure, the calibrated Paramics is used to simulate sufficient incident samples. The off-line tests and statistic tests conclude that under various traffic flow conditions, the FNAID with <b>rolling</b> <b>training</b> procedure has better detection performance than the one without rolling.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the mechanical system of a self-propelled vehicle on the tires able to move on an uneven ground whilst his platform stays horizontally. It is question to simulate the movement of a desmodromic robot which moves in an environment represented by a 3 D surface. The robot has a mechano-hydraulic system which is able to modify the geometry of chassis in the aim of maintaining the platform always at horizontal while in movement, no matter the soil configuration (of course between some limits). The horizontalisation mechanism with the <b>rolling</b> <b>train</b> hydraulically driven presents some difficulties because of the non holonomic constraints of the wheels ([1, 2]). In order to make the application of the multipoles theory in the structomatical model must be introduce some simplifications in the contact joint. Thus, the non holonomic joints are presented like gamma active joints (with the condition of controlled rolling/skidding). This is an extension of the general principle of mechanism formation ([3]) according who any mechanical structure can be broken in genes upon an unique formula (the genetic code of the mechanism). Because of the complexity of the calculus the study of mechanism was divided in a few chapters: geometrics, structomatics, kinematics, kinetostatics and dynamics etc. The uttermost important and difficult part is the kinematical model because of the non-linearity of the equations. This article presents the first two items; the others will be the matter of future papers...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{are several}} biases and inefficiencies that are {{commonly}} associated with the judgmental extrapolation of time series, even when the forecasters have technical knowledge about forecasting. This study examines the effectiveness of using a <b>rolling</b> <b>training</b> approach, based on feedback, to improve the accuracy of forecasts elicited from people with such knowledge. In an experiment, forecasters were asked to make multiple judgmental extrapolations {{for a set of}} time series from different time origins. For each series in turn, the participants were either unaided or provided with feedback. In the latter case, the true outcomes and performance feedback were provided following the submission of each set of forecasts. The objective was to provide a training scheme that would enable forecasters to understand the underlying pattern of the data better by learning from their forecast errors directly. An analysis of the results indicated that this <b>rolling</b> <b>training</b> approach is an effective method for enhancing the judgmental extrapolations elicited from people with technical knowledge, especially when bias feedback is provided. As such, it could be a valuable element in the design of software systems that are intended to support expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) in forecasting...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a fuzzy-neural model (FNM) {{to predict the}} traffic flows in an urban street network, which has long been considered a major element in the responsive urban traffic control systems. The FNM consists of two modules: a gate network (GN) and an expert network (EN). The GN classifies the input data {{into a number of}} clusters using a fuzzy approach, and the EN specifies the input-output relationship as in a conventional neural network approach. While the GN groups traffic patterns of similar characteristics into clusters, the EN models the specific relationship within each cluster. An online <b>rolling</b> <b>training</b> procedure is proposed to train the FNM, which enhances its predictive power through adaptive adjustments of the model coefficients in response to the real-time traffic conditions. Both simulation and real observation data are used to demonstrative the effectiveness of the method. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
