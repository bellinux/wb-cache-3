After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases, the company decided that the system needed <b>re-engineering.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following a {{demonstration}} at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000machines, with {{the option to}} produce an additional 24,000. Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $10,000 and royalty rights, a marketing firm to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed {{to serve as the}} exclusive sales agent. Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the typewriter, and spent several months retooling and <b>re-engineering</b> the device; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July1, 1874. Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's sewing machine division. The redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine, including a japanned case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate the carriage return. The typewriter, however, had been rushed into production with insufficient testing, and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair.|$|E
25|$|<b>Re-engineering</b> {{recognizes that}} an organization's {{business}} processes are usually fragmented into sub-processes and {{tasks that are}} carried out by several specialized functional areas within the organization. Often, no one {{is responsible for the}} overall performance of the entire process. Reengineering maintains that optimizing the performance of sub-processes can result in some benefits, but cannot yield dramatic improvements if the process itself is fundamentally inefficient and outmoded. For that reason, <b>re-engineering</b> focuses on re-designing the process as a whole in order to achieve the greatest possible benefits to the organization and their customers. This drive for realizing dramatic improvements by fundamentally re-thinking how the organization's work should be done distinguishes the <b>re-engineering</b> from process improvement efforts that focus on functional or incremental improvement.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} {{needs analysis}} contributes tremendously to the <b>re-engineering</b> effort by helping the BPR team to prioritize and determine {{where it should}} focus its improvements efforts.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{framework}} of this basic assessment of mission and goals, <b>re-engineering</b> focuses on the organization's business processes—the steps and procedures that govern how resources are used to create products and services that {{meet the needs of}} particular customers or markets. As a structured ordering of work steps across time and place, a business process can be decomposed into specific activities, measured, modeled, and improved. It can also be completely redesigned or eliminated altogether. <b>Re-engineering</b> identifies, analyzes, and re-designs an organization's core business processes with the aim of achieving dramatic improvements in critical performance measures, such as cost, quality, service, and speed.|$|E
25|$|Business Process <b>Re-engineering</b> (launched by Michael Hammer in 1993): a {{business}} management strategy {{focusing on the}} analysis and design of workflows and business processes within an organization. BPR seeks to help companies radically restructure their organizations {{by focusing on the}} ground-up design of their business processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{units in}} Technopark include {{domestic}} firms, joint ventures and subsidiaries of foreign companies {{engaged in a}} wide variety of activities, which include embedded software development, smart card technology, enterprise resource planning (ERP), process control software design, engineering and computer-aided design software development, IT Enabled Services (ITES), process <b>re-engineering,</b> animation and e-business.|$|E
25|$|Axiomatic {{design is}} a top down {{hierarchical}} functional decomposition process used as a solution synthesis framework for the analysis, development, <b>re-engineering,</b> and integration of products, information systems, business processes or software engineering solutions. Its structure is suited mathematically to analyze coupling between functions in order to optimize the architectural robustness of potential functional solution models.|$|E
25|$|These {{and other}} {{changes to the}} {{original}} concept led to considerable schedule pressures. The entire car was deemed to require almost complete <b>re-engineering,</b> which {{was turned over to}} engineer Colin Chapman, founder and owner of Lotus Cars. Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.|$|E
25|$|IDEF0 is a {{function}} modeling methodology for describing manufacturing functions, which offers {{a function}}al modeling language for the analysis, development, <b>re-engineering,</b> and integration of information systems; business processes; or software engineering analysis. It {{is part of the}} IDEF family of modeling languages in the field of software engineering, and is built on the functional modeling language building SADT.|$|E
25|$|BPR {{seeks to}} help {{companies}} radically restructure their organizations {{by focusing on}} the ground-up design of their business processes. According to Davenport (1990) a business process is a set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome. <b>Re-engineering</b> emphasized a holistic focus on business objectives and how processes related to them, encouraging full-scale recreation of processes rather than iterative optimization of sub-processes.|$|E
25|$|Practitioners {{of system}} {{analysis}} are often {{called up to}} dissect systems that have grown haphazardly to determine the current components of the system. This was shown during the year 2000 <b>re-engineering</b> effort as business and manufacturing processes were examined {{as part of the}} Y2K automation upgrades. Employment utilizing system analysis include system analyst, business analyst, manufacturing engineer, system architect, enterprise architect, software architect, etc.|$|E
25|$|By {{integrating}} {{synthetic biology}} approaches with materials sciences, {{it would be}} possible to envision cells as microscopic molecular foundries to produce materials with properties that can be genetically encoded. Recent advances towards this include the <b>re-engineering</b> of curli fibers, the amyloid component of extracellular material of biofilms, as a platform for programmable nanomaterial. These nanofibers have been genetically constructed for specific functions, including: adhesion to substrates; nanoparticle templating; and protein immobilization.|$|E
25|$|Business Process Reengineering (BPR) {{began as}} a private sector {{technique}} to help organizations fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors. A key stimulus for <b>re-engineering</b> has been the continuing development and deployment of sophisticated information systems and networks. Leading organizations are becoming bolder in using this technology to support innovative business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work.|$|E
25|$|Legislation and <b>re-engineering</b> of {{interconnected}} crossings {{across the}} state of Illinois combined with greater awareness elsewhere resulted in efforts to help to prevent similar crashes from recurring. Informational decals were also added to Illinois school buses advising drivers {{of the length of}} each bus, since the substitute school bus driver was apparently unaware of the exact length of the bus she was driving. Other states have also embraced that and related aspects and incorporated them into their school bus driver training curriculum.|$|E
25|$|They require {{long-term}} planning, massive {{investment in}} redesigning and <b>re-engineering,</b> collective input, husbanding resources, social investment in research for long-term sustainability, and major conservation efforts...Various approaches blame the victims. Supposedly {{the only solution}} is to change individual consumer choices, since people in general are claimed to cause the problem. But consumers, workers, and poor people don't have any say in energy plant construction, in decisions about trade or plant relocation or job export, in deciding on tax subsidies to polluting industries like the oil industry.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, in {{response}} to the recommendations made by the 1921 Royal Commission on the matter of uniform railway gauge, VR announced a policy that all new locomotive designs were to be capable of conversion from broad to standard gauge. The rationale was that the task of converting VR from broad to standard gauge at a future date would be far easier to achieve if the existing locomotives and rolling stock could be easily modified for standard gauge operation, rather than requiring expensive <b>re-engineering</b> or replacement.|$|E
25|$|This simpler {{design is}} a popular image on In-N-Out ads and artwork, which often shows classic cars such as 1965 Mustangs and 1968 Firebirds visiting the {{original}} restaurants. The original Covina restaurant, located on Arrow Highway west of Grand Avenue, was forced to close in the early 1990s due to <b>re-engineering</b> {{and development of the}} area. A modern design, drive-up/dining room restaurant was built a few hundred feet away. The new building is much larger (approximately half the size of the entire lot upon which the earlier restaurant sat), and is often filled to capacity.|$|E
25|$|Although the C1 Corvette chassis and {{suspension}} design {{were derived}} from Chevrolet's full-size cars, the same basic design was continued through the 1962 model even after the full-size cars were completely redesigned for the 1955 model year. This {{was due to the}} combined factors of the relatively high <b>re-engineering</b> and re-tooling costs for this low-volume production vehicle, the continued potential for cancellation of the car, and the increased size and weight of the all-new suspension design for the full-size cars, which made it unsuitable for use in the lighter weight Corvette.|$|E
25|$|The K class 2-8-0 {{built by}} VR in 1922-23 was a success, {{but with a}} firebox mounted between frames {{engineered}} for broad gauge operation only, it was not readily gauge-convertible. Thus when additional branch line locomotives were required, the VR produced a 2-8-2 'Mikado' variant of the K, the first 2-8-2 tender engine in Australia. It retained the same wheels, cylinders, motion, {{and much of the}} frame of the K, but featured a longer boiler with a wider, larger grate, mounted above the frames and supported by a trailing truck. This enabled possible gauge conversion without radical <b>re-engineering</b> of the frames and grate.|$|E
25|$|The Taylor Family Digital Library (TFDL) is a {{convergence}} of libraries, historical archives, arts museum, scholarly publishing, and student academic support services. The TFDL was officially launched on October 20, 2011. The TFDL allows the full <b>re-engineering</b> of the university's library system, creating more and better space for teaching and learning resources, while moving {{the majority of the}} University of Calgary's growing collection off campus to a high-density library. In addition, The TFDL offers books and online resources, a large Learning Commons with café, workrooms, film and audio rooms, editing and recording suites, multimedia labs, quiet study areas, and seminar and consultation space for academic growth.|$|E
25|$|During the September 11, 2001, {{attacks on}} the World Trade Center, FBI agent Leonard W. Hatton Jr. was killed during the rescue effort while helping the rescue {{personnel}} evacuate the occupants of the South Tower, and he stayed when it collapsed. Within months after the attacks, FBI Director Robert Mueller, who had been sworn in {{a week before the}} attacks, called for a <b>re-engineering</b> of FBI structure and operations. He made countering every federal crime a top priority, including the prevention of terrorism, countering foreign intelligence operations, addressing cyber security threats, other high-tech crimes, protecting civil rights, combating public corruption, organized crime, white-collar crime, and major acts of violent crime.|$|E
25|$|Brunel did {{not live}} to see the bridge finished, {{although}} his colleagues and admirers at the Institution of Civil Engineers felt it would be a fitting memorial, and started to raise new funds and to amend the design. Work recommenced in 1862 and was completed in 1864, five years after Brunel's death. In 2011 it was suggested, by historian and biographer Adrian Vaughan, that Brunel did not design the bridge, as eventually built, as the later changes to its design were substantial. His views reflected a sentiment stated fifty two years earlier by Tom Rolt in his 1959 book Brunel. <b>Re-engineering</b> of suspension chains recovered from an earlier suspension bridge was one of many reasons given why Brunel's design could not be followed exactly.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this {{approach}} is the slum upgrade in Tondo slum near Manila, Philippines. The project was anticipated to be complete in four years, but it took nine. There was a large increase in cost, numerous delays, <b>re-engineering</b> of details to address political disputes, and other complications after the project. Despite these failures, the project reaffirmed the core assumption and Tondo families did build their own houses of far better quality than originally assumed. Tondo residents became property owners with a stake in their neighborhood. A more recent example of slum-upgrading approach is PRIMED initiative in Medellin, Colombia, where streets, Metrocable transportation and other public infrastructure has been added. These slum infrastructure upgrades were combined with city infrastructure upgrade such as addition of metro, paved roads and highways to empower all city residents including the poor with reliable access throughout city.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to curb the {{increasing}} engine power levels of recent years, the maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.0 to 2.4 litres {{and the number of}} cylinders from 10 to 8. At similar engine speeds, the change was expected to cut peak power by around 200bhp, which would equate to around three to five seconds on lap times at most circuits. (Scuderia Toro Rosso continued to use 3.0 litre 10-cylinder engines with both rev and air-intake limiters to avoid the costs of <b>re-engineering</b> their cars in a short period). Initial testing indicated the new engines were six seconds slower than their V10 counterparts, but early in the season it became obvious that despite the decrease in power, lap times were not far from 2005 figures; on some circuits, the fastest laps set this year were actually faster than the ones recorded last year, with the V10 engines.|$|E
25|$|Those in {{opposition}} of dam removal state that demolishing O'Shaughnessy Dam {{would take away}} a valuable source of clean, renewable hydroelectric power in the Kirkwood and Moccasin powerhouses; even if measures such as seasonal water diversion into the powerhouses were employed, it would only make up {{for a fraction of}} the original power production. The remaining deficit would likely have to be replaced by polluting fossil fuel generation. The removal of the dam would be extremely costly, at least $3–10 billion, and the transport of the demolished material away from the dam site along the narrow, winding Hetch Hetchy Road would be a logistical nightmare with possible environmental impacts. Most importantly, San Francisco would lose its source of high-quality mountain water, and would have to depend on lower-quality water from other reservoirs – which would require costly filtration and <b>re-engineering</b> of the aqueduct system – to meet its needs.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of Deception was the emphasis on online gameplay, which had yet to become common for console fighting games. A team of engineers took almost a full year to decide if the feature was viable. The MK team focused their energies solely on platforms that had strong online functionality available to the end consumer; {{this led to a}} greater focus on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions. Because the GameCube games require some <b>re-engineering</b> compared to the other platforms when porting, it was decided to exclude the GameCube from the work of the team until the online hurdles were cleared. Some time after the game's release, Boon commented that he was disappointed that the GameCube version did not feature online gameplay as he regarded it as [...] "the best in the business".|$|E
500|$|In the United States {{the cost}} of {{certification}} for mass-produced items is typically minuscule, and is usually more than offset by the advantages of being certified. In 1975 The New York Times estimated the cost per item for obtaining kosher certification at 6.5 millionths of a cent ($0.000000065) per item for a General Foods frozen-food item. According to a 2005 report by Burns & McDonnell, most US national certifying agencies are non-profit, only charging for supervision and on-site work, for which the on-site supervisor [...] "typically makes less per visit than an auto mechanic does per hour". However, <b>re-engineering</b> an existing manufacturing process can be costly. Certification usually leads to increased revenues by opening up additional markets to Jews who keep kosher, Muslims who keep halal, Seventh-day Adventists who keep the main laws of Kosher Diet, vegetarians, and the lactose-intolerant who wish to avoid dairy products (products that are reliably certified as pareve meet this criterion). According to the Orthodox Union, {{one of the largest}} kashrut organizations in the United States, [...] "when positioned next to a competing non-kosher brand, a kosher product will do better by 20%".|$|E
