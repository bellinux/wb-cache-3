5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher <b>reproductive</b> <b>success</b> than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate. Sexual selection {{is strong enough to}} allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the American white ibis gathers in huge colonies near water. Pairs are predominantly monogamous and both parents {{care for the}} young, although males tend to engage in extra-pair copulation with other females to increase their <b>reproductive</b> <b>success.</b> Males have also been found to pirate food from unmated females and juveniles during {{the breeding}} season.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} uses social cues in its {{evaluation}} and choice of nesting sites. In particular, it listens to the post-breeding songs given out by other males. These songs have strong temporal dependencies. Males sing {{at the beginning and}} the peak of breeding season, but songs are not indicative of <b>reproductive</b> <b>success.</b> Near the end of a breeding season, a male that has successfully mated continues to sing while a male that has failed to reproduce abandons the habitat. Therefore, post-breeding songs are reliable indicators of <b>reproductive</b> <b>success</b> within the particular habitat and convey essential information to the natal and breeding dispersers. In comparison to the traditional idea of direct assessment of the vegetation structure, the vocal cue is much more efficient and easier to obtain, hence revealing the advantage of social communication in survival and reproduction. A female, however, does not respond to post-breeding songs directly. Instead, she is likely to rely on the presence of males in deciding nesting sites.|$|E

5000|$|Males’ <b>reproductive</b> <b>successes</b> {{are often}} limited by access to mates, whereas females’ <b>reproductive</b> <b>successes</b> {{are more often}} limited by access to resources. Thus, for a given sexual encounter, it will benefit the male to mate but the female to be choosy and resist. [...] For example, male small {{tortoiseshell}} butterfly will compete {{in order to gain}} the best territory to mate. [...] Another example of this conflict {{can be found in the}} Eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica. Males of this species are limited in reproduction primarily by access to mates, so they will claim a territory and wait for a female to pass through. Big males are, therefore, more successful in mating because they claim territories near the female nesting sites that are more sought after. Smaller males, on the other hand, will monopolize less competitive sites in foraging areas so that they may mate with reduced conflict.|$|R
25|$|The {{inclusive}} fitness theory {{provides a}} good overview of possible solutions to the fundamental problem of cooperation: its contradiction to natural selection. The theory {{is based on the}} hypothesis that cooperation helps in transmitting underlying genes to future generations either through increasing the <b>reproductive</b> <b>successes</b> of the individual (direct fitness) or of other individuals who carry the same genes (indirect fitness). Direct benefits can result from simple by-product of cooperation or enforcement mechanisms, while indirect benefits can result from cooperation with genetically similar individuals.|$|R
5|$|This nuthatch, {{like most}} of its genus, is non-migratory, and the adults {{normally}} stay in their territory year-round. There may be more noticeable dispersal due to seed failure or high <b>reproductive</b> <b>success</b> in some years, and this species has occurred as a vagrant to Vancouver Island, Santa Cruz Island, and Bermuda. One bird landed on the RMS Queen Mary six hours sailing east of New York City in October 1963.|$|E
5|$|When {{vineyards}} in the south-west Cape started letting weeds grow between vines {{to conserve}} moisture, around 1956, the Cape sparrow moved in. Cape sparrows quickly exhausted {{the seeds and}} started eating the grapes. The Cape sparrow is now a serious pest in vineyards. However, vineyards are not optimal habitat: some populations have had such a low <b>reproductive</b> <b>success</b> {{that they could not}} be maintained without immigration.|$|E
5|$|A {{special case}} of natural {{selection}} is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher <b>reproductive</b> <b>success</b> in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} indices {{proposed to}} predict the evolution of mating systems, a unified measure of sexual selection has remained elusive. Three previous studies have compared indices of sexual selection under laboratory conditions. Here, we use a genetic study to compare {{the most widely used}} measures of sexual selection in natural populations. We explored the mating and <b>reproductive</b> <b>successes</b> of male and female bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus, across manipulated operational sex ratios (OSRs) by genotyping all adult and pup bank voles on 13 islands using six microsatellite loci. We used Bateman's principles (I(s) and I and Bateman gradients) and selection coefficients (s' and beta') to evaluate, for the first time, the genetic mating system of bank voles and compared these measures with alternative indices of sexual selection (index of monopolization and Morisita's index) across the OSRs. We found that all the sexual selection indices show significant positive intercorrelations for both males and females, suggesting that Bateman's principles are an accurate and a valid measure of the mating system. The Bateman gradient, in particular, provides information over and above that of other sexual selection indices. Male bank voles show a greater potential for sexual selection than females, and Bateman gradients indicate a polygynandrous mating system. Selection coefficients reveal strong selection gradients on male bank vole plasma testosterone level rather than body size...|$|R
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{are both}} monogamous and polygamous; although broods are generally {{brought up by}} one male and one female, occasionally the pair may have an extra helper.

5|$|In {{the study}} of natural selection, the {{population}} of Soay sheep that remain {{on the island of}} Hirta have been used to explore the relation of body size and coloration to <b>reproductive</b> <b>success.</b> Soay sheep come in several colors, and researchers investigated why the larger, darker sheep were in decline; this occurrence contradicted the rule of thumb that larger members of a population tend to be more successful reproductively. The feral Soays on Hirta are especially useful subjects because they are isolated.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar females reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{about two years}} of age, and males at three or four.

Research on captive male jaguars supports the year-round mating hypothesis, with no seasonal variation in semen traits and ejaculatory quality; low <b>reproductive</b> <b>success</b> has also been observed in captivity. Female estrus is 6–17 days out of a full 37-day cycle, and females will advertise fertility with urinary scent marks and increased vocalization.

40|$|The {{brain of}} each animal shows {{specific}} traits that reflect its phylogenetic history and its particular lifestyle. Therefore, comparing brains {{is not just}} a mere intellectual exercise, but it helps understanding how the brain allows adaptive behavioural strategies to face an ever-changing world and how this complex organ has evolved during phylogeny, giving rise to complex mental processes in humans and other animals. These questions attracted scientists since the times of Santiago Ramon y Cajal {{one of the founders of}} comparative neurobiology. In the last decade, this discipline has undergone a true revolution due to the analysis of expression patterns of morphogenetic genes in embryos of different animals. The papers of this e-book are good examples of modern comparative neurobiology, which mainly focuses on the following four Grand Questions: a) How are different brains built during ontogeny?b) What is the anatomical organization of mature brains and how can they be compared?c) How do brains work to accomplish their function of ensuring survival and, ultimately, <b>reproductive</b> <b>success?d)</b> How have brains evolved during phylogeny? The title of this e-book, Adaptive Function and Brain Evolution, stresses the importance of comparative studies to understand brain function and, the reverse, of considering brain function to properly understand brain evolution. These issues should be taken into account when using animals in the research of mental function and dysfunction, and are fundamental to understand the origins of the human mind...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTherapeutic cloning {{or nuclear}} {{transfer}} for stem cells (NTSC) seeks to overcome immune rejection {{through the development}} of embryonic stem cells (ES cells) derived from cloned blastocysts. The successful derivation of a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line from blastocysts generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) provides proof-of-principle for “therapeutic cloning,” though immune matching of the differentiated NT-hES remains to be established. Here, in nonhuman primates (NHPs; rhesus and cynomologus macaques), the strategies used with human SCNT improve NHP-SCNT development significantly. Protocol improvements include the following: enucleation just prior to metaphase-II arrest; extrusion rather than extraction of the meiotic spindle-chromosome complex (SCC); nuclear transfer by electrofusion with simultaneous cytoplast activation; and sequential media. Embryo transfers (ET) of 135 SCNT-NHP into 25 staged surrogates did not result in convincing evidence of pregnancies after 30 days post-ET. These results demonstrate that (i) protocols optimized in humans generate preimplantation embryos in nonhuman primates; (ii) some, though perhaps not yet all, hurdles in deriving NT-nhpES cells from cloned macaque embryos (therapeutic cloning) have been overcome; (iii) reproductive cloning with SCNT-NHP embryos appears significantly less efficient than with fertilized embryos; (iv) therapeutic cloning with matured metaphase-II oocytes, aged oocytes, or “fertilization failures” might remain difficult since enucleation is optimally performed prior to metaphase-II arrest; and (v) challenges remain for producing <b>reproductive</b> <b>successes</b> since NT embryos appear inferior to fertilized ones due to spindle defects resulting from centrosome and motor deficiencies that produce aneuploid preimplantation embryos, among other anomalies including genomic imprinting, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic heterogeneities, cell cycle asynchronies, and improper nuclear reprogramming...|$|R
40|$|Fig {{trees and}} their pollinating fig wasps {{represent}} {{one of the}} most species-specific mutualistic systems with a long history of co-evolution. Besides the pollinators, figs are also exploited by numerous non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFW). A few fig trees have become established outside their native ranges, and Ficus microcarpa, a monoecious fig tree, has become widely invasive, due to the widespread introduction of its specific pollinator, Eupristina verticillata. In this thesis, a global study was carried out to unravel the distribution and community structure of fig wasps associated with F. microcarpa. The work also examined which NPFW are potential bio-control agents and whether the plant is invasive due to reduced seed and pollinator predation in its introduced range (the 'enemy release' hypothesis). At least 43 fig wasp species utilize F. microcarpa figs with more than 20 species present in the plant's introduced range. In newly established NPFW populations, a lack of male fig wasps at low population densities can cause Allee-like effects for fig wasps, but inter-specific facilitation is able to mitigate them. Generally, parasitoids were far less diverse than phytophages in the tree's introduced range with significant latitudinal effects on species richness. We unraveled the food web of fig wasps where sycoryctines (Pteromalidae) were parasitoids of agaonids, and eurytomids were parasitoids of epichrysomallines. A large galler species, Meselatus bicolor, is independent of the pollinator and can suppress both male and female <b>reproductive</b> <b>successes</b> of figs via competition for nutrients and preventing pollinators from entering figs. It may be an ideal bio-control agent. Enemy release in the introduced range failed to increase the plant's seed production but benefited the pollinator, and the greater survival of pollinator larvae in more peripheral galls emphasises the role of parasitoids in maintaining the fig-pollinator mutualism in monoecious figs...|$|R
5|$|Pairs may {{breed in}} {{isolation}} or in loose colonies, and will readily use nest boxes. In a Spanish study, boxes {{made from a}} mixture of wood and concrete (woodcrete) had a much higher occupancy rate than wooden boxes (76.5% versus 33.5%), and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season. Clutch size and chick condition did not differ between nest box types, but <b>reproductive</b> <b>success</b> was higher in woodcrete, perhaps because the synthetic nests were 1.5°C warmer than their wooden counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Prey {{mobility}} {{could also}} explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics {{that make them}} more exposed to predators, such as when some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then they have more reason to develop aposematism.

Thus, aposematism {{is not merely a}} signaling system, but a way for organisms to gain greater access to resources and increase their <b>reproductive</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pupae {{have the}} ability to enter facultative diapause, the state of arrested {{development}} and growth in response to a change in the environment.

Percentages of good perinatal outcome (live birth of a term [at or after 37 weeks of gestation], normal birth weight [2, 500 g or greater] singleton) were stratified by prognosis (favorable, average, less favorable), age, embryo stage (day 3, day 5), and number of embryos transferred.

40|$|Species {{in which}} sexual {{selection}} acts more strongly on females than on males provide interesting opportunities {{to study the}} evolution of sex roles and sex differences {{and the impact of}} exposure to endocrine disruptors. The sex-role-reversed Gulf pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli) is sexually dimorphic, and females possess dramatic secondary sexual traits while males are choosy. Experiments involving endocrine disruptors have previously illustrated that the secondary sexual traits in female pipefish are estrogen-regulated, but no studies before this dissertation had yet addressed the effects of endocrine disruptors on the strength of sexual selection or the hormonal regulation of a sexually dimorphic transcriptome in any sex-role-reversed taxon. When exposed to low, ecologically relevant concentrations of 17 ?-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) of 2 ng/L, female pipefish had greater <b>reproductive</b> <b>successes</b> which resulted in an increase in sexual selection acting on exposed females. However, at minimally higher and still ecologically-relevant EE 2 concentrations (5 ng/L), male pipefish were unable to receive eggs or maintain their pregnancies, ceasing the reproduction of the exposed fishes. Understanding the evolutionary consequences of exposure to endocrine disruptors at several concentrations is important to help predict the effects that endocrine disruptors will have on the fecundity and sustainability of exposed natural populations. Using next-generation RNA-sequencing technology, I compared gene expression patterns in the livers of pipefish females, pregnant males, and non-pregnant males exposed to EE 2 at ecologically relevant concentrations of 5 ng/L. The results showed that the control Gulf pipefish liver transcriptomes showed sexually dimorphic patterns of gene expression, indicating that this sex-role-reversed pipefish species {{does not appear to have}} an endocrine reversal from the typical gene expression patterns found in the livers of most fishes with conventional sex roles. Estrogen exposure did cause feminization of gene expression patterns in the male liver transcriptome, with several of the EE 2 responsive genes shown to have female-biased expression in control animals. These genes included several of the classic estrogen biomarkers, such as vitellogenin, choriogenin, and zona pellucida transcripts. Overall, exposure to synthetic estrogen has been shown to have a strong effect on selection, reproductive abilities, and hepatic gene expression levels in the sex-role-reversed Gulf pipefish...|$|R

By not restricting the number of females it copulates with, the male is able to increase its <b>reproductive</b> <b>success</b> considerably.
