40|$|Introduction: This study {{covers the}} design of ground facilities, or metroports, for a future form of short haul {{intercity}} air transportation, the VTOL Airbus system as described by previous M. I. T. Flight Transportation Laboratory reports. This system will use VTOL aircraft, such as compound helicopters or tilt wings, which will operate from metroports sited throughout a metropolitan region, and will provide frequent service between the regions which make up an urban corridor, or megalopolis. The metroports are conceived as relatively compact installations placed in city center areas and at major <b>roadway</b> <b>junctions</b> throughout the surrounding suburban region. By providing shorter access and egress times for short haul passengers, and by avoiding airport taxi times and delays due to congestion, the Airbus service will offer substantially improved megalopolitan travel times at total costs {{comparable to those of}} the present air system. The service will be all weather, night and day, using its own airspace at the metroports, and a segregated airspace when the metroport is co-located with an airport. The trip lengths will vary between 30 - 300 miles, which would include travel generated by business commuters in the corridor region, and the travel arising from collecting and distributing the long haul air passenger to and from the major airports in the corridor. Previous systems engineering studies discovered that the ground facilities for such a VTOL system are easily the most important component. The usual predominance of the design and operation of the air vehicle did not hold for this new system, since the ground operations costs were projected to be much higher, and at least twice as much investment was expected to be required for new ground facilities as for new vehicles. Additionally, the time savings offered by the system were far more sensitive to the number and distribution of metroports than to vehicle speed.

40|$|Abstract:-Ramp {{metering}} {{has been}} {{emerged as an}} effective freeway control approach to ensure efficient freeway operations. The performance of ramp metering depends on various factors, such as traffic flow, downstream traffic conditions, and queue override policy. This paper proposes a linear approach for designing local demand-capacity ramp controls using simulation model. This study investigates the macroscopic simulation equation models of ramp metering signal timing plan on the freeway and separated connecting collector-distributor <b>roadway</b> of the <b>junction</b> section on Taiwan National Freeway Systems. The main analysis {{will be based on}} these driver behaviors including compulsive lane-changing and about 50 % weaving activities on the separated connecting collector-distributor roadway. The ramp metering control is to optimize freeway mainline traffic by providing metering rates for accesses within the control segments. The results of this study show that well-designed ramp metering control not only increase the freeway mainline traffic flows and speed, but also prevents traffic breakdown...|$|R

Above the first floor, the steel-framed building was constructed to a cruciform plan and rises in a series of receding stages to a central clock tower 175 ft tall. The arrangement maximises daylight to the building's interior without the use of light wells. Like his stations of the period and his pre-First World War commercial buildings, the block is austerely clad in Portland stone. Holden again detailed the façades with commissioned sculptures; , two compositions by Epstein, are at first floor level, and a series of eight bas-reliefs at the seventh floor represent the four winds (two for each of the cardinal directions, {{on each side of the}} projecting wings). The building is Grade I listed.|$|R
50|$|The {{first state}} {{roads in the}} Park City area were {{designated}} in 1910, and met at Kamas Junction, a three-way intersection at , now located between the Jordanelle Reservoir and the present alignment of SR-248 in Jordanelle State Park. One of these highways headed west to Park City Junction, north to Kimball Junction, and west to Salt Lake City, generally following the present SR-248, SR-224, and I-80. Another went east to Kamas and then north via Wanship to Echo near the present SR-248, SR-32, and I-80, and the third went south to Heber City through the valley now flooded by the reservoir and along US-40. A cutoff from Kimball Junction east to Wanship, added in 1917, shortened the distance between Salt Lake City and Echo. The State Road Commission assigned route numbers in the 1920s, with SR-4 (later US-530 east of Kimball Junction) running via Salt Lake City, Kimball Junction, Wanship, and Echo, and SR-6 (later US-40) splitting at Kimball Junction and running via Park City Junction, Kamas Junction, and Heber City. The <b>roadway</b> from Kamas <b>Junction</b> to Wanship via Kamas did not receive a number until 1927, when the state legislature labeled the Kamas Junction-Kamas portion as State Route 34 and the remainder as part of SR-35, which continued southeast from Kamas to Tabiona. At that time, the present extent of SR-248 - Park City Junction to Kamas — was part of SR-6 (US-40) and all of SR-34.|$|R

5000|$|... 1940 - During the Norwegian Campaign, the Germans {{recognized}} this rail, <b>roadway</b> and telegraph <b>junction</b> was strategically significant. From 13 April on the Germans started receiving messages of imminent allied action in Norway through {{the port of}} Åndalsnes. To counter this the German High Command ordered a takeover of Dombås. The result was that a company of fallschirmjägers from 1st battalion of the 1st Regiment, 7th Flieger Division was dropped at Dombås on 14 April, intending to cut the rail line. The German company had the misfortune to jump straight onto the second battalion of Infantry Regiment no. 11 (Møre) that was bivouaced at Dombås {{on their way to}} the front north of Oslo. In the second opposed paratrooper attack in history (the first being the one made against Sola Air Station on 9 April) only seven out of fifteen Junkers Ju 52s made it back to their base at Fornebu airport the rest were lost to Norwegian Colt M/29 anti-aircraft machine gun fire, dispersing the paratroopers. Most of the surviving paratroopers were taken prisoner soon after landing. Only a single group of sixty-three Germans, under the company commander Oberleutnant Herbert Schmidt managed to avoid capture and sealed off the Gudbrandsdal valley holed up in two strategically placed farms. Only on 19 April did the isolated group of Germans surrender, having been surrounded by far superior Norwegian forces for five days. On 16 April the Norwegians brought two mortars and several Colt M/29 heavy machine guns to bear on Schmidt's men and from 18 April a 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft gun bombarded the German positions from Dombås Railway Station. On 19 April the paratroopers could no longer stand the bombardment and sent forward the captured Norwegian Major Kjøs to convey their surrender message. All in all 150 fallschirmjägers ended up in Norwegian captivity, being kept in a prisoner-of-war camp near Kristiansund until released when resistance collapsed in South Norway in early May.|$|R
