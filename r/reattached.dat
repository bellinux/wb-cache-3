5|$|During this period, Thordendal, who {{was working}} as a carpenter, severed the tip of his left middle finger, while Haake injured his hand in a router accident. As a result, the band was unable to perform for several months. Thordendal's {{fingertip}} was later <b>reattached,</b> and he went on to make a full recovery. The Selfcaged EP was recorded in April and May 1994, but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to the accidents.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the weight-reduction phase had {{included}} removing the anchors from the battleship, but Wallin ordered {{one of the}} anchors to be <b>reattached.</b> His reason for doing so was that the anchor would effectively shift Missouris center of gravity forward to a narrower part of the battleship, thereby reducing the friction at her widest point. During this time, the Bureau of Ships offered valuable technical and salvage advice to both the civilian and military participants in the salvage effort.|$|E
5|$|In April, the 2nd Ranger Infantry Company was <b>reattached</b> to the 7th Infantry Division, {{this time}} to the 31st Regimental Combat Team. The company spent the month {{training}} replacements, with up to 400 enlisted men filtering into the company. By May, the process of transferring these men to other units began as U.S. Army units throughout Korea, driven by necessity, began slowly desegregating. The Rangers eventually settled at a force of 123 men, among them the first white member of the unit, medic Joe Russo.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out on the flapping motion of a turbulent <b>reattaching</b> shear layer downstream of a two-dimensional backward-facing step. The Reynolds number was 2. 0 x 104, based on the free-stream velocity and the step height. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the flapping motion, which is featured unsteadiness of the <b>reattaching</b> shear layer, and its interaction with the recirculation region. High-resolution planar particle image velocimetry was used to measure the separated and <b>reattaching</b> shear layer in a horizontal-vertical plane. The velocity vector fields have shown the <b>reattaching</b> shear layer considerably flaps upwards and downwards as much in scale as approximately one step height from the middle part of recirculation region to the reattachment area. As a result, the recirculation region varies in size and the reattachment point shifts upstream and downstream. By applying singular value decomposition and proper orthogonal decomposition, the flapping motion is decomposed into multiple spatial rnodes, each of which represents interactions between the <b>reattaching</b> shear layer and recirculation region. In particular, the unsteady movement of the reattachment point is highly correlated with the flapping motion, and so is the maximum reverse flow. As a result, the flapping motion contributes substantial parts of the Reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy within the shear layer in the lauer half of the reattachment lengt...|$|R
5|$|In November 1978, Armstrong {{was working}} at his farm near Lebanon, Ohio. As he jumped off {{of the back of}} his grain truck, his wedding ring got caught in the wheel, tearing off the tip of his left hand's ring finger. He {{collected}} the severed digit and packed it in ice, and surgeons <b>reattached</b> it at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. In February 1991, a year after his father had died, and nine months {{after the death of his}} mother, he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing with friends at Aspen, Colorado.|$|E
5|$|The division, now <b>reattached</b> to II ANZAC Corps, moved {{north in}} mid-October and {{replaced}} the 5th Australian Division at Sailly. It remained here, patrolling the sector and mounting raids, into February 1917. The {{men of the}} division had become fatigued through their service on the Western Front. While the 2nd and Rifle Brigades soon recovered, the 1st Brigade, having many Gallipoli veterans, continued to struggle as did Johnston, its commander. Consequently, Russell sent him on leave and reorganised the brigades.|$|E
5|$|King Memorial Fountain is a {{fountain}} erected in 1893 with a monumental bronze statue of Moses smiting the rock for water on Mount Horeb. Four figures of Israelite slaves around the statue {{on the side}} of the mountain represent the four stages of life: infancy, youth, adulthood, and old age. The fountain is in the center of formal gardens laid out by William S. Egerton. It was a gift from Rufus H. King and was sculpted by J. Massey Rhind, who also sculpted the Philip Schuyler statue that stands at the center of the intersection of Eagle Street and Washington Avenue in front of city hall. In 1988, the statue of Moses was cleaned and applied with a wax coating to protect it from the weather, and an arm was <b>reattached</b> to one of the four other statues on the fountain.|$|E

5|$|Quagmire {{returns home}} from a holiday in Florida and comes to the Griffins' house to tell Peter that he has smuggled some {{fireworks}} into Quahog by hiding them in his anus. Peter tells him that fireworks aren't illegal in Quahog, so he didn't need to hide them and could have just brought them in normally, but Quagmire doesn't see any fun in doing that. Later on, the Griffins and Quagmire start {{to play with the}} fireworks. Peter attaches ten M-80s together and shows Quagmire, but they explode, detaching all the fingers from his right hand. With Joe's help, Peter is able to find his fingers and later gets them <b>reattached</b> to his hand. The next day, Peter celebrates getting his fingers <b>reattached</b> by going to The Drunken Clam with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire, and they decide to continue their celebrations at Pawtucket Brewery after the bar closes. Peter is behind on his work at the brewery, as he is unable to type due to his hand injury, and Angela threatens him with the prospect of being fired if he fails to catch up, so he asks Lois to help him. When Lois agrees to help Peter catch up with his work, Peter attempts to seduce her numerous times. Later at the brewery, after a final attempt to seduce Lois in his office, she gives in and they have sex in front of their co-worker Opie, who runs away screaming. In the end, Peter is caught up with his work and enjoys having Lois help out and have sex with him.|$|E

5|$|By 1912, the use {{of horse}} and buggy {{had fallen out of}} fashion, and the Burnside Fountain saw little use in its {{intended}} purpose. By 1939 citizens of Worcester were already calling for the fountain to be moved to a more suitable place where it could be of more use. It took until 1969 for the Burnside Fountain to be moved from Central Square. It was relocated to the Worcester Common and turned to face Salem Square. One year later, in May 1970, the statue was ripped from its pedestal and stolen. It was returned later that same year, but it took until 1972 for the boy and turtle to be placed back on top of the basin. Another apparent theft attempt happened in 2004 when the bronze sculpture was toppled off its pedestal and left dangling off the basin. The city was quick to fix the statue this time, with it being righted and <b>reattached</b> within days.|$|E

5|$|During the night, Pyrrhus {{was able}} to enter Argos. While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force, Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas. Hammond opines {{that it is more}} likely that Aristeas {{admitted}} Pyrrhus into the city. Although Pyrrhus' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive agora, the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate. In order for them to enter, the towers need to be taken off their backs and <b>reattached</b> once they were inside the city. Furthermore, Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the city walls under the command of his son Helenus. This delay gave the Argives enough time to reach their citadel, the Aspis, and seek aid from Antigonus. The Macedonian king responded immediately, advancing towards the city walls and sending a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus.|$|E
5|$|The first {{identification}} of Plymouth Rock as the actual landing site was in 1741 by 90-year-old Thomas Faunce, whose father {{had arrived in}} Plymouth in 1623, {{three years after the}} supposed event. The rock was later covered by a solid-fill pier. In 1774, an attempt was made to excavate the rock, but it broke in two. The severed piece was placed in the Town Square at the center of Plymouth. In 1880, the intact half of the rock was excavated from the pier, and the broken piece was <b>reattached</b> to it. Over the years, souvenir hunters have removed chunks from the rock, but the remains are now protected as part of the complex of living museums. These include the Mayflower II, a recreation of the original ship; Plimoth Plantation, a historical recreation of the original 1620 settlement; and the Wampanoag Homesite, which recreates a 17th-century Indian village.|$|E

30|$|A receiver's {{ability to}} <b>reattach</b> to the {{broadcast}} session falls exponentially {{with the number of}} broadcast packets it has missed since the last time it was attached. This allows a smooth tradeoff between the network's resilience to losses and its vulnerability to attackers: a trusted receiver that has lost some packets has the opportunity to <b>reattach,</b> but an attacker has limited time to compromise a key in the chain and attach it to the network (since old keys become exponentially less useful with time).|$|R
40|$|An {{unsteady}} {{numerical simulation}} was performed for locally forced separated and <b>reattaching</b> ow over a backward-facing step. The local forcing {{was given to}} the separated and <b>reattaching</b> ow by means of a sinusoidally oscillating jet from a separation line. A version of the k{{f model was employed, in which the near-wall behavior without reference to distance and the nonequilibrium eect in the recirculation region were incorporated. The Reynolds number based on the step height (H) was xed at ReH = 33000, and the forcing frequency was varied in the range 06 StH 62. The predicted results were compared and validated with the experimental data of Chun and Sung (1996, 1998).
