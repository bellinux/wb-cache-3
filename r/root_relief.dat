The gear design {{always be}} focus on {{analyzing}} the static performance (strength, stress, friction) and dynamic performance (inertia, noise, vibration), {{and especially for}} dynamic, the noise and vibration of gear are big problems. Actually, the main reason of noise and vibration is transmission error between master and slave gears, but the error must exist in any manufacture process. To decrease harmful noise and vibration, the most effective method is “tooth profile modification”, which is by tip relief or <b>root</b> <b>relief</b> for modifying geometry profile of gear tooth to regulate transmission error. In the paper, the transmission error of original model and modified model will be compared to show the gear profile modification will influence the transmission error obviously...|$|E
40|$|An {{original}} application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) is developed {{in order to}} optimize spur gear pairs toward vibrationand noise reduction. The approach {{takes into account the}} most important parameters of micro-geometric modifications,namely tip and <b>root</b> <b>relief,</b> therefore the parameter space is eight dimensional. The objective function of the GA depends onthe static transmission error (STE) that is related to teeth flexibility. STE is estimated by means of a nonlinear finite elementapproach: either the amplitude of the STE fluctuation or its harmonic content are considered as objective functions. The effectiveness of the approach is checked on an actual test case: GAs are able to find the optimum after a reasonablenumber of steps; such optimum is obtained on static basis and gives a strong vibration reduction. The reliability test provesthat GAs lead to robust optima...|$|E

Tae et al. (2001) discussed tooth modification for minimizing the vibration exiting force and noise in helical gears. Beghini et al. (2004) proposed a method to reduce the transmission error of spur gear at the normal torque through profile modification parameters. Satoshi et al. (1988) studied the effect of standard pressure angle on the bending strength of helical gears by using the approximate equation to a considerable extent. Satoshi et al. (1986) analyzed the tooth deflection and bending moment at the root fillet in helical gear for various pressure angles by finite difference method. Shan Chang et al. (2005) used tip relief and <b>root</b> <b>relief</b> to reduce the high contact stresses occur at the root corners in the entering and exiting regions. Alexander et al. (2003) presented a novel method for bending stress balance using one-hundred-year-old Lewis equation suggesting an approach to the tooth parameter’s tolerance and tooth profile definition.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} solving the contact problem for generic helical gear pairs (either {{external}} or inter- nal) is described. Gear profiles are obtained {{by means of}} numerical simulation of the cutting pro- cess and an accurate description is provided in terms of NURBS curves or surfaces. A new method for finding the enveloping profiles for a generic tool (e. g. from a measured topography) is pro- posed. The minimum number of parameters needed to describe the profile {{in the presence of}} tip and <b>root</b> <b>reliefs,</b> helix modification and crowning is discussed. A reference structured grid is de- fined on the tooth, then refinement criteria are applied in order to obtain accurate solutions in terms of tooth deflection, contact pressure and fillet stress. The method allows to automatically perform a Loaded Tooth Contact Analysis (LTCA) starting from the design data of a gear pair. Re- sults from the LTCA include contact pressure and contact pattern maps, as well as maximum fillet stress and fatigue strength. Combining several analyses within a mesh cycle, information about the Static Transmission Error (STE) and mesh stiffness is provided. The whole procedure has been implemented in a software called helical pair. A comparison with other approaches is given...|$|R

50|$|Placing engines on {{the wing}} {{provides}} beneficial wing bending relief in flight. The further the engines are away from the fuselage the greater the wing bending relief so engines buried in the wing <b>root</b> provide little <b>relief.</b> Almost all modern large jet airplanes use engines in pods located a significant distance from the wing root for substantial wing bending relief. The pods are {{in front of the}} wing to help avoid flutter of the wing which, in turn, allows a much lighter wing structure. Locating the pod below the wing provides each engine with air undisturbed by the fuselage or wing.|$|R

5000|$|It was not however {{until the}} 1980s that U.S. food banks began to enjoy rapid growth. A second {{response}} to the [...] "rediscovery" [...] of hunger in the mid-sixties had been extensive lobbying of politicians to improve welfare. Until the 1980s, this approach had greater impact. In the 1970s, U.S. federal expenditure on hunger relief grew by about 500%, with food stamps distributed free of charge to those in greatest need. According to Poppendieck, welfare was widely considered preferable to grass roots efforts, as the latter could be unreliable, did not give recipients consumer-style choice {{in the same way}} as did food stamps, and risked recipients feeling humiliated by having to turn to charity.

According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks were established in the US after 1981. Poppendieck says that for the first few years after the change, there was vigorous opposition from left, who argued that state welfare was much more suitable for meeting recipients needs. But in the decades that followed, food banks have become an accepted part of America's response to hunger. Demand for the services of US food bank increased further in the late 1990s, after the [...] "end of welfare as we know it" [...] with President Clinton's Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. In Canada, foodbanks underwent a period of rapid growth after the cutbacks in welfare that took place in the mid-1990s. As early as the 1980s, food banks had also begun to spread from the United States to the rest of the world. The first European food bank was founded in France during 1984. In the 1990s and early 2000s, food banks were established in South America, Africa and Asia, in several cases with van Hengel acting as a consultant. In 2007, The Global FoodBanking Network was formed.|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} the problem {{addressed}} is the lack of a thorough discussion of the relationship of the exaltation of Christ in Hebrews to the assortment of ideas and images present in Jewish apocalyptic literature which the epistle seems to echo. This study begins with a historical survey {{of the way in which}} the epistle was interpreted and used from the patristic period through to the Renaissance and Reformation. The purpose of this chapter is to set the question of Hebrews 2 ̆ 7 apocalyptic <b>roots</b> in <b>relief</b> from the kinds of questions historically asked of the epistle. Historically the epistle has been interpreted in a manner less interested in its contextual meaning and more interested in its usefulness in supporting an assortment of theological and ecclesiastical propositions throughout various periods. The second chapter outlines some of the most pertinent scholarship of the nineteenth century on the apocalyptic background of Hebrews. A number of nineteenth-century commentaries on Hebrews will be examined with special attention to those passages which most clearly reflect the influence of apocalyptic images and concepts. In their lack of attention to the relationship between Hebrews and other apocalyptic accounts of heavenly ascent, the observers of Hebrews from this period also show the unique {{nature of the}} question posed by this study. The third chapter examines the connections made by twentieth-century observers between Jewish apocalyptic writings, Qumran documents and Hebrews as those connections involve heavenly ascent, heavenly priesthood and the concept of a heavenly temple. This chapter will identify issues which are lacking treatment or insufficiently treated in current scholarship. Chapter four explores Jewish literature, both canonical and non-canonical, which describes heavenly visions or ascent by a Jewish figure in order to make connections to the heavenly ascent of Christ in Hebrews. Based on the examination of roots and the connections that will be drawn, this study will demonstrate three stages of development in the literature describing heavenly visions or heavenly ascent. This study will show the way in which Hebrews reflects the unique traits of each stage in its portrayal of the exaltation of Christ. The conclusion of this dissertation raises three passages from Hebrews which merit re-examination through the framework of heavenly ascent as described in the previous two chapters. I present avenues of further study which come to light when the epistle is viewed through this framework...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{magnitude of}} adjustment in osmotic potential (ψs) of water-stressed cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) leaves and roots was studied using plants raised in pots {{of sand and}} grown in a growth chamber. One and three water-stress preconditioning cycles were imposed by withholding water, and the subsequent adjustment in solute potential upon relief of the stress and complete rehydration was monitored with thermocouple psychrometers. Both leaves and roots exhibited a substantial adjustment in ψs in response to water stress with the former exhibiting the larger absolute adjustment. The osmotic adjustment of leaves was 0. 41 megapascal compared to 0. 19 megapascal in the roots. The roots, however, exhibited much larger percentage osmotic adjustments of 46 and 63 % in the one and three stress cycles, respectively, compared to 22 and 40 % in the leaves in similar stress cycles. The osmotically adjusted condition of leaves and <b>roots</b> decreased after <b>relief</b> of the single cycle stress to about half the initial value within 3 days, and to the well-watered control level within 6 days. In contrast, {{increasing the number of}} water-stress preconditioning cycles resulted in significant percentage osmotic adjustment still being present after 6 days in roots but not in the leaves. The decrease in ψs of leaves persisted longer in field-grown cotton plants compared to plants of the same age grown in the growth chamber. The advantage of decreased ψs in leaves and roots of water-stressed cotton plants was associated with the maintenance of turgor during periods of decreasing water potentials...|$|R
50|$|At the July 12, 2010, tapings of Xplosion, Young {{made his}} return to singles competition, losing to Suicide.

Young kept teaming with Jordan the following months, appearing exclusively on Xplosion, before returning to Impact! on the October 7 live edition, where they defeated Ink Inc., after a low blow by Jordan. However, after the match Young announced that they were forfeiting the match due to the finish and suggested they set up a rematch at Bound for Glory. In storyline, Young's mental issues made him completely unaware of Jordan's bisexual orientation and interest in him. At the pay-per-view Young's antics cost him and Jordan the match against Ink Inc. On the November 4 edition of Impact! Young and Jordan were featured in a segment, where they tried to get help from a specialist to improve their relationship with one another. This ended up being Fritz's final appearance for the company on his old contract, which expired shortly thereafter. On November 12 it was reported that Fritz had re-signed with the promotion. Young and Jordan returned to Impact! on December 16, defeating Generation Me (Jeremy and Max Buck) in a tag team match. Prior to the match Young appeared with the old TNA World Heavyweight Championship belt, which had been thrown away by Immortal, when they introduced the newly designed version of the belt.

40|$|I {{assert that}} in the months and years {{following}} the January 2010 earthquake, the humanitarian ecology in Port-au-Prince was neither a singular apparatus, as it is often called, nor a scattered and uncontained chaos of uncoordinated NGOs (James 2010). I argue that instead of these two extremes, the humanitarian actors collected into groups distinctive in characteristics such as size, funding mechanisms, and interactions with the attempted humanitarian oversight structure. These factions, internal to the aid apparatus, at once shaped aid workers’ perceptions of urgency and their subsequent views {{on the needs of}} the urban Haitian population at a given time while they were shaped, themselves, by the internal logics of competition underlying the inflated population of aid agencies and organizations. In the protracted setting of emergency and crisis in Port-au-Prince, need was based on often opposing analyses of in what particular stage of need lay the imagined state of emergency. These temporal analyses defined the form and function of aid offered to different communities, and the aid apparatus was rarely, if ever, in consensus about where on the continuum of need lay the residents of Port-au-Prince. Multiple contradictory analyses led to discordance within the overall aid effort: some were firmly <b>rooted</b> in the <b>relief</b> timeline typical of an immediate post-disaster temporality, while other took actions reflective of a longer-term development mindset. These contradictory analyses were especially evident in medical settings, wherein the efforts that aid workers took in assisting individual patients often reflected their organizations’ overall attitude concerning the temporality of need of Port-au-Prince as a whole. While aid workers constructed their analyses in part through their daily routines, their interactions with and observations of the medical structure as it existed in the post-earthquake months, these attitudes were also fueled by a broader, underlying internal competition that played out in the hyper-saturated ecology of aid in Port-au-Prince. This dissertation is divided into five chapters. The first chapter lays out the background of each of the three major sets of humanitarian actors that will be the focus of this work: the UN and its military arm, MINUSTAH; Cuban medical aid and its relatively recent Venezuelan-Bolivarian influence; and what I call micro-NGOs, the small-scale organizations that did not fall under the radar or command of the UN humanitarian coordination agency, OCHA. Chapter two focuses on a singular geographic space, the Pétionville tent camp, where I conducted my first months of field research in 2010. By focusing on particular projects implemented within the camp by its managing NGO, I use this camp space to describe how NGOs dealt with the often hazy period of transition between emergency relief and development aid. Chapter three takes a step away from Port-au-Prince and back in time to look at the development of the relationships between Venezuela and Cuba, Cuba and Haiti, and Haiti and Venezuela. This chapter discusses the making of the “fragile state” in contemporary development policy research, and explains how the alliance between Cuba, Venezuela and Haiti marks a turning point in both Latin American regionalism and the oft-referenced “South-South aid” collaborations. The fourth chapter discusses two very disparate ways in which revolution and its identities and ideologies played out in the setting of post-earthquake Port-au-Prince. The first section looks at revolutionary ideology in Chávez’s political and economic campaign as it joins Cuba and Haiti into his Bolivarian movement, while the second section looks at the reasons for which MINUSTAH armed forced have failed to connect with the local populous and has, in fact, come to signify a newfound revolutionary enemy by certain political and geographical factions within Port-au-Prince. The fifth and final chapter looks more closely at the relationship between micro-NGOs and the UN oversight structure. Here, I finalize the argument that I began above wherein competition between the “uncoordinated” NGOs proved to {{be an integral part of}} the post-earthquake humanitarian structure, the many disparate pieces actually forming an ecology and an economy that supported the continued presence of all levels of foreign interventionist actors...|$|R
