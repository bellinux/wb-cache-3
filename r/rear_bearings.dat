40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{performance}} of modern high-bypass jet engines a promising approach is to replace the low pressure-vane row arranged downstream of a strutted intermediate turbine diffuser (mid turbine frame) by the application of turning struts and to integrate functionalities such as bearing supports, lubrication pipes, engine mounts and aggressive duct designs. Thus the weight may be reduced which results in a lower specific fuel consumption and reduced CO 2 -emissions. The additional functions of the mid turbine frame (MTF) structures lead to constraints like a minimum required strut thickness leading to a maximum possible number of struts. Therefore a highly three-dimensional design of the airfoils and the duct, respectively, is necessary to reduce strong secondary flow effects and further to provide suitable flow angle and Mach number for the following low pressure turbine (LPT). A future area of application for mid turbine frames with turning struts, so-called turning mid turbine frames (TMTF), may also be in direct-drive open-rotor engine architectures.

25|$|Gears {{inside a}} {{windmill}} convey {{power from the}} rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>bearing.</b> It has the brake around {{the outside of the}} rim and teeth {{in the side of the}} rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} sixteen pole {{electric motor}} designed by Captain Krebs to develop [...] at 200V and 200A was constructed at the Societe des Forges et Chantiers at Le Havre, was 1 metre {{in diameter and}} weighed 2 tonnes.

Once installed {{it was found that}} the <b>rear</b> <b>bearing</b> was inaccessible and could not be repaired with the motor installed. It was difficult to inspect the armature or repair damage to the insulation. The motor was not designed to come to an immediate halt when power was disconnected, but instead would freewheel to a halt relatively slowly. Reverse power could not be applied until it had stopped moving, so it was not possible to immediately reverse the propeller in case of emergency. The motor proved so problematic that it was replaced with a smaller but more powerful Sautter-Harlé motor.|$|R

40|$|Novel {{rotating}} machinery design concepts and architectures are being explored to reduce mass, energy consumption, manufacturing costs, and environmental impact while increasing performance. As component manufacturers supply parts to original equipment manufacturers, {{it is desirable}} to design the components using a systems approach {{so that they are}} optimized for system-level performance. To accomplish that, suppliers must be able to model and predict the behavior of the whole machinery. Traditional computer-aided design/computer-aided engineering master-modeling approaches enable manual changes to be propagated to linked models. Novel knowledge-based master-modeling approaches enable automated coordination of multidisciplinary analyses. In this article, we present a specific implementation of such a knowledge-based master-modeling approach that facilitates multidisciplinary design optimization of {{rotating machinery}}. The master-model (MM) approach promotes the existence of a single governing version of the product definition as well as operating scenarios. Rules, scripts, and macros link the MM to domain-specific models. A simple yet illustrative industry application is presented, where rotor-dynamics and displacement analyses are performed to evaluate relocation alternatives for the <b>rear</b> <b>bearing</b> position of a rotating machinery under a ‘fan-blade-off’ load case...|$|R
5000|$|C. variopedatus builds {{and lives}} {{permanently}} in a tough, flexible, papery U-shaped tube buried in soft substrate with both ends protruding like little chimneys.

The parapodia on segments 13, 14 and 15 are fused into three paddle-shaped, piston-like structures, the purpose {{of which is to}} pump water through the tube. The water is drawn in through the anterior end and expelled through the posterior end, passing through the fine mesh of the mucus bag where food particles get trapped.
