The abbey was a typically Cistercian plain building in early Gothic style. As the church of a mendicant order the abbey had no spire but a wooden <b>ridge</b> <b>turret.</b>|$|E

50|$|When {{the height}} of a roof turret exceeds its width it is usually called a tower or steeple in English {{architecture}}, and when {{the height of}} a <b>ridge</b> <b>turret's</b> roof exceeds its width, it is called a spire in English architecture or a Flèche in French architecture.|$|R

In 1706 and in 1712, some repair work repairs {{were made on}} the church. The altar-piece was carved by a local artist in 1780.

50|$|The west {{building}} is a well-preserved example of a large half-timbered structure divided between an east building from 1775 and a west building from 1755. The external walls are built of granite boulders and the low and wide barrel vault with groins over the windows are formed by large medieval bricks. Both buildings have wooden cornices, hip roofs, spires and <b>ridge</b> <b>turrets.</b> The east building has a front dormer over the main entrance which is decorated with an architrave. Steep steps lead to the entrance which has wooden pilasters.|$|R
50|$|The goods station's main {{building}} was designed in a Neo-Baroque style by architect Heinrich Wenck and built in 1920-22 after a design phase {{that had begun}} in 1918. It was one of Wenck's last works as DSB's chief architect. The two-storey building is 15 bays long and is crowned by a hipped roof with a lantern and four <b>ridge</b> <b>turrets</b> together with a copper-clad spire topped by a Baroque onion dome. The facade is divided into lesenes. It is built of red brick and roofed with red tiles. The ventilation hoods and the flashing around the dormers are also in copper.|$|R

50|$|Like the Koninginnekerk in Rotterdam {{this church}} was built {{thanks to a}} gift from the sisters Van Dam. The inauguration {{followed}} on 27 November 1898. It was a strong centralizing church hall plan with a developed, closed three-sided apse and front tower, flanked by two lower stair towers. The apse was externally accentuated by a simple gable and <b>ridge</b> <b>turrets.</b> The interior was equipped with galleries and was dominated by a strong standing in the chancel choir. The building was an important example of stylistic innovation in the Protestant church building in 1900, resulting from the eclecticism, equally important work from the work of Hooykaas B. Jr.|$|R

You have then, observed, {{two great}} principles, {{as far as}} {{northern}} architecture is concerned; first, that the pointed arch {{is to be the}} means by which the weight of the wall or roof is to be sustained; secondly, that the steep gable is the form most proper for the roof itself. And now observe this most interesting fact, that all the loveliest Gothic architecture in the world is based on the group of lines composed of the pointed arch and the gable. If you look at the beautiful apse of Amiens Cathedral--a work justly celebrated over all Europe--you will find it formed merely of a series of windows surmounted by pure gables of open work. If you look at the transept porches of Rouen, or at the great and celebrated porch of the Cathedral of Rheims, or that of Strasbourg, Bayeux, Amiens, or Peterborough, still you will see that these lovely compositions are nothing more than richly decorated forms of gable over pointed arch. But more than this, you must be all well aware how fond our best architectural artists are of the street effects of foreign cities; and even those now present who have not personally visited any of the continental towns must remember, I should think, some of the many interesting drawings by Mr. Prout, Mr. Nash, and other excellent draughtsmen, which have for many years adorned our exhibitions. Now, the principal charm of all those continental street effects is dependent on the houses having high-pitched gable roofs. In the Netherlands, and Northern France, where the material for building is brick or stone, the fronts of the stone gables are raised above the roofs, and you have magnificent and grotesque ranges of steps or curves decorated with various ornaments, succeeding one another in endless perspective along the streets of Antwerp, Ghent, or Brussels. In Picardy and Normandy, again, and many towns of Germany, where the material for building is principally wood, the roof is made to project over the gables, fringed with a beautifully carved cornice, and casting a broad shadow down the house front. This is principally seen at Abbeville, Rouen, Lisieux, and others of the older towns of France. But, in all cases, the effect of the whole street depends on the prominence of the gables; not only of the fronts towards the streets, but of the sides also, set with small garret or dormer windows, each of the most fantastic and beautiful form, and crowned with a little spire or pinnacle. Wherever there is a little winding stair, or projecting bow window, or any other irregularity of form, the steep <b>ridges</b> shoot into <b>turrets</b> and small spires, as in fig. 8,[6] each in its turn crowned by a fantastic ornament, covered with curiously shaped slates or shingles, or crested with long fringes of rich ironwork, so that, seen from above and from a distance, the intricate grouping of the roofs of a French city is no less interesting than its actual streets; and in the streets themselves, the masses of broad shadow which the roofs form against the sky, are a most important background to the bright and sculptured surfaces of the walls.|$|R
