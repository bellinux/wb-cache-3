Generally speaking, prosecutions should be initiated only where alternate methods to enforce compliance have been tried and have failed, where the offender has demonstrated a wilful or <b>repeated</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with the social regulatory statute or where the public interest otherwise requires prosecution {{in order to protect}} the integrity of the regulatory scheme. Examples of social regulatory statutes which would be subject to this policy are: th...|$|E
40|$|Government {{non-compliance}} with {{court orders}} is an endemic problem in South Africa {{to such an}} extent that lawyers seeking to vindicate the constitutional right to education must prepare for this in designing their litigation strategies. This note describes the experience of the Legal Resources Centre in dealing with <b>repeated</b> government <b>non-compliance</b> during the course of recent litigation that sought to ensure the provisioning of educator and non-educator posts in the Eastern Cape between 2012 and 2013. More broadly, however, it explores the two main tools at the disposal of litigants in such instances - the law of contempt, and execution pursuant to the State Liability Act 20 of 1957. The note concludes that contempt remedies are of limited use and instead, that execution against government property is much more likely both to provide the claimant with a meaningful remedy and to bestir dilatory officials into action...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2010, after <b>repeated</b> {{complaints}} of <b>non-compliance</b> by the National Congress Party {{with the peace}} accords, the Sudan Liberation Movement withdrew from the Darfur Peace Agreement. Minnawi resigned as Senior Assistant to the President of Sudan and as Chairperson of the Transitional Darfur Regional Authority, to merge his faction, SLM/MM, with the other resistance defense forces in Darfur, including SLM/AW, Abdul Wahid, in resisting attacks by the Sudanese Armed Forces, and its militia, on citizens in rebel-held areas. In 2011, SLM/MM joined the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) opposed to the Khartoum Government.|$|R

Factors {{to be considered in}} deciding whether a prosecution for nudity is in the public interest include: • whether there was an element of aggressive exhibitionism in the act of nudity • whether the act of nudity significantly disturbed adjacent residents or members of the public • whether there was blatant, <b>repeated</b> or wilful <b>non-compliance</b> with, or disobedience of, the law, despite warnings by the police • whether the act of nudity occurred in an isolated or secluded location or in an area commonly known to be frequented by nude sunbather...|$|R
30|$|The {{caseworker}} counsels and {{advises the}} UBII recipient and decides about placement in active labor market programs. If the caseworker detects non-compliance of the UBII recipient, the welfare agency is legally required {{to impose a}} sanction by benefit revocation (Chapters 31, 31 a, 31 b and 32 of Book II of the German Social Code). However, there is discretion at the agency level whether a sanction is actually imposed or not. All UBII recipients are informed {{about the possibility of}} sanctions in the integration contract and each time they are assigned to a program. Yet, there is no formal warning process when a non-compliance is detected. Although a hearing of the benefit recipient is formally required before the imposition of a sanction, there is evidence that this requirement is not implemented in practice as reported by Baethge-Kinsky et al. (2007). Hence, the welfare agency may immediately impose a sanction. Sanctions have a duration of three months and can be imposed for various reasons. For minor non-compliances, such as the failure to properly report on job search activities to the welfare agency or not showing up for an appointment with the caseworker, benefits are cut by 10 %. More severe infringements (lack of job search effort, refusal to accept a suitable job offer, refusal to participate in a program) lead to a benefit reduction of 30 %. In case of repeated incidents of severe infringements within one year, a second (60 % cut) or a third sanction (100 % cut) can be imposed. A similar possibility exists in the case of <b>repeated</b> minor <b>non-compliances,</b> where sanctions can be increased gradually by 10 % up to a cut of 100 %. For UBII recipients below 25 years of age, benefits can be reduced by 100 % even for the first incident of non-compliance.|$|R
40|$|In this PhD thesis, {{we study}} the {{enforcement}} of environmental law using an economic perspective. Environmental law enforcement is an important topic for two reasons. Firstly, regulatory initiatives are important drivers for demand for environmental goods and services, for producing in a more environmentally-friendly way and for internalizing possible external costsof economic activities. Thus, enforcement of environmental regulation is a tool for going to a more sustainable economy. Secondly, setting up a regulatory framework without taking sufficient enforcement measures gives non-compliant firms a competitive edge over firms that do invest in regulatory compliance. In a competitive environment, {{this can lead to}} complying firms going out of business or, alternatively, reducing their compliance efforts. Thus, it is clear that regulation without enforcement leads to undesirable outcomes. The enforcement process consists of an interaction between firms and regulatory enforcement authorities. In our case, these are environmental enforcement administrations and/or judges in court. The use of an economic perspective consists in the way that we analyze the interests of different parties and their interactions. We make use of micro-economic modeling and econometric methods, such as discrete choice theory and matching methods, to analyze how decision-making occurs in theory and in practice. Some of the results that we obtain are the following. Firstly, we find that judges take the economic costs of penalties (=possible loss in employment) into account when they take environmental enforcement decisions. This is the economic equivalent of the application of the proportionality principle. However, we do find that different judges in Belgium make differentdecisions in the trade-off between compliance promotion and proportionality. Secondly, we find that penalties for environmental law non-compliance (imposed by judges or administrative enforcement officials) do not increase explicitly with intentionality, but that they do increase with repeat offenses. This is equivalent to a decision process in which judges/enforcement officials learn about intent through <b>repeated</b> observations of <b>non-compliance.</b> Thirdly, we find that judges in court impose higher penalties for similar decisions compared to administrative enforcement. We develop a methodology for statistically analyzing enforcement treatment differences which could be applied in a variety of empirical legal settings or in the area of law & economics. Finally, we develop a model to understand why settlement proposals are often very low forenvironmental cases. We also explain why the institution of legal boundaries on allowable settlement proposals would only have superficial effects. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false" <w:lsdexception=""  Acknowledgements	I Table of Contents	III List of figures	VII List of tables	VIII Propositions	XI Chapter 1 : Introduction 1.
