40|$|In marine environment, the {{physical}} and mechanical performances of reinforced concrete members will vary distinctly with time, which reduces {{the safety of the}} structures. The main factors influencing the durability of reinforced concrete members include the deterioration of concrete, the reduction of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> strength, the decrease of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> area, the weakening of the bond strength between <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> and concrete, as well as the concrete material performance, the ratio of water to cement, the thickness of concrete cover and the chloride concentration, etc. The <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion model is the key problem in the durability calculation of reinforced concrete structures. Various <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion models are presented for the durability calculation of reinforced concrete structures and the values of the parameters in the models determined by different literatures are quite scattered. The calculating results from different models are evidently discrepant. In this paper, the various models for calculating the durability of reinforced concrete structures are compared and the effects of the model parameters on calculating results are investigated through an example. Some conclusions are remarked. It is useful for the further development of durability design theory and durability calculation method of reinforced concrete structures in marine environment. ...|$|R

25|$|In wet {{and cold}} climates, {{reinforced}} concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures {{that may be}} exposed to deicing salt may benefit from use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, hot dip galvanised or stainless steel rebar. Good design and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon steel rebar due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green colour of its epoxy coating. Hot dip galvanized rebar may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar.

25|$|The use of {{de-icing}} salts on roadways, used {{to lower the}} freezing point of water, {{is probably one of}} the primary causes of premature failure of reinforced or prestressed concrete bridge decks, roadways, and parking garages. The use of epoxy-coated <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> and the application of cathodic protection has mitigated this problem to some extent. Also FRP (fiber-reinforced polymer) rebars are known to be less susceptible to chlorides. Properly designed concrete mixtures that have been allowed to cure properly are effectively impervious to the effects of de-icers.|$|E
25|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} columns typically contain large diameter vertical rebar (<b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars)</b> {{arranged in}} a ring, surrounded by lighter-gauge hoops of rebar. Upon analysis of failures due to earthquakes, it has been realized that the weakness {{was not in the}} vertical bars, but rather in inadequate strength and quantity of hoops. Once the integrity of the hoops is breached, the vertical rebar can flex outward, stressing the central column of concrete. The concrete then simply crumbles into small pieces, now unconstrained by the surrounding rebar. In new construction a greater amount of hoop-like structures are used.|$|E

Researches of corrosion were basically done in steel bars without stress by domestic and foreign scholars. Therefore, it is significant to study the relationship between rebar strain and corrosion rate by testing. In the test, <b>reinforced</b> <b>bar</b> groups were imposed with different levels of strain and the strains were kept by reaction frame. Then, these groups were put into the salt spray device for accelerated corrosion in four time periods. Finally, mass loss rates of these <b>reinforced</b> <b>bars</b> were measured and calculated.

25|$|Hydro{{demolition}} is {{not used}} as much for demolition {{as it is for}} surface restoration and protection projects. When concrete has deteriorated or the reinforcing steel has begun to corrode, it is necessary to remove any unsound concrete and <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> (rebar) in order to replace it with new concrete and maintain the integrity of the structure. This process has also been used to remove sound concrete that is not compromised in any way. This may be done to install a preventive cathodic protection system, or to remove concrete in structures in which vibration is a concern. Unlike jackhammers, hydrodemolition does not produce vibrations throughout a structure and therefore does not introduce micro fractures.|$|E

40|$|The initial {{meaning of}} brand {{is not only}} to label the {{products}} for manufacturers, but also allow consumers to distinguish the differences among all the manufactories and their products. The concepts of the business brand and product brand of <b>Reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> industry only are known for professional constructors and steel retailers within this industry. The channels of <b>Reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> marketing are complicated. It's difficult for consumers to learn any knowledge of the Re-bar brand from the appearance of the buildings. Even for those <b>Reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> Manufacturers who provide excellent product quality, the marketing information still can not be efficiently delivered to consumers. Manufactories often suffer serious competitions to each other. Based on this special industrial background and from the <b>Reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> industries point of view, this study motivates and discusses about how to create the ingredient branding, do brand alliances with construction industry, provide and deliver marketing information altogether to the final consumers and to change the <b>Reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> industry sales channel. This study aims {{to find out how to}} proceed the ingredient branding and brand alliance for <b>Reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> and construction industry to have the end-users know their business brand equity. The research consists of two phase based upon the grounded throry and the qualitative research. Each phase includes the processes of data collecting and data analysis. The data was collected by depth interview with the owner of the constructions and professional managers. The open coding and axial coding procedure of the grounded theory were used to generate the categories and the axial of the research, and then to analyze these data to have theoretical saturation to proceed select coding. And use it to draw four common core categories for the brand alliance between Re-bar and construction industries: Brand Alliance Partner Selection Stage, Brand Alliance Partner Communication Stage, Brand Alliance Partner In-practice Stage and Brand Alliance Partner Effects Assessment. For the business brand alliance, product brand alliance, product ingredient branding and product co-branding all have the above mentioned four stages. It recommends <b>Reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> manufacturers to redefine the customers, not just for the retailers or constructions but extend to the end-users of building, to select constructors having consistent brand element and common business concept in the brand alliance partner selection stage; unite the constructors as marketing strategic for brand alliance partner communication stage; proceed integrated marketing strategic for in-practice stage. The final stage is to access does consumers perceive the differences towards the brand alliance of <b>Reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> and construction industry and their behavior towards this. The sufficient reason for branding alliance between <b>Reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> and construction industry is based on consumers perceived and help them to perceive the unseen <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> steel quality inside the buildings. Therefore, it not only adds values to buildings but also helps the constructions and <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> industries gaining competitiveness through brand alliance. 品牌最初的意義不僅讓生產者標記所生產的商品，也讓最終消費者能區別不同的生產者及其商品，但國內建築條鋼產業之企業品牌及產品品牌的概念只存在於中間商、營建商及工程領域內之專業人士，且產業實務上鋼筋產品之流通體系複雜，最終購屋者更難以知悉建築物內之鋼筋品牌知識；條鋼業者再努力生產出好的產品，行銷訊息無法傳達至最終購屋者，使條鋼業者長期陷於同業間之價格競爭；基於此產業之特殊背景，本研究動機以條鋼業立場探討條鋼業與營建業進行品牌聯盟，共同傳達行銷訊息至最終購屋者並改變現有條鋼廠之銷售通路；研究目的在於尋求條鋼業與營建商進行品牌聯盟及產品要素品牌打造之實務運行方式，並建立起以最終購屋者為基礎之條鋼業企業品牌權益。 本研究依紮根理論質化研究方法設計二階段研究，每階段各包含資料蒐集及資料分析程序，並秉持紮根理論之程序以資料蒐集與資料分析的方式並行；資料 蒐集方式以深入訪談營建商之企業主及專業經理人並取得研究資料；資料分析方式以紮根理論研究法之開放性編碼、主軸編碼程序，於二階段研究中使資料達理論飽和後進行選擇性編碼程序。二階段研究之開放性編碼及主軸編碼程序總結發展出關鍵的主類別及主軸，並以選擇性編碼程序發展出條鋼業與營建業進行企業層級之企業品牌聯盟，與產品層級之產品品牌聯盟、產品要素品牌打造、產品聯合品牌行銷，共同的四組核心類別分別為品牌聯盟夥伴評選階段、品牌聯盟夥伴溝通階段、品牌聯盟實行階段及品牌聯盟成效評估階段。夥伴評選階段建議條鋼業者重新定義顧客的範圍並擴大至潛在購屋者，評選有一致性品牌元素且共同經營理念的營建商，夥伴溝通階段結合營建商的行銷策略，實行階段為共同進行整合行銷溝通，評估成效階段為實證探討購屋者對條鋼業之企業品牌或產品品牌、營建業之企業品牌或產品品牌雙方品牌聯盟前後，消費者行為的變化及潛在購屋者對聯盟前後之產品知覺及購買意願提升的程度。條鋼業與營建業進行品牌聯盟並以最終購屋者知覺價值為依歸，使其知覺建築物內部看不見的鋼鐵品質進而提升營建商之主建築物產品價值，以達成品牌聯盟之功效並提升雙方之競爭力。目	錄 第一章 緒論 01 第一節 研究背景與動機 01 第二節 研究目的 03 第三節 研究主題及範圍 04 第四節 研究流程 06 第二章 文獻探討 07 第一節 品牌聯盟 07 第二節 聯合品牌行銷與產品要素品牌打造 11 第三節 質化研究 12 第四節 紮根理論 14 第三章 條鋼業及營建業之產業概況 21 第一節 條鋼業之概況 21 第二節 營建業之概況 26 第四章 二階段研究 31 第一節 第一階段研究 33 第二節 第二階段研究 79 第三節 選擇性編碼 135 第五章 結論與建議 146 第一節 研究結論 146 第二節 研究建議 149 參考文獻 151 中文文獻 151 英文文獻 152 附錄 154 一. 共同研究邀請函 154 二. 第一階段訪談題綱 155 三. 第二階段訪談題綱 156 四. 本研究開放性編碼原則 15...|$|R

2500|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) is {{a composite}} material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility. The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. [...] Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (in tension), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning.|$|E

2500|$|Ideally, the {{underground}} {{part of the}} assembly should reside {{in an area of}} high ground conductivity. If {{the underground}} cable is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another conductive path, such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (ground ring) conductor, cable radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> can be used for a ground conductor (Ufer ground).
