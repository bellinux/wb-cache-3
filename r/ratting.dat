5|$|The {{earliest}} records surrounding {{development of}} the Standard Schnauzer in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to <b>ratting,</b> herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more compact size for <b>ratting</b> by combining it with the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer appeared in 1888, and the first exhibition was held in 1899.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{tail docking}} {{was thought to}} prevent rabies, {{strengthen}} the back, increase the animal's speed, and prevent injuries when <b>ratting,</b> fighting, and baiting. In early Georgian times in the United Kingdom a tax was levied upon working dogs with tails, so many types of dog were docked to avoid this tax.

25|$|Bummer was a {{black-and-white}} Newfoundland or Newfoundland cross who established himself outside the saloon of Frederick Martin in 1860 and quickly {{proved to be}} an exceptional rat-killer. His <b>ratting</b> talent spared him the fate of the former owner of the territory, Bruno, who had been poisoned with strychnine shortly before Bummer's arrival. He scraped a living begging scraps from passers-by and the patrons of the saloon and other establishments along Montgomery Street.|$|E
25|$|Their <b>ratting</b> {{talent and}} unique bond was seized {{upon by the}} city's press. Martin's saloon was a {{favorite}} haunt of newspapermen and journalists, so, with the dogs a fixture outside the bar, they never had to travel far for a story. The exploits of the dogs were recorded in detail in the Californian, Daily Alta California, Daily Morning Call, and Daily Evening Bulletin, the editors vying {{with each other in}} their attempts to endow the pair's adventures with thrills and parallels to the human condition. Bummer was portrayed as the gentleman down on his luck, yet still faithful and conscientious, while Lazarus, the mongrel, was cast {{in the role of the}} sly and self-serving fair-weather friend. When Bummer was shot in the leg after only a couple of months, and Lazarus left him to run with another dog, it suited the press no end: Bummer was said to be feeling the sting of ingratitude at the desertion of the cur he had saved from death. Lazarus' return when Bummer recovered only added to the excitement.|$|E

40|$|A {{strategy}} for in vitro propagation of <b>rat</b> nephrons. BackgroundRecent {{advances in the}} understanding of the molecular biology of rodent renal development have lead to the ability to culture the components of the developing <b>rat</b> kidney—the ureteric bud (UB) and the metanephric mesenchyme (MM) —in isolation from one another. Here we here describe a method for subculturing and propagating either whole <b>rat</b> metanephric rudiments or isolated <b>rat</b> UBs. Exploiting the branching program intrinsic to the UB, propagated <b>rat</b> UBs can be recombined with fresh <b>rat</b> mesenchyme to form a large number of <b>rat</b> “neokidneys” derived from a single progenitor that may be amenable to site-specific modulation of function. MethodsWhole <b>rat</b> metanephric rudiments or isolated <b>rat</b> UBs were cultured and subdivided through several generations. Both cultured progenitor and subsequent generations of isolated <b>rat</b> UBs were recombined with freshly isolated <b>rat</b> metanephric mesenchyme. The tubules of these <b>rat</b> neokidneys were examined for expression of epithelial markers. ResultsIsolated <b>rat</b> UBs and whole <b>rat</b> metanephric rudiments could be propagated through several generations and appeared morphologically identical to their progenitors. Generations of isolated <b>rat</b> UB could be recombined with fresh <b>rat</b> mesenchyme and the resultant neokidney displayed the same morphologic appearance as the whole <b>rat</b> kidney rudiment. The UB-derived and MM-derived portions of the tubules of these <b>rat</b> neokidneys appear contiguous. ConclusionsThe recombination of cultured and propagated <b>rat</b> UB with <b>rat</b> mesenchyme yielded <b>rat</b> neokidneys with tubular structures that appeared morphologically identical to whole <b>rat</b> kidney. In vitro propagation of <b>rat</b> metanephric rudiments and recombination of <b>rat</b> UB and MM suggest the possibility of designing nephrons that possess specific desirable functions that can be propagated in vitro...|$|R

500|$|The Miniature Schnauzer is a {{breed of}} small dog of the Schnauzer type that {{originated}} in Germany in the mid-to-late 19th century.

They are described as [...] "spunky" [...] but aloof dogs, with good guarding tendencies without some guard dogs' predisposition to bite. Miniature Schnauzers are recognized in three colors internationally: solid black, black and silver, and a color known as 'salt and pepper'. There is a controversial fourth color variant in Miniature Schnauzers, pure white, which is not recognized universally.|$|E

FECa was decreased in hyperthyroid (Hyper-T) <b>rats</b> and increased in hypothyroid (Hypo-T) <b>rats</b> as compared to euthyroid (Eu-T) <b>rats.</b> Ca 2 + uptake into renal brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) was increased in Hyper-T <b>rats</b> and decreased in Hypo-T <b>rats</b> as compared to Eu-T <b>rats.</b> Km was lower in Hyper-T <b>rats</b> and higher in Hypo-T <b>rats</b> as compared to Eu-T <b>rats</b> whereas, Vmax remained unaltered. The transition temperature for calcium uptake varied inversely with the thyroid hormone status. Renal BBM of Hyper-T <b>rats</b> showed decreased anisotropy and polarisation of DPH as compared to EU-T <b>rats</b> whereas these values were increased in Hypo-T <b>rats.</b> Thus, the altered BBM fluidity appears to modulate Ca 2 + transport across BBM. Na+/Ca 2 + exchange activity of renal cells was increased in Hyper-T and decreased in Hypo-T <b>rats</b> as compared to Eu-T <b>rats.</b> Vmax for Na+/Ca 2 + exchange was increased in Hyper-T <b>rats</b> and deceased in Hypo-T <b>rats</b> as compared to Eu-T <b>rats,</b> whereas, [Na+] 0. 5 was similar in all three groups.
