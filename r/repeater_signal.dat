25|$|The fast lines {{north of}} Harrow and all lines north of Rickmansworth are signalled with LUL signalling, but using four-aspect Network Rail signal heads. The upper two lights are a two-aspect stop signal {{displaying}} either a green or red aspect, the lower two lights a <b>repeater</b> <b>signal</b> {{for the next}} stop signal ahead showing a green or yellow aspect, or no aspect when the stop signal shows a red aspect. Thus they are effectively four-light three-aspect signals with green/red/green/yellow lights from the top, danger being a single red light, caution the top green light over a yellow light, and clear two green lights.|$|E
25|$|This scheme, on {{the face}} of it, was a fairly {{standard}} colour light system, with each stop signal (which could show red or green) having an attendant <b>repeater</b> <b>signal</b> (showing red, yellow or green – the red used only for when the two stop signals on either side were also red). What made the scheme unusual was the provision of an automatic 'calling on' facility. The stop signals had an additional signal head ('marker light') that featured a red aspect plus a miniature yellow aspect. This marker light was mounted part way up the post. On repeater signals, the marker light was offset to the left-hand side of the post to indicate that the 'stop and proceed' rule applied. Junction stop signals were provided with two main signal heads, one mounted higher than the other. Splitting distant signals had three main heads, the centre one mounted higher than the other two.|$|E

50|$|A major {{drawback}} to this architecture {{is the fact}} that a missed two-tone sequence {{at the beginning of a}} transmission, or a lost signal during a transmission, causes the rest of a transmission to be missed. If the mobile receiver gets interference or loses the <b>repeater</b> <b>signal</b> for the moment the second selective calling tone is sent, it remains muted, missing the entire conversation. The same is true if the <b>repeater</b> <b>signal</b> is lost at any time during a transmission. Only another two-tone sequence being sent will allow it to rejoin the conversation.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a signal}} aspect is not {{visible from the}} proper {{distance}} (because of track curves for instance), a <b>repeater</b> <b>signal</b> is installed to aid drivers.

Their posts are painted grey and equipped with plates with Roman numerals: III, II, I where the [...] "I" [...] stands closest to the main signal. Their colour language is identical to warning shields, except the fact they also have a continuously glowing white light, which informs {{that this is not a}} main signal but a repeater.|$|E

On September 23, 1987, this was replaced by new sign-on WFYF in Watertown. However, both stations were available in Massena and Malone for a short time. Eventually, WVNY added repeater station W60AF on channel 60 in Malone. A retransmission dispute forced Time Warner Cable systems to replace WVNY with future sister station WUTR from Utica, New York on December 16, 2010. At the same time, WFFF-TV was replaced by WNYF-CD from Watertown. Both stations returned to the lineup on January 8, 2011.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Data from {{mobile and}} {{stationary}} sensors 1, 2 will be vital in planetary surface exploration. The distribution and collection of sensor data in an ad-hoc wireless network presents unique challenges. Some {{of the conditions}} encountered in the field include: irregular terrain, mobile nodes, routing loops from clients associating with the wrong access point or repeater, network routing reconfigurations caused by moving <b>repeaters,</b> <b>signal</b> fade, and hardware failures. These conditions present the following problems: data errors, out of sequence packets, duplicate packets, and drop out periods (when the node is not connected). To mitigate {{the effects of these}} impairments, robust and reliable software architecture tolerant of communications outages must be implemented.

50|$|With traffic {{increasing}} to Cardiff International Airport, the Local Government transport consortium SWIFT {{also identified}} {{the potential for}} reopening the Vale of Glamorgan line. The scheme was promoted by the Vale of Glamorgan and Bridgend Borough Councils to the Welsh Assembly Government in August 1999. After agreeing funding, track upgrading and signalling works commenced in June 2004 with: 3.5 mi of new track laid; 6.5 mi of track upgraded; 15000 tonnes of ballast used; three new section signals (2 on the up and 1 on the down) were installed together with three distant signals and one <b>repeater</b> <b>signal</b> required by the curved approach to Llantwit Major Station. Final planning permission for the new stations and interchanges at Rhoose, Cardiff International Airport and Llantwit Major was granted in 2004 and from October 2004 the line was closed daily between Bridgend and Aberthaw or Barry for the station construction, with goods traffic passing at night. At Bridgend, the Barry bay was relaid and a new platform face built. Network Rail used three contractors: Mowlem for the permanent way; Carillion for signals and telephones; and Galliford Try for civil engineering, including the platforms. The Vale of Glamorgan Council {{was responsible for the}} construction of the interchanges at Rhoose, Cardiff International Airport and Llantwit Major. Network Rail spent £15m and the Vale of Glamorgan Council £2m making a grand total of £17m for the whole project. The daytime closures were shortened from April to enable crew training to commence.|$|E

In such cases repeater signals act as an interference to GNSS satellite signals and need to be mitigated.

In the analysis, we determine different threat regions based on satellite signal and <b>repeater</b> <b>signal</b> parameters. Secondly, it introduces a novel algorithm that performs simultaneous channel estimation and equalization for GNSS signals. The proposed algorithm proves to be resilient {{in the presence of}} GNSS repeater signals in comparison to regular DLL structures. Finally, based on the inherent channel estimation the algorithm provides, it is possible to characterize the parameters of GNSS repeaters...|$|E
