The inherent noise (that is, the error) in the channel poses the organism with a fundamental question: how can a genetic code be constructed to withstand noise while accurately and efficiently translating information? These [...] "rate-distortion" [...] models suggest that the genetic code originated {{as a result of}} the interplay of the three conflicting evolutionary forces: the needs for diverse amino acids, for error-tolerance and for minimal <b>resource</b> <b>cost.</b> The code emerges at a transition when the mapping of codons to amino acids becomes nonrandom. The code's emergence is governed by the topology defined by the probable errors and is related to the map coloring problem.|$|E
500|$|Whenever a card in play is {{activated}} or otherwise used, such as resources, it {{is referred to}} as [...] "" [...] and is generally unavailable for further use until the next turn. [...] Unlike Magic, however, characters can attack and defend in the same turn, unless they are [...] "stunned" [...] in combat. [...] Damage is calculated by adding the difference between an attacking character's attack and the defending character's defense, plus the <b>resource</b> <b>cost</b> of the card. [...] Any damage not absorbed by a defending character is applied to the player's life total. [...] The location of a card on the playing field can affect its statistics; in order to attack, characters further away from the opponent must possess a projectile weapon or the ability to fly, for instance. [...] Adjacent characters with a matching team affiliation within the Marvel universe can also reinforce one another's attack and defense, such as the Spider Friends and X-Men. [...] Cards activating an ability can be countered by the opponent, and these abilities and counters combine to form a [...] "chain" [...] that dictates the order in which their effects are applied.|$|E

40|$|In the {{implementation}} of the EC Water Framework Directive, the concept of environmental and <b>resource</b> <b>costs</b> applies above all to the cost recovery of water services. Article 9 of the Directive stipulates that „Member States shall take account of the principle of recovery of the costs of water services, including environmental and <b>resource</b> <b>costs.</b> “ However, environmental and <b>resource</b> <b>costs</b> were not sufficiently defined in the Directive. In order to further clarify the concept of environmental and <b>resource</b> <b>costs,</b> and in order to discuss their assessment in practice, a European working group (DG Eco 2) was set up in September 2003. The paper “Economic Valuation of Environmental and Resource Costs: The Case of Germany” first summarises some of some main results of the DG Eco 2 working group. It then moves on to describe how environmental and <b>resource</b> <b>costs</b> are currently dealt with in Germany, and examines how the results of the DG Eco 2 can be put to use in the German context. A further point is the link between the assessment of environmental and <b>resource</b> <b>costs</b> and the selection of cost-effective combinations of measures. Two options are discussed here: first, addressing the question whether and how information obtained through the selection of measures can be used to assess environmental and resources costs; and secondly, discussing how the selected measures themselves can help to achieve cost recovery for environmental and <b>resource</b> <b>costs.</b> In this way, the results of the DG Eco 2 are linked to a previous research project, in which Ecologic developed a handbook for the cost-effective selection of measures under the WFD. ...|$|R
