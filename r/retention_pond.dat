5|$|In Clear Lake City, heavy {{rainfall}} collapsed {{a portion of}} a grocery store roof, killing two workers. The precipitation caused moderate flooding across eastern portions of Harris County; over 400homes and 40businesses were flooded. Flooding across the Greater Houston area briefly halted the METRORail and closed several state roads. One person drowned after driving into a <b>retention</b> <b>pond.</b> Several people required rescue assistance, and in Comal County a car accident caused three fatalities. The passage of the storm temporarily left about 20,000electrical customers without power, though most outages were quickly restored. In San Antonio, one body was recovered from a creek and another died after driving into a flooded road and was swept into a drainage ditch in which four others survived. In Sisterdale, two people were killed when they were swept away stalled over Sister Creek. In Taylor County, near Abilene, flooding killed one person and forced the evacuation of about 2,000people. Damage in Texas totaled over $45million (2007USD).|$|E
500|$|Patrick Henry College {{is located}} in the town of Purcellville in rural {{northern}} Virginia, approximately [...] northwest of Washington D.C. The campus currently consists of seven buildings arranged around a <b>retention</b> <b>pond</b> popularly called [...] "Lake Bob", as well as several athletic fields. The oldest structure, Founders Hall, opened in 2000 and contains three classrooms, the college library, and various administrative and faculty offices. It is also home to the offices of the Home School Legal Defense Association. Hanna Rosin, author of God's Harvard, described the campus as [...] "tiny, less like an Ivy League college than like a Hollywood set of an old Ivy League school." [...] The buildings are of Colonial Revival architecture. The artwork in Founders Hall consists of copies of portraits of the Founding Fathers placed along a staircase, leading to a picture of Patrick Henry at the second Virginia convention which features a light from heaven guiding Henry's speech. The artwork is designed to, in the words of Hanna Rosin, [...] "remind the students that America was founded as a Christian nation." ...|$|E

State Road 51 in Lafayette County flooded, caused by the Steinhatchee River exceeding its banks. In Dixie County, several roads north of Cross City experienced flooding, while water entered at least 40homes along the Steinhatchee River.

Water entered several homes near the coast and surrounded outbuildings by up to [...] In Columbia County, preliminary losses were placed in excess of $20million as of July3 and did not take into account hundreds of homes that remained flooded at the time. Several bridges were washed out due to the heavy rain; both U.S. Route 319 and U.S. Route 98 were closed due to flooding. In Suwannee County, the Suwannee River at Live Oak reached its highest crest since Hurricane Dora in 1964. Gainesville received its second-highest daily rain total of [...] on June24. In Marion County, up to [...] of rain was reported near Fellowship. As a result, State Road 40 was closed due to high water. Additionally, as many as 52sinkholes were reported to have formed along roadways in the county. Flooding also occurred in Duval County. The public reported that water entered a home on Rose Street in Jacksonville. Streets were flooded in Orange Park, and water approached the doors of houses, forcing some residents to evacuate. The St. Marys River reached historic heights and flooded a lot homes in Baker and Nassau Counties.|$|E
