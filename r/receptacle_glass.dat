Transport of the system will typically be north of the Wye Barricade between WRAP and the 222 -S Laboratory. The samples are intended to conform to the US Department of Transportation (DOT) regulation 49 CFR 1 73. 4, ``Exceptions for small quantities. `` The regulations require prototype testing of the package to demonstrate the effectiveness of the packaging system. The test procedure consisted of one 24 -hour compression test and five drop tests of various orientations onto an unyielding drop pad. The testing of the Sample Transfer Canister System was performed between February 16, 1998 and February 25, 1998. The results of the testing concluded that the Sample Transfer Canister System successfully met the testing requirements with certain modifications to the original system. The modifications included replacing the original eight flange screws which were cold rolled 316 stainless steel with greater strength grade 8 high carbon-carbon steel screws, replacing the initial two <b>glass</b> <b>receptacles</b> with a better performing single <b>glass</b> <b>receptacle</b> which proved not to leak during testing, and adding more bubble wrap as extra padding...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{verify the}} {{cleaning}} of the apical foramen and apical extrusion of dentin chips in single-rooted teeth instrumented with two techniques, {{one of which}} including the apical patency procedure. Method: Thirty teeth were internally stained with Indian ink, divided in two groups, of which only group I was subjected to apical patency. The dentin chips extruded through the apical foramen were collected in a <b>glass</b> <b>receptacle</b> and quantified. The apical foramen region was divided in quadrants and analyzed with a stereomicroscope to verify {{the action of the}} instrument on the cemental canal walls. The teeth were scored 0 4 according to the number of clean walls (without Indian ink), 0 corresponding to no clean wall. Results: In group I, there was no dentin plug, but only 1 tooth was scored 4. In group II, 10 teeth presented dentin plug and all of them were scored 0. There was no statistically significant difference between groups I and II regarding the extruded dentin mass (Scheffé test; p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The use of the apical patency procedure in single-rooted teeth does not modify the amount of dentin chips extruded through the apical foramen, does not produce an adequate cleaning of the cemental canal walls, but remove the plug of dentin chips from the cemental canal...|$|R

Razina životne i duhovne stvarnosti ovisila je o gospodarskoj i socijalnoj razini naručitelja kao i o njegovom ukusu i obrazovanju, ali i o sposobnosti kreatora i izvođača djela. U Istri, kao području života članova carskih i senatorskih obitelji, te hijerarhijski brojnih službenika, svećenika i vojnika, naručivala su se i kupovala kvalitetno izrađena umjetnička djela kao i uporabni predmeti svakodnevnog života. Keramički proizvodi s minucioznim detaljima, srebrni i zlatni nakit, posebno geme, gravirane narukvice, izrađevine su serijskog obrta u kojima se ogleda i umjetnička crta. Značajni su mozaički podni i zidni detalji od kojih se svakako izdvaja tegula vermicula s likom Dioniza iz rimske vile u Verigama na Brijunima i kompozicija “Kažnjavanje Dirke” iz urbane vile u Puli kao i fresko dekoracije rimskih prostora. Kamene skulpture Antonije Minor i Agripine Minor iz Pule visoke su umjetničke i spomeničke vrijednosti. Sve ove grupe uporabnih predmeta i rimskih spomenika većim su dijelom otkrivene u nekropolama (Pula, Medulin, Nezakcij, Savudrija, Sv. Ivan Kornetski i dr.), a pojedinačni nalazi kamene i mozaičke antičke baštine potjeću iz Poreča, Pule, Nezakcija i Plomina. craft is a skill {{involving}} {{a number of}} activities of artists and craftsmen, executors of artistic ideas and creators of templates that shape, as well as spiritually enrich, the everyday life of individuals or a community. The level of material and spiritual reality in antique Istria depended {{not only on the}} economic and social level of the client and on his taste and education, but also on the ability of the creator and executor of the work. In Istria, where members of imperial and senatorial families as well as numerous officials, priests, and soldiers lived, high-quality works of art, as well as practical everyday artefacts, were commissioned and bought. Ceramic artefacts like cups of the Sarius-Surus type, terra nigra and terra sigillata with minute details, decorations and forms, even though mass produced in moulds by craftsmen, can be considered to be more sophisticated products than large quantities of mass-produced amphorae or similar <b>receptacles.</b> <b>Glass</b> bottles, cups and plates imported from the West and East were also mass produced, but given the thickness of the glass, transparency, colour, form, and decoration, they are more sophisticated than numerous lacrimarii and other practical everyday vessels. This is why multicoloured pyxides and “millefiori” type bowls capture our attention with their unique execution and beauty. Jewellery, particularly gemstones, although made using a matrix for mass production in the workshops of Aquileia, are certainly works of art given that they were individually processed. In other words, the semiprecious stone, carneol, or more rarely amethyst, was engraved by hand. The same is true for amber and jet jewellery. Silver and gold jewellery and, in particular, engraved bracelets were mass produced by craftsmen, wherein artistic features can be noticed if they were individually made by a jeweller outside a typological series. Details of floor and wall mosaics are particularly significant. Tegula vermicula from the Roman villa in Verige Bay on one of the Brijuni Islands is especially distinguished as a unique example bearing the image of Dionysus. The composition “Punishment of Dirce” from an urban villa in Pula, a high-quality work of an antique mosaic maker, also has certain artistic qualities. Stone sculptures, especially portraits from the Republic era, and those of Antonia Minor and Agrippina Minor from Pula, members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, and the portraits of a woman and a man of the Antoninian dynasty from Plomin, are not numerous in Istria, but certainly have high artistic value. Funerary stone monuments range from awkward stonemasonry executions to a high artistic level seen in the reliefs of the mausoleum in Pula. All these groups of practical items and Roman monuments have been recovered mainly from necropolises (Pula, Medulin, Nesactium, Savudrija, Sv. Ivan Kornetski, and others), while individual finds of the stone and mosaic antique heritage have been recovered in Poreč, Pula, Nesactium, and Plomin.

Nothing perhaps might affect us as queerer, had we time to look into it, than this application of the same measure of value to such different pieces of property as old Persian carpets, say, and new human acquisitions; all the more indeed that the amiable man was not without an inkling, on his own side, that he was, as a taster of life, economically constructed.

It was all, at bottom, in him, the aesthetic principle, planted where it could burn with a cold, still flame; where it fed almost wholly on the material directly involved, on the idea (followed by appropriation) of plastic beauty, of the thing visibly perfect in its kind; where, in short, in spite of the general tendency of the [...] "devouring element" [...] to spread, the rest of his spiritual furniture, modest, scattered, and tended with unconscious care, escaped the consumption that in so many cases proceeds from the undue keeping-up of profane altar-fires.

40|$|White {{wines are}} liable to develop haze during storage and {{transport}} due to residual protein in the finished wine. Since haze in white wines is considered unacceptable, winemakers attempt to reduce the protein content prior to bottling {{through the use of}} fining agents such as bentonite. The use of bentonite is not without economic cost with the estimated annual impact to the New Zealand wine industry in the region of NZD 35 million. The optimum quantity of bentonite to be used is normally determined using a heat test in conjunction with empirical fining trials. During these tests the winemaker is required to conduct various haze comparisons. Since these assessments are difficult to perform visually, researchers recommend the use of suitable nephelometric instrumentation to ensure consistency and precision. Despite these recommendations, most winemakers have not purchased the necessary equipment; it is thought that cost is the primary deterrent. The overall goal of this project was to explore the relationships between nephelometry, digital imaging and human perception of haze in terms of thresholds and intensity. In addition, the feasibility of using digital imaging devices to make nephelometric measurements was to be investigated. A range of achromatic and yellow turbid suspensions were prepared by suspending synthetic polymer microspheres of diameter 0. 25 μm in aqueous solutions. Base wine stocks exhibiting high turbidity were prepared by heating commercial grade Chardonnay wine at 90 ˚ for two hours. A range of wine samples of varying turbidities were then prepared by dilution with untreated wine. Polymer microsphere suspensions and wine samples of varying visual haze were used in a series of sensory and instrumentation experiments. The sensory experiments examined haze detection thresholds and intensity scaling in human subjects. All evaluations took place in purpose designed sensory booths utilising overhead light emitting diode (LED) illumination. The booth backgrounds and sides were modified to present dark or light surrounds by hanging black or white linen on the walls. Samples were presented to human subjects in standard ISO tasting glasses and the subjects were permitted to manipulate the glass freely whilst they evaluated the samples. Turbidity measurements were made with a Hach 2100 P nephelometric device. Image data was captured using a modified Canon A 2300 digital still camera using 90 ˚ viewing geometries. Haze threshold determinations were made for achromatic and yellow microsphere suspensions using the Ascending Method of Limits (AML) and 3 -Alternate Forced Choice (3 AFC) methods. The lowest thresholds were found when achromatic suspensions were presented in a dark surround where individual thresholds ranged from 0. 21 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) to 1. 07 NTU. The highest thresholds were found when yellow suspensions were presented in a light surround where individual thresholds ranged from 1. 89 NTU to 25. 16 NTU. Heat treated Chardonnay wine samples were also evaluated in a dark surround where individual thresholds ranged from 0. 52 NTU to 1. 39 NTU. Visual haze intensities in achromatic and yellow microsphere suspensions were assessed by human subjects in dark and light surrounds using modulus Magnitude Estimation (ME). Sample luminance was determined by digitally photographing the samples under the same conditions employed for the ME evaluations. The perceived haze intensity with respect to luminance was found to follow generalised power or logarithmic functions similar to psycho-physical models commonly proposed for the response of the human visual system to brightness and lightness. The data exhibited a bi-segment nature indicative of surround and/or planar contrast induction. Similar responses were found for heat treated Chardonnay wine samples using turbidity as the independent variable. Turbidity values were measured for a range achromatic and yellow microsphere suspension samples. Luminance values were derived from digital images taken of ISO tasting glasses containing the same microsphere suspensions. The turbidity and luminance values were found to be linearly related below 50 NTU (dark surround, R 2 = 0. 9978; light surround, R 2 = 0. 9813). A subsequent experiment examined turbidity values and luminance data in achromatic and yellow microsphere suspension samples over a low range (< 6 NTU) by imaging the sample surface directly rather than through the <b>glass</b> <b>receptacle.</b> Turbidity vales and luminance data were again found to be linearly related (R 2 = 0. 9628). Measurements from the Hach 2100 P device and a luminance based measurement model were found to be mean and median equivalent for the low range experimental data...|$|R
