5000|$|A bookworm {{that has}} evolved in magical libraries. Because of the {{constant}} danger of running into a volume containing spells (which release thaumic radiation), the [...]303 caliber bookworm eats quickly. So quickly, in fact, {{that it has been}} known to <b>ricochet</b> off <b>walls</b> after boring through a shelf of books. It is the second fastest thing on the Disc (the fastest being Casanunda in a nunnery).|$|R
5000|$|Shortly before midnight, {{during a}} New Year party in Toronto on December 31, 1987, a fight broke out. Several people started {{throwing}} bottles including Joao DeSousa who threw a bottle that <b>ricocheted</b> off the <b>wall</b> and hit Teresa Santos in the forearm causing serious harm.|$|R
50|$|Established in 1998 as Shed Productions, {{the company}} floated on AIM (Alternative Investment Market) in March 2005. The group has grown {{significantly}} since flotation and to date, four award-winning media companies: <b>Ricochet,</b> Twenty Twenty, <b>Wall</b> to Wall and Outright Distribution have all joined the group. In 2010 it {{was bought by}} Time Warner.|$|R
50|$|Three {{days after}} {{the opening of the}} campaign, while reconnoitering the defile of Poserna-Rippach, Bessières was killed by a {{cannonball}} which <b>ricocheted</b> off a <b>wall</b> and hit him in the chest. He died instantly. Napoleon deeply felt the loss of one of his truest friends while the remaining Marshals considered it a good death for a soldier.|$|R
60|$|As a {{practical}} move, the action had flaws. The shots cannot have gone anywhere near their vague target. But as a demonstration, {{it was a}} wonderful success. The yard became suddenly full of dancing bullets. They struck the flagstones, bounded off, chipped the bricks of the far <b>wall,</b> <b>ricocheted</b> from those, buzzed in all directions, and generally behaved in a manner calculated to unman the stoutest hearted.|$|R
50|$|In the Cheez-It 355 at The Glen, on lap 64, Greg Biffle {{came up on}} Ryan Newman's front bumper, {{turning him}} into the outside {{retaining}} <b>wall.</b> His car <b>ricocheted</b> off the <b>wall</b> into McDowell's path, and {{with the force of}} the impact, the rear end housing was snapped, causing him to get airborne. His housing was then forced into the wall. The race was red-flagged, though both drivers were unharmed.|$|R
5000|$|Clinton-Lewinsky scandal {{reporting}} was {{chronicled in}} Time Magazine's 16 February 1998 [...] "Trial by Leaks" [...] cover story [...] "The Press And The Dress: The {{anatomy of a}} salacious leak, and how it <b>ricocheted</b> around the <b>walls</b> of the media echo chamber" [...] by Adam Cohen. This case was reviewed in depth by the Project for Excellence in Journalism in [...] "The Clinton/Lewinsky Story: How Accurate? How Fair?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{premise is}} simple. Unlike Bust a Move, {{there is no}} {{conventional}} time limit in Snood modes other than Time Attack; however, players must eliminate Snoods efficiently enough to prevent the gradually descending ceiling from crushing them. Many levels also require Snoods to be <b>ricocheted</b> off of <b>walls</b> {{in order to get}} them in the appropriate spot, which can be tricky. Snood requires considerable skill at approximating angles as well as strategy.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the years}} of 2003 to 2008, Landers looked back to his old text paintings, took their graphic nature and {{exploded}} it into spatial abstract paintings. “We’ve entered his skull conceptually and visually. Words and phrases <b>ricochet</b> off the <b>walls</b> of his cranium and we are among the brushstrokes.” These paintings have an echoing look where “thoughts emerge in your brain, they become clear and then recede back into the blurry distance.” “I {{was just trying to}} give thought a picture.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Held in {{spring-loaded}} pouches in {{the back}} of his costume, Dick carried a pair of eskrima clubs made from an unbreakable polymer that were wielded as both offensive and defensive weapons. Some depictions display these tools with the mechanism to shoot a grappling hook attached to a swing line, while, in other instances, they can act as [...] "line guns" [...] similar to the ones Batman uses. The clubs could also be thrown with such skill by Grayson (and possibly due to their design) that they would <b>ricochet</b> off <b>walls</b> and objects to hit multiple targets, then return to his hands. These clubs also have the capability to be linked together as well as grow in size to make a staff, as depicted in many series, such as Teen Titans Young Justice (Robin uses these weapons).|$|R
50|$|The {{ankle joint}} is {{flexible}} {{and able to}} rotate over 180 degrees, a trait helping make it an agile climber. Their considerable tail provides balance for negotiating narrow ledges and limbs, even allowing them to reverse directions by performing a cartwheel. Ringtails also can ascend narrow passages by stemming (pressing all feet on one wall and their back against the other or pressing both right feet on one wall and both left feet on the other), and wider cracks or openings by <b>ricocheting</b> between the <b>walls.</b>|$|R
50|$|On defense, Walker had {{extensive}} knowledge {{of where to}} play for each hitter, what the pitcher was going to throw, and where to position himself accordingly. He understands how to read the path and angle of the ball and how it <b>ricocheted</b> off the <b>wall.</b> His arm strength and accuracy often made it intimidating for baserunners to take extra bases. He is adept at mimicking catching long fly balls and line drives {{that he was actually}} unable to catch, often fooling hitters into settling for singles when they could have taken extra bases.|$|R
50|$|Akai Gurley, a 28-year-old African-American man, was {{fatally shot}} on November 20, 2014, in Brooklyn, New York City, United States, by a New York City Police Department officer. Two police officers, patrolling {{stairwells}} in the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA)'s Louis H. Pink Houses in East New York, Brooklyn, entered a pitch-dark, unlit stairwell, one of them, Officer Peter Liang, 27, with his firearm drawn. Gurley {{and his girlfriend}} entered the seventh-floor stairwell, fourteen steps below them. The shooting was declared an accidental discharge; the bullet <b>ricocheted</b> off the <b>wall</b> and Gurley was fatally struck once in the chest.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method used}} to turn red blocks white is {{to push them}} into the walls. Although {{touching}} a red block directly causes you to lose points, you can indirectly move them by pushing a white block into a red block and pushing both. Jostling red blocks, either by making them {{fall to the ground}} or dropping blocks onto them from a significant height, will also convert them to white blocks. Each red block you turn white earns you ten points, but you can earn additional points by <b>ricocheting</b> bullets off <b>walls</b> before they strike the block. The gains are significant, allowing you to earn up to 300 points per block converted.|$|R
50|$|On 9 March 1983, two Armenian gunmen {{opened fire}} with small {{firearms}} at Galip Balkar's auto, which {{stopped for a}} red light at a major downtown intersection in Belgrade. Balkar and his chauffeur Necati Kaya were wounded, {{the condition of the}} ambassador being critical. The two assailants then attempted to run away from the scene, and killed a Yugoslav student, Željko Milivojević, who tried to prevent their escape. Two Yugoslav security agents in the area chased them and shots were exchanged. The gunmen wounded one of the agents, Slobodan Brajević. Another shot aimed at Brajević had <b>ricocheted</b> off a <b>wall</b> and slightly wounded an office worker, Zorica Solotić.|$|R
5000|$|Ricochet has the mutant {{power of}} superhuman agility, {{enabling}} him to leap great distances. He has incredible reflexes and coordination which, combined with his leaping powers, {{allow him to}} seemingly bounce off <b>walls</b> (<b>ricochet,</b> as it were). Ricochet's mutant powers also give him a [...] "Danger Sense" [...] that functions much like Spider-Man's [...] "Spider-Sense". Thanks to Hornet, Ricochet has special throwing discs, which he stores on {{the sleeves of his}} jacket. His original discs could bounce off walls and targets with incredible force. Hornet later gave Ricochet discs that could explode on impact. Ricochet's super reflexes and coordination enable him to throw his discs with amazing speed and accuracy.|$|R
25|$|He {{began his}} 2009 {{season at the}} 2009 Daytona 500, he was {{involved}} in a wreck on lap 124 when Dale Earnhardt Jr. swerved into Brian Vickers. Vickers shot up the track and hit the <b>wall,</b> <b>ricocheting</b> into Denny Hamlin, who came down into Busch. He then spun into the grass along with eight other drivers including his brother Kyle. Busch made numerous pit stops to repair the car, and was able to finish tenth. Kurt was one of the many ones that believed that Dale Jr.'s contact was intentional and Kurt joined Earnhardt's fans, the drivers and owners in calling NASCAR to penalize Earnhardt, {{for the rest of the}} race but this was not granted.|$|R
5000|$|The figure {{moves through}} the maze until he finds the exit or is killed (except in Cloudy Mountain, the final maze, where the game {{immediately}} ends on gathering both pieces of the Crown). While in the maze, monsters attack the player. The difficulty of each mountain determines how many monsters are on the map and also which [...] "boss" [...] monster is present. The player can kill the monsters by firing arrows with the bow (using the numbered key-pad, {{in a similar manner}} to the Tron Deadly Discs game), which can <b>ricochet</b> off <b>walls</b> to hit their targets and potentially injure the player. Rats, bats, and spiders are killed with a single hit, but [...] "boss" [...] monsters take two arrows to kill. These boss monsters include giant snakes, demons, and dragons. It is possible for several to be present in one maze. The [...] "final bosses" [...] are a pair of winged dragons within Cloudy Mountain, each of whom guard one half of the Crown. These winged dragons take three arrows to kill. Indestructible and slow-moving [...] "blobs" [...] are also often present.|$|R
50|$|As {{they were}} alone in the room, it is unclear how Alfonso was shot, but {{according}} to Josefina Carolo, dressmaker to Juan Carlos's mother, Juan Carlos pointed the pistol at Alfonso and pulled the trigger, unaware that it was loaded. Bernardo Arnoso, a Portuguese friend of Juan Carlos, also said that Juan Carlos fired the pistol not knowing that it was loaded, and adding that the bullet <b>ricocheted</b> off a <b>wall,</b> hitting Alfonso in the face. Helena Matheopoulos, a Greek author who spoke with Juan Carlos's sister Pilar, said that Alfonso had been {{out of the room and}} when he returned and pushed the door open, the door knocked Juan Carlos in the arm, causing him to fire the pistol.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the new [...] "class" [...] system, new level designs were added, including the possibility of encountering them in altered ways by having the play-field turned in steps of 90°. Other new features included the enemy [...] "It", which upon contact would make a player [...] "It" [...] and draw all enemies towards him/her. The only way to release this curse is by touching another player or entering the exit, turning any level containing [...] "It" [...] into a fantasy filled game of tag. Other notable additions include the ability to <b>ricochet</b> shots off <b>walls</b> {{by means of a}} special pick-up, acid puddles that caused large, predetermined amounts of damage and a large dragon which would occupy multiple squares and require multiple hits to destroy.|$|R
50|$|Having {{started in}} 1990 season without a driver, Jourdain {{returned}} to Andale for the Indianapolis 500. During qualifying, he wrecked his Lola-Buick T89/00, {{and was forced}} to try to qualifying the space car, a Lola-Buick T88/00. It was in this car; he <b>ricocheted</b> off three <b>walls</b> and demolished it, seriously injuring himself in the process. He underwent surgery to remove his spleen. He returned to open-wheeled racing the following season, securing a drive with A. J. Foyt Enterprises, and became the first non-US-born driver to race for four-time Indianapolis 500 winner A. J. Foyt, starting in the Toyota Long Beach Grand Prix. He raced once more with Foyt, in the Indy 500, but did not finish either of these races due to gearbox gremlins. After the race at Indianapolis, Jourdain retired from international motor sport.|$|R
50|$|Hayaat is very determined, and {{sometimes}} stubborn. However, {{there is a}} hole in her heart. A few years before, she and her friend Maysaa were together when a bomb exploded. Fragments <b>ricocheted</b> off a <b>wall</b> towards Hayaat, causing wounds that would leave permanent scars. She turned to see her best friend {{in a pool of}} blood, dead. Though Hayaat is strong, she is also very troubled. She feels guilt at her friend's death, and also sadness. Frequently, she overhears her mother and grandmother talking, saying Who will marry her with those scars? Hayaat is traumatised by her past, but learns to be strong {{in the face of the}} war-torn Middle East, where she finds what it truly means to have support, and to have courage in the face of oppression.|$|R
50|$|The {{defendants}} {{also argued}} that Liang pulling out his gun was still falling {{in the line of}} protocol, because “lack of lighting is commonly perceived as a sign of criminal activity.” Furthermore, the light, as an answer to Kenneth P. Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney’s, request, and had been out of service for number of days without reparation. after Liang’s bullet <b>ricocheted</b> off the <b>wall</b> and strike Akai Gurley in the chest, officer Liang and his partner Landau did not try to save the dying person who lied in the blood pool of his own. Instead, Liang and Landau went back to the hallway debating who should report and explain to their higher-ups and, in the meantime, Liang texted to his union PBA (Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association) for advice. x` CPR was not performed while time passed.|$|R
50|$|Initially confident, {{the narrator}} becomes {{increasingly}} uneasy in the room. He attempts to conquer his fear by lighting candles, but keeping the candles lit in the draughty room becomes an ongoing battle. Each time a candle is snuffed out, the narrator's fear increases. He begins {{to imagine that}} the drafts are guided by a malevolent intelligence. As the narrator's fear reaches a crescendo, he stumbles onto a large piece of furniture (possibly the bed), and <b>ricochets</b> off the <b>walls,</b> in a blind panic; hitting his head and eventually falling unconscious. The caretakers, who find him in the morning, feel vindicated when the narrator agrees that the room is haunted. They are eager to hear a description of the phantom, but he surprises them by explaining that there is no ghost residing in the room. The room is haunted by fear itself.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the N-Strike and Dart Tag lines, {{which use}} foam darts, Vortex uses XLR (Xtra Long Range) discs [...] - green, white or glow-in-the-dark plastic discs wrapped in foam. These discs {{are capable of}} {{traveling}} at greater distances than darts fired from original N-Strike blasters (up to 65 feet) and also <b>ricocheting</b> off of <b>walls.</b> As with other current Nerf and Super Soaker blasters, the Vortex blasters are designed with tactical rails to accommodate scopes and other accessories. The Praxis and Nitron have accessories that are also compatible with other Nerf blasters. To further differentiate from the yellow-colored N-Strike and Dart Tag blasters, {{as well as the}} blue and orange or blue and orange and white Elite blasters, the Vortex blasters are colored kelly green and vermilion except the Pyragon, Revonix360, and Diatron, which are colored white, gray and vermilion.|$|R
5000|$|The lawmen {{assembled}} a five-man force in two cars on April 13 to confront what they suspected were bootleggers {{living in the}} garage apartment. Though taken by surprise, Clyde was noted for remaining cool under fire. He, Jones, and Buck quickly killed Detective McGinnis and fatally wounded Constable Harryman. During the escape from the apartment, Parker laid down covering fire with her BAR, forcing Highway Patrol Sergeant G. B. Kahler to duck behind a large oak tree while [...]30 caliber bullets struck the other side, forcing wood splinters into the sergeant's face. Parker {{got into the car}} with the others. They slowed enough to pull in Blanche Barrow from the street, where she was pursuing her dog Snow Ball. The surviving officers later testified that their side had fired only fourteen rounds in the conflict, but one hit Jones on the side, one struck Clyde and was deflected by his suitcoat button, and one grazed Buck after <b>ricocheting</b> off a <b>wall.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Identifying collision-free trajectories in environments with dynamic {{obstacles}} is {{a significant}} challenge. However, many pertinent problems occur in dynamic environments, e. g., flight coordination, satel-lite navigation, autonomous driving, and household robotics. Stochas-tic reachable (SR) sets assure collision-free trajectories with a certain likelihood in dynamic environments, but are infeasible for multiple mov-ing obstacles as the computation scales exponentially {{in the number of}} Degrees of Freedom (DoF) of the relative robot-obstacle state space. Other methods, such as artificial potential fields (APF), roadmap-based methods, and tree-based techniques can scale well with the number of obstacles. However, these methods usually have low success rates in en-vironments with a large number of obstacles. In this paper, we propose a method to integrate formal SR sets with ad-hoc APFs for multiple moving obstacles. The success rate of this method is 30 % higher than two related methods for moving obstacle avoidance, a roadmap-based technique that uses a SR bias and an APF technique without a SR bias, reaching over 86 % success in an enclosed space with 100 moving obstacles that <b>ricochet</b> off the <b>walls.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Akai Gurley, 28 years old, {{was visiting}} {{his girlfriend and}} getting his hair braided before Thanksgiving. He entered the {{stairwell}} on the 7th floor, below Officers Shaun Landau and Peter Liang, who were patrolling the pitch-dark stairwell with no lights. According to the prosecutors, seconds earlier, Officer Liang, who is left-handed, pulled out his flashlight {{with his right hand}} and unholstered his 9mm Glock with his left. He then shoved open the stairwell door with his right shoulder with his gun drawn pointed down the way police officers are trained. It appeared neither side knew the other was there and no words were exchanged, according to authorities. Liang's gun accidentally discharged as {{he opened the door and}} the bullet <b>ricocheted</b> off the <b>wall</b> and struck Gurley once in the chest, who died within a few minutes. Upon entering, Liang said he heard [...] "a quick sound" [...] to his left which startled him. He turned left and [...] "it just went off when my whole body tensed up", Liang testified. It was reported that Gurley actually ran after hearing the gunshot, and didn’t realize he was bleeding until collapsing on the fifth floor.|$|R
5000|$|Ricochet (Johnny Gallo): A mutant with superhuman agility, {{enabling}} him to leap great distances. He has incredible reflexes, which, {{combined with}} his leaping powers, {{enable him to}} seemingly bounce off <b>walls</b> (<b>ricochet,</b> as it were). His mutant powers also give him a [...] "Danger Sense," [...] which functions much like Spider-Man's [...] "Spider-Sense." [...] His jacket sleeves hold up to eight throwing discs. Ricochet originally used discs that he rebounded off walls, much as he himself did. Hornet later provided Ricochet with special [...] "gimmick" [...] discs, which can return to the thrower after a short time, or even self-destruct. Johnny's mother was murdered when Johnny {{was in his early}} teens. Much later, he discovered that her killer was Orphan-Maker. Johnny had a troubled relationship with his cold and uncaring father. Ricochet and Hornet returned to fighting crime at one point after the Slingers dissolved, but Hornet's death prompted Johnny to seek help to give up the costumed life. He joined the Los Angeles-based [...] "teenage superhero recovery group" [...] Excelsior, where, despite the group's mission statement, he has repeatedly found himself fighting alongside other members of the group against local threats.|$|R
5000|$|The {{assassination}} {{occurred at}} the Seoul National Theater of Korea during an Independence Day ceremony. Mun intended to shoot Park in the theater lobby. However, his view was obstructed, and {{he was forced to}} enter and be seated near the back of the theater. During Park's address, he attempted to get closer to the President but inadvertently fired his Smith & Wesson [...]38-caliber revolver prematurely, injuring himself. Having alerted security, he then ran down the theater aisle firing wildly. His second bullet hit {{the left side of the}} podium from which Park was delivering his speech. The third bullet was a misfire. His fourth bullet struck Yuk Young-soo in the head, seriously wounding her. His last bullet went through a flag decorating the rear of the stage. A bullet fired by Park Jong-gyu, one of the President's security, in response to Mun's attack, <b>ricocheted</b> off a <b>wall</b> and killed a high school student, Jang Bong-hwa. Immediately following the capture of Mun, Park resumed his scheduled speech despite the wounding of his wife and her being carried from the stage. Following its completion he picked up his wife's handbag and shoes and left.|$|R

5000|$|After {{finishing}} 33rd in {{the first}} race of the 2013 NASCAR Nationwide Series, Clements was suspended indefinitely by NASCAR on February 27, 2013. The sanctioning body stated that the suspension was due to violations of the NASCAR Code of Conduct, as defined in Section 7-5 of the sanctioning body's rulebook, as well as Section 12-1, actions detrimental to stock car racing. Clements, {{in an interview with}} ESPN was later quoted as saying, [...] "When you say 'racial' remark, it wasn't used to describe anybody or anything. So that's all I'm going to say to that. And it really wasn't. I was describing racing, and the word I used was incorrect and I shouldn't have said it. It shouldn't be used at all." [...] The MTV editor who had the conversation with Clements, Marty Beckerman, confirmed that Clements said a phrase which included the [...] "n-word". Clements sat out two races and returned {{for the rest of the}} season. His season was highlighted by top ten finishes at the huge Talladega Superspeedway tri-oval and the series' inaugural race at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.After a number of equipment setbacks in the 2014 NASCAR Nationwide Series, Clements had a brief moment in the top 5 in the Aaron’s 312 at Talladega Superspeedway on May 3, 2014, before a crash forced him out with four laps to go. Ryan Blaney, who was in second at the time, <b>ricocheted</b> off the <b>wall</b> into Clements, and sent his car hard into the wall. At the Gardner Denver 200 at Road America, Clements recorded a then career-best sixth-place finish. 2015 was a decent season for Clements despite a best finish of 10th at Dover and a handful of poor finishes. [...] At Talladega in 2016, Clements led laps under caution and recorded his first Xfinity top five finish, a fourth.|$|R
