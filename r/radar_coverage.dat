5|$|Although most U.S. {{aircraft}} losses {{continued to}} be inflicted by anti-aircraft fire, U.S. Air Force F-105s and Navy A-4 Skyhawks increasingly encountered SAMs and MiGs. North Vietnamese fighters also became a particular problem {{because of the lack}} of <b>radar</b> <b>coverage</b> in the Red River Delta region, which allowed the MiGs to surprise the strike forces. Airborne early warning aircraft had difficulty detecting the fighters at low altitudes and the aircraft themselves were difficult to see visually.|$|E
5|$|The FAA {{was aware}} {{at this point}} that there was an {{emergency}} on board the airplane. By this time, Flight 11 had already crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and Flight 175 was known to have been hijacked and was within minutes of striking the South Tower. After learning of this second hijacking involving an American Airlines aircraft and the hijacking involving United Airlines, American Airlines' executive vice president Gerard Arpey ordered a nationwide ground stop for the airline. The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, as well as American Airlines dispatchers, made several failed attempts to contact the aircraft. At the time the airplane was hijacked, it was flying over an area of limited <b>radar</b> <b>coverage.</b> With air controllers unable to contact the flight by radio, an Indianapolis official declared that the Boeing 757 had possibly crashed at 09:09.|$|E

5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the stealth characteristics is difficult to gauge. The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of the aircraft's frontal or side area {{from the perspective of}} a static radar. When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a completely different set of angles and surface area, potentially increasing radar observability. Furthermore, the F-22's stealth contouring and radar absorbent materials are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars such as weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the F-22 due to its physical size. However, such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and have low precision. Additionally, while faint or fleeting radar contacts make defenders aware that a stealth aircraft is present, reliably vectoring interception to attack the aircraft is much more challenging. According to the USAF an F-22 surprised an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that was attempting to intercept an American UAV, despite Iran's claim of having military VHF <b>radar</b> <b>coverage</b> over the Persian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|The Yawata raid {{revealed}} serious {{shortcomings in}} Japan's air defenses. While the 19th Air Brigade initially {{claimed to have}} shot down eight B-29s and damaged a further four, it was soon determined that {{only two of the}} bombers had been destroyed. This loss ratio was considered too low to defeat attacks on the home islands. The raid demonstrated that Japan had too few air bases and not enough aircraft were available for night operations. It was also found that the Toryu fighter was not well suited to intercepting B-29s as it was slower than the bombers, too lightly armed and most aircraft lacked radar. While the air raid alert system had proved successful in this instance, the radars which detected the American aircraft had been unable to determine their altitude and it was decided that there was a need to further expand <b>radar</b> <b>coverage.</b> The performance of the 131st Anti Aircraft Regiment during the raid was judged to be so poor that its commander was transferred to Manchuria. News reports of the Yawata raid and successful U.S. landing at Saipan on the same day also indicated to Japanese civilians that the war was not going well. In response to the raid Japanese Government ministers urged families living the country's four major cities to evacuate their children to rural areas.|$|E

Flight370 was a scheduled commercial flight with 227 passengers and 12 crew which departed Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at 0:41 and was scheduled to land in Beijing, China at 6:30China Standard Time (6:30MYT; 22:30UTC, 7 March). Malaysia has worked in conjunction with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to co-ordinate the analysis, which has also involved the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Inmarsat, and US National Transportation Safety Board, among others. Others have also made efforts to analyse the satellite communications, albeit challenged by a lack of publicly available information for several months after the disappearance. On 29July 2015, debris was discovered on Réunion Island which was later confirmed to come from Flight 370; it is the first physical evidence that Flight370 ended in the Indian Ocean.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aiming at the <b>radar</b> {{vertical}} detection <b>coverage</b> limitation {{given by}} manufacturing factories, this paper put forwards a new characterization method of radar’s air surveillance coverage: {{it is the}} projection distance of furthest detection point for different RCS targets at different altitudes, which can directly show radar’s quick response to the attack action launched by fighter. Then this paper gives the calculating method of coverage characterization method, and calculates <b>radar</b> detection <b>coverage</b> of typical medium-low altitude search. The result shows that the detection ability to penetration fighter is weak for high altitude and below 300 m altitude, especially for the high altitude penetration stealth fighter...|$|R
25|$|The vast {{northern}} {{borders of}} the Soviet Union were wide open in many places during the early Cold War years with little defensive <b>radar</b> <b>coverage,</b> with limited detection capability. RB-50 aircraft of the 55th SRW flew many sorties along the periphery, and where necessary into the interior. Initially, there was little opposition from the Soviet forces as <b>radar</b> <b>coverage</b> was limited and, if the overflying aircraft were detected, the World War II era Soviet fighters could not intercept the RB-50s at their high altitude.|$|E

30|$|During summer 2002, a {{versatile}} Doppler radar was installed {{close to the}} village Saura on the North Norwegian island Andøya (69.14 ^∘N, 16.02 ^∘E), its current characteristics are summarized in Table  1. This radar is meant for improved studies of the polar middle atmosphere (Singer et al. 2008) with focus on the investigation of processes in the lowest part of the ionosphere, namely the D region, from approximately 60 – 95  km altitude. The lower ionosphere shows similar behavior to observations with its predecessor radar MF-Andenes operated at 1.98  MHz just 20  km north of Saura, which was used in several studies. The Saura radar performs observations throughout the year due to its relative low frequency and the sufficient amount of electron number density permitting radar backscatter. The lower boundary of the D region and thus the <b>radar’s</b> <b>coverage,</b> however, is highly dependent on the ionization level at the given time, mainly controlled by the solar and geomagnetic activity. During periods of enhanced ionization in the D region, the Saura radar is capable of providing wind measurements down to 50  km altitude as we will show later in Fig.  8, where in general no other instruments may provide winds of equivalent temporal and spatial coverage as well as resolution.|$|R
40|$|The {{multistatic radar}} {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} is composed of a transmitter, placed in a high altitude site, at least four receivers distributed in a low altitude area and a central processing station. The transmitter emits a FMCW signal in the air which is reflected by the natural environment and the targets inside the <b>radar's</b> <b>coverage</b> area. The line of sight signal and the collected signal scattered from the surrounding objects are collected from each receiver and a processing algorithm is applied to measure range/doppler and separate the moving air vehicles from the stationary targets (clutter). The targets' range/doppler measurements from every receiver are sent to a central processing station where data fusion of the distributed measurements is performed. A list of the existing tracks is maintained, updated and managed, while deghosting is also applied to remove the pseudo-targets generated from geometrical ambiguities. The main goal of this multistatic radar system is {{to take advantage of the}} bistatic RCS to increase the probability of detection of targets with very low monostatic RCS. In addition, the transmitter's task is limited only to produce the desired waveform while the receiver performs a totally passive process, which makes it less vulnerable to intercept. Finally, it must be noticed that proper techniques are used for the estimation of the targets' characteristics while the receiver's operation remains simple and low cost...|$|R

25|$|Upon re-formation of the Aerospace Defense Command in 1951 {{to oversee}} the nation's {{developing}} surveillance radar network, there was concern that shore-based radars along the east coast provided insufficient warning time. A 1952 report from MIT's Lincoln Laboratory looked into the possibility of extending <b>radar</b> <b>coverage</b> by building platforms in the Atlantic using offshore oil drilling technology. They concluded that a set of such platforms, equipped with radars, could extend coverage several hundred miles offshore, giving half an hour additional warning of an attack. Funding for design and construction of the towers was approved in January 1954.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of inland <b>radar</b> <b>coverage,</b> 1st AA Division's Chief Signals Officer, Lt-Col G.C.

It was later replaced as searchlight control (SLC) and gunlaying (GL) radar systems were introduced.|$|E
25|$|To {{mitigate}} {{this lack}} of low-level <b>radar</b> <b>coverage,</b> the Air Force also operates four Plessey Tactical Mobile Radar (TMR) systems (in service with 142 Squadron SAAF). These systems can cover altitudes below 700metres, {{but they have a}} shorter range than the Umlindi systems, at 150km. The deployment of these systems require the use of a MAN 8×8 truck (one per system), one or two light vehicles for command and control purposes, a water tanker, a diesel bowser and a technical workshop vehicle. These systems can operate 24 hours a day with less than 20 personnel (including personnel from other AFMDW units like the Mobile Communications Unit and 501 Squadron).|$|E

25|$|The loss of Tower 4, {{together}} with the increasing emphasis on ICBMs as the predominant threat, led a reassessment of the remaining towers.

Both platforms were expected to be returned to shore for scrap, but Tower 2 sank and could not be recovered. Tower 3 was then filled with foam before being knocked off its support, and it was successfully returned to shore and dismantled. The wreckage of Towers 2 and 4 remains in place on the ocean floor. <b>Radar</b> <b>coverage</b> was taken over by alterations to EC-121 airborne early warning flights based out of Otis Air Force Base.|$|E
25|$|In peacetime the Swiss Air Force {{does not}} {{maintain}} 24/7 operational readiness status, {{due to the}} limited budget and staff available.
