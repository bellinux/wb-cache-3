40|$|The salient {{aspects of}} the {{theoretical}} modeling of a conventional triaxial test (CTC) of a cohesionless granular medium with stress and strain rate loading are described. Included are a controllable gravitational body force and provision for low confining pressure and/or very low intergranular stress. The modeling includes rational, analytic, and numerical phases, all {{in various stages of}} development. The numerical evolutions of theoretical models will be used in final design stages and in the analysis of the experimental data. In this the experimental design stage, it is of special interest to include in the candidate considerations every anomaly found in preliminary terrestrial experimentation. Most of the anomalies will be eliminated by design or enhanced for measurement as the project progresses. The main aspect of design being not the physical apparatus but the type and trajectories of loading elected. The major considerations that have been treated are: appearance and growth of local surface aberrations, stress-power coefficients, strain types, optical strain, <b>radial</b> <b>bead</b> migration, and measures of rotation for the proper stress flux...|$|E

On {{either side of the}} keel the interstices are wider than usual. The radials are irregular oblique wave-like folds, twenty-two on the body whorl, which raise beads on the keel rows, and there cease abruptly. On the base incipient <b>radials</b> <b>bead</b> the inner spirals.|$|R
40|$|Intermolecular {{structures}} of complexes formed between a charged polymer and a spherical and oppositely charged macroion {{have been studied}} by employing the primitive model solved by Monte Carlo simulations. The strong-complex case involving a polyion and a macroion with equal absolute charges and without small ions was considered. The influence of the polyion flexibility with a bare persistence length ranging from 7 to 1000 Å for four different systems characterized by different polyion linear charge densities and macroion sizes has been examined. <b>Radial</b> distributions, polyion <b>bead</b> complexation probabilities, loop, tail, and train characteristics, and energetic analysis have been performed. The strongest and most compact complex, involving a collapsed polyion wrapping the macroion, was formed for a semiflexible chain. As the stiffness was increased, this state {{was transformed into a}} range of different structures comprising “tennis ball seam”-like, solenoid, multiloop (“rosette”), and single-loop arrangements as well as structures involving only a single polyion-macroion contact region...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a microfluidic-based strategy is presented for investigating the functional behaviour of hydrogel spherical beads which are employed in the clinic as embolic agents and drug delivery systems {{for the treatment of}} hypervascularised tumours and arteriovenous malformations. For this purpose, biomimetic microchannel networks were designed and fabricated by micromilling technology. Microdevices architecture reproduced characteristic features of microcirculatory arteriolar systems. The miniaturisation allowed for coupling with microscope-based technology and in situ visualisation of particles/cells behaviour. The flow dynamics of red blood cells (RBCs) suspensions within the aforementioned biomimetic microfluidic devices was investigated, by using in-house developed micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (?-PIV) methods and image analysis techniques to quantify fluid velocity fields, cell-free layer width and RBCs spatial distribution. Results demonstrated the potential of the developed microfluidic devices for reliably reproducing peculiar properties of RBCs flow behaviour within human microcirculatory systems, including the relationship between cell-depletion layer width and microvessel diameter, and the dependence of RBCs distribution on the local Reynolds number. These findings opened the way for the application of the developed microfluidic devices as a biomimetic platform for investigating the performance of embolic beads. The flow behaviour of hydrogel beads within biomimetic microfluidic environments was investigated by adopting a two-steps approach, in which beads hydrodynamics was firstly studied within straight microchannels (Step I) and subsequently within network-like microchannel constructs (Step II). For this purpose, microscopy-based analysis techniques were developed in order to quantify <b>bead</b> <b>radial</b> position and axial velocity. Results demonstrated that bead flow behaviour depended on a complex interplay between the governing physical parameters, which included fluid rheology, fluid inertia (i. e., Reynolds number) and particle relative dimension (i. e., degree of confinement). Notably, it has been demonstrated that for a given combination of such parameters beads underwent oscillatory dynamics which have been thoroughly characterised experimentally. Further, beads partitioning at bifurcations, penetration efficacy and spatial location of the embolic events within biomimetic microchannel networks were investigated. The experimental observations presented here can provide relevant insight into the mechanisms governing the spatial distribution of embolic beads within tumour vascular systems. Finally, the spatiotemporal dynamics of drug elution from hydrogel embolic beads was investigated within the aforementioned biomimetic microchannel networks. Both on-chip analysis and off-chip analysis techniques were developed for quantifying the kinetics of drug elution and the amount of eluted drug from single embolic beads. Results revealed that drug elution from hydrogel embolic beads depended on the local hydrodynamics at the embolic site and on the location of the embolic event within the vascular network (i. e., proximal or distal embolisation). A numerical model was developed in order to better understand the role played by flow dynamics environment on the spatial distribution of the eluted drug at biomimetic bifurcations. In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} have established that microfluidics could be potentially employed as an alternative to animal models for investigating the performance and functional behaviour of hydrogel beads used in cancer therapy and targeted drug delivery...|$|R
