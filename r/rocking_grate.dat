5|$|The {{final two}} {{locomotives}} Nos. 6256 and 46257 Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S and City of Salford were given many new features. In order {{to raise the}} mileage between general overhauls from 70,000 to 100,000, measures were taken to decrease wear to the axle bearings and hornguides {{through the use of}} roller bearings and manganese steel linings. Other modifications included further superheating area, a redesigned rear frame and cast steel trailing truck, <b>rocking</b> <b>grate,</b> hopper ashpan and redesigned cab-sides.|$|E
25|$|The Class GL had a <b>rocking</b> <b>grate</b> and {{self-cleaning}} hopper ashpan {{with water}} and steam sprayers to dampen down the ash {{to prevent it from}} entering axle boxes, motion areas and other friction-sensitive places. They had self-cleaning type smokeboxes and their axle boxes were grease-lubricated.|$|E
500|$|The {{basic design}} of the [...] "Britannias" [...] owed much to LMS {{building}} practices, especially when considering Riddles' previous career with the said railway. [...] However, {{in keeping with the}} necessity to follow best practice in creating standardised steam locomotives, they utilised a variation of both boiler and trailing wheel of the Merchant Navy Class, while weight was kept within the margins laid down by the Light Pacifics, all of which were designed by Oliver Bulleid. [...] The firebox was also similar in having a <b>rocking</b> <b>grate,</b> which allowed the fire to be rebuilt without stopping the locomotive, removing both ash and clinker on the move; but unlike the SR Pacifics, the inner firebox was constructed of copper instead of steel, and lacked thermic syphons. A self-cleaning smokebox was used, which enabled ash to flow into the atmosphere, reducing the workload of the engine cleaner {{at the end of a}} working day. A single chimney was placed on top of the smokebox, which was unusual for a [...] "Pacific" [...] type of locomotive. This was because the blastpipe was designed by S.O. Ell at Swindon Works, who claimed that [...] "better results could be obtained from a well-designed single chimney than some of the previous double chimney arrangements". The [...] "Britannias" [...] had [...] driving wheels, a compromise that took into account the intended mixed-traffic role they were designed for. This meant that they were large enough for sustained fast running with heavy passenger trains, yet small enough to allow them to undertake more mundane tasks such as freight haulage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>grates</b> {{are placed}} {{directly}} above the burner and {{are designed to}} hold lava rock or ceramic briquettes. These materials serve a dual purpose - they protect the burner from drippings which can accelerate {{the deterioration of the}} burner, and they disperse the heat from the burner more evenly throughout the grill.|$|R
50|$|Heat shields {{are also}} known as burner shields, heat plates, heat tents, {{radiation}} shields, or heat angles. They serve the same purpose as a <b>rock</b> <b>grate</b> and <b>rock,</b> protecting the burner from corrosive meat drippings and dispersing heat. They are more common in newer grills. Heat shields are lighter, easier to replace and harbor less bacteria than rocks.|$|R
50|$|The LMS had various elderly tank {{engines and}} the {{operating}} department required a new small class 2 locomotive to replace them. Noting that the Great Western Railway 4500 and 4575 Classes of 2-6-2T ('Prairie') had been successful, George Ivatt designed the new engine type incorporating self-emptying ashpans and <b>rocking</b> <b>grates</b> which were labour-saving devices. A tender version, the Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 was also produced. The LMS classified them as 2P, but BR preferred the classification 2MT.|$|R
50|$|In particular, the Standard design {{incorporated}} features {{designed to}} make disposal easier: a self-cleaning smokebox and a <b>rocking</b> <b>grate</b> removed the necessity for crews to undertake dirty and strenuous duties {{at the end of}} a long shift.|$|E
50|$|The Class GL had a <b>rocking</b> <b>grate</b> and {{self-cleaning}} hopper ashpan {{with water}} and steam sprayers to dampen down the ash {{to prevent it from}} entering axle boxes, motion areas and other friction-sensitive places.

50|$|As {{was typical}} Hungarian practice, {{the first two}} {{locomotives}} were built with steel fireboxes. To cope with the high ash production of Eastern European coal, a <b>rocking</b> <b>grate</b> was fitted. The later two locomotives were fitted with copper fireboxes, owing to cracking problems with the steel. The class was considered successful, although the shadow of World War II meant that no further examples were built, even though Hungary did not enter the war until 1941.|$|E
5000|$|They had a {{whole range}} of {{features}} such as piston valves, roller-type big-end and side-rod bearings, manganese steel axle-box and horn plate liners, hopper ashpans, self-cleaning smokeboxes, <b>rocking</b> <b>grates</b> and Lambets wet sanding. Steel fireboxes were used as well as [...] "Owens" [...] patent poppet valve and balanced regulator valves. As was usual for short-journey locomotives they were not fitted with superheating, as short journeys allow little time for the superheater elements to reach working temperature.|$|R
60|$|It was as Bertie had said. Scattered {{among the}} rocks were {{a score of}} ingots. They had lost their brilliancy, but shone with a dull copperish hue, with bright gleams here and there where <b>rocks</b> had <b>grated</b> against them. Putting one hand on a block of rock he lifted one of them with the other.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had Belpaire fireboxes with firebar <b>rocking</b> finger <b>grates.</b> To {{accommodate the}} wide and deep firebox, Hendrie {{made use of}} a bridle casting {{along the same lines}} as the one which was first introduced by H.M. Beatty on his Cape Government Railways (CGR) 6th Class 2-6-2 of 1903, later the Class 6Y on the South African Railways (SAR).|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had {{a copper}} firebox, with a <b>rocking</b> <b>grate</b> with drop plates and a hopper-style ash-pan. The boiler {{was equipped with}} 3 in Ramsbottom safety valves, while its feedwater was supplied by two Cape pattern Gresham & Craven's no. 8 injectors. The engine was equipped with a Nathan double-sight feed cylinder lubricator, Gresham & Craven's patent steam sanding gear and one 3 in and one 4 in Star chime no. 3 whistles.|$|E

50|$|The inner firebox was {{of steel}} and was fitted with five 3 in {{diameter}} arch tubes, which supported the brick arch. The <b>rocking</b> <b>grate,</b> with two drop-grates, was actuated by a steam shaker. As was the practice with Watson Standard boilers, the hopper type ashpan was secured to the main frames instead of to the boiler foundation ring, with a 4 in air gap all round. Drench pipes were fitted to facilitate cleaning and {{the bottom of the}} ashpan was fitted with a hand-operated sliding door.|$|E
50|$|The Cabot Rock Monument is an inscribed <b>rock</b> {{located at}} <b>Grates</b> Cove, Newfoundland, Canada. The {{monument}} {{to what is}} believed to be bear the names of the John Cabot and his youngest son Sancius.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{locomotives}} {{were designed}} and built according to Soviet designs, the American plants implemented {{some of their own}} technologies, as well as changes in design of individual units. Thus, the plant Baldwin locomotives #2624 to Alco #2200 were issued with <b>rocking</b> <b>grates.</b> Most of the Еа and Ем locomotives were issued with bar frames, but some were released with cast frames, which included not only a sidewall with better fixtures, but cylinders integrated with the support for the boiler, the buffer timber with support for the truck, smaller tender coupling, brackets for balancing the spring suspension and brake support shaft. Also, the last thirteen locomotives built by ALCO, issued in 1947, were equipped with feedwater heaters. These 13 locomotives were given the designation Емв. In 1946, at the Yaroslavl locomotive plant, two locomotives were weighed: one was an Еа with bar frames, and the other was an Ем with a cast frame. It was found that the engine Е-2001, Е-2988 and Ем-3892 have common operating weights which were, respectively, 102.8, 99, 6, and 103.5 tonnes, and the adhesion weight was 91.2, 88.7 and 91.5 tonnes.|$|R
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} in the previous paragraph The Victor/Vulcan 2994-6 locomotives were ordered by the Steel Company of Wales (SCOW) for their Abbey, Margam and Port Talbot works in 1950. They had {{a whole range of}} such as 18" [...] X 26" [...] cylinders, together with piston valves, roller-type big-end and side-rod bearings, manganese steel axle-box and horn plate liners, hopper ashpans, self-cleaning smokeboxes, <b>rocking</b> <b>grates</b> and Lambets wet sanding. Steel fireboxes were used as well as [...] "Owens" [...] patent poppet valve and balanced regulator valves. surprisingly the locomotives wasn't fitted with superheating and although the locomotives were powerful they weren't the most powerful as the Peckett OQ Class with 29,527 lbf of tractive effort was the most powerful while the 2994-6 locomotives only had 25,250 lbs of tractive effort. In later life 2994 and 2996 were sold to Austin Motor company and were named 'Victor' and 'Vulcan' [...] They ran until 1972 when the locos were preserved on the West Somerset Railway and currently run at the Stephenson Railway Museum and the Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway. 2995 was sold to NCB at the same time for use at a colliery and was scrapped in 1967.|$|R
50|$|During 1920, {{most of the}} fireboxes on {{the early}} orders of the Class 14C were restayed. The {{reversing}} gear was of the single cylinder type and tended to creep. Hendrie therefore fitted oil cylinders and installed his Hendrie reversing gear, which was manufactured in the Pretoria workshops during 1922. Modifications were also made to the finger bars and <b>rocking</b> <b>grate</b> cylinders of the firebox and to the sanding gear. Approximately 2 lt t of lead were run into the smokebox saddle casting to provide additional weight on the leading bogie.|$|E
50|$|The Class 10 was of an {{extremely}} advanced {{design for the}} day. At 7 ft long, the firebox was somewhat shorter than usual practice, but much wider at 6 ft. It had a rocking firegrate with a drop grate at the front. The <b>rocking</b> <b>grate</b> was operated by a small steam cylinder of 4 in bore and 6 in stroke, arranged under the footplate. This arrangement became standard practice on all new locomotives, except on those equipped with mechanical stokers where it was found preferable to divide the grate into sections which could be shaken separately by hand gear.|$|E
50|$|During 1920, it {{was found}} {{necessary}} to restay most of the fireboxes on the early orders of the Class 14C. Their reversing gear was of the single cylinder type and tended to creep. D.A. Hendrie, {{at the time the}} Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR), therefore fitted oil cylinders and installed his Hendrie reversing gear, which was manufactured in the Pretoria workshops during 1922. Modifications were also made to the finger bars and <b>rocking</b> <b>grate</b> cylinders of the firebox and to the sanding gear. Approximately 2 lt t of lead were run into the smokebox saddle casting to provide additional weight on the leading bogie.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{possible}} applications concerning monitoring of geomorphological evolution such as landslip and soil creep, water flow in soil, imbibition, drying, {{thermal expansion and contraction}} are considered. Monitoring of those processes is very useful {{for safety and}} efficiency, but it is usually very expensive both because of the instrumentation and the personnel required. In this paper we propose a new technique, based of fiber optic sensors, for monitoring deformations in rocks, in particular tufitic <b>rocks.</b> Fiber Bragg <b>Grating</b> (FBG) sensors can be used as optical strain gages to check in real time the deformation on the slope induced by temperature and water content variations. Furthermore it has been verified the measuring capability of the sensor with respect to temperature and imbibition in rocks and marbles for possible applications in cultural heritage where those materials were commonly used...|$|R
50|$|The Class 14C {{proved to}} be good locomotives, even though they {{initially}} suffered from some serious teething troubles.

50|$|The {{pony truck}} of the V2 class was {{replaced}} by Thompson's own design of bogie and they had an extended smokebox. They retained the same boiler as the V2 class although the pressure was increased to 225psi, giving an increased tractive effort of 36390 lbf kN. The firebox was also {{the same as the}} V2 although these were the first LNER locomotives to be fitted with a <b>rocking</b> <b>grate</b> and ashpan. Rather than have all three cylinders driving a single axle Thompson adopted divided drive with the middle cylinder driving the first pair of driving wheels and the outside cylinders the middle pair. Thompson also abandoned the Gresley conjugated valve gear and instead fitted independent sets of Walschaerts valve gear to each cylinder.|$|E
