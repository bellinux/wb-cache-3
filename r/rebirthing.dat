5|$|There {{is also a}} {{considerable}} variety of treatments for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis outlined above, popularly known as attachment therapy. These therapies {{have little or no}} evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, <b>rebirthing,</b> rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of attachment theory. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasise obedience and parental control. These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. An estimated six children have died {{as a consequence of the}} more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.|$|E
25|$|This form of {{treatment}} differs significantly from evidence-based attachment-based therapies, talking psychotherapies such as attachment-based psychotherapy and relational psychoanalysis or {{the form of}} attachment parenting advocated by the pediatrician William Sears. Further, the form of <b>rebirthing</b> sometimes used within attachment therapy differs from the unrelated breathing therapy known as <b>Rebirthing.</b>|$|E

The Talismans create the Holy Grail, allowing Usagi to acquire a second form: Super Sailor Moon. The Death Busters' intentions then change to harvesting Heart Crystals en masse to resurrect the malevolent entity known as Mistress 9. Chibiusa also befriends a sickly girl named Hotaru, unaware that she is the daughter of the Death Busters' leader, Professor Tomoe. Unknown to her, Hotaru is also Sailor Saturn, a Sailor Soldier capable of destroying and <b>rebirthing</b> entire planets. Haruka, Michiru and Setsuna fear that her awakening will result in Earth's destruction and plead for Usagi to kill her.|$|E
25|$|The APSAC Task Force {{describes}} how the conceptual focus of these treatments is the child's individual internal pathology and past caregivers rather than current parent-child relationships or current environment. If the child is well-behaved outside the home this is seen as successful manipulation of outsiders, rather than as evidence of {{a problem in the}} current home or current parent-child relationship. The APSAC Task Force noted that this perspective has its attractions because it relieves the caregivers of responsibility to change aspects of their own behavior and aspirations. Proponents believe that traditional therapies fail to help children with attachment problems because it is impossible to establish a trusting relationship with them. They believe this is because children with attachment problems actively avoid forming genuine relationships. Proponents emphasize the child's resistance to attachment and the need to break it down. In <b>rebirthing</b> and similar approaches, protests of distress from the child are considered to be resistance that must be overcome by more coercion.|$|E
500|$|Treatments of this pseudoscientific {{disorder}} {{are called}} [...] "Attachment therapy". In general, these therapies {{are aimed at}} adopted or fostered children {{with a view to}} creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasize obedience and parental control. There is considerable criticism of this form of treatment and diagnosis as it is largely unvalidated and has developed outside the scientific mainstream. There is little or no evidence base and techniques vary from non-coercive therapeutic work to more extreme forms of physical, confrontational and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, <b>rebirthing,</b> rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. These forms of the therapy may well involve physical restraint, the deliberate provocation of rage and anger in the child by physical and verbal means including deep tissue massage, aversive tickling, enforced eye contact and verbal confrontation, and being pushed to revisit earlier trauma. Critics maintain that these therapies are not within the attachment paradigm, are potentially abusive, and are [...] to attachment theory. The APSAC Taskforce Report of 2006 notes that many of these therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. Children may be described as [...] "RADs", [...] "Radkids" [...] or [...] "Radishes" [...] and dire predictions may be made as to their supposedly violent futures if they are not treated with attachment therapy. The Mayo Clinic, a well known U.S. non-profit medical practice and medical research group, cautions against consulting with mental health providers who promote these types of methods and offer evidence to support their techniques; to date, this evidence base is not published within reputable medical or mental health journals.|$|E

So, in other words, the <b>rebirth</b> is not literal, as stated by Kieman, but rather the <b>rebirth</b> is symbolic of the sentiments and intellectual themes of the Late Renaissance.

2500|$|Candace Elizabeth Newmaker (born Candace Tiara Elmore, November 19, 1989 [...] April 18, 2000) was {{a victim}} of child abuse, killed during a 70-minute {{attachment}} therapy session purported to treat reactive attachment disorder. The treatment used that day included a <b>rebirthing</b> script, during which Candace was suffocated. The story had international coverage.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, proponents {{believed}} that holding induced age regression, enabling {{a child to}} make up for physical affection missed earlier in life. Regression is key to the holding therapy approach. In attachment therapy, breaking down the child's resistance by confrontational techniques is thought to reduce the child to an infantile state, thus making the child receptive to forming attachment by the application of early parenting behaviors such as bottle feeding, cradling, rocking and eye contact. Some, but by no means all, attachment therapists have used <b>rebirthing</b> techniques to aid regression. The roots of the form of <b>rebirthing</b> used within attachment therapy lie in primal therapy (sometimes known as primal scream therapy), another therapy based on beliefs in very early trauma and the transformational nature of age regression. Bowlby explicitly rejected the notion of regression stating [...] "present knowledge of infant and child development requires that a theory of developmental pathways should replace theories that invoke specific phases of development in which it is held a person may become fixated and/or to which he may regress." ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>rebirth</b> {{doctrine}} in Buddhism, {{sometimes referred to}} as reincarnation or metempsychosis, asserts that <b>rebirth</b> does not necessarily take place as another human being, but as an existence in one of the six Gati (realms) called Bhavachakra. The six realms of <b>rebirth</b> include Deva (heavenly), Asura (demigod), Manusya (human), Tiryak (animals), Preta (ghosts), and Naraka (resident of hell). This <b>rebirth,</b> state Buddhism traditions, is determined by karma, with good realms favored by Kushala (good karma), while a <b>rebirth</b> in evil realms is a consequence of Akushala (bad karma). While Nirvana is the ultimate goal of Buddhist teaching, much of traditional Buddhist practice has been centered on gaining merit and merit transfer, whereby one gains <b>rebirth</b> in the good realms and avoids <b>rebirth</b> in the evil realms.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{observers}} {{perceive a}} gap between scientific theory and its application—in particular, the application of unsupported or unsound clinical practices. Critics say {{there has been an}} increase in the number of mental health training programs that do not instill scientific competence. One skeptic asserts that practices, such as [...] "facilitated communication for infantile autism"; memory-recovery techniques including body work; and other therapies, such as <b>rebirthing</b> and reparenting, may be dubious or even dangerous, despite their popularity. In 1984, Allen Neuringer made a similar point regarding the experimental analysis of behavior. Psychologists, sometimes divided along the lines of laboratory vs. clinic, continue to debate these issues.|$|E

2500|$|Foster Cline and {{associates}} at the Attachment Center at Evergreen, Colorado began {{to promote the}} use of the same or similar holding techniques with adopted, maltreated children who were said to have an [...] "attachment disorder". This was replicated elsewhere such as at [...] "The Center" [...] in the Pacific Northwest. A number of other clinics arose in Evergreen, Colorado, set up by those involved in or trained at the Attachment Center at Evergreen (renamed the Institute for Attachment and Development in about 2002). These included one set up by Connell Watkins, formerly an associate of Foster Cline at the Attachment Center and its clinical director. Watkins was one of the therapists convicted in the Candace Newmaker case in 2001 in which a child was asphyxiated during a <b>rebirthing</b> process {{in the course of a}} two-week attachment therapy [...] "intensive".

2500|$|According to the APSAC Task Force, these therapies are {{sufficiently}} prevalent to have prompted position statements or specific prohibitions against using coercion or restraint {{as a treatment}} by mainstream professional societies such as: American Psychological Association (Division on Child Maltreatment), National Association of Social Workers (and its Utah Chapter), American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and American Psychiatric Association. The Association for the Treatment and Training in the Attachment of Children, (ATTACh), an organization for professionals and families associated with attachment therapy, has also issued statements against coercive practices. Two American states, Colorado and North Carolina, have outlawed <b>rebirthing.</b> There have been professional licensure sanctions against some leading proponents and successful criminal prosecutions and imprisonment of therapists and parents using attachment therapy techniques. Despite this, the treatments appear to be continuing among networks of attachment therapists, attachment therapy centers, caseworkers, and adoptive or foster parents. The advocacy group ACT states, [...] "Attachment Therapy is a growing, underground movement for the 'treatment' of children who pose disciplinary problems to their parents or caregivers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Forty {{minutes into}} the session, Jeane asked Candace [...] "Baby, {{do you want to}} be born?" [...] Candace faintly responded [...] "no"; this would {{ultimately}} be her last word. To this, Ponder replied, [...] "Quitter, quitter, quitter, quitter! Quit, quit, quit, quit. She's a quitter!". Jeane Newmaker, who said later she felt rejected by Candace's inability to be reborn, was asked by Watkins to leave the room, in order that Candace would not [...] "pick up on (Jeane's) sorrow". Soon thereafter, Watkins requested the same of McDaniel and Brita St. Clair, leaving only herself and Ponder in the room with Candace. After talking for five minutes, the two unwrapped Candace and found that she was motionless, blue on the fingertips and lips, and not breathing. Upon seeing this, Watkins declared, [...] "Oh there she is, she's sleeping in her vomit." [...] Whereupon the mother, who had been watching on a monitor in another room, rushed into the room, remarked on Candace's color, and began CPR while Watkins called 9-1-1. When paramedics arrived ten minutes later, McDaniel told them that Candace had been left alone for five minutes during a <b>rebirthing</b> session and was not breathing. The paramedics surmised that Candace had been unconscious and possibly not breathing for some time. Paramedics were able to restore the girl's pulse and she was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Denver; she was declared brain-dead the next day, the consequence of asphyxia.|$|E
