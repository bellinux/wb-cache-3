40|$|The {{explosive}} boiling {{that occurs}} when a volatile liquid is suddenly vented to the atmosphere has been investigated experimentally. <b>Refrigerant</b> <b>22</b> is used as the test liquid and is depressurized from an initial state of equilibrium using a bursting foil diaphragm. The competition between the rates of venting and vapor generation can lead to substantial repressurization within the vessel. The influence of vent area, quantity of liquid, initial pressure and pre-nucleation on the explosive boiling characteristics has been studied in a 260 ml Teflon-coated vessel {{as well as in}} a 75 ml glass tube. The amount of repressurization is found to be proportional to the pressure drop which determines the degree of superheat attained by the liquid. The time for repressurization is typically an order of magnitude larger than the time for the pressure drop. The repressurization in both vessels reaches a maximum value at an initial saturation vapor pressure of $ approx$ 2 MPa. The dependence of the repressurization on initial pressure observed experimentally is found to be consistent with the predictions of a semi-empirical correlation based on homogeneous nucleation theory. High-speed photography shows that the mode of boiling is dependent on the initial vapor pressure and the surface condition of the vessel walls. Heterogeneous boiling from the walls dominates in the Teflon-coated steel vessel. For initial vapor pressures less than $ approx$ 1 MPa, an evaporation wave propagates at $ approx$ 0. 15 m/s from the free surface throughout the length of the glass tube. For higher initial vapor pressures the boiling mode in the glass tube becomes predominantly heterogeneous.

The study was carried out on behalf of GEC Research Ltd through the Interdisciplinary Higher Degrees Scheme at Aston University. A computer based mathematical model of the vapour compression cycle was produced as a design aid, to enable the effects of component design changes or variations in operating conditions to be predicted. This model is supported by performance testing of the major components, which revealed that improvements in the compressor isentropic efficiency offer the greatest potential for further increases in cycle COPh. The evaporator was designed from first principles, {{and is based on}} wire-wound heat transfer tubing. Two evaporators, of air side area 10. 27 and 16. 24 m 2, were tested in a temperature and humidity controlled environment, demonstrating that the benefits of the large coil are greater heat pump heat output and lower noise levels. A systematic study of frost growth rates suggested that this problem is most severe at the conditions of saturated air at 0 oC combined with low condenser water temperature.

Most of refrigerants used in vapor Compression system were Chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs) and Hydro Chlorofluorocarbon (HCFCs) which contains chlorine and if any leakage in the system, these gases will go up and reach stratosphere.

40|$|Fluorocarbons {{which are}} less {{damaging}} to atmospheric ozone levels have recently become available on an industrial scale. It {{is necessary to}} assess their solubilities in solvents such as polyols to optimize their uses as blowing agents or refrigerants. The equilibrium vapour pressures at 25 degrees C over the <b>refrigerants</b> R <b>22,</b> R 124, R 142 b and R 134 a in propoxylated polyols, polyamines and polycarboxylates at 19 % and 20 % w(F) /w(S) have been measured. The data have been interpreted using the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter X. This depends quantitatively {{on the number of}} basic ether oxygens in the solvent, and on the relative acidities of the fluorocarbons as well as the propoxylation precursor. The vapour pressures over ternary mixtures have been modelled using a linear combination of binary chi values corrected by a single adjustable constant independent of the solvent type...|$|R
