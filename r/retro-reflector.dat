40|$|Satellite laser ranging system calculates the {{distance}} from ground-based observatories to satellites using the round-trip travel time of laser pulse. The position of <b>retro-reflectors</b> on satellites needs to be corrected which is helpful to improvie the measuring precision of satellite laser ranging. The correction errors of center-of-mass(CoM) are mainly caused by the distribution effects of <b>retro-reflectors</b> on satellites. CoM is related to incident angle, structural alignment of <b>retro-reflectors</b> and ground-based position. Based on the reflecting probability of photons for <b>retro-reflectors</b> {{is proportional to the}} cross sections of <b>retro-reflectors,</b> the cross section area of corner reflectors is fitted and the probabilistic model is established using incident angle as the random variable. The corrections of CoMs of spherical satellite such as LAGEOS- 1 / 2 are calculated and different CoM values are applied for SLR precise orbit determination using long-term full rate observation data with different WRMS results analyzed. At last, for the planar array <b>retro-reflectors,</b> the CoMs of BeiDou navigational satellite such as BeiDou-M 3 are also calculated and analyzed using one month SLR full rate data. The result shows that the calculated CoMs based on probability theory have the comparative precision in SLR precise orbit determination...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the reflectivity of the <b>retro-reflectors</b> in LHD reduced drastically {{in a short period of}} time due to plasma-surface interaction. In the present work, it was tried to find mechanism for the reflectivity reduction by carrying out reflectivity measurements, surface observation and surface chemical analysis. The surface at the central part of the reflectors, which were used for the reflection of the laser, were covered by thick deposition composed of Fe, Cr, Ni and O, because deposition exceeds erosion by sputtering. Due to the inner corner structure like a funnel, impurity atoms were effectively transported toward the center by sputtering and this directional movement resulted in the very rough surface structure, which was the main reason for the reduction of the optical reflectivity. These results suggest effective measures against the reduction of reflectivity of the <b>retro-reflectors</b> in LHD...|$|R
40|$|In near to eye {{displays}} {{based on}} scanning laser projectors, <b>retro-reflectors</b> seem as convenient image relay components since they can ideally be placed at any {{location on the}} scanned beam path. In case of practical retro reflectors though, such as corner cube <b>retro-reflectors</b> (CCRs), the relayed image suffers from loss in quality and resolution due to the positional shift in the retro-reflected rays and the diffraction effects. We perform a wave optics simulation to analyze the image relay performance of a CCR. Our model assumes that the scanned spot of the projector is imaged by the CCR into an array of spots, which superpose and interfere to yield the effective scan spot seen by an eye looking at the CCR. The {{results indicate that the}} CCR results in a significant broadened spot size. Experimental results verify the simulation model in terms of achievable resolution and image quality...|$|R

Two lidar instruments being considered as part of the Eos payload are the Lidar Atmospheric Sounder and Altimeter (LASA) and the Laser Atmospheric Wind Sounder (LAWS). The LASA instrument is separable into two portions: the atmospheric sounder component and the retroranging component. The LASA atmospheric sounder will sample the spatial distribution of several atmospheric parameters. The retroranging component will be used to determine the precise three-dimensional position of specifically placed <b>retro-reflectors</b> and to sense how these <b>retro-reflectors</b> change position over monthly to yearly time periods.

50|$|The optical {{nature of}} the {{technology}} provides communications that are not susceptible to issues related to electromagnetic frequency allocation. The multiple quantum well modulating <b>retro-reflector</b> has the added advantages of being compact, lightweight, and requires very little power.

However, MQW modulators also have relatively small modulation ranges compared to other technologies.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} a {{modulating}} <b>retro-reflector</b> is not new, {{dating back to the}} 1940s. Various demonstrations of such devices have been built over the years, though the demonstration of the first MQW MRR in 1993 was notable in achieving significant data rates. However, MRRs are still not widely used, and most research and development in that area is confined to rather exploratory military applications, as free-space optical communications in general tends to be a rather specialized niche technology.|$|E
5000|$|NASA has {{requested}} that Block III satellites carry laser <b>retro-reflectors.</b> [...] This allows tracking {{the orbits of}} the satellites independent of the radio signals, which allows satellite clock errors to be disentangled from ephemeris errors.

50|$|In {{a typical}} optical {{communications}} arrangement, the MRR with its related electronics {{is mounted on}} a convenient platform and connected to a host computer which has the data {{that are to be}} transferred. A remotely located optical transmitter/receiver system usually consisting of a laser, telescope, and detector provides an optical signal to the modulating <b>retro-reflector.</b> The incident light from the transmitter system is both modulated by the MRR and reflected directly back toward the transmitter (via the retroreflection property). Figure 1 illustrates the concept.|$|E
50|$|A descent camera (DECA) was {{included}} in the payload. Its captured images were to be transmitted after landing. AMELIA, COMARS+, and DECA collected data during the entry, descent, and landing for about six minutes. Much of this data was transmitted while it was descending. Although EDL portion was designed to last literally a few minutes, and the surface observations at most a few days, one instrument, INRRI, was a passive laser <b>retro-reflector</b> that could be used as long as possible, even decades later, for laser range-finding of the lander.|$|E
50|$|Qualities often {{considered}} desirable in MRRs (obviously {{depending on the}} application) include a high switching speed, low power consumption, large area, wide field-of-view, and high optical quality. It should also function at certain wavelengths where appropriate laser sources are available, be radiation-tolerant (for non-terrestrial applications), and be rugged. Mechanical shutters and ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) devices, for example, are too slow, heavy, or are not robust enough for many applications. Some modulating <b>retro-reflector</b> systems are desired to operate at data rates of megabits per second (Mbit/s) and higher and over large temperature ranges characteristic of installation out-of-doors and in space.|$|E
