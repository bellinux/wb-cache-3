40|$|In Mexico, {{the share}} of adults that have a <b>regulated</b> <b>transaction</b> account is low, even when {{compared}} to other countries of similar income levels. Traditionally, this problem has been regarded as a phenomenon of «involuntary exclusion», in which excluded individuals wish to use this service but face a number of barriers, among which those related to costs are the most relevant. Thus, public policies have focused on reducing costs. On the other hand, little {{attention has been paid to}} individuals that seemingly have decided not to use these accounts. Even if they do not face significant barriers to access the accounts, they prefer using non-regulated transactional services, or make and receive payments in cash only and keep cash surpluses at home. In this paper the phenomenon of «self-exclusion» is analyzed. It concludes that cost barriers only partially explain exclusion in the context of transactional bank accounts. Such exclusion also reflects the prevalence of informal economic relationships, which reduces the value proposition of transactional bank accounts to end users...|$|E

40|$|Takeovers {{undertaken}} in Australia are highly <b>regulated</b> <b>transactions.</b> Once shareholders {{in the target}} accept an offer they have a limited opportunity, if any at all, to reconsider or revoke their acceptance {{in the light of}} new circumstances. Arguably, this explains target shareholders reluctance to accept an offer made for their shares under a takeover. The problem of shareholder inertia in takeovers has been identified by bidders, who have sought to induce bid acceptance through the use of innovative mechanisms. The efficacy of the Acceptance Facility mechanism was recently revisited in the Panel decision in Patrick Corporation Ltd’s takeover by Toll Holdings Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{future of}} {{commercial}} arbitration {{has become a}} centerpiece of the domestic congressional agenda. According to one estimate, ten different bills introduced in the 110 th Congress would chip away at the enforceability of pre-dispute arbitration agreements. By far the most significant bill, the Arbitration Fairness Act, would retroactively invalidate arbitration agreements in all employment, consumer, securities and franchise contracts. An especially vague provision in a prior {{version of the bill}} would invalidate agreements involving claims under statutes intended to protect civil rights or designed to <b>regulate</b> <b>transactions</b> between parties of unequal bargaining power.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{existence}} of insider trading abnormal profits in Euronext Lisbon from January 2001 to December 2005. Using the methodology of event studies, our overall results show that, in spite of existing legislation to <b>regulate</b> <b>transactions,</b> insiders are still able to make abnormal profits. Results also show that insider buying is a stronger indicator than insider selling and that the magnitude and duration of abnormal profits depend on both firm and transaction-specific factors. These include industry classification, firm size, firm valuation and relative trading volume.

40|$|Transaction cost theory (TCT) {{had been}} posited, by Oliver Williamson, as a {{theoretically}} rigorous way of explaining {{the institutions that}} are found in capitalist economies, for <b>regulating</b> <b>transactions</b> {{in the face of}} bounded rationality and opportunism (Williamson 1995, 1996). The approach was developed with a particular regard for theoretical stringency, developing a complex array of typologies and predictions from a parsimonious foundation of assumptions. There have been a large number of attempts to test the approach (Baur 1990). Because of convergent results and interpretations, the relevance of Williamson’s explanation of vertical integration has become well established. Vertical integration has been the core business’ of TCT, since its inception...|$|R

40|$|In recent decades, the {{acceleration}} of two international trends-nationalism and economic interdependence-has heightened the ancient problem of extraterritorial prescriptive jurisdiction, or to what extent states may apply their laws outside their borders. Economic interdependence has prompted states to <b>regulate</b> <b>transactions</b> occurring outside their borders, but states with concurrent jurisdiction over the same matters have often resisted these assertions of extraterritorial jurisdiction {{on the grounds of}} territorial sovereignty. European states, for example, have vociferously protested the extraterritorial provisions of the Reagan administration 2 ̆ 7 s pipeline regulations and the recent Cuban embargo legislation, known as the Helms-Burton Act. The existence of such tension creates a temptation to fashion a legal regime that would govern conflicts of jurisdiction between states...|$|R

The ruling by Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen of U.S. District Court Judge, Central District of California, is pending appeal in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Nguyen added: The Court finds that the CRRA explicitly regulates applicable sales of fine art occurring wholly outside California added. Under its clear terms, the CRRA <b>regulates</b> <b>transactions</b> occurring anywhere in the United States, {{so long as the}} seller resides in California.
