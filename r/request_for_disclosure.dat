50|$|Following {{a series}} of Freedom of Information {{requests}} in 2011, to police constabularies throughout England and Wales {{it was revealed that}} the RSPCA has developed local information sharing protocols with a number of constabularies, allowing designated RSPCA workers access to confidential information held on the Police National Computer (PNC). Although RSPCA workers do not have direct access to the PNC, information is shared with them by the various police constabularies which would reveal any convictions, cautions, warnings, reprimands and impending prosecutions. Information regarding motor vehicles can also be accessed. The Association of Chief Police Officers released a statement clarifying that the RSPCA had no direct access to the PNC, and that in common with other prosecuting bodies, it may make a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>disclosure</b> of records.

40|$|THFA) {{for use in}} crop {{production}} Executive Summaryl The following petition is under consideration {{with respect to the}} USDA NOP Final Rule: Petitioned: Addition of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) to § 205. 601, "Synthetic substances allowed for use in organic {{crop production}}. " (Contractor's Note: Federal regulations require that National List petitions include specific information needed for a comprehensive evaluation of a substance. In the case of the THFA petition, certain information deemed Confidential Business Information (CBI) has been withheld from the contractor by the National Organic Program (NOP). In response to the contractor's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>disclosure,</b> NOP staff reviewed the CBI and stated that the restricted information "is not germane to the evaluation of THFA in regard to the seven OFPA criteria. " The contractor has complied with the NOP's directive to proceed with the THFA TAP review. ] Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) is being petitioned for use as a "pesticidal inert ingredient " in organic agriculture. THFA is synthesized from agricultural byproducts, and has an extensive history of use as a highly versatile, high purity solvent. Due to its relatively benign nature {{and the fact that it}} is not oil-based, THFA is generally regarded as a "green " solvent in industrial applications. As mentioned above, evaluation of THFA is made difficult by a lack of specific information regarding its use in agricultural systems. All three reviewers felt that the substance should be considered synthetic, however they were not in agreement on the use of THFA in organic agriculture. Two reviewers recommended that THFA be allowed for use, based on its utility and benign nature. One reviewer dissented, feeling that the missing information was too substantial to allow an effective review...|$|E

40|$|As {{digital rights}} holders become {{increasingly}} proactive in asserting their rights against infringers, Internet service providers ("ISPs") are more frequently becoming embroiled in online copyright infringement disputes.

It also considers the obligations of ISPs to disclose subscriber details to digital rights holders who allege that those subscribers have infringed their digital rights.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a questionnaire survey of therapists in the UK {{who have been}} subject to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>disclosure</b> of client records as part of a legal process. Therapist responses are outlined in terms of the perceived effect of such disclosure on the client, therapist and the therapeutic relationship. Negative effects included the experience of exposure of sensitive client material in an adversarial legal system, of powerful emotional responses by therapists, and a sense of feeling professionally de-skilled in an unfamiliar and often challenging legal environment. Positive effects for the client included the achievement of valued outcomes such as compensation, and, for the therapist, the facilitation of support for the client in this process. These findings are discussed in terms of a contrast between therapist perceptions of consensual and contested disclosure. In the former, therapist and client are in agreement about the restorative value and outcome of disclosure. In contested disclosure, the process is experienced as disrupting therapeutic privacy, undermining professional self-confidence and introducing an unwelcome element of critical re-evaluation of client motives for undertaking therapy...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how the Securities and Exchange Commission balances competing regulatory objectives in its decisions to approve requests to withhold proprietary information from firms' financial reports. The confidential treatment process requires the SEC {{to balance the}} public interest in protecting proprietary information with the public interest in promoting disclosures to investors. I draw upon {{the economic and political}} science literatures on regulatory decision-making to test the strength of these interests on three aspects of the SEC's decisions to grant confidential treatment: the duration of time required to approve the request, the duration of time the SEC agrees to protect proprietary information from disclosure, and whether the firm is successful in securing confidential treatment for all redacted information. I find that the public interest in promoting disclosure and protecting proprietary information influence different aspects of the SEC's decisions to grant regulatory exemptions for confidential treatment. Firms requiring greater monitoring by the SEC receive greater scrutiny and have lower odds of successful redaction. High proprietary costs are associated with significantly longer protection periods but proprietary costs generally are not associated with duration to approval or the success of the application. Finally, I find that the SEC applies greater scrutiny to firms exhibiting objective and salient measures of low financial reporting quality although these firms have higher odds of success. These findings are consistent with the SEC reviewing CTRs {{to reduce the risk of}} legislative oversight. This study contributes to the literature on disclosure regulation by providing evidence as to how securities regulators balance competing interests when reviewing <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>disclosure</b> exemptions. These findings also contribute to the role of political influence on disclosure policy, as the SEC's exemption decisions are consistent with avoiding the threat of legislative oversight. Second, these findings contribute to the literature on the SEC's regulatory decisions by demonstrating that the SEC staff appears to allocate resources and apply scrutiny to applications <b>for</b> <b>disclosure</b> exemptions using aspects of registered firms' financial reporting quality. Third, these findings contribute to the literature on redaction as a disclosure choice by providing evidence suggesting that firms with low financial reporting quality are more likely to redact, and I provide evidence on the success of this disclosure choice. Overall, these findings suggest that the public interest in promoting disclosure, as well as the threat of legislative oversight, influence the SECs decisions when granting regulatory exemptions to protect proprietary information...|$|R

40|$|In pluralistic deliberative settings, {{where people}} come from {{different}} cultural and social backgrounds, sharing personal experiences and narratives {{in the first person}} is often advocated as a preferential means to bridge the informational and motivational gap between members of different social groups. Whatever the epistemic merits of personal storytelling in democratic deliberation may be, the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> transparency and <b>disclosure</b> of people’s private experiences that this practice entails may be objectionable on moral grounds, because it disrespects people as agents who have practical authority over their own lives. Having people disclose their personal stories in public can humiliate them, reify them and abridge their personal liberties. What is worse, these harms are especially likely to be inflicted upon members of marginalised or disadvantaged minorities.

[...] Elkins, who, like Anderson, is an expert witness for the Mau Mau legal action, highlighted the need for caution, and wrote of her involvement with trying to get files out of the foreign office for analysis back at Harvard: [...] "This process has been anything but straightforward. Despite the legal context, the FCO has culled files, requiring multiple <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> full <b>disclosure,</b> and still files have not been forthcoming." [...] Of the April 2012 release, she noted that it [...] "excludes territories such as Palestine and Rhodesia. The Cyprus files exclude the period of the emergency.
