40|$|As {{member states}} {{struggle}} {{to retain the}} investment grades necessary {{to allow them to}} finance their governmental operations at a reasonable cost, credit rating agencies (CRAs) have been blamed for exacerbating a procyclical bias which only makes this task more difficult. How CRAs contribute to the constitution of the politics of limits underpinning the European sovereign debt crisis {{is at the core of}} this article. As a socio-technical device of control, sovereign ratings are an ‘illocutionary' statement about budgetary health, which promotes an artificial fiscal normality. Subsequently, these austere politics of creditworthiness have ‘perlocutionary' effects, which seek to censure political discretion through normalizing risk techniques aligned with the self-systemic, and thereby self-regulating, logic of Anglo-American versions of capitalism. The ensuing antagonistic relationship between the programmatic/expertise and operational/politics dimensions of fiscal governance leaves Europe vulnerable to crisis and the renegotiation of how the ‘political' is established in the economy.

To achieve the goal of an integrated gas market in the EAS region, governments in member economies must work together to implement a plan. Specifically, four recommendations are made to the EAS states: adopt a formal program to promote and nurture the development of gas markets in member states and phased sectoral reforms in relatively mature markets; set targets to gradually harmonise <b>regulatory</b> and <b>technical</b> <b>standards</b> in the gas sector; coordinate better to promote their "gas" causes; and boost cross-border connectivity and trading within the area and eventually achieve regional gas market integration. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimated}} {{prevalence of}} ventilator-dependent individuals in Europe is 6. 6 per 100   000 people. The increasing number {{and costs of}} these complex patients make present health organisations largely insufficient to face their needs. As a consequence, their burden lays mostly over families. The need to reduce healthcare costs and to increase safety has prompted the development of tele-monitoring for home ventilatory assistance. A European Respiratory Society Task Force produced a literature research based statement on commonly accepted clinical criteria for indications, follow-up, equipment, facilities, legal and economic issues of tele-monitoring of these patients. Many remote health monitoring systems are available, ensuring safety, feasibility, effectiveness, sustainability and flexibility to face different patients' needs. The legal problems associated with tele-monitoring are still controversial. National and European Union (EU) governments should develop guidelines and ethical, legal, <b>regulatory,</b> <b>technical,</b> administrative <b>standards</b> for remote medicine. The economic advantages, if any, of this new approach must be compared to a "gold standard" of home care that is very variable among different European countries and within each European country.

40|$|The new European Financial Supervisory Authorities have {{received}} much {{attention in the}} literature, particularly due to their exceptional emergency decision-making powers. By contrast, this article explicitly chooses to focus on these agencies' less explored yet equally crucial role: their (quasi-) rule-making responsibilities. While being less striking at first sight than their emergency counterparts, these rule-making powers are considerable, carry significant consequences, and raise some interesting dilemmas and concerns. This article complements the previous contribution by going at {{a lower level of}} specification and zooming in on a crucial case for studying rule-making by agencies as the Authorities constitute a culmination of agency rule-making powers, as well as agency powers, more broadly. The article will analyse the Authorities' main (quasi-) rule-making powers and the relevant procedures. It will specifically investigate their role with respect to the adoption of <b>regulatory</b> and implementing <b>technical</b> <b>standards,</b> as well as guidelines and recommendations.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the changes to}} the rulemaking process performed by the National Health Authority (ANS) during a decade, {{as an expression of}} the exercise of its health-related regulatory function. Before the implementation of said changes, the initiative for rulemaking was freely taken by the proposing entities. This situation led to an increased risk of mistakes, and the lack of a standardized methodology and an organized structure of the Regulatory Documents (DN) to be approved by the Ministry of Health. As a result, the National Health Authority decided to organize and standardize the process, {{in order to reduce the}} risk of mistakes during such rulemaking process. Based on the revision of the health-related rulemaking performed by the Ministry of Health for the period 2006 - 2015, which was published on the Legal Standards supplement of El Peruano official gazette, the legal standards (supreme decrees, supreme resolutions) and <b>regulatory</b> documents (health-related <b>technical</b> <b>standards,</b> directives, among others) approved by ministerial resolution are included herein. The statistical analysis of the rulemaking allows its classification by subject, document type and year for comparison purposes. The experience shows that 88 health-related <b>technical</b> <b>standards,</b> 64 health-related directives, 151 administrative directives, 89 technical guidelines (including 40 clinical practice guidelines) and 156 technical papers were approved. Besides, the rulemaking process performed by the ANS was more organized and safer, presented less risk of mistakes, and had a scientific technical support that strengthened the exercise of the sectorial stewardshi...|$|R

40|$|Telemedicine is {{a medical}} {{application}} of advanced technology to disease management. This modality may provide benefits also to patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Different devices and systems are used. The legal problems associated with telemedicine are still controversial. Economic advantages for healthcare systems, though potentially high, are still poorly investigated. A European Respiratory Society Task Force has defined indications, follow-up, equipment, facilities, legal and economic issues of tele-monitoring of COPD patients including those undergoing home mechanical ventilation. Key points The costs of care assistance in chronic disease patients are dramatically increasing. Telemedicine may be a very useful application of information and communication technologies in high-quality healthcare services. Many remote health monitoring systems are available, ensuring safety, feasibility, effectiveness, sustainability and flexibility to face different patients’ needs. The legal problems associated with telemedicine are still controversial. National and European Union governments should develop guidelines and ethical, legal, <b>regulatory,</b> <b>technical,</b> administrative <b>standards</b> for remote medicine. The economic advantages, if any, of this new approach must be compared to a “gold standard” of homecare that is very variable among different European countries and within each European country. The efficacy of respiratory disease telemedicine projects is promising (i. e. to tailor therapeutic intervention; to avoid useless hospital and emergency department admissions, and reduce general practitioner and specialist visits; and to involve the patients and their families). Different programmes based on specific and local situations, and on specific diseases and levels of severity {{with a high level of}} flexibility should be utilised. A European Respiratory Society Task Force produced a statement on commonly accepted clinical criteria for indications, follow-up, equipment, facilities, legal and economic issues also of telemonitoring of ventilator-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Much more research is needed before considering telemonitoring a real improvement in the management of these patients.
