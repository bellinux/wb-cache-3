25|$|For much of {{the history}} of bowling, bowling balls were made using a three-piece {{construction}} method. Starting in the mid-1990s, however, most manufacturers switched to a two-piece method. In response to these innovative ball designs, the American Bowling Congress placed further restrictions on the technical characteristics of the ball such as the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> and hooking potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface of}} the ball is {{required}} to include markings to indicate the manufacturer's brand name, {{the name of the}} ball, the center of gravity (before drilling), the orientation of the core (the Pin), and the axes of the high and/or low <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> (as applicable).

As of April 1, 2009, The USBC now regulates the chemical surface roughness of all bowling balls manufactured for certified ten-pin bowling. This specification is a direct result from the ball motion study, as the surface roughness of the coverstock of a bowling ball was the number one variable (out of 18) that affected the strength (how much a ball hooks) of a bowling ball. The <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> specification has also been tightened and went into effect in 2010.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{arrangement of}} cholesteryl esters in human plasma low density lipoproteins (LDL) {{has been studied}} by selective deuteration and neutron small-angle scattering. LDL were labeled by in vitro exchange with two different kinds of deuterated cholesteryl esters, one labeled in the fatty acyl chain (cholesteryl myristate-d 27) {{and the other in}} the branched side chain of cholesterol (cholesteryl- 25, 26, 27 -d 7 oleate). Neutron scattering data from deuterated and protonated LDL were compared to identify the locations of the fatty acyl and cholesterol side chain moieties. Below the thermotropic transition, <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> <b>of</b> 60 A and 70 A were obtained for these two domains, respectively, indicating that the cholesteryl nuclei are situated more distantly from the center than the fatty acyl chains.

The data show that, in solution, the free proteins have extended domain structures, and the complex is formed by a compact side-by-side alignment of the two proteins along their long axes.
