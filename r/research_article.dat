40|$|Conflation of {{academic}} copyright issues {{with respect to}} books (whether text books, research monographs or popularisations) and <b>research</b> <b>articles,</b> is rife in the academic publishing industry. A charitable interpretation {{is that this is}} because to publishers they are all effectively the same: a product produced for commercial benefit. An uncharitable interpretation {{is that this is a}} classic Fear Uncertainty and Doubt approach, in an attempt to delay the inevitable move to Open Access (OA) to <b>research</b> <b>articles.</b> To authors, however, <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> and books are generally very different things. <b>Research</b> <b>articles</b> are produced without the expectation of direct financial return, whereas books generally include some consideration of financial return. Taylor’s “Copyright and research: an academic publisher’s perspective” (SCRIPT-ed 4 : 2) falls wholesale into this mental trap and in particular his lauding of the position paper of the Association of American Professional and Scholarly Publishers, shows a lack of understanding of the continuing huge loss to scholarship of a lack of OA to <b>research</b> <b>articles.</b> It should be regarded as a categorical imperative for scholars to embrace OA to <b>research</b> <b>articles...</b>|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to examine qualitatively and categorize the scientific studies of the two journals in Turkey. It also aims to contribute the related literature in the area. Material-MethodAcademic journals of medical emergencies published in Turkey between January 1, 2003 and December 20, 2014 were investigated in detail. All the works in journals were categorized briefly as <b>research</b> <b>articles,</b> case presentations, review articles, and other works. Moreover, <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> were investigated as observational and experimental, and discussed according to the including topics. Results 943 scientific works in 86 issues were fully investigated. The total number was found to be 472 for <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> (50. 1 %), 242 for case presentations (25. 7 %), 108 for review articles (11. 5 %), and finally it was 12. 8 % for other works. <b>Research</b> <b>articles</b> included 450 observational (95. 3 %) and 22 experimental studies (4. 7 %). The key topics covered in <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> were the management and training of medical emergencies, trauma 96 (20. 3 %), toxicology 50 (10. 6 %), and gastrointestinal tract 36 (7. 6 %). ConclusionDespite its relatively short history, medical emergencies have improved progressively in Turkey. The number of domestic <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> has demonstrated an increase over the years. However, extra efforts are needed in order to improve the quality of articles.

2500|$|The {{clinical}} {{literature of}} Freund, Blanchard, and others has consistently divided male-to-female transsexuals into two distinct groups - [...] "homosexual transsexuals," [...] {{people who are}} sexually attracted to (ideally heterosexual) men and supposedly desire a normative female body to attract them, and [...] "heterosexual fetishistic transvestites" [...] in which the transsexual purportedly finds {{the idea of having}} a normative female body sexually arousing but desires a heterosexual female partner. [...] Kurt Freund first distinguished between these two proposed types in a 1982 <b>research</b> <b>article,</b> theorizing that the [...] "homosexual" [...] transsexuals were qualitatively different from the so-called [...] "heterosexual males" [...] with gender dysphoria. Sexologist Ray Blanchard coined the term [...] "autogynephilia" [...] to describe this latter category of people.

2500|$|John Gofman {{used his}} own, non-peer {{reviewed}} low-level radiation health model to predict 333 excess cancer or leukemia deaths from the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. A peer-reviewed <b>research</b> <b>article</b> by Dr. Steven Wing {{found a significant}} increase in cancers from 1979–1985 among people who lived within ten miles of TMI; in 2009 Dr. Wing stated that radiation releases during the accident were probably [...] "thousands of times greater" [...] than the NRC's estimates. A retrospective study of Pennsylvania Cancer Registry found an increased incidence of thyroid cancer in counties south of TMI and in high-risk age groups but did not draw a causal link with these incidences and to the accident. The Talbott lab at the University of Pittsburgh reported finding only a few, small, mostly statistically non-significant, increased cancer risks within the TMI population, such as a non-significant excess leukemia among males being observed. The ongoing TMI epidemiological research has been accompanied by a discussion of problems in dose estimates {{due to a lack of}} accurate data, as well as illness classifications.|$|E
2500|$|At {{least four}} veined octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) {{individuals}} were witnessed retrieving coconut shells, manipulating them, stacking them, transporting them some distance (up to 20 metres), and then reassembling {{them to use}} as a shelter. The octopuses use coconut shells discarded by humans which have eventually settled in the ocean. They probe their arms down to loosen the mud, then rotate the shells out. After turning the shells so the open side faces upwards, the octopuses blow jets of mud out of the bowl before extending their arms around the shell—or if they have two halves, stacking them first, one inside the other. They then stiffen their legs and move away in a manner which has been called [...] "stilt-walking". The octopuses eventually use the shells as a protective shelter in areas where little other shelter exists. If they just have one half, they simply turn it over and hide underneath. But if they are lucky enough to have retrieved two halves, they assemble them back into the original closed coconut form and sneak inside. This behaviour [...] The authors of the <b>research</b> <b>article</b> claimed this behaviour falls under the definition of tool use because the shells are carried for later use. However, this argument remains contested by a number of other biologists who state that the shells actually provide continuous protection from abundant bottom-dwelling predators in their home range.|$|E
