5|$|Le Carrefour de l'Arbre (or Pavé de Luchin) is {{the last}} section of pavé of the hardest level of difficulty, five stars. The {{crossroads}} (carrefour) is on open land between Gruson and Camphin-en-Pévèle. The route departs westward from Camphin-en-Pévèle along the <b>rue</b> <b>de</b> Cysoing towards Camphin de l'Arbre. The first half {{is a series of}} corners, then along irregular pavé towards Luchin. The second half finishes at the Café de l'Arbre restaurant and has more even pavé. This 2.1km sector has often proved decisive due to its proximity to Roubaix (15km) and cumulative difficulty.|$|E

5|$|The novel's {{representations}} of social stratification {{are specific to}} Paris, perhaps the most densely populated city in Europe at the time. Traveling only a few blocks– as Rastignac does continually– takes the reader into vastly different worlds, distinguished by their architecture and reflecting the class of their inhabitants. Paris in the post-Napoleonic era was split into distinct neighborhoods. Three of these are featured prominently in Le Père Goriot: the aristocratic area around the Boulevard Saint-Germain, the newly upscale quarter of the <b>rue</b> <b>de</b> la Chaussée-d'Antin, and the run-down area on the eastern slope of the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève.|$|E

Lafayette continued to work on lowering trade barriers in France to American goods, and on assisting Franklin and his successor as envoy, Jefferson, in seeking treaties of amity and commerce with European nations. He also sought to eliminate the injustices that Protestants in France had endured since the revocation of the Edict of Nantes a century before.|$|E

5|$|Bezen Kadoudal {{was placed}} under the {{supervision}} of Sicherheitsdienst Obersturmbannführer Hartmut Pulmer, and under the military command of Hauptscharführer Hans Grimm, its headquarters were located at 7 <b>Rue</b> <b>de</b> Vincennes, Rennes. Its initial 33 members were recruited from a variety of Breton nationalist organizations, some of them had already served in collaborationist militias. Terms of enlistment specified that it will only engage French opponents within the borders of Brittany. On 15 December, Bezen Kadoudal was renamed into Bezen Perrot (Perrot Unit), in honor of the recently assassinated Breton nationalist Jean-Marie Perrot, German documents record it under the name Bretonische Waffenverband der SS. At the top of its strength the unit numbered 80 members the pseudonyms of 65 of whom are recorded. Pseudonyms were used {{in order to protect the}} members' identities.

5|$|Fauré {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1909, after his {{father-in-law}} and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Société Musicale Indépendante. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the <b>rue</b> <b>de</b> Madrid. During this time, Fauré developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out of tune to him.|$|E
5|$|The {{riverside}} façade {{is formed}} by the main residential bulk and the library wing on the west side, which offers a contrast in shape and design, notably through its single, very large window. The {{main part of the}} façade is symmetrically arranged around an avant-corps of four columns with Corinthian capitals. The avant-corps is crowned with a voluminous triangular pediment, again adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan, while the library wing is crowned with a semicircular pediment. That pediment was originally surmounted by two copper statues of angels, now lost. The library wing {{was not part of the}} original 1727 plan but was conceived in 1733, after the cardinal bought up and demolished a row of houses on the current <b>rue</b> <b>de</b> Rohan. The architect, Robert de Cotte, was thus able to distribute the interior spaces of the residential bulk on an even grander and also more practical plan, notably putting the main staircase to the left (east) of the apartment wing instead of the centre.|$|E

They found places living among their co-religionists already established in the Marais. By 1900, about 6,000 had arrived from Rumania, Russia and Austria-Hungary; 18,000 more arrived in the years preceding the First World War.
