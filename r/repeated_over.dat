5|$|Lacombe and Laughlin—along with a {{group of}} United Nations experts—continue to {{investigate}} increasing UFO activity and strange, related occurrences. Witnesses in Dharamshala, India report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a major scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space, but are mystified by the response: a seemingly meaningless series of numbers (104 44 30 40 36 10) <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> and over until Laughlin, with his background in cartography, recognizes it as a set of geographical coordinates, which point to Devils Tower near Moorcroft, Wyoming. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, all the while preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.|$|E
5|$|The {{lopsided}} victory allowed Texas to play several less-experienced players. Back-up quarterback Matt Nordgren {{entered the}} game in the thirdquarter, replacing Vince Young. Third-string quarterback Matt McCoy replaced Nordgren just past the midpoint of the fourthquarter. Since Colt McCoy was listed third on the UT depth chart, television broadcasters referred to Matt McCoy (no relation) as Colt McCoy, a mistake they <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> the season. The Longhorns did not play Colt in the 2005season, choosing to redshirt him instead. After viewing this game as part of a recruiting visit to UT, Jevan Snead – ranked {{as one of the top}} high school quarterbacks in the nation, elected to switch his commitment from University of Florida to Texas.|$|E

5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (sheed). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive oil in large copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used to stir the liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.|$|E

25|$|John Hanson's grandfather, {{also named}} John, came to Charles County, Maryland, as an indentured servant around 1661. In 1876, a writer named George Hanson placed John Hanson {{in his family}} tree of Swedish-Americans descended from four Swedish {{brothers}} who emigrated to New Sweden in 1642. This story was often <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> the next century, but scholarly research in the late 20th century showed that John Hanson {{was not related to}} those Swedish-American Hansons.|$|E
25|$|The Dogon are {{strongly}} oriented toward harmony, which {{is reflected in}} many of their rituals.

25|$|The {{simulation}} can {{be repeated}} {{several times to}} simulate multiple rounds of the game. The player picks {{one of the three}} cards, then, looking at the remaining two cards the 'host' discards a goat card. If the card remaining in the host's hand is the car card, this is recorded as a switching win; if the host is holding a goat card, the round is recorded as a staying win. As this experiment is <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> several rounds, the observed win rate for each strategy is likely to approximate its theoretical win probability.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Tigers had {{the best}} record in {{baseball}} in mid-July, but lost a few players to injuries and started to play poorly in the second half and fade from contention.

The Tigers gave up their division lead to the Cleveland Indians in early September and were officially eliminated from playoff competition on September 26, 2007, when the New York Yankees clinched a wild card berth.

25|$|The {{origins of}} {{spinning}} fibre to make string or yarn are lost in time, but archaeological {{evidence in the}} form of representation of string skirts has been dated to the Upper Paleolithic era, some 20,000 years ago. In the most primitive type of spinning, tufts of animal hair or plant fibre are rolled down the thigh with the hand, and additional tufts are added as needed until the desired length of spun fibre is achieved. Later, the fibre is fastened to a stone which is twirled round until the yarn is sufficiently twisted, whereupon it is wound upon the stone and the process <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> and over.|$|E

500|$|In {{what was}} a {{departure}} from convention, the Western Chalukyan figure sculptures of gods and goddesses bore stiff forms and were <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> and over in the many temples.

[...] Barring occasional exaggerations in pose, each principal deity had its own pose depending on the incarnation or form depicted.
