2500|$|In {{plants and}} microbes, {{changes in the}} lipid {{composition}} of cell membranes {{have been linked to}} cold tolerance. The enhanced <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> treatment appears to be caused by an increased amount of fatty acid desaturases produced under cold stress transforming saturated into unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane. This effect can be reproduced artificially in genetically engineered plants. The changes in membrane lipid composition lead to a higher membrane fluidity, thus keeping the membrane from [...] "freezing" [...] at low temperatures. This [...] "lipid hypothesis of cold tolerance" [...] is less well supported in animals. In fruit flies, cold acclimation does not coincide with a reduced amount of saturated fatty acids, and recent genetic studies on a nematode indicate that the mechanisms involved in cold adaptation in animals may be different from those in plants and microbes.|$|E

In a letter from September 10, 1942, Dr. Sigmund Rascher describes an experiment on intense cooling performed in Dachau where people were dressed in fighter Pilot uniforms and submerged in freezing water. Doctor Rascher had some of the victims completely underwater and other onlys submerged up to the head. Approximately 100 people are reported to have {{died as a result of}} these experiments.|$|E

40|$|Intraspecific Drosophila {{studies suggest}} that <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> heal and <b>cold</b> {{stresses}} are largely independent and that correlations across life cycle stages are low whereas comparisons of Drosophila species indicate correlations between heat and cold resistance {{as well as between}} resistance levels in different life cycle stages. These inconsistent results may reflect differences in associations among traits at the interspecific and intraspecific levels or interspecific correlations arising because of correlated selection pressures. These alternatives were tested using Drosophila serrata, D. birchii and hybrids derived from these species. Variation among hybrid lines and families was used to test associations at the interspecific level while intraspecific variation was examined using isofemale lines of D. serrata. There was a significant association between adult heat knockdown time at 38 degreesC and adult cold resistance in one set of hybrid lines. An association between female knockdown <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> heat and larval heat resistance was also evident in one set of hybrids. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> heat anti <b>cold</b> at the larval stage were not correlated at either the intraspecific or interspecific levels. At the intraspecific level, lan al heat resistance and two measures of adult heat resistance were uncorrelated. Moreover, adult and larval cold resistance measures were not correlated at either the intraspecific or interspecific levels. These results suggest that there are no associations between <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> heat and <b>cold</b> extremes and that extreme temperature resistance is largely independent across life cycle stages at both the intraspecific and interspecific levels. Species associations may therefore arise from correlated selection pressures rather than trait correlations. (C) 2000 The Linnean Society of London...|$|R
