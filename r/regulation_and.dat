30|$|It is of {{fundamental}} importance to refine and update relevant explosion prevention <b>regulations,</b> <b>and</b> strictly enforce work safety standards, {{in order to}} reduce industrial accidents and causalities. At present, China has about 300 state <b>regulations</b> <b>and</b> around 600 industrial standards concerning explosion hazards. 1 But many of these <b>regulations</b> <b>and</b> standards are outdated and lack proper technical and systemic guidance; some of them cannot be applied in practice to solving real problems. Moreover, some standards are not consistent with international standards, which undermines their effects and functions in guiding industrial practices. Many regulatory departments have overlapping mandates. Therefore, regulatory authorities are advised to review the existing explosion control <b>regulations</b> <b>and</b> standards, identify those in need of revision, and then enact <b>and</b> revise <b>regulations</b> <b>and</b> standards in accordance with practical needs. Authorities also should raise China’s industrial standards to an international level and implement them in various operational and management activities.|$|R

5|$|As of November 2014, 28 {{states have}} enacted medical {{marijuana}} laws, removed jail time {{for possession of}} small amounts of marijuana, and/or have legalized the possession, distribution, and sale of marijuana outright.

Although outright legalization for non-medical use of marijuana has only occurred in four states in the Union, in view of the movements in many states, it is possible that those states will not be alone for long.|$|E
