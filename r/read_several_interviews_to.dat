40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of analyzing a legacy PL/ 1 ecosystem that has grown for 40 years to support the business needs of a large banking company. In order to support the stakeholders in analyzing it we developed St 1 -PL/ 1 — a tool that parses the code for association data and computes structural metrics which it then visualizes using top-down interactive exploration. Before building the tool and after demonstrating it to stakeholders we conducted <b>several</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>to</b> learn about legacy ecosystem analysis requirements. We briefly introduce the tool and then present results of analysing the case study. We show that although the vision for the future is to have an ecosystem architecture in which systems are as decoupled as possible {{the current state of the}} ecosystem is still removed from this. We also present some of the lessons learned during our experience discussions with stakeholders which include their interests in automatically assessing the quality of the legacy code. I...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the efficiency of aid in Masaka, Uganda which is about 140 km from the capital city Kampala. It uses the results of 300 surveys and <b>several</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>to</b> gather data, and a causal methodology to define results. Much of the methodology is based on theories from William Easterly, Andrew Mwenda, Dambisa Moyo, Jeffrey Sachs, and Amartya Sen. It has been concluded that there are several problems in the Masaka area. One is Uganda's federal government, which is inefficient and unaccountable. There is also lack of easily accessible health care for rural citizens, and a lack of local development due to poor governance. Conversely, the residents of Masaka are quite developed in terms of employment and education, and have rated themselves as quite free and satisfied with life. There is also a quite adequate level of gender equality, especially in terms of education.

The SVR responded to the book's release by calling it [...] "self-publicity based on treachery." [...] The book's release in Canada was delayed by the publisher because of legal considerations, namely Tretyakov's accusation that former Progressive Conservative MP Alex Kindy was recruited by an SVR officer at the Russian embassy in Ottawa and paid several times between 1992 and 1993.

Contraints à la mobilité par des expulsions à répétition, la sédentarité gouverne néanmoins leur mode de vie. Ce phénomène s’est accentué avec les tentes qui contribuent à la visibilité des SDF aux yeux de la société. Par la restauration de leur visibilité et donc de leur spatialité, les SDF s’échappent un moment de ce nulle part dans lequel il est si tentant de les exiler.
