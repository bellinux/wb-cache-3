5000|$|When {{a person}} {{accused of a}} crime is arrested, his {{statement}} is recorded and information such as the name, <b>residence</b> <b>address,</b> birthplace, charges filed are noted. The police officer may also check back the criminal record if any in the police station and ask for fingerprints to file a case against the accused. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (First Schedule), offences have been classified as [...] "bailable" [...] and [...] "non-bailable" [...] offences. In the case of bailable offences, if the accused produces proper surety, and fulfills other conditions, it is binding upon the Investigating officer to grant bail. However, {{in case of a}} non-bailable offence, the police cannot grant bail; it can only be granted by a Judicial Magistrate/Judge. The Investigating Officer must produce the accused before the Judicial Magistrate / Judge concerned within 24 hours of his arrest. At that time, the accused has a right to apply for bail. Depending upon the facts of the case, the judge decides whether bail should be granted. If bail is granted the accused must deposit money with the court. Generally, for lesser crimes, a standard amount is asked to be deposited for awarding the bail.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of an academic support program on at-risk freshmen students living in residence. The study sought to determine if academic averages and student persistence at university was impacted by an intervention program. The locally developed program at Memorial University's <b>residence</b> <b>addressed</b> topics including study skills, test anxiety and time management. The effects of several demographic factors (such as gender, origin of students, and academic entrance average) were also assessed. Data collected included: academic entrance average, students' year of study, end-of-semester academic average, gender, place of origin (urban or rural) of students, continuance at university the next fall semester, {{and use of the}} "forgiveness clause" (a university regulation allowing students to return to university once after failing out). Results indicated that attending or providing only one type of intervention program to students, as was done for this research, is not an effective means in improving retention or academic averages. Data collected on demographic factors was largely not significant. Recommendations for future research include using multiple or alternative interventions, identifying other factors that may affect students, using a larger sample, collecting information over a longer time period, and providing more focused and personalized academic supports...|$|R
50|$|According to Polish law, the {{registration}} plate {{is tied to}} the vehicle, not the owner. There is no possibility for the owner to keep the licence number for use on a different car, even if it's a custom number. The licence plates are issued by the powiat (county) of the vehicle owner's registered address of residence, {{in the case of a}} natural person. If it is owned by a legal person, the place of registration is determined by the address of its seat. Vehicles leased under operating leases and many de facto finance leases will be registered at the seat of the lessor. When a vehicle changes hands, the new owner must apply for new vehicle registration document bearing his or her name and registered address. The new owner may obtain a new licence plate although it is not necessary when new owner's <b>residence</b> <b>address</b> lies in the same area as the previous owner's. In such a situation the licence plates are usually carried over to the new owner, because the change carries an additional cost. Upon purchasing a vehicle from another person, if the vehicle has an EU plate, the new owner must replace it with a license for their address and area, and give the EU plate to their powiat plate mint to free up numbers in the future. If the car has a pre- May 1, 2006 plate, the owner is free to do whatever they wish with it, as long as it's legal with the Polish law. The plaque cannot be replaced if destroyed. The change of the whole set is required.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Asthma is a {{multifactorial disease}} {{and a serious}} public health problem. Environmental factors and poverty are the main {{determinants}} of this disease. Objective: To describe the spatial and temporal distribution of asthma-related hospitalizations and identify the areas with the highest prevalence of and vulnerability to severe asthma in a major Brazilian city. Methods: An ecological study of hospitalizations for asthma from 2002 to 2012, {{in children and adolescents}} under 15 years of age, living in Belo Horizonte, Southeast Brazil. All events were geocoded by <b>residence</b> <b>address</b> using Hospital Information System data. The socioeconomic vulnerability of <b>residence</b> <b>address</b> was ranked using the Health Vulnerability Index. Raster surfaces were generated and time-series plots were constructed to determine spatial and time trends in the frequency of asthma-related hospitalizations, respectively. Results: Asthma-related hospitalization rates were highest in children aged 0 – 4 years and in boys. There was a decreasing trend in the number of asthma-related hospitalizations across the study period. Approximately 48 % of all hospitalizations were children living in health vulnerable areas. Seasonal trends showed a hospitalization peak in March, April, and May, coinciding with the post-rainy period. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that social and environmental factors may be determinants of disparities in severe asthma...|$|E
