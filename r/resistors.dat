5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in <b>resistors</b> to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The <b>resistors</b> were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium dioxide {{with lead}} and bismuth ruthenates {{are used in}} thick-film chip <b>resistors.</b> These two {{electronic}} applications account for 50% of the ruthenium consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and <b>resistors</b> which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with <b>resistors</b> at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the biasing <b>resistor</b> R1,Ruan Lourens strongly recommends a series <b>resistor</b> Rs between {{the output of the}} inverter and the crystal.The series <b>resistor</b> Rs reduces the chance of overtone oscillation and can improve start-up time. This second <b>resistor</b> Rs isolates the inverter from the crystal network. This would also add additional phase shift to C1. Pierce oscillators above 4 MHz should use a small capacitor rather than a <b>resistor</b> for Rs.|$|R

5000|$|If {{the voltage}} between the DC source {{and the first}} <b>resistor</b> (67 ohms) is measured, the voltage {{potential}} at the first <b>resistor</b> will be slightly less than nine volts. The current passes through the conductor (wire) from the DC source to the first resistor; as this occurs, some of the supplied energy is [...] "lost" [...] (unavailable to the load), due to {{the resistance of the}} conductor. Voltage drop exists in both the supply and return wires of a circuit. If the voltage across each <b>resistor</b> is measured, the measurement will be a significant number. That represents the energy used by the <b>resistor.</b> The larger the <b>resistor,</b> the more energy used by that <b>resistor,</b> and the bigger the voltage drop across that <b>resistor.</b>|$|R
5|$|The host {{includes}} 15kΩ pull-down <b>resistors</b> on each data line. When no {{device is}} connected, this pulls both data lines low into the so-called single-ended zero state (SE0 in the USB documentation), and indicates a reset or disconnected connection.|$|E
5|$|The {{components}} in an electric circuit {{can take many}} forms, which can include elements such as <b>resistors,</b> capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components {{are those that are}} termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrostatic}} design does {{away with}} two major weaknesses of boxed speakers: enclosure colourations and signal degradation {{due to the}} crossover. The crossover in the ESL consists merely of <b>resistors</b> which work with the inherent capacitance of the speaker elements to obtain a first-order response. Because it is bipolar, {{both sides of the}} elements are not enclosed, but radiate directly into the air. Thus, colourations due to crossover components and box-induced reflections are minimised.|$|E

5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} <b>resistors.</b> Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to design linear analogue mechanical filters using mechanical components which filter mechanical vibrations or acoustic waves. While there are few applications for such devices in mechanics per se, {{they can be used}} in electronics with the addition of transducers to convert to and from the electrical domain. Indeed, some of the earliest ideas for filters were acoustic resonators because the electronics technology was poorly understood at the time. In principle, the design of such filters can be achieved entirely in terms of the electronic counterparts of mechanical quantities, with kinetic energy, potential energy and heat energy corresponding to the energy in inductors, capacitors and <b>resistors</b> respectively.|$|E
5|$|Passive linear {{electronic}} analogue {{filters are}} those filters {{which can be}} described with linear differential equations (linear); they are composed of capacitors, inductors and, sometimes, <b>resistors</b> (passive) and are designed to operate on continuously varying (analogue) signals. There are many linear filters which are not analogue in implementation (digital filter), {{and there are many}} electronic filters which may not have a passive topology both of which may have the same transfer function of the filters described in this article. Analogue filters are most often used in wave filtering applications, that is, where it is required to pass particular frequency components and to reject others from analogue (continuous-time) signals.|$|E

50|$|The 1700 and 1750 had a <b>resistor</b> at {{position}} R4 that, according to Commodore engineer Fred Bowen, compensated for subtle {{differences in the}} expansion port on the C64 and C128. The 1764 lacked that <b>resistor.</b> Bowen and other CBM engineers recommended against using a 1764 with a C128 unless the <b>resistor</b> was added, or a 1700/1750 with a C64 unless the <b>resistor</b> was removed.|$|R
5|$|Ruthenium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ru and atomic number 44. It {{is a rare}} transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table. Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is inert to most other chemicals. The Baltic German scientist Karl Ernst Claus discovered the element in 1844 and named it after his homeland, Ruthenia. Ruthenium is usually found as a minor component of platinum ores; the annual production is about 20 tonnes. Most ruthenium produced is used in wear-resistant electrical contacts and thick-film <b>resistors.</b> A minor application for ruthenium is in platinum alloys and as a chemistry catalyst.|$|E
25|$|Thin film <b>resistors</b> {{are usually}} far more {{expensive}} than thick film <b>resistors.</b> For example, SMD thin film <b>resistors,</b> with 0.5% tolerances, and with 25 ppm/K temperature coefficients, when bought in full size reel quantities, are about twice the cost of 1%, 250 ppm/K thick film <b>resistors.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thick film <b>resistors</b> {{became popular}} during the 1970s, and most SMD (surface mount device) <b>resistors</b> today are of this type. The {{resistive}} element of thick films is 1000 times thicker than thin films, but the principal difference {{is how the}} film {{is applied to the}} cylinder (axial <b>resistors)</b> or the surface (SMD <b>resistors).</b>|$|E
