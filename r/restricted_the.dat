40|$|AbstractIn {{a series}} of papers, we have {{classified}} the complexity of list homomorphism problems. Here, we investigate <b>the</b> effect of <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> degrees of the input graphs. It {{turns out that the}} complexity does not change (except when the degree bound is two). We obtain similar results on <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> size of the lists. We contrast these results with facts about variants of the list homomorphism problem, where <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> degrees can have an important effect on the complexity...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{compensatory}} sweating after lowering or <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> {{level of}} sympathectomy. METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted of all randomized controlled trials published in English that compared compensatory sweating after lowering or <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> level of sympathectomy. The Cochrane collaboration tool {{was used to}} assess the risk of bias, and the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio method was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 11 randomized controlled trials were included, including a total of 1079 patients. Five of the randomized controlled trials studied <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> level of sympathectomy, and the remaining six studied lowering the level of sympathectomy. CONCLUSIONS: The compiled randomized controlled trial results published so far in the literature do not support the claims that lowering or <b>restricting</b> <b>the</b> level of sympathetic ablation results in less compensatory sweating...|$|R

This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender 'raves' on all locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and <b>restricted</b> <b>the</b> driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised step ladders and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.|$|E

Bruce states in his autobiography that further investigation revealed that, while his earlier appearance for England B in a friendly match was not an issue, his appearances for the England Youth team in a UEFA-sanctioned tournament prohibited him from playing for the senior team of another country. He has subsequently claimed that he chose not to play for Ireland as it would have caused problems for his club at a time when UEFA <b>restricted</b> <b>the</b> number of foreign players that a club could have in their squad in its competitions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Andriamasinavalona's reign, the {{highlands}} around Imerina were wracked with violent conflict among minor princedoms centered around fortified hill towns. Andriamasinavalona successfully united {{a number of these}} principalities in the territory bordering his own, thereby expanding the boundaries of Imerina to include Fanongoavana to the west, Rangaina to the north, Ombifotsy to the east and Sahasarotra to the south. As he brought each territory under his control, he <b>restricted</b> <b>the</b> autonomy of its original rulers and imposed strict submission to his own authority. His diplomatic and political conquests enabled Andriamasinavalona to extend his kingdom to its fullest historical extent, making him the first Merina sovereign to rule over the entire province of Imerina.|$|E
5|$|Before {{completion}} of the tunnel, in 2009, nearly 16,000 vehicles travelled to and from PortMiami through downtown streets each weekday. Truck traffic made up 28% (or 4,480) of this number (Source: 2009 PB Americas Traffic Study). In 2010 {{it was estimated that}} around 19,000 vehicles traveled to the port daily but that only 16% were trucks. Existing truck and bus routes <b>restricted</b> <b>the</b> port's ability to grow, drive up costs for port users and presenting safety hazards. They were also thought to congest and limit redevelopment of the northern portion of Miami's Central Business District.|$|E
