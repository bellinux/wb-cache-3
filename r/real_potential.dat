25|$|This was {{a gateway}} to many foreign investors to get entry into the Indian Telecom Markets. After March 2000, the {{government}} became more liberal in making policies and issuing licences to private operators. The government further reduced licence fees for cellular service providers and increased the allowable stake to 74% for foreign companies. Because of all these factors, the service fees finally reduced and the call costs were cut greatly enabling every common middle-class family in India to afford a cell phone. Nearly 32 million handsets were sold in India. The data reveals the <b>real</b> <b>potential</b> for growth of the Indian mobile market. Many private operators, such as Reliance Communications, Jio, Tata Indicom, Vodafone, Loop Mobile, Airtel, Idea etc., successfully entered the high potential Indian telecom market.|$|E

Mustafa Kemal's vision regarding early Turkish economic policy was apparent during the İzmir Economic Congress of 1923 which was established before the signing of the Lausanne Treaty. The initial choices of Mustafa Kemal's {{economic policies}} reflected the realities of his period.

The Home Guard's role was to limit the area of exploitation of any enemy invasion through the blocking of roads, demolitions, improvisation, and any other means of checking the invader. With the drain on skilled military instructors for the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force, Young had to draw on the expertise of veteran officers and NCOs from World War I. He held this role until 1944 when the threat to New Zealand had sufficiently reduced to allow demobilisation of the Home Guard.|$|E

The report claimed that [...] "agricultural biotechnology has <b>real</b> <b>potential</b> as a new tool in the war on hunger". In response to the report, more than 650 organisations from around the world signed an open letter in which they said [...] "FAO has broken its commitment to civil society and peasants' organisations". The letter complained that organisations representing the interests of farmers had not been consulted, that FAO was siding with the biotechnology industry and, consequently, that the report [...] "raises serious questions about the independence and intellectual integrity of an important United Nations agency". The Director General of FAO responded immediately, stating that decisions on biotechnology must [...] "be taken at the international level by competent bodies" [...] (in other words, not by non-governmental organizations). He acknowledged, however, that [...] "biotechnology research is essentially driven by the world's top ten transnational corporations" [...] and [...] "the private sector protects its results with patents in order to earn from its investment and it concentrates on products that have no relevance to food in developing countries".|$|E

They released a statement, calling {{it one of the most}} troublesome texts, relative to anti-Semitic potential, that any of us had seen in twenty-five years. It must be emphasized that the main storyline presented Jesus as having been relentlessly pursued by an evil cabal of Jews, headed by the high priest Caiaphas, who finally blackmailed a weak-kneed Pilate into putting Jesus to death. This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at Vatican II in its document Nostra aetate, and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents. ...
