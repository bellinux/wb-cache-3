40|$|Abstract {{approved}} In. Medford, Oregon, {{the major}} source of pollution is the lum-ber mill waste burner. Its low combustion efficiency results in the emission of large quantities of particulate into the atmosphere. Due to the influence of the atmospheric <b>radiation</b> <b>inversion</b> and possibly the poor performance of the burners at the time of start-up, concentrations of particulate were found to be highest in the morning. Correlating these morning concentrations with average surface rela-tive humidity, average surface wind speed, and various stability in-dices, most of which were determined from the U. S. Weather Bureau's 0300 PST radiosonde release, provided a measure of the degree of relationship between these meteorological factors and pollution. In addition, the analysis resulted in a determination of what stability factors could readily be used to predict pollution concentrations with reasonable accuracy (correlation coefficients> O. 65).

40|$|Infrared (IR) {{radiometry}} {{technology is}} an important method for characterizing the IR signature of targets, such as aircrafts or rockets. However, the received signal of targets could be reduced {{by a combination of}} atmospheric molecule absorption and aerosol scattering. Therefore, atmospheric correction is a requisite step for obtaining the real radiance of targets. Conventionally, the atmospheric transmittance and the air path radiance are calculated by an atmospheric radiative transfer calculation software. In this paper, an improved IR radiometric method based on constant reference correction of atmospheric attenuation is proposed. The basic principle and procedure of this method are introduced, and then the linear model of high-speed calibration in consideration of the integration time is employed and confirmed, which is then applicable in various complex conditions. To eliminate stochastic errors, radiometric experiments were conducted for multiple integration times. Finally, several experiments were performed on a mid-wave IR system with Φ 600 mm aperture. The radiometry results indicate that the <b>radiation</b> <b>inversion</b> precision of the novel method is 4. 78 – 4. 89 %, while the precision of the conventional method is 10. 86 – 13. 81 %...|$|E

The barrier jet interacts with a preexisting near-surface <b>radiation</b> <b>inversion</b> over the Ross Ice Shelf to set up conditions favorable for the development of large-amplitude mountain waves, leading to a downslope windstorm in the Ross Island area. Hydraulic theory can explain the structure of the downslope windstorms, with amplification of the mountain waves possibly caused by wave-breaking events. The underestimation of AMPS wind speed at McMurdo is caused by the misplacement of a hydraulic jump downstream of the downslope windstorms.

The first two cases examine data {{collected during the}} passage of a mesoscale cold-air intrusion, probably thunderstorm outflow, and a synoptic-scale cold front. In these studies the radar data are compared to conventional meteorological data obtained from the WKY tower facility for the purpose of radar data interpretation. It is shown that the acoustic radar echoes reveal the boundary between warm and cold air and other areas of turbulent mixing, regions of strong vertical temperature gradients, and areas of weak or no wind shear. The third case study examines the relationship between the nocturnal <b>radiation</b> <b>inversion</b> and the low-level wind maximum or jet in the light of conclusions presented by Blackadar (1957). The low-level jet is seen forming well above the top of the inversion. Sudden rapid growth of the inversion occurs which brings the top of the inversion to a height equal that of the jet. Coincident with the rapid growth of the inversion is a sudden decrease in the intensity of the acoustic radar echoes in the inversion layer. It is suggested that the decrease in echo intensity reveals a decrease in turbulent mixing in the inversion layer as predicted by Blackadar. It is concluded that the acoustic radar can be a valuable tool for study in the lower atmosphere...|$|E

In addition, the analysis resulted in a determination of what stability factors could readily be used to predict pollution concentrations with reasonable accuracy (correlation coefficients ≥ 0. 65). These included the sounding energy to 850 mb (energy required to lift a parcel of air from surface to 850 mb), the temperature difference index (difference in temperature between 850 mb and surface), the Modified Showalter Stability Index (Showalter Index applied to the layer of air between surface and 850 mb), and the persistence index (the sum of three weighted Modified Showalter Index values for three consecutive mornings). Graphical and regression prediction models involving the persistence index and average surface wind speed were developed. These relationships proved to be more accurate in predicting morning concentrations of particulate (multiple correlation coefficients 0. 84) than those involving only one meteorological variable (highest correlation coefficient = 0. 74). In order to illustrate the effects of air pollution on visibility, a preliminary relationship between concentrations of suspended particulate and visibility was developed.

The smoke from the combustion of coal has had a severe impact {{on the health of}} society in the townships and cities. To alleviate this escalating problem, the Department of Minerals and Energy of South Africa evaluated low-smoke fuels as an alternative source of energy. The technical and social implications of such fuels were investigated {{in the course of the}} Qalabotjha Low-Smoke Fuels Macro-Scale Experiment. Three low-smoke fuels (Chartech, African Fine Carbon [AFC], and Flame Africa) were tested in Qalabotjha during the winter of 1997. This paper examines diurnal variations of PM 10 (particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 mm) concentrations at the clinic site in Qalabotjha.

High-frequency time series of temperature T on a 60 -m tower showed that 1) the amplitudes of the T fluctuations were dramatically suppressed at levels above 30 m in contrast to the relatively larger intermittent T fluctuations in the shallow BL below, and 2) the temperature at 40 - to 60 -m height was nearly constant for several hours, indicating that the very cold air near the surface was not being mixed upward to those levels. The presence of this quiescent layer indicates that the atmosphere above the shallow BL was isolated and detached both from the surface and from the shallow BL. Although some of the nights studied had modestly stronger winds and traveling disturbances (density currents, gravity waves, shear instabilities), these disturbances seemed to pass through the region without having much effect on either the SBL structure or on the atmosphere–surface decoupling. The decoupling suggests that under very stable conditions, the surface-layer lower boundary condition for numerical weather prediction models should act to decouple and isolate the surface from the atmosphere, for example, as a free-slip, thermally insulated layer. A multiday time series of ozone from an air quality campaign in Tennessee, which exhibited nocturnal behavior typical of polluted air, showed the disappearance of ozone on weak low-level jets (LLJ) nights. This behavior is consistent with the two-stratum structure of the vSBL, and with the nearly complete isolation of the surface and the shallow BL {{from the rest of the}} atmosphere above, in contrast to cases with stronger LLJs, where such coupling was stronger...|$|E

To study the detailed rearrangement of low- and high-LET radiation induced chromosome aberrations in human epithelial cells (CH 184 B 5 F 5 /M 10) in vitro, we performed a series of experiments with Cs- 137 gamma rays of both low and high dose rates, neutrons of low dose rate and 600 MeV/u Fe ions of high dose rate, with chromosome 3 painted with multi-binding colors. We also compared the chromosome aberrations in both 2 - and 3 -dimensional cell cultures. Results of these experiments revealed the highest chromosome aberration frequencies after low dose rate neutron exposures. However, detailed analysis of the <b>radiation</b> induced <b>inversions</b> revealed that all three radiation types induced a low incidence of simple inversions. Most of the inversions in gamma-ray irradiated samples were accompanied by other types of intra-chromosomal aberrations but few inversions were accompanied by inter-chromosomal aberrations.

The location of the breaks involved in chromosome exchanges was analyzed along the painted chromosome. The breakpoint distribution was found to be randomly localized on chromosome 3 after neutron or Fe ion exposure, whereas non-random distribution with clustering breakpoints was observed after -ray exposure.

We tracked the changes in the canopy reflectance (450 – 2450 nm) and retrieved vegetation properties (Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), leaf water content (Cw), leaf dry matter content (Cdm) and senescent material (Cs)) during a drought episode. Spectroscopic techniques and radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion were employed to monitor the gradual manifestation of drought effects in a laboratory setting. Plots of 21 cm × 14. 5 cm surface area with Poa pratensis plants that formed a closed canopy were divided into a well-watered control group and a group subjected to water stress for 36 days. In a regular weekly schedule, canopy reflectance and destructive measurements of LAI and Cab were taken. Spectral analysis indicated the first sign of stress after 4 – 5 days from the start of the experiment near the water absorption bands (at 1930 nm, 1440 nm) and in the red (at 675 nm). Spectroscopic techniques revealed plant stress up to 6 days earlier than visual inspection. Of the water stress-related vegetation indices, the response of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI_ 1241) and Normalized Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI_norm) were significantly stronger in the stressed group than the control. To observe the effects of stress on grass properties during the drought episode, we used the RTMo (RTM of solar and sky <b>radiation)</b> model <b>inversion</b> by means of an iterative optimization approach. The performance of the model inversion was assessed by calculating R 2 and the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between retrieved and measured LAI (R 2 = 0. 87, NRMSE = 0. 18) and Cab (R 2 = 0. 74, NRMSE = 0. 15). All parameters retrieved by model inversion co-varied with soil moisture deficit. However, the first strong sign of water stress on the retrieved grass properties was detected as a change of Cw followed by Cab and Cdm in the earlier stages. The results from this study indicate that the spectroscopic techniques and RTMo model inversion have a promising potential of detecting stress on the spectral reflectance and grass properties before they become visibly apparent...|$|R

The Greenland ice sheet {{is treated as}} a monomineralic rock formation, primarily metamorphic, but with a sedimentary veneer of snow and firn. This sedimentary member is perennial above the firn line, and the classical methods of stratigraphy and sedimentation can be profitably applied to it. During a 4 -year period 146 pit studies and 288 supplementary Rammsonde profiles were made along 1100 miles of over-snow traverse (Fig. 1). Temperature, density, ram hardness, and grain size were measured in the strata exposed in each pit. Stratification of snow results from variations in the conditions of deposition and is emphasized by subsequent diagenesis. Summer layers are coarser-grained and have generally lower density and hardness values than winter layers; they may also show evidence of surface melt. The onset of fall is usually identified by an abrupt increase in density and hardness accompanied by a decrease in grain size. This stratigraphic discontinuity is used as the annual reference plane. Strata in the upper 10 to 20 meters compose a succession of annual sequences which are preserved in recognizable form for at least several decades. Correlation of annual layers between pits, spaced 10 to 25 miles apart along the traverse of Figure 1, gives a picture of annual accumulation during the past 5 to 20 years for western Greenland between 69 and 77 °N. The control established by these data, together with information from earlier expeditions (primarily those of Koch-Wegener and DeQuervain) and from permanent coastal meteorological stations, {{have been used to}} make a map showing the distribution of gross annual accumulation, essentially the equivalent of annual precipitation, for the entire ice sheet (Fig. 30). In general, the accumulation contours follow the north-south trend of the coast lines, with extremes of less than 10 cm H 2 O in the northeast and more than 90 cm H 2 O per year in the south; the average for the ice sheet is 34 cm H 2 O per year. The zone of maximum precipitation lies close to the coast in two regions, one on the east coast between Angmagssalik and Scoresbysund, the other on the west coast between Upernavik and Thule. In addition to the existence of a useful stratigraphic record four diagenetic facies are recognized on the ice sheet. (1) The ablation facies extends from the outer edge, or terminus, of the glacier to the firn line. The firn line is the highest elevation to which the annual snow cover recedes during the melt season. (2) The soaked facies becomes wet throughout during the melting season and extents from the firn line to the saturation line, i. e., the uppermost limit of complete wetting. The saturation line is the highest altitude at which the 0 °C isothermal surface penetrates to the melt surface of the previous summer. (3) The percolation facies is subjected to localized percolation of melt water from the surface without becoming wet throughout. Percolation can occur in snow and firn of sub-freezing temperatures with only the pipe-like percolation channels being at the melting point. A network of ice glands, lenses, and layers forms when refreezing occurs. This facies extends from the saturation line to the upper limit of surface melting, the dry-snow line. Negligible soaking and percolation occur above the dry-snow line. (4) The dry-snow facies includes all of the glacier lying above the dry-snow line, and negligible melting occurs in it. The saturation line can be identified by discontinuities in temperature, density, and ram hardness data, and it may also be located by examination of melt evidence in strata exposed on pit walls. It is as sharply defined as the firn line; but the dry-snow line, although determined by the same methods, is an ill-defined transition zone 10 - to 20 -miles wide. The facies represent a response to climate, therefore changes in the location of facies boundaries may be used as indicators of secular climatic change. Since facies are not restricted to the Greenland ice sheet, they provide the basis for a general classification of glaciers. This "facies classification" is areal in nature and gives a greater resolution of characteristics than Ahlmann's "geophysical classification. " In particular, the "facies classification" permits subdivision of large glaciers which span the entire range of environments from temperate to polar. Ahlmann's useful distinction between temperate and polar glaciers takes on new meaning in the light of glacier facies. Thus, a temperate glacier exhibits only the two facies below the saturation line whereas {{one or both of the}} facies above the saturation line are present on polar glaciers. An attempt has been made to map the distribution of facies on the Greenland ice sheet (Fig. 48). The distribution of mean annual temperature on the ice sheet may be approximated by gradients with respect to altitude and latitude of 1 °C/ 100 m and 1 °C per degree latitude respectively. The altitude gradient is controlled by strong outgoing <b>radiation,</b> producing deep <b>inversions</b> and katabatic winds. The katabatic winds are warmed adiabatically as they descend along the surface of the ice sheets and this is the primary control determining the temperature gradient along the snow surface. The latitude gradient is based on temperature measurements made above 2000 m on the ice sheets and on average values from meteorological stations spanning 20 ° of latitude on the west coast. A contour map of isotherms based on these gradients compares well with temperature values obtained from pits on the ice sheet. (Fig. 40). The densification of snow and firn is discussed for the case where melting is negligible. The assumption is that accumulation remains constant at a given location and, under this assumption, the depth-density curve is invariant with time as stated by Sorge's law. As a layer is buried it moves through a pressure gradient under steady-state conditions, and it is assumed that the decrease in pore space with increasing load is simply proportional to the pore spaces, i. e., [ [...] . ] where [ [...] . ] = specific volume of firn ([ [...] . ] = firn density), [ [...] . ] = specific volume of ice = 1. 09 cm 3 /g, [ [...] . ] = load at depth z below the snow surface and m = a constant which depends on the mechanism of densification. The depth-density equation obtained from equation 8 is [ [...] . ] where K = [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ] = void ratio for snow of density [ [...] . ], and [ [...] . ] = void ratio for snow of density [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ] = density of snow when [ [...] . ] = 0. The consequences of the assumption in equation 8 compare favorably with observation. A fundamental change in the mechanism of densification is recognized within 10 m of the snow surface. The concept of a "critical density" is introduced. Before the density of snow attains the critical value it is compacted primarily by packing of the grains. The critical density represents the maximum value obtainable by packing and further compaction must proceed by other mechanisms. The rate of change of volume with increasing load decreases by a factor of 4 when the critical density is exceeded. The same equations hold in the case where melt is not negligible but the rates of densification are higher. Bauer's (1955) estimate for the balance of the ice sheet is revised. Two corrections are applied: (1) the average annual accumulation value of 31 cm H 2 O originally estimated by Loewe (1936) is revised to 34 cm H 2 O as a result of this study; (2) the relative areas of ablation and accumulation zones in Greenland north of 76 °N are more accurately defined. The net result is a slightly positive balance which is interpreted to mean that the Greenland ice sheet is essentially in equilibrium with present day climate...|$|R
