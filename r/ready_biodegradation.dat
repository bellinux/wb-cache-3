30|$|The {{second step}} of the German PBT-strategy was to {{identify}} and to prioritise additional potential PBT- and vPvB-candidates among the substances pre-registered for 2010. During this prioritisation process the Federal Environment Agency made another experience: According to Annex IX of the Regulation, a standard requirement is information on biological degradation (Annex IX, 9.2. 1), especially tests simulating the degradability in different environmental compartments (simulation studies). Although most of the substances were registered with a production or import volume exceeding the 100 ton/year level, and also the 1, 000 ton/year level, no data on degradability and degradation half lives {{was included in the}} dossiers with the exception of <b>ready</b> <b>biodegradation</b> tests.|$|E
40|$|Extensive use {{of organic}} {{halogenated}} chemicals {{in many areas}} of agriculture and industry has resulted in widespread presence of toxic and carcinogenic compounds in the environment, creating many problems. Bacteria are able to degrade these harmful compounds, primarily by production of dehalogenating enzymes using them as sole sources of carbon and energy. Little is known about microbial adaptation during -haloacid (HA) degradation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate bacterial community and dehalogenase genes during degradation of 2 -chloropropionic acid (2 MCPA) in activated sludge and soil inoculated <b>Ready</b> <b>Biodegradation</b> Tests (RBT) format, using DNA based cultivation-independent and cultivation-dependent methods. Changes in the bacterial communities of activated sludge (AS) and soil (HS and LS) RBTs were monitored by analysis of bacterial 16 S rRNA and HA dehalogenase (dehI & dehII) genes. Bacterial 16 S rRNA gene DGGE profiles showed that several bacterial species (phylotypes) were persistent during 2 MCPA degradation, whilst other phylotypes were either enriched or appeared transiently. Some changes in the bacterial communites were associated with appearance of deh genes. At lower inoculum concentration of soil (LS-RBT), 2 MCPA degradation gave biphasic curve of dechlorination; the presence of a Comamonas phylotype during the initial stages of substrate degradation coincided with the presence of group II dehalogenases (dehII), and was replaced by Methylibium in the second phase of 2 MCPA degradation, coinciding with the presence of a group I dehalogenases (dehI). However, in the high inoculum of soil (HS) -RBT and AS-RBT, 2 MCPA degradation was completed more rapidly in a single phase, with enrichment of Herbaspirillum-like (in HS-RBT) phylotypes, and Caulobacter and Cupriavidus-like (in AS-RBT) phylotypes. Samples removed periodically from the RBTs were used to inoculate solid and liquid sub-cultures (2 or 10 mM 2 MCPA) for further enrichment and isolation of 2 MCPA-degrading bacteria. DGGE profiles of 16 S rRNA gene sequences from the AS-RBT revealed considerable differences from those of the liquid sub-cultures, suggesting that degradation of 2 MCPA was affected by and possibly determined by substrate concentration and presence of specific degraders in a system. The isolates obtained from soil and AS-RBTs, whether or not they reflected the RBT, were mainly Alphaproteobacteria, indicating the importance of these bacteria in degrading 2 MCPA. Four 2 MCPA-degrading bacteria, Afipia sp. KH 3, Rhizobium sp. KH 31, Herbaspirillum sp. KH 17 and Methylobacterium sp. KH 4, were isolated in this study and characterized phylogenetically and with respect to their dehalogenases. Among the genes involved in 2 MCPA degradation, the sequence of dehI of strain KH 17 was identical to that of dehI of Herbaspirillum sp. DA 1. This study showed there is significant bias during liquid sub-culture process, and highlights the advantage of using molecular based (PCR-DGGE) methods in investigating the actual contribution of bacteria population in degrading xenobiotics (HAs). Moreover, molecular genetic analyses were useful in monitoring the enrichment and isolation possesses...|$|E
40|$|Under the European REACH {{regulation}} (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical substances - (EC) No 1907 / 2006), {{there is}} an urgent need to acquire {{a large amount of}} information necessary to assess and manage the potential risk of thousands of industrial chemicals. Meanwhile, REACH aims at reducing animal testing by promoting the intelligent and integrated use of alternative methods, such as in vitro testing and in silico techniques. Among these methods, models based on quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) are useful tools to fill data gaps and to support the hazard and risk assessment of chemicals. The present thesis was performed {{in the context of the}} CADASTER Project (CAse studies on the Development and Application of in-Silico Techniques for Environmental hazard and Risk assessment), which aims to integrate in-silico models (e. g. QSARs) in risk assessment procedures, by showing how to increase the use of non-testing information for regulatory decision-making under REACH. The aim of this thesis was the development of QSAR/QSPR models for the characterization of the (eco-) toxicological profile and environmental behaviour of chemical substances of emerging concern. The attention was focused on four classes of compounds studied within the CADASTER project, i. e. brominated flame retardants (BFRs), fragrances, prefluorinated compounds (PFCs) and (benzo) -triazoles (B-TAZs), for which limited amount of experimental data is currently available, especially for the basic endpoints required in regulation for the hazard and risk assessment. Through several case-studies, the present thesis showed how QSAR models can be applied for the optimization of experimental testing as well as to provide useful information for the safety assessment of chemicals and support decision-making. In the first case-study, simple multiple linear regression (MLR) and classification models were developed ad hoc for BFRs and PFCs to predict specific endpoints related to endocrine disrupting (ED) potential (e. g. dioxin-like activity, estrogenic and androgenic receptor binding, interference with thyroxin transport and estradiol metabolism). The analysis of modelling molecular descriptors allowed to highlight some structural features and important structural alerts responsible for increasing specific ED activities. The developed models were applied to screen over 200 BFRs and 33 PFCs without experimental data, and to prioritize the most hazardous chemicals (on the basis of ED potency profile), which have been then suggested to other CADASTER partners in order to focus the experimental testing. In the second case-study, MLR models have been developed, specifically for B-TAZs, for the prediction of three key endpoints required in regulation to assess aquatic toxicity, i. e. acute toxicity in algae (EC 50 72 h Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata), daphnids (EC 50 48 h Daphnia magna) and fish (LC 50 96 h Onchorynchus mykiss). Also in this case, the developed QSARs were applied for screening purposes. Among over 350 B-TAZs lacking experimental data, 20 compounds, which were predicted as toxic (EC(LC) 50 ≤ 10 mg/L) or very toxic (EC(LC) 50 ≤ 1 mg/L) to the three aquatic species, were prioritized for further experimental testing. Finally, in the third case-study, classification QSPR models were developed for the prediction of ready biodegradability of fragrance materials. <b>Ready</b> <b>biodegradation</b> is among the basic endpoints required for the assessment of environmental persistence of chemicals. When compared with some existing models commonly used for predicting biodegradation, the here proposed QSPRs showed higher classification accuracy toward fragrance materials. This comparison highlighted the importance of using local models when dealing with specific classes of chemicals. All the proposed QSARs have been developed on the basis of the OECD principles for QSAR acceptability for regulatory purposes, paying particular attention to the external validation procedure and to the statistical definition of the applicability domain of the models. QSAR models based on molecular descriptors generated by both commercial (DRAGON) and freely-available (PaDELDescriptor, QSPR-Thesaurus) software have been proposed. The use of free tool allows for a wider applicability of the here proposed QSAR models. Concluding, the QSAR models developed within this thesis are useful tools to support hazard and risk assessment of specific classes of emerging pollutants, and show how non-testing information can be used for regulatory decisions, thus minimizing costs, time and saving animal lives. Beyond their use for regulatory purposes, the here proposed QSARs can find application in the rational design of new safer compounds that are potentially less hazardous for human health and environment...|$|E
40|$|Reliable {{prediction}} of the unsaturated zone transport and attenuation of dissolved-phase VOC (volatile organic compound) plumes leached from shallow source zones is a complex, multi-process, environmental problem. It {{is an important}} problem as sources, which include solid-waste landfills, aqueous-phase liquid discharge lagoons and NAPL releases partially penetrating the unsaturated zone, may persist for decades. Natural attenuation processes operating in the unsaturated zone that, uniquely for VOCs includes volatilisation, may, however, serve to protect underlying groundwater and potentially {{reduce the need for}} expensive remedial actions. Review of the literature indicates that only a few studies have focused upon the overall leached VOC source and plume scenario as a whole. These are mostly modelling studies that often involve high strength, non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) sources for which density-induced and diffusive vapour transport is significant. Occasional dissolved-phase aromatic hydrocarbon controlled infiltration field studies also exist. Despite this lack of focus on the overall problem, a wide range of process-based unsaturated zone — VOC research has been conducted that may be collated to build good conceptual model understanding of the scenario, particularly for the much studied aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs). In general, the former group is likely to be attenuated in the unsaturated zone due to their <b>ready</b> aerobic <b>biodegradation,</b> albeit with rate variability across the literature, whereas the fate of the latter is far less likely to be dominated by a single mechanism and dependent upon the relative importance of the various attenuation processes within individual site — VOC scenarios. Analytical and numerical modelling tools permit effective process representation of the whole scenario, albeit with potential for inclusion of additional processes — e. g., multi-mechanistic sorption phase partitioning, and provide good opportunity for further sensitivity analysis and development to practitioner use. There remains a significant need to obtain intermediate laboratory-scale and particularly field-scale (actual site and controlled release) datasets that address the scenario as a whole and permit validation of the available models. Integrated assessment of the range of simultaneous processes that combine to influence leached plume generation, transport and attenuation in the unsaturated zone is required. Component process research needs are required across the problem scenario and include: the simultaneous volatilisation and dissolution of source zones; development of appropriate field-scale dispersion estimates for the unsaturated zone; assessment of transient VOC exchanges between aqueous, vapour and sorbed phases and their influence upon plume attenuation; development of improved field methods to recognise and quantify biodegradation of CAHs; establishment of the influence of co-contaminants; and, finally, translation of research findings into more robust practitioner practice. ...|$|R
