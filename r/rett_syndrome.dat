5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS) {{as one of}} the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), {{which are}} a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as social deficits. Of the other four ASD forms, autism is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development; <b>Rett</b> <b>syndrome</b> and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{concerns}} that the Queen might be barren, Henry and Eleanor had five children together. In 1239 Eleanor gave birth to their first child, Edward, named after the Confessor. Henry was overjoyed and held huge celebrations, giving lavishly to the Church and to the poor to encourage God to protect his young son. Their first daughter, Margaret, named after Eleanor's sister, followed in 1240, her birth also accompanied by celebrations and donations to the poor. Henry's third child, Beatrice, was named after his mother-in-law, and born in 1242 during a campaign in Poitou. Their fourth child, Edmund, arrived in 1245 and was named after the 9th-century saint: concerned about Eleanor's health, Henry donated {{large amounts of money}} to the Church throughout the pregnancy. A third daughter, Katherine, was born in 1253 but soon fell ill, possibly the result of a degenerative disorder such as <b>Rett</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and was unable to speak. She died in 1257 and Henry was distraught. Henry's children spent most of their childhood at Windsor Castle and he appears to have been extremely attached to them, rarely spending extended periods of time apart from his family.|$|E

40|$|Antiepileptic {{therapy is}} one of the most urgent {{problems}} in the treatment of <b>Rett’s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> By taking into account a common concurrence of generalized and focal seizures with diffuse epileptiform activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in <b>Rett’s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> there are effective broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) : valproates, topiramate, levetiracetam, lamotrigine. Carbamazepine is effective for focal seizures and in the absence of diffuse EEG changes. For atypical absences, ethosuximide may be added to valproates, topiramate, or levetiracetam. Reflex seizures show a high resistance; their frequency is occasionally reduced by AEDs in combination with neuroleptics. Sleep hygiene, as well as medication (clonidine, zolpidem, trazodone, melatonin, risperidone) are recommended to correct various sleep disorders. Dopamine agonists, as well as L-carnitine are used for the drug correction of movement disorders in <b>Rett’s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Therapeutic exercises are one of the most optimal ways to correct movement disorders. Orthopedic correction, including surgery, is indicated for skeletal deformities. Vitamin D used for long periods of time is beneficial, by considering its deficiency and osteoporosis at a fracture risk in <b>Rett’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients who receive AEDs particularly long. A special high-fat diet and a fractional diet in small portions are used in the therapy of cachexia and growth retardation due to oral dysfunction and malnutrition. A cardiological follow-up is needed in abnormalities, such as prolonged Q interval, tachyarrhythmia, and cardiac structural anomalies. Systematic learning to maintain communication and motor skills are of importance.

500|$|Various {{lines of}} {{evidence}} undermine a proposed link between thiomersal and autism. For example, although advocates of a thiomersal-autism link consider autism {{a form of}} [...] "mercury poisoning," [...] the typical symptoms of mercury toxicity are significantly different from symptoms seen in autism. Likewise, the neuroanatomic and histopathologic features of the brains of patients who have mercury poisoning, both with methylmercury as well as ethylmercury, have significant differences from the brains of people with autism. Previous episodes of widespread mercury toxicity in a population such as in Minamata Bay, Japan would also be expected to lead to documentation of a significant rise in autism or autism-like behavior in children should autism be caused by mercury poisoning. However, research on several episodes of acute and chronic mercury poisoning have not documented any such rise in autism like behavior. Although some parents cite an association between the timing of onset of autistic symptoms with the timing of vaccinations as evidence of an environmental cause such as thiomersal, {{this line of reasoning}} can be misleading. Associations such as these do not establish causation as the two occurring together may be only coincidental in nature. Also, genetic disorders that have no environmental triggers such as <b>Rett</b> <b>syndrome</b> and Huntington's disease nevertheless have specific ages when they begin to show symptoms, suggesting specific ages of onset of symptoms does not necessarily require an environmental cause.|$|E

DHPR activity was found to be lowered in autism and <b>Rett's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> DHPR activity was unaffected in non specific mental retardation suggesting that the deficit seen in autism and <b>Rett's</b> <b>syndrome</b> does not arise secondary to the mental dysfunction. In Down's syndrome blood biopterin levels correlated with blood spot DHPR activity. Human brain BH 4 synthetic activity was investigated in aging and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT). BH 4 synthetic activity and DHPR activity decline with age in non-demented controls. In SDAT, decreases in BH 4 synthetic activity were seen in temporal and visual cortices and locus coeruleus. The site of the defect is probably at 6 -pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase. Aluminium inhibits human brain BH 4 synthesis in vitro and produces an `Alzheimeresque' pattern of abnormalities in rats chronically exposed to the acetate salt in drinking water. Aluminium appears to chiefly affect enzymes requiring a metal ion cofactor. Aluminium induced inhibition of BH 4 synthesis can be reversed by treatment with transferrin, an aluminium chelator. Transferrin treatment improves BH 4 synthetic {{activity in}} SDAT brains whilst having no effect on controls, further implicating aluminium as the key neurotoxin in SDAT. Lithium inhibits human brain BH 4 synthesis in vitro and lowers rat brain total biopterins and inhibits rat brain BH 4 synthesis on chronic exposure to the carbonate salt in drinking water. A possible mechanism for the anti-manic actions of lithium is suggested. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors decrease human brain BH 4 synthetic activity in vitro. 5 -methyl-tetrahydrofolate had no effect on human brain BH 4 synthesis in vitro but methionine increased BH 4 synthesis in vitro.

2500|$|When an {{affected}} {{individual has}} fully developed the three clinical elements of uric acid overproduction, neurologic dysfunction, and {{cognitive and behavioral}} disturbances, diagnosis of LNS is easily made. [...] Diagnosis is less easy in the early stages, when the three features are not yet obvious. Suspicion often comes about when the developmental delay of the individual is associated with hyperuricemia. Otherwise, the diagnosis should be alleged when developmental delay is associated with kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) or blood in the urine (hematuria), caused by uric acid stones. For the most part, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome is first suspected when self-inflicted injury behavior develops. However, self-injurious behaviors occur in other conditions, including nonspecific intellectual disability, autism, <b>Rett</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Tourette syndrome, familial dysautonomia, choreoacanthocytosis, sensory neuropathy including hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1, and several psychiatric conditions. Of these, only individuals with Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, de Lange syndrome, and familial dysautonomia recurrently display loss of tissue as a consequence. Biting the fingers and lips is a definitive feature of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome; in other syndromes associated with self-injury, the behaviors usually consist of head banging and nonspecific self-mutilation, but not biting of the cheeks, lips and fingers. Lesch–Nyhan syndrome ought to be clearly considered only when self-injurious behavior takes place in conjunction with hyperuricemia and neurological dysfunction.|$|E

Additionally, UCLA's large and highly collaborative neuroscience community was an ideal environment for the interdisciplinary studies that characterized work in the Silva laboratory. [...] The Silva laboratory became more involved in studying molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficits in genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. In the late nineties, cognitive deficits associated with this class of disorders {{were thought to be}} caused by genetic disruptions of brain development [...] Animal model studies of Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) in the Silva lab suggested that the learning and memory deficits associated with NF1 mutations are caused by changes in synaptic plasticity mechanisms in adults. Accordingly, a project led by Rui M. Costa in the Silva Lab demonstrated that the electrophysiological, and more importantly the behavioral deficits, caused by NF1 mutations could be reversed in adults by manipulations that corrected the molecular signaling deficits associated with these mutations. This discovery, and a series of later studies in many laboratories worldwide, have demonstrated the surprising efficacy of adult interventions in reversing cognitive phenotypes in animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders.

40|$|SummaryThe {{prevalence}} of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is rapidly growing, yet its molecular basis is poorly understood.

Next, proteome-wide screens for subunits co-complexed with HDAC 1 and six other key ASD proteins in human neuronal cells revealed a protein interaction network that displayed preferential expression in fetal brain development, exhibited increased deleterious mutations in ASD cases, and encompassed genes strongly regulated by FMRP and MECP 2, mutations that are causal for fragile X and <b>Rett</b> <b>syndromes,</b> respectively. Overall, our study reveals molecular components in ASD, suggests a shared mechanism between the syndromic and idiopathic forms of ASDs, and provides a groundwork for analyzing complex human diseases...|$|R
