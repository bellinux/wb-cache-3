5|$|The first French Grand Prix {{originated}} from the Gordon Bennett races, established by American millionaire James Gordon Bennett, Jr. in 1900. Intended to encourage automobile industries through sport, by 1903 the Gordon Bennett races had become {{some of the}} most prestigious in Europe; their formula of closed-road racing among similar cars replaced the previous model of unregulated vehicles racing between distant towns, over open roads. Entries into the Gordon Bennett races were by country, and the winning country earned the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>organise</b> the next race. Entries were limited to three per country, which meant that although the nascent motor industry in Europe was dominated by French manufacturers, they were denied the opportunity to fully demonstrate their superiority. Instead, the rule put them on a numerical level footing with countries such as Switzerland, with only one manufacturer, and allowed Mercedes, which had factories in Germany and Austria, to field six entries: three from each country. The French governing body, the Automobile Club de France (ACF), held trials between its manufacturers before each race; in 1904 twenty-nine entries competed for the three positions on offer.|$|E

25|$|In 1944, L'Auto was closed– {{its doors}} nailed shut– and its belongings, {{including}} the Tour, sequestrated {{by the state}} for publishing articles {{too close to the}} Germans. Rights to the Tour were therefore owned by the government. Jacques Goddet was allowed to publish another daily sports paper, L'Équipe, but there was a rival candidate to run the Tour: a consortium of Sports and Miroir Sprint. Each organised a candidate race. L'Équipe and Le Parisien Libéré had La Course du Tour de France and Sports and Miroir Sprint had La Ronde de France. Both were five stages, the longest the government would allow because of shortages. L'Équipes race was better organised and appealed more to the public because it featured national teams that had been successful before the war, when French cycling was at a high. L'Équipe was given the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>organise</b> the 1947 Tour de France. However, L'Équipes finances were never sound and Goddet accepted an advance by Émilion Amaury, who had supported his bid to run the post-war Tour. Amaury was a newspaper magnate whose condition was that his sports editor, Félix Lévitan should join Goddet for the Tour. The two worked together, Goddet running the sporting side and Lévitan the financial.|$|E

50|$|Based in Manchester, {{the union}} {{focussed}} on demanding members serve a seven-year apprenticeship. In 1894, it began admitting women. In the 1910s, the Association established a branch in London, but the Trades Union Congress instituted arbitration which restricted {{it from a}} fifteen-mile radius of central London, the rival London Society of Compositors having <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>organise</b> in the city.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, l'Auto {{was closed}} for collaborating with the Germans. The <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>organise</b> the Tour went to the French government. As two {{newspapers}} were interested in these rights, they each organised a small Tour of five stages, and the race run by L'Équipe was considered the more successful, therefore L'Équipe could organise the 1947 Tour de France.|$|R

2500|$|In 1984, GCHQ was {{the centre}} of a {{political}} row when the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher prohibited its employees from belonging to a trade union. It was claimed that joining a union would be in conflict with national security. A number of mass national one-day strikes were held to protest this decision, seen {{as a first step}} to wider bans on trade unions. Appeals to British Courts and European Commission of Human Rights were unsuccessful. The government offered a sum of money to each employee who agreed to give up their union membership. Appeal to the ILO resulted in a decision that government's actions were in violation of Freedom of Association and Protection of the <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Organise</b> Convention.|$|E
2500|$|In principle, UK law {{guarantees}} {{trade unions}} and their members freedom of association. This means people can organise their {{affairs in the}} way they choose, a right reflected in the ILO <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Organise</b> and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 and the European Convention on Human Rights, article 11. Under the ECHR article 11, freedom of association can only be restricted by law as is [...] "necessary in a democratic society". Traditional common law and equity was superficially similar, since unions form through contract, and the association's property is held on trust for its members according to the association's rules. However, before Parliament became democratic, unions were suppressed for allegedly being in [...] "restraint of trade" [...] and their actions (particularly strikes to improve conditions at work) could be regarded as criminal conspiracy. Nineteenth century reformers, who recognised that unions were democratic, gradually succeeded in guaranteeing unions' freedom of association. The Trade Union Act 1871 aimed to keep the courts away from unions' internal affairs, while the Trade Disputes Act 1906 finally confirmed the right of unions to take collective action, free from liability in tort, if it was [...] "in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute". The basic philosophy of [...] "legal abstention" [...] from union organisation lasted until 1971 when the Conservative government attempted comprehensive regulation. This intervention was reversed by Labour in 1974, but after 1979 unions became heavily regulated.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study of management’s attitudes and {{responses}} to union activities in 20 call centres in Western Australia. Australian unions have identified call centres as an important sector <b>to</b> <b>organise,</b> but past research has acknowledged the importance of employer recognition of union <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>organise</b> within the workplace as {{critical to the success}} of a union campaign. In addition, there is now substantial literature illustrating call centres as high control workplaces, and therefore difficult sites for unions <b>to</b> <b>organise,</b> although the question as to what extent these high control strategies reflect management’s attitude towards union organisation in call centres has been much less addressed. This article outlines management's stance towards unions within the sample of Western Australian call centres, detailing the forms their co-operation and resistance take. It explores the link between management's control strategies and their attitudes towards unions and, finally, identifies several factors influencing management's stance towards unions. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{those who}} have access to them, social and digital media provide unparalleled {{opportunities}} for crossing borders of all kinds, allowing advocates for women’s <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>organise</b> around, through, and despite national and cultural divides. In Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan’s useful and insightful definition of transnational feminism, it is through these very practices of border crossing—including interactions facilitated via digital and social media—that unequal power relations within and between feminisms are revealed (2000, 73). Indeed, in its discussions of these media, Feminist Media Studies has considered feminists’ continuing “struggle with issues of privilege and difference in online spaces” (Laura Portwood-Stacer and Susan Berridge 2014). In this essay I turn my attention to the specificities of this struggle in relation to campaigns addressing Violence Against Women, as illustrated by a recent Kenyan campaign called #JusticeforLiz...|$|R
