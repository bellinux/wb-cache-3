Twenty water treatment plants were {{found out in}} the Bhimavaram municipality region in West Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh, India. Approximately, each plant supplying potable water about 4000 to 5000 L/day. All plants are extracting ground water and treating through Reverse Osmosis (RO) process. At outlet, huge quantity of wasted water is being discharged into side drains in Bhimavaram municipality. One typical treatment plant was selected, and water at outlet was collected and Physical and chemical analysis was carried out as per producer described in APHA.

In the study, {{the effect of}} the number of bolts on the load capacity, energy dissipation, and stiffness of reinforced concrete beams were investigated by using anchor bolt of different numbers. Three strengthened with GFRP specimens, one flexural <b>reference</b> <b>specimen</b> designed in accordance to Regulation on Buildings Constructed in Disaster Areas rules, and one shear reinforcement insufficient <b>reference</b> <b>specimen</b> was tested. Anchorage was made on the surfaces of the beams in strengthened specimens using 2, 3 and 4 bolts respectively. All beams were tested under monotonic loads.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of self-compacting concrete (SCC) specimens reinforced with small-diameter steel tubes in lieu of reinforcing bars. Twenty specimens were cast and tested. Four specimens were reinforced with normal steel bars (<b>reference</b> <b>specimens)</b> and the remaining 16 with steel tubes. All specimens contained steel helices with a pitch of either 50 mm or 75 mm. Deformed steel bars of 16 -mm diameter {{were used in the}} four <b>reference</b> <b>specimens</b> as longitudinal reinforcement. Steel tubes of 33. 7 -mm outside diameter with 2 -mm wall thickness (ST 33. 7) and steel tubes of 26. 9 -mm outside diameter with 2. 6 -mm wall thickness (ST 26. 9) were used as longitudinal reinforcement in the remaining 16 specimens. The specimens were divided into five groups with four specimens in each group. From each group, one specimen was tested under concentric load, one under 25 -mm eccentric load, one under 50 -mm eccentric load, and one under flexural load. Although the nominal yield tensile strength of the steel bars was 150 and 250 MPa greater than the nominal yield tensile strength of steel tubes ST 33. 7 and ST 26. 9, respectively, the results revealed that steel tube reinforced self-compacting concrete (STR SCC) specimens have ultimate load similar to <b>reference</b> <b>specimens.</b> Ductility of concentrically loaded STR SCC specimens was higher than that of the <b>reference</b> <b>specimens.</b> This study also reveals the challenges associated with using steel tubes as longitudinal reinforcement in STR SCC column specimens due to slip of steel tubes in concrete and explores remedial measures for the slip of steel tubes...|$|R

40|$|Reinforcement {{corrosion}} is {{the most}} important deterioration mechanism affecting reinforced concrete infrastructures. After corrosion starts, expansive pressures are exerted onto the surrounding concrete, causing cracking and spalling of the cover concrete. The amount of cover cracking can possibly be reduced by using strain hardening cementitious composites (SHCCs). In this work, the ability of strain hardening cementitious composite to resist cracking due to corrosion of reinforcement is studied. An accelerated corrosion experiment is performed to speed up the corrosion process. Micro-computed X-ray tomography technique (CT-scanning) was used for monitoring rust formation during accelerated corrosion of reinforcement and subsequent cover cracking. Development of cracks in SHCC specimen was compared to a <b>reference</b> <b>specimen.</b> While the SHCC specimen developed a large number of small cracks, the <b>reference</b> <b>specimen</b> exhibited extensive spalling due to corrosion.

40|$|High {{strength}} concrete has higher strength but lower ductility. Inclusion of single type of fibers into concrete {{has been proven}} to improve the behavior of concrete to a limited extent. However, recently {{it was found that}} the behavior of concrete can be improved more with the addition of hybrid fiber i. e., a combination of different types of fiber. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on the behavior of Hybrid Steel Fibre Reinforced High Strength Concrete (HSFR-HSC). A total of eight cylinder specimens with 150 mm in diameter and 300 mm in height were cast and tested under uniaxial compression. Three different combinations of HSFR-HSC <b>specimens</b> and <b>reference</b> <b>specimens</b> without steel fibers were prepared. The first combination of HSFR-HSC included 1. 5 % Micro Steel (MS) fibers and 1 % Deformed Steel (DS) fibers. The second combination included 1. 5 % MS fibers and 1. 5 % Hooked-end Steel (HS) fibers. The third combination included 1 % DS fibers and 1. 5 % HS fibers. The experimental results showed that the addition of hybrid steel fibers improved the strength and ductility of high {{strength concrete}} compared to the <b>reference</b> <b>specimens.</b> The results also showed that the specimens reinforced with different hybrid steel fibers failed in a ductile manner, while the <b>reference</b> <b>specimens</b> failed in a brittle manner...|$|R
