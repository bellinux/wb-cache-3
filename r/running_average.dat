For example, the <b>running</b> <b>average</b> of the SSEP can be arranged to increase the luminance of a checkerboard stimulus if the amplitude of the SSEP falls below some predetermined value, and to decrease luminance if it rises above this value.

The resulting plot of stimulus luminance versus wavelength is a plot of the spectral sensitivity of the visual system.|$|E

For general convex programs, the convergence time of dual subgradient/gradient methods with simple <b>running</b> <b>averages</b> (<b>running</b> <b>averages</b> started from iteration 0) {{is known to}} be O(1 /ϵ^ 2). This paper shows that the convergence time for general strongly convex programs is O(1 /ϵ). This paper also considers a variation of the average scheme, called the sliding <b>running</b> <b>averages,</b> and shows that if the dual function of the strongly convex program is locally quadratic (Note that the locally quadratic property is implied by the locally strongly concave property.) then the convergence time of the dual gradient method with sliding <b>running</b> <b>averages</b> is O((1 /ϵ)). The convergence time analysis is further verified by numerical experiments. Comment: A short version is accepted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. The current version extends the previous (CDC conference) version as follows: (1) simplify proofs; (2) relax the smooth dual function assumption in Sec IV by showing it always holds; (3) improve convergence time from O(1 /ϵ^ 2 / 3) to O((1 /ϵ)) when dual function is locally quadrati...|$|R

The 365 -day <b>running</b> <b>averaged</b> (27 -day average residual) GEC and EUV {{were used to}} estimate the solar cycle (the solar rotation) variations of GEC and EUV. Two features, time lags of GEC to EUV and variation slopes of GEC versus EUV, were comparatively investigated for the solar cycle and solar rotation variations of GEC and EUV. The results indicate that GEC responses to the solar cycle and solar rotation variations of EUV are significantly different. The response of 27 -day average residual GEC to EUV shows significant time lags, with EUV leading GEC. The time lag is dominated by a 1 -day lag and generally presents a decrease trend with solar activity decreasing. However, there are no evident time lags for the response of 365 -day <b>running</b> <b>averaged</b> GEC to EUV. The variation slope of 365 -day <b>running</b> <b>averaged</b> GEC versus EUV is significantly higher than that of 27 -day average residual GEC versus EUV by ~ 40 %, and the difference of GEC versus EUV slope between the two timescales occurs in all seasons and at different latitudinal bands.

40|$|In various applications, {{the effect}} of errors in {{gradient-based}} iterations is of particular importance when seeking saddle points of the Lagrangian function associated with constrained convex optimization problems. Of particular interest here are problems arising in power control applications, where network utility is maximized subject to minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, maximum interference constraints, maximum received power constraints, or simultaneous minimum and maximum SINR constraints. Especially when the gradient iterations are executed in a disributed fashion, imperfect exchanges among the link nodes may result in erroneous gradient vectors. In order to assess and cope with such errors, two <b>running</b> <b>averages</b> (ergodic sequences) are formed from the iterates generated by the perturbed saddle point method, each with complementary strengths.
