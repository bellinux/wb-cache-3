The project is releasing its designs and control programs under the GNU GPL. The RepRap approach uses fused deposition modeling to manufacture plastic components, possibly incorporating conductive pathways for circuitry. Other components, such as steel <b>rods,</b> <b>nuts</b> and bolts, motors and separate electronic components, would be supplied externally.

40|$|The Department of Applied Physics and Electronics at Umeå University offers {{education}} and conducts {{research in the}} field of automation and robotics. To raise the competence in automation in the CODESYS development environment it’s proposed to build a remote controlled self-balancing robot as a testing platform which is then programmed using CODESYS for Raspberry Pi.   The chassis of the robot consists of laser-cut plexiglass plates, stacked {{on top of each other}} and fixed using threaded <b>rods,</b> <b>nuts</b> and washers. On these plates the robots’ electrical components, wheels and motors are attached.   The control system is designed as a feedback loop where the robots’ angle relative to the gravity vector is the controlled variable. A PID-controller is used as the system controller and a Kalman Filter is used to filter the input signals from the IMU board using input from both the accelerometer and the gyro.   The control system is implemented in CODESYS as a Function Block Diagram (FBD) using both pre-made, standard function blocks and customized function blocks. By using the in-built web-visualization tool the robot can be remote controlled via Wi-Fi.   After tuning the Kalman Filter through plot-analysis and the PID-controller through Ziegler-Nichols method the robot can stay balanced on a flat surface.   The robots’ performance is tested through a series of test scenarios of which it only completes one out of four. The project ran out of time before further testing could be done.   For future work one could improve the performance of the PID-controller through more sophisticated tuning methods. One can also add a steering-function or test different type of controllers...|$|R

Usually it is a steel bar or rod that runs inside the neck, beneath the fingerboard. Some are non-adjustable, but most modern truss <b>rods</b> have a <b>nut</b> at one or both ends that adjust its tension.

50|$|The two {{walkways}} {{were suspended}} from {{a set of}} 1.25 in diameter steel tie rods, with the second floor walkway hanging directly under the fourth floor walkway. The fourth floor walkway platform was supported on three cross-beams suspended by steel <b>rods</b> retained by <b>nuts.</b> The cross-beams were box girders made from C-channel strips welded together lengthwise, with a hollow space between them. The original design by Jack D. Gillum and Associates specified three pairs of rods running from the second floor to the ceiling. Investigators determined eventually that this design supported only 60% of the minimum load required by Kansas City building codes.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{construction}} tolerances, {{a means of}} adjustment, or regulation, of the action has to be provided. This is commonly done by having a threaded wire end on the wooden tracker <b>rods.</b> A circular <b>nut</b> varies the effective length of the tracker where it engages with {{other parts of the}} action. One objective of correct regulation is that the keys on each manual have the same rest height and distance of travel when pressed. The regulation wrongly set at one extreme can cause a note to sound when no keys are pressed. This may also be caused by the action sticking after the key is released. The other extreme is that notes do not sound, or sound feebly, when a key is pressed.|$|R
50|$|In most {{pendulum}} clocks {{the rate}} is adjusted by moving the bob up or down on the pendulum rod. Moving it up shortens the pendulum, making it beat more quickly, and causing the clock to gain time. In the most common arrangement, the bob {{is attached to the}} pendulum with an adjustment nut at the bottom, on the threaded end of the pendulum <b>rod.</b> Turning the <b>nut</b> adjusts the height of the bob. But some bobs have levers or dials to adjust the height. In some precision clocks there is a smaller auxiliary weight on a threaded shaft to allow more fine adjustment. Tower clocks sometimes have a tray mounted on the pendulum rod, to which small weights can be added or removed, to adjust the rate without stopping the clock.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} feasibility of developing an engine dynamic signal monitoring and diagnostic system for use on-line in a high volume engine manufacturing plant {{as well as in}} a research environment for the development of new engine components. The system will enable rapid and precise diagnostics of the production engine for identifying and locating manufacturing or assembly defects which do not include thermodynamics, combustion/or emission related defects. Recently published literature on engine noise and vibration monitoring and diagnostic systems is reviewed with special emphasis on the use of noise and vibration for on-line monitoring and diagnosing. A complete bibliography of 175 references is appended, together with the summary chart outlining the subject classified by topics. The feasibility of using noise and vibration for the detection of engine manufacturing and assembly defects as well as evaluating the effectiveness of component design changes, was originally carried out in the dynamometer laboratory. Here, customer returned engines were evaluated for noise and vibration using three different monitoring systems developed for the same purposes. In these systems accelerometers, microphones and pressure transducers were used in conjunction with both a conventional dynamic signal analyzer and a specially designed eight channel data acquisition system coupled with custom designed computer programs. All these systems are capable of detecting defects in customer returned engines. Detail reviews were carried out emphasizing {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each system. The noise and vibration measurements were then correlated with actual manufacturing and assembly defects. The systems were also tested for evaluating the noise and vibration characteristics of changes in piston design. With the success in diagnosing customer returned engines, a field study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of using noise and vibration for detecting missing connecting rod bearings, loose connecting <b>rod</b> <b>nuts,</b> and other related manufacturing/assembly defects. A modified monitoring system which includes accelerometers and microphones together with a uniquely designed data acquisition system was used to obtain the noise and vibration data. In the initial phase, data was collected from fifteen partially completed engines having different defects. These were then analyzed to set the vibration limits for rejection. The on-line engine monitoring and diagnostic system was implemented and it was observed that in the test of more than 120, 000 engines, the success rate in reduction of defective engines was 100 percent. Thus it was concluded that the monitoring system with a specially designed data acquisition system is capable of on-line monitoring and rapid and precise diagnosing of production engines with manufacturing and/or assembly defects. The system is also well suited for use in evaluating the noise and vibration characteristics of any engine when one or more of its components has undergone design changes.

50|$|The Black Covered Bridge {{spanning}} Talawanda Creek {{just north}} of the Oxford City limits was constructed in 1868. The bridge was renovated in 1998 and can be viewed by the passerby from the current SR 732 bridge by looking upstream (west). This bridge spans Talawanda Creek which is 209 ft wide at this point. It is exceeded in length by only a few Ohio covered bridges. Built by Bandin, Butin and Bowman in 1868 and 1869, it incorporates both the truss style of Childs and that of Long in one bridge. The first version was an arched structure with a roadway width of 18 ft. In 1869 a stone pier was added as a support beneath the center of the bridge. The bow in the bridge was removed by replacing some wooden cross members with threaded iron <b>rods.</b> The <b>nuts</b> at the ends of these were loosened so that the bow was straightened and the middle of the bridge was lowered onto the pier. The bridge is so named to distinguish it from the white bridge east of Oxford and was useful in servicing Pugh's Mill at the time of construction.The Butler County Engineers Office-BCEO indicates that SR732 was rerouted in 1951 to use the current bridge crossing Talawanda Creek a few hundred feet east of the Black Bridge. There being no other bridge piers in evidence shows that the Black Bridge carried SR732 until 1951.|$|R
40|$|International audienceCoda Wave Interferometry (CWI), {{a method}} to {{evaluate}} subtle changes of elastic wave velocity in a medium, has been proven to be effective to detect small changes or ultrasonic velocity in concrete caused by load, temperature, moisture, damage or other means. While classical CWI is just able to determine velocity changes globally in relatively large areas between and around pairs of transmitters and receivers, several approaches have been proposed to identify the area affected by the changes more precisely. Most of them {{are based on the}} calculation of sensitivity kernels for de-correlation of signals measured at a specific state against a reference. Others follow simplified approaches. In a laboratory setup a concrete specimen of 1. 5 by 1. 5 by 0. 5 m m³ was compressed at a certain point by a thread <b>rod,</b> screw <b>nuts</b> and 10 by 10 cm m³ load distribution plates including a load cell to measure the effective load. Maximum loads of 20 to 100 kN (more than one orders of magnitude below the compressive strength of the concrete) have been applied in 5 to 10 kN steps in various cycles. The specimen is equipped with 18 embedded ultrasonic broadband piezo transceivers (60 kHz central frequency). Ten of these receivers have been connected to a multiplexer and ultrasonic transmitting and receiving equipment in a way that allowed almost continuous two way measurements between all sensor pairs. Some of the sensors have been just a few cm away {{from the center of the}} load, some almost 1 m. Even simple ways to evaluate the data (e. g. crosscorrelation between signals at different load states) allowed pinpointing the load center at least approximately. A more detailed data evaluation either using CWI or even more one of the more sophisticated localization algorithms gave Òsharperî results in terms of localization and a better correlation between load and velocity change/de-correlation. Referencing the results to the transmitter-receiver pair least affected by load change has led to further improvement. The results are used in upcoming monitoring systems for concrete structures...|$|R
40|$|Following {{recent studies}} on the fatigue {{behaviour}} of noise barriers for high speed railways for train transits, threaded rods bonded with epoxy resin for column base plate anchorage had to be qualified. A fatigue test campaign was carried out at Fischer Laboratories in Denzlingen (Germany) on M 20 and M 30 (8. 8 Grade) threaded rod samples embedded in concrete by means of FIS EM epoxy resin. The tests considered also threaded rods (M 16 and M 30, 8. 8 Grade) not directly embedded in concrete, but in pre-cast corrugated pipes having a diameter constant and equal to 40 mm. The results {{were found to be}} very satisfactory as far as the resin performance was concerned. In fact, under tensile loads carried out under a nominal load ratio R 0, all fatigue failures took place in the threaded <b>rods,</b> under the <b>nut,</b> notwithstanding the embedment length was that suggested by technical manuals for static loading. Some typical fracture surfaces relating to medium and high cycle fatigue regime are documented. A statistical re-analysis has been carried out considering also other data, either obtained at Fischer laboratories from analogous threaded applications or taken from the literature. A new scatterband is provided for threaded rods with diameter equal to or less than 20 mm...|$|R
60|$|On the 24th of September, in 1857, as I was {{paddling}} {{down the}} Assabet, in this town, I saw a red squirrel {{run along the}} bank under some herbage, with something large in its mouth. It stopped near {{the foot of a}} hemlock, within a couple of rods of me, and, hastily pawing a hole with its forefeet, dropped its booty into it, covered it up, and retreated part way up the trunk of the tree. As I approached the shore to examine the deposit, the squirrel, descending part way, betrayed no little anxiety about its treasure, and made two or three motions to recover it before it finally retreated. Digging there, I found two green pig-nuts joined together, with the thick husks on, buried about {{an inch and a half}} under the reddish soil of decayed hemlock leaves,--just the right depth to plant it. In short, this squirrel was then engaged in accomplishing two objects, to wit, laying up a store of winter food for itself, and planting a hickory wood for all creation. If the squirrel was killed, or neglected its deposit, a hickory would spring up. The nearest hickory tree was twenty <b>rods</b> distant. These <b>nuts</b> were there still just fourteen days later, but were gone when I looked again, November 21, or six weeks later still.|$|R
