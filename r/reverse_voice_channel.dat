40|$|Abstract:- Nowadays, GSM <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> {{network is}} the most {{consumed}} by mobile communication users in the world [1]. However, the GSM <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> network is currently vulnerable to hardware-based attacks and easy to be intercepted [2]. Current end-to-end secure communication solutions over the GSM <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> network have a big challenge {{on how to get}} an efficient synchronization of cryptographic devices on both ends. The efficient synchronization method helps to recover fully the original voice after decryption with very minimize delay and distortion. This paper presents an enhanced synchronization system for the synchronization improvement by manipulating the Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) coded voice from/to the cryptographic devices at both ends.

End-to-end analog telephone networks were first modified in the early 1960s by upgrading transmission networks with Digital Signal 1 (DS1/T1) carrier systems, designed to support the basic 3 kHz <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> by sampling the bandwidth-limited analog voice signal and encoding using PCM. While digitization allows wideband voice on the same channel, the improved quality of a wider analog <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> did not find a large market in the PSTN.|$|R

This paper {{is devoted to}} the analysis of a particular channel-sharing strategy, in which voice traffic always occupies its channels when available, but data service is allowed to occur on empty <b>voice</b> <b>channels.</b> <b>Voice</b> traffic is taken to be of high priority; voice arrivals that find all <b>voice</b> <b>channels</b> busy are treated as losses. Note that voice traffic will be relatively infrequent as compared to data, and will also exhibit relatively long holding (service) times. Data traffic is taken to be heavy, and exhibits very short holding times (per word unit) : compared to voice, data appears to arrive nearly continuously; when all data (and empty <b>voice)</b> <b>channels</b> are filled, queueing occursChief of Naval Research, Arlington, VA[URL] N 0001480 WR 00054 N...|$|R

40|$|Smartphone {{security}} {{has become increasingly}} more significant as smartphones become a more important part of many individuals 2 ̆ 7 daily lives. Smartphones undergo all computer security issues; however, they also introduce {{a new set of}} security issues as various capabilities are added. Smartphone security researchers pay more attention to security issues inherited from the traditional computer security field than smartphone-related security issues. The primary network that smartphones are connected to is the cellular network, but little effort has been directed at investigating the potential security issues that could threaten this network and its end users. A new possible threat that could occur in the cellular network is introduced in this paper. This research proves the ability to use the cellular network <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> as a covert channel that can convey covert information as speech, thus breaking the network policies. The study involves designing and implementing multiple subsystems in order to prove the theory. First, a software audio modem that is able to convert digital data into audio waves and inject the audio waves to the GSM <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> was developed. Moreover, a user-mode rootkit was implemented in order to open the <b>voice</b> <b>channels</b> by stealthily answering the incoming voice call, thus breaking the security mechanisms of the smartphone. Multiple scenarios also were tested in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed covert channel. The first scenario is a covert communication between two parties that intends to hide their communications by using a network that is unknown to the adversary and not protected by network security guards. The two parties communicate through the cellular network <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> to send and receive text messages. The second scenario is a side channel that is able to leak data such as SMS or the contact of a hacked smartphone through the cellular network <b>voice</b> <b>channel.</b> The third scenario is a botnet system that uses the <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> as command and control channel (C 2). This study identifies a new potential smartphone covert channel, so the outcome should be setting countermeasures against this kind of breach...|$|R

Recent work has shown the viability of transmitting data over a GSM <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> by disguising the ”data channel ” as a human voice engaged in a phone call, but these works have avoided the practical issues of cost and proliferation. We seek to build a lightweight, low-cost data communication platform for deployment on existing or growing technologies in the developing world.

50|$|The DMR {{standard}} operates {{within the}} existing 12.5 kHz channel spacing used in land mobile frequency bands globally, but achieves two <b>voice</b> <b>channels</b> through two-slot TDMA technology {{built around a}} 30 ms structure. The modulation is 4-state FSK, which creates four possible symbols over the air {{at a rate of}} 4,800 symbols/s, corresponding to 9,600 bit/s. After overhead, forward error correction, and splitting into two channels, there is 2,450 bit/s left for a single <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> using DMR, compared to 4,400 bit/s using P25 and 64,000 bit/s with traditional telephone circuits.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{system for}} {{measuring}} time-variant impulse responses and {{a database of}} such measurements for the aeronautical <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> are presented. Maximum length sequences (MLS) are transmitted over the <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> with a standard aeronautical radio and the received signals are recorded. For the purpose of synchronisation, both the transmitted and received signals are recorded in parallel with a GPS-based timing signal. The flight path of the aircraft is accurately tracked. A collection of recordings of MLS transmissions is generated during flights with a general aviation aircraft. The measurements cover {{a wide range of}} typical flight situations as well as static back-to-back calibrations. The resulting database is made available under a public licence free of charge. The estimated time-variant impulse responses provide a characterisation of the aeronautical <b>voice</b> <b>channel.</b> This characterisation is needed for improvements and add-ons to voice communication systems as in air traffic control, where the analogue radio will remain in use for many years to come.
