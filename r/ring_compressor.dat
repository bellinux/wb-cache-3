40|$|This report sums up {{the current}} {{knowledge}} on basic thermodynamics, heat trans-fer etc. Combining this information and the design goals presented in the Description Of Work (DOW) {{has resulted in a}} set of target values that reflect on the design specifications. The analysis has lead to the formulation of a rating condition and a set of design goals regarding capacity and efficiency at full load and part load respectively: • Rating condition: Temperature, outdoor = + 7 °C, indoor = + 20 °C • Full load (100 %) : Heating capacity = 3. 6 kW with COP = 3. 0 • Part load (50 %) : Heating capacity = 1. 8 kW with COP = 4. 7 Design specifications on noise etc. are also included. All global target values are chosen to be competitive with current best practice, in particular at the all important part load condition (this is backed by an up-to-date market analysis). The design focus is on a rotating heat pump with liquid-ring compressor. At this, introductory stage, much of the effort has been directed to the garner information on liquid <b>ring</b> <b>compressor</b> design, fan principles and heat transfer at moving surfaces. Preliminary analysis on the required component performance to be able to reach the listed design goals above has resulted in design target values for: • compressor Carnot efficiency (in a heating heat pump cycle), • air-flow capacities at the condenser and evaporator respectively, • heat exchanger efficiencies and heat transfer capacities, The critical design condition is part load capacity at the condenser and full capacity at the evaporator. As most of the operating hours will be at part load, given the desire to achieve reasonable energy coverage, part-load performance will be paramount. Hence a full chapter is devoted to new motor and motor-drive technology to achieve high efficiency even at low capacity turn-down ratios. This includes BLDC (BrushLess DC) as well as PMSM (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor) techniques. First impression from the analysis of the refrigerant side is that a hydro carbon, e. g. R 290 propane, is a likely first choice. Important issues to tackle will be the compatibility between the refrigerant and the lubricating and sealing fluids...|$|E

The plant is operated by Johannesburg Water and discharges to the sensitive Vaal Barrage catchment. The plant {{has a large}} anaerobic digestion facility, originally equipped with steam heating and gas mixing facilities.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The most {{critical}} part of the accelerator of the European Spallation Source [1] is the loss free injection into the <b>compressor</b> <b>rings.</b> Due to the 5. 1 MW average beam power at 1. 334 GeV, particle loss above 10 [...] 7 /m forbids unconstrained hands on maintenance of accelerator components. At the injection of the 1. 2 msec long linac pulse into the two <b>compressor</b> <b>rings</b> the loss must be here at the 10 [...] 5 level. For achieving this with a 1000 turn H [...] injection scheme the linac beam has to be truncated in both transverse planes. The mean kinetic energy has to be varied by 4 MeV during injection, corresponding to 2210 [...] 3 1 p/p ramping. Less than 10 particles above an energy spread of 2 MeV should {{be accepted by the}} stripping foil.

40|$|Simulations for linear {{colliders}} {{are traditionally}} per-formed separately {{for the different}} sub-systems, like damp-ing <b>ring,</b> bunch <b>compressor,</b> linac, and beam delivery. The beam properties are usually passed from one sub-system to the other via bunch charge, RMS transverse emit-tances, RMS bunch length, average energy and RMS en-ergy spread. It is implicitly assumed that the detailed 6 D correlations in the beam distribution are not relevant for the achievable luminosity. However, it has recently been shown that those correlations can have a strong effect on the beam-beam interaction. We present first results on CLIC [1] simulations that integrate linac, beam delivery, and beam-beam interaction. These integrated simulations also allow a better simulation of time-dependent effects, like ground perturbations and interference between several beam-based feedbacks. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{first stage}} bunch {{compressor}} in the NLC injector complex compresses the e+/e- beams from a bunch length of 5 mm rms to 0. 5 mm rms at the beam energy of 2 GeV. To obtain this compression ratio, the compressor rf section operates with an rf frequency of 1. 4 GHz and a voltage of about 140 MV while a magnetic wiggler {{is used to}} generate an R 56 = 0. 5 m. The bunch compressor is designed to operate with a beam from the damping ring that has a bunch spacing slew of 20 ps across the bunch train due to the transient loading in the damping <b>rings.</b> The <b>compressor</b> RF section is required to produce a specific energy profile along the bunch train so that the bunch spacing can be corrected in the compressor bending section.

Owing to the de-mands of environment protection, the CFCs and HCFCs refrigerants will {{be phased out}} in a short time, and new refrigerants such as R 600, R 134 a and R 407 C will be used. As the new refrigerant is selected, the motion regularity of the valves will be changed. The motion regularity of the ring valves of a 2 -stage refrigerating piston compressor is simu-lated, and the calculations are done respectively with refrigerants R 717 (ammonia), R 22 and R 134 a. The results show that refrigerants and working conditions of a compressor have a direct effect on {{the motion of the}} ring valves. Comparing the original design pa-rameters of the ring valves with the modified ones, the former are effective for the HCFC refrigerants, the latter have perfect motion of the valves for the new refrigerants, and the refrigeration system performance parameters, such as input power, the refriger-ating quantity and the COP value, are also better.

40|$|A Muon Collider (MC) and a Neutrino Factory (NF) - {{which may}} be {{considered}} as a step towards a MC - both require a high-power ({approx} 4 MW) proton driver providing short (< 1 m r. m. s. length) bunches for muon production. However, the driver repetition rates required for these two machines are different: {approx} 15 Hz for MC and {approx} 60 Hz for NF. This difference suggests employing two separate rings: one for accumulation of the proton beam from the Project-X linac in a few (e. g. 4) long bunches, the other for bunch compression - one by one for NF or all at a time for MC with simultaneous delivery to the target. The lattice requirements for these two rings are different: the momentum compaction factor in the accumulator ring should be large (and possibly negative) to avoid the microwave instability, while the <b>compressor</b> <b>ring</b> can be nearly isochronous in order to limit the required RF voltage and reduce the dispersion contribution to the beam size.

The friction heat produced between the first piston ring and the cylinder was far more than the rest, which cannot be diffused rapidly through the low conductivity self-lubricating plastics and led to thermal failure of the self-lubricating piston rings.
