Converting an existing bicycle by retrofitting it with a [...] "conversion kit" [...] is the simplest and least expensive electric vehicle conversion option.

Some experimenters have even used super capacitors to store energy. Using an on-board generator may impact the legal jurisdictional definition of an electric bicycle. A few types of electric bicycles are able to re-capture {{a small amount of}} energy from braking and can re-charge the batteries while braking or traveling down hills (regenerative braking).|$|E

An alternative way of overcoming such drawbacks is to adopt a mixed cathode material consisting of LCO and Li(Co,Mn,Ni) O 2. 1, 2 Another benefit obtainable from the mixed cathode is enhancement in the electrical capacity and energy density by increasing the degree of utilization of the cathode materials, which is possible by increasing the charging voltage to greater than 4. 2 V.

40|$|Enabling {{the use of}} lithium metal anodes is a {{critical}} step required to dramatically increase the energy density of <b>rechargeable</b> <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> dendrite growth in lithium metal batteries, {{and a lack of}} fundamental understanding of the factors governing this growth, is a limiting factor preventing their adoption. Herein we present the effect of battery cycling temperature, ranging from 90 to 120 ◦C, on dendrite growth through a polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide) -based electrolyte. This temperature range encompasses the glass transition temperature of polystyrene (107 ◦C). A slight increase in the cycling temperature of symmetric lithium-polymer-lithium cells from 90 to 105 ◦C results in a factor of five decrease in the amount of charge that can be passed before short circuit. Synchrotron hard X-ray microtomography experiments reveal a shift in dendrite location from primarily within the lithium electrode at 90 ◦C, to primarily within the electrolyte at 105 ◦C. Rheological measurements show a large change in mechanical properties over this temperature window. Time-temperature superposition was used to interpret the rheological data. Dendrite growth characteristics and cell lifetimes correlate with the temperature-dependent shift factors used for time-temperature superposition. Our work represents a step toward understanding the factors that govern lithium dendrite growth in viscoelastic electrolytes...|$|E

40|$|Lithium metal has {{the highest}} {{volumetric}} and gravimetric energy density of all negative electrode materials, when used as an electrode material in a lithium <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery.</b> <b>However,</b> the formation of lithium dendrites and/or “moss ” on the metal electrode surface can lead to short circuits, following several electrochemical charge-discharge cycles, particularly at high rates, rendering this class of batteries potentially unsafe and unusable due {{to the risk of}} fire and explosion. Many recent investigations have focused on the development of methods to prevent moss/dendrite formation. In parallel, it is important to quantify Li moss formation, to identify the conditions under which it forms. Although optical and electron microscopy can visually monitor the morphology of lithium electrode surface and hence the moss formation, such methods are not well suited for quantitative studies. Here we report the use of in-situ NMR spectroscopy, to provide time-resolved, quantitative information {{about the nature of the}} metallic lithium deposited on lithium metal electrodes.

We report the intrinsic ORR activity on glassy carbon (GC) as well as polycrystalline Au and Pt electrodes, where Au is the most active with an activity trend of Au > GC > Pt. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements were used to obtain the kinetic current of the ORR and the reaction order with respect to oxygen partial pressure in 1 M LiClO[subscript 4] propylene carbonate: 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane (1 : 2 v/v). In addition, air electrodes with Vulcan carbon or Au or Pt nanoparticles supported on Vulcan were examined in Li–O[subscript 2] single cells, where the observed discharge cell voltages follow the catalytic trend established by RDE measurements. The ORR mechanism and the rate-determining steps were discussed and contrasted with the ORR activity trend in acid and alkaline solutions. National Science Foundation (U. S.).

40|$|A {{composite}} {{consisting of}} sulfur/dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile {{is one of}} the most promising cathode materials for use in <b>rechargeable</b> lithium–sulfur <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> the reported sulfur contents have been low, less than 50 wt%, which compromise the intrinsic high specific capacity and energy of elemental sulfur and hence decrease significantly the specific energy of the composite. To identify the potential to further increase the sulfur content, we elucidate the binding mechanism of sulfur and polyacrylonitrile in their composite. The heat treatment experiments at varying timespans with excess sulfur showed a constancy of sulfur content after a critical length of timespan, indicating the saturation of sulfur in the structure of dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile. Based on molecular structure and size consideration, it is proposed that the binding involves the formation of an 8 membered ring of sulfur embedded between 4 heterocyclic rings of dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile. From this model and experimental results, we show that there exists an upper limit of sulfur content in the sulfur/dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile composite at 56 wt%...|$|R
40|$|A {{new family}} of fluorosulfates has {{attracted}} considerable attention as alternative positive electrode materials for <b>rechargeable</b> lithium <b>batteries.</b> <b>However,</b> an atomic-scale {{understanding of the}} ion conduction paths in these systems is still lacking, and this is important for developing strategies for optimization of the electrochemical properties. Here, the alkali-ion transport behavior of both LiFeSO 4 F and NaFeSO 4 F are investigated by atomistic modeling methods. Activation energies for numerous ion migration paths through the complex structures are calculated. The results indicate that LiFeSO 4 F is effectively a three-dimensional (3 D) lithium-ion conductor with an activation energy of similar to 0. 4 eV for long-range diffusion, which involve a combination of zigzag paths through [100], [010], and [111] tunnels in the open tavorite lattice. In contrast, for the related NaFeSO 4 F, only one direction ([101]) is {{found to have a}} relatively low activation energy (0. 6 eV). This leads to a diffusion coefficient that is more than 6 orders of magnitude lower than any other direction, suggesting that NaFeSO 4 F is a one-dimensional (1 D) Na-ion conductor...|$|R

NaFe 0. 5 Co 0. 5 O 2 delivers approximately 160 mAhg− 1 of reversible capacity with relatively good capacity retention and excellent rate-capability in a voltage range of 2. 5 – 4. 0 V, resulting in reversible formation of Na 0. 3 Fe 0. 5 Co 0. 5 O 2.

30|$|MXenes {{presents}} a low diffusion barrier for intercalation of various alkali metal ions between their sheets and therefore is {{not suitable for}} application as negative electrode materials in non-Li ion <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> systems [48]. <b>However,</b> depending on the fabrication technique {{and the type of}} terminating agent, various MXenes can function in a range of potential windows, thereby providing considerable flexibility in terms of their performance [48]. It has been observed that MXenes of the general formula M 2 X tend to demonstrate greater specific capacities than the ones with their corresponding higher molecular weight counterparts such as M 3 X 2 and M 4 X 3, since the low-formula-weight MXenes can store a greater number of ions [134]. The presence of the terminating functional group has been demonstrated to significantly affect the net specific capacity exhibited by the MXene, e.g., MXenes with oxygen-containing terminating groups exhibit much larger specific capacity than those with fluorine-containing groups [135]. The addition of intercalating particles between the MXene sheets has been shown to greatly enhance their specific capacity and electrode longevity [136].|$|R
