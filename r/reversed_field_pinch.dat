25|$|Magnetic Loops Another {{example of}} {{magnetic}} confinement is {{to bend the}} field lines back on themselves, either in circles or more commonly in nested toroidal surfaces. The most highly developed system of this type is the tokamak, with the stellarator being next most advanced, followed by the <b>Reversed</b> <b>field</b> <b>pinch.</b> Compact toroids, especially the Field-Reversed Configuration and the spheromak, attempt to combine the advantages of toroidal magnetic surfaces with those of a simply connected (non-toroidal) machine, resulting in a mechanically simpler and smaller confinement area.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{stabilising}} {{force was}} lower than the force available in the pinch, it lasted considerably longer. It appeared that a reactor could be built that would approach the Lawson criterion from a different direction; through extended confinement times rather than increased density. This {{was similar to the}} stellarator approach in concept, and although it would have lower field strength than those machines, the energy needed to maintain the confinement was much lower. Today this approach is known as the <b>reversed</b> <b>field</b> <b>pinch</b> (RFP) and has been a field of continued study.|$|E
50|$|The {{confinement}} of plasma in {{devices such}} as tokamaks, spherical tokamaks, and <b>reversed</b> <b>field</b> <b>pinches</b> requires the presence of closed magnetic flux surfaces. By changing the magnetic topology, magnetic reconnection degrades confinement by disrupting these closed flux surfaces, allowing the hot central plasma to mix with cooler plasma closer to the wall.|$|R
40|$|In {{thermonuclear}} fusion plasmas, transport losses are usually {{believed to be}} caused by turbulent fluctuations. Particularly in the outer region of tokamaks, stellarators and <b>reversed</b> <b>field</b> <b>pinches,</b> electrostatic turbulence accounts for particle transport. In tokamaks, electrostatic fluctuations can also be responsible for the radial energy flux; in <b>reversed</b> <b>field</b> <b>pinches,</b> energy transport cannot be ascribed to electrostatic turbulence only. In the plasma edge of the <b>reversed</b> <b>field</b> experiment device, identified as the region between the toroidal field reversal and the first wall, an extensive study of magnetic fluctuations and of the related radial energy flux has been performed. It is found that magnetic fluctuations carry most of the radial flux of energy. However, close to the wall the magnetic fluctuation-driven energy flux decreases abruptly, so that another mechanism must be invoked. There are indications that the energy flux channel in this region is the macroscopic magnetic deformation due to the phase locking of magnetic modes...|$|R
50|$|A {{stellarator}} is {{a magnetic}} confinement fusion device which generates all required magnetic fields to confine {{high temperature plasma}} by external magnetic coils. In contrast, in tokamaks and <b>reversed</b> <b>field</b> <b>pinches</b> the magnetic <b>field</b> is created by the interaction of external magnets and an electrical current flowing through the plasma. The lack of this large externally driven plasma currents makes stellarators suitable for steady-state fusion power plant.|$|R
25|$|In {{spite of}} ZETA's failure to achieve fusion, the device {{went on to}} have a long {{experimental}} lifetime and produced numerous important advances in the field. In one line of development, the use of lasers to more accurately measure the temperature was developed on ZETA, and was later used to confirm the results of the Soviet tokamak approach. In another, while examining ZETA test runs it was noticed that the plasma self-stabilised after the power was turned off. This has led to the modern <b>reversed</b> <b>field</b> <b>pinch</b> concept. More generally, studies of the instabilities in ZETA have led to several important theoretical advances that form the basis of modern plasma theory.|$|E

50|$|As in {{most such}} {{experiments}} the MST plasma is a toroidal pinch, {{which means the}} plasma is shaped like a donut and confined by a magnetic field generated by a large current flowing through it.

40|$|In {{nearly all}} {{magnetic}} fusion devices the plasma {{is surrounded by}} a conducting shell of some description. In most cases this is the vacuum vessel.

In the present work, boundary integrals of the eddy current along the shell are added to the conventional Cauchy-condition surface method formulation. The eddy current profile is unknown in advance but straightforwardly identified using only the signals from magnetic sensors located outside the plasma. Two ideas are introduced to overcome the numerical difficulties encountered in the problem. One is an accurate boundary integral scheme to damp out the near singularity occurring at the sensor position very close to the shell. The other is the modified truncated singular value decomposition technique to solve an ill-conditioned matrix equation when a large number of nodal points exist on the shell.
