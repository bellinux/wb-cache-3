50|$|As {{the first}} breed of lop rabbit, the English Lop {{was one of}} the first fancy breeds of rabbit {{developed}} in England, in the 19th century for the purposes of exhibition as a response to rise of animal fancy and consequently the rabbit's emergence as a mainstream household pet during the Victorian era, marking a departure from the earlier role of domesticated <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>for</b> meat, fur and wool production. Later, the English Lop was bred with other Continental giant breeds of rabbit gave rise to a number of new breeds of lop rabbit, including the French Lop, which developed from breeding between the English Lop and Flemish Giant, and the Holland Lop, which was in turn developed from the French Lop and the Netherlands Dwarf. it is thought that the English lop got the large ears because in the Algeirs it was hot and with the big ears they kept cool.|$|R
5000|$|While {{under the}} warren system, rabbits were managed and harvested, {{they were not}} domesticated. The {{practice}} of rabbit domestication also came from Rome. Christian monasteries throughout Europe and the Middle East kept rabbits {{since at least the}} 5th century. (Pope Gregory stated in a Papal Edict of the year 600 AD that fetal rabbits were permissible to eat during the Lenten fast, greatly enhancing their popularity, and it is from this date that the true domestication of rabbits is counted.) [...] While rabbits might be allowed to wander freely within the monastery walls, a more common method was the employment of rabbit courts or rabbit pits. A rabbit court was a walled area lined with brick and cement, while a pit was much the same, only less well-lined, and more sunken. [...] Individual boxes or burrow-spaces could line the wall. Rabbits would be kept in a group in these pits or courts, and individuals collected when desired for eating or pelts. From these pits, which did not allow for easy cleaning, ready handling of <b>rabbits,</b> or <b>for</b> selective <b>breeding,</b> <b>rabbit</b> keepers transitioned to individual hutches or pens, which were originally made of wood but are now more frequently made of metal in order to allow for better sanitation.|$|R
40|$|The profit model {{developed}} {{was used}} to investigate and provide insight into two scenarios – the profitability of restricted feeding in grower rabbits and {{the relative importance of}} some selection traits <b>for</b> <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeding.</b> Using published parameters for production levels and cost inputs, the model calculated outputs that were consistent with survey values for the best 25 % of French rabbit breeders. The model demonstrated that restricted feeding of growers, which was introduced in France to help combat epizootic rabbit enterocolitis (ERE), may be a profitable undertaking regardless of the presence of ERE, due to improvement of feed conversion ratio. Under the assumptions used, the relative importance of traits in the breeding objective was highest for production traits, reproduction being the highest then growth, with fitness traits, such as resistance to ERE and longevity, contributing much less to profit. However, relative economic values need to be viewed in the light of associated changes in other traits, and traits such as longevity may indeed have a higher value if used as a de facto trait to select for poor fertility and disease resistance in breeding does...|$|R

All 50 nest sites investigated were grouped into five categories {{according to the}} extent of nestbox use over 5  years (2007 to 2011): (1) nest sites avoided for resting, i.e., nestboxes used for resting in 0 to 1  year; (2) nest sites occasionally used for resting, i.e., nestboxes used for resting in 2 to 3  years; (3) nest sites preferred for resting, i.e., nestboxes used for resting in 4 to 5  years; (4) nest sites used <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> once, i.e., nestboxes used <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> in 1  year (irrespective of the use for resting); and (5) nest sites preferred <b>for</b> <b>breeding,</b> i.e., nestboxes used <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> in 2 to 4  years (irrespective of the use for resting).
