The glycollate pathway inhibitors α-hydroxy- 2 - pyridine – methanesulfonate (HPMS) and isonicotinyl hydrazide (INH) increased glycollate excretion {{rates by}} inhibiting glycollate metabolism. Neither compound affect <b>ribulose</b> <b>biphosphate</b> (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase activity, {{indicating that the}} inhibitors do not influence glycollate metabolism. Neither compound affected <b>ribulose</b> <b>biphosphate</b> (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase activity, indicating that the inhibitors do not influence glycollate formation rates but that glycollate excretion in their presence may be taken as an index of the rate of glycollate production. Previous growth under air or air plus 5 % CO 2 did not influence rates of glycollate production. The excretion of glycollate obtained with C. marina during photosynthesis under normal conditions of growth, is a demonstration that under those glycollate production and metabolism occur in healthy cells.

40|$|Chloroplasts were {{isolated}} from E. gracilis z grown on a vitamin B_ -limiting medium. The procedure is consisted of partial trysin digestion of the Euglena cells, subsequent mechanical {{disruption of the}} cells and collection of Chloroplasts by differential centrifugation. The isolated Chloroplasts fixed CO_ 2 {{at a rate of}} 20 μmoles of CO_ 2 per mg chlorophyll per hr, corresponding to one-third of the photosynthetic activity of the original cells. Linear sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the crude cell homogenate obtained by the digestive method shows that chlorophyll and most of the activity of <b>ribulose</b> <b>biphosphate</b> carboxylase cosediment as only one peak to the fraction corresponding to an equilibrium density of 1. 165 g/cm^ 3. Based on these results we disignate the Chloroplasts isolated by the digestive method as the "intact" chloroplasts...|$|E
40|$|The {{carboxylation}} of <b>ribulose</b> <b>biphosphate</b> by {{the enzyme}} ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase is the mechanism for CO 2 fixation and primary production {{in nearly all}} ecosystems on this planet. Although certain algal isolates and higher plants contain conserved nucleotide sequences in the large subunit of the gene (rbcL) for this enzyme, such genes from natural microbial assemblages have not been heretofore examined. Using oligonucleotide primers designed for conserved regions of the rbcL gene of a Synechococcus sp. (Anacystis nidulans), we have amplified rbcL from DNA preparations from planktonic samples from a Florida reservoir and from algal isolates by the polymerase chain reaction. We have also detected rbcL by gene amplification in the extracellular DNA fraction of this reservoir, indicating that phytoplankton can {{be a source of}} dissolved DNA. These results suggest that gene amplification can be applied for the detection of conserved genes encoding enzymes involved in important ecological functions in aquatic environments...|$|E
40|$|For {{the strong}} {{expression}} of genes in plant tissue, {{the availability of}} specific gene regulatory sequences is desired. We cloned promoter and terminator sequences of an apple (Malus x domestica) <b>ribulose</b> <b>biphosphate</b> carboxylase small subunit gene (MdRbcS), which {{is known for its}} high expression and used gus reporter gene expression to test the regulatory activity of the isolated promoter and terminator sequences in transgenic tobacco. The MdRbcS promoter itself seemed to be less strong than the CaMV 35 S promoter when both used in combination with the nos terminator. However, the combination of the promoter and terminator of MdRbcS was able to drive gus to similar expression levels as the reference construct with CaMV 35 S promoter and nos terminator. This observation indicates the importance of the terminator sequence for gene expression. It is concluded that the combination of the MdRbcS promoter and terminator is a suitable regulatory sequence set for the expression of transgenes to a high level in plants and for intragenesis in apple specificall...|$|E
40|$|Enclosing {{seawater}} {{samples in}} incubation bottles had 3 main {{effects on the}} phytoplankton: first, a large (5 -fold in 12 h) increase of phytoplankton biomass, due {{to the release of}} grazing pressure by herbivores, Second, an increase (2 -fold in 6 h) in <b>ribulose</b> <b>biphosphate</b> carboxylase specific activity (per unit chlorophyll a), which could be due to a smaller dependence on regenerated production (less heterotrophy on excreted compounds). This was also supported by a tight relationship between phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase activity and dissolved ammonium. Finally, the large changes in the carbon isotopic composition of the incubated particulate matter, which were highly dependent on the dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration, were due mainly to physiological processes such as biochemical fractionation rather than physical processes such as CO 2 limitation. For environments with high phytoplankton growth rate and high grazing pressure, a duration of incubation greater than 3 h may significantly change the physiology of the organisms and lead to different estimates of carbon assimilation by autotrophs than bulk water estimates...|$|E
40|$|Chlorophyll {{fluorescence}} induction curves {{have been}} used as a sensitive tool for screening the photosynthetic performance of plants. Experimental treatments involving nitrate supply and chilling stress have been shown to affect fluorescence induction curves and other measures of photosynthesis. We have investigated the photosynthetic performance of Sorghum bicolor supplied with Long Ashton growth solution containing standard (20 μmol mol^(– 1)) or low (5 μmol mol^(– 1)) phosphorus. The JIP-test based on the chlorophyll fluorescence induction curve was used as a non-destructive method to measure the relative proportions of energy dissipated by different processes (termed energy fluxes) in the light reactions. The various energy fluxes or derived parameters were compared to find the measures that were most sensitive to the experimental conditions. Plant response to treatments was first evident in selected chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, particularly performance index (PI_ABS_); plants with increased PI_ABS_ manifested higher electron transport activity and dissipated less energy as heat, possibly {{as a result of their}} better phosphorus status, leading to more functional reaction centres. Observed changes in fluorescence were correlated to changes in gas exchange and biomass. Standard phosphorus treatments significantly increased biomass, leaf area, photosynthetic and respiratory rates, carboxylation efficiencies and levels of <b>ribulose</b> <b>biphosphate</b> regeneration rates, relative to plants with low supplies of nutrients...|$|E
40|$|The {{genes for}} the large and small {{subunits}} of <b>ribulose</b> <b>biphosphate</b> carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) from Anacystis nidulans have been expressed in Escherichia coli {{under the control of}} the lac promoter to produce active enzyme. The enzyme can be purified from the cells to yield up to 200 mg Rubisco/l cultured bacteria, and is indistinguishable from the enzyme extracted from A. nidulans. In order to investigate the role of the N-terminus of the large subunit in catalysis, chimaeric genes were constructed where the DNA coding for the 12 N-terminal amino acids in A. nidulans was replaced by DNA encoding the equivalent, but poorly conserve, region of either the wheat or maize large subunit. These genes, in constructs also containing the gene for the A. nidulans small subunit, were expressed in E. coli and produced enzymes with similar catalytic properties to the wild-type Rubisco of A. nidulans. In contrast, when the N-terminal region of the large subunit was replaced by unrelated amino acids encoded by the pUC 8 polylinker, enzyme activity of the expressed protein was reduced by 90 % under standard assay conditions, due to an approximately tenfold rise in the K(m) for ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate. This confirms that the N-terminus of the large subunit has a function in catalysis, either directly in substrate binding or in maintaining the integrity of the active site...|$|E
40|$|Iron (Fe) {{is one of}} {{the vital}} {{limiting}} factors for phytoplankton in vast regions of the contemporary oceans, notably the high nutrient low chlorophyll regions. Therefore, it is apparent to be acquainted with the Fe uptake strategy of marine phytoplankton under Fe-limited condition. In the present study, marine phytoplankton Prymnesium parvum was grown under Fe-deplete (0. 0025 μM) and Fe-rich (0. 05 μM) conditions, and proteomic responses of the organism to Fe conditions were compared. In sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis, 7 proteins (16, 18, 32, 34, 75, 82, and 116 kDa) were highly expressed under Fe-deplete condition, while one protein (23 kDa) was highly expressed under Fe-rich condition. These proteins were subjected to 2 -dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -D DIGE) to differentiate individual proteins, and were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis. The results showed that under Fe-deplete condition P. parvum increases the biosynthesis of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, flagellar associated protein (FAP), and Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase. These proteins are assumed to be involved in a number of cellular biochemical processes that facilitate Fe acquisition in phytoplankton. Under Fe-deplete condition, P. parvum increases the synthesis of <b>ribulose</b> <b>biphosphate</b> carboxylase (RuBisCo), malate dehydrogenase, and two Fe-independent oxidative stress response proteins, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and Serine threonine kinase (STK). Thus, marine phytoplankton may change their Fe acquisition strategy by altering the biosynthesis of several proteins in order to cope with Fe-limitation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A set of {{proteins}} that changed {{their levels of}} synthesis during growth of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 19859 on metal sulfides, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, and ferrous iron was characterized by using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis of these proteins allowed their identification and the localization of the corresponding genes in the available genomic sequence of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270. The genomic context around several of these genes suggests their involvement in the energetic metabolism of A. ferrooxidans. Two groups {{of proteins}} could be distinguished. The first consisted of proteins highly upregulated by growth on sulfur compounds (and downregulated by growth on ferrous iron) : a 44 -kDa outer membrane protein, an exported 21 -kDa putative thiosulfate sulfur transferase protein, a 33 -kDa putative thiosulfate/sulfate binding protein, a 45 -kDa putative capsule polysaccharide export protein, and a putative 16 -kDa protein of unknown function. The second group of proteins comprised those downregulated by growth on sulfur (and upregulated by growth on ferrous iron) : rusticyanin, a cytochrome c 552, a putative phosphate binding protein (PstS), the small and large subunits of <b>ribulose</b> <b>biphosphate</b> carboxylase, and a 30 -kDa putative CbbQ protein, among others. The results suggest in general a separation of the iron and sulfur utilization pathways. Rusticyanin, {{in addition to being}} highly expressed on ferrous iron, was also newly synthesized, as determined by metabolic labeling, although at lower levels, during growth on sulfur compounds and iron-free metal sulfides. During growth on metal sulfides containing iron, such as pyrite and chalcopyrite, both proteins upregulated on ferrous iron and those upregulated on sulfur compounds were synthesized, indicating that the two energy-generating pathways are induced simultaneously depending on the kind and concentration of oxidizable substrates available...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1993. Microfiche. x, 131 leaves, bound 29 cmThe {{ability of}} marine {{phytoplankton}} to acclimate to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) was examined. Monocultures of a subtropical diatom, Chaetoceros gracilis, were maintained under photosynthetically available radiation (PAR-only) and PAR plus UVR (PAR+UVR) for a 48 h exposure period. Growth rates, pigment concentrations, carbon fixation capability, variable fluorescence, and activity of 1, 5 <b>ribulose</b> <b>biphosphate</b> oxygenase/carboxylase (Rubisco) were initially reduced by UVR. By 24 h, {{and for the}} remainder of the 48 h exposure period, growth rate, pigment concentrations, Rubisco activity and carbon fixation capability were not affected by PAR+UVR. After 48 h of UVR exposure, (acclimation assumed complete), turnover rates of the putative D 1 protein of photosystem II (PSII) and Chlorophyll (Chl) a were higher than controls, suggesting continual damage by UVR. Maximum rate of oxygen evolution and the efficiency of PSII increased following acclimation to UVR. The maximum rate of carbon fixation was not affected on a per cell basis and decreased on a per Chl a basis following UVR acclimation. Chlorophyll a specific photosynthesis over a 5 h exposure period was equal between the two acclimation treatments (PAR-only and PAR+UV). Transfer of PAR-only acclimated cells to PAR+UVR for the same 5 h period lead to a reduction in Chl a specific photosynthesis, indicating acute inhibition of photosynthesis by UVR. Chlorophyll a specific photosynthesis of cells acclimated to PAR+UVR and transferred to PAR-only was 24 % higher than cells maintained in PAR+UVR during the determination of photosynthesis, indicating enhancement of productivity following the removal of UVR. Effect of ambient subtropical UVR on natural phytoplankton populations was examined. Natural phytoplankton assemblages from Kane'ohe Bay, Hawai'i were maintained for ten days at ambient temperature and nutrient levels. Rates of primary production by assemblages exposed to PAR-only and PAR+UVR were equal. Assemblages acclimated to PAR+UVR and then transferred to PAR-only fixed 67 % more carbon per Chl a than assemblages acclimated to PAR+UVR and maintained in PAR+UVR. Acclimation to ambient PAR+UVR resulted in a 171 % increase in Chl a concentration compared to assemblages maintained under PAR-only conditions...|$|E
40|$|Paracoccus denitrificans {{is able to}} grow on the C 1 {{compounds}} methanol and methylamine. These compounds are oxidized to formaldehyde {{which is}} subsequently oxidized via formate to carbon dioxide. Biomass is produced by carbon dioxide fixation via the <b>ribulose</b> <b>biphosphate</b> pathway. The first oxidation reaction is catalyzed by the enzymes methanol dehydrogenase and methylamine dehydrogenase, respectively. Both enzymes contain two different subunits in an alpha 2 beta 2 configuration. The genes encoding the subunits of methanol dehydrogenase (moxF and moxI) have been isolated and sequenced. They are located in one operon together with two other genes (moxJ and moxG) in the gene order moxFJGI. The function of the moxJ gene product is not yet known. MoxG codes for a cytochrome c 551 i, which functions as the electron acceptor of methanol dehydrogenase. Both methanol dehydrogenase and methylamine dehydrogenase contain PQQ as a cofactor. These so-called quinoproteins are able to catalyze redox reactions by one-electron steps. The reaction mechanism of this oxidation will be described. Electrons from the oxidation reaction are donated to the electron transport chain {{at the level of}} cytochrome c. P. denitrificans is able to synthesize at least 10 different c-type cytochromes. Five could be detected in the periplasm and five have been found in the cytoplasmic membrane. The membrane-bound cytochrome c 1 and cytochrome c 552 and the periplasmic-located cytochrome c 550 are present under all tested growth conditions. The cytochromes c 551 i and c 553 i, present in the periplasm, are only induced in cells grown on methanol, methylamine, or choline. The other c-type cytochromes are mainly detected either under oxygen limited conditions or under anaerobic conditions with nitrate as electron acceptor or under both conditions. An overview including the induction pattern of all P. denitrificans c-type cytochromes will be given. The genes encoding cytochrome c 1, cytochrome c 550, cytochrome c 551 i, and cytochrome c 553 i have been isolated and sequenced. By using site-directed mutagenesis these genes were mutated in the genome. The mutants thus obtained were used to study electron transport during growth on C 1 compounds. This electron transport has also been studied by determining electron transfer rates in in vitro experiments. The exact pathways, however, are not yet fully understood. Electrons from methanol dehydrogenase are donated to cytochrome c 551 i. Further electron transport is either via cytochrome c 550 or cytochrome c 553 i to cytochrome aa 3. However, direct electron transport from cytochrome c 551 i to the terminal oxidase might be possible as well. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
