5|$|A 2007 <b>report</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{about one-third}} of District {{residents}} were functionally illiterate, compared to a national rate of about one in five. This is attributed in part to immigrants who are not proficient in English. , 85% of D.C. residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language. Half of residents had at least a four-year college degree in 2006. D.C. residents had a personal income per capita of $55,755; higher {{than any of the}} 50 states. However, 19% of residents were below the poverty level in 2005, higher than any state except Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|A report {{into the}} {{experience}} of refugees resettled in Brighton and Hove under the scheme between October 2006 and October 2007 was published by the Sussex Centre for Migration Research at the University of Sussex in December 2007. The <b>report</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the refugees had struggled to gain employment and English language skills. Another evaluation report undertaken for the Home Office and published in 2011 also found that only small numbers of resettled refugees were in paid employment, noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their basic needs.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent care facilities. Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The <b>report</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency room visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to growing}} {{concerns}} in the public, in 2001 the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health asked the U.S. National Academy of Science's (NAS) Institute of Medicine to establish an independent expert committee to review hypotheses about existing and emerging immunization safety concerns. This initial <b>report</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> based on indirect and incomplete evidence available at the time, there was inadequate evidence to accept or reject a thiomersal-autism link, though it was biologically plausible.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} ACA nonprofit {{insurance}} cooperatives for 2017 fell from 23 originally to 7 for 2017. The remaining 7 posted annual losses in 2015.

5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review panel {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The <b>report</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident. Instead, the contributing factors were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the circuit. The report also made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that {{it would not have been}} possible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes to the cockpit design. The report also revealed that the fail-safe for the car's brake-by-wire system had failed. Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Walter Chrysler had {{a two-story}} {{apartment}} on the 69th and 70th floors with a fireplace and a private office. The office also contained a gymnasium and the tallest bathrooms in the world. Chrysler also had a triplex unit on the 58th through 60th floors, which served as his residence. However, Chrysler did not use his gym much, instead choosing {{to stay at the}} Chrysler Corporation's headquarters in Detroit. Later, the 69th and 70th floors were converted into a dental clinic. In 2005, a New York Times <b>report</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> one of the dentists, Charles Weiss, had operated at the clinic's current rooftop location since 1969. The office still had the suite's original bathroom and gymnasium.|$|E
5|$|The 1920 Republican National Convention {{opened at}} the Chicago Coliseum on June 8, 1920, {{assembling}} delegates who were bitterly divided, most recently over {{the results of a}} Senate investigation into campaign spending, which had just been released. That <b>report</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Wood had spent $1.8 million, lending substance to Johnson's claims that Wood was trying to buy the presidency. Some of the $600,000 that Lowden had spent had wound up in the pockets of two convention delegates. Johnson had spent $194,000 and Harding $113,000. Johnson was deemed to be behind the inquiry, and the rage of the Lowden and Wood factions put an end to any possible compromise among the frontrunners. Of the almost 1,000 delegates, 27 were women—the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing women the vote, was within one state of ratification, and would pass before the end of August. The convention had no boss, most uninstructed delegates voted as they pleased, and with a Democrat in the White House, the party's leaders could not use patronage to get their way.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, the Cameroon {{government}} passed Act No. 90/035 {{to prohibit}} birth control education. <b>Reports</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> abortion and secretive reproductive health services were widespread {{and made up}} 40 percent of OB/GYN emergency admissions.

50|$|A 2014 {{paper by}} Harvey Whitehouse {{discusses}} theories that hazing can cause social cohesion though group identification and identity fusion. A 2017 {{study published in}} Scientific <b>Reports</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> groups that share painful or strong negative experiences can cause visceral bonding, and pro-group behavior. Students of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu who had experienced painful belt-whipping gauntlets had a higher willingness to donate time or risk their lives for the club.|$|R
50|$|In December 2012, Motor Trend {{reported}} that Consumer Reports and Green Car <b>Reports</b> have <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the 2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid and 2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid, which {{share the same}} powertrain, do not deliver their triple 47 mpg EPA ratings in real-world use. After running both vehicles through Consumer Reports real-world tests, the magazine <b>found</b> <b>that</b> C-Max hybrid achieved a combined fuel economy average of 37 mpg, with 35 mpg and 38 mpg for city and highway. Green Car <b>Reports</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the C-Max delivered 37 mpg over 50 mi of mixed freeway and urban driving, and 40 mpg over 240 mi mostly at freeway speeds.|$|R
5|$|The <b>report</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the {{tendency}} of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and {{that it did not}} explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that {{were not included in the}} broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.|$|E
