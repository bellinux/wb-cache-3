Stephen took the castle after several attempts in 1139, famously rescuing his ally Prince Henry of Scotland when the latter was caught on a hook thrown over the walls by the garrison. Gilbert still maintained {{that he was the}} <b>rightful</b> <b>owner</b> of Ludlow, however, and a private war ensued between Joce and himself.

25|$|The Keys to the Kingdom {{are seven}} objects of power {{given to the}} Trustees along with command over their demesnes. It is unknown whether, but implied that, control of the Key is that which gives one control over a demesne and its namesake day in the Secondary Realms. The Key will bond to the <b>rightful</b> <b>owner</b> of a Key, and protect him or her from harm, {{somewhat}} from pain but not at all from discomfort. A <b>rightful</b> <b>owner</b> of a Key is an Heir, the Trustee to whom it was originally entrusted, or a Steward. Over time, {{the use of a}} Key will irreparably turn a mortal into a Denizen, though it is mentioned that after a few centuries, this process may reverse a little. Because the presence of a Denizen in the Secondary Realms is inimical to mortal life, Arthur attempted to use the Keys as little as possible, as he wishes to remain mortal and return to his family; however, he later realizes that without the keys he would not be alive, and used the powers to protect the Lower House and his home town.|$|E
