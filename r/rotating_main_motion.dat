The periodic solution of system was analyzed by continuation-shooting algorithm for periodic solution of nonlinear non-autonomous system, and {{the stability of}} system periodic motion and unsteady law are discussed by Floquet theory. The unstable form of it is Hopf bifurcation. In the region of critical <b>rotate</b> speed, the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> {{of the system is}} periodic- 4; and it of ultra critical <b>rotate</b> speed, the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> of the system is periodic- 3 and chaotic motion. The conclusions provide theoretic basis reference for the fault diagnosis of the rotor-bearing system...|$|R
50|$|A <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> is {{a motion}} that brings {{business}} before the assembly. <b>Main</b> <b>motions</b> are made while no other motion is pending. Any of the subsidiary, incidental and privileged motions {{may be made}} while the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> is pending, {{and in many cases}} these motions, if passed, will affect the assemblys consideration of the <b>main</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Because {{debate on}} the motion to {{postpone}} indefinitely may go into {{the merits of the}} pending <b>main</b> <b>motion,</b> it may provide members of the assembly with additional opportunities to debate the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> beyond the number of speeches normally permitted by the rules. [...] It can also be used by opponents of a <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> to test whether they have the votes needed to defeat the <b>main</b> <b>motion,</b> without risking a direct vote. [...] If the motion to postpone indefinitely is defeated, direct consideration of the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> is resumed, and opponents of the motion may then determine whether to continue in their effort to defeat the <b>main</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|R
50|$|Normally, this is {{a motion}} that {{introduces}} a substantive question as a new subject, in which case it is also called an original <b>main</b> <b>motion.</b> Otherwise, it is an incidental <b>main</b> <b>motion,</b> examples of which are the motions to adopt recommendations of a committee, to ratify action previously taken without a quorum, to rescind an action previously taken, or to adjourn or recess while no <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> is pending. Unlike original <b>main</b> <b>motions,</b> incidental <b>main</b> <b>motions</b> cannot have an objection to the consideration of the question applied to them.|$|R
50|$|Postpone indefinitely—to end {{consideration}} of the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> for the balance of that session, without a direct vote on the <b>main</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{subsidiary}} {{motion is}} a type of motion by which a deliberative assembly deals directly with a <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> prior to (or instead of) voting on the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> itself. Each subsidiary motion ranks higher than the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> and lower than the privileged motions, and also yields to applicable incidental motions. Some of the subsidiary motions may also be applied to certain other subsidiary motions, incidental motions and privileged motions.|$|R
5000|$|The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure has {{a motion}} to table. It can {{temporarily}} set aside a <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> (in which case it is also called the motion to postpone temporarily, a motion not in RONR) or it can kill the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> without a direct vote or further debate. TSC uses the short form, [...] "table", which is discouraged by RONR. If the motion to table is used in circumstances suggesting that {{the purpose is to}} kill the <b>main</b> <b>motion,</b> a two-thirds vote should be required.|$|R
5000|$|Subsidiary motions, which {{affect the}} <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> being considered.|$|R
50|$|Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised {{does not}} have such a motion. However, the same effect could be done by having the maker of a <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> request to {{withdraw}} it. If the assembly approves this request, all adhering <b>motions</b> to the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> cease to be before the assembly as well.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "main motion" [...] {{refers to}} the primary {{question}} before the assembly; in Congressional Debate, this is the legislation as presented on the agenda, so it is never necessary for a contestant to specifically move the <b>main</b> <b>motion.</b> <b>Main</b> <b>motions</b> can be changed or affected {{by a variety of}} subsidiary motions.|$|R
50|$|The date {{to which}} the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> is being {{postponed}} is not too late {{for it to be}} effective. For example, if the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> proposes that there be a picnic on September 3, the motion cannot be postponed to September 5, because that would be too late for it to be carried out.|$|R
50|$|Amend—to {{change the}} <b>main</b> <b>motion.</b> (May also {{be applied to}} certain other motions).|$|R
50|$|A {{proposed}} {{amendment is}} treated {{like many other}} motions in {{that it could be}} debated and voted on. This could be done even {{in the case of a}} friendly amendment. An amendment could pass with a majority vote, regardless of the vote required to pass the <b>main</b> <b>motion.</b> After passing or rejecting an amendment, the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> would still need to be voted on.|$|R
50|$|Commit or Refer—to {{send the}} <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> and any pending {{subsidiary}} motions to a committee for consideration.|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{a motion}} to {{postpone}} is applied to a <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> and not to other motions alone.|$|R
50|$|If the {{substitute}} amendment passed, the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> as amended would {{still need to}} be voted on.|$|R
50|$|An {{incidental}} {{motion is}} a motion that relates in varying ways to the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> and other parliamentary motions.|$|R
50|$|If a <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> is withdrawn, all {{adhering}} motions (such as amendments) are {{no longer}} before the body as well.|$|R
5000|$|A {{motion to}} adjourn is a privileged motion, {{unless it is}} {{qualified}} in any way (such as [...] "adjourn at 10 p.m."), the time for adjourning is already established, or unless adjournment would dissolve the assembly (in these cases, it is a <b>main</b> <b>motion).</b> The privileged motion to adjourn is used to end the meeting immediately without debate. If it is a <b>main</b> <b>motion,</b> it cannot interrupt pending business, and is amendable and debatable.|$|R
5000|$|Under Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (the book used by most organizations), the {{subsidiary}} {{motion to}} lay {{on the table is}} properly used only when it is necessary to suspend consideration of a <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> {{in order to deal with}} another matter that has come up unexpectedly and which must be dealt with before the pending motion can be properly addressed. It has, however, become common to misuse this motion to end consideration of the pending <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> without debate, or to mistakenly assume that its adoption prevents further consideration of the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> at all, or until a specified time. Using [...] "table" [...] as a verb usually indicates misuse of this motion. The book states, [...] "It is preferable to avoid moving 'to table' a motion, or 'that the <b>motion</b> be tabled.'"A <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> that has been laid on the table may be taken up again by adoption of a motion to take from the table. A motion can be taken from the table at the same session (or meeting) or at the next session (or meeting) if that session occurs within a quarterly time interval. Otherwise, the motion dies.|$|R

50|$|Lay on the Table—to suspend {{consideration}} of the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> and any pending subsidiary motions to allow for immediate {{consideration of}} more urgent business.|$|R
50|$|Any {{proposed}} {{amendments to}} the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> that are pending {{at the time the}} motion is referred to a committee go to the committee as well.|$|R

50|$|Using {{the rules}} in RONR, a <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> is {{improperly}} killed by tabling it. In this case, before debate has begun, {{it would have been}} proper to make an objection to the consideration of the question.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "previous question" [...] was {{initially}} {{used in the}} British Parliament in 1604. At that time, use of this motion was intended not to end debate, but to suppress the main question {{for the rest of}} the session (similar to an objection to the consideration of a question). It could be debated and when put to a vote, an affirmative vote on the previous question would put the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> to a vote, while a negative vote on the previous question would end consideration of the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> altogether for the day. Although rarely used, this same form of the motion still exists in parliament.|$|R
