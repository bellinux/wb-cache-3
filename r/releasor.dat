5000|$|A legal {{release is}} a legal {{instrument}} that acts to terminate any legal liability between the <b>releasor</b> and the releasee(s), signed by the <b>releasor.</b> A release may also be made orally in some circumstances. Releases are routinely used by photographers, in film production, by documentary filmmakers, or by radio and music producers when they photograph, film, video or record the voice or performance of individuals {{to be sure that}} the person consents or will not later object to the material being used for whatever purpose the release (or anyone they may assign the release rights to) wishes, i.e. that the [...] wishes to use the images, sounds or any other rendering that is a result of the recording made of the <b>releasor</b> (or property owned by the <b>releasor</b> for which the <b>releasor</b> may claim some other right such as industrial design rights, trademark or trade dress rights). This will help in insuring the copyright owner has a clean chain of title for any work if it is later published, broadcast, shown in a public cinema or otherwise made public.|$|E
50|$|Releases {{should be}} drafted by a lawyer, {{solicitor}} or {{civil law notary}} (not in the United States), except perhaps in the most routine of situations; if the release is not correctly drafted or does not recite any necessary limitations the releasee may find out later that the release did not cover all circumstances, and the <b>releasor</b> may find that the release was too general and released some claim, right or entitlement that the <b>releasor</b> should have retained.|$|E
50|$|For {{good and}} {{valuable}} consideration, {{the receipt of}} which is hereby acknowledged, I, the <b>releasor,</b> release the releasee for any and all claims I may have against the releasee up to {{the date of the}} signing of this release to or arising from _____________.|$|E
50|$|Releases {{are very}} {{often used to}} ensure that {{litigation}} is terminated when a settlement or compromise between the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s) is reached. A general release may release any claims known or unknown that the <b>releasor</b> may have against the releasee. The release may also be very specific, i.e. dealing with specific acts between the parties and not applying to any other acts.|$|E
50|$|The {{child must}} be taught to use the toilet {{regularly}} to retrain his/her body. It is usually recommended that a child be required {{to sit on the}} toilet at a regular time each day and 'try' to go for 10-15 minutes, usually soon (or immediately) after eating. Children {{are more likely to be}} able to expel a bowel movement right after eating. It is thought that creating a regular schedule of bathroom time will allow the child to achieve a proper elimination pattern. Repeated voiding success on the toilet itself helps it become a <b>releasor</b> stimulus for successful bowel movements.|$|E
5000|$|On 25 November 1941, Turner {{drafted a}} {{despatch}} to the Commander in Chief of the Asiatic Fleet for release by the CNO, which contained the words: [...] "I consider it probable that this next Japanese aggression may cause {{an outbreak of}} hostilities between the U.S. and Japan." [...] Admiral Stark took this message to the President -- who changed the <b>releasor</b> to himself -- and softened the judgment words [...] "probable" [...] to [...] "possible" [...] and [...] "may" [...] to [...] "might," [...] and he added the bad guess: [...] "Advance against Thailand seems the most probable." ...|$|E
5000|$|Eaton vs. Boston, Concord & Montreal Railroad (B., C. & M.R.R.) was a New Hampshire Supreme Court case {{decided in}} 1872 between farmer Ezra B. Eaton and the {{railroad}} company. Eaton {{asked the court}} to decide if B., C. & M.R.R. flooding of his farm was considered a [...] "taking" [...] under the Fifth Amendment's eminent domain clause, and if the railroad was responsible for compensation to the farmer for the taking. The court asked if [...] "a release of all damages on account of the laying out or construction of a railroad through and over the land of the <b>releasor,</b> does not cover damages occasioned to the remaining land of the <b>releasor</b> by the construction of the railroad over the land of other persons". In 1851, after construction of the railroad, Eaton gave the defendants a warranty deed for the part of his farm where the railroad was located and signed the following release: [...] "I, the subscriber, do hereby acknowledge that I have received of the Boston, Concord, & Montreal Railroad the sum of two hundred and seventy-five dollars, in full for the amount of damages assessed to me by the railroad commissioners of the State of New Hampshire, in conjunction with the selectmen of Wentworth, on account of the laying out of the said Boston, Concord, & Montreal Railroad through and over my land; and I do hereby release and discharge the said corporation from said damages".|$|E
40|$|Oxytocin induces mating {{behavior}} in rats of both sexes. Previous experiments revealed that progesterone-induced sex {{behavior in}} ovariectomized, estrogen-primed rats {{was caused by}} release of NO from NOergic neurons that stimulated the release of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). The LHRH activated brain-stem neurons that initiated the lordosis reflex. We hypothesized that oxytocin might similarly release NO in the medial basal hypothalamic region that would stimulate release of LHRH into the hypophyseal portal vessels to release luteinizing hormone. To investigate this hypothesis, medial basal hypothalamic explants were preincubated in Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 30 min, followed by a 30 -min incubation in fresh Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing the compounds to be tested. Oxytocin stimulated LHRH release 3 - to 4 -fold at the lowest concentration tested (10 − 10 M). Values remained at a plateau as the concentration was increased to 10 − 7 M and then declined in a concentration-dependent manner, {{so that there was}} no stimulation with a concentration of 10 − 5 M. Oxytocin (10 − 7 M) stimulated release of prostaglandin E 2 into the medium, a finding consistent with a role of NO in the response. That NO indeed mediated the action of oxytocin was supported by blockade of the action of oxytocin by the competitive inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (300 μM). Furthermore, oxytocin (10 − 9 to 10 − 7 M) activated NOS as measured {{at the end of the}} experiments. Oxytocin appeared to act to stimulate norepinephrine terminals in the medial basal hypothalamus, which activated NOS by α 1 -adrenergic receptors, because prazocine, an α 1 receptor blocker, inhibited the LHRH-releasing action of oxytocin. Finally, incubation of neural lobe explants with sodium nitroprusside, a NO <b>releasor,</b> revealed that nitroprusside (300 – 600 μM, but not 900 μM) inhibited oxytocin release. Therefore, the NO released by oxytocin also diffuses into the oxytocin neuronal endings and inhibits oxytocin release, forming a negative feedback loop. The results indicate that oxytocin is important not only in induction of mating, but also in stimulating LHRH release with subsequent luteinizing hormone discharge that plays a crucial role in reproduction...|$|E
