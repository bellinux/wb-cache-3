And that is a theme that <b>resonates</b> <b>with</b> me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E

The sixth, yellow jade, is something of a mystery, in that it should not exist and only comes about through alchemical mistakes. Jade weapons are unnaturally fast, and jade armor doesn't tire the wearer.|$|E

25|$|What makes Tipling's {{photographic}} work distinctive is {{his artistic}} sense of composition. His work {{is influenced by}} the Swedish painter Bruno Liljefors whose often brooding depictions of predator-prey action – the hunts engaged between sea eagle and eider, goshawk and black grouse – help to create their darkly primitive atmosphere. and by Robert Gillmor's strong graphic,. Tipling cites some of the great Eastern painters who practised Oriental ink painting which has its roots in calligraphy, as influential. Much of his work <b>resonates</b> <b>with</b> that sense of proportion achieved in the light, striking shapes of Xu Wei's work.|$|E
25|$|According to Mahabharata epic, the God {{of death}} {{took the form}} of a woman and resides {{on the banks of the}} river to limit {{population}} growth. Kosi <b>resonates</b> <b>with</b> the folklore of Mithila. The most important depictions of Kosi folklore are Kosi as a virgin absolutely care free and full of energy and as a frustrated wife of old hermit Richeek wandering in the Himalayas. Kosi is also invoked as the mother - 'Kosi Ma'. These images capture the contradiction that is inherent in the Kosi River as a source of life and death, prosperity and destruction; a mother and an enchanting virgin.|$|E
25|$|The musical {{genre of}} Namdev's {{literary}} works {{was a form}} of Prabandha – itself a very large and rich genre that includes dhrupad, thumri, tappa, geet, bhajan and other species. In some species of Indian music, it is the music that dominates while words and their meaning are secondary. In contrast, in Namdev's bhajan the spiritual message in the words has a central role, and the structure <b>resonates</b> <b>with</b> the singing and music. The songs and music that went with Namdev's works, were usually transmitted verbally across generations, in a guru-sisya-parampara (teacher-student tradition), within singing gharanas (family-like musical units).|$|E

Each material {{is associated with a}} type of Exalted, as well as one of the castes of Alchemical Exalted, who are partially constructed from that material. These materials are all easily enchanted, and each one <b>resonates</b> <b>with</b> a particular type of Exalted. This resonance makes any item that is both constructed from one of the magical materials and attuned to an Exalt's anima preternaturally deft and sure in that Exalt's hands. It also gives the Exalt access to the powers of any hearthstone mounted on the item.|$|E

25|$|Based on the {{analysis}} above, {{it is not}} hard to conclude that the threat of revolution constantly incentivizes the rich to democratize. The theory also <b>resonates</b> <b>with</b> Clark, Golder and Golder's paper Power and Politics: Insights from an Exist, Voice and Loyalty Game, in which the government decides between predate and not to predate citizens based on the payoff while the citizen has the option to exit (migrate to other countries), remain loyal and voice their concerns at a cost (protest). Similarly, this game also provides insights into how variables like exit payoff, cost of voicing and value of loyalty change state's behavior as to whether or not to predate.|$|E

25|$|On {{the way to}} Helm's Deep, the {{refugees}} from Edoras are attacked by Wargs. The scene is possibly inspired by one in the book cut from The Fellowship of the Ring where it is the Fellowship who battle them. Here, a new subplot is created where Aragorn falls over a cliff, and {{is assumed to be}} dead; Jackson added it to create tension. This scene also <b>resonates</b> <b>with</b> a new subplot regarding Arwen, where she decides to leave Middle-earth after losing hope in the long-term possibilities of her love. In the book, Arwen's role is primarily recorded in the Appendices, and she is never depicted as considering such an act.|$|E
25|$|Recent radiologic appraisals of the {{mesenteric}} organ {{have been}} conducted {{in the context of}} the contemporary understanding of mesenteric organ anatomy. When this organ is divided into non-flexural and flexural regions, these can readily be differentiated in most patients on CT imaging. Clarification of the radiological appearance of the human mesentery <b>resonates</b> <b>with</b> the suggestions of Dodd and enables a clearer conceptualization of mesenteric derangements in disease states. This is of immediate relevance in the spread of cancer from colon cancer and perforated diverticular disease, and in pancreatitis where fluid collections in the lesser sac dissect the mesocolon from the retroperitoneum and thereby extend distally within the latter.|$|E
25|$|The Sanskrit {{version of}} the Panchatantra text gives names to the animal characters, but these names are {{creative}} with double meanings. The names connote the character observable in nature but also map a human personality that a reader can readily identify. For example, the deer characters are presented {{as a metaphor for}} charming, innocent, peaceful and tranquil personality who is a target for those who seek a prey to exploit, while crocodiles are presented as a symbolism for those with dangerous intent hiding beneath welcoming ambiance (waters of a lotus flower-laden pond). Dozens of different types of wildlife found in India are thus named, and they constitute an array of symbolic characters in the Panchatantra. Thus, the names of the animals evoke layered meaning that <b>resonates</b> <b>with</b> the reader, and the same story can be read at different levels.|$|E

25|$|The poem {{is written}} in the first person, and is the soliloquy {{of a young woman}} contemplating life and death, {{engagement}} and withdrawal, love and estrangement, in a setting dominated by the sea, the sky, stars, rocky cliffs, and the rising sun. However, it is also possible to read the poem as an allegory on the way fate moves human affairs or as an attempt to comprehend the horrific violence in Europe {{at the time of the}} poem's composition. The poem is not about World War I, but it does try to address the relationships between destruction and beauty, and, in this sense, it <b>resonates</b> <b>with</b> ancient Greek meditations on these matters, especially in the plays of Sophocles and Aeschylus. There are, therefore, evident links with le Cimetière marin, which is also a seaside meditation on comparably large themes.|$|E
25|$|The {{specialized}} transformer {{used in the}} Tesla coil circuit, {{called a}} resonant transformer, oscillation transformer or radio-frequency (RF) transformer, functions differently from an ordinary transformer used in AC power circuits. While an ordinary transformer is designed to transfer energy efficiently from primary to secondary winding, the resonant transformer is also designed to temporarily store electrical energy. Each winding has a capacitance across it and functions as an LC circuit (resonant circuit, tuned circuit), storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to a tuning fork. The primary coil (L1) consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a capacitor (C1) through the spark gap (SG). The secondary coil (L2) consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of fine wire on a hollow cylindrical form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an LC circuit, the inductance of (L2) <b>resonates</b> <b>with</b> stray capacitance (C2), {{the sum of the}} stray parasitic capacitance between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the toroidal metal electrode attached to the high voltage terminal. The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, they have the same resonant frequency. This allows them to exchange energy, so the oscillating current alternates {{back and forth between the}} primary and secondary coils.|$|E
