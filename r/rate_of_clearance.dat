50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, LDV has a {{very high}} specificity. Studies have shown that LDV is not only host specific, but cell specific as well. The first cells it was shown to replicate in were primary mouse embryo cell cultures, but these cultures had to be freshly explanted. After about seven days the cells lost their ability to support LDV even though they could support other viruses. When other mouse tissues were tested {{it was found that}} peritoneal macrophages consistently yielded the highest virus titers. Further studies have shown that in the first twenty-four hours after infection of a macrophage there is very rapid virus replication; this rate gradually falls off to a very low level but continues as long as the macrophage continues to divide. The viremia arises because LDV lyses the cell after replication. The virus is most commonly found in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and skin. The main effect of the virus on the host cell is to increase the activity of certain plasma enzymes; this increase in activity is not directly related to the level of viral infectivity, but does depend on the balance between rate of entry and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> and evidence leans more heavily towards the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>clearance.</b> In the plasma, LDH consists of five isoenzymes and LDV generally only has an effect on LDH A4. Another effect only occurs in the C58 and AKR type mice and involves destruction of lower motor neurons producing age-dependent polioencephalomyelitis. Other effects of the virus include a temporary fall in the total white blood cell count that lasts for twenty-four hours after infection.|$|E

50|$|Oligodendrocytes fail {{to recruit}} macrophages for debris removal. Macrophage entry in general into CNS site of injury is very slow. In {{contrast}} to PNS, Microglia {{play a vital}} role in CNS wallerian degeneration. However, their recruitment is slower in comparison to macrophage recruitment in PNS by approximately 3 days. Further, microglia might be activated but hypertrophy, and fail to transform into fully phagocytic cells. Those microglia that do transform, clear out the debris effectively. Differentiating phagocytic microglia can be accomplished by testing for expression of Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II during wallerian degeneration.The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> is very slow among microglia in comparison to macrophages. Possible source for variations in clearance rates could include lack ofopsonin activity around microglia, and the lack of increased permeability in the blood-brain barrier. The decreased permeability could further hinder macrophage infiltration to the site of injury.|$|E
50|$|In {{clinical}} practice, however, {{creatinine clearance}} or estimates of creatinine clearance {{based on the}} serum creatinine level are used to measure GFR. Creatinine is produced naturally by the body (creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate, which is found in muscle). It is freely filtered by the glomerulus, but also actively secreted by the peritubular capillaries in very small amounts such that creatinine clearance overestimates actual GFR by 10% to 20%. This margin of error is acceptable, considering {{the ease with which}} creatinine clearance is measured. Unlike precise GFR measurements involving constant infusions of inulin, creatinine is already at a steady-state concentration in the blood, and so measuring creatinine clearance is much less cumbersome. However, creatinine estimates of GFR have their limitations. All of the estimating equations depend on a prediction of the 24-hour creatinine excretion rate, which is a function of muscle mass which is quite variable. One of the equations, the Cockcroft and Gault equation (see below) does not correct for race. With a higher muscle mass, serum creatinine will be higher for any given <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>clearance.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} similar {{compounds}} contained in cannabis {{that do not}} exhibit any psychoactive response but are obligatory for functionality: cannabidiol (CBD), an isomer of THC; cannabivarin (CBV), an analog of cannabinol (CBN) with a different side chain, cannabidivarin (CBDV), an analog of CBD with a different side chain, and cannabinolic acid. How these other compounds interact with THC is not fully understood. Some clinical studies have proposed that CBD acts as a balancing force to regulate {{the strength of the}} psychoactive agent THC. CBD is also believed to regulate the body’s metabolism of THC by inactivating cytochrome P450, an important class of enzymes that metabolize drugs. Experiments in which mice were treated with CBD followed by THC showed that CBD treatment was associated with a substantial increase in brain concentrations of THC and its major metabolites, most likely because it decreased the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> of THC from the body. Cannabis cofactor compounds have also been linked to lowering body temperature, modulating immune functioning, and cell protection. The essential oil of cannabis contains many fragrant terpenoids which may synergize with the cannabinoids to produce their unique effects. THC is converted rapidly to 11-hydroxy-THC, which is also pharmacologically active, so the drug effect outlasts measurable THC levels in blood.|$|E
40|$|The {{onset of}} {{resistance}} to infection with virulent and avirulent strains of Salmonella gallinarum has been studied in chickens during the first 5 weeks of development. Resistance and susceptibility were measured by the decline or increase, respectively, of bacterial populations in the liver and spleen, {{as well as by}} the LD 50. There was a dramatic increase in resistance to the avirulent strain from 1 to 5 days after hatching, but the virulent strain remained more lethal until 5 weeks of age. Virulence was associated with bacterial growth. In susceptible hosts, the incremental bacterial growth during the first 4 days after injection was inversely proportional to the LD 50. Natural opsonins did not appear to contribute, in more than a minor way, to resistance to infection. There was no difference in <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> either strain from the circulation during the first week, yet resistance to the avirulent strain became fully established during this period. Conversely, 5 -week-old chickens, which are highly resistant to both strains, cleared the avirulent strain much more rapidly than the virulent strain. Possible reasons for different <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> various forms of bacteria are discussed.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{four types of}} {{artificial}} kidney on dialyzer clearance rates and serum pharmacokinetics of gentamicin were compared. In 19 patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, the mean (± SE) interdialysis half-life of gentamicin in serum was 49. 3 ± 3. 5 hr, whereas during dialysis this value was reduced to 10. 0 ± 0. 7 hr. The mean half-life of gentamicin in serum at conventional flow rates for the Hol-low Fiber Kidney, Kiil, Gambro, and Coil dialyzers was 11. 3, 10. 9, 8. 2, and 7. 4 hr, respectively, and the mean values for <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> gentamicin were 26, 28, 42, and 48 ml per min, respectively.

40|$|To further {{delineate}} the mechanisms underlying murine pulmonary defenses against bacterial infection, we studied {{the effects of}} antioxidant enzymes and hydroxyl radical scavengers on pulmonary clearance processes.

[...] While not involving G2A receptor binding, some actions of LPCs are G2A-dependent. For example, LPCs increase the bactericidal activity of rodent neutrophils, enhance hydrogen peroxide production in rodent neutrophils {{triggered by the}} ingestion of bacteria, stimulate the chemotaxis of human monocytes, and protect mice from the lethal effects of experimentally induced bacterial sepsis endotoxin. G2A may similarly {{be responsible for the}} activities of other phospholipids which, like LPC have not been shown to bind to G2A but still require G2A for certain of their activities viz., lysophosphatidylserine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine; these two lyso-phospholipids stimulate calcium signaling pathways in human neutrophils by a G2A dependent mechanism. [...] Furthermore, activated neutrophils greatly increase their surface membrane content of lysophosphatidylserine. In a mouse model, mouse neutrophils with increased levels of lysophosphatidylserine on their surface membrane due to cell activation or artificial addition showed an increase in there engulfment by mouse macrophages in vitro that was dependent on the expression of G2A in the macrophages and an increased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> in mice by a mechanism that was dependent on the expression of G2A by the mice. [...] Lysophosphotidylserine-laden neutrophils stimulated the G2A-dependent production the anti-inflammatory mediator, prostaglandin E2, by macrophages in the in vitro studies and inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, interleukin-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant, in in vivo studies. Taken together, these studies suggest that G2A, activated by certain phospholipids contributes not only to the development but also the resolution of certain inflammation and innate immune responses in mice and may also do so in humans.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Progress {{in therapy}} for cryptococcal {{meningitis}} {{has been slow}} {{because of the lack}} of a suitable marker of treatment response. Previously, we demonstrated the statistical power of a novel endpoint, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> of infection, based on serial quantitative cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, to differentiate the fungicidal activity of alternative antifungal drug regimens. We hypothesized that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> of infection should also be a clinically meaningful endpoint. METHODS: We combined data from cohorts of patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated cryptococcal meningitis from Thailand, South Africa, and Uganda, for whom the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> of infection was determined, and clinical and laboratory data prospectively collected, and explored the association between the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> of infection and mortality by Cox survival analyses.

40|$|The {{ability to}} control HCV with IFN-α-based {{treatments}} provides an opportunity in humans to study how the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> viral <b>clearance</b> in vivo impinges {{on the development of}} antiviral responses. Ex vivo (IFN-γ-producing) and cultured antiviral CD 4 + T cells, serum cytokines, and viral loads were measured repeatedly in a cohort of chronically HCV-infected subjects (n = 33) receiving IFN-α. Rapid control of virus indicated by an increased calculated <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> virus <b>clearance,</b> occurred in those subjects demonstrating absent/minimal T-cell responses (p < 0. 0006). Surprisingly, in subjects who demonstrated the most robust T-cell responses (and reduced serum IL- 10), there was actually a reduced <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> early virus <b>clearance.</b> A subsequent analysis of NK-cell function in available subjects (n = 8) revealed an inverse correlation between pretreatment NK-cell expression of NKp 46 and the potential to upregulate cytotoxic function on exposure to IFN-α (p < 0. 004), as well as the subsequent measured <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> viral <b>clearance</b> (p = 0. 045).

Glucose uptake was imaged using a fluorescent glucose analog, 2 -[N-(7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diaxol- 4 -yl) amino]- 2 -deoxyglucose (2 -NBDG). SO 2 was imaged using the differential absorption properties of oxygenated [HbO 2] and deoxygenated hemoglobin [dHb]. This study {{was carried out}} on two sibling murine mammary adenocarcinoma lines, 4 T 1 and 4 T 07. 2 -NBDG uptake in the 4 T 1 tumors was lowest when <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> delivery and <b>clearance</b> were lowest, indicating perfusion-limited uptake in poorly oxygenated tumor regions. For increasing <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> delivery that were still lower than the glucose consumption rate (as measured in vitro), both 2 -NBDG uptake and the clearance rate from the tumor increased. When the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> delivery of 2 -NBDG exceeded the glucose consumption rate, 2 -NBDG uptake decreased with any further increase in <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> delivery, but the clearance rate continued to increase.

40|$|Interest in {{effects of}} diet on {{postprandial}} lipoproteins {{has increased in}} recent years as a result of accumulating evidence for adverse cardiovascular consequences of elevated concentrations of triglyceride rich lipoproteins. Particular attention has been given to ability of different fatty acids to modulate postprandial lipoprotein responses because of evidence for both harmful and protective cardiovascular properties of the saturated, monounsaturated and ω- 6 and ω- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) classes. Evidence for direct atherogenic properties of chylomicron remnants has led to attempts to monitor effects of diet specifically on this lipoprotein class. Limitations in the methods employed to measure chylomicron remnants and the small number of human studies which have evaluated effects of meal, and background diet, fatty acid composition, makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions at the present time. However consideration of data from both animal and human studies tends to support the conclusion that diets, and meals, rich in PUFA (particularly long chain ω- 3 PUFA), result in attenuated postprandial responses of the intestinally-derived lipoproteins. Attenuated responses to high PUFA meals appear to be due to greater <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> and greater activation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL).
