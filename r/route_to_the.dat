5|$|In 1494, the {{principal}} maritime powers, Portugal and Spain, signed a treaty which drew a line {{down the middle}} of the Atlantic Ocean and allocated all trade routes to the east of the line to Portugal. That gave Portugal dominance of the only known <b>route</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east—via the Cape of Good Hope and Indian Ocean, which left Spain, and later other countries, to seek a western <b>route</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pacific. The exploration of the south began as part of the search for such a route.|$|E

It is the route used by the annual Snowdon Race, with a record time of less than 40 minutes recorded from the start to the summit.|$|E

5|$|As {{the regular}} season champion, FC Gold Pride earned a direct <b>route</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{championship}} playoff game where they faced the Philadelphia Independence. Sinclair contributed two goals to FC Gold Pride's 4–0 win to clinch the WPS Championship. Despite their successful season, the club ceased operations on November 16, 2010, due to not meeting the league's financial reserve requirement.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{north into}} the town of Sparta, NY63 runs along {{the east side of}} a wide, rural valley {{surrounding}} Canaseraga Creek, with NY36 and I-390 following the west side. The route eventually reaches the town of Groveland and hamlet of Groveland Station, where NY258, a connector to NY36, comes in from the west at the town line. Another long, open stretch brings the <b>route</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of the village of Mount Morris, where it runs much closer to I-390 and indirectly connects to the expressway by way of NY408 at Hampton Corners. From this point north, the road becomes busier as NY63 is the primary <b>route</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village of Geneseo for northbound traffic on I-390 itself, as there is no exit {{at the point where the}} expressway crosses under NY63. I-390 ultimately bypasses Geneseo to the southeast while NY63 heads north toward the village, briefly joining with U.S. Route20A (US20A) and NY39 just outside the village limits.|$|E

Fernandez, a landing craft coxswain, was awarded a Silver Lifesaving Medal for maneuvering a Marine landing party ashore under constant Japanese attack. The first known Hispanic-American Coast Guardsman to be awarded with a Bronze Star Medal was Louis Rua, whose craft, a U.S. Army large tug en <b>route</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philippines, went to the rescue of another ship which had been torpedoed by enemy action and helped saved 277 survivors from the abandoned ship, while serving aboard a U.S. Army large tug en <b>route</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philippines.|$|E
