40|$|We study <b>refined</b> topological {{string theory}} in the {{presence}} of orientifolds by counting second-quantized BPS states in M-theory.

We use the SO(2 N) <b>refined</b> Chern-Simons theory to compute new invariants of torus knots that generalize the Kauffman polynomials.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of the <b>refined</b> palm oil addition (20 %) on the fatty acid and sterol compositions of <b>refined</b> olive oil or <b>refined</b> soya bean oil and also to investigate the formation of total polar compounds and volatile compounds in these oil blends during fifty successive deep-frying sessions of potato fries at 180  °C. The blend of <b>refined</b> olive oil and <b>refined</b> palm oil exhibited a higher chemical stability during the frying process than that of <b>refined</b> soya bean oil and <b>refined</b> palm oil. Indeed, the total polar compounds and volatile compounds formed, especially 2, 4 -decadienal, were found to be relatively increased in the <b>refined</b> soya bean oil/refined palm oil blend reaching 36. 50 % and 46. 70 %, respectively, after fifty deep-frying sessions. Moreover, the degradation of linoleic acid and β-sitosterol was significantly (P <  0. 05) observed for the <b>refined</b> soya bean oil/refined palm oil blend.

5|$|Another {{commodity}} {{that was}} a prominent source of trade was the production of sugar from the crop sugar cane. The original habitat of sugar was in India, where it was taken and planted in various islands. Once reaching {{to the people of}} the Iberian Peninsula, it was further migrated across the Atlantic Ocean. In the 16th century, the first plantations of sugar were started in the New World, marking the last great stage of migration of the cane to the West. Because of the conflict of transporting sugar in its raw form, sugar was not associated with commerce until the act of <b>refining</b> it came into play; this act became the center for industry. Venice was the center for <b>refining</b> during the Middle Ages, therefore making them the chief traders of sugar. Although, the Spanish and Portuguese held the monopolies of the sugar cane fields in America, they were being supplied by Venice. In the 17th century, England dominated Venice and became the center for <b>refining</b> and cultivating sugar; this leadership was maintained until the rise of French industry. Sugar throughout the 17th century was still considered a luxury until the latter half of the 17th century when the sugar was being produced in mass quantities making it available to the mass of the English people. This turn of events made the sugar a commodity, because the crop was not being used in only special occasion, but in all daily meals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{formulate}} a <b>refined</b> {{version of the}} Ooguri-Strominger-Vafa (OSV) conjecture. The OSV conjecture that ZBH = |Ztop| 2 relates the BPS black hole partition function to the topological string partition function Ztop. In the <b>refined</b> conjecture, ZBH is the partition function of BPS black holes counted with spin, or more precisely the protected spin character. Ztop becomes the partition function of the <b>refined</b> topological string, which is itself an index. Both the original and the <b>refined</b> conjecture are examples of large N duality in the ’t Hooft sense. The <b>refined</b> conjecture applies to non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds only, so the black holes are really BPS particles with large entropy, of order N 2. The <b>refined</b> OSV conjecture states that the <b>refined</b> BPS partition function has a large N dual which is captured by the <b>refined</b> topological string. We provide evidence that the conjecture holds by studying local Calabi-Yau threefolds consisting of line bundles over a genus g Riemann surface. We show that the <b>refined</b> topological string partition function on these geometries is computed by a two-dimensional TQFT. We also study the <b>refined</b> black hole partition function arising from N D 4 branes on the Calabi-Yau, and argue that it reduces to a (q, t) -deformed version of two-dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills. Finally, we show that in the large N limit this theory factorizes to {{the square of the}} <b>refined</b> topological string in accordance with the <b>refined</b> OSV conjecture. a...|$|R

40|$|The work is fourfold.

Third, an explicitly restarted <b>refined</b> harmonic Arnoldi algorithm is developed over an augmented Krylov subspace. Finally, numerical examples are reported that compare the new algorithm with the implicitly restarted harmonic Arnoldi algorithm (IRHA) and the implicitly restarted <b>refined</b> harmonic Arnoldi algorithm (IRRHA). Numerical results confirm efficiency of the new algorithm. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Quiver-like Chern-Simons theories, arising from Calabi-Yau manifolds with branes wrapped on several minimal S^ 3 's, give a dual description of a large class of toric Calabi-Yau. We use this to derive the <b>refined</b> topological string amplitudes on a toric Calabi-Yau containing a shrinking P^ 2 surface. The result is suggestive of the <b>refined</b> topological vertex formalism for arbitrary toric Calabi-Yau manifolds in terms of a pair of vertices and a choice of a Morse flow on the toric graph, determining the vertex decomposition. The dependence on the flow is reminiscent of the approach to the <b>refined</b> topological string in upcoming work of Nekrasov and Okounkov. As a byproduct, we show that large N duality of the <b>refined</b> topological string explains the ``mirror symmetry`` of the <b>refined</b> colored HOMFLY invariants of knots.
