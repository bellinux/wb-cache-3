30|$|For a {{radar pulse}} signal, after compression, the {{narrower}} pulse mainlobe is always accompanied by higher sidelobes. So, all pulse compression radars suffer from range side lobes which cause energy from strong reflections to leak into adjacent range cells. High suppression of side lobes {{is not required}} in some other non-meteorological radar, but is important for meteorological radar, because weather phenomena can have significant <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradients,</b> and ground clutter echo can be between 35 and 55 dB much larger than medium rain. Furthermore, the side lobes of strong signal will falsely be recognized as an existence of small target. Therefore, range side lobes must be suppressed by a large amount to prevent contamination in adjacent range cells.|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} {{radar reflectivity}} Ze {{measured by a}} radar is the convolution of the actual distribution of reflectivity with the beam radiation pattern. Because of the nonlinearity between Z and rain rate R, Ze gives a biased estimator of R whenever the reflectivity field is nonuniform. In the presence of sharp horizontal <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradients,</b> the measured pattern of Ze extends beyond the actual precipitation boundaries to produce false precipitation echoes. When integrated across the radar image of the storm, the false echo areas contribute to the sum to produce overestimates of the areal rainfall. As the range or beamwidth increases, the ratio of measured to actual rainfall increases. Beyond some range, the normal decrease of reflectivity with height dominates and the measured rainfall underestimates the actual amount...|$|R

The optically important comet grains are about an order of magnitude larger than the optically important interstellar grains.

Analysis of images from the IRAC 5. 8 & 8. 0 μm bands and the MIPS 24. 0 & 70. 0 μm bands resulted in photometry measurements of the nucleus after a suite of coma modeling and removal processes were implemented.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{method for}} transforming radar-observed reflectivities Ze into rain rate R is presented. The method {{is based on}} a formulation of a Ze-R function constrained such that (1) the radar-retrieved pdf of R and all of its moments are identical to those determined from the gauges over a sufficiently large domain, and (2) the fraction of the time that it is raining above a low but still has an accurately measurable rain intensity is identical for both the radar and for simultaneous measurements of collocated gauges on average. Data measured by a 1. 65 -deg beamwidth C-band radar and 22 gauges located in the vicinity of Darwin, Australia, are used. The resultant Ze-R functions show a strong range dependence, especially for the rain regimes characterized by strong <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradients</b> and substantial attenuation. The application of these novel Ze-R functions to the radar data produces excellent matches to the gauge measurements without any systematic bias...|$|R

Previous studies have investigated the difference in structure between continental and oceanic storms, and tropical versus mid-latitude storms. This is the first study that has investigated the differences in vertical structure between lightning producing storm cells, and non-lightning producing cells over the tropical oceans. The characteristics of lightning locations with respect to radar reflectivity were also examined. Lightning characteristics of flashes associated with TOGA COARE storm cells were examined. One hundred fifty-three flashes were detected by three direction finders within the study area, a 150 kilometer circle around the Vickers research vessel. Radar <b>reflectivities</b> and <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradients</b> were compared to flash counts. It was found that lightning flashes tended to occur in the convective region (the region enclosed by the 30 dBZ contour) with a peak at 37 dBZ, but avoiding the highest reflectivity values. Flashes often occurred in <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradients</b> higher than 3 dBZ/km at 2 and 5 kilometers, which is the likely position of an updraft-downdraft interface. Isolated storm cells from four days during TOGA COARE were analyzed. Mean vertical profiles of radar reflectivity (VPRR) were constructed; these profiles were compared with other VPRRs from other tropical oceanic storms, and tropical and mid latitude continental storms. Reflectivity lapse rates were found to be effective in discriminating between lightning and non-lightning storms. A connection between the amount of lightning flashes and characteristics of VPRRs was examined. It was found that lightning and non-lightning storm cell VPRRs were associated with lower reflectivity lapse rates than ever previously been found for tropical oceanic storms. Reflectivity lapse rate of the mean profiles of lightning storm cells was 3. 32 dBZ/km versus the 4. 33 dBZ/km found for non-lightning storms. Lightning storms had reflectivity lapse rates similar to 3. 5 dBZ/km lapse rate of tropical continental storms studied by Zipser and Lutz (I 994). Lapse rates of non-lightning cells significantly exceeded lapse rates from other cells in different tropical oceanic regimes...|$|R
40|$|On 21 October 1999, {{a severe}} {{thunderstorm}} developed over areas 50 km south of Johannesburg. This weather system produced a large tornado (F 3 on the FP scale) which crossed the Heidelberg farming district (between Vanderbiljpark and Secunda). Relatively little damage occurred, {{but there were}} minor injuries and damage to property. In this paper the event is analyzed by means of all available observation data, including conventional radar data which showed significant reflectivities as well as good <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradient.</b> The authors also made use of the 0 and 6 h fields of the local version of the Eta model (48 km resolution) in order to supplement the sparse data coverage over the country. Indications of instability and shear were analyzed on plan view {{as well as by}} means of model soundings. Several indicators of severe weather and possible tornadic activity could be found. Although only a few tornadoes occur every year in South Africa, these events cause damage and loss of life. It is therefore essential to investigate and research the occurrence of tornadoes with the little bit of observational data that is available. 1...|$|E
40|$|Least-squares {{migration}} (LSM) is a linearized {{inversion technique}} for subsurface reflectivity estimation. Compared to conventional migration algorithms, it can improve spatial resolution significantly {{with a few}} iterative calculations. There are three key steps in LSM, (1) calculate data residuals between observed data and demigrated data using the inverted reflectivitymodel; (2) migrate data residuals to form <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradient</b> and (3) update reflectivity model using optimization methods. In order to obtain an accurate and high-resolution inversion result, the good estimation of inverse Hessian matrix plays a crucial role. However, due to the large size of Hessian matrix, the inverse matrix calculation is always a tough task. The limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) method can evaluate the Hessian matrix indirectly using {{a limited amount of}} computer memory which only maintains a history of the past m gradients (often m < 10). We combine the L-BFGS method with least-squares pre-stack Kirchhoff depth migration. Then, we validate the introduced approach by the 2 -D Marmousi synthetic data set and a 2 -D marine data set. The results show that the introduced method can effectively obtain reflectivity model and has a faster convergence rate with two comparison gradient methods. It might be significant for general complex subsurface imaging...|$|E
40|$|The authors present herein an {{analysis}} of a single-Doppler velocity retrieval (SDVR) technique whereby the unobserved wind components are determined from single-Doppler radar data. The analysis {{is designed to provide}} information about the behavior and/or sensitivity of the SDVR scheme as a function of various internal and external parameters as well as about observational errors and weights. Results presented for retrieval of both the mean and local flow indicate that the SDVR breaks down if the <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradient</b> vanishes or if a reflectivity isoline is locally perpendicular to the radar beam. In the absence of reflectivity or radial velocity errors, the mean flow solution is independent of the integration area, the radar location, the signal wavenumber, and the weights. Given perfect radial wind information, error in the reflectivity field degrades the solution. Contrary to the error-free solution, the solution with error depends on the integration area. Error statistics indicate that radial wind information alone is not sufficient to retrieve the local wind. Reduced error norms reveal that an optimal (i. e., reduced error norms) integration area exists that is dependent upon the length of time between radar volume scans, suggesting that the velocity field is not stationary (as was assumed) over these scans. 1...|$|E

Column densities of CN, C 3, CH, C 2, and NH 2 were calculated from measured fluxes in these spectra, and molecular scale lengths were deduced from the radial distribution of CN, C 3, C 2, and NH 2. Production rates were computed {{using the new}} scale lengths and a Haser model analysis. Continuum emission at 4260 A was used to derive gas-to-dust ratios. The data indicate than comet Halley was approximately 2 - 5 times more abundant in gas and dust at postperihelion than preperihelion. On 1986 June 8 we observed the onset of a cometary ourburst which appeared very strong in dust production. The gas-to-dust ratios appeared {{to be subject to}} changes as a result of short-term outbursts but otherwise did not exhibit any systematic dependence on heliocentric distance. <b>Reflectivity</b> <b>gradients</b> of the continuum were also measured from the spectra.

40|$|An {{inversion}} {{scheme that}} solves for reservoir pressure and fluid saturation changes from time-lapse pre-stack seismic attributes and post-stack seismic time-shifts is presented. It {{makes use of}} four equations expressing the changes in zero-offset and <b>gradient</b> <b>reflectivities,</b> compressional and shear waves time-shifts as functions of production induced changes in fluid properties. The method has been successfully tested on a realistic, synthetic reservoir, where seismic data have been modeled before and after 30 years production and water injection. Results show very accurate estimations if information about the vertically averaged reservoir porosity is available. The use of the <b>gradient</b> <b>reflectivity</b> equation causes biased estimations of real changes in saturation and strong leakage between the two different parameters. However, if the equation related to the S-wave time-shift can replace the <b>gradient</b> <b>reflectivity</b> equation, the inversion results may be very accurate. In cases where shear wave data might not be acquired, the approximation of the exact changes in this seismic attribute becomes more accurate if quadratic terms in relative changes of seismic properties are not neglected. The improved forward approximation in this attribute leads to inversion results characterized by weaker leakage and sharper discrimination between different fluid effects...|$|R
40|$|Whenever Viking Orbiter images {{included}} the limb of Mars, they recorded {{one or more}} layers of clouds above the limb. The height above the limb and the brightness (reflectivity) of these clouds were determined in a selected group of these images.

Many reach heights of over 60 km, and several are over 70 km above the limb. Statistically, the reflectivity of the clouds increases with phase angle. Reflectivity and height both appear to vary with season, but the selected images spanned only one Martian year, so the role of seasons cannot be isolated. Limb clouds in red-filter images tend to be brighter than violet-filter images, but both season and phase appear to be more dominant factors. Due to the limited sample available, the possible influences of latitude and longitude are less clear.

40|$|On 7 May 2005, a {{squall line}} with an {{embedded}} bow echo formed over Southern Romania causing severe wind damage. The {{length of the}} wind damage was around 150 km. Three tornadoes have been reported, two of them being recorded by video camera. One of the tornadoes occurred in Buftea (near Bucharest), the second in Ciobanu village (near Medgidia radar site) and the third in Movilita village, 40 km to the northeast of Bucharest. The site surveys confirmed wind damage associated with these tornadoes. Based on damage, the Movilita village tornado was classified as an F 1 type on the Fujita scale, and the Buftea and Ciobanu village tornadoes were classified as F 0. Large scale forcing was provided by a vigorous upper level trough. The squall line developed in the warm sector of a low, ahead of the cold front. The Bucharest EEC-DWSR- 2500 C Doppler velocity depicted cyclonically rotational structures associated with the left end of the bow echo. In two hours this squall line traversed {{the southern part of}} the country. The northern end of the line preserved the bowed structures and high <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradient</b> in front of them. The dry air associated with the descending rear inflow jet was evident as rear inflow notches in the reflectivity field of the Bucharest C-band radar and the Medgidia S-band WSR- 98 D radar. The synoptic and mesoscale environment associated with 7 May 2005 bow echo had many similarities to the "dynamic" pattern described by John and Hirt (1987). Herein are analyzed the combined effects of synoptic and mesoscale circulations, together with the data provided by C-band EEC-DWSR- 2500 C and S-band WSR- 98 D radars, and the ECMWF and ALADIN model output data.

40|$|Total {{lightning}} mapping, {{along with}} radar and NLDN cloud-to-ground lightning data, {{can be used}} to diagnose the severity of a storm. Analysis of the 13 October 2001 supercell event (Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas), some supercells of which were tornadic, shows that LDAR II lightning source heights (quartile, median, and 95 th percentile heights) increased as the storms intensified. Most of the total lightning occurred where reflectivity cores extended upwards and within regions of <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradient</b> rather than in reflectivity cores. A total lightning hole was associated with an intense, nontornadic supercell on 6 April 2003. This feature was nonexistent from all supercells analyzed during the 13 October case. During tornadogenesis, the radar and LDAR II data indicated updraft weakening. The height of the 30 dBZ radar top began to descend approximately 10 minutes (2 volume scans) before tornado touchdown in one storm. Total lightning and CG flash rates decreased by up to a factor of 5 to a minimum during an F 2 tornado touchdown associated with this storm. LDAR II source heights all showed descent by 2 - 4 km during a 25 minute period prior to and during this tornado touchdown. This drastic trend of decreasing source heights was observed in two tornadic storms prior to and during tornado touchdown, but did not occur in non-tornadic supercells, suggesting that these parameters can be useful to forecasters. These observations agree with tornadogenesis theory that an updraft weakens and the mesocyclone can become divided (composed of both updraft and downdraft) when a storm becomes tornadic. LDAR II source density contours were comma-shaped in association with severe wind events within mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) on 13 October 2001 and 27 May 2002. This signature is similar to the radar reflectivity bow echo. Consistent relationships between severe weather, radar and lightning storm characteristics (i. e., lightning heights) were not found for cells within MCSs as was the case for supercells. Cell interactions within MCSs are believed to weaken these relationships as reflectivity and lightning from nearby storms contaminate the cells of interest. It is also more difficult to clearly define a cell within an MCS...|$|E
40|$|Application of {{the window}} {{probability}} matching method to radar and rain gauge data that have been objectively classified into different rain types resulted in distinctly different Z(sub e) -R relationships for the various classifications. These classification parameters, {{in addition to the}} range from the radar, are (a) the horizontal radial <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradients</b> (dB/km); (b) the cloud depth, as scaled by the effective efficiency; (c) the brightband fraction within the radar field window; and (d) the height of the freezing level. Combining physical parameters to identify the type of precipitation and statistical relations most appropriate to the precipitation types results in considerable improvement of both point and areal rainfall measurements. A limiting factor in the assessment of the improved accuracy is the inherent variance between the true rain intensity at the radar measured volume and the rain intensity {{at the mouth of the}} rain guage. Therefore, a very dense rain gauge network is required to validate most of the suggested realized improvement.

40|$|Doppler radar {{measurements}} in {{a number}} of Hawaiian rain echoes indicated a vari-able amount of convection, with vertical air velocities ranging from unmeasurably small values in some cases to values of 7 m/sec in the more convective cases. The echoes exhibiting weak vertical motions usually had a stratiform appearance when plotted on coordinates of height versus time: contours of signal intensity and Doppler velocity tended to be approximately horizontal. The intensity decreased with altitude in these cases, and vertical gradients as strong as 20 db/km were not uncommon. In the echoes exhibiting strong vertical air motions, signal intensities, echo depth, and surface rainfall rate tended to be higher. Radar reflectivity factors as high as lo 6 mm 6 /m 3 were observed. Although height-time patterns revealed less order than in the echoes with weak updraft velocities, there was a tendency for the leading (upslope) portion of a convective echo to be more active than the trailing portion. As echoes progressed further upslope they tended to become more stratiform in character. The fact that moderate rain could at times fall from shallow, stratiform clouds, taken in conjunction with the strong vertical <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradients</b> observed in these cases, indicates a high efficiency of the precipitation process in Hawaiian orographic clouds. The observations in convective echoes clearly demonstrate that convective motions erihance the process...|$|R

The classification parameters are (a) E(sub e), effective efficiency, as determined by cloud-top and cloud-base water vapor saturation mixing ratios; (b) BBF, brightband fraction, {{as determined by the}} fraction of the radar echo area in which the maximal reflectivity occurs within +/- 1. 5 km of the 0 C isotherm level; and (c) del(sub r) Z, radial <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradients</b> (dB/km). These classification criteria were applied to tropical rain cloud systems near Darwin, Australia, and to winter convective rain cloud systems in Israel. Both sets of measurements were made with nearly identical networks of C-band radars and rain gauge networks. The results of the application of these objective classification criteria to several independently predetermined rain regimes in Darwin have shown that better organized rain systems have smaller del(sub r) Z and larger BBF. Similarly, smaller del(sub r) Z and larger BBF were also observed from maritime rain cloud systems, as compared to continental rain cloud systems with the same degree of organization. Continental rain cloud system, regardless of their degree of organization, have larger depths, as expressed by E(sub e).

The evolution of the area-averaged vertical velocity within the objectively defined convective region of the 4 June 1985 PRE-STORM (Preliminary Regional Experiment for Stormscale Operational and Research Meteorology-Central Phase) mesoscale convective complex (MCC) was examined over a 100 minute period during the storm's mature stage and compared to that of a squall line. The area-averaged vertical velocity profiles from twenty dual-Doppler analyses indicated significant differences in convective intensity both spatially and temporally. The peak magnitudes of the mid-to-upper level area-averaged vertical velocity were initially comparable to those from a squall line but became much weaker. The distribution of vertical velocities at mid-to-upper levels was consistent with weakening convection as the percentage of weak updrafts and downdrafts grew at the expense of stronger vertical motions. Typically the non-squall MCC had a much larger percentage of strong downdrafts than did the squall line. Horizontal and vertical cross-sections of both vertical velocity and reflectivity confirmed that the MCC was evolving toward a state with fewer and less intense updraft cores while cross-sections of storm relative flow revealed a descending rear-to-front inflow at later analysis times which reached the surface near locations of active convection. The relationship of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning to the kinematic structure of the MCC was also studied. For mesoscale regions there was a 10 - 20 minute time lag between the peak convective intensity and the peak CG flash rate. A similar delay was found on the convective scale for some convective cells, however, other apparently similar cells had little CG lightning throughout their evolution. An analysis of the vertical profiles of the vertical velocity, reflectivity and their gradients above CG lightning suggested a preferred vertical structure of these fields for CG lightning. CG lightning occurred beneath greater than average vertical velocities at mid-to-upper levels and greater than average vertical velocity gradients and reflectivity at all levels. CG lightning also occurred beneath greater than average reflectivity gradients at mid and upper-levels but beneath smaller than average reflectivity gradients at low-levels due to its avoidance of the highest <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradient</b> regions...|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} {{intends to}} prove that a network of low-cost local area weather radars (LAWR) is a reliable and scientifically valuable complement to nationwide radar networks. A network of four LAWRs has been installed in northern Germany {{within the framework of}} the Precipitation and Attenuation Estimates from a High-Resolution Weather Radar Network (PATTERN) project observing precipitation with a temporal resolution of 30 s, a range resolution of 60 m and a sampling resolution of 1 ° in the azimuthal direction. The network covers an area of 60 km × 80 km. In this paper, algorithms used to obtain undisturbed precipitation fields from raw reflectivity data are described, and their performance is analysed. In order to correct operationally for background noise in reflectivity measurements, noise level estimates from the measured reflectivity field are combined with noise levels from the last 10 time steps. For detection of non-meteorological echoes, two different kinds of clutter algorithms are applied: single-radar algorithms and network-based algorithms. Besides well-established algorithms based on the texture of the logarithmic reflectivity field (TDBZ) or sign changes in the <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradient</b> (SPIN), the advantage of the unique features of the high temporal and spatial resolution of the network is used for clutter detection. Overall, the network-based clutter algorithm works best with a detection rate of up to 70 %, followed by the classic TDBZ filter using the texture of the logarithmic reflectivity field. A comparison of a reflectivity field from the PATTERN network with the product from a C-band radar operated by the German Meteorological Service indicates high spatial accordance of both systems in the geographical position of the rain event as well as reflectivity maxima. Long-term statistics from May to September 2013 prove very good accordance of the X-band radar of the network with C-band radar, but, especially at the border of precipitation events, higher-resolved X-band radar measurements provide more detailed information on precipitation structure because the 1 km range gate of C-band radars is only partially covered with rain. The standard deviation within a range gate of the C-band radar with a range resolution of 1 km is up to 3 dBZ at the borders of rain events. The probability of detection is at least 90 %, the false alarm ratio less than 10 % for both systems. Therefore, a network of high-resolution low-cost LAWRs can give valuable information on the small-scale structure of rain events in areas of special interest, e. g. urban regions, in addition to the nationwide radar networks...|$|E
40|$|A {{remote sensing}} {{approach}} for simultaneous retrievals of cloud and rainfall parameters in the vertical column above the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Climate Research Facility at the Tropical Western Pacific (TWP) Darwin site in Australia is described. This approach uses vertically pointing measurements from a DOE Ka-band radar and scanning measurements {{from a nearby}} C-band radar pointing toward the TWP Darwin site. Rainfall retrieval constraints are provided by data from a surface impact disdrometer. The approach is applicable to stratiform precipitating cloud systems when a separation between the liquid hydrometeor layer, which contains rainfall and liquid water clouds, and the ice hydrometeor layer {{is provided by the}} radar bright band. Absolute C-band reflectivities and Ka-band vertical <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradients</b> in the liquid layer are used for retrievals of the mean layer rain rate and cloud liquid water path (CLWP). C-band radar reflectivities are also used to estimate ice water path (IWP) in regions above the melting layer. The retrieval uncertainties of CLWP and IWP for typical stratiform precipitation systems are about 500 – 800 g m&minus; 2 (for CLWP) and a factor of 2 (for IWP). The CLWP retrieval uncertainties increase with rain rate, so retrievals for higher rain rates may be impractical. The expected uncertainties of layer mean rain rate retrievals are around 20 %, which, in part, is due to constraints available from the disdrometer data. The applicability of the suggested approach is illustrated for two characteristic events observed at the TWP Darwin site during the wet season of 2007. A future deployment of W-band radars at the DOE tropical Climate Research Facilities can improve CLWP estimation accuracies and provide retrievals for a wider range of stratiform precipitating cloud events...|$|R

In this paper, a technique to correct two different problems typically present in radar data is presented and evaluated. The aspects dealt with are non-precipitating echoes - caused either by permanent ground clutter or by anomalous propagation of the radar beam (anaprop echoes) - and also topographical beam blockage. The correction technique is based in the computation of realistic beam propagation trajectories based upon recent radiosonde observations instead of assuming standard radio propagation conditions. The correction consists of three different steps: 1) calculation of a Dynamic Elevation Map which provides the minimum clutter-free antenna elevation for each pixel within the radar coverage; 2) correction for residual anaprop, checking the vertical <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradients</b> within the radar volume; and 3) topographical beam blockage estimation and correction using a geometric optics approach. The technique is evaluated with four case studies in the region of the Po Valley (N Italy) using a C-band Doppler radar and a network of raingauges providing hourly precipitation measurements. The case studies cover different seasons, different radio propagation conditions and also stratiform and convective precipitation type events. After applying the proposed correction, a comparison of the radar precipitation estimates with raingauges indicates a general reduction in both the root mean squared error and the fractional error variance indicating the efficiency and robustness of the procedure. Moreover, the technique presented is not computationally expensive so it seems well suited to be implemented in an operational environment...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Satellite) Precipitation Radar (PR) {{products}} are evaluated {{by means of}} simultaneous comparisons with data from the high-altitude ER- 2 Doppler Radar (EDOP), as well as ground-based radars. The comparison is aimed primarily at the vertical reflectivity structure, which is of key importance in TRMM rain type classification and latent heating estimation. The radars {{used in this study}} have considerably different viewing geometries and resolutions, demanding non-trivial mapping procedures in common earth-relative coordinates. Mapped vertical cross sections and mean profiles of reflectivity from the PR, EDOP, and ground-based radars are compared for six cases. These cases cover a stratiform frontal rainband, convective cells of various sizes and stages, and a hurricane. For precipitating systems that are large relative to the PR footprint size, PR reflectivity profiles compare very well to high-resolution measurements thresholded to the PR minimum reflectivity, and derived variables such as bright band height and rain types are accurate, even at high PR incidence angles. It was found that for, the PR reflectivity of convective cells small relative to the PR footprint is weaker than in reality. Some of these differences can be explained by non-uniform beam filling. For other cases where strong <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradients</b> occur within a PR footprint, the reflectivity distribution is spread out due to filtering by the PR antenna illumination pattern. In these cases, rain type classification may err and be biased towards the stratiform type, and the average reflectivity tends to be underestimated. The limited sensitivity of the PR implies that the upper regions of precipitation systems remain undetected and that the PR storm top height estimate is unreliable, usually underestimating the actual storm top height. This applies to all cases but the discrepancy is larger for smaller cells where limited sensitivity is compounded by incomplete beam filling. Users of level three TRMM PR products should be aware of this scale dependency...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} from {{broad-band}} V- and R-filter observations obtained at the 4. 2 -m William Herschel Telescope on La Palma on 2002 July 12 - 14. A {{total of six}} comets were imaged, and their heliocentric distances ranged from 2. 8 to 6. 1 au. The comets observed were 43 P/Wolf-Harrington, 129 P/Shoemaker-Levy 3, 133 P/Elst-Pizarro, 143 P/Kowal-Mrkos, P/ 1998 U 4 (Spahr) and P/ 2001 H 5 (NEAT). A detailed surface brightness profile analysis indicates {{that three of the}} targeted comets (43 P/Wolf-Harrington, 129 P/Shoemaker-Levy 3 and P/ 1998 U 4) were visibly active, and the remaining three comets were stellar in appearance. Further analysis shows that for the three 'stellar-like' comets the possible coma contribution to the observed flux does not exceed 12. 2 per cent, {{and in the case of}} comet 143 P/Kowal-Mrkos the coma contribution is expected to be as low as 1 per cent, and so the resulting photometry most likely represents that of the projected nucleus surface. Effective radii for the inactive comets range from 1. 02 to 4. 56 km, and the effective radius upper limits for the active comets range from 1. 94 to 4. 15 km. We assume an albedo and phase coefficient of 0. 04 and 0. 035 mag deg^- 1, respectively, with the exception of comets 133 P/Elst-Pizarro and 143 P/Kowal-Mrkos for which phase coefficients were previously measured. These values are compared with previous measurements, and for comet 43 P/Wolf-Harrington we find that the nucleus axial ratio a/b could be as large as 2. 44. For the active comets we measured dust production levels in terms of the Af-rho quantity. Spectral gradients were extracted for two of the inactive comets from their measured broadband colour indices, and compared with the rest of the comet population for which (V - R) colour and spectral gradient values exist. We find a spectral gradient for 143 P/Kowal-Mrkos of 9. 9 ± 8. 1 per cent/ 100 nm, which is very typical of Jupiter-family comets, the majority of which have <b>reflectivity</b> <b>gradients</b> in the range 0 - 13 per cent (100 nm) ^- 1. The spectral gradient for comet 133 P/Elst-Pizarro is amongst the bluest yet measured. We measure a (V - R) colour index value of 0. 14 ± 0. 11 for the nucleus of 133 P/Elst-Pizarro which is considerably lower than previous measurements. A possible explanation for this difference is considered. © 2005 RAS...|$|R
40|$|A {{reliable}} {{estimate of}} reservoir pressure and fluid saturation changes from time-lapse seismic data {{is difficult to}} obtain. Existing methods generally suffer from leakage between the estimated parameters. We propose a new method using different combinations of time-lapse seismic attributes based on four equations: two expressing changes in prestack AVO attributes (zero-offset and <b>gradient</b> <b>reflectivities),</b> and two expressing poststack time-shifts of compressional and shear waves as functions of production-induced changes in fluid properties. The effect of using different approximations of these equations was tested on a realistic, synthetic reservoir, where seismic data have been simulated during the 30 -year lifetime of a water-flooded oil reservoir. Results found {{the importance of the}} porosity in the inversion with a clear attenuation of the porosity imprint on the final estimates in case the porosity field or the vertically averaged porosity field is known a priori. The use of a first-order approximation of the <b>gradient</b> <b>reflectivity</b> equation leads to severely biased estimates of changes in saturation and leakage between the two different parameters. Both the bias and the leakage can be reduced, if not eliminated, by including higher-order terms in the description of the gradient, or by replacing the gradient equation with P- and/or S-wave time-shift data. The final estimates are relatively robust to random noise, as they present fairly high accuracy in the presence of white noise {{with a standard deviation of}} 15 %. The introduction of systematic noise decreases the inversion accuracy more severely. © 2011 Society of Exploration Geophysicists...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{prediction}} of pressure {{as well as}} saturation effects from time-lapse seismic data {{is one of the}} topics of interest for geophysical society since the last decade. Time-lapse amplitude variation with offset (AVO) could be used for this purpose. The conventional pressure-saturation discrimination method suffers due to leakage between estimated pressuresaturation changes. However, the method works reasonably well for deeper reservoirs where the P-to-S-wave velocity ratio (Vp/Vs) is around 2. Objective of this thesis is to investigate the applicability of the conventional inversion method for shallow unconsolidated reservoirs where Vp/Vs is often higher than 2. In addition, {{it is also important to}} investigate the inaccuracy in the estimates (of pressure and saturation changes) due to improper implementation of rock physics parameters as well as consideration of first order approximations in AVO gradient and intercept changes. I propose a new method, based on a stepwise linear approximation to the intercept and <b>gradient</b> <b>reflectivity</b> changes, to estimate pressure and saturation changes. Similar to the conventional method the new method utilizes the near- and far offset seismic surveys as two independent measurements, and then estimates the pore pressure and saturation changes from amplitude versus offset (AVO). As the conventional pressure-saturation discrimination method has inaccuracy mainly due to <b>gradient</b> <b>reflectivity</b> attribute, it is crucial to explore the applicability of other seismic attributes, such as PS-reflectivity changes and travel time shifts, to discriminate between pressure-saturation changes. I investigate the applicability of various combinations of seismic attributes for compacting reservoir scenario. The usefulness of time-lapse seismic data greatly depends on the repeatability of the data between different surveys. The more repeatable the data is, the more confidently and efficiently it may be used in reservoir management. As the refraction method is emerging as one of the promising and complementary 4 D techniques, it is therefore necessary to perform repeatability analysis on refraction data as well. In addition, repeatability analysis on other seismic events (such as tank noise, normal modes, sea-bottom reflection) provide more insight on the efficient implementation of 4 D seismic method. I study repeatability issues using two seismic data sets acquired at the permanent sea-bottom array that was installed at the Ekofisk field (North Sea) in 2010. I compare pre-stack repeatability of various seismic wave types, such as refraction, reflection, sea-bottom reflection, tank noise and water column noise. In carbonate reservoirs, implementation of a proper rock physics model is extremely difficult due the more complex pore-geometry in carbonate rocks. It is therefore important to investigate various rock physics models and their applicability for carbonate reservoir.

30|$|Fractures are {{regarded}} as facilitating both migration and emplacement {{of oil and gas}} within reservoir rocks, and fracture assessment {{is one of the most}} critical issues in reservoir evaluation. Prediction and identification of fractures mainly involve post-stack geometric attributes analysis and related techniques dependent on the development of seismic anisotropies. Analysis of geometric attributes derived from post-stack seismic information is a mature discipline, and attributes such as amplitude, coherence and curvature are mainly used to describe faults and indirectly delineate belts of fracture system development. When considering micro-fractures smaller than the longitudinal resolution of the seismic wavelet, although individual fractures cannot be identified, their gross effect on reflection amplitude information can be applied to predict fracture properties, based on the theory of equivalent anisotropic media. Currently, common equivalent media theories include the Hudson (1980, 1981) model and linear-slip theory (Schoenberg 1980, 1983), and T-matrix theory that explicitly takes into account fracture interactions (Jakobsen et al. 2003; Zhao et al. 2016). These theories can describe a cluster of vertically and high-angle aligned fractures as an HTI medium. According to a P-wave reflection coefficient approximation in the HTI medium, the inversion of azimuth and azimuthal anisotropy is performed, seeking to solve for fracture direction and intensity (Ruger 1998; Schoenberg and Sayers 1995; Yin and Yang 1998; Bakulin et al. 2000; Zhu et al. 2001; Hall and Kendall 2003). In addition, fracture direction and fracture density can be estimated through the observed ellipse phenomenon of amplitude varying with azimuth (Liu and Dong 1999; Luo and Evans 2004; Yang et al. 1998). However, reservoirs may not only have high-angle fractures but also have low-angle fractures or horizontal fine layering background. Since the presence of horizontal fractures leads to a physically significant change of P-wave AVAZ (amplitude versus incident angle and azimuth) attributes including <b>reflectivity</b> intercept, <b>gradient</b> and anisotropic terms, application of the inversion method for conventional HTI medium AVAZ attributes is not appropriate for fracture prediction in orthorhombic media. The amplitude ellipse fitting method is affected by horizontal fractures and fluid properties so as to lower the accuracy of vertical fracture prediction. This means that predictive approaches to AVAZ based on an orthorhombic medium need to be modified to increase the accuracy of fracture prediction.|$|R
40|$|The world {{energy demand}} still {{increases}} every year. As a consequence, {{the demand for}} fossil fuels, by far the first energy source, is increasing, while easily accessible fossil fuel resources are decreasing. This has stimulated research and development to the optimization of hydrocarbon recovery from existing reservoirs over the last decade. Waterflooding for enhanced oil recovery is one approach to increase the recovery of an oil reservoir. In this thesis the monitoring of waterflooding using time lapse seismic data in combination with production data is used to improve the representative flow models of the reservoir. Such models are then used to optimize production strategies. When constraining a reservoir model to observations, the measurement uncertainty plays a key role. The {{first part of this}} thesis is dedicated to developing an inversion methodology leading to more accurate estimates of changes in saturation and pore pressure induced by waterflooding from 4 D seismic data. Waterflooding processes induce time-lapse changes in reservoir fluid saturation and in pore pressure. These are reflected in 4 D variations of seismic attributes like changes in amplitudes and time-shifts. The improvement of the proposed 4 D seismic inversion method resides in a more correct, and possibly unbiased, estimate of time-lapse changes in saturation and pore pressure. Existing methods often suffer from bias and leakage between the different estimated parameters. By making use of different combinations of time-lapse seismic attributes based on four equations: two expressing changes in pre-stack AVO attributes (zero-offset and <b>gradient</b> <b>reflectivities),</b> and two expressing post-stack time-shifts of compressional and shear waves as functions of production induced changes in fluid properties, the estimates can be considerably improved. The impact of using different combinations of these equations is tested on a synthetic, though realistic 3 D model, where seismic data have been simulated at various steps during the 30 years lifetime of the waterflooded reservoir. Results show that the inversion accuracy increases if higher order terms in the description of the P-wave <b>gradient</b> <b>reflectivity</b> are not neglected, or if, in case S-wave data are available, the S-wave time-shift equation replaces the equation related to the P-wave <b>gradient</b> <b>reflectivity.</b> As in all inversion methods, the influence of prior porosity estimates remains very high and results improve considerably, in case lateral variations of porosity are properly taken into account. The effect of noise on the inversion results is also investigated, with the conclusion that the method seems to be quite robust to random noise, while the introduction of systematic noise decreases the inversion accuracy more severely. The second part of this thesis is dedicated to the investigation of the possibilities to obtain an accurate model characterization, particularly in terms of flow, through the assimilation of seismic measurements with the Ensemble Kalman Filter. The mathematical process which identifies the parameter values that minimize a cost-function representing the mismatch between modeled and observed data is called Data Assimilation (or History Matching). In Data Assimilation, parameter estimations for the entire reservoir model, are often based only on the information related to sparsely distributed production data. It is obvious that in such a case the number of observations is much smaller than the number of parameters to estimate, making history matching a strongly ill-posed problem. The additional information acquired from (time-lapse) seismic data can be utilized to narrow the solution space down when minimizing the misfit between gathered measurements and their forecasts from numerical models. Although in literature numerous data assimilation methods have been presented, in this thesis the Ensemble Kalman Filter has been chosen for several reasons. Firstly, the method is computationally feasible for large systems and is relatively simple to implement making use of existing simulators. Secondly, it presents a flexible treatment of any kind and number of data or uncertain parameters. Thirdly, this method has a large and active research community, and a rigorous theoretical basis. This thesis proposes two innovative approaches to assimilate seismic measurements with the Ensemble Kalman Filter. The first approach concerns the assimilation of time-lapse changes in fluid saturation and pore pressure available for every reservoir gridblock. This method builds directly on the results of {{the first part of this}} thesis. In this case the number of observations to assimilate can be very high, causing the problem of ’filter divergence’. Filter divergence is a consequence of an excessive reduction of ensemble parameter covariance. The most effective method to circumvent this problem is Covariance regularization through Localization. This approach consists of multiplying the ensemble covariances element-wise by a local support matrix, resulting in a localized covariance estimate. For a correct application, localization requires the knowledge of the real covariance between measurements and states/parameters to update. Through a 2 D synthetic study rules of thumb for the definition of adequate localization functions have been determined. Afterwards these rules have been successfully applied on a 3 D reservoir. The second approach of seismic data assimilation is based on the assimilation of fluid front arrival times. The major advantage of the method is, that no full inversion of seismic data to saturations for each grid block is required. The focus is only on the fronts, where changes in time lapse seismic response can be observed. In this case saturation data, impedance maps, or even simple amplitude change maps can be assimilated as waterfront arrival times. This approach enables a very large reduction in number of data while retaining the essential information content. Furthermore, it offers a more linear sensitivity to reservoir properties and a more Gaussian distribution of simulated measurements than using saturation data. This tends to improve the functioning of the EnKF, which represents a multi-model history match that incorporates and retains geological information formulated in terms of two-point geostatistics. This method has also been successfully applied on a slightly modified version of the benchmark Brugge field, a synthetic study reflecting to a great extent the complexity of a real field.

40|$|Two {{lines of}} {{research}} are studied: (1) return stroke current reflections in rocket-triggered lightning, and (2) {{the evolution of}} lightning activity via radar and the Lightning Mapping Array (LMA). (1) An unusual waveshape seen in the channel-base current and electric field measurements from {{a reflection of the}} return stroke wave is modeled and analyzed. Average return stroke speed calculations were performed using the channel-base current and high-speed video data, and values range between 0. 81 and 2. 06 x 10 ^ 8 ms^- 1. The return stroke speeds that best match the model results with the measured electric fields were 1. 2 x 10 ^ 8 ms^- 1 and 1. 7 x 10 ^ 8 ms^- 1 for the upward and downward current waves, respectively. (2) The evolution of lightning activity in two types of storms in North-Central Florida, summer multi-cell and winter/spring frontal storms, was analyzed for the first time using the location of VHF sources of lightning leaders and other breakdown processes recorded by the LMA. In the winter/spring storms, the charge regions were found to be up to 1 km lower in altitude than in summer storms. This is most likely due to the 0 C, - 10 C and - 20 C isotherms being up to 1 km lower for the winter/spring storms than for the summer storms. Changes in the lightning activity in summer storms are highly correlated with changes in radar signatures, in particular echo tops, while those in winter/spring storms are not. The locations of largest flash densities in winter/spring storms were found to be correlated with areas of high <b>reflectivity</b> or large <b>gradients</b> in <b>reflectivity</b> and not so much with areas with tall echo tops, while for summer storms, the correlation is seen with areas having tall cloud tops. Finally, summer multi-cell and winter/spring frontal storms in North-Central Florida are compared to storms in different geographical regions. Some differences are: (1) larger range of initiation altitudes of ICs and -CGs in North-Central Florida summer storms than in the literature, (2) colder isotherms for initiation altitudes of most ICs in North-Central Florida summer storms than in Japan, and (3) not much lightning in the stratiform region in winter/spring frontal storms in North-Central Florida, unlike frontal storms characterized in the other geographical regions.
