5|$|The multifidus muscles <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{along the}} back of the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E
25|$|This led Johnson and Smith to {{note that}} Bavetta, a {{physically}} fit referee whose job required him to <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the court on a nightly basis, would likely beat Barkley in a race. Bavetta challenged Barkley to a footrace, which was then scheduled for the upcoming All-Star Weekend.|$|E
25|$|Another main {{factor is}} the tension placed on the ligaments that support the navicular bone. Some experts believe that the {{degenerative}} process begins with excess tension placed on these ligaments, causing strain and inflammation. Inflammation from strain of the impar ligament can decrease blood flow {{to and from the}} navicular bone, as the major blood vessels supplying the bone <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> this area. If the ligament continues to be strained, it can thicken and permanently reduce blood flow to the navicular bone.|$|E

25|$|On June 18, 1864, in the Battle of Lynchburg, Early's {{combined}} forces, though outnumbered, repelled Union General Hunter's troops. Lynchburg's defenders {{had taken}} pains {{to create a}} false impression that the Confederate forces within the city were much larger. For example, a train was continuously <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the tracks while drummers played and Lynchburg citizens cheered as if reinforcements were disembarking. Local prostitutes {{took part in the}} deception, misinforming their Union clients of the large number of Confederate reinforcements. Narcissa Owen, wife of the President of the Lynchburg and Tennessee Railroad, later wrote about her similar deception of Union spies.|$|E
500|$|Up to [...] in diameter, the cap is convex to {{flattened}} {{in shape}} {{with a central}} umbo (a rounded elevation) and is various shades of cream, yellow and tan. The cap surface is covered with darker scales and feels rough to the touch. The cap edge, or margin, is rolled inward in young specimens. The crowded gills are [...] and white to cream in colour initially, brownish-cream or pinkish brown in maturity, and sometimes with yellow or rust-coloured marks close to the margins. The stem is central (that is, it joins the cap in the centre) and is up to [...] long by [...] thick. It is slightly thicker at its base than its apex, sometimes almost bulb-like. The stem surface is streaked with fibrils that <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> its length. It has a floppy yellow wool-like ring which may develop irregular, jagged edges with time. The flesh is white, and in the stem has a woolly or stringy consistency. Although it has a hot-bitter taste, Armillaria luteobubalina is edible, and cooking removes the bitterness.|$|E
2500|$|The club's first-ever Football League game {{took place}} on 5 September 1896, at Lincoln City. The fact that the game took place at all is notable in itself, because it took the Blackpool team six hours to travel what was just a [...] journey. The players, {{directors}} and club doctor caught the 7am train from Blackpool North and endured a journey via Manchester and Birmingham. They had to change trains on two occasions, with the players' only exercise being a <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the platform.|$|E

2500|$|According to the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, [...] "Jolson was to jazz, blues, and ragtime what Elvis Presley was to rock 'n' roll." [...] Being {{the first}} popular singer {{to make a}} {{spectacular}} event out of singing a song, he became a rock star before the dawn of rock music. His specialty was performing on stage runways extending out into the audience. He would <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the runway, and across the stage, [...] "teasing, cajoling, and thrilling the audience", often stopping to sing to individual members; all the while the [...] "perspiration would be pouring from his face, and the entire audience would {{get caught up in}} the ecstasy of his performance". According to music historian Larry Stempel, [...] "No one had heard anything quite like it before on Broadway." [...] Author Stephen Banfield agreed, writing that Jolson's style was [...] "arguably the single most important factor in defining the modern musical".|$|E
2500|$|The herpetologist Laurence Monroe Klauber proposed, in a tongue-in-cheek article which blames Dr. Watson {{for getting}} {{the name of the}} snake wrong, a theory that the swamp adder was an {{artificial}} hybrid between the Mexican Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and Naja naja. His speculation suggests that Doyle might have hidden a double-meaning in Holmes' words. What Holmes said, reported by Watson, was [...] "It is a swamp adder, the deadliest snake in India"; but Klauber suggested what Holmes really said was [...] "It is a samp-aderm, the deadliest skink in India." [...] Samp-aderm can be translated [...] "snake-Gila-monster": Samp is Hindi for snake, and the suffix aderm is derived from heloderm, the common or vernacular name of the Gila monster generally used by European naturalists. Skinks are lizards of the family Scincidae, many of which are snake-like in form. Such a hybrid reptile will have a venom incomparably strengthened by hybridization, assuring the almost instant demise of the victim. And it will also have ears like any lizard, so it could hear the whistle, and legs and claws allowing it to <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the bell cord with a swift ease.|$|E
2500|$|The incline {{from floor}} 5 to floor 9 was [...] long, with a {{gradient}} of 1 in 1.97 {{at the top}} and 1 in 2.15 at the bottom. It follows the roof of the vein, and the change in slope is caused by the dip of the vein changing. A cradle running on standard gauge tracks <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the incline. It was counterbalanced by a weighted truck running on [...] gauge tracks, running down the centre of the incline. The counterbalance passed under the main cradle, which carried trucks on three transverse tracks, at the midway point. At the bottom of the incline, the cradle descended into a pit, to that its top was level with the floor, to enable the loaded trucks to be off-loaded easily. Sometime after the construction of this incline, a similar one was built between floors 3 and 6 {{in the western part of}} the mine. It sloped down at 1 in 1.26, and was [...] long. From about 1890, the mine began to be extended below level 9, for which a new incline was needed. It ran from near the foot of the 5/9 incline, and descended at a gradient of 1 in 2.48 for a distance of about [...] to reach floor 14. It was probably powered by a counterbalance system, since another incline was constructed from the head of the 9/14 incline up to floor 6. It was too small for it to have housed a transporter truck, but could easily have been used by a balancing truck, which would have been filled with water at floor 6 to make it heavy enough to raise the transporter on the 9/14 incline, and emptied for movement in the reverse direction. No details of it have survived, and power was provided by two Pelton wheels on floor 9 from 1899, which were supplied with water from the abandoned adit on floor 4.|$|E
