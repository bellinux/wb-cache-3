40|$|The {{international}} relations literature currently lacks a systematic study of <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaty</b> ratifications. This is surprising given the apparent {{rapid increase in}} the number of <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> in the past century. <b>Multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> also offer one of best means of measuring international cooperation in the international system. This study seeks to fill this gap in the literature by examining the rates at which states have ratified what I call universal <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> over the period of 1911 to 2011. Universal <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> are <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> open to ratification by all members of the international system. This study shows that states have ratified these types of treaties at an increasing rate, which suggests that international cooperation has markedly increased in the past one hundred years. This study also examines potential causes of this increase, including the spread of peace and democracy. It concludes with a discussion of the tendency of newly independent states to ratify large numbers of these treaties during their formative years...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> have {{again become}} a central vehicle for {{international}} cooperation. In this article, we study states’ commitment to 76 <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> concluded between 1990 and 2005. The article offers a systematic account of present-day multilateral treaty-making efforts and asks what explains variation in states’ participation as witnessed in the act of treaty ratification. We test existing explanations and provide a novel argument that accounts for the strong participation of new European democracies in <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties.</b> We find that regime type and being part of the European Union (EU) strongly affect treaty ratification. New EU democracies, in particular, {{are much more likely to}} ratify <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> than are other new democracies...|$|R

40|$|In the State {{practice}} {{regarding the}} declarations of {{acceptance of the}} International Court's compulsory jurisdiction one can trace some disputed reservations containing proviso which under­mine the obligation assumed regarding the Court's compulsory jurisdiction. One of the limita­tions is called reservation concerning <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaty,</b> otherwise known as the Vanden­berg reservation or <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaty</b> reservation. The article treats these reservations by examining their origin, contents and Court's juris­prudence on the matter. According to the author the <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaty</b> reservations have destructive effect on the com­pulsory jurisdiction system, chiefly because the broad conception of interpretation of the “affected” States bars proceedings before the Court over disputes as to <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> concluded by a larger group of States, if not all the States party to the treaty are also parties in the proceedings before the Court. As for {{the other part of}} the reservation, that stipulation virtually invalidates the obligations assumed in declarations of acceptances, since it hampers the Court to deal with a dispute submitted to it unless the State making such a reservation in its decla­ration or, on the basis of reciprocity, the adverse party has agreed to the Court's jurisdiction. The adverse effect of the reservation is all the more so since the <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaty</b> reservations expressly concern disputes with regard to treaty interpretation, and considerable part of the cases brought before the Court concern precisely such disputes...|$|R

40|$|Who {{supports}} <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> and who doesn’t? We offer {{a systematic}} account of treaty ratification patterns paying {{particular attention to}} different states’ roles in international legal cooperation {{in relation to the}} United States’ ratification behavior. We argue that states’ ability to influence the terms of treaties and their acceptance increases their incentives for <b>treaty</b> ratification. <b>Multilateral</b> powers – states which are powerful and independent from the US – support multilateral legal cooperation because this offers them an opportunity to shape treaty content. Their engagement in <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> is strongest when the United States does not lead. Other states that are weak and/or dependent cannot greatly affect treaties and are therefore less supportive of them but are subject to US pressure. An empirical analysis of states’ decisions to ratify prominent postwar <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties</b> covering a wide range of global issues supports our argument. We conclude with broader implications for future international cooperation...|$|R

40|$|Why do new EU democracies {{engage in}} multilateralism? The {{dominant}} explanation proposes that new democracies use international treaties {{to lock in}} domestic reforms. This article offers a novel explanation as to why new EU democracies participate in <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties.</b> We argue that ratifying a treaty serves three external signaling purposes (addressing recognition concerns; increasing strategic autonomy, and pleasing the EU). We test our argument through a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. First, we apply event history analysis. Drawing on a new ratification data set comprising 76 <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties,</b> we illustrate the prominent role of new EU democracies in multilateralism as compared to other new democracies. Second, to assess the importance of external signaling {{in the decision to}} ratify <b>multilateral</b> <b>treaties,</b> we examine parliamentary ratification debates in selected Central and Eastern European countries. Third, we compare parliamentary discussions across European and non-European new democracies to demonstrate the different motives driving their approaches toward multilateralism...|$|R
