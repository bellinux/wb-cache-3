25|$|Crustal {{extension}} {{controls the}} tectonic accommodation space available for sediments in rift settings {{and may be}} defined by the structural and depositional geometry of sedimentary successions observed on seismic data and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> through time as represented by the accommodation of sediment. The characteristic features of each are dependent on three variables: the time taken for deposition; the interplay between tectonics and eustasy and the lithology (thus facies) of the succession observed. The Sherwood Sandstone Group has been considered to represent a syn-rift phase of fluvial deposition throughout Europe, with the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group interpreted as the succeeding phase of deposition in an evaporitic seaway during post-rift thermal subsidence. More recently, however, there has been the recognition {{that it is the}} Mercia Mudstone Group which is seen to thicken markedly into faults imaged on seismic data rather than the Sherwood Sandstone Group. This work demonstrates the Mercia Mudstone Group to be a syn-rift phase of deposition, with the fine grained nature of the sedimentary record at this time controlled by the prevailing arid climate. Such conditions were not conducive to the large-scale and rapid movement of sediments from the hinterlands raised by relative footwall uplift, thus the sediments are fine grained. The minor thickening of the Sherwood Sandstone Group into faults is interpreted to be a combination of minor extension in the early Triassic superimposed on thermal subsidence inherited from the important regional phase of extension in the early Permian. Analysis of the timing of fault growth indicates a larger proportion of fault-controlled, synsedimentary movement occurred during the mid-to-late Triassic (Mercia Mudstones) rather than the early Triassic (Sherwood).|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Science of the Total Environment and the definitive published version is available at [URL] paper presents a numerical analysis of pluvial flooding to evaluate the impact <b>of</b> land <b>subsidence</b> on flood risks in urban contexts using a hydraulic model (FloodMap-HydroInundation 2 D). The pluvial flood event of August 2011 in Shanghai, China is used for model calibration and simulation. Evolving patterns of inundation (area and depth) are assessed over four time periods (1991, 1996, 2001 and 2011) for the downtown area, given local changes in topography and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> land <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> up to 27 mm/yr. The results show that land subsidence can lead to non-linear response of flood characteristics. However, the impact on flood depths is generally minor (< 5 cm) and limited to areas with lowest-lying topographies because of relatively uniform patterns <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> and micro-topographic variations at the local scale. Nonetheless, the modelling approach tested here may be applied to other cities where there are more marked <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> and/or greater heterogeneity in the depressed urban surface. In these cases, any identified hot-spots <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> and focusing <b>of</b> pluvial flooding may be targeted for adaptation interventions...|$|R
60|$|We may, I think, safely {{conclude}} that sediment must be accumulated in extremely thick, solid, or extensive masses, {{in order to}} withstand the incessant action of the waves, when first upraised and during subsequent oscillations of level. Such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment may be formed in two ways; either, in profound depths of the sea, in which case, judging from the researches of E. Forbes, we may {{conclude that}} the bottom will be inhabited by extremely few animals, and the mass when upraised will give a most imperfect record of the forms of life which then existed; or, sediment may be accumulated to any thickness and extent over a shallow bottom, if it continue slowly to subside. In this latter case, {{as long as the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> and supply of sediment nearly balance each other, the sea will remain shallow and favourable for life, and thus a fossiliferous formation thick enough, when upraised, to resist any amount of degradation, may be formed.|$|E
60|$|The {{vast amount}} of subsidence, both {{horizontally}} or in area, and vertically or in depth, necessary to have submerged every mountain, even the highest, throughout the immense spaces of ocean interspersed with atolls, will probably strike most people as a formidable objection to my theory. But as continents, {{as large as the}} spaces supposed to have subsided, have been raised above the level of the sea,--as whole regions are now rising, for instance, in Scandinavia and South America,--and as no reason can be assigned, why subsidences should not have occurred {{in some parts of the}} earth's crust on as great a scale both in extent and amount as those of elevation, objections of this nature strike me as of little force. The remarkable point is that movements to such an extent should have taken place within a period, during which the polypifers have continued adding matter on and above the same reefs. Another and less obvious objection to the theory will perhaps be advanced from the circumstance, of the lagoons within atolls and within barrier-reefs never having become in any one instance during prolonged subsidences of a greater depth than sixty fathoms, and seldom more than forty fathoms; but we already admit, if the theory be worth considering, that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> has not exceeded that of the upward growth of the coral on the exterior margin; we are, therefore, only further required to admit, that the subsidence has not exceeded in rate the filling up of the interior spaces by the growth of the corals living there, and by the accumulation of sediment. As this filling up must take place very slowly within barrier-reefs lying far from the land, and within atolls which are of large dimensions and which have open lagoons with very few reefs, we are led to conclude that the subsidence thus counter-balanced, must have been slow in an extraordinary degree; a conclusion which accords with our only means, namely, with what is known of the rate and manner of recent elevatory movements, of judging by analogy what is the probable <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence.</b>|$|E
60|$|We may, I think, {{conclude}} that sediment must be accumulated in extremely thick, solid, or extensive masses, {{in order to}} withstand the incessant action of the waves, when first upraised and during subsequent oscillations of level, {{as well as the}} subsequent subaerial degradation.

Or sediment may be deposited to any thickness and extent over a shallow bottom, if it continue slowly to subside. In this latter case, as long as the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> and supply of sediment nearly balance each other, the sea will remain shallow and favourable for many and varied forms, and thus a rich fossiliferous formation, thick enough, when upraised, to resist a large amount of denudation, may be formed.|$|E

30|$|Three system tracts HST, LST, and TST were {{recognized}} and mapped at the XAN- 01 well (Fig.  6). HSTs occur between 12, 632 – 11, 652 and 10, 343 – 9650 -ft intervals. HSTs {{are characterized by}} intervals of coarsening and shallowing upwards, with both fluvial and deltaic sands {{near the top of}} the unit prograding laterally into neritic shales (Posamentier and Allen 1999; Posamentier et al. 1991). In the studied wells, the HST intervals are very thick and this can be attributed to high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence,</b> high sediment input, and instability associated with a slow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> sea level rise.|$|R
30|$|The {{structural}} and stratigraphic settings {{of the field}} are mainly controlled by pre- and syn-sedimentary tectonic elements that responded to variable <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> and sediment supply during Late Eocene to Oligocene times (Doust and Omatsola 1990; Reijers 2011). Structurally, the macrostructures found in the area, according to Evamy et al. (1978); Stacher (1995); Reijers (2011), range from simple rollover anticlines, multiple growth faults, antithetic faults and collapsed crest faults (Fig.  2 c) with most of these faults offsetting at {{different parts of the}} Agbada Formation and flattening into Eocene detachment planes {{near the top of the}} Akata Formation (Reijers et al. 1997).|$|R
60|$|I may first observe, {{that the}} reefs within the lagoons of atolls and within lagoon-channels, would, if favourably circumstanced, grow upwards during {{subsidence}} {{in the same}} manner as the annular rim; and, therefore, we might expect that such lagoon-reefs, when not surrounded and buried by an accumulation of sediment more rapid than the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence,</b> would rise abruptly from a greater depth than that at which the efficient polypifers can flourish: we see this well exemplified in the small abruptly-sided reefs, with which the deep lagoons of the Chagos and Southern Maldiva atolls are studded. With respect to the ring or basin-formed reefs of the Northern Maldiva atolls, it is evident, from the perfectly continuous series which exists that the marginal rings, although wider than the exterior or bounding reef of ordinary atolls, are only modified portions of such a reef; it is also evident that the central rings, although wider than the knolls or reefs which commonly occur in lagoons, occupy their place. The ring-like structure has been shown to be contingent on the breaches into the lagoon being broad and numerous, so that all the reefs which are bathed by the waters of the lagoon are placed under nearly the same conditions with the outer coast of an atoll standing in the open sea. Hence the exterior and living margins of these reefs must have been favourably circumstanced for growing outwards, and increasing beyond the usual breadth; and they must likewise have been favourably circumstanced for growing vigorously upwards, during the subsiding movements, to which by our theory the whole archipelago has been subjected; and subsidence with this upward growth of the margins would convert the central space of each little reef into a small lagoon. This, however, could only take place with those reefs, which had increased to a breadth sufficient to prevent their central spaces from being almost immediately filled up with the sand and detritus driven inwards from all sides: hence it is that few reefs, which are less than half a mile in diameter, even in the atolls where the basin-like structure is most strikingly exhibited, include lagoons. This remark, I may add, applies to all coral-reefs wherever found. The basin-formed reefs of the Maldiva Archipelago may, in fact, be briefly described, as small atolls formed during subsidence over the separate portions of large and broken atolls, {{in the same manner}} as these latter were formed over the barrier-reefs, which encircled the islands of a large archipelago now wholly submerged.|$|E

50|$|The Hawaiian Trough, {{otherwise}} known as the Hawaiian Deep, is a moat-like depression of the seafloor surrounding the Hawaiian Islands.

40|$|A {{combined}} volcanological, geochemical, paleo-oceanological, geochronological and {{geophysical study}} was undertaken on the Kurile Basin, {{in order to}} constrain the origin and evolution of this basin. Very high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> were determined for the northeastern floor and margin of the Kurile Basin. Dredged volcanic samples from the Geophysicist Seamount, which were formed under subaerial or shallow water conditions but are presently located at depths in excess of 2300 m, were dated at 0. 84 ± 0. 06 and 1. 07 ± 0. 04 Ma with the laser 40 Ar/ 39 Ar single crystal method, yielding a minimum average <b>subsidence</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 1. 6 mm/year for the northeast basin floor in the Quaternary. Trace element and Sr–Nd–Pb isotope data from the volcanic rocks show evidence for contamination within lower continental crust and/or the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, indicating that the basement presently at ∼ 6 -km depth is likely to represent thinned continental crust. Average <b>subsidence</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> 0. 5 – 2. 0 mm/year were estimated for the northeastern slope of the Kurile Basin during the Pliocene and Quaternary through {{the determination of the}} age and paleo-environment (depth) of formation of sediments from a canyon wall. Taken together, the data from the northeastern part of the Kurile Basin indicate that subsidence began in or prior to the Early Pliocene and that subsidence rates have increased in the Quaternary. Similar <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> have been obtained from published studies on the Sakhalin Shelf and Slope and from volcanoes {{in the rear of the}} Kurile Arc. The recent stress field of the Kurile Basin is inferred from the analysis of seismic activity, focal mechanism solutions and from the structure of the sedimentary cover and of the Alaid back-arc volcano. Integration of these results suggests that compression is responsible for the rapid <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> the Kurile Basin and that subsidence may be an important step in the transition from basin formation to its destruction. The compression of the Kurile Basin results from squeezing of the Okhotsk Plate between four major plates: the Pacific, North American, Eurasian and Amur.

5000|$|Before the {{formation}} of the basin, the area that encompasses the Los Angeles basin began above ground.

50|$|Above the Pre-Neogene {{sequence}} lies a major unconformity, overlain {{by early}} Miocene rocks. This unconformity {{is the result}} of the area being subjected to subaerial erosion, but then was followed by a marine transgression, which deposited the overlaying Miocene rocks. This transgression originally deposited near-shore sands, followed by shallow water siltstones. Towards the middle Miocene, the region developed into a carbonate shelf, and these carbonates make up the rest of this sequence. During the late Miocene, these carbonates were buried by large quantities of clastic sediments originating from the uplift of Sumatra during this time. These sediments deposited faster than the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> in the region, creating a continental shelf and slope in the west of the basin. The newly formed continental slope deposited turbidites over the early-middle Miocene sediment that the shelf did not cover. This Sequence is about 1000 meters thick. After the middle Miocene, there lies an unconformity which represents a ~10 million year depositional hiatus.|$|E
40|$|Bohai Bay Basin, {{located in}} eastern China, is {{considered}} a Cenozoic rifted basin. The basin is atypical {{in terms of its}} Neogene–Quaternary postrift subsidence history in that it experienced intensive tectonic reactivation, rather than the relative tectonic quiescence experienced during this stage by most rift basins. This Neogene–Quaternary tectonic reactivation arose principally in response to two tectonic events: (1) activity on a dense array of shallow faults and (2) accelerated tectonic subsidence that occurred during the postrift stage. These two events were neither strictly temporally nor spatially equivalent. The dense array of shallow faults form a northwest–southeast-trending belt in {{the central part of the}} basin, with displacement induced by the reactivation of older northeast- and northwest-trending basement faults and an associated substantial component of strike-slip displacement occurring after 5. 3 Ma. The intensive reactivation of these faults contributed to the atypically accelerated <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> postrift tectonic <b>subsidence</b> <b>of</b> the basin that commenced ca.. However, this was not the sole cause of this accelerated tectonic subsidence: A combination of geological activity deep within the crust led to the buildup of intraplate stresses, and this, combined with ongoing thermal subsidence, acted as an additional contributory factor that drove unusually high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence</b> for this basin.

40|$|Land {{subsidence}} {{resulting from}} groundwater extractions {{is a global}} phenomenon adversely affecting many regions worldwide. Understanding the governing processes and mitigating associated hazards require knowing the spatial distribution of the implicated factors (piezometric levels, lithology, ground deformation), usually only known at discrete locations. Here, we propose a methodology based on the Kriging with External Drift (KED) approach to interpolate sparse point measurements of variables influencing land subsidence using high density InSAR measurements. In our study, located in the Alto Guadalentín basin, SE Spain, these variables are GPS vertical velocities and the thickness of compressible soils.

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{model is}} used to investigate the relationship between land <b>subsidence</b> and compaction <b>of</b> basin sediments in response to sediment loading.

But as the lowest part of the basin with the greatest <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidence,</b> the escarpment margin experiences {{the highest rates of}} sedimentation, which may accumulate to several kilometers in depth.This sedimentation often includes very coarse debris such as huge blocks from rock falls, as well as fans of sediment from the basin wall.

50|$|The {{onset of}} {{volcanism}} within the basin, {{the beginning of}} the volcanic synrift phase, was also the foundation of the Nahe Subgroup.

This drowning of cratons during the latest Neoproterozoic-Cambrian could have brought about major taphonomic changes.

40|$|A spherical {{model of}} mantle flow {{constrained}} by the locations of trenches {{can be used to}} predict the dynamic topography of the Earth's surface, and hence the marine inundation of continents. For past periods of high sea level, the predicted geographical pattern of flooding correlates well with the geological record. The high spatial correlation may result from increased plate velocities at these times, leading to increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> subduction, <b>subsidence</b> and inundation at convergent margins...|$|R
