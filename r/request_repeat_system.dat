40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a simple yet effective method for designing nested families of LDPC codes. Rate compatible codes {{are essential for}} many communication applications, e. g. hybrid automatic <b>repeat</b> <b>request</b> (HARQ) <b>systems,</b> and their design is nontrivial due {{to the difficulty of}} simultaneously guaranteeing the quality of several related codes. Puncturing can be used to generate rate-compatible LDPC codes, but it produces a gap to capacity that, in practice, often significantly exceeds the gap of the mother code. We propose an alternative method based on successively extending a high-rate protograph. The resulting codes not only inherit the advantages of protograph codes, namely low encoding complexity and efficient decoding algorithms, but also cover a wide range of rates and have very good performance with iterative decoding thresholds that are within 0. 2 dB of their capacity limits.

The paper focuses {{on the construction of}} efficient rate-compatible low-density parity-check (RC-LDPC) codes over a wide range of rates. Two LDPC code families are considered; namely, regular LDPC codes which are known for good performance and low error floor, and semi-random LDPC codes which offer performance similar to regular LDPC codes with the additional property of linear-time encoding. An algorithm for the design of punctured regular RC-LDPC codes that have low error floor is presented. Furthermore, systematic algorithms for the construction of semi-random RC-LDPC codes are proposed based on puncturing and extending. The performance of a type-II hybrid ARQ system employing the proposed RC-LDPC codes is investigated.

40|$|Abstract — Incremental-redundancy hybrid {{automatic}} repeatrequest (IR-HARQ) schemes {{are proposed}} in several wireless standards for increased throughput-efficiency and greater reliability. We investigate transmit power and modulation order adaptation {{strategies for the}} IR-HARQ schemes over correlated Rayleigh fading channels using semi-Markov decision processbased model. In order to jointly analyze physical layer and link layer, transmitter model incorporates a finite-size buffer that receives randomly varying traffic from a higher layer application. It is assumed that channel variations can be modeled with a firstorder Markov chain. We show that the optimal transmission power and rate adaptation laws under buffering delay and packet overflow constraints can be obtained using the framework of semi-Markov decision process. We discuss three different adaptation models for the IR-HARQ schemes and compare their performances with the non-adaptive scheme. It is shown that unique optimal policy exists for each case {{and it can be}} computed using linear programming approach. This optimal policy is then applied for realistic channel fading and incoming traffic samples to evaluate its performance for both hard-decision and softdecision decoding. Simulation results in general point out that substantial power savings can be achieved using adaptation and also if the transmission-delay requirements are relaxed.

40|$|Abstract — We {{address the}} issue of optimal coding rate {{scheduling}} for adaptive type-I hybrid automatic <b>repeat</b> <b>request</b> wireless <b>systems.</b> In this scheme, the coding rate is varied depending on channel, buffer and incoming traffic conditions. In general, we consider the hidden Markov model for both time-varying flat fading channel and bursty correlated incoming traffic. It is shown that the appropriate framework for computing the optimal coding rate allocation policies is partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In this framework, the optimal coding rate allocation policy maximizes the reward function, which is a weighted sum of throughput and buffer occupancy with appropriate sign. Since polynomial amount of space is needed to calculate the optimal policy even for a simple POMDP problem, we investigate maximum-likelihood, voting and Q-MDP policy heuristic approaches for the purpose of efficient and real-time solution. Our results show that three heuristics perform close to completely observable system state case if the fading and/or traffic state mixing rate is slow. On the other hand, when the channel fading is fast, Q-MDP heuristic is the most throughput-efficient among considered heuristics. Also, its performance is close to the optimal coding rate allocation policy of fully observable system state case.

40|$|In this paper, a two-user {{superposition}} modulated cooperative relay hybrid automatic <b>repeat</b> <b>request</b> (HARQ) <b>system</b> is proposed. Two {{mobile station}} (MS) uplink communications {{to the base}} station (BS) with cooperative assistance of a relay station (RS) are considered. The RS {{is assumed to be}} able to perfectly monitor and decode the two MS-to-BS transmitted packets and assist the two MSs by immediately transmitting a cooperative superposition modulated packet that combines the two MS generated packets in the analog domain. The BS is assumed to have perfect channel statistical information and can feed back the appropriate superposition weighting factor to the RS regularly. The HARQ retransmissions, if needed, are then jointly performed by the RS for both MSs instead of separately for each MS. The superposition of the modulated packets is repeatedly retransmitted by the RS to the BS if needed. With the foregoing setting, we derive an information-theoretic achievable rate region and an approximation of the system outage probability. Based on the high SNR behaviors of the approximated system outage probability, we obtain the superposition weighting factor using a simple and efficient searching algorithm. We also analytically derive the HARQ system throughput as the performance metric for comparison. Compared with the traditional relaying HARQ system, our proposed scheme exhibits more than 30 % gain in terms of system throughput, depending on the fading statistics of the RS-to-BS and MS-to-BS channels...|$|R
