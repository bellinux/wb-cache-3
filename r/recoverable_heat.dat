Recovering this thermal energy can be used to decrease the CO 2 footprint of the water cycle. This paper describes the development of a model to simulate the heat balance and predict the temperature in a sewer system. The model can be used to estimate the recoverable thermal energy and its dynamics. The model was verified with field data. It was concluded that the model is a powerful and accurate tool to simulate the heat balance of a sewer system at the urban district level. It was found that the <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat</b> show highly dynamic patterns, directly related to water consumption patterns.

40|$|In {{programs}} such as BLAST and DOE– 2, the Double Bundle Electric Chiller model uses fixed input values for determining the <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat</b> component. The drawback {{of this approach is}} no dependence on system demands, plant, and cooling tower loads. Determining the availability or gradation (quality of heat) of the <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat,</b> is a subjective user input, and independent of the flow rates and temperatures. In a program like EnergyPlus, the plant and heat recovery equipment is now connected with loops having mass flow rates and temperatures, allowing for a more sophisticated simulation. Execution speed still restricts the chiller simulation to empirical models that give the total condenser heat as an output for the cooling tower and heat recovery loops. A new algorithm that bases the <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat</b> fraction on the flow rates and inlet temperatures has been developed. This algorithm uses relatively simple inputs to determine the fraction of the heat recovered and the heat rejected by the cooling tower. The variations in the mass flow rates and temperatures in the simulation are now used to obtain more realistic heat transfer rates of each component. This paper presents an analysis of the new algorithm for determining the heat recovery factor, and presents examples showing its performance and advantages of this model over the simple model. The electric chiller in EnergyPlus now has the option of having its condenser hooked up to a heat recovery loop, or what is commonly known as a double bundled chiller...|$|E
40|$|During the {{generation}} of steam, most water impurities are not evaporated with the steam and thus concentrate in the boiler water. The concentration of the impurities is usually regulated by the adjustment of the continuous blowdown valve, which controls {{the amount of water}} (and concentrated impurities) purged from the steam drum. Since a certain amount of continuous blowdown must be maintained for satisfactory boiler performance, a significant quantity of heat is removed from the boiler. It is necessary to provide a simple-to-use method to calculate the total amount of <b>heat</b> that is <b>recoverable</b> using this system. In the present work, a simple-to-use predictive tool, which is easier than existing approaches, less complicated with fewer computations and minimize the complex and time-consuming calculation steps, is formulated to arrive at an appropriate estimation of the percent of blowdown that is flashed to steam as a function of flash drum pressure and operating boiler drum pressure followed by the calculation of the amount of <b>heat</b> <b>recoverable</b> from the condensate. Since all of the heat in the flashed steam is recoverable, the total percent of <b>heat</b> <b>recoverable</b> from the flash tank and heat-exchanger system is calculated in the final step.

40|$|The {{last step}} in the {{production}} of milk powder is drying, an energy intensive process that demands 30 % to 40 % of the total energy input of a typical plant. It takes place in Spray Dryers (SD), where concentrated milk is sprayed and placed in direct contact with hot and dry air that cools down and gains humidity as water is evaporated from milk. The warm and humid air leaving the SD contains a small portion of potentially <b>recoverable</b> sensible <b>heat</b> and a large portion of latent heat that is impractical to recover by direct condensation due to the low dew point of this stream and due to the presence of milk powder particles that become sticky at high relative humidity values. In this research, the thermodynamic feasibility of a liquid sorption system for the recovery of heat from the exhaust of SD’s was investigated. The system proposed has two main advantages: the dehumidification of air in the absorber for reuse in the SD, and the production of medium pressure steam in the regenerator for integration to the steam network of the plant. A mathematical model was implemented in Matlab, and two system configurations were evaluated. The calculations showed that a SD equipped with this system can achieve energy savings between 58 % and 99 % when using aqueous solutions of phosphoric acid as liquid desiccant depending on the system configuration. The challenge with this liquid desiccant remains on the construction materials. Engineering Thermodynamic...|$|R

However, little has been done on optimal design of the storage tank. For application in dense living environment like Hong Kong, another concern is whether or not the amount of <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat</b> can meet the household water heating demand. In this study, a typical residential estate in Hong Kong was chosen for supply and demand analysis. The analysis was based on hour-by-hour simulations using actual building characteristics and previously identified utilization patterns. It was found that with the use of SEHRAC, the daily cumulative <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat</b> far exceeds the daily household water heating demand. For optimal design of the storage tank, an air-conditioner model (REFMOD) was developed to enable ascertaining the operating parameters at the refrigerant side of SEHRAC.

40|$|It is {{generally}} known that dry etching induces surface damage, but {{the structure of}} etched surfaces has not been studied in detail.

Generally, etching damages the surface by introducing structural disorder and impurities to the surface region. Such damage may be so severe that a clean, ordered surface is not <b>recoverable</b> even after <b>heating</b> up to ∼ 1400 K in UHV. We subjected Si (1 1 1) surfaces to different reactive ion etching conditions and/or post-etch treatments and examined their effect on the surface.

40|$|The {{effect of}} inlet design on the {{performance}} of storage-type domestic electrical water heaters (EWHs) was experimentally investigated for energy conservation. Three different side-inlet geometries; namely wedged, perforated, and slotted pipe-inlets; were tested using two 50 Â L capacity EWHs of aspect ratios 1 and 2 and two discharge rates 5 and 10 Â L/min. The three inlet designs are successful in promoting good thermal stratification inside the storage tanks of the EWHs. However, the degree of mixing produced by each design is found to have a significant impact {{on the performance}}. Thermal performance is quantified in terms of discharge efficiency, extraction efficiency, and fraction of <b>heat</b> <b>recoverable.</b> The results show an excellent performance for the slotted inlet. Although performance measures of perforated inlet are slightly less, the slotted inlet is attractive as it is simpler to manufacture and the extra cost associated with adopting it inside the existing EWH models is justified by the substantial savings in electricity and water consumptions, which ultimately concern the users.

40|$|In this study, {{the heat}} {{recovery}} from exhaust gas at the ACE Power Embilipitiya (Pvt) Ltd (APE) in Sri Lanka was conceptually proposed and evaluated. APE has an installed capacity of 100 MW comprising 14 units of 7. 5 MW medium speed diesel engines fired with heavy fuel oil. There {{is only a}} minimum recovery of waste heat in the plant at the moment, only for fuel preheating, whereas waste heat recovery (WHR) boilers of 750 kWth are equipped on eight engines. The larger portion of the waste heat is dumped into the environment without being used in any reasonable way. The objective of this work was to design a HRSG system for the remaining six engines to recover maximum possible heat from the exhaust gas and select a suitable steam turbine according to the heat demand capacity of the proposed HRSG, for generating additional power and thus converting the APE plant {{into a sort of}} a combined cycle. At the initial stage of the investigation, the amount of <b>recoverable</b> waste <b>heat</b> was estimated by evaluating the known parameters of the engines at fully loaded condition. The maximum theoretical waste heat recovery potential from the exhaust gas stream of one engine was calculated as 9807. 87 MJ/h, equivalent to a heat rate of 2724. 4 kW. The modelling and optimization of the proposed HRSG was done using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software, considering technical and practical limitations such as pinch point temperature difference, approach point temperature difference, terminal temperature difference and sulphur dew point in the stack. A commercially available steam turbine with a power output of 3. 579 MW was selected as the optimum steam turbine for the desired conditions, utilising 12884. 4 MJ/h of recovered waste energy amounting to 21. 89 % of the total available energy in the flue gas...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of geothermal resource assessment methodology {{is the development of}} geothermal resource models consistent with the production histories of exploited geothermal fields. The primary method applied in past United States Geological Survey (USGS) assessments was the volume method, in which the <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat</b> is estimated from the thermal energy available in a reservoir of uniformly porous and permeable rock using a constant recovery factor, Rg, of 0. 25 for the producible fraction of a reservoir’s thermal energy. More recent analyses of data from the fractured reservoirs commonly exploited for geothermal energy indicate that Rg is closer to 0. 1, with a range of approximately 0. 05 to 0. 2. In general this apparent discrepancy in Rg reflects the contrast in thermal energy recovery from complex, fracture-dominated reservoirs compared to the uniform, high-porosity reservoirs considered in the early models. Models for the recovery of heat from heterogeneous, self-similar, fractured reservoirs predict variations in Rg that provide a physically realistic basis for evaluating the production potential of both natural geothermal reservoirs and reservoirs that may be created through the application of EGS technology...|$|E

The power generation efficiency of BECCS can be improved by using heat recovered from flue gas to supply energy requirements of the solvent regeneration process. This paper assesses the influence of solvent selection and biomass co-firing proportion on <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat,</b> energy efficiency and carbon intensity of a 500 MW pulverized fuel BECCS system. The effects of (i) coal type (high and medium sulphur content), (ii) biomass type (wheat straw and clean wood chips, (iii) variable moisture content, and (iv) biomass co-firing % on AFT and emissions of SOX and NOX was evaluated. Compared to firing of coal alone, co-firing low moisture biomass generated higher adiabatic flame temperature. As biomass co-firing proportion increased, SOX emissions decreased, whereas NOX emissions increased with greater AFT. Factors that enhanced BECCS efficiency included the use of high performance solvents and higher heat recovery (higher AFT and flue gas flow rate).

40|$|The article unveils {{the mystery}} of cogeneration. Cogeneration is an add-on or {{embedded}} activity in thermal power plants, with as merit the use of part or whole of their point source heat exhausts. EU's talk of “high-efficiency cogeneration” is an unfounded transfer of responsibility from the hosting {{thermal power generation plant}} onto CHP (Combined Heat & Power) activity. The quality of a CHP activity is univocally defined by its design power-to-heat ratio σ, a tombstone parameter derived from the design characteristics of the power plant. A thermal power plant may house more than one cogeneration activity. Identifying σ requires positioning the bliss point in the electricity–heat production possibility set of the cogeneration activity. The bliss point is where after electric output is maximized, the sum of that output and the maximum <b>recoverable</b> quantity of <b>heat</b> occurs.

40|$|Growing {{awareness}} {{and interest in}} renewable resources has raised the need to homogenise the reporting requirements for geothermal resources {{so that they can}} be applied worldwide. As no globally agreed standards, guidelines or codes exist, there remains too much latitude in geothermal assessment, which leads to increased resource uncertainty, more investment risk and less confidence in development. Reconciling the various reporting of geothermal resources is a major challenge as it is difficult to define what the target actually is: the source, the reservoir, the fluids, the stored heat, the recoverable volume, the <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat,</b> the recoverable power, or the net profit. Formulating an agreed procedure to classify geothermal resources is further complicated by changing environmental, policy and regulatory constraints around the globe. Present day techniques of computing geothermal resources provide only ballpark estimates at best.

Interestingly, increasing the size of the fuel cell up to a certain level above the minimum required actually lowers the average unit cost of energy supplied since the fuel cell operates at lower current densities and hence better efficiency. A smaller PV array, electrolyser and hydrogen tank are then required as well.

40|$|Effectiveness of SEHRAC (storage-enhanced heat {{recovery}} room air-conditioner) for water heating in residential buildings in Hong Kong and elsewhere {{has been confirmed}} in previous studies. However, given these studies assumed a theoretical maximum <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat,</b> whether its use is still energy effective in practice, in particular under intermittent operation, is of concern. Intermittent operation of the SEHRAC can lead to significant fluctuations in operating conditions. Adding that capillary tube is often used as the expansion device to magnify the fluctuations, whether SEHRAC can still operate satisfactorily despite the fluctuations is another concern.

40|$|The energy {{consumption}} is continuous to increase {{around the world}} and with that follows the demand for sustainable solutions for future energy systems. With growing {{energy consumption}} from fossil based fuels the threat of global warming through release of CO 2 to the atmosphere increases. The demand for cooling is also growing which would result in an increased consumption of electricity if the cooling demand was to be fulfilled by electrically driven cooling technology. A more sustainable solution can be to use heat-driven absorption cooling where waste heat may be used as driving energy instead of electricity. This thesis focuses on the role and potential of absorption cooling in future energy systems. Two types of energy systems are investigated: a district energy system based on waste incineration and a distributed energy system with natural gas as fuel. In both cases, low temperature waste heat is used as driving energy for the absorption cooling. The main focus is to evaluate the absorption technology in an environmental perspective, in terms of reduced CO 2 emissions. Economic evaluations are also performed. The reduced electricity when using absorption cooling instead of compression cooling is quantified and expressed as an increased net electrical yield. The results show that absorption cooling is an environmentally friendly way to produce cooling as it reduces the use of electrically driven cooling in the energy system and therefore also reduces global CO 2 emissions. In the small-scale trigeneration system the electricity use is lowered with 84 % as compared to cooling production with compression chillers only. The CO 2 emissions can be lowered to 45 CO 2 /MWhc by using <b>recoverable</b> waste <b>heat</b> as driving heat for absorption chillers. However, the most cost effective cooling solution in a district energy system is a combination between absorption and compression cooling technologies according to the study. Absorption chillers have the potential to be suitable bottoming cycles for power production in distributed systems. Net electrical yields over 55 % may be reached in some cases with gas motors and absorption chillers. This small-scale system for cogeneration of power and cooling shows electrical efficiencies comparable to large-scale power plants and may contribute to reducing peak electricity demand associated with the cooling demand.

However, these greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming and are likely to be banned by European directives. Some interest is now turned towards fluids with low global warming potential (GWP) like carbon dioxide. The performances of CO 2 can be interesting in transcritical cycles, particularly for domestic hot water (DHW) production. However, this cycle requires the use of devices operating under high pressures. The Heating and Cooling Plant (HCP) is intended to produce domestic hot water and to heat and cool residential and small office buildings. The HCP presents an innovative design of the refrigeration circuit and an innovative defrosting system. It is equipped with three heat exchangers: a water condenser (or gas cooler for transcritical CO 2) and a water evaporator linked to three tanks and an air heat exchanger that can be either condenser or evaporator in order to balance productions and needs. When operating with the air evaporator under frosting conditions, some heat is gained by subcooling the refrigerant and stored in the cooling tank. When the cold tank is hot enough the HCP mode changes, to work with the water evaporator while the air evaporator is being defrosted. Two HCPs (CO 2 and HFC) have been modelled using TRNSYS and EXCEL. The simulations enable to estimate the performances of both machines and to construct a frosting - defrosting sequence.

It forms {{part of a}} collaborative "Bridging the Urban Rural Divide" (BURD) research group across the United Kingdom and India investigating rural sustainable development through the provision of renewable electricity. The group is tasked with improving the educational environment and healthcare of a 45 household community (which {{is part of a}} larger village) in West Bengal, India. Working in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay as part of this thesis, a projected daily electrical demand for the community of 55 kW∙h per day was calculated, providing: lighting, fans and an electrical device charging station. To allow in excess of the daily electrical demand as well as for system ancillaries at 12 kW∙h, solar trackers at 14 kW∙h and 7 kW∙h for hydrogen production, a power plant producing 90 kW∙h was specified. This included daily electricity production of 70 kW∙h during the daytime from solar via a 10 kW concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) system and 20 kW∙h in the evening from a 5 kW biogas and hydrogen internal combustion engine electrical generator (genset). The biogas is produced from anaerobic digestion of food waste and aquatic weeds, and the hydrogen is produced from the electrolysis of water in an electrolyser powered by excess solar power. An energy and exergy analysis identified the daily quantity and quality of <b>recoverable</b> waste <b>heat</b> sources at 25 °C. These are the CPV with an energetic value of 109 kW∙h and an exergetic value of 32 kW∙h at 60 °C and the genset radiator with an energetic value of 32 kW∙h and an exergetic value of 5 kW∙h at 80 °C. The exhaust heat from the genset has been allocated for other uses and, though calculated, is outside the scope of this research. The thesis then focusses on using these low temperature waste heat sources for absorption refrigeration. The working fluids selected are acetone and zinc bromide as these had been proven in the literature to operate at temperatures below those of the expected waste heat sources without the need for rectification (the process of separating two fluid vapours from each other). Due to the local climate with high ambient temperatures, averaging 24 °C to 35 °C, and the relatively low waste heat source temperatures, a number of configurations of absorption refrigerator were investigated to achieve lower, and therefore more versatile, evaporator temperatures. Some of these involve utilising some of the cooling produced from either or both of the heat sources to cool the absorber and condenser. The findings were that the most energy effective way of providing low evaporator temperatures was to use a small (2...|$|R

Effects of {{the different types of}} input distributions, correlation among input variables and cognitive biases are also investigated. Both Monte Carlo (MC) and the analytic uncertainty propagation (AUP) methods are considered and compared for uncertainty characterization. Analytic uncertainty propagation equations (AUPEs) are derived based on a Taylor-series expansion around the mean values of the input variables. The AUPEs are general in that correlation among the input variables, if it exists, can also be accounted for on the resulting uncertainty. Monte Carlo methods (MCMs) were used to verify the results obtained from the AUPEs. A comparative study that we have conducted shows that the AUPM is as accurate as the MCM for the problem of interest. We show that AUPM {{can be used as a}} fast tool, without resorting to the MCM because the resulting distributions of stored and <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat</b> are always log-normal, which makes it possible for the results of the AUPM to accurately characterize the uncertainty.

The results of the experiment indicate that up to 37 % of the thermal energy used by a shower can be recovered with the system developed in this study.

Austenite to martensite phase transformation can be obtained by mechanical (loading) and thermal methods (heating and cooling). During martensitic transformation, no diffusive process is involved, only inelastic deformation of the crystal structure. When the shape memory alloy passes through the phase transformation, the alloy transforms from high ordered phase (austenite) to low ordered phase (martensite). There are two types of martensite transformations. First is temperature-induced martensite, which is also called self-accommodating (twinned) martensite. The second is stress-induced martensite, also called detwinned martensite. The entire austenite to martensite transformation cycle can be described with four characteristic temperatures: M s – martensite start temperature, Mf – martensite finish temperature, As – austenite start temperature, and Af – austenite finish temperature. The main factors influencing transformation temperatures are chemical composition, heat treatment procedure, cooling speed, grain size, and number of transformation cycles. As a result of martensitic transformation in SMAs, several thermomechanical phenomena may occur: pseudoelasticity, shape memory effect (one-way and two-way SME) and rubber-like behavior. Pseudoelasticity occurs when the SMA is subjected to a mechanical loading at a constant temperature above Af. The second thermomechanical behaviour that can be observed in SMA is the shape memory effect (SME), mainly one-way SME, which is the most commonly used SME. When the sample is subjected to a mechanical loading, the stress reaches a critical value and the transformation of twinned martensite into detwinned martensite begins and finishes when the loading process is finished. When the loading-unloading process is finished, the SMA presents a residual strain <b>recoverable</b> by alloy <b>heating,</b> which induces the reverse phase transformation. As a result, the alloy recovers to its original shape. In this paper, a review of thermomechanical properties of shape memory alloys and general characteristics of martensite transformations is shown...|$|R

Utilisation of low temperature process heat from capture plant, {{air separation unit}} or CO 2 compression in district heating system and/or industrial solutions offers significant potential to increase overall efficiency and feasibility of CCS processes. The effects of CCS on the local CHP systems were included within the studied system boundaries in order to evaluate the economics and emissions from investor's (local energy company) point of view. Effect of CCS on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and operation economics of the CCS cases are compared to the reference system with varying parameters of operation. Regarding the GHG emissions, besides the site emissions, the main effects on global GHG emissions are also taken into account by using system modeling and streamlined LCA. In the case studies the whole CCS chain, including CO 2 capture, processing, transport and storage, was included. Carbon capture processes were modeled using Aspen Plus and Prosim process modeling software and the results were used in CCS plant economics toolkit (CC-Skynet™) to estimate CO 2 emission reduction possibilities and carbon abatement costs. Studied case studies included three main applications which were studied in different operational situations. The properties of reference plants and CHP systems are based on the real operational CHP units and steel mill in Finland. The first presented application is retrofit of about 1000 MWfuel CHP plant with post combustion capture technology. Natural gas fired GTCC plant is part of relatively large district heating network including also other CHP units in the same network. The plant is situated on the coastal area of Southern Finland and it emits approximately 1. 3 Mtn CO 2 /year. The second application is a greenfield about 500 MWfuel CHP plant situated on the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia and emitting approximately 1. 5 Mtn CO 2 /year. The plant is based on a modern CFB-boiler which is equipped with oxy- fuel technology in the CCS case. The studied fuel-shares with and without CCS consisted of pure biomass, pure peat and biomass-peat co-firing. In the study it is assumed that the economic incentive for negative CO 2 emission is included in EU ETS for Bio-CCS. The plant is connected to the existing district heating network where older CHP plant already exists. Another plant and limited district heat consumption in the area limits the benefits obtained from CCS heat recovery. The third application is an integrated steel mill situated on the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia and emitting approximately 4. 0 Mtn CO 2 /year altogether. The mill is retrofitted for post combustion capture and implications of different capture amounts, different solvents and process integration levels are compared to the base case steel production with varying operational parameters. Process heat is utilized also as district heat but heat consumption in the district heat network is smaller than the amount of <b>recoverable</b> process <b>heat</b> in the mill. The results showed that significant improvements can be achieved by CHP in plants utilizing CCS, {{especially in the case of}} oxy-fuel. The feasibility of CCS is heavily dependent not only on the characteristics of the facility and the operational environment but also on the chosen system boundaries and assumptions. In combined heat and power plants, major improvements can be obtained with heat integration, especially, in the production of district heat. In the near future particularly large, new and flexible CHP plants, which can burn coal, biomass or peat, are seen as promising candidates for CCS in Finland...|$|R
40|$|Treating {{water in}} order to reduce human and {{environmental}} risks requires the use of electricity and chemicals, the generation of which creates emissions of air pollutants such as NOx, SO 2, PM 2. 5, and CO 2. Emissions of air pollutants establishes a health and environmental risk tradeoff between air and water pollution. Addressing air-water tradeoffs by adopting a one environment framework requires new methods for quantifying these tradeoffs, new technologies to minimize air-water tradeoffs, and new tools for decision makers to incorporate these tradeoffs into compliance decisions. In my thesis, I develop methods for quantifying damages from air emissions associated with water treatment; assess the feasibility of forward osmosis (FO), a technology which holds the promise to avoid air-water tradeoffs; and create a tool to holistically assess compliance with air and water emission standards for coal-fired power plants (CFPPs). I start my thesis by creating a method to quantify the damages caused by the air emissions that resulting from the treatment of drinking water (Chapter 2), municipal wastewater (Chapter 3), and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater (Chapter 4). These studies use life-cycle models of energy and chemical consumption for individual water treatment unit processes {{in order to}} estimate embedded emissions of criteria air pollutants and greenhouse gasses per cubic meter of treated water. Damages from these additional air emissions are assessed and incorporated into benefit-cost analyses. I find that for drinking water rules, the net benefit of currently implemented rules remains positive but the promises of net benefits for some proposed rules are conditional on the compliance technology that is selected. For municipal wastewater, I find that while there are ~$ 240 million (in 2012 USD) benefits in air emission reduction from installing biogas-fueled electricity generation nationwide, there are several states where biogas-fueled electricity creates more air emissions than it displaces. For FGD wastewater treatment, I find that complying with the effluent limitation guidelines has an expected ratio of benefits to cost of 1. 7 - 1. 8, with damages concentrated in regions with large chemical manufacturing industries or electricity grids that are heavily reliant on coal. In the next part of the thesis, I assess the techno-economic feasibility of power plant waste heat driven FO to reduce the air emissions associated with FGD wastewater treatment. In Chapter 5, I assess the quantity, quality and the spatial and temporal availability of waste heat from US coal, nuclear, and natural gas power plants. I find that while 18. 9 billion GJ of potentially <b>recoverable</b> waste <b>heat</b> is discharged into the environment, only 900 million GJ of that heat is from the flue gas and is at a temperature high enough to drive water purification using forward osmosis (FO). In Chapter 6, I build a model of FO to assess its thermal energy consumption and find that the 900 million GJ of waste heat produced at coal and natural gas power plants is sufficient to meet their boiler feedwater and FGD wastewater treatment needs. In Chapter 7, I incorporate cost into the energy consumption model of FO, and conclude that treatment of FGD and gasification wastewater using waste heat driven FO is economically competitive with mechanical vapor recompression. In Chapter 8, I create an energy-balance model of a CFPP and nine environmental control technologies for compliance with FGD wastewater and carbon capture regulations. I use this model to maximize plant revenue at the National Energy Technology Laboratory’s 550 MW model CFPP without carbon capture. I find that revenue is maximized by using residual heat for water treatment or carbon capture. If both carbon capture and zero liquid discharge water treatment regulatory standards are in place, I conclude that the plant maximizes revenue by allocating residual heat and steam to amine-based carbon capture and electricity to mechanical vapor recompression for FGD wastewater treatment...|$|R

It builds from the wealth of deep subsurface data from {{oil and gas exploration}} and production which is publicly and digitally available. In the resource assessment various performance indicator maps have been produced for direct heat applications (greenhouse and spatial heating). These maps are based on detailed mapping of depth, thickness, porosity, permeability, temperature and transmissivity (methodology presented in other papers in this NJG issue). In the resource assessment analysis 14 lithostratigraphic units (clastic aquifers) have been considered, ranging in age from the Permian to the Cenozoic. Performance maps have been made which include a) the expected doublet power (MWth) to be retrieved; b) the number of houses or hectares that can be heated from one doublet; and c) a potential indicator map, which provides insight in subsurface suitability for specific applications from a techno-economic perspective. To obtain a nationwide overview of the resource potential in terms of recoverable geothermal energy, a progressive filtering approach was used from total heat content of the reservoirs (Heat In Place – HIP) via the heat that can potentially be recovered (Potential Recovery Heat – PRH) to energy maps taking into account a techno-economic performance evaluation (<b>Recoverable</b> <b>Heat</b> – RH). Results show that the HIP is approximately 820, 000 PJ which is significantly more than previous estimates of around 90, 000 PJ. This considerable increase in geothermal energy potential is the result of accurate geological mapping of key reservoir properties and the development of state-of-the-art techno-economic performance assessment tools that performs Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, for the previous estimates boundary conditions were set with the aim to compare the geothermal potential between different EU countries (Rijkers & Van Doorn, 1997). Taking into account techno-economic aspects, the RH is in the order of 85, 000 PJ. This is equivalent to 70...|$|E

H 577 P BSE 2016 Jiaxxii, 157 pages :illustrations (some color) In {{subtropical}} climates such as Hong Kong's, air-conditioning {{and domestic}} water heating are two dominant energy end-uses in residential buildings. Local {{statistics show that}} out of the total energy consumption of the residential sector, 23 % goes to air-conditioning and 19 % goes to water heating. These figures clearly show that a technology that can simultaneously reduce energy use for space cooling and water heating is highly valuable. Water heating utilizing condenser heat rejected from a refrigeration cycle is considered to be an energy efficient measure for domestic hot water production due to the associated heating efficiency is always higher than unity. On this basis, heat pump water heater is widely investigated for use in residential buildings. However, a majority of previous studies focused only on its heating capacity at the condenser. The cooling performance at the evaporator under various operation conditions was seldom studied. This is because heat pump water heaters are often used as stand-alone water heating appliances with evaporator leaving air discharged to outdoors and thus the associated cooling effect is unexploited. Economic barrier also exists to limit its use in residential buildings, since a considerable investment must be made in the heat pump by the user. Therefore, a technology that allows a room air-conditioner to serve the combined purpose of space cooling and water heating is preferred, {{due to the fact that}} air-conditioners are commonly equipped in Hong Kong households to combat the hot and humid summer. However, considering the differences between a heat pump and a room air-conditioner, relevant research works are limited in public domain. In view of this, a storage-enhanced heat recovery room air-conditioner (SEHRAC) was proposed. Besides space cooling, this installation can also provide water heating utilizing recovered condenser heat. In this study, the effectiveness, energy performance, operation characteristics, and performance improvement of SEHRAC when used for combined space cooling and water heating were investigated. For the application of SEHRAC, a major concern is whether or not the amount of <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat</b> can meet the household water heating demand. The concern is particularly prominent in Hong Kong because most local residential units are small but the occupancy density is high (average living space is 12. 9 m²/person). The small space cooling load and thus the small amount of <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat</b> may not be sufficient to offset the high water heating demand. To address the concern, a typical residential estate in Hong Kong was chosen for a supply and demand analysis. The analysis was based on hour-by-hour simulations using actual building characteristics and realistic equipment performance data. It was found that if a water tank was used for thermal energy storage, the daily cumulative <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat</b> far exceeded the daily household water heating demand, confirming the effective use of SEHRAC in Hong Kong. Further, for optimal design of the water tank of SEHRAC, its design requirements including the minimum required heat storage capacity and heat transfer effectiveness were also determined and discussed. Room air-conditioners are often sized for satisfying peak cooling loads. At part load conditions, most air-conditioners operate intermittently to regulate their cooling outputs for maintaining the indoor set-point temperature. Intermittent operation of SEHRAC can lead to significant fluctuations in operating parameters on the refrigerant side. Adding that capillary tube is often used as the expansion device to magnify the fluctuations, whether SEHRAC can still operate satisfactorily in practice is of concern. Further, as operation of SEHRAC is affected by outdoor temperature and space cooling load, their influences on the energy performance of SEHRAC also need to be ascertained. In view of this, a prototype SEHRAC was designed and setup for laboratory experiments. The experimental results confirmed the satisfactory operation of SEHRAC. Its overall coefficient of performance (COP) was also found better than conventional room air-conditioner for a range of outdoor temperatures and space cooling load conditions. On this basis, a prediction model was developed for evaluating the sole use of SEHRAC for water heating in the entire air-conditioned season. The potential water heating energy saving on wider application of SEHRAC was estimated to be 9. 1 % of the overall energy consumption of the residential sector in Hong Kong. Considering the significant refrigerant pressure fluctuations during the operation of SEHRAC, the selection of a suitable type of expansion device that can function properly despite the fluctuations is very important. In this study, the use of capillary tube (CT) and thermostatic expansion valve (TEV) in SEHRAC were side-by-side compared with the aim of optimizing the system configuration of SEHRAC. A prototype SEHRAC, which could be switched between the CT and TEV systems, was used for two identical sets of experiments. For each set of experiments, a series of tests under different outdoor temperatures were conducted. It was found that TEV could better regulate the refrigerant flow, maintain a stable evaporator superheat, and minimize the rise in refrigerant vapor content at the evaporator inlet during the operation of SEHRAC. The space cooling and water heating capacities for the TEV system were on average 16. 3 % to 19. 4 % and 18. 5 % to 23. 4 %, respectively, larger than the CT system. Its overall COP was also found 12. 5 % to 20. 9 % higher for the range of outdoor temperatures. Accumulation of heat in the water tank of SEHRAC can result in an increase in tank water temperature, which will unavoidably affect the space cooling and water heating performances of SEHRAC. Measures to enhance the heat storage capacity of the water tank will thus be beneficial to the overall performance of SEHRAC. For achieving this objective, the use of phase change material (PCM) in the water tank was proposed in this study. To confirm and quantify the resultant performance improvement, laboratory experiments were conducted with and without the use of PCM (abbreviated as wPCM and woPCM scenarios). It was confirmed that the PCM could function as an internal heat sink to lower the rate of water temperature increase and to enhance the heat storage capacity of the water tank. As a result, the space cooling and water heating capacities for the wPCM scenario, as compared to the woPCM scenario, were 5. 4 % and 16. 1 % larger, respectively. The overall COP was therefore found 6. 9 % to 9. 8 % higher. It was also revealed that the use of PCM could extend the heat retention time of the tank water by 21. 1 %. From the above, the academic contributions of this thesis can be summarized into four aspects. First, the effectiveness of SEHRAC in satisfying the daily space cooling and water heating demands of Hong Kong households was confirmed. Second, the energy performance and operation characteristics of SEHRAC in comparison with conventional room air-conditioner under different outdoor temperatures and space cooling load conditions were examined. Third, the system configuration of SEHRAC was optimized by identifying a suitable type of expansion device. Last, the use of PCM to improve the overall performance of SEHRAC was proposed and confirmed. Department of Building Services EngineeringPh.

About one-third of the fuel energy is released from the exhaust manifolds of the diesel engines and normally is not captured for useful applications. This project studied different waste heat applications that may effectively use the heat released from exhaust of Alaskan village diesel generators, selected the most desirable application, designed and fabricated a prototype for performance measurements, and evaluated the feasibility and {{economic impact of the}} selected application. Exhaust flow rate, composition, and temperature may affect the heat recovery system design and the amount of heat that is recoverable. In comparison with the other two parameters, the effect of exhaust composition may be less important due to the large air/fuel ratio for diesel engines. This project also compared heat content and qualities (i. e., temperatures) of exhaust for three types of fuel: conventional diesel, a synthetic diesel, and conventional diesel {{with a small amount of}} hydrogen. Another task of this project was the development of a computer-aided design tool for the economic analysis of selected exhaust heat recovery applications to any Alaskan village diesel generator set. The exhaust heat recovery application selected from this study was for heating. An exhaust heat recovery system was fabricated, and 350 hours of testing was conducted. Based on testing data, the exhaust heat recovery heating system showed insignificant effects on engine performance and maintenance requirements. From measurements, it was determined that the amount of heat recovered from the system was about 50 % of the heat energy contained in the exhaust (heat contained in exhaust was evaluated based on environment temperature). The estimated payback time for 100 % use of recovered heat would be less than 3 years at a fuel price of $ 3. 50 per gallon, an interest rate of 10 %, and an engine operation of 8 hours per day. Based on experimental data, the synthetic fuel contained slightly less heat energy and fewer emissions. Test results obtained from adding different levels of a small amount of hydrogen into the intake manifold of a diesel-operated engine showed no effect on exhaust heat content. In other words, both synthetic fuel and conventional diesel with a small amount of hydrogen may not have a significant enough effect on the amount of <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat</b> and its feasibility. An economic analysis computer program was developed on Visual Basic for Application in Microsoft Excel. The program was developed to be user friendly, to accept different levels of input data, and to expand for other heat recovery applications (i. e., power, desalination, etc.) by adding into the program the simulation subroutines of the desired applications.

Shape memory alloys (SMAs) {{belong to}} a group of functional materials with the unique property of “remembering” the shape they had before pseudoplastic deformation. Such an effect is based on crystallographic reversible thermo-elastic martensitic transformation. There are two crystal phases in SMAs: the austenite phase (stable at high temperature) and the martensite phase (stable at low temperature). Austenite to martensite phase transformation can be obtained by mechanical (loading) and thermal methods (heating and cooling). During martensitic transformation, no diffusive process is involved, only inelastic deformation of the crystal structure. When the shape memory alloy passes through the phase transformation, the alloy transforms from high ordered phase (austenite) to low ordered phase (martensite). There are two types of martensite transformations. First is temperature-induced martensite, which is also called self-accommodating (twinned) martensite. The second is stress-induced martensite, also called detwinned martensite. The entire austenite to martensite transformation cycle can be described with four characteristic temperatures: Ms – martensite start temperature, Mf – martensite finish temperature, As – austenite start temperature, and Af – austenite finish temperature. The main factors influencing transformation temperatures are chemical composition, heat treatment procedure, cooling speed, grain size, and number of transformation cycles. As a result of martensitic transformation in SMAs, several thermomechanical phenomena may occur: pseudoelasticity, shape memory effect (one-way and two-way SME) and rubber-like behavior. Pseudoelasticity occurs when the SMA is subjected to a mechanical loading at a constant temperature above Af. The second thermomechanical behaviour that can be observed in SMA is the shape memory effect (SME), mainly one-way SME, which is the most commonly used SME. When the sample is subjected to a mechanical loading, the stress reaches a critical value and the transformation of twinned martensite into detwinned martensite begins and finishes when the loading process is finished. When the loading-unloading process is finished, the SMA presents a residual strain <b>recoverable</b> by alloy <b>heating,</b> which induces the reverse phase transformation. As a result, the alloy recovers to its original shape.

In {{order to make}} underground mining production, large amounts of outdoor air must be pushed down to the mining level. At the LKAB facility in Kiruna this is done {{by a number of}} mining ventilations stations. The air has to be heated before it is transported down to the mining levels. This is done in order to prevent icing in the shaft. Today, the heating of the air is done by using waste heat from the pellet mills and if extra heating is needed, due to lower outdoor air temperatures, oil is used. The exhaust air from the underground is moist and warm. It is therefore interesting to investigate if it is possible to install a heat exchanger in the mine ventilation stations and use the heat in the exhaust air to heat the supply air. The heat recovery system which has been investigated in this study is a type of coil heat exchanger. Heat exchanger manufacturer has submitted a proposal on the type of coil heat exchanger that could withstand the specic demands and oer a price for the system. The chosen heat recovery system has four supply exchangers with the size 4500 x 2000 mm and 3 exhaust exchangers with size 8000 x 2200 mm. Each Supply air coil had a power of 661 kW and each exhaust exchanger was sized at 882 kW. Analyses were made to estimate reductions in the use of oil by implementing the heat recovery system. In addition, also the amount of waste heat energy that could be saved by installing the heat exchangers was calculated. The calculations were carried out on a total of 9 mining ventilation stations. The energy that the rst installed station could save in form of oil during a year has been estimated to 4, 7 GWh. If heat exchangers were installed in all the 9 stations the energy reduction would be approximately 29 GWh per year. The energy that could be saved at station 1 in the form of waste heat was 0. 6 GWh per year. If heat exchangers were installed at all the 9 stations, the <b>recoverable</b> waste <b>heat</b> was calculated to be approximately 18 GWh per year. The nancial analyses were made for two cases. One that was based only on prots from the saved oil and, the other also by selling of the saved waste heat to TVAB. The total installation cost per station was estimated at to around 4. 3 million skr. Considering the saved amount of oil the payback time for a single station was found to be approximately 1. 4 years. For all the 9 stations the payback time was estimated to be 3. 6 years. If sale of waste heat is included and added to the analysis, the payback time for a single ventilation station is 1, 4 years and for an installation in all the stations the payback time is 2, 4 years. The problems that could arise are due to contamination, which could be prevented by greater spacing of the battery heat exchangers and protective coating with Heresite. Expansion of the exhaust duct must also be made when the exhaust air coils are too big to t in the available channel. The calculations are based on the assumptions that the temperature of the exhaust air is 8. and the relative humidity is 100 % in all stations. The same kind of coil heat exchanger has therefore been used in the calculation of the dierent stations. In the next design step it is proposed that more accurate values for each station are provided to the heat exchanger manufacturer to improve design performance of the recovery system. A futher recommendation is that the rst installation of the heat exchange system should be implemented in ventilation station KV 10 where there is plenty of space available for a heat exchanger system, and KV 10 also has the second highest exhaust air temperature...|$|R
40|$|In Italy {{and many}} European {{countries}} energy production from biomass is encouraged by strong economic subsidies so that renewable energy plants, anaerobic digestion plant producing biogas in particular, are getting large diffusion. Nevertheless, {{it is necessary}} to define the environmental compatibility as well as technological and economic issues dealing with the emerging renewable energy scenario. This evaluation should take into account global parameters as well as environmental impacts at regional and local scale coming from new polluting emissions. The environmental balances regarding new energy plants are of primary importance within very polluted areas such as Northern Italy where air quality limits are systematically exceeded, in particular for PM 10, NO 2 and ozone. The most important environmental shortcomings that should be solved or at least minimized as far as biogas production and utilisation are concerned are: 1. macro-pollutants emissions from biogas engine at the local scale and low fuel utilization index (biogas plants generally don't recover all thermal energy at disposal); 2. indirect GHG emissions, mainly involving post-methanation emissions from the digestate storage; 3. ammonia emissions from the storage and land spreading of digested materials, low fertilising efficiency of manure and digestate, nitrate contamination of groundwater. The described emissions and energy inefficiency could involve negative environmental balances at the local scale, conflicting with the possible benefits arising from biomass energy production. An alternative technological choice for biogas valorisation could be biomethane production (also called green gas) through biogas purification and upgrading processes in order to remove CO 2 and trace components. Biomethane production and its injection into natural gas grid (or its use as a transport vehicle fuel) could bring about strong energy and environmental benefits such as higher energy efficiencies and lower specific emissions (district heating CHP units, combined cycle gas turbines, methane powered vehicles). The present study mainly aims at analysing biogas upgrading techniques under the aspects of energy consumptions and environmental sustainability, with a specific focus on minimizing methane losses from the process by means of suitable design and operative choices (temperature, pressures, sorbents, recirculation strategies, etc.) that are fully described and simulated. The considered upgrading techniques are based on the principles of physical and chemical absorption and pressure/vacuum swing adsorption (PSA). The analysis highlights that there are strong differences among the examined upgrading techniques, as far as specific sorbent flows, absorbing tower dimensions, methane losses, power required, <b>recoverable</b> <b>heat</b> and environmental impacts (use of resources, gaseous releases of odorous and polluting molecules, GHG balances) are concerned. In particular, all the analysed upgrading techniques could be designed in order to achieve very low methane slip, below 0. 1 %, except PSA for which methane losses are hardly reducible below 2 %, even at very high energy consumptions. The actual range of methane slip for the considered technologies is 0. 1 ÷ 5 % whereas the energy consumption to upgrade biogas lies in the range 0. 05 ÷ 0. 54 kWhe/m 3 of raw biogas. The following analysis reports also some economic evaluations including electric energy costs, thermal energy requirements, biomethane sale incomes and external costs due to environmental impacts of biogas production+upgrading techniques. Within the described cost-benefit approach, the best overall balances seems to be assured by absorption with DEPG and chemical absorption with MEA. Finally, {{the last part of the}} present work shows a technical analysis of a specific digestate treatment process that could help reaching both the reduction of GHG and ammonia emissions and, at the same time, the production of fertilizers. The present analysis therefore confirms that biogas/biomethane technology is absolutely ready and suitable to reach very high levels of productivity, efficiency and environmental performances at sustainable costs and the right technological approach could solve many environmental problems regarding nitrate contamination of groundwater, ammonia emissions and global warming issue...|$|E
