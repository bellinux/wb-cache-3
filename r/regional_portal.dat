40|$|Objective To {{analyze the}} {{efficacy}} of endoscopic histoacryl injection {{in the treatment of}} gastric variceal bleeding caused by <b>regional</b> <b>portal</b> hypertension. Methods The endoscopic features and efficacy of endoscopic histoacryl injection were examined and compared in two groups of patients admitted to our hospital from June 2012 to December 2012. One of the groups included 6 patients with gastric variceal bleeding caused by <b>regional</b> <b>portal</b> hypertension and the other group included 6 patients with gastric variceal bleeding caused by hepatitis B cirrhosis-related portal hypertension. Between-group comparison of categorical data was made by Fisher′s test. Results In patients with <b>regional</b> <b>portal</b> hypertension, five of them had severe isolated gastric varices (IGV) and one had severe IGV with mild esophageal varices. All six patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis-related portal hypertension had severe IGV and the endoscopic features were similar to those of patients with <b>regional</b> <b>portal</b> hypertension. Significant differences were observed between the group with <b>regional</b> <b>portal</b> hypertension and the group with hepatitis B cirrhosis related portal hypertension in short-term response rate (1 / 6 vs 6 / 6, P= 0. 015) and long-term response rate (0 / 6 vs 5 / 6, P= 0. 015).

40|$|Objective 　To {{establish}} the animal model of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) on living swine liver, and observe the pathologic changes {{caused by the}} "river effect (RE) "of RFA on relevant regional hepatocytes. Methods 　Three target segments of liver of each of 6 Guangxi BA-MA mini pigs were selected for ablation. Under the guidance of sonography, the tip of RFA electrode was inserted into the liver close to segmental outflow vessel, and every ablated point was heated for 6 minutes. Pathological changes of relevant downstream region along portal vein and hepatic artery were observed under microscope after RFA. Results 　The ablated region of the liver was oblong in shape with outer diameter of 2. 2 ± 1. 1 cm on gross inspection. Thermal damage (e. g. obvious dilated blood sinuses, with abundant inflammatory cell infiltration in portal vein region and necrosis of hepatocytes, etc.) was observed in downstream region of the relevant portal vein under microscope after RFA. However, liver tissue in adjacent area around the vessel was intact, and no obvious thermal damage was found. Conclusion 　The "river effect" during RFA for liver tissue may lead to thermal damage to hepatocytes along the downstream region of the <b>regional</b> <b>portal</b> vein, and this effect decreases gradually toward the surface of liver segment...|$|E

For instance, we evaluated if web portal provides: online publications, multilingual access, GIS, calendar of events, searchable database of articles, accommodation reservation etc. For evaluation of <b>regional</b> web <b>portals,</b> we chose two regional touristic headquarters (Centrála cestovního ruchu [...] Jižní Morava (www. ccrjm. cz), Jihočeská centrála cestovního ruchu www. jccr. cz)), one regional touristic web (Posázaví - vítejte v turistickém regionu kolem řeky Sázavy (www. posazavi. com)), two Austrian web portals, which represents cross-border cooperation between Austria and Czech republic (Urlaub am Bauerhof [...] dovolená na selském statku (www. agroturistika-v-rakousku. cz), Rakousko [...] přijeďte a ožijete (www. austria. info/cz)) and official touristic web portal of Switzerland (Officielle Website von Schweiz Tourismus (www. mojesvycarsko. com)). As it turned out during our model usage, which took into account five important areas, level of <b>regional</b> web <b>portals</b> significantly differ. Some criteria are fulfilled across the all sites, but some of them are partly or completely missing. Individual solutions therefore often prefer different criteria, thus providing different perspectives on the region and its issues. If all criteria were met, the informational content and thus even usefulness of the individual portals would rise. Theoretically, this would lead to a "content compatibility" of individual solutions, which would ultimately bring profit to users and consequently the visitors of their respective regions...|$|R
