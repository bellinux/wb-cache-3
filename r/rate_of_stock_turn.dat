40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a survey conducted to test the hypothesis that the use <b>of</b> increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> and fertilizer could lead to increased production on dairy farms in South Taranaki. Increases in stocking rates and fertilizer rates had been taking place on some farms in the South Taranaki area for several seasons preceding the 1961 - 62 season. Farmers making these increases suggested that other management changes were necessary when increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> and fertilizer were used. These changes, when taken together, were thought to lead to increases in production. Thus the specific aim of the survey was to find a well proven management system incorporating increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> and fertilizer, and to evaluate this system in physical and financial terms. No attempt was made to find the best management system for increasing production since this attempt would have been defeated by the important differences between farms and between farmers. Rather, the aim was to fully document one management system so that the uncertainty associated with its adoption by farmers would be reduced. Should farmers feel that there are management systems superior to the one evaluated in this study, then it is to be hoped that a demand for further research will arise. [From Introduction...|$|R

40|$|While fuzzy specialists usually use {{homogeneous}} experts’ {{knowledge to}} construct fuzzy models, {{it is much}} more difficult to deal with knowledge elicited from a heterogeneous group of experts. This issue especially holds {{in the area of the}} sustainable rangeland management. One way to deal with the diversity of opinions is to develop a fuzzy system for all experts and to combine all these so-called primary systems into one multi-fuzzy model. To derive each of the primary fuzzy systems using the knowledge of a group of administrative experts, several semi-structured interviews were held in three different areas of the Fars province in Southwest Iran. In order to find the final output of the multi-fuzzy model, we applied different ‘voting’ methods. The first method simply uses the arithmetic average of the primary outputs as the final output of the multifuzzy model. This final output represents an estimation <b>of</b> the Right <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Stocking.</b> We also propose other (un) supervised voting methods. Most importantly, by harmonizing the primary outputs such that outliers get less emphasis, we introduce an unsupervised voting method calculating a weighted estimate <b>of</b> the Right <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Stocking.</b> This harmonizing method is expected to provide a new useful tool for policymakers in order to deal with heterogenity in experts’ opinions: it is especially useful in cases where little field data is available and one is forced to rely on experts’ knowledge only. By constructing the three fuzzy models based on the elicitation of heterogeneous experts’ knowledge, our study shows the multidimensional vaguenesses that exist in sustainable rangeland management.
