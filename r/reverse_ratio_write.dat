30|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a method to obtain more arithmetic-geometric mean inequalities and the reverse version for {{positive}} operators. In Section  2, we introduce the main lemmas. In Section  3, utilizing the refined Young inequality and iteration method, we establish some weighted arithmetic-geometric mean inequality for two positive operators. We also obtain <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> type and difference type inequalities for positive operators by means of iteration under different conditions in Section  4 and Section  5, respectively.|$|R

40|$|Because at {{the tree}} level B_s→ K^+K^- is Cabibbo-triple suppressed, so its {{branching}} ratio should be smaller than that of B_s→π^+ K^-. The measurements present a <b>reversed</b> <b>ratio</b> as R= B(B_s→π^+K^-) / B(B_s→ K^+ K^-) ∼ 4. 9 / 33. Therefore, It {{has been suggested that}} the transition B_s→ K^+K^- is dominated by the penguin mechanism, which is proportional to V_cbV^*_cs. In this work, we show that an extra contribution from the final state interaction (FSI) to B_s→ K^+K^- via sequential processes B_s→ D^(*) _(s) D̅_s^(*) → K^+K^- is also substantial and should be superposed on the penguin contribution. Indeed, taking into account of the FSI effects, the theoretical prediction on R is well consistent with the data. Comment: 9 pages, 1 figures, 3 tables. Accepted by PR...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. When using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to {{optimize}} the feature space of pattern classification problems, the performance improvement is not only determined by the data set used, but also depends on the classifier. This work compares the improvements achieved by GA-optimized feature transformations on several simple classifiers. Some traditional feature transformation techniques, such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) are also tested to see their effects on the GA optimization. The results based on some real-world data and five benchmark data sets from the UCI repository show that the improvements after GA-optimized feature transformation are in <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> with the original classification rate if the classifier is used alone. It is also shown that performing the PCA and LDA transformations on the feature space prior to the GA optimization improved the final result. ...|$|R

Functional studies revealed impaired in-vitro cellular immunity with a <b>reversed</b> <b>ratio</b> of T 4 T 8 -reactive cells. After depletion of T 8 -reactive cells, the mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferative response increased to median normal values. Infiltration of T 8 positive cells was also noted in the thymus. Normal thymocytes (T 4 -, T 6 -, T 8 -reactive) were hardly present, whereas clustering of T 8 -reactive cells was associated with expression of class II MHC antigens on epithelial thymoma cells. Thymectomy and gamma-globulin substitution resulted in the disappearance of diarrhoea and respiratory infections, but did not influence the reversed T 4 T 8 ratio. The possible implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The OT-64's engine, transmission, {{suspension}} and axles were produced in Czechoslovakia. The engine {{was produced by}} Tatra. The gearbox was manufactured by Praga Hostivař. It has a pre-select Praga-Wilson gearbox, (5 forward +1 reverse gears.) A gear is selected using the gear stick then when the gear is required the left pedal (gear change action/clutch combined) is pressed to the floor, giving a hiss of air sound, on release of the pedal the dry plate clutch engages after about half the return spring controlled movement. The drive then passes to an auxiliary gearbox with low, neutral and high ratios which needs to be selected before moving off, for road/neutral/off road use, this gives option to the driver of 10 forward and 2 <b>reverse</b> <b>ratios.</b> The gear change pedal is hydraulic and on action opens an air valve which causes the selected gear to engage.

40|$|Based on the SPA test (test for {{superior}} predictive ability), Sortino and <b>reversed</b> Sortino <b>ratios,</b> {{we examined}} the profitability of a universe of 8061 technical trading rules in ten futures markets including five financial and five commodity underlying assets. We tested whether the best performing rule really beats its buy-and-hold benchmark strategy in bullish and bearish markets, respectively, during the in-sample testing period. The best rules' performance relative to the benchmark is also tested during the one-year out-of-sample period for all ten sets of data. A novel set of multi-indicator rules, MFI-RSI, and four popular categories of single-indicator rules, filter rules, moving averages, on-balance volume averages and momentum strategy in volume, were employed to form our universe of trading rules. The results on the SPA test suggest market efficiency in nine of the ten futures markets, while the results on the Sortino and <b>reversed</b> Sortino <b>ratios</b> reveal persistent outperformance of the best 'downside' and 'upside' rules relative to the buy-and-hold benchmark across time in four and three futures markets, respectively.
