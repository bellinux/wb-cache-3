25|$|In some cases, {{examination}} of laws by the Council is compulsory. Organic bills, those which fundamentally affect government and treaties, {{need to be}} assessed by the Council before they are considered ratified (Article 61-1 and 54). Amendments concerning the rules governing parliamentary procedures {{need to be considered}} by the Council, as well. Guidance may be sought from the Council in regard to whether reform should come under statute law (voted by Parliament) or whether issues are considered as règlement (regulation) to be adopted with decree of the prime minister. The re-definition of legislative dispositions as <b>regulatory</b> <b>matters</b> initially constituted a significant share of the (then light) caseload of the Council.|$|E
500|$|In November 1962 Sihanouk {{called on}} the US to stop {{supporting}} the Khmer Serei, which he believed they had been secretly doing through the CIA. He threatened to reject all economic aid from the US if they {{failed to respond to}} his demands, a threat he later carried out on 19November 1963. At the same time, Sihanouk also nationalised the country's entrepot trade, banking sector, and distillery industries. To oversee policy and <b>regulatory</b> <b>matters</b> on the country's entrepot trade, he set up the National Export-Import Corporation and Statutory Board, better known as [...] "SONEXIM". When Sarit, Diem, and US president John F. Kennedy died in November and December 1963, Sihanouk rejoiced over their deaths, as he accused them of attempting to destabilise Cambodia. He organised concerts and granted civil servants extra leave time to celebrate the occasion. When the US government protested Sihanouk's celebrations, he responded by recalling the Cambodian ambassador to the US, Nong Kimny.|$|E

40|$|The {{bad actor}} problem, or {{the puzzle of}} how to get known human rights violators to improve their practices, is central to human rights {{scholarship}} and policy-making. Scholarship has largely focused on understanding how and if state commitments to multilateral international human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, can improve human rights practices. This article reframes the bad actor problem as a <b>regulatory</b> <b>matter,</b> suggesting that international agencies may, under certain conditions, provide a way to get even 2 ̆ 7 bad actors to improve their human rights practices. By flexibly interpreting international law, international oganiZations can use their authority to coordinate state interests, while enhancing the credibility of state commitments and providing valuable legal cover for state actions. I present examples of how international agencies may and have improved human rights practices, focusing on the case of the use of international refugee law during the post- 2003 Iraqi refugee crisis in Jordan and Syria. My analysis suggests that traditional scholarly discussion of promoting compliance with international human rights instruments may be misplaced, and that the role of international agencies in regulating human rights deserves further attention...|$|R
40|$|The cost of {{political}} campaigns in the U. S. has risen substantially in recent years. For example, real spending on congressional election campaigns doubled between 1976 and 1992 (Steven D. Levitt [1995]). There {{are many reasons}} why increased campaign spending might be socially harmful. First, increased spending means increased fund-raising, which may keep politicians from their legislative duties. 1 Second, a lobbyist who makes a large campaign contribution may have undue influence on electoral outcomes, on the shaping of legislation, or {{on the outcome of}} regulatory proceedings. 2 That is, the socially preferred candidate or legislation may not prevail. Likewise, a lobbyist involved in a <b>regulatory</b> <b>matter</b> or a competition for a government contract may benefit unduly from a legislator’s intervention. 3 Third, a perception that campaign contributions purchase influence may lead to increased tolerance of corruption in the private sector. A desire to control campaign spending has spawned many initiatives to limit both campaign contributions and spending, beginning {{with the passage of the}} Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). Political Action Committees (PACs) can contribute at most $ 5, 000 per election to a candidate, while individuals can contribute at most $ 1, 000. (Restriction...|$|R
