30|$|Electron beam-sample {{interactions}} {{cannot be}} described by strictly isolated knock-on events, where atoms are abruptly {{removed from the}} object without further impact. Instead, an increase of doses and rates stimulates physically meaningful processes such as atom diffusion, surface reconstructions, and sintering. Furthermore, they may trigger distinct relaxation pathways that otherwise can only be captured if the temperature is raised or additional charge is provided. In this manner, we find that Co 3 O 4 polycrystalline films exhibit a strong tendency to sinter and that single grains can assume previously unknown reconstructions that extend from the crystal surfaces into the sub-surface region of the catalysts on a nanometer scale. Beam-induced crystal reorientations {{are found to be}} affected by diffusion-stimulated atom <b>rearrangements</b> within the <b>unit</b> cell of the material.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Comprehensive {{gene mapping}} {{reveals that the}} {{chloroplast}} genome of Trachelium caeruleum is highly re-arranged relative {{to those of other}} land plants. Evolution-ary scenarios that consist of seven to ten inversions, one or two transpositions, both expansion and contraction of the typically size-conserved inverted repeat, a presumed gene loss, deletions within two large open reading frames and several insertions, are sufficient to derive the Trache-lium arrangement from the ancestral angiosperm chloro-plast DNA arrangement. Two of the <b>rearrangements</b> dis-rupt transcriptional <b>units</b> that are otherwise conserved among land plants. At least five families of small dispersed repeats exist in the Trachelium chloroplast genome. Most of the repeats are associated with inversion endpoints and may have facilitated inversions through recombination across homologous repeats. Key words Chloroplast DNA rearrangements...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{properties of the}} triple layered Sr 4 Ru 3 O 10 have been investigated by means of neutron scattering diffraction. At zero field {{we find that the}} magnetic moments are ferromagnetically coupled and oriented along the c axis with no signatures of either long range antiferromagnetic order or ferromagnetic components in the ab plane. The field dependence of the reflection intensity points to a metamagnetic response involving only the planar magnetic moments. The structural refinement indicates a distinct <b>rearrangement</b> of the <b>unit</b> cell as a function of both temperature and in plane applied field. We show that at the temperature T 50 K, below which the metamagnetic behavior is observed, the c axis lattice parameter exhibits a rapid increase while the in plane amplitude saturates. A similar upturn of the in plane lattice parameter after the quench of the c axis amplitude occurs above a critical magnetic field...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{mutation}} {{is ultimately}} essential for adaptive evolution in all populations. It arises all the time, but is mostly fixed by enzymes. Further, most do {{consider that the}} evolution mechanism is by a natural assortment of variations in organisms in line for random variations in their DNA, and the suggestions for this are overwhelming. The altering {{of the construction of}} a gene, causing a different form that may be communicated to succeeding generations, produced by the modification of single base units in DNA, or the deletion, insertion, or <b>rearrangement</b> of larger <b>units</b> of chromosomes or genes. This altering is called a mutation. In this paper, a mathematical model is introduced to this reality. The model describes the time and space for the evolution. The tool is based on a complex domain for the space. We show that the evolution is distributed with the hypergeometric function. The Boundedness of the evolution is imposed by utilizing the Koebe function...|$|R
40|$|The only {{technique}} {{available for}} solving many important problems is searching. Since searching {{can be extremely}} costly, {{it is important to}} identify features that improve the efficiency of aearch algorithms. We compute the efficiency of simple backtracking, of an algorithm similar to backtracking except that it notices when the predicate is empty instead of noticing when it is unsatlsfiable (the empty predicate method), of the combination of simple backtracking with the empty predicate method, and of search <b>rearrangement</b> backtracking (the <b>unit</b> clause rule combined with backtracking). The analysis is done over two sets of random problems. We also consider the algorithm based on the pure literal rule that was analyzed by Goldberg and the results he obtained. All these algorithms are simplifications of the complete Putham-David procedure, which has not been analyzed as yet (although most of its components have been analyzed). The performances of the algorithms are compared and features that lead to efficient algorithms are identified. 1...|$|R
40|$|EST and genomic DNA {{sequencing}} {{efforts for}} rice and wheat {{have provided the}} basis for interpreting genome organization and evolution. In this study we have used EST and genomic sequencing information and a bioinformatic approach in a two-step strategy to align portions of the wheat and rice genomes. In the first step, wheat ESTs were used to identify rice orthologs and it was shown that wheat 3 S and rice 1 contain syntenic <b>units</b> with intrachromosomal <b>rearrangements.</b> Further analysis using anchored rice contiguous sequences and TBLASTX alignments in a second alignment step showed interruptions by orthologous genes that map elsewhere in the wheat genome. This indicates that gene content and order is not as conserved as large chromosomal blocks as previously predicted. Similarly, chromosome 7 L contains syntenic units with rice 6 and 8 but is interrupted by combinations of intrachromosomal and interchromosomal <b>rearrangements</b> involving syntenic <b>units</b> and single gene orthologs from other rice chromosome groups. We have used the rice sequence annotations to identify genes {{that can be used to}} develop markers linked to biosynthetic pathways on 3 BS controlling xanthophyll production in wheat and thus involved in determining flour colour...|$|R
40|$|Informally, a {{chemical}} reaction network is "atomic" if each reaction {{may be interpreted}} as the <b>rearrangement</b> of indivisible <b>units</b> of matter. There are several reasonable definitions formalizing this idea. We investigate the computational complexity of deciding whether a given network is atomic according {{to each of these}} definitions. Our first definition, primitive atomic, which requires each reaction to preserve the total number of atoms, is to shown to be equivalent to mass conservation. Since it is known that it can be decided in polynomial time whether a given chemical reaction network is mass-conserving, the equivalence gives an efficient algorithm to decide primitive atomicity. Another definition, subset atomic, further requires that all atoms are species. We show that deciding whether a given network is subset atomic is in NP, and the problem "is a network subset atomic with respect to a given atom set" is strongly NP-Complete. A third definition, reachably atomic, studied by Adleman, Gopalkrishnan et al., further requires that each species has a sequence of reactions splitting it into its constituent atoms. We show that there is a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether a given network is reachably atomic, improving upon the result of Adleman et al. that the problem is decidable. We show that the reachability problem for reachably atomic networks is Pspace-Complete. Finally, we demonstrate equivalence relationships between our definitions and some special cases of another existing definition of atomicity due to Gnacadja...|$|R
40|$|Convex {{polyhedral}} cuprate clusters {{are being}} formed through lateral frustration when the a and c lattice {{parameters of the}} tetragonal ACuO 2 infinite layer structure will become identical by substitution of a large cation (A = Ba 2 +). However, the corner-shared CuO 2 plaquettes of the infinite network suffer a topotactic <b>rearrangement</b> forming edge-connected <b>units,</b> for instance Cu 18 O 24 cages (polyhedron notation [4641238]) with < 90 ° ferromagnetic super-exchange interaction as found in cubic BaCuO 2. Cage formation via a hypothetical tetragonal BaCuO 2 compound (space group P 4 / nmm) will be discussed. The possibility to construct a cuprate super-cage with m 3 m symmetry (polyhedron notation [4641242438]) is being reported. This super-cage still consists of edge-connected CuO 2 plaquettes when fully decorated with copper ions, but with different curvatures, arranged in circles of 9. 39 ? of diameter with 139. 2 ° Cu-O-Cu antiferromagnetic super-exchange interaction. On the one hand, the realization of such a quite stable cuprate super-cage {{as a candidate for}} high-Tc superconductivity depends on whether a template of suitable size such as the N(CH 3) 4 + cation or C(CH 3) 4 enables its formation, {{and on the other hand}} the cage can further be stabilized by highly charged cations located along the [111] direction. Synthesis options will be proposed based on suggested cage formation pathways. An X-ray powder pattern was calculated for a less dense cluster structure of Im 3 m space group with a lattice parameter of a = 14. 938 ? and two formula units of Cu 46 O 51 to facilitate future identification.

40|$|Abstract Background Identifying {{structurally}} similar proteins {{with different}} chain topologies can aid studies in homology modeling, protein folding, protein design, and protein evolution. These include circular permuted protein structures, {{and the more}} general cases of non-cyclic permutations between similar structures, which are related by non-topological rearrangement beyond circular permutation. We present a method based on an approximation algorithm that finds sequence-order independent structural alignments that are close to optimal. We formulate the structural alignment problem as a special case of the maximum-weight independent set problem, and solve this computationally intensive problem approximately by iteratively solving relaxations of a corresponding integer programming problem. The resulting structural alignment is sequence order independent. Our method is also insensitive to insertions, deletions, and gaps. Results Using a novel similarity score and a statistical model for significance p -value, {{we are able to}} discover previously unknown circular permuted proteins between nucleoplasmin-core protein and auxin binding protein, between aspartate rasemase and 3 -dehydrogenate dehydralase, as well as between migration inhibition factor and arginine repressor which involves an additional strand-swapping. We also report the finding of non-cyclic permuted protein structures existing in nature between AML 1 /core binding factor and ribofalvin synthase. Our method can be used for large scale alignment of protein structures regardless of the topology. Conclusion The approximation algorithm introduced in this work can find good solutions for the problem of protein structure alignment. Furthermore, this algorithm can detect topological differences between two spatially similar protein structures. The alignment between MIF and the arginine repressor demonstrates our algorithm's ability to detect structural similarities even when spatial <b>rearrangement</b> of structural <b>units</b> has occurred. The effectiveness of our method is also demonstrated by the discovery of previously unknown circular permutations. In addition, we report in this study the finding of a naturally occurring non-cyclic permuted protein between AML 1 /Core Binding Factor chain F and riboflavin synthase chain A. </p...|$|R
40|$|Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multimodular enzymes which biosynthesize {{peptides}} (NRPs) {{independently of}} ribosomes. Three core domains (adenylation (A), thiolation (T), condensation (C)) comprise a functional module for NRP biosynthesis. Although NRPSs produce {{a diversity of}} bioactive compounds, {{little is known about}} the evolutionary relationships of genes encoding NRPSs and the mechanisms by which they evolve. The objectives of this research were to perform phylogenomic analyses to identify major NRPS subclasses and determine evolutionary relationships and to elucidate fine-scale evolutionary mechanisms giving rise to the diverse NRPS domain structures in fungi. Chapter 2 is a published manuscript on ferrichrome synthetases tracking the evolution of domain architectures of these relatively conserved enzymes across fungi. Results supported the hypothesis that ferrichrome synthetases evolved by tandem duplication of complete modules (A-T-C) (single or double units) and loss of single A domains or complete A-T-C modules. A mechanism for evolution of iterative biosynthesis is proposed. Protein modeling of the A domain substrate binding pockets refined characterization of key residues involved in substrate specificity, by identifying novel sites. Chapter 3 reports a fungal kingdom-wide phylogenomic study of NRPSs, with the objective of identifying subclasses. Nine were identified which fell into two major groups. One consisted of primarily mono/bi-modular NRPSs with conserved domain architectures which group with bacterial NRPSs and whose products are associated with conserved metabolic roles. The other consisted of primarily multimodular and exclusively fungal NRPSs with variable domain architectures whose products perform niche-specific functions. All groups of NRPSs were much more common in Euascomycetes than in any other fungal taxonomic group. Although NRPSs are discontinuously distributed across fungal taxa, little evidence was found for horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to fungi. Overall, this study showed that both tandem duplication and loss, as well as recombination and <b>rearrangement,</b> of modular <b>units</b> (either complete A-T-C modules or single A domains) are mechanisms by which NRPSs and their chemical products evolve. Phylogenomic analysis identified subgroups of NRPSs possibly reflecting common function and suggested an older evolutionary origin of several mono/bimodular groups while multimodular fungal NRPSs are more recently derived and highly expanded in Euascomycetes...|$|R
