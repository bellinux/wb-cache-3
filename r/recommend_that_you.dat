25|$|When not {{properly}} implemented, continuous auditing {{can result in}} hundreds—even thousands—of false positives and wasted effort. Many companies that have experienced success with continuous auditing <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> start small. Select which area of the company poses the greatest risk and where its transactions and control systems are most important to the company for your initial foray into continuous auditing. Automate {{a small number of}} key initial tests, such as comparing your accounts payable vendor master file with the employee address file, to uncover potential policy violations or fraud. Moving forward, increase the tests and gradually expand into other business processes in stages.|$|E
500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film 4 (out of 5) stars, {{saying that it}} was [...] "attention-grabbing from {{inception}} till conclusion. The drama only soars higher and the complex love story gets more and more gripping as the conflict between the characters come to the fore." [...] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave it 4 (out of 5) stars: [...] "At a gracious 3 hours runtime, JTHJ feels like an epic love story. And it is just that. JTHJ is the perfect adieu to a hallmark career. It is the best romantic film made in this generation." [...] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it 3.5 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Despite the lovey-dovey nothingness that drives the plot, Jab Tak Hai Jaan has more substance than most romantic films that come out of Bollywood." [...] Meena Iyer of The Times of India rated it 3.5 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "Every frame is picture-perfect, the emotions are well nuanced. But there is one inherent flawthe story by Aditya Chopra is hackneyed." [...] Subhash Jha (also from The Times of India) said, [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan makes {{you fall in love with}} love all over again." [...] Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan is too tangled to transport you. But I <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> see it. Because only Yash Chopra could make heartache so attractive and ennobling that his characters wear it like a badge of honor." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "I'm going with three out of five for the late Yash Chopra's Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Despite its many script problems, it's a consistently watchable film that oozes with feeling and real emotion. A fitting swan song." [...] OPEN magazine gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars, praising Yash Chopra's direction. Ajit Duara called it [...] "a deeply-felt cinematic perspective from 80 years of living." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "As a swan-song for the master director, Jab Tak Hai Jaan might only be a middling effort. But then, sometimes, all we need is a Khan-song." [...] Shabana Ansari of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "If you must, watch Jab Tak Hai Jaan for Shah Rukh, who can still convey love and passion in a fleeting look or a dimpled smile; and for Yash Chopra who gave us some of the most enduring romances of all times." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the number}} of {{children}} with intersex conditions referred to Lawson Wilkins' new pediatric endocrinology clinic at Hopkins increased, it was recognized that doctors [...] "couldn't tell by looking" [...] at the external genitalia, and many errors of diagnosis based on outward appearance had led to anomalous sex assignments.

2500|$|Jo Garfein at TV Overmind {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} preview, saying, [...] "This episode {{has more of}} an early X-Files feel, in a good way... To {{those of you who}} have either given up on the series or are on the fence, I <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> give Fringe another try. If 'Inner Child' is any indication, we are in for a very satisfying and engaging journey for the rest of the season." [...] Alan Sepinwall's review in The Star-Ledger was overall positive, [...] "As far as the episode as a whole goes, I thought it was fairly solid procedural hour of 'Fringe.' No, it didn't follow up on any of the revelations from 'Ability,' but it also didn't feature any of Agent Harris, and both the serial killer case and Olivia's rapport with the kid were compelling enough that I can wait on the mythology stuff for later." [...] Jane Boursaw at TV Squad rated the episode very highly in her recap, and also mooted a theory about the Child, [...] "My theory is that the boy is another Observer. They certainly looked a lot alike, didn't they? Could the boy have come from another dimension and ended up beneath the building? And why did the CIA guy say that they'd found 'another one.'" [...] Apparently, they're keeping track of these creatures or Observers. And if so, where are the others?" ...|$|E
