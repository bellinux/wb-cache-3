40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>retail</b> REITs, <b>retail</b> stocks, and <b>retail</b> real estate during the period 1983 through 1991. Evidence of a positive contemporaneous relationship between <b>retail</b> stocks and <b>retail</b> REITs, even after controlling for the market return, is found. However, no positive evidence is found for a relationship between <b>retail</b> real estate and either <b>retail</b> REITs or <b>retail</b> stocks. Some evidence of a negative relationship between office and R&D office real estate and lagged <b>retail</b> REIT and lagged <b>retail</b> stock returns is found, although these results are very weak. The evidence for contemporaneous relationship between <b>retail</b> REITs and <b>retail</b> stocks suggests the presence of some shared fundamental factor (or factors) {{in addition to the}} market return. The presence of this factor(s) may be partly accounted for by overage rents. However, the lack of a relationship between <b>retail</b> real estate and either <b>retail</b> REITs or <b>retail</b> stocks places the significance of such factors in some doubt. ...|$|R

40|$|In large <b>retail</b> stores, France is {{characterized}} by market saturation and even a decline of several <b>retail</b> concepts such as variety stores, or even supermarkets and hypermarkets (Cliquet, 2000). This situation leads to a fierce competition and raises questions which affect marketing strategies of French <b>retail</b> companies. Given the legal context, the French retailers can increase sales through <b>retail</b> brands which appear to be henceforth among the most effective marketing tools. Indeed, product innovation, sophisticated packaging and <b>retail</b> brands - from generic products to premium <b>retail</b> brands (Kumar and Steenkamp, 2007) - could create consumer value. There are thus today real <b>retail</b> branding strategies consisting in creating consumer value leading {{to the idea of}} <b>retail</b> brand equity. This paper focuses on <b>retail</b> brand equity to understand where this <b>retail</b> brand value stems from and how to measure it in the French <b>retail</b> context. Adapting the brand equity literature to the <b>retail</b> brand opens large perspectives in the way of considering this type of brands helping managers to examine the importance of components in the shaping of their brand value and finally to develop better strategic and tactical decisions concerning <b>retail</b> brand positioning. Keller's contributions (Keller, 1993), qualitative methodology and confirmatory analysis are used to first conceptualise and measure a model of <b>retail</b> brand equity. All measures of the model built here are validated. The model is validated through a Path-PLS modelling process. This methodological choice is recommended when formative and reflective variables are integrated in the model (Jarvis et al., 2003). A replication is made to confirm the model validity. <b>Retail</b> brand equity is composed of two components: awareness, and <b>retail</b> brand image (which is measured by perceived quality, price image, personality, brand name and store service). All of these components influence positively and significantly the <b>retail</b> brand purchase (except the store service which influence negatively the <b>retail</b> brand purchase). <b>Retail</b> brand awareness and perceived quality are the two main components which determine the <b>retail</b> brand purchase. Results show also that the <b>retail</b> brand image is a partial mediator on the relation between <b>retail</b> brand awareness and its purchase. This research reveals finally that the <b>retail</b> brand equity can be moderated by the product category and the <b>retail</b> brand strategy. The <b>retail</b> brand equity is higher on basic products than on symbolic ones. The strategy of service brand applied to <b>retail</b> brands seems to be more favorable than classical private label strategy. <b>retail</b> brands, brand equity, retailers' strategies, confirmatory analysis, Path-...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>retail</b> trade {{is one of the most}} {{important}} parts of any economy. <b>Retail</b> trade is also a very important component of GDP, whereby rising <b>retail</b> trade means a growth in consumption and a fall in unemployment.
