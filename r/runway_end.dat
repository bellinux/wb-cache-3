25|$|The TSB advised {{changes to}} bring Canadian runway {{standards}} {{in line with}} those used abroad, either by extending {{them to have a}} 300m runway safety area (or <b>Runway</b> <b>End</b> Safety Area) or, where that is impossible, providing an equivalently effective backup method of stopping aircraft. Other recommendations that the TSB made includes having the Department of Transport establish clear standards limiting approaches and landings in convective weather for all operators at Canadian airports, and mandate training for all pilots involved in Canadian air operations to better enable them to make landing decisions in bad weather.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the WAAS, the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) did {{not have}} the ability to provide lateral and {{vertical}} navigation for precision approaches for all users at all locations. The traditional system for precision approaches is the instrument landing system (ILS), which used a series of radio transmitters each broadcasting a single signal to the aircraft. This complex series of radios needs to be installed at every <b>runway</b> <b>end,</b> some offsite, along a line extended from the runway centerline, making the implementation of a precision approach both difficult and very expensive. The ILS system is composed of 180 different transmitting antennas at each point built. The newer system is free of huge antenna systems at each airport.|$|E

2500|$|The fatal {{accident}} occurred on 4 March 1962. A Douglas DC-7C named Star of Robbie Burns (registration: G-ARUD) operating the Douala—Lisbon sector of Caledonian Airways flight 153 (a Lourenço Marques — Luxembourg charter {{on behalf of}} Trans Africa Air Coach of London) crashed shortly after a night takeoff from Douala Airport's runway 12, killing all 111 occupants (ten crew and 101 passengers). At {{the time of the}} accident, the weather was very hot and humid. After a long takeoff run on the airport's [...] long runway, the aircraft gained insufficient height to clear the trees close to the <b>runway</b> <b>end.</b> The aircraft's port wing struck trees [...] above aerodrome elevation, some [...] from the <b>runway</b> <b>end</b> and [...] from the extended centreline. This resulted in the aircraft crashing into a tidal swamp and exploding on impact. Although this was the only {{fatal accident}} in Caledonian's history, it was the deadliest air disaster in British aviation history at the time. The commission of inquiry probing the accident determined that the evidence at the crash site seemed to suggest that a jammed elevator spring tab mechanism prevented the aircraft from attaining sufficient height to clear the obstacles in the runway end's vicinity. This would have resulted in abnormal elevator control forces during takeoff. It was also consistent with tests showing this to prolong takeoff runs that had an attendant risk of losing height during flap retraction when the aircraft became airborne. The commission of inquiry also described a number of adverse features that might have aggravated the circumstances in which the accident occurred. It had furthermore not been able to exclude the possibility of an instrument failure as a probable accident cause as the instruments were either not recovered or too damaged for a valid expert examination.|$|E

As the aircraft was going to overshoot the end of the runway he steered it to the left to avoid hitting obstacles. The aircraft became airborne for a short distance, crashing through the airport boundary fence, crossing a public road and coming to a halt {{a quarter of a mile}} from the <b>runway</b> <b>end.</b> Although the aircraft was a complete write-off, there were no fatalities among the four occupants (three crew and one passenger).|$|E
