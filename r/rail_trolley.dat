In December 2006 the Utah Transit Authority, Salt Lake City, and South Salt Lake commissioned a Transportation Alternatives Study to examine transit possibilities on the Sugar House Branch of the old Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW). The study determined that a trolley running along a pre-existing rail line was the preferred alternative. In May 2009, Mayor Ralph Becker stated that the project could be complete by 2012, will cost $40 million to $50 million, and that he hopes it {{is the beginning of}} a new streetcar system across the city.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "Dido", as {{applying}} to New Zealand shunting locomotives, {{can be traced}} back to the small A class. Crew members from the ship , moored at Bluff Harbour, in May, 1875 were looking for a night on the town, while in port. They took a small 4-wheeled <b>rail</b> <b>trolley,</b> and taking turns, both rode and pushed the trolley into Invercargill. When the southern enginemen saw the first A class locomotive arrive for use as a shunter, the name [...] "Dido" [...] was given as a nickname because of its diminutive size. This size led British Journalist Charles Rous-Marten to describe them as [...] "a most absurd dwarf". Today, the term [...] "Dido" [...] is used to describe any small shunter on the NZR network.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1765, {{lumber and}} grist mills were {{established}} on Mill Street, with taverns built soon thereafter on Parade Street. About 1822, the courthouse was built, which would become county {{seat at the}} creation of Belknap County in 1840. In 1823, the Belknap Mill was built to manufacture textiles; in operation by 1828, the structure is today a museum listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is the oldest unaltered brick textile mill in the country. Local industry produced lumber, textiles, shoes, hosiery, knitting machinery and needles. But the city's largest employer would be the Laconia Car Company, builder of <b>rail,</b> <b>trolley</b> and subway cars. Started in 1848, it lasted until the 1930s.

40|$|This project {{presents}} {{the development of}} a dynamic model and an efficient control algorithm of a three-dimensional (3 D) gantry crane with payload. A 3 D gantry crane with simultaneous travelling, traversing, and hoisting is considered. The dynamic equations of motion of the gantry crane system are derived using the Lagrange’s method and represented in nonlinear differential equations. Simulation is performed using Matlab/Simulink to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the system both in time and frequency domains. System responses including positions of <b>rail,</b> <b>trolley</b> and payload, and payload sway angle are obtained and analysed. For control of the 3 D gantry crane, a proportional-derivative controller with input shaping for input tracking and reduction of payload sway is proposed. The performances of the controller are examined in terms of input tracking capability, level of sway reduction, and robustness of the input shaper. Simulation and experimental exercises using a lab-scaled 3 D gantry crane show that the proposed controller is capable of minimising the payload sway while achieving satisfactory input tracking performance. The controller is also shown to be robust up to 50 % error tolerance in the sway frequencies. Moreover, with the experimental results, it is demonstrated that the proposed control is practical and easy to implement in real-time...|$|E
40|$|SHELBURNE FALLS – The {{vision of}} {{extending}} existing trolley car operations through Shelburne Falls {{is taking its}} next step, with an engineering study of the proposed right of way. Fourteen Senior University of Massachusetts engineering students will conduct a comprehensive final project by evaluating {{the right of way}} for the Shelburne Falls Trolley Museum from the present museum to the Iron Bridge in Shelburne Falls. The return of the trolley car operations to downtown will be a historic moment, after ceasing almost exactly 80 years ago, when the last trolley operated over these sections to Colrain. The engineering study will commence this month by four teams. The Shelburne Falls Trolley Museum hopes to expand the current abbreviated trolley ride with the planned expansion into Shelburne Falls. The museum already operates weekends and holidays on approximately one eighth of a mile of existing railroad tracks once owned by the Boston and Maine railroad in Shelburne Falls. The engineering survey starts the first steps of re-building the original right of way of the Shelburne Falls and Colrain Street Railway, which was abandoned in 1927 and {{paved the way for the}} Bridge of Flowers attraction when the tracks were lifted. The University of Massachusetts engineering students plan to accomplish the following: • Analysis of the retaining wall on Depot Street to ensure it can withstand light <b>rail</b> <b>trolley</b> operations. Depot Street was once the right of way of the original trolley line. • Survey of the yard and Depot Street, tying in to existing surveys of th...|$|E
40|$|A systems {{engineering}} based methodology for exploring technical sustainability {{in the social}} and environmental context was used to investigate a specific transportation load in the city of Christchurch. The process includes defining sustainability performance parameters in engineering terms, defining service objectives in socio-economic terms, and then generating concept designs using standard engineering modeling. The approach reflects a balance between form and function, and we refer to the resulting concepts as energy architecture. In this study, the performance-objective methodology was used to develop the energy architecture for a wind and solar powered public transportation service that provides a 35 km circuit of schools, shopping malls, and industrial parks. The service objective for the design was set by an existing bus service. A number of concepts were explored for the renewable energy supply of an electric light <b>rail</b> <b>trolley</b> circuit on a dedicated (not grid connected) electric supply network. Each concept represents a different degree of capital investment and system complexity, and achieves a certain level of the desired transportation service on any given day. Real-time simulated performance modeled with historical local weather data was used to compare the performance of each of the possible architectures to the objective. A service factor was calculated to evaluate the level of transport service performance compared to the objective. The results demonstrate that no amount of investment in wind and solar energy capacity can provide the same service as the fossil fuel system. When pumped-hydro storage of wind and solar energy was added to the system, the service factor could be increased to 100 %. The modeling exercise points out that a relatively modest investment in wind generation can produce a useful service. However, the schedule would need to be flexible to match the wind energy availability. A system like this could work if a communication system could be implemented to provide real-time schedule information...|$|E
50|$|Developing a BEV {{infrastructure}} {{would provide}} the advantage of virtually unrestricted highway range. Since many destinations are within 100 km of a major highway, BEV technology could {{reduce the need for}} expensive battery systems. Unfortunately, private use of the existing electrical system is almost universally prohibited. Besides, the technology for such electrical infrastructure is largely outdated and, outside some cities, not widely distributed (see Conduit current collection, trams, electric <b>rail,</b> <b>trolleys,</b> third <b>rail).</b> Updating the required electrical and infrastructure costs could perhaps be funded by toll revenue or by dedicated transportation taxes.|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} crew {{needed to}} cross the north-south steam railroad to reach downtown Santa Rosa. The steam railroad had operated a parallel branch line from Santa Rosa to Sebastopol since 1890, and would not consent to the crossing allowing a new competitor to offer direct service downtown. By November the steam railroad stationed guards at the proposed crossing site to prevent cutting of its <b>rails.</b> <b>Trolley</b> service began to {{the west side of}} the crossing on 1 December 1904. Rails were laid on the east side of the steam railroad tracks, and an electric wire was strung overhead in preparation for installing the crossing.
