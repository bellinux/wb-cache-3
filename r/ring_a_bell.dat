5|$|Preliminary work on Vesperia {{began in}} 2005. Full {{development}} began in May {{of the following}} year and lasted approximately two years. Returning staff included producer Yoshito Higuchi, composers Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura, and character designer Kōsuke Fujishima. The writers included Takashi Hasegawa and Hideo Baba. Developed by the same team that made Tales of Symphonia and Tales of the Abyss, it was designed for the Xbox 360 as the PS3 {{had yet to be}} shown to the company and the former console was achieving international popularity. The anime cutscenes were created by Production I.G, with an art style influenced by cel-shaded animation. The game's theme song, <b>Ring</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bell</b> by Bonnie Pink, was used for both the Japanese and English releases. Upon release, the game was an international commercial success, selling over 600,000 copies worldwide. Critical reception has been generally positive, and further media related to the world of Vesperia has been developed.|$|E

This system was developed by the London Pneumatic Despatch Company and became widely used; Harrods in particular used this system until at least the 1960s. Murdoch also used compressed air to <b>ring</b> <b>a</b> <b>bell</b> at his home to announce visitors.|$|E

The Orem Robbins Science Center was {{dedicated}} on May 9, 1991, {{and became the}} home of the biology, chemistry, and physics departments. Old Main, the campus landmark, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places; it was renovated during the summer of 1978 and again after a fire on September 2, 1985, caused $10,000 worth of damage. In October 1990, workers began a $290,000 renovation. They removed and rebuilt a -high section of the tower, covered the 106-year-old building with new concrete shingles, and installed a four-sided clock in the tower. In 1993, an electric carillon was added to the tower that can <b>ring</b> <b>a</b> <b>bell</b> and play selected music.|$|E
25|$|Set in the Muromachi {{period in}} early 16th-century Japan, the young ninja Rantaro (Seishiro Kato) is {{born into a}} family of low-ranking ninjas. Rantaro is sent by {{his father and mother}} (Shido Nakamura and Rei Dan) to attend the six-year course at a Ninja Academy run by Denzo Yamada (Susumu Terajima).

500|$|One {{feature that}} {{does not appear in}} the canons but is often found in stone sculptures and bronzes is the {{presence}} of a small bell tied by a string just below the right knee. The bell is interpreted by the scholar Mahadev Chakravarti to be symbolic of Bhikshatana's outcast status, as the bell is symbolic of the Pariah [...] "untouchables" [...] of South India, who traditionally had to <b>ring</b> <b>a</b> <b>bell</b> when entering a Brahmin village. In bronzes, the deer and the trishula were generally cast separately and positioned later in the icon, but since many of these separate pieces have been lost over time, bronzes often appear without them.|$|E

500|$|The seminal {{research}} on delayed gratification – the now-famous [...] "marshmallow experiment" [...] – {{was conducted by}} Walter Mischel in the 1960s and 1970s at Stanford University. Mischel and his colleagues were interested in strategies that preschool children used to resist temptation. They presented four-year-olds with a marshmallow and told the children that they had two options: (1) <b>ring</b> <b>a</b> <b>bell</b> at any point to summon the experimenter and eat the marshmallow, or (2) wait until the experimenter returned (about 15 minutes later), and earn two marshmallows. The message was: [...] "small reward now, bigger reward later." [...] Some children broke down and ate the marshmallow, whereas others were able to delay gratification and earn the coveted two marshmallows. In follow-up experiments, Mischel found that children were able to wait longer if they used certain [...] "cool" [...] distraction techniques (covering their eyes, hiding under the desk, singing songs, or imagining pretzels instead of the marshmallow in front of them), or if they changed the way they thought about the marshmallow (focusing on its similarity to a cotton ball, rather than on its gooey, delectable taste).|$|E
500|$|... "The Harrowing" [...] is {{the sixth}} and final episode of the first series of British dark comedy {{anthology}} series Inside No. 9. It aired on 12 March 2014 on BBC Two. The episode was written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, and stars Shearsmith, Aimee-Ffion Edwards, Helen McCrory, Poppy Rush and Sean Buckley. While comedic in places, [...] "The Harrowing" [...] makes extensive use of gothic horror elements transmuted into a modern context. The plot follows Katy (Edwards), who has been hired to housesit for eccentric siblings Hector (Shearsmith) and Tabitha (McCrory). They rarely leave the house, but have an event to attend. They tell Katy about their bedridden, disabled brother Andras (Buckley), who cannot speak but will <b>ring</b> <b>a</b> <b>bell</b> if he needs assistance. Katy is joined by her friend Shell (Rush) once Hector and Tabitha leave, and, upon hearing Andras's bell, the pair reluctantly head upstairs. The episode takes place in Hector and Tabitha's mansion, which is kept deliberately cold and filled with paintings depicting Hell. The writers experimented {{with a variety of}} possible endings, hoping to make the episode's close both interesting and scary.|$|E
500|$|Snake Rattle 'n' Roll {{features}} two snakes – Rattle and Roll – as {{they make}} their way through 11 [...] isometric levels. The object in each level is to eat enough [...] "Nibbley Pibbleys" [...] – small round creatures found throughout each level – to gain enough weight to <b>ring</b> <b>a</b> <b>bell</b> on top of a weighing machine located {{at the end of the}} level; this causes a door for the next level to open. Players maneuver their snakes throughout the level with the control pad and are able to pick up Nibbley Pibbleys by pressing the B button on the controller. The snakes' lengths increase when they eat; players' snake length grows more quickly when they eat Nibbley Pibbleys of their own color, and they grow the most when they eat yellow ones. Located in each level are dispensers which randomly spew out Nibbley Pibbleys; however, they also spew out bombs which can damage the snakes. When a snake reaches a long enough length, the tail begins to flash, which means the snake is heavy enough to exit that level. [...] At that point, they must find and jump on the scale in order to ring the bell and open the exit door.|$|E

500|$|A further {{reason for}} the absence of Baroque decoration, and the most common, is that most rooms were never {{intended}} for such decoration. Many of the palazzi were vast, meant for huge numbers of people. The household of the Sicilian aristocrat, beginning with himself, his wife and many children, would typically also contain a collection of poorer relatives and other extended family members, all of whom had minor apartments in the house. Moreover, there were paid employees, often including a private chaplain or confessor, a major domo, governesses, secretary, archivist, accountant, librarian, and innumerable lower servants, such as a porter to <b>ring</b> <b>a</b> <b>bell</b> a prescribed number of times according to the rank of an approaching guest. Often the servants' extended families, especially if elderly, also lived in the palazzo. Thus many rooms were needed to house the household. These everyday living quarters, even for the [...] "Maestro and Maestra di Casa", were often simply decorated and furnished. Further rooms were required by the Sicilian tradition that it was a sign of poor breeding to permit even mere acquaintances to stay in local inns. Any visiting foreigner, especially an Englishman, was regarded as a special trophy and added social prestige. Hence the Sicilian aristocrat's home was seldom empty or quiet.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order for}} thought {{suppression}} and its effectiveness to be studied, researchers {{have had to}} find methods of recording the processes {{going on in the}} mind. One experiment designed with this purpose was performed by Wegner, Schneider, Carter & White. They asked participants to avoid thinking of a specific target (e.g. a white bear) for five minutes, but if they did, they were told then to <b>ring</b> <b>a</b> <b>bell.</b> After this, participants were told that for the next five minutes they were to think about the target. There was evidence that unwanted thoughts occurred more frequently in those who used thought suppression compared to those who were not. Furthermore, there was also evidence that during the second stage, those who had used thought suppression had a higher frequency of target thoughts than did those who hadn't used thought suppression; later coined the rebound effect. This effect has been replicated and can even be done with implausible targets, such as the thought of a [...] "green rabbit". From these implications, Wegner eventually developed the [...] "ironic process theory".|$|E
