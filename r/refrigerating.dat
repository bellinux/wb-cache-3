5|$|Neon is the second-lightest noble gas, after helium. It glows reddish-orange in {{a vacuum}} {{discharge}} tube. Also, neon has the narrowest liquid range of any element: from 24.55 K to 27.05 K (−248.45°C to −245.95°C, or −415.21°F to −410.71°F). It has over 40 times the <b>refrigerating</b> capacity of liquid helium and three times that of liquid hydrogen (on a per unit volume basis). In most applications it is a less expensive refrigerant than helium.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} the bulb. <b>Refrigerating</b> the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E
5|$|Noble gases {{have very}} low boiling and melting points, {{which makes them}} useful as {{cryogenic}} refrigerants. In particular, liquid helium, which boils at , is used for superconducting magnets, such as those needed in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance. Liquid neon, although it does not reach temperatures as low as liquid helium, also finds use in cryogenics because it has over 40times more <b>refrigerating</b> capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|Selfe {{achieved}} {{international recognition}} in 1861 when leading British journal The Engineer published illustrations of his designs {{for one of}} the first <b>refrigerating</b> machines. One such machine was installed behind the Royal Hotel in George Street in Sydney's ice-works– one of the world's earliest commercial refrigeration plants. The decades following Selfe's arrival in Australia were watershed years in the development of refrigeration technology, and he was closely involved with its evolution. The introduction of refrigeration to the colony revolutionised farming, allowing the expansion of settlement, and made possible the export of meat and dairy products. In Sydney itself, refrigeration changed commercial practices and led to the eventual demise of city dairies. Selfe became an international authority on refrigeration engineering; he wrote articles and eventually a definitive textbook on the subject, published in the US in 1900.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} {{artificial}} refrigeration began when Scottish professor William Cullen designed a small <b>refrigerating</b> machine in 1755.

25|$|Probably {{the most}} widely used current {{applications}} of refrigeration are for air conditioning of private homes and public buildings, and <b>refrigerating</b> foodstuffs in homes, restaurants and large storage warehouses.

25|$|While {{the first}} transfusions {{had to be}} made {{directly}} from donor to receiver before coagulation, it was discovered that by adding anticoagulant and <b>refrigerating</b> the blood it was possible to store it for some days, thus opening the way for the development of blood banks.

His attempts, using phosphate of soda, however, were unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Battery {{life can}} be {{extended}} by storing the batteries at a low temperature, as in a refrigerator or freezer, which slows the side reactions. Such storage can {{extend the life of}} alkaline batteries by about 5%; rechargeable batteries can hold their charge much longer, depending upon type. To reach their maximum voltage, batteries must be returned to room temperature; discharging an alkaline battery at 250 mA at 0°C is only half as efficient as at 20°C. Alkaline battery manufacturers such as Duracell do not recommend <b>refrigerating</b> batteries.|$|E

Additional <b>refrigerating</b> and air conditioning plant was installed {{in some of the}} other disused holds. Without cargo the ship would be higher in the water, so holds 2 and 3 were ballasted with 250 tons each of concrete blocks.|$|E
25|$|The first Norman {{fishing port}} of {{shellfish}} (clams, whelks, dog cockles, Saint-Jacques scallops), crustaceans (lobsters, brown crabs, small crabs, spider crabs) and fish (bream, rays, sharks, soles, pollock, bass, red mullet, cod, cuttlefish and squid) for local consumption with a fish market, a <b>refrigerating</b> terminal and a computerised sale of products. The tonnage landed (excluding farming) {{is of the}} order of 16,000 tonnes per year. An average of seventy-five equipped vessels with nearly 450 professional sailors attend the port. The marine cultures present on the islands of Chausey produce nearly 250 tons of clams, 5,000 tonnes of mussels and 100 tons of oysters.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooling system}} was based around a high-efficiency {{air-cooled}} condensing chiller. Each office was provided {{with its own}} thermal controls, from the mechanicals of the compartmentalized four-pipe and two-pipe fan-coil underfloor air distribution system, allowing ventilated air to be warmer and cleaner, to the operable windows and shades, so that occupants could work at their own comfort levels. Occupancy sensors shut off ventilation when no one is present. If these measures worked as planned, the total cooling load capacity would be only 29 watts per square metre (2.6 per square foot), and the building would see a 45% improvement over American Society of Heating, <b>Refrigerating</b> and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) energy-use standards.|$|E

25|$|The new <b>refrigerating</b> {{technology}} {{first met}} with widespread industrial {{use as a}} means to freeze meat supplies for transport by sea in reefer ships from the British Dominions and other countries to the British Isles. The first to achieve this breakthrough was an entrepreneur who had emigrated to New Zealand. William Soltau Davidson thought that Britain's rising population and meat demand could mitigate the slump in world wool markets that was heavily affecting New Zealand. After extensive research, he commissioned the Dunedin to be refitted with a compression refrigeration unit for meat shipment in 1881. On February 15, 1882, the Dunedin sailed for London with what was to be the first commercially successful refrigerated shipping voyage, and the foundation of the refrigerated meat industry.|$|E
25|$|An {{ice cream}} maker is a machine {{used to make}} small {{quantities}} of ice cream at home. The machine may stir the mixture by hand-cranking or with an electric motor, and may chill the ice cream by using a freezing mixture, by pre-cooling the machine in a freezer, or by the machine itself <b>refrigerating</b> the mixture. An ice cream maker must freeze the mixture, and must simultaneously stir or churn it to prevent the formation of ice crystals and aerate it to produce smooth and creamy ice cream. In 1843, New England housewife Nancy Johnson invented the hand-cranked ice cream churn. She patented her invention but lacked the resources to make and market it herself. Johnson sold the patent for $200 to a Philadelphia kitchen wholesaler who, by 1847, made enough ice cream makers to satisfy the high demand. From 1847 to 1877, more than 70 improvements to ice cream makers were patented.|$|E
