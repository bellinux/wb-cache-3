40|$|A small scale, {{high speed}} {{turbomachine}} is described, {{as well as}} a process for manufacturing the turbomachine. The turbomachine is manufactured by diffusion bonding stacked sheets of metal foil, each of which has been pre-formed to correspond to a cross section of the turbomachine structure. The turbomachines include <b>rotating</b> <b>elements</b> as well as static structures. Using this process, turbomachines may be manufactured with <b>rotating</b> <b>elements</b> that have outer diameters of less than four inches in size, and/or blading heights of less than 0. 1 inches.

50|$|Any {{devices that}} {{extracts}} energy from or imparts energy to a continuously moving stream of fluid {{can be called}} a Turbomachine. Elaborating, a turbomachine is a power or head generating machine which employs the dynamic action of a <b>rotating</b> <b>element,</b> the rotor; {{the action of the}} rotor changes the energy level of the continuously flowing fluid through the machine. Turbines, compressors and fans are all members of this family of machines.|$|E
50|$|A face cam {{produces}} {{motion by}} using a follower riding {{on the face of}} a disk. The most common type has the follower ride in a slot so that the captive follower produces radial motion with positive positioning without the need for a spring or other mechanism to keep the follower in contact with the control surface. A face cam of this type generally has only one slot for a follower on each face. In some applications, a single element, such as a gear, a barrel cam, or other <b>rotating</b> <b>element</b> with a flat face, may do duty as a face cam in addition to other purposes.|$|E
50|$|The forming yarn rotates at {{high speed}} compare to other <b>rotating</b> <b>elements.</b> It can spin yarn at very high twist {{insertion}} rates (ie.300,000 twist/min). The yarn tension is practically independent of speed and hence very high production rates (up to 300 m/min) can be attainable. The yarns are bulkier than rotor yarns.|$|R

Lastly, a numerical test is carried out, which coincides with our theoretical analysis...|$|R
50|$|Contemporary {{analysis}} suggests {{that since the}} two recurring series shows (Shaft and Hawkins) appealed to vastly different audience bases; alternating the broadcasts only served to confuse fans of either series, giving neither one the time {{to build up a}} large viewership. In addition, the third <b>rotating</b> <b>element,</b> was not a series production at all, but a single issue feature-length film. And as the format itself, was yet still new and novel, viewers for either of the programs (including the first-run movies), would tune in to see their favored series; only to be confronted (in two out of every three weeks) with a program that they had little or no interest in; and, no desire to learn anything about.|$|E

It has a form of evening pulley with aluminium skeleton and the central <b>rotating</b> <b>element,</b> often wrapped in hard rubber, which can work. Quality of the product was very quickly recognized and up until 1960, most fishing boats in the northern seine fleet had installed the power block. It made possible the renaissance of the moribund United States distant water tuna fleet, an event that put the United States into {{the forefront of the}} fishing world and has kept it there, helped by the adoption of synthetic fibers for netting.|$|E
50|$|The {{reciprocating}} action may be produced several ways. A crank or Scotch yoke type drive may be used, {{a swash plate}} type drive, a captive cam or eccentric, barrel cam, or other rotary to linear drive. Modern tools are built with variants {{of all of these}} mechanisms. Eccentric cam, crank and scotch yoke drives need balance weights to reduce vibration in the plane of the <b>rotating</b> <b>element,</b> and may still exhibit vibration that is objectionable to a user of a handheld saw and can lead to difficulty in controlling a cut. The swash plate drive has the advantage that there is little rotational out of balance, so the principal vibration is in line with the blade. This is generally controllable by keeping the foot of a handheld tool against the work.|$|E

Two experiments are discussed where uncontrolled synchronization between two types of identical oscillators is investigated.

50|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, a key is {{a machine}} element used to connect a <b>rotating</b> machine <b>element</b> to a shaft. The key prevents relative rotation {{between the two}} parts and may enable torque transmission. For a key to function, the shaft and <b>rotating</b> machine <b>element</b> must have a keyway and a keyseat, which is a slot and pocket in which the key fits. The whole system is called a keyed joint. A keyed joint may allow relative axial movement between the parts.|$|R

This feature is controlled by rotating the soft focus selector which has three choices; 0, 1, and 2. On the 0 setting, it functions as a standard 135mm prime lens. Settings 1 and 2 adjust the amount of softness in the focus. This is done by <b>rotating</b> <b>elements</b> that are inside of the lens to create deliberate spherical aberration.|$|R

The third <b>rotating</b> <b>element</b> of Warner Brothers Presents, Cheyenne, the first of seven westerns produced for ABC, was a non-directly-derivative concept (Warners 1947 western, Cheyenne has no connection to the series) which also made history as TV's first hour-long western and also the first western series made for adults, rather than children, who had been watching such half-hour series as The Lone Ranger and The Cisco Kid since the earliest years of full-schedule TV programming. Analogous to the abbreviated time allotted for 8 of Casablanca's 10 installments, the 48-minute episode length was also applicable to 8 of Cheyenne's 15 installments and all 7 installments of Kings Row.|$|E

50|$|A type of {{pneumatic}} motor, {{known as}} a rotary vane motor, uses air to produce rotational motion to a shaft. The <b>rotating</b> <b>element</b> is a slotted rotor which is mounted on a drive shaft. Each slot of the rotor is fitted with a freely sliding rectangular vane. The vanes are extended to the housing walls using springs, cam action, or air pressure, depending on the motor design. Air is pumped through the motor input which pushes on the vanes creating the rotational motion of the central shaft. Rotation speeds can vary between 100 and 25,000 rpm depending on several factors which include the amount of air pressure at the motor inlet and {{the diameter of the}} housing. One application for vane-type air motors is to start large industrial diesel or natural gas engines. Stored energy in the form of compressed air, nitrogen or natural gas enters the sealed motor chamber and exerts pressure against the vanes of a rotor. This causes the rotor to turn at high speed. Because the engine flywheel requires a great deal of torque to start the engine, reduction gears are used. Reduction gears create high torque levels with the lower amounts of energy input. These reduction gears allow for sufficient torque to be generated by the engine flywheel while it is engaged by the pinion gear of the air motor or air starter.|$|E
