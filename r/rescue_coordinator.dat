40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedPredicting the thermal {{structure of the}} oceans is of importance to the Naval tactician, logistician, or search and <b>rescue</b> <b>coordinator.</b> Understanding {{the structure of the}} oceans provides valuable insights to those who must utilize the oceanic environment effectively in their day to day operations. Today, recent information about an area is limited tc point observations of single bathythermographs. Few models produce an accurate picture of the ocean environment {{that can be used for}} updating tactics to conform to a changing situation. Producing a reliable prediction of conditions for a large area, while using limited resources, is the basic objective of this paper. Satellite infrared imaging of the ocean surface has been used effectively to map sea surface temperature patterns. Such sea surface temperature patterns can be used, along with climatology, tc identify subsurface thermal structure in an ocean area according to results of this study. More accurate inputs can be made to range dependent acoustic prediction models, thus improving the ASW environmental predictions available to fleet users. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

[...] Using an assembled database of drifting buoys in the North Atlantic Ocean, the accuracy of the MiniMax and the Norwegian Meteorological Office implementation of the Monte Carlo methods are evaluated. Results from the assessment indicate that present prediction methods in CANSARP underestimate actual drifts by 2 to 3 times the actual length.

40|$|Reading Rescue is {{a reading}} {{intervention}} for struggling readers {{primarily in the}} 1 st grade, {{but it may be}} used for 2 nd and 3 rd grade students, and English language learners in need of remediation. The programâ€™s goal is to equip struggling readers with the tools necessary to become fluent readers and writers. A Reading Rescue student receives individual tutoring delivered mainly by certified teachers, as well as school personnel such as administrators, paraprofessionals and instructional aides. The developer of Reading Rescue, Dr. Nora Hoover, underscores the importance of the following instructional delivery model: large group instruction, small group instruction, and one-on-one tutoring for students who are unlikely to succeed in a small group or for whom small group instruction has failed. If a school strives to meet the challenge of improved reading ability for its students by the adoption of the Reading Rescue program, it enters into a 3 -year commitment that includes: ongoing professional development, summer institutes for the school-based Reading <b>Rescue</b> <b>coordinators,</b> and monitoring of program implementation.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{preventive}} educational activities {{carried by the}} Czech Republic Fire brigade. The basic duty of the Fire and Rescue service is systematic public information regarding the emergency situations. The Czech Fire and Rescue Service carries out activities, which are aimed for population, support its preparation. They are using preventive educational activities for passing out targeted information. The theoretical part contains basic information and context related with the subject. There are described legislation and internal regulations of the Fire and Rescue Service, on which basis, the prevention is regulated. Subjects engaged in preventive educational activities and organizational structure of the Czech Republic Fire and Rescue Service were briefly characterized in this part. The total concept focus of the Fire and Rescue Service on the issue was also explained. The theoretical part relies on the knowledge gained from the analysis of available literature dealing with this issue. The current state of implementation of preventive educational activities and its level due to {{the resources of the}} Fire and Rescue Service was assessed in the next part of this thesis. To achieve the objective and obtain answer to research question, the qualitative research methods were carried out. The current situation of the topic and identification of the suitable changes in direction of progress of the preventive educational activities for the future was objectively described by using the SWOT analysis. From the questionnaire survey, there were reported attitudes and expert opinions of the Fire and <b>Rescue</b> Service regional <b>coordinators.</b> Followed by analyzing and comparing of the findings from the research, was obtained a comprehensive overview of the current status of the issue and the assessment of the situation individual regions on the regional level. A research question which was examined in this thesis was whether the preventive educational activities provided by the Fire and Rescue Service perform tasks in the way, that prevents of extraordinary events. The answer to the research question was statement that the preventive educational activities, provided by Fire and Rescue Service can fulfill the obligation in preventing the extraordinary events. The results showed that the issue has not been sufficiently addressed and it is not paid enough attention to the issue by the Fire and Rescue Service. The aim {{of this study was to}} formulate proposal for improving the implementation of the preventive educational activities, the Fire and Rescue Service resulting from the latest trends. Several solutions are proposed based on the data from the survey. For example, the introduction of a new specialized course for coordinators targeted on teaching and presentation skills. There are persistently increasing demands on professional knowledge and skills of the coordinators. These skills could be fulfilled in the course. The course would content the needs of the coordinators in the performance of activities related to the issue. An important factor for the further development of opportunities is primarily to ensure the sufficient system of financial support. In providing preventive educational activities is important to choose the appropriate access to the population and appropriately select the forms, methods and ways of presenting the information communicated. The research has discovered that it is necessary to focus on specific groups of population. By creating an educational tool for foreigners and disabled residents is possible to improve their skills and to avoid the lack of protection of health and lives at extraordinary event. The proposed ways suitable for use in such activities are social networks, websites and television. These modern and attractive communication methods can be used to publish targeted articles and information or to allow the appearance of member of the Fire and Rescue Service on television broadcast...|$|R
