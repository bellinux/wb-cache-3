500|$|The film depicts Motoko's {{identity}} and ontological concerns, {{ending with the}} evolution of a being with full subjectivity, through a new form of reproduction with the Puppet Master. Austin Corbett commented on the lack of sexualization from her team as freedom from femininity, noting that Motoko is [...] "overtly feminine, and clearly non-female". In describing Motoko as a [...] "shapely" [...] and [...] "strong [...] {{at the center of the}} story" [...] who is [...] "nevertheless almost continuously nude", Roger Ebert noted that [...] "an article about anime in a <b>recent</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Film Quarterly suggests that to be a 'salary man' in modern Japan is so exhausting and dehumanizing that many men (who form the largest part of the animation audience) project both freedom and power onto women, and identify with them as fictional characters". [...] Carl Silvio has called Ghost in the Shell a [...] "resistant film", due to its inversion of traditional gender roles, its [...] "valorization of the post-gendered subject", and its de-emphasis of the sexual specificity of the material body.|$|E

The scrapbook contains a duplicate passport issued at Rangoon on December 1901 for a Mrs Gibbons, his third wife, Georgina. In 1903, Gibbons was in Ceylon. The Society of Genealogists archive contains a newspaper article titled Reminiscences of a Stamp Collector - Mr Stanley Gibbons (sic) in Colombo.

2500|$|On June 28, 1991, Petrelis held a {{press conference}} {{attended}} by the Associated Press, Tribune Broadcasting, The Washington Post, and a local NBC affiliate to out Pete Williams, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. Williams had risen to prominence during the Gulf War, acting as a Pentagon spokesperson. His homosexuality was considered an open secret in some Washington circles. Petrelis' press release stated, [...] "Pete Williams, an openly closeted gay man, hypocritically remains silent in his job as Pentagon spokesman, while the Department of Defense continues its irrational policy of ejecting thousands of gays and lesbians from the armed services." [...] At the press conference, Petrelis unfurled a poster bearing an image of Williams that read: PETE WILLIAMS ABSOLUTELY QUEER: PENTAGON SPOKESPERSON, TAP DANCER, CONSUMMATE QUEER. No one reported the story, but Petrelis returned to the Pentagon on August 6, 1991, to intercept reporters as they entered the building for a regularly scheduled Tuesday morning briefing. Petrelis held an impromptu press conference. He carried with him a box of copies of an article by Michelangelo Signorile from the most <b>recent</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the Advocate, outing Williams. Petrelis scolded the reporters for ignoring the story and urged them to ask Williams directly about his homosexuality. A half hour into Williams' briefing that day, Rolf Paasch, a foreign correspondent with Berlin's Die Tageszeitung, asked Williams if he could confirm or deny the claims that he was gay, and whether or not he had discussed possible resignation with Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Williams responded by saying he was not paid to discuss his personal life and that [...] "government people don't discuss in public whatever they may say to their bosses." ...|$|E

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, we {{read in a}} <b>recent</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> a London daily paper that John Simmons (31), a meat-salesman, was accused of assaulting an officer while in the {{discharge}} of his duty, {{at the same time}} using profane language whereby the officer went in fear of his life. Constable Riggs deposed that on the evening of the eleventh instant while he was on his beat, prisoner accosted him and, after offering to fight him for fourpence, drew off his right boot and threw it at his head. Accused, questioned by the magistrate, admitted the charge and expressed regret, pleading that he had had words with his young woman, and it had upset him.|$|E
6000|$|Three {{weeks later}} some verses of a totally {{different}} character appeared in the columns of the Daily News, signed in full 'Charles Dickens.' One Lucy Simpkins, of Bremhill (or Bremble), a parish in Wiltshire, had just previously addressed a night meeting of the wives of agricultural labourers in that county, {{in support of a}} petition for Free Trade, and her vigorous speech on that occasion inspired Dickens to write 'The Hymn of the Wiltshire Labourers,' thus offering an earnest protest against oppression. Concerning the 'Hymn,' a writer in a <b>recent</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Christmas Bells observes: 'It breathes in every line the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount, the love of the All-Father, the Redemption by His Son, and that love to God and man on which hang all the law and the prophets.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} admit that," [...] rejoined Fowler. [...] "For, {{even if you}} throw out all the {{enormous}} mass of evidence accumulated by spiritistic investigators, {{you still have the}} conversion of Wallace, Lodge, and Lombroso, not to speak of De Vesme, Venzano, and other well-known men of science, to account for. Even Crookes himself admits that nothing but some form of spirit hypothesis is capable of explaining all the phenomena; and in a <b>recent</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the Annals of Psychic Science Lombroso writes a paper making several very strong points against the biologic theory. One of these is the simultaneous occurrence of phenomena. 'Can the subconscious self act in several places at once?' he asks. A second objection {{lies in the fact that}} movements occur in opposition to the will of the psychic--as, for example, when Eusapia was transported in her chair. 'Can a man lift himself by his boot-straps?' is the question. 'The centre of gravity of a body cannot be altered in space unless acted upon by an external force. Therefore, the phenomena of levitation cannot be considered to be produced by energy emanating from the medium.'" ...|$|E
