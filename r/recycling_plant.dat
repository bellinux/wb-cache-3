Scully arrives at the <b>recycling</b> <b>plant</b> where Gates tells Kevin that he must die for the 'New Age' to come. Gates attempts to jump into a paper shredding machine with Kevin, but Kevin grabs onto the side as Gates falls into the shredder. Scully is able to pull Kevin to safety. Two days later, Scully and Kevin say goodbye. Kevin tells Scully he'll see her again. Scully goes to the confessional {{for the first time}} in years, wondering if God is speaking, but that no one is listening.|$|E

Lisa refuses the money and rips up the cheque. This causes Homer to have four {{simultaneous}} heart attacks. While in the hospital, Lisa apologizes to Homer for not accepting the money. He tells her that he understands what she did, but says that the $12,000 would have been a big financial help. Lisa replies that 10% of $120 million is actually $12 million. The hospital's public address system announces a code blue, signifying that Homer has entered cardiac arrest.|$|E

5|$|The writers {{had wanted}} an episode where Burns becomes {{bankrupt}} and shows what Burns {{would be like}} as {{a person in the}} real world. The idea with the <b>recycling</b> <b>plant</b> was that Burns did not have any sort of evil plan, he just could not help being himself. Burns really was trying to change and this was reflected in the end when he tried to give Lisa her share of the profits, with Lisa refusing. Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode. The staff joked about this being a suitable series finale, due to the episode ending with Homer suffering from another heart attack after Lisa tells Homer what 10% of Burns' $120,000,000 check really is.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, {{they shot}} the bridge battle near Bovec in the Soča Valley, Slovenia. The {{location}} {{was chosen for}} its resemblance to New Zealand. A large bridge was built, which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine. Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days, the filmmakers had around forty. The schedule was short though, but the authorities would only allow them this build time to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake. The filmmakers made a trench to change the river's course, so they could deepen the drained sides of the riverbed so it looked like one could drown in it. The crew also cut down 100 trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge; the trees were moved to another {{side of the river}} for decoration. The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled. As part of the clean-up, the cut-down trees and parts of the bridge were sent to a <b>recycling</b> <b>plant,</b> while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close-ups shot against bluescreen.|$|E

With the installation of the water <b>recycling</b> <b>plant</b> all the used water is collected through pipes and sent to the plant for biological and chemical treatment. Though not fit for drinking, recycled water is good enough for cleaning the coaches and platforms.|$|E
40|$|In the past, garbage was not {{a problem}} so {{emphasized}} by society, however, the significant increase in consumption has made waste management one of the main areas of study throughout the world. This study aimed to identify, describe and compare models of layout of the production system of <b>recycling</b> <b>plants,</b> thus providing better prospects in the design of these much needed projects in the cities of the new sustainable society that wants to build. The main object of study is the layout models of productive systems for <b>recycling</b> <b>plants</b> in order to identify, describe and compare them. To this end, we used bibliographic or secondary data, in books, periodicals, and dissertations on the theme in question. The main result was to scan the literature, with subsequent identification and description of 04 (four) layout models for <b>recycling</b> <b>plants.</b> When reviewing Layouts broached, {{it can be seen that}} there are some similarities and differences between them.

25|$|Paper {{recycling}} became common abroad {{during the}} 1980s and subsequently the Ministry of the Environment initiated proceedings {{to secure a}} source for domestic paper reuse. This led to an agreement in 1992 between Norske Skog and the ministry, in which the company obliged themselves to build a <b>recycling</b> <b>plant</b> for 100,000 tonnes, in exchange {{for access to the}} scrap paper. There was an internal consideration of which mill to build the <b>recycling</b> <b>plant</b> at, and ultimately Skogn was preferred over Follum in a board decision made in August 1993. Skogn was selected because it created mostly standard newsprint and exported to the European market which demanded high deinked pulp (DIP) content.|$|E

The site handled 163,000 tonnes of old newsprint from British Columbia and Alberta, {{as well as more}} remote sources, predominantly Minnesota and Kansas City, shipped by train to Coquitlam. Once deinkled, the pulp was sent by barge to Crofton Mill.|$|E

25|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} as NorskeCanada in 2000, when Norske Skog bought {{the majority of}} Fletcher Challenge Canada with Elk Falls Mill and Crofton Mill. The following year Pacifica Papers, operating Port Alberni Mill and Powell River Mill, was merged into the group. A <b>recycling</b> <b>plant</b> in Coquitlam was bought in 2003. The group took the Catalyst name in 2005 and the following year Norske Skog sold their shares. Snowflake Mill was bought in 2008, but in the following two years the Elk Falls, Coquitlam and one machine at Crofton were shut down. Snowflake followed suit in 2012. The reason was falling demand for newsprint and increased cost of recycled paper. Catalyst reentered US production in 2015 with the purchase of Biron Mill and Rumford Mill.|$|E

Livingstone approved of the plans a month later, and it was then motioned to then-Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, who initially delayed making a final decision. He had considered whether to refer the scheme to a public inquiry, but eventually decided not to. Planning permission was granted by Islington Council in May 2002, but local residents and ISCA launched a late challenge to the High Court, citing the plans were against the law. Duncan Ouseley dismissed the case in July 2002, paving the way for Arsenal to start work.|$|E

This significantly differs from traditionally expressed decisions of the Administration. This study employs an economic model to indicate the conditions upon which screened used timber becomes a negatively priced substance, while maintaining positive marginal productivity in <b>recycling</b> <b>plants.</b> In addition, it indicates that as the marginal capacity of <b>recycling</b> <b>plants</b> increases and approaches the output volume of used timber, screened old timber certainly becomes a valuable resource. From this analysis, we clarify that the decision of the Mito District Court can provide directives from an economic perspective...|$|R

500|$|Bulgaria {{adopted the}} Kyoto Protocol and {{achieved}} the protocol's objectives by reducing {{carbon dioxide emissions}} from 1990 to 2009 by 30 percent. However, pollution from factories and metallurgy works and severe deforestation continue to cause major problems {{to the health and}} welfare of the population. In 2013, air pollution in Bulgaria was more severe than any other European country. Urban areas are particularly affected by energy production from coal-based powerplants and automobile traffic, while pesticide usage in the agriculture and antiquated industrial sewage systems produce extensive soil and water pollution with chemicals and detergents. Bulgaria is home to Maritsa Iztok-2, a lignite-fired power station causing the highest damage costs to health and the environment in the entire European Union according to the European Environment Agency. It is the only EU member which does not recycle municipal waste, although an electronic waste <b>recycling</b> <b>plant</b> opened in June 2010. The situation has improved in recent years, and several government-funded programs have been put into place in an attempt to reduce pollution levels. According to Yale University's 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Bulgaria is a [...] "modest performer" [...] in protecting the environment.
