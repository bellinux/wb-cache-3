40|$|AbstractThis paper investigates small road haulier's spatial {{location}} and road network accessibility {{in relation to}} proposed freight consolidation centres (FCCs). For many decades, the overall load factor in freight vehicles has decreased; smaller volumes of goods have been transported over longer distances. To counteract this, a well-planned localisation of FCCs has been suggested as a measure to improve transport efficiency. Based on 3, 024 road hauliers, <b>road</b> <b>haulier</b> associations, freight forwarders, and delivery firms/couriers located in the Western part of Sweden, the analysis show {{a high concentration of}} small road hauliers towards the largest city, its immediate surroundings, and towards existing facilities of large freight forwarders and <b>road</b> <b>haulier</b> associations. Furthermore, the accessibility analysis shows that a very large majority of the small road hauliers as well as large forwarders and haulier associations are reached within a short time distance from the proposed FCCs, indicating the potential to establish FCCs serving small road hauliers. While {{it is not possible to}} conclude that the ‘proposed’ FCCs are optimally located, the paper provides a basis to further investigate the most appropriate locations of FCCs serving the city and its surroundings, and whether and under what conditions FCC establishments are viable...|$|E

The issue of cabotage could be described in three groups of topics, the first being the unified EU regulations of cabotage and conditions set {{for carrying out}} cabotage, the second concerns topics, that are similar in every EU country due to harmonization of national law, for example the payment of VAT, admission to the occupancy of <b>road</b> <b>haulier</b> or technical conditions for vehicles.

40|$|Given its {{possibilities}} of switching freight from road to more sustainable modes such as rail, inland water ways and seaways, intermodal freight transportation depends on {{environmental and economic}} variables. At the same time, intermodal freight transportation is essentially complex due to the variety of modes of transport and their corresponding actors. To reduce the complexity of such transport, the interaction of those actors and the exchange of information are crucial. In short, the more enhanced information exchange among actors, the higher potential of improving their management of access to intermodal terminals (e. g. railroad terminals and seaports). In this work, access management, refers to {{the management of the}} process of actors accessing resources for specific activities in transportation systems. Improved access management that relies upon increased information exchange among those actors might increase resource efficiency via the improved management of truck arrivals to terminals and of <b>road</b> <b>haulier</b> operations. The goal of this research is to clarify how access management affects resource efficiency in road haulage in intermodal freight transportation. Accordingly, the purpose of the research is to improve access management at intermodal freight terminals from the perspective of <b>road</b> <b>haulier</b> operators. The thesis is a compilation of three papers that reports studies involving literature reviews, participant observations, interviews, focus group meetings, and time measurements. First, literature regarding access management and information exchange for road hauliers in intermodal freight transportation was studied. Second, a framework was developed in order to sort and analyse the identified information-related attributes required to improve access management for road hauliers. Third, a differentiation and segmentation framework with corresponding strategies are devised afford a better overview for analysing different access management service used by the industry, as well as to segment access depending on whether the terminal is a railroad terminal or a seaport. Fourth, an information exchange framework was developed and implemented in a smartphone app to measure and analyse the potential operational benefits of improved access management. The major contributions of this work, except the definition of access management, are clarifications of how contemporary access is handled, how access management can be improved, and investigations of the potential operational benefits of improved access management...|$|E

40|$|Intermodal line-trains {{operating}} in corridor network designs are regularly promoted {{a means for}} intermodal transport to compete on transport costs and time with all-road transport for distances shorter than 500 km. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify existing drivers and barriers to the usage of time and cost competitive intermodal in the decision making process of <b>road</b> <b>hauliers</b> who in many cases make the modal choice, i. e. deciding whether to outsource long-distance haulage to rail as an alternative to producing road haulage itself. This paper addresses the complexity of the mode choice that is often stressed in mode choice literature but more seldom explained. It looks into the potential of using an intermodal line-train for the long-distance transport of consolidated cargo between a forwarder’s terminals. In a multiple case study, the operations of four hauliers contracted by two forwarders in Sweden for the long-distance transport on two domestic routes (Göteborg – Malmö and Örebro – Stockholm) are assessed. In semi-structured interviews with four hauliers and two forwarders the drivers and barriers in the mode choice process for a modal shift are analysed. The results indicate that consolidated cargo is generally suitable for intermodal transport, but for outsourcing the long-distance haulage to rail the <b>road</b> <b>hauliers</b> face significant obstacles. The main barriers are a vehicle fleet that is not adapted for rail transport as well as small transport volumes and time-intensive terminal access that do not allow efficient PPH. Hence, in the current industry structure the modal shift potential for consolidated cargo is limited. New business models may be needed to reach transport volumes that allow efficient PPH operations, which in turn may lead to reduced business for <b>road</b> <b>hauliers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} provide a set of {{structured}} measures for transport efficiency improvements {{from the perspective of}} the <b>road</b> <b>haulier,</b> particularly regarding improvements suitable for urban distribution and their effects, and stressing the need for the road hauliers to cooperate with other actors. The first part of the paper briefly recapitulates some of the literature within the area of transport efficiency. The second part presents potential transport efficiency improvements with respect to environmental and logistics impact. In the third section a summary of these efficiency measures is presented in a matrix, taking into account whether these measures can be seen as costs or benefits for the actors involved. The results show ambiguous and intricate relations with regards to costs and benefits for the actors in the system and could possibly explain some of the resistance to change within the freight industry. However, an increasing amount of transport operators are now offering more sustainable transport solutions, even at a lower price than ordinary deliveries, and this service might gain them a competi-tive advantage in the future...|$|E
40|$|Road {{transport}} is {{an important}} sector, connecting time and space of production and consumption. Its market conditions has changed. The EU single market implementation has increased price pressure due to supply of low cost road freight transport from counties with lower cost structures. Changes in the market also encourage strategic development of some road hauliers into providers of unique services. Such <b>road</b> <b>haulier</b> strategic development contributes to efficiency and effectiveness in basically all business sectors of EU. Little research is available of such strategic and operational management. In this paper we will explore that knowledge gap and analyze what value proposition(s) and capabilities can transform potential cost disadvantages of acting in a market that includes both high- and low-cost-country actors? And in conceptual terminology, how are capabilities deployed and developed to construct a competitive value proposition? We will illustrate the strategy-as-practice with two projects, and discuss implications in terms of capabilities needed to create an effective value proposition and hence competitiveness. The theoretical contribution is in theorizing haulier strategic development in which we take into account logistics service supplier strategic management. We also contribute with better understanding of value creation in order to escape commoditization and differentiate services through relationships (customers and/or other hauliers). Practical implications concern hauliers’ strategy creation {{and to some extent}} road transport buyers in terms of more informed market knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Road hauliers {{are under}} {{substantial}} competitive pressure. We aim {{to better understand}} <b>road</b> <b>haulier</b> competition and its implications in terms of integration and competence in the logistics service supply chain and industrial supply chain. Design/methodology/approach Comparative cases of trucking and competition are constructed from Swedish and Polish case studies (interviews, observation and secondary material). Our qualitative approach involves researchers and actors of the road transport chain that collaboratively create understanding of development in the road transport business. Findings A transaction and low cost focus might lead to prices which cannot cover the normal expenses for vehicle maintenance, salary and fuel, exploiting drivers sleeping in the truck cabins for weeks and vehicles which are not well maintained. We also find low cost and competent small transport firms driving vehicles with low environmental impact, and with good safety performance. Many industrial firms strive for integration but neglect integration of the logistics and transportation services chain, thus sacrificing integration and competence in the supply chain as well as sustainability. Research limitations/implications The study explores rather than proves shortcomings in supply chain management. Future process research approaches can facilitate theory building on operational and strategic interactions of the industrial supply chain and the logistics service chain. Practical implications By having CSR requirements but not enforcing them in the transport chain, transport buyers may be contributing {{to a system of}} extreme low cost transportation competition where long-term performance is poor especially on social and environmental aspects.

40|$|International audienceToday {{road haulage}} is France's most {{important}} transport mode, proving {{its ability to}} meet shippers' demands. Road haulage has several success factors, {{some of which are}} technical (for example, the speed and density of the motorway and road network). Others are economic (the low price or road transport). Last but not least, relationships among <b>road</b> <b>hauliers</b> {{play a major role in}} competitiveness. Among other factors, the opportunity that large companies have to subcontract with very small ones, with very low fixed costs and great flexibility, is often quoted as a major advantage. The ECHO survey, conducted in France in 2004, provides information on 10 000 shipments made by 3000 shippers. For each shipment, the survey gives details about the shipper, the shipment itself, and each company providing transport or logistics services for that shipment. The survey allows us to analyze subcontracting, by showing us each stage at which a shipment is contracted to the next carrier. This analysis reveals the frequency of subcontracting in France, and gives us the opportunity to study why subcontracts are made. Of course, some of the subcontracts are mainly cost driven. However, others aim at using the specialized skills of a particular haulier (a frequent service to a given destination, for example). Finally, the aim of some subcontracts is to increase transport chain efficiency. The usual transport segments are studied : single parcel delivery service, parcel delivery service, less than truck load, full truck load. The share of shipments and the number of tonnes which fall under the purview of subcontracting are studied. For each transport segment, subcontracting is described in terms of size of companies involved, services provided, and the reason for subcontracting.
