Like any {{rechargeable}} battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a <b>refurbished</b> unit for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping. User data is not preserved/transferred. The <b>refurbished</b> unit comes with a new case. The warranty on the <b>refurbished</b> unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: of this paper: Mainly, future {{design and}} {{manufacturing}} processes should be oriented to <b>refurbishing</b> and overhaul, such as mining machines, hydraulics, military industry, heavy industry products, etc [...] This paper shows method which can improve indirectly profitability also in environment protection area. Design/methodology/approach: Methodology that solves <b>refurbishing</b> and overhaul problem of application, {{is based on}} CAD/CAM integration, and predicts possibility to even prepare design for <b>refurbishing.</b> With help of reverse engineering techniques, also exist approach to <b>refurbish</b> elements that has no overhaul documentation prepared before. Findings: Preparation of overhaul documentation for families of constructions, should be computer aided with use of prepared dedicated software. Time need to prepare <b>refurbishing</b> technology, can be considerably reduced. Research limitations/implications: <b>Refurbishing</b> and overhaul in existence cycle of product should have same rights as technology or design processes. Future development of new <b>refurbishing</b> technologies should be prepared in software combined with CAD/CAM modules used in advanced CAE programs. Practical implications: Mining industry after possible initiate <b>refurbishing</b> methods, can extend exploit time of exerted machines. Simultaneously producers of mining machines and equipment, after bringing in design for <b>refurbishing</b> strategy in to production, can enhance economical profits from maintenance and service time prolongation. Originality/value: For last twenty years no development in area of patents were noticed. That came with increase of consumption strategy progressed by produces. Presented method solves issues of materials raise in prices and relatively short time of maintenance and service time period. New workstations in industry can be created with application of the method...|$|R
