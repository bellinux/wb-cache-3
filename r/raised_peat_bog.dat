500|$|Thorne and Hatfield Moors {{form the}} largest area of lowland <b>raised</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bog</b> in the United Kingdom. They are {{situated}} in South Yorkshire, to the north-east {{and east of}} Doncaster {{near the town of}} Thorne, and are part of Hatfield Chase. They had been used for small-scale extraction of peat for fuel from medieval times, and probably much earlier, but commercial extraction of the peat for animal bedding began in the 1880s. The peat was cut on the moors and, once it had dried, transported to several works on [...] narrow gauge tramways, always called trams locally. The wagons were pulled by horses to works at Creyke's Siding, Moorends, Medge Hall, Swinefleet and Hatfield. There was also a network of canals supplying the Moorends Works.|$|E
500|$|Thorne Moors and Hatfield Moors {{together}} cover {{an area of}} some , and are a small {{remnant of}} a much larger wetland system that once covered around [...] known as the Humberhead Levels. The moors lie to the east of the town of Thorne and the M18 motorway. Thorne Moors are situated {{to the north of the}} M180 motorway, while Hatfield Moors lie to the south of that road. Although much reduced in size, they are still the largest area of lowland <b>raised</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bog</b> in the United Kingdom, the third largest being the well-preserved Fenn's, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses, a national nature reserve of [...] 948 hectares (2340 acres) which straddles the border between England and Wales, near Whixall and Ellesmere in Shropshire, England and Bettisfield in Wrexham County Borough, Wales.|$|E

5000|$|Burns Bog is an ombrotrophic {{peat bog}} located in Delta, British Columbia, Canada. It {{is the largest}} <b>raised</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bog</b> and the largest undeveloped urban land mass on the West Coast of the Americas. Burns Bog was {{originally}} 10000 - 12000 acre before development. Currently, only 3,500 ha remain of the bog. [...] Burns Bog is habitat to more than 300 plant and animal species, and 175 bird species. Some of these animals are listed as endangered (i.e. red-listed) or vulnerable (i.e. blue-listed) under the BC Provincial Government Species at-risk designations. The bog is also a major migratory stopover for various bird species on the Pacific Flyway. [...] Burns Bog regulates water as well. The bog prevents flooding, maintains cool water temperatures in nearby rivers, holds water, and releases water in dry conditions. Burns Bog is an estuarine bog since it is situated {{at the mouth of}} the Fraser River and next to the Pacific Ocean. It is the only estuarine <b>raised</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bog</b> formed in a marine west coast climate.|$|E

A boardwalk allows visitors to walk over the reserve safely while observing the wildlife which lives on the Moss - many species here occur only in Bog habitats making this site one of special importance. Located just south of East Kilbride, the reserve is accessed easiest from the A726, heading towards Langlands Golf Course & Auldhouse.|$|E
40|$|Bog mosses (Sphagnum species) are {{sensitive}} to the position of local water-tables on intact <b>raised</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bogs.</b> These <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> are rain-fed, receiving all their water through precipitation alone. After death, the mosses are remarkably well preserved, since they are resistant to decay, and micro-organisms that are capable of decomposing them are inhibited by the acidity and lack of oxygen in the peat pore water. Continual growth of the <b>peat</b> <b>bog</b> surface and burial of dead organic matter has led to peat sequences that can exceed 10 m in depth. Because the age of these deposits can be accurately determined by measuring their residual radiocarbon activity, they have been used by peatland scientists to reconstruct changes in climate, given the sensitivity of bog mosses to changes in temperature and rainfall. This research provides long-term evidence for climate change, given that the oldest instrumental temperature record (Central England Temperature record) goes back only as far as 1659 CE (Common Era), while the majority of instrumental records only extend to the late 19 th century...|$|R
40|$|Plant macrofossil remains {{have been}} {{analysed}} from two <b>raised</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> in northern Germany and Denmark. The quantified vegetation reconstructions of each profile {{were subjected to}} multivariate analyses to extract records of changing bog surface wetness (BSW), which are interpreted in these rain-fed bogs as being proxy climate signals. Age/depth models were constructed using radiocarbon dates {{and a number of}} drier and wetter phases were defined. The records both register cooler/wetter conditions around 2700, 1800 and 1400 cal. yr BP, and {{at the beginning of the}} Little Ice Age around AD 1250 - 1350. These rising bog water tables must have been reflected in poorer conditions for agriculture, and in particular near Dosenmoor where the profile records a catastrophic change to such conditions culminating at 2750 - 2600 cal. yr BP...|$|R
40|$|Closely spaced {{sequences}} of accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) 14 C dates of peat deposits display century-scale wiggles {{which can be}} fitted to the radiocarbon calibration curve. By wiggle-matching such sequences, high-precision calendar age chronologies can be generated which show that changes in mire surface wetness during the Bronze Age/Iron Age transition (c. 850 cal. bc) and the ‘Little Ice Age’ (Wolf, Spörer, Maunder and Dalton Minima) occurred during periods of suddenly increasing atmospheric concentration of 14 C. Replicate evidence from peat-based proxy climate indicators in northwest Europe suggest these changes in climate may have been driven by temporary declines of solar activity. Carbon-accumulation rates of two <b>raised</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> in the UK and Denmark record low values during the ‘Little Ice Age’ which reflects reduced primary productivity of the peat-forming vegetation during these periods of climatic deterioration. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{method that}} could be used to detect the change of the {{environment}} was used to determine the input of trace elements from the atmospheric fallouts into the biosphere near Tomsk city (West Siberia, Russia) during the last century. In this study we used high-moor peat formations because of the wide-spread occurrence of bogs in this region. Investigations of the <b>raised</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> in areas with different degree of anthropogenic impact showed that the distribution of trace elements in the upper parts of peat deposits depends on the location of bogs towards industrial sources. The highest concentrations of Ca, Fe, Cr, Co, Sc, Hf and rare earth elements were found in the upper part of the bog located near the city Tomsk. Distribution of trace elements in the vertical profiles of <b>raised</b> <b>peat</b> deposits near cities Tomsk and Seversk reflects the industrial specialization of these cities and the dynamic of the atmosphere pollution. Studies of radioactive elements ( 137 Cs, 238 Pu, 239 Pu) have indicated their inputs from global fallouts...|$|R
5000|$|The Šumava Range {{is covered}} by the most {{extensive}} forest in Central Europe, whose natural composition was, however, changed and today spruce plantations prevail {{in most of the}} area. In many places non-native spruce varieties were planted. These are not well adapted to the harsh local climate and are therefore susceptible to a range of elements, such as strong winds (e.g. in the 1980s or recently at the beginning of 2007) and bark beetle (Ips typographus). Numerous large plateaux with <b>raised</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bogs,</b> glacial lakes and remnants of primeval forests (e.g. Boubín) complete a mosaic of habitats which are little disturbed by human settlements as most of the predominantly German speaking inhabitants were expelled after the World War II and the area became a part of the deserted zone along the Eastern Bloc border.

40|$|Quantitative plant macrofossil, {{colorimetric}} humification and testate amoebae analyses {{have been}} used to reconstruct proxy climate records from two <b>raised</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> in the Scottish Borders, Raeburn Flow and Bell’s Flow. Detrended correspondence analysis was used to transform the raw floral data into latent indices of mire surface wetness. The chronology of each peat profile was determined by radiocarbon assay, supported by pollen/landuse correlations. The palaeoclimate reconstructions generated from Raeburn Flow and Bell’s Flow match some of those previously generated from Coom Rigg Moss and Felecia Moss in northern England, although the latter sites register more climatic deteriorations since ca. 850 cal. BC. The water balance, size, and shape of each site have been investigated in an attempt to explain the differences between their palaeoclimatic records. The absence of potential summer water deficits may explain the greater palaeoclimatic sensitivity of Coom Rigg Moss and Felecia Moss, as the Sphagnum mosses may experience optimal growth conditions at those two sites. <br/...|$|R

50|$|Despite its {{alternative}} name, {{as well as}} its saline wetlands Mandora Marsh {{includes a}} number of permanent or almost permanent freshwater swamps supplied by springs along the southern side of the two main lakes. The springs are usually formed of a central, raised mound, 2-3 m high, of saturated peat, supporting a mixture of Melaleuca and Sesbania trees, with mangroves appearing at the saline and brackish springs. The springs vary in size from 0.1 to several hectares; each spring's mound is generally surrounded by a moat, varying from a maximum depth of 50 cm to isolated shallow pools or just wet soil. Many springs also support small stands of cumbungi with the understories of some dominated by the fern Achrostichum speciosum. Thickets of saltwater paperbark are found where flood waters remain longest; stock watering bores have been established in these thickets and the watering troughs are used by waterbirds throughout the year. The most spectacular of the springs is Mandora Soak, a <b>raised</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bog</b> estimated to be 7000 years old.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSeveral {{laboratory}} experiments and field observations demonstrate that saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi effectively use pollen cytoplasm and suggest pollen produced by wind-pollinated trees {{as a crucial}} nutrient source for fungi and their plant hosts in nutrient-limited environments. However, the role of such interactions is still underestimated or neglected in ecology and paleoecology. Here, we consider pollen attacked by fungi in palynological records from Holocene <b>raised</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> as a nutrient source for ecosystems in the past. The attacks occurred through the pollen germination areas {{by a variety of}} saprotrophic, ericoid mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal or dark septate endophyte fungi. Large amounts of attacked pollen in phases rich in Calluna vulgaris highlight the importance of Ericaceae shrubs, hosting ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and forming hotspots of decomposition in nutrient-deficit bogs. Applying estimations of pollen rain from literature, and based on own observed pollen infection rates we estimate the annual release of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium from pollen, and highlight their significance in pushing the ecosystem nutrient cycle in early spring time, when several species release their pollen. We highlight the significant role of anthropogenic changes in pollen deposition for pre-industrial bogs and hypothesize about the consequences of the pollen-based interrelation between wind-pollinated plants and their mycorrhizal fungi in paleoecology and evolution.

Nine wet-shifts identified in the monoliths from Walton Moss and Lille Vildmose mainly occurred during periods of increasing atmospheric 14 C content. Because fluctuations in Holocene atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations {{have been shown to be}} due to variations in solar activity, the Little Ice Age (LIA) climatic deteriorations registered in both peat bogs were probably driven by changes in solar activity. Climatic deteriorations in the three replicate cores from Walton Moss are not all consistently registered and may reflect the internal variability in the extent of hollow/lawn/hummock microforms within raised peat-bog ecosystems. The lowest carbon accumulation values for the Walton Moss monoliths between ca. cal AD 1300 and 1800 and between ca. cal AD 1490 and 1580 for Lille Vildmose occurred during the course of LIA climatic deteriorations. Peat-bog primary productivity may have been reduced during the LIA owing to lower spring-summer temperatures and shorter growing seasons for the peat-forming plants. Species-specific higher decomposition rates may have also caused the lower carbon accumulation rates in the peat bogs during the LIA. ...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{development}} and anthropogenic activity {{have a huge}} impact on the environment, forcing society to find new and cost-effective environment treatment technologies.

In this study we have determined the sorption characteristics of Ca, Mg, K, Na, Cu and Pb and results show that fen peat deposits have a huge variability as a biosorbent due to their variable botanical composition and complex properties, for instance, under equal conditions, wood-sedge peat can have higher lead adsorption capacity than wood peat.
