Three studies evaluated the teaching conditions of conditional discriminations with printed and spoken pseudowords that could potentially generate recombinative reading. Fifty-four college students across all studies learned to match 12 printed pseudowords to 12 spoken pseudowords. Some also matched pictures to the same spoken words. Each two-syllable pseudoword was formed by symbols from an arbitrarily created alphabet composed of four vowels and four consonants. Letters had univocal correspondence with phonemes. Recombinative <b>receptive</b> <b>reading,</b> comprehensive reading, and textual responding to pseudowords were periodically assessed. Experiment 1 (n  =  20) showed that recombinative reading increased {{as the number of}} trained words composed of the same symbols increased.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} incidental receptive and productive learning tasks on reading comprehension {{and the use of}} taught words in writing in Persian EFL learners with different proficiency levels. To this end, a quick Oxford Placement Test (OPT) was administered to the junior students population studying English teaching in Khorasgan Azad university and based on their OPT scores, two samples of 40 male and female students were selected and assigned to low intermediate and high intermediate group. The students in each group were randomly divided into two equal groups of 20 each. One group in each proficiency level was taught 15 target words receptively, while another group learned the same target words productively. After the treatments, two tests measuring reading comprehension and writing were administered to each group. The Scores of the groups in each level were analyzed via a one-way MANOVA. The results indicated that both proficiency groups who had learned their target words productively outperformed the receptive participants on the writing test significantly. Similarly, the <b>receptive</b> <b>reading</b> groups did significantly better on the comprehension tests. The findings of this study revealed that receptive vocabulary learning may be more beneficial to understanding a text and productive learning is more effective in improving the use of students’ taught words in writing. Moreover, it was found that proficiency would be of little significance in the interaction between vocabulary learning task and communicative gains of learners...|$|E

40|$|This {{interdisciplinary}} research develops and puts forward an exploratory analysis of three styles of urban dance: liquid, digitz, and finger tutting using Laban Movement Analysis, a rigorous methodology for analyzing human movement. I suggest that perceptual and cognitive principles, particularly Gestalt laws of perceptual {{organization and the}} spatial cognition principle of ‘structure from motion’, explain and underlie the visual expressive and communicative strength of these styles through a process I describe as dance illusioning. I put forward three dance illusioning modes: spatial tangibilization, rejointing, and spatial quantization. Furthermore, I develop a novel approach to explaining the effects of technology on dance praxis through a close reading of ethnographic and archival data in conjunction with structuralist and cognitive approaches for analyzing urban dance. I provide evidence on how the styles have historical connections with technological aesthetics and how the urban dance community have in part used technological themes to define their bodies and their movement philosophies. I therefore argue that the styles elicit a <b>receptive</b> <b>reading</b> of the dancing body as cyborgean {{in that it is}} simultaneously organic and technological, and of the performance environment as virtually constituted in that it contains invisible, mutable objects and structures that are revealed only through the dancers’ movement. In doing so, I contribute to scholarly perspectives on the historical interactions between technology and dance performance. I conclude by outlining directions for further research and propose that illusion-based dance as a community of practice embodies movement expertise that is of value for technology design...|$|E

According to the Common European Framework, such skills can be grouped into productive and <b>receptive.</b> <b>Reading</b> and Listening are categorized as receptive skills, while speaking and writing are productive skills. Experience and research findings suggest that most learners of English as {{a foreign language}} (EFL) find productive skills more difficult to develop than receptive skill, and writing skills the hardest to improve. Learning to write is a complex process that calls {{for a wide range of}} cognitive and linguistic strategies to be used, most of which EFL students are not fully aware of. Difficulties in crafting a text often arise from students’ unawareness of how to organize ideas logically in English so as to make the information in the text flow smoothly, and of the linguistic features that cause the discourse to sound foreign. All claims in a written text should be relevant and related to the topic (unity). All sentences must also be arranged in a logical order and connected to each other to create a smooth transition (coherence) throughout the text. The second level of challenge is the use of linguistic features (suitable vocabulary, appropriate collocations and patterns, and correct structures); these are frequent sources of mistakes that make a text sound foreign and often hard to understand. Gass and Selinker (1994) claim that many EFL learners “find themselves without the linguistic resources” to express their ideas. The purpose of this talk is to help EFL college majors become aware of the relevance of how to organize ideas according to the logical patterns of development in English. Different short texts will be analyzed to identify the strengths and weaknesses in each case.

The parents responded to questionnaires regarding previous history for language/reading impairment and participated in psychometric testing. The psychometric test battery consisted of tests assessing non-verbal IQ, short-term memory, articulation, <b>receptive</b> grammar, <b>reading</b> abilities and spelling. Self-report measures demonstrated a higher prevalence of language and literacy impairments in parents of affected probands (32 %) compared with parents of unaffected probands (6 %). The two groups of parents differed significantly in their performance on the non-word repetition, oromotor and digit span tasks. Non-word repetition gave the best discrimination between the parent groups even when the data from the parents who actually were impaired as ascertained by direct testing or self-report were removed from the analyses.
