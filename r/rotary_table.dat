25|$|Instead, {{typically}} a dedicated machine tool is used. It has {{four to eight}} spindles and usually a <b>rotary</b> <b>table.</b> The cycle time {{for this type of}} setup is determined by the longest individual operation, which in this situation is determined by {{how long it takes to}} plunge and retract the tool through the bore. Throughput can be increased by completing two workpieces on each cycle; this is achieved by having two identical stations for each tool size so that two workpieces can be operated on concurrently.|$|E

[...] The dual column setup is unable to make use of a miter base due to inherent design. [...] Dual column saws are the largest variety of machine bandsaws encountered, to the point where some make use of a <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> and X axis to perform complex cutting.|$|E
60|$|However, if I {{allowed myself}} to go on about the cats of Rome, either ancient or modern, {{there would be no}} end. For instance, in a statuary's shop in the Via Sistina there is a large yellow cat, which I one day saw {{dressing}} the hair of the statuary's boy. It performed this office with a very motherly anxiety, seated {{on the top of a}} high <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> where ordinarily the statuary worked at his carving, and pausing from time to time, as it licked the boy's thick, black locks, to get the effect of its labors. On other days or at other hours it slept under the table-top, unvexed by the hammering that went on over its head. Even in Rome, where cats are so abundant, it was a notable cat.|$|E

5000|$|Floor mill These have {{a row of}} <b>rotary</b> <b>tables,</b> and a {{horizontal}} pendant spindle mounted {{on a set of}} tracks that runs parallel to the table row. These mills have predominantly been converted to CNC, but some can still be found (if one can even find a used machine available) under manual control. The spindle carriage moves to each individual table, performs the machining operations, and moves to the next table while the previous table is being set up for the next operation. Unlike other mills, floor mills have movable floor units. A crane drops massive <b>rotary</b> <b>tables,</b> X-Y tables, etc., into position for machining, allowing large and complex custom milling operations.|$|R
