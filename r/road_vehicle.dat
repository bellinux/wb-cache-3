5|$|Although closed, {{the line}} was not lifted, and was {{maintained}} as a long siding until 1972, {{on behalf of the}} Central Electricity Generating Board, who paid for its maintenance. This was to facilitate the maintenance of the stators from Keadby Power Station, which were too heavy to be transported over the bridge where the A161 road crossed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. When required, the heavy haulage company Pickfords would move a stator by road to Ealand depot, to the south of Crowle. It would then be loaded onto the railway, and moved across the canal to Belton, where it would be transferred back to the <b>road</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The A161 road bridge was replaced by Lindsey County Council in 1970, and the complicated manoeuvres became unnecessary. Consequently, the rails were removed in 1972.|$|E

5000|$|A car shuttle train (not to be {{confused}} with a Motorail service) is a train used to transport <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> a relatively short distance while accompanied by their occupants. Car shuttle trains commonly operate through a rail tunnel connecting two places not easily accessible to each other by road. This type of rail service usually transports accompanied freight carrying <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> as well as passenger carrying vehicles. However, transport of freight carrying <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> on car shuttle trains is not always strictly combined transport, because the car shuttle train trip may be {{only a small fraction of}} the freight carrying <b>road</b> <b>vehicle's</b> overall journey.|$|R
5|$|Just before Godnow Swing Bridge, the {{northern}} soak drain {{crosses to the}} north side of the railway. As the canal approaches Ealand there are some large lakes to the north, which are now used for sailing. Crowle Bridge carries the A161 road over the railway and the canal, and Crowle railway station is sandwiched between the canal and the North Soak Drain. A little further east are the remains of Crowle railway bridge. It carried the Axholme Joint Railway over the canal, and consisted of four arches built from bricks, with a central swinging section, to allow keels to sail along the canal. The bridge was retained after the railway was closed in 1966, because stators from Keadby Power Station were too heavy to be transported over the A161 road bridge. The stators were carried by road to Ealand, loaded onto the railway, and crossed the bridge to Belton, where they were transferred back to a <b>road</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The process became unnecessary when Lindsey County Council rebuilt the A161 bridge in 1970, and the railway bridge was demolished in 1972.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} type of diesel fuel is a {{specific}} fractional distillate of petroleum fuel oil, but alternatives that are not derived from petroleum, such as biodiesel, biomass to liquid (BTL) or gas to liquid (GTL) diesel, are increasingly being developed and adopted. To distinguish these types, petroleum-derived diesel is increasingly called petrodiesel. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) is a standard for defining diesel fuel with substantially lowered sulfur contents. As of 2016, almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in UK, Europe and North America is of a ULSD type. In the UK, diesel fuel for on-road use is commonly abbreviated DERV, standing for diesel-engined <b>road</b> <b>vehicle,</b> which carries a tax premium over equivalent fuel for non-road use. In Australia diesel fuel is also known as distillate, and in Indonesia, it is known as Solar, a trademarked name by the local oil company Pertamina.|$|E
25|$|The Holden Commodore is {{the current}} generic <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> of choice for the police. In the past they have used Ford Falcons and the Nissan Maxima. The highway patrol mainly uses the Holden Commodore S variant along with the Holden VF Commodore. The police also use unmarked models of the Holden Cruze and Holden Commodore. Liveries are {{chequered}} Battenburg markings orange-blue (older models - VT, VX and VZ Commodores) or yellow-blue (Newer Models, Captiva, Commodore VE and VF, trucks and vans), as well as cars in standard factory colours, {{commonly referred to as}} unmarked or undercover. Since 2008 the orange-blue livery is being phased out, and all marked patrol vehicles were expected to have the yellow-blue livery as well as LED light bars by 2014. Both Commodore sedan and wagon bodies are used - normally in V6 form. The Holden Commodore (VE, VT, VX and VZ) is currently being phased starting 2013 and slowly being replaced with Holden VF Commodores. The Holden Cruze is currently only used for Youth Aid, both marked and unmarked.|$|E
