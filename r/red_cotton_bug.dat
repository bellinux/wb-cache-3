50|$|The Institute {{has made}} {{tremendous}} efforts in popularizing {{the technology for}} herbicide use in weed management. The continuous research on screening of weedicides and fine tuning of their application techniques (pre- and post-emergence) is another milestone of this Institute. The quantification of optimized fertilizer levels, application methodologies for efficient utilization and exploring the alternate nutrient sources remained as a continuous endeavor to achieve yield sustainability. The technique of plant mapping, disseminated from this Institute, for forecasting/ estimating yield potential is being practiced by the various research, academia and government departments. In the field of plant protection, the invasion of secondary pests like mealybug, dusky cotton bug and <b>red</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>bug</b> are becoming potential threats to achieve yield targets. A due attention is being made to devise pest management strategies to tackle these emerging pests. In the scenario of extended Bt cotton cultivation, the research has been diverted towards this new dimension for controlling sucking pests and studies on resistance management accrued due to inbuilt bollworm resistance in cotton plant. The country has suffered huge financial losses due to yield reduction in cotton crop caused by the wide scale infestation of cotton leaf curl virus (CLCuV) disease. Accepting this hard challenge, the scientists at the Institute were able to evolve varieties through introgression that have {{a high degree of}} tolerance to CLCuV. A variety Cyto-124, which is recently recommended by Expert Sub Committee, has shown its stability towards virus tolerance in early as well as late sowing (March to June planting). A couple of more promising genotypes (Cyto-120 & Cyto-122) are in pipeline. The contribution in the development of disease resistance is the outcome of continuous involvement by the Pathology Section for quantification and transformation of resistant character and its build up in the new genetic material.|$|E
40|$|Dusky bug (Oxycarenus laetus) and red cotton bugs (Dysdercus koingii) are {{commonly}} known as seed bugs because they feed on cotton seed. They have become major threat to cotton in Pakistan since last two years. The present studies were therefore planned to find out the role of sowing dates in cotton pest population. The dusky and <b>red</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>bug</b> population varied considerably with respect to date of sowing. The results revealed that invasion of both bugs was significantly more in case of early sowing (up to 15 red cotton bug/plant & 25 dusky bugs/boll) than in normal and late sowing (8 to 10 red cotton bugs & 10 to 12 dusky bug/boll respectively). Sampling dates exhibited that population of cotton bugs (dusky and <b>red</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>bug)</b> was higher during first week of October followed by mid September, 2013, whereas lower in late sowing. Varietal comparison depicted that FH- 118 and FH- 142 showed non significant difference for red and dusky cotton bug population. The results further explained that peak population of <b>red</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>bug</b> was recorded during the month of October, 2013...|$|E
40|$|Insect-resistant genetically {{engineered}} cottons expressing ?-endotoxins from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{have been adopted}} {{on a large scale}} worldwide. The effects of Bt cotton on non-target insect pests, generalist predators, arthropod diversity and toxin flow through different trophic levels under insecticide protected and unprotected conditions was studied. The populations of major non-target insect pests (leafhoppers, whiteflies, ash weevils, aphids, dusky and <b>red</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>bug,</b> and green bug) and the generalist predators (ladybirds, chrysopids, and spiders) did not differ significantly between the Bt and non-Bt cottons, while their numbers were lower in insecticide protected than under unprotected conditions, except for aphids and whiteflies. Although, Bt toxin was detected in some insect species, no significant differences were observed in their abundance on Bt and non-Bt cottons. Species richness and diversity of plant inhabiting and soil dwelling arthropods was similar in Bttransgenic and non-transgenic cottons, except in a few cases. The Bt-transgenic cotton was effective for the management of bollworms, without any major adverse effects on the non-target arthropods...|$|E
50|$|Plant {{protection}} {{strategy and}} activities have significant {{importance in the}} overall crop production programmes for sustainable agriculture. Variation of Bt gene expression in different cultivars over time and efficacy to bollworms are the main concern nowadays, studies undertaken on Earias spp proved the concerned. Similarly the efficacy of Bt cotton {{in the field is}} losing efficacy against the pink bollworm, survey conducted revealed high infestations in green bolls. Monitoring of lepidopterous pest population viz sex pheromone and light traps was carried out and forecast the increasing trend in all bollworms population. Studies on <b>red</b> and dusky <b>cotton</b> <b>bugs</b> continued and efforts are made to find bio agents for long term solutions. Seed treatment effect and development of natural on early and normal planting studies revealed that the population of jassid was more on early sown field than normal sowing also the natural fauna was recorded higher in the early sown. The distinct efforts of researchers of the section have proved meaningful in devising pest management strategies against common and new emerging insect pests through application of IPM. Studies are continued on host plant tolerance of CCRI, Multan and National Coordinated Bt. & non-Bt. Strains. The section also studied effect of different IPM strategies on insect pest for transgenic cotton. Screening of new insecticides was also conducted against major insect pests of cotton.|$|R

40|$|Colocasia esculenta tuber {{agglutinin}} (CEA), a mannose binding lectin, exhibits insecticidal efficacy against different hemipteran pests. Dysdercus cingulatus, <b>red</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>bug</b> (RCB), {{has also}} shown significant susceptibility to CEA intoxication. However, the molecular basis behind such entomotoxicity of CEA has not been addressed adequately. The present study elucidates the mechanism of insecticidal efficacy of CEA against RCB. Confocal and scanning electron microscopic analyses documented CEA binding to insect midgut tissue, resulting in an alteration of perimicrovillar membrane (PMM) morphology. Internalization of CEA into insect haemolymph and ovary was documented by western blotting analyses. Ligand blot followed by mass spectrometric identification revealed the cognate binding partners of CEA as actin, ATPase and cytochrome P 450. Deglycosylation and mannose inhibition assays indicated the interaction to probably be mannose mediated. Bioinformatic identification of putative glycosylation or mannosylation sites in the binding partners further supports the sugar mediated interaction. Correlating entomotoxicity of CEA with immune histological and binding assays to the insect gut contributes {{to a better understanding}} of the insecticidal potential of CEA and endorses its future biotechnological application...|$|E
40|$|Salmalia malabarica. <b>Red</b> <b>Cotton</b> <b>Bug,</b> Dysdercus koenigii F., (Hemiptera: Pyrrhocoridae) {{also called}} cotton stainer is a {{destructive}} pest of cotton {{and many other}} economical crops in Asia. D. koenigii feeds {{on a variety of}} hosts including cotton. It damages the crop by sucking sap and staining lint by its faeces. Being important pest of many important crops, the present work was planned to study the comparative biology and biometrics most appropriate word of D. koenigii on cotton, okra and simal under laboratory condition. Significantly lesser nymphal duration was observed in cotton 23. 42 ± 1. 38 days as compared to okra and simal 28. 20 ± 2. 08 and 28. 39 ± 1. 96 days respectively. The longer adult life was observed on cotton (female 20. 85 ± 6. 17 days and male 16. 18 ± 6. 11 days) and simal (female 20. 11 ± 3. 19 days and male 15. 41 ± 2. 37 days) than the okra (female 17. 60 ± 2. 58 days and male 10. 92 ± 2. 49 days). In case of cotton D. koenigii mates three times in its life, while in case of okra it mates 1 - 2 times and it mates only once in its life period in case of Simal. Numbers of eggs laid were significantly higher in case of cotton 109. 06 ± 32. 60 as compared to okra (52. 93 ± 8. 72 eggs) and simal (43. 63 ± 13. 29 eggs). Better vigor was observed in case of case of cottonseeds. Biology and life cycle studies on different hosts will help researchers and farmers to develop IPM strategies accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Effectiveness of {{transgenic}} cottons with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cry 1 Ac gene {{along with}} non-transgenic commercial cultivars of Gossypium hirsutum and G. arboreum {{for the management}} of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera was evaluated at the research farm, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, Patancheru, Andhra Pradesh, India. In general, {{there were no significant differences}} in oviposition between the transgenic and the non-transgenic cultivars under protected and unprotected conditions. The larval numbers were significantly lower on the transgenic hybrids during the 2004 rainy season under high infestation, but the differences in larval density between the transgenic and non-transgenic hybrids during 2002 and 2003 seasons under low levels of infestation were quite small. Bollworm damage in squares and bolls was significantly lower in the transgenic hybrids than in the non-transgenic ones, although there were a few exceptions. Differences in seed cotton yield between the transgenic and the non-transgenic hybrids were not significant under unprotected conditions at moderate levels of infestation during the 2002 and 2003 cropping seasons (except in the case of Mech 184). However, significant differences in seed cotton yield were observed during the 2004 cropping season under heavy bollworm infestation. Seed cotton yield of the first picking in transgenic hybrids was significantly greater than that of the non-transgenic counterparts. Transgenic hybrids suffered low shoot damage by spotted bollworm, Earias vittella. However, there were no differences between the transgenic and non-transgenic hybrids in their relative susceptibility to cotton jassid, Amrasca biguttula biguttula and serpentine leaf miner, Liriomyza trifolii, white fly, Bemisia tabaci, green bug, Nezara viridula, ash weevil, Myllocerus undecimpustulatus, and <b>red</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>bug,</b> Dysdercus koenigii. With a few exceptions, the bollworm damage and seed cotton yield of the G. arboreum varieties Aravinda and MDL 2450, and the G. hirsutum variety L 604 was not significantly different than that of the transgenic hybrids, and these varieties were also resistant to cotton jassid. The results suggested that it would be useful to combine transgenic resistance to H. armigera with plant characteristics conferring resistance to the target or non-target insect pests in the region in order to realize the full potential of transgenic plants for sustainable crop production...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. - The {{researchers}} and progressive farmers of cotton growers of Punjab, Pakistan had been worrying {{for six years}} from 2005 to 2010 for an obscure causing agent of the warts and internal lint damage (rotting) of cotton bolls. Consequently, a two years study was launched in 2010 and 2011 thoroughly aimed at investigating the actual causing insect pest of warts on the internal carpel wall of cotton bolls. The cotton stainer, Dysdercus koenigii F., (Hemiptera: Pyrrhocoridae), dusky <b>cotton</b> <b>bug,</b> Oxycarenus spp. (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) and stink bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) were considered as the suspected insect pests and were planned to be caged.
