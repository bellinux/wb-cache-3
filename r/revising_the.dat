5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed.

The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E

5|$|However, the peels will degrade {{over time}} if they contain any iron sulfide (pyrite or marcasite). Shya Chitaley {{addressed}} {{this problem by}} <b>revising</b> <b>the</b> liquid-peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by the coal ball from the inorganic minerals, including iron sulfide. This allows the peel to retain its quality for a longer time. Chitaley's revisions begin after grinding {{the surface of the}} coal ball to a smooth finish. Her process essentially entails heating and then making multiple applications of solutions of paraffin in xylene to the coal ball. Each subsequent application has a greater concentration of paraffin in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade the coal ball. Nitric acid, and then acetone, are applied to the coal ball. Following that, the process merges back into the liquid peel technique.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, the British {{administration}} drew up an urban plan for the development of Chamba.

The next fourteen years in particular, until his retirement in March 1877, were characterised by large-scale building projects in Chamba, with Reid fully <b>revising</b> <b>the</b> administrative and revenue departments of Chamba and reorganizing the state machinery to make development more efficient.|$|E

5|$|Kirby's Block Ball is a 1995 action video game, a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Kirby {{series for the}} Game Boy portable console. It is a Breakout clone; the player controls paddles along the screen's edge to knock a bouncing ball, Kirby, into destructible bricks. The game's 55 levels include power-ups, bonus rounds, and minigames. Kirby's Block Ball was developed by HAL Laboratory and Nintendo R. The team spent half a year <b>revising</b> <b>the</b> gameplay to match Kirby's signature characteristics. Kirby's Block Ball was published by Nintendo first in Japan in 1995, later in Europe, and last in North America in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by HAL Laboratory with Gunpei Yokoi's Nintendo R, and published by Nintendo. At one point in development, HAL decided that the game did not feel like a Kirby game. The team spent six months completely <b>revising</b> <b>the</b> game under explicit instructions on how Kirby should move. Kirby games contain elements of unrestricted, creative movement as a general theme. Kirby's Block Ball was released for the Game Boy first in Japan in 1995 and later in Europe (1995) and North America (May 1996). It was later emulated on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console, and released first in Japan (October 2011) and later in Europe (February 2012) and North America (May 2012).|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Æthelburg's {{marriage}} being dependent on Edwin {{allowing her to}} practice her faith has been questioned, since <b>revising</b> <b>the</b> chronology makes it likely, though not certain, that the marriage was arranged before Eadbald's conversion. In this view, {{it would have been}} the church that objected to the marriage, and Æthelburg would have been Christian before Eadbald's conversion. The story of Paulinus's consecration is also problematic as he was not consecrated until at least 625 and possibly later, which is after the latest possible date for Æthelburg's marriage. However, it may be that he traveled to Northumbria prior to his consecration and only later became bishop.|$|E

5|$|The {{worldwide}} {{demand for}} Champagne has been continuously increasing throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. A record in worldwide shipping of Champagne (including domestic French consumption) of 327 million bottles {{was set in}} 1999 in anticipation of end of millennium celebrations, and a new record was set in 2007 at 338.7 million bottles. Since the entire vineyard area authorized by the 1927 AOC regulations is now planted, various ways of expanding the production have been considered.

5|$|A Hero's Song was Dvořák's last orchestral {{work and}} the final of his five symphonic poems, the others being The Water Goblin, The Noon Witch, The Golden Spinning Wheel, and The Wild Dove (Opp. 107–110). It is also the last {{instance}} of him writing purely instrumental music, as he dedicated himself to vocal and operatic works after its completion. He began working on the piece on August 4, 1897, immediately after <b>revising</b> <b>the</b> third act of his opera The Jacobin. The work was completed in three months, during which time Dvořák lived at his summer residence {{in his hometown of}} Příbram, and spent time at his chateau of the patron Josef Hlávka in Lužany. The piece was completed on October 25 of the same year, and was published in 1899 by Fritz Simrock in Berlin. The symphonic poem coincidentally anticipated Richard Strauss's similar tone poem Ein Heldenleben (A Hero's Life), which was composed a year later. In fact, Dvořák originally intended to title the piece A Hero's Life, a name which had been suggested to him by his pupil Vítězslav Novák.|$|E
5|$|Casey {{returned}} to Washington, D.C. in October 1940 to become {{chief of the}} Design and Engineering Section in the Construction Division of the Office of the Quartermaster General, under Brigadier General Brehon B. Somervell. An enormous construction program was underway {{to meet the needs}} of World War II. Working with a staff that included George Bergstrom, a former president of the American Institute of Architects, Casey set about <b>revising</b> <b>the</b> standard designs for barracks. A number of new features were added to improve comfort, safety, and durability. Substitutions were made for scarce materials. It was discovered that the standard 63-man barracks was now too small. Of the 81 companies in the new triangular division, 51 fitted more easily into 74-man barracks. By slightly increasing the barracks size, substantial savings were made by reducing the overall number of buildings that needed to be constructed, the size of the cantonment areas required, and the length of required roads and utility lines. Casey was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 8 April 1941.|$|E
