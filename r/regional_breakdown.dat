40|$|The media {{measurement}} {{industry is}} in turmoil, {{with the old}} prediction-based models being challenged by more accurate measurement techniques, based on actual viewer behaviour drawn from much larger sample selections. As measurement methods converge across different types of media, the on-line/offline measurement divide will diminish. Television is one such medium that has traditionally required offline mea-surements. Advertisers are, for the most part, still accept-ing predictions and historical behaviors rather than current facts. Despite the limited accountability, yearly spendings on television advertisements are still much higher than for any other medium, and rising. In this paper, we present AdScorer, a scoring system for television advertisements. Our system is based on event stream processing techniques, and can compute scores for advertisements in near real-time based on channel change events from viewer set-top boxes. Our results show that AdScorer is capable of delivering detailed scores on a per-advertisement spot basis for a whole block of commercials, immediately after the commercial break has ended. The scores include <b>regional</b> <b>breakdowns</b> with viewer numbers and shares for each geographical region of Norway as well as na-tional scores.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of increasing female participation in the labour market on the transition to first childbirth. Regional perspectives are considered {{to help us understand}} how postponement behaviour is changing over time and at different paces in each region. The analysis is based on the first wave of the Generations and Gender Survey of Italy and Hungary. We use a multilevel event history random intercept model to examine {{the effect of}} individuals’ positions in the labour market on the transition to motherhood, controlling for differences in macrolevel factors related to regional backgrounds in the two countries. The regional data for Italy came from the Italian National Statistical Institute, and for Hungary from our imputation developed from the time series available at the national and the regional levels (Hungarian Central Statistical Office, KSH). The postponement of first childbirth is strongly linked to the increasing involvement of women in paid work, but with opposite effects in the two countries. Even if we control for changes in women’s levels of education over time and for shifts in women’s aspirations and levels of attainment in the labour market, we find that being employed remains a risk factor for the postponement of the first birth among Italian women, and a strong protective factor among Hungarian women. At the contextual level, the variables that take into account the regional socio-economic changes provides evidence of important effects on individual behaviour among Italian women, and of only minor effects among Hungarian women. All of the <b>regional</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in both Italy and Hungary show that the postponement of motherhood goes hand-in-hand with the acceptance of deep cultural and socio-economic changes...|$|R

40|$|A person's {{income is}} {{generally}} explained {{as a function}} of human capital variables and variables that measure the strength or structure of the economy. Income is usually studied as a variable dependent on education, union involvement, the income of others, and experience. <b>Regional</b> <b>breakdowns</b> of income in the United States, however, show significant variations in regional wages that may not be accounted for in traditional wage equations. This paper explores the determinants of income {{in each of the four}} U. S. Census regions to determine if significant differences exist and to account for the structural and regional causes of such differences. The results could have significant ramifications for policy makers and businessmen. This paper creates a regional income model to be evaluated using both OLS and neural networks. Results from OLS and the Cotton-Neumark decomposition method are compared with those of neural network to evaluate the advantages in methodology. Clearly, some of the variations in regional wages are due to differences in the variables making up the wage equations. Other variations, or residual differences, can be summed up as the regional coefficient that explains regional peculiarities in wage determination. To improve and extend the analysis, the data are also evaluated by a forward-feeding back-propagating neural network. Neural networks offer a significant advantage through their ability to determine the relationship between variables using only input and output data. Non-linear relationships can be modeled with neural networks, accounting for variation in behavior that could not accurately be modeled linearly. The networks will be run in two modes: prediction and classification. In the prediction mode, the neural network is directly analogous to the traditional economic model using OLS. As with the OLS regression, the network is run both with and without the regional dummy variables to measure the influence of a county's location. The neural network results are compared to OLS through R values between the predicted and actual values. Correlation values for various neural networks are in the range of. 90 to. 95, with exceptional income prediction in low and middle income counties. In the classification mode, the network interprets the county data, including income, and assigns each county to one of the four census regions. How accurately the network assigns counties their known regions illuminates the regional differences. Success is measured through several means. ...|$|R

50|$|The Club of Rome raised {{considerable}} {{public attention}} with its report Limits to Growth, which has sold 30 {{million copies in}} more than 30 translations, making it the best-selling environmental book in world history. Published in 1972 and presented {{for the first time}} at the International Students' Committee (ISC) annual Management Symposium in St. Gallen, Switzerland, it predicted that economic growth could not continue indefinitely because of the limited availability of natural resources, particularly oil. The 1973 oil crisis increased public concern about this problem. However, even before Limits to Growth was published, Eduard Pestel and Mihajlo Mesarovic of Case Western Reserve University had begun work on a far more elaborate model (it distinguished ten world regions and involved 200,000 equations compared with 1000 in the Meadows model). The research had the full support of the Club and the final publication, Mankind at the Turning Point was accepted as the official Second Report to the Club of Rome in 1974. In addition to providing a more refined <b>regional</b> <b>breakdown,</b> Pestel and Mesarovic had succeeded in integrating social as well as technical data. The Second Report revised the scenarios of the original Limits to Growth and gave a more optimistic prognosis for the future of the environment, noting that many of the factors were within human control and therefore that environmental and economic catastrophe were preventable or avoidable, hence the title.|$|E

This was further fuelled by the public discussion in Ukraine of whether the Russian language should be given official status and be made the second state language. During the 2009 gas conflict the Russian media almost uniformly portrayed Ukraine as an aggressive and greedy state that wanted to ally with Russia’s enemies and exploit cheap Russian gas.|$|E
