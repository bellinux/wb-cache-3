Furthermore, comparisons of the temperature dependent model to using the room temperature model at elevated temperatures is given and significant differences are observed when using temperatures above 100 °C.

But their work has been further extended to the cases of massive uncharged and charged particles' tunneling recently.

40|$|The {{observed}} {{resonance peak}} around 2. 86  GeV has been carefully reexamined by the LHCb Collaboration {{and it is}} found that under the peak there reside two states, Ds 1 ∗(2860) and Ds 3 ∗(2860), which are considered as 13 D 1 (cs¯) and 13 D 3 (cs¯) with slightly different masses and total widths. Thus, the earlier assumption that the resonance Ds 1 ∗(2710) was a 1 D state should be reconsidered. We suggest to measure the partial widths of radiative decays of Ds 1 ∗(2860), Ds 3 ∗(2860), and Ds 1 ∗(2710) to confirm their quantum numbers.

First, the fault of rolling bearing vibration signal will be decomposed into several IMF components, {{in view of the}} illusive component may appear in EEDM components, <b>respectively</b> <b>calculate</b> each IMF components and the correlation between the original signal, then carry out spectrum analysis to each IMF components and pick up fault feature.

Preface In rotating machinery, rolling bearing is not only the most widely used in mechanical parts, but also one of the easiest damaged components. Many bearings still can work reliably beyond the design life, but some bearings under normal condition come to accuracy decline or breakdown when has yet to reach the design life, which lead to the equipment in abnormal and even causing catastrophic consequences. So the state detection and fault diagnosis of bearing has important practical significance. In various diagnosis methods of rolling bearing, diagnosis technology based on vibration signa...|$|E
40|$|What is {{the real}} role of the quantum {{coherence}} and entanglement in the radical pair (RP) compass, and what determines the singlet yield have not been fully understood. In this paper, {{we find that the}} dark states of the two-electron Zeeman energy operator (TEZE) {{play an important role in}} the RP compass. We <b>respectively</b> <b>calculate</b> the singlet yields for two initial states in this dark state basis: the coherent state and the same state just removing the dark state coherence. For the later there is neither dark state coherence nor entanglement in the whole dynamical process. Surprisingly we find that in both cases the singlet yields are the same, and based on this result, we believe that the dark state population determines the singlet yield completely, and the dark state coherence and entanglement have little contribution to it. Finally, we also find that the dark state population as well as the singlet yield anisotropy is fragile to the vertical magnetic noise. However, the orientation is robust and is even enhanced by the parallel magnetic noise because the dark states expand a decoherence-free subspace. The dark state population as well as the orientation is more robust to the hyperfine coupling noise. Comment: 12 page...|$|E
40|$|A {{working group}} {{established}} {{in the framework of}} the EUPHRESCO European collaborative project aimed to compare and validate diagnostic protocols for the detection of "Flavescence dorée" (FD) phytoplasma in grapevines. Seven molecular protocols were compared in an interlaboratory test performance study where each laboratory had to analyze the same panel of samples consisting of DNA extracts prepared by the organizing laboratory. The tested molecular methods consisted of universal and group-specific real-time and end-point nested PCR tests. Different statistical approaches were applied to this collaborative study. Firstly, there was the standard statistical approach consisting in analyzing samples which are known to be positive and samples which are known to be negative and reporting the proportion of false-positive and false-negative results to <b>respectively</b> <b>calculate</b> diagnostic specificity and sensitivity. This approach was supplemented by the calculation of repeatability and reproducibility for qualitative methods based on the notions of accordance and concordance. Other new approaches were also implemented, based, on the one hand, on the probability of detection model, and, on the other hand, on Bayes' theorem. These various statistical approaches are complementary and give consistent results. Their combination, and in particular, the introduction of new statistical approaches give overall information on the performance and limitations of the different methods, and are particularly useful for selecting the most appropriate detection scheme with regards to the prevalence of the pathogen. Three real-time PCR protocols (methods M 4, M 5 and M 6 respectively developed by Hren (2007), Pelletier (2009) and under patent oligonucleotides) achieved the highest levels of performance for FD phytoplasma detection. This paper also addresses the issue of indeterminate results and the identification of outlier results. The statistical tools presented in this paper and their combination can be applied to many other studies concerning plant pathogens and other disciplines that use qualitative detection methods...|$|E

30|$|Objective {{function}} (1) {{seeks to}} minimize costs including multimodal transportation costs and location-routing costs. First and second sentences are about location-routing costs which calculate cost of routing from DCs to retailers and DCs establishment fixed cost, respectively. Third and fourth sentences, <b>respectively,</b> <b>calculate</b> cost of transportation from supplier to DC on multimodal network, {{and cost of}} providing mode changing facilities as multimodal transportation costs. Constraint set (2) defines flow conservation on multimodal network and states that product flow inters to a node should be to equal product flow exits it. Mode changing can be happened only on multimodal terminals (nodes {{that more than one}} mode inters or exits the node). For each transportation mode, if products inter to a multimodal network and leave it with the same mode, mode changing will not happen and the corresponding variable (y_v) will be zero. Same logic uses for changing modes. Constraint set (3) illustrate this for each node v ∈ V_two. As accounted for by constraint set (4), sum of products arriving at a DC should be equal to total demands raised by the assigned retailers to that DC. Based on the constraint set (5), each retailer is assigned to exactly one DC. Constraint set (6) ensures that no product can be dispatched to a non-established DC and if DC establishment variable (z_j) takes zero, all the product flows ending to that DC take zero as well. Constraint set (7) assigns each retailer to exactly one vehicle, while the constraint set (8) limits the capacity of the vehicles and ensures that summation of assigned customers demand does not pass vehicle capacity. In each product delivery tour on road network, every vehicle once entered a node will definitely exit that node and constraint set (9) guarantees that. Constraint set (10) is to ensure that each and every vehicle is allocated to at most one DC. The absence of common links between DCs is promised by constraint set (11). The constraint set (12) assures that a retailer is assigned to a DC if and only if there is a route from the DC to that retailer. Constraint sets (13) and (14) state that vehicles can be dispatched only from established DCs. Constraint set (15) relates to sub-tour elimination, and constraints (16), (17), and (18) define variables. The last three constraints determine model variables signs.|$|E
