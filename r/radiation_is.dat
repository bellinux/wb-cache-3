5|$|Although we {{are used}} to {{thinking}} of supernovae primarily as luminous visible events, the electromagnetic radiation they release is almost a minor side-effect. Particularly in the case of core collapse supernovae, the emitted electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> {{a tiny fraction of the}} total energy released during the event.|$|E

25|$|Electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} {{source of energy}} used for spectroscopic studies. Techniques that employ {{electromagnetic}} <b>radiation</b> <b>are</b> typically classified by the wavelength region of the spectrum and include microwave, terahertz, infrared, near infrared, visible and ultraviolet, x-ray and gamma spectroscopy.|$|R
5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> known as {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when {{the universe}} was only 10–17 million years old.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst {{predicted}} that microwave radiation with wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas; and in 1951 it was observed. This <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> {{not affected by}} dust absorption, and so its Doppler shift {{can be used to}} map the motion of the gas in our galaxy. These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in the center of our galaxy. With improved radio telescopes, hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies.|$|E
5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback loop in the Earth's climate system. The more snow and ice, the more solar <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other studies found that pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Walther Bothe and Herbert Becker in Giessen, Germany {{found that}} if the {{energetic}} alpha particles emitted from polonium fell on certain light elements, specifically beryllium, boron, or lithium, an unusually penetrating <b>radiation</b> <b>was</b> produced. Since this <b>radiation</b> <b>was</b> not influenced by an electric field (neutrons have no charge), it was thought to <b>be</b> gamma <b>radiation.</b> The <b>radiation</b> <b>was</b> more penetrating than any gamma rays known, and the details of experimental results were difficult to interpret.|$|R

Indium tin oxide {{is used as a}} light filter in low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps. The infrared <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> reflected back into the lamp, which increases the temperature within the tube and improves the performance of the lamp.|$|E
5|$|Intraoperative {{radiation}} therapy (IORT) delivers radiation {{at the same}} time as the surgery to remove the tumour (lumpectomy). An applicator is placed in the cavity left after tumour removal and a mobile electronic device generates radiation (either x-rays or electrons) and delivers it via the applicator. <b>Radiation</b> <b>is</b> delivered all at once and the applicator removed before closing the incision.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} for a particle to travel through a medium faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium (but still slower than c). When a charged particle does that in a dielectric material, the electromagnetic equivalent of a shock wave, known as Cherenkov <b>radiation,</b> <b>is</b> emitted.|$|E
50|$|Transition <b>radiation</b> <b>was</b> {{demonstrated}} theoretically by Ginzburg and Frank in 1945. They {{showed the}} existence of Transition radiation when a charged particle perpendicularly passed through a boundary between two different homogeneous media. The frequency of radiation emitted in the backwards direction relative to the particle was mainly {{in the range of}} visible light. The intensity of <b>radiation</b> <b>was</b> logarithmically proportional to the Lorentz factor of the particle. This provided a new way of measuring the Lorentz factor of the relativistic particles. But the energy of <b>radiation</b> <b>was</b> very small, which made it difficult to measure.|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric <b>radiation</b> <b>was</b> {{measured}} {{as a function}} of wavelength, position, angle, and time. <b>Radiation</b> <b>was</b> determined by temperature, cloud (aerosol), composition, and surface emissivity measurements.

5|$|Pulsars are {{rotating}} {{neutron stars}} {{that have a}} magnetic field. A narrow beam of electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> emitted from the poles of rotating pulsars. If the beam sweeps past {{the direction of the}} Solar System then the pulsar will produce a periodic pulse that can be detected from the Earth. The energy radiated by the magnetic field gradually slows down the rotation rate, so that older pulsars can require as long as several seconds between each pulse.|$|E
5|$|The film also rescues {{a central}} concept in the comics, {{the fact that}} <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> one {{of the causes of}} genetic {{mutation}} in the X-Men fictional universe, and incorporates it in the storyline, resurrecting the concept which went unused in the last years, as writers in the comics more recently have attributed the phenomenon of mutation mostly to evolution and natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Thorium tetrafluoride {{is used as}} an antireflection {{material}} in multilayered optical coatings. It has an optical transparency {{in the range of}} 0.35–12µm, and its <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> primarily due to alpha particles, which can be easily stopped by a thin cover layer of another material. Replacements for thorium tetrafluoride are being developed as of the 2010s.|$|E

5|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, {{reducing the amount of}} water available to form noctilucent clouds. The <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> known to vary cyclically with the solar cycle and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of infrared wavelengths close to visible light, such <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space. Some molecules radiate strongly in the infrared. This allows {{the study of the}} chemistry of space; more specifically it can detect water in comets.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{astronomy}} uses X-ray wavelengths. Typically, X-ray <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> {{produced by}} synchrotron emission (the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines), thermal emission from thin gases above 107 (10million) kelvins, and thermal emission from thick gases above 107 Kelvin. Since X-rays are {{absorbed by the}} Earth's atmosphere, all X-ray observations must be performed from high-altitude balloons, rockets, or X-ray astronomy satellites. Notable X-ray sources include X-ray binaries, pulsars, supernova remnants, elliptical galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and active galactic nuclei.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the amount}} of {{radiation}} emerging from {{the opposite side of}} the material can be detected and measured, variations in this amount (or intensity) of <b>radiation</b> <b>are</b> used to determine thickness or composition of material.

5|$|A few {{physicists}} {{persisted in}} developing semiclassical models in which electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> not quantized, but matter appears {{to obey the}} laws of quantum mechanics. Although the evidence from chemical and physical experiments {{for the existence of}} photons was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as absolutely definitive; since it relied on the interaction of light with matter, and a sufficiently complete theory of matter could in principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, all semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments. Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that quantization is a property of light itself is considered to be proven.|$|E
5|$|About twenty {{isotopes}} and six {{nuclear isomers}} (excited states of an isotope) of berkelium have been characterized with the mass numbers ranging from 235 to 254. All {{of them are}} radioactive. The longest half-lives are observed for 247Bk (1,380years), 248Bk (over300years) and 249Bk (330days); the half-lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The isotope which is the easiest to synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft β-particles which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> rather weak – 1.45% {{with respect to the}} β-radiation – but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because the water is to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring the water up to standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the <b>radiation</b> <b>is</b> present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E
