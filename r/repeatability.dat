40|$|Abstract. Geodetic {{measurements}} with Rogue Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers from {{sites in}} the California Permanent GPS Geodetic Array (PGGA) have been analyzed using the GIPSY orbit-determination and baseline-estimation software. Based on an unbiased selection of 23 daily measurements spanning 8 months, the low-frequency (•> weeks) contributions to the long-term <b>repeatabilities</b> of baseline measurements are approximately 5, 3, and 8 mm for the east, north, and vertical components. Short-term contributions to the long-term <b>repeatabilities</b> were evaluated by examining data from the week of October 21, 1990, which showed the lowest short-term scatter. For this week, daily <b>repeatabilities</b> of 2 - 3 mm in the horizontal and 4 mm in the vertical have been achieved for the 172 -kin JPL-Pinyon baseline, consistent with carrier phase data noise of ~ 6 min. High quality (% 5 mm) <b>repeatabilities</b> have been achieved for all components of the other baselines as well...|$|R

40|$|When {{interpreting}} {{responses to}} experimental manipulations or particular environmental cues, {{it is necessary}} to have previous knowledge about the natural variation of the response traits. We studied how nine blood parameters, including four enzymatic activities, varied with time in wild Great Tits by assessing their <b>repeatabilities</b> over periods of 45 days, in the same season (Spring or Autumn/Winter), in the same year and over a four years period. The accuracy of the measurements of these blood parameters was also assessed. Measurement error reflected essentially sample and time of storage rather than assay effects. Hematocrit and haemoglobin had low <b>repeatabilities</b> within Spring, ranging from 0. 26 to 0. 31; Heterophil/Lymphocyte ratio (H/L), white blood cell count (WBC), total plasma cholinesterase and red blood cell glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities had moderate to high <b>repeatabilities</b> over periods of 45 days (<b>repeatabilities</b> ranged from 0. 47 to 0. 81 for GSH-Px and H/L, respectively), but also during longer periods such as dur- ing Spring (total plasma cholinesterase activity) and Autumn/Winter (WBC, H/L and GSH-Px). Of the blood parameters measured, total plasma cholinesterase, glutathione peroxidase and the haematological parameters WBC and H/L seem relatively constant and therefore reliable indicators of Great Tit's physiological condition within, at least, a 45 days time fram...|$|R
40|$|Heritabilities and <b>repeatabilities</b> are {{presented}} for various behavioural attributes affecting foraging performance and fitness in Aquarius (Gerris) remigis (Heteroptera: Gerridae) females. These behavioural attributes were patch choice, foraging success, capture accuracy, {{and measures of}} mobility, activity, skittishness and aggressiveness. Most heritabilities {{were not significantly different}} from zero, which {{may be related to the}} low sampIe size. Conclusions as to the potential of direct selection on behaviour in this species were consequently limited. In contrast, with a few exceptions (capture accuracy, foraging success), most <b>repeatabilities</b> were significant and at times high (range=O' 22 -O' 79), indicating consistent, stereotypical individual behaviour. Tbe Iife history or reproductive state of the daughter generation individuals signifieantly affected the magnitude of the <b>repeatabilities</b> as weil as the mean values of many of the variables (notably mobility and aggressiveness), the latter in a manner consistent with field observations. This indicates that the state of the organism affects the general environmental variance, thus contributing to the discrepancies between the <b>repeatabilities</b> and the heritabilities obtained. It is suggested that common physiological proeesses (e. g. hormones) may underlie several of the behavioural attributes examined, resulting in possible pleiotropie effects and eonstraints on selection in a heterogeneous environment. It is further suggested that field studies of selection on behavioural attributes may be a more fruitful approach in this species, whose suitability for genetic analysis is limited...|$|R

30|$|It {{is known}} that errors in tropospheric {{parameters}} propagate to the estimates of station coordinates (Nilsson et al. 2013).

Widely used measures to quantify the effects on station positions are station coordinate and baseline length <b>repeatabilities</b> (Davis et al. 1985). Nilsson et al. (2015) showed that by using a Kalman filter instead of least squares adjustment, an improvement in the baseline length <b>repeatabilities</b> of about 10 % is possible.

25|$|<b>Repeatability</b> in an {{industrial}} process is also subject {{to the accuracy of}} the end effector, for example a gripper, and even to the design of the 'fingers' that match the gripper to the object being grasped. For example, if a robot picks a screw by its head, the screw could be at a random angle. A subsequent attempt to insert the screw into a hole could easily fail. These and similar scenarios can be improved with 'lead-ins' e.g. by making the entrance to the hole tapered.|$|E
25|$|Some {{increases}} in complexity are sometimes necessary. So {{there remains a}} justified general bias toward the simpler of two competing explanations. To understand why, consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always {{an infinite number of}} possible, more complex, and ultimately incorrect, alternatives. This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an ad hoc hypothesis. Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified. Even other empirical criteria, such as consilience, can never truly eliminate such explanations as competition. Each true explanation, then, may have had many alternatives that were simpler and false, but also an infinite number of alternatives that were more complex and false. But if an alternative ad hoc hypothesis were indeed justifiable, its implicit conclusions would be empirically verifiable. On a commonly accepted <b>repeatability</b> principle, these alternative theories have never been observed and continue to escape observation. In addition, one does not say an explanation is true if it has not withstood this principle.|$|E

The gimbal was controlled by a computer, allowing Dalton to precisely set speed and movement; this ensured precise <b>repeatability</b> for multiple takes.|$|E

30|$|PFR values {{estimated}} from a given set {{of images}} may {{vary depending on}} observer-dependent demarcation of the LV contour. In the present study, better inter- and intraobserver <b>repeatabilities</b> in PFR measurement were demonstrated for the PC methods compared with the SSFP method. The SSFP method produced larger random errors in intraobserver comparison and larger systematic and random errors in interobserver comparison compared with the PC methods. The area of the demarcated LV region directly affects the estimation of PFR from SSFP images. By contrast, PFR measurement from PC images utilizes the total signal in the demarcated region and is less susceptible to observer-dependent contour demarcation than measurement from SSFP images due to low signal intensity near the contour. The excellent inter- and intraobserver <b>repeatabilities</b> support the clinical usefulness of PFR measurement by PC imaging.|$|R

2500|$|Accuracy and <b>repeatability</b> are {{different}} measures. <b>Repeatability</b> {{is usually the}} most important criterion for a robot and {{is similar to the}} concept of 'precision' in measurement—see accuracy and precision. ISO 9283 [...] sets out a method whereby both accuracy and <b>repeatability</b> can be measured. Typically a robot is sent to a taught position a number of times and the error is measured at each return to the position after visiting 4 other positions. <b>Repeatability</b> is then quantified using the standard deviation of those samples in all three dimensions. A typical robot can, of course make a positional error exceeding that and that could be a problem for the process. Moreover, the <b>repeatability</b> is different {{in different parts of the}} working envelope and also changes with speed and payload. ISO 9283 specifies that accuracy and <b>repeatability</b> should be measured at maximum speed and at maximum payload.
