50|$|With the Mexican government’s {{intent to}} control {{migration}} flows and attract foreigners who {{can contribute to}} economic development, the new migration law simplifies foreigners’ entrance and residence requirements. It replaces the two large immigration categories—immigrant and nonimmigrant—with the categories of “visitor” and “temporary resident”, while keeping the status of “permanent resident”. In the General Law of Population the two categories incorporate over 30 different types of foreigners—i.e. distinguished visitor, religious minister, etc.—each with its own stipulations and requirements to qualify for entry and stay. Under the new law the requirements are simplified, basically differentiating those foreigners who are allowed to work {{and those who are}} not. The law also expedites the permanent <b>resident</b> <b>application</b> process for retirees and other foreigners. For granting permanent residency, the law proposes using a point system based on factors such as level of education, employment experience, and scientific and technological knowledge.|$|E
50|$|With the Mexican government’s {{intent to}} control {{migration}} flows and attract foreigners who {{can contribute to}} economic development, the new migration law simplifies foreigners’ entrance and residence requirements. First, it replaces the two large immigration categories (immigrant and non-immigrant) with the categories of “visitor” and “temporary resident". The status of “permanent resident” is maintained. In the General Law of Population the two categories incorporate over 30 different types of foreigners—i.e. distinguished visitor, religious minister, etc.—each with its own stipulations and requirements to qualify for entry and stay. Under the new law the requirements are simplified, basically differentiating those foreigners who are allowed to work {{and those who are}} not. The law also expedites the permanent <b>resident</b> <b>application</b> process for retirees and other foreigners. For granting permanent residency, the law proposes using a point system based on factors such as level of education, employment experience, and scientific and technological knowledge. The specifics for the points system were established in the Law's regulations—Articles 124 to 127 of the Regulations—published on September 28, 2012. According to Article 81 of the Law and Article 70 of the regulations to the law, immigration officials are the only ones that can conduct immigration procedures although the Federal Police may assist but only under the request and guidance of the Institute of Migration. Verification procedures cannot be conducted in migrant shelters run by civil society organizations or by individuals that engage in providing humanitarian assistance to immigrants.|$|E

The current {{resident}} {{selection process}} for ophthalmology has undergone little {{change over the}} last several years and remains highly dependent on the traditional selection factors (i. e., grades, honors, letters of recommendation, and an interview). Unfortunately, these selection factors have not been shown to be consistently predictive of future resident performance. In addition, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has mandated implementation of six new competencies in resident training in the USA and the current selection process does not directly recruit for these competencies. We propose an implementation strategy to re-engineer and improve the resident selection process in ophthalmology and potentially develop assessments that would be predictive of actual downstream resident performance that would encompass the ACGME related competencies. An intradepartmental Task Force for the ACGME Competencies reviewed a PubMed literature search regarding resident selection.

40|$|Existing {{standard}} protocols for {{the web and}} Internet telephony fail {{to deliver}} real-time interactive communication from within a web browser. In particular, the client-server web protocol over reliable TCP is not always suitable for end-to-end low latency media path needed for interactive voice and video communication. To solve this, we compare the available platform options using the existing technologies such as modifying the web programming language and protocol, using an existing web browser plugin, and a separate host <b>resident</b> <b>application</b> that the web browser can talk to. We argue that using a separate application as an adaptor is a promising short term as well as long-term strategy for voice and video communications on the web. Our project aims at developing the open technology and sample implementations for web-based real-time voice and video communication applications. We describe the architecture of our project including (1) a RESTful web communication API over HTTP inspired by SIP message flows, (2) a web-friendly set of metadata for session description, and (3) an UDP-based end-to-end media path. All other telephony functions reside in the web application itself and/or in web feature servers. The adaptor approach allows us to easily add new voice and video codecs and NAT traversal technologies such as Host Identity Protocol. We want to make web-based communication accessible to millions of web developers, maximize the end user experience and security, and preserve the huge global investment in and experience from SIP systems while adhering to web standards and development tools as much as possible.

Adding real-time service and point-to-multipoint multicast routing to the Internet 's traditional point-to-point best effort service model will greatly increase the Internet's efficiency in handling point-to-multipoint real-time applications. Recently, the RSVP resource reservation protocol has introduced the concept of "reservation styles", which control how reservations are aggregated in multipoint-to-multipoint real-time applications. In this paper, which is an extension of [9], we analytically evaluate the efficiency gains offered by this new paradigm on three simple network topologies: linear, m-tree, and star. We compare the resource utilization of more traditional reservation approaches to the RSVP reservation styles in the asymptotic limit of large multipoint applications. We find that in several cases the efficiency improvements scale linearly in the number of hosts. 1 Introductio [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Main memory {{contains}} {{transient information}} for all <b>resident</b> <b>applications.</b> However, if memory chip contents survives power-off, e. g., via freezing DRAM chips, sensitive data such as passwords and keys can be extracted. Main memory persistence {{will soon be}} the norm as recent advancements in MRAM and FeRAM position non-volatile memory technologies for widespread deployment in laptop, desktop, and embedded system main memory. Unfortunately, the same properties that provide energy efficiency, tolerance against power failure, and “instant-on ” powerup also subject systems to offline memory scanning. In this paper, we propose a Memory Encryption Control Unit (MECU) that provides memory confidentiality during system suspend and across reboots. The MECU encrypts all memory transfers between the processor-local level 2 cache and main memory to ensure plaintext data is never written to the persistent medium. The MECU design is outlined and performance and security trade-offs considered. We evaluate a MECU-enhanced architecture using the SimpleScalar hardware simulation framework on several hardware benchmarks. This analysis shows the majority of memory accesses are delayed by less than 1 ns, with higher access latencies (caused by resume state reconstruction) subsiding within 0. 25 seconds of a system resume. In effect, the MECU provides zero-cost steady state memory confidentiality for non-volatile main memory. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{computing}} has a key {{requirement for}} resource configuration in a real-time manner. In such virtualized environ-ments, both virtual machines (VMs) and hosted applications {{need to be}} configured on-the-fly to adapt to system dynamics. The interplay between the layers of VMs and applications further complicates the problem of cloud configuration. Independent tuning of each aspect may not lead to optimal system wide performance. In this paper, we propose a framework, namely CoTuner, for coordinated configuration of VMs and <b>resident</b> <b>applications.</b> At {{the heart of the}} framework is a model-free hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) approach, which combines the advantages of Simplex and RL methods and is further enhanced by the use of system knowledge guided exploration policies. Experimental results on Xen-based virtualized environments with TPC-W and TPC-C benchmarks demonstrate that CoTuner is able to drive a virtual server system into an optimal or near-optimal configuration state dynamically, in response to the change of workload. It improves the systems throughput by more than 30 % over independent tuning strategies. In comparison with the coordinated tuning strategies based solely on Simplex or basic RL algorithm, the hybrid RL algorithm gains 30 % to 40 % throughput improvement. Moreover, the algorithm is able to reduce SLA violation of the applications by more than 80 %. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{describe}} {{an approach to}} protecting the privacy and security of user data on mobile devices using a richer semantic model of a user's context. Mobile OS frameworks like Android always lacked mechanisms for dynamic privacy control, while recent advances in context modeling, tracking and collaborative localization {{has led to the}} emergence of a new class of smartphone applications that can access and share embedded sensor data. Existing literature on context based privacy and security has predominantly focused on device user's context for probing privacy vulnerability and enforcing security at runtime. We bring into picture the most important component of privacy vulnerability on smartphones, the <b>resident</b> <b>applications</b> themselves and we introduce the novel idea of application provenance. Our context model is realized as a dynamic knowledge base of RDF [67] triples grounded in an ontology in the semantic web language OWL. Policies in the form of rules over this knowledge base monitor and control application access to sensitive information and sensor data. The policies filter data flowing from sensor resources to applications to reduce disclosure by generalizing or obfuscating data. Our ontology includes the ability to represent application provenance and other metadata that can be used by the policies. The resulting system provides fine-grained, context-dependent control to sensitive user data...|$|R
