40|$|This thesis {{presents}} new graptoloid biostratigraphic <b>range</b> <b>charts</b> for the Ordovician and Silurian of Britain. The Ordovician graptoloid succession {{is represented}} by two separate biostratigraphic frameworks; one for England and Wales, another for Scotland, due to significant stratigraphic disparity between the graptoloid faunal assemblages of the two regions. The British Silurian sequence {{is represented by}} a single graptoloid biostratigraphic scheme reflecting more uniform graptoloid assemblages.;The reliability of the taxonomic foundation upon which the <b>range</b> <b>charts</b> are based is tested using the dominant Ludlow Series (Silurian) graptoloid subfamily Saetograptinae Urbanek. The results suggest that intraspecific variation has led to over-elaborate taxonomic subdivision of this group at the species and subspecies level. The poor preservation {{of some of the}} type material has resulted in problems of misidentification and reinforces the need for a full taxonomic review of the saetograptids. Despite this, three basic theca/spine relationships can be recognised which may serve as a basis for future species identification: a chimaera-type morphology whereby thecal spines project form the middle of the apertural margin; a leintwardinensis-type structure, in which the spine extends from the free ventral wall of the proceeding theca; and a colonus-type relationship whereby {{the lower part of the}} apertural margin is prolonged into a hook-like lip.;Graptoloid biodiversity data extracted from the new <b>range</b> <b>charts</b> highlights several periods of biotic crisis during the Ordovician and Silurian of the UK. These 'events' correlate with globally recognised intervals of major graptoloid extinctions, which in turn correspond with large-scale palaeoenvironmental fluctuations, such as eustatic sea-level and climate change. Patterns of morphological change within UK graptoloids are also linked to these biodiversity trends and consequently, to environmental controls...|$|R

40|$|Ordovician deep-water shales {{contain the}} {{prerequisites}} for a high-resolution timescale: rich successions of graptolite faunas, datable ash-fall K-bentonites, and minimally interrupted accumulation. Traditionally, the first appearances of selected graptolite taxa define provincial sets of zones, into which radiometrically dated bentonites are subsequently arrayed {{to achieve a}} numerical timescale. Provincial differences and the modest numbers of zones impose the primary limits on resolution. We have taken a different approach that avoids the constraint of zones. ■ The New Approach To achieve a unifying timescale for this book, we applied computer-assisted optimization to combine graptolite <b>range</b> <b>charts</b> from all provinces directly, without using zones. The optimization process searches for a model sequence of all range-end events that best fits all the locally observed taxon ranges. Dated ashfall events are included with the range-end events from {{the outset of the}} search; thus, they too receive optimal placements in the model sequence and permit numerical ages for biostratigraphic events to be estimated by interpolation. By this method, we interpolated ages for the Australasian graptolite zone boundaries (VandenBerg and Cooper 1992). Ages for the boundaries in other subdivision schemes were derived, using all available criteria to correlate into the Australasian graptolite zonation (chapter 2). ■ The Raw Data The timescale is based on an ordered and scaled sequence of 2, 306 events: 22 dated bentonites that are associated with graptolites or other fossils for which contemporary graptolites are known (table 3. 1); 12 undated bentonite beds that help tie together short sections from the Mohawk Valley (C.

40|$|Statistical Process Control (SPC) is an {{important}} quality control technique, which aims to reduce variability and monitor {{the performance of a}} production process in order to improve and assure the quality of the' product. Control charting can be successfully applied for implementation of SPC in any industry.

The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the diversity of these corals through a taxonomical recognition of the species and morphotypes that occur in the Iberian Peninsula. Eighteen sections have been sampled between the Ossa-Morena (Mississippian) and Cantabrian (Pennsylvanian) zones dated as upper Viséan to early Kasimovian. In addition, other localities where auloporids occur and are cited in the literature have been also used for this study. The taxonomical identification has been carried out using the criteria proposed by Tchudinova (1980) with little modifications. Thus, eighteen morphotypes and two species belonging to nine nominal genera have been identified (Multithecopora sp. A-H, Syringopora sp. A-B, Aulopora sp. A-B, Cladochonus sp. A-B, Syringoalcyon sp., Roemeripora sp., Sinopora sp., Mastopora? sp., Multithecopora hontoriense and Neomultithecopora cantabrica).

40|$|In {{order to}} improve defect forecasts, I use Individuals and Moving Range charts (XmR). This {{is a type of}} control chart that is {{suitable}} for most real time situations, including the collection of periodic data such as defects detected in a given time period (such as week or month). The Individuals chart has each value plotted in time order. The Moving <b>Range</b> <b>chart,</b> on the other hand, plots the short-term variation from one period to the next. While most signals appear on the individuals chart, it is good practice to look at the moving <b>range</b> <b>chart</b> as well, as some signals will only show up on it. Control limits are based on the long-term average value as well as the average moving range value of one point to the next. It is important to calculate control limits correctly in order to not miss valid signals. The appropriate formulas can be found in select books [6, 7] and are also built into statistical tools such as SPSS, Minitab and SAS. Control limits provide a signal of sporadic or chronic problems. For tracking defects, however, the signal we are looking for is a change in the underlying quality of the software product. Hope-fully, this will be a signal of an improvement and not a signal of a problem! Rules There are a number of rules that are used to detect signals. The number of rules used and the definitions of the rules vary slightly from one source to another. However, the traditional use of control charts is best met by keeping the number of rules to a minimum, thereby reducing the chance of obtaining a false sig-nal. In this application, however, {{it is more important to}} err on the side of obtaining a false signal rather than missing a true signal. All uses of control charts walk this decision line. Shewhart origi-nally used 3 sigma limits because he wanted to minimize false signals, which would incur the unnecessary cost of researching a problem that didn’t exist. In other words, when he saw a signal he wanted to be almost completely certain it was real. In IBM SPSS 22, for example, there are 11 possible rules that can be turned on or off: • One point above + 3 Sigma, or one point below- 3 Sigma • 2 out of last 3 above + 2 Sigma, or 2 of 3 below- 2 Sigma • 4 out of last 5 above + 1 Sigma, or 4 out of...|$|E

One new ammonite faunal horizon has been identified in the Lower Bajocian: Bj- 10 b, Sonninia micracanthica (Buckman). This carries several of what have been regarded in the past as leading guide-fossils of the Sauzei Zone. But it is now seen to be also the type horizon of the index of the Laeviuscula Zone, Witchellia laeviuscula. It is therefore retained in the Laeviuscula Zone as its youngest horizon on grounds of nomenclatural stability.

40|$|A {{number of}} authors have {{indicated}} {{that it is not}} a good idea to use the moving <b>range</b> <b>chart</b> (MR-chart) with all individuals chart to detect shifts in the spread. However, the combination of these charts is still used in practice and even presented as 'best practice' in some cases. In addition, some more recent articles present arguments that justify the use of the additional MR-chart in specific situations. In this paper we investigate these arguments and add to the literature by providing two more reasons not to use the MR-chart. First, the merit of using ail MR-chart has never been evaluated before in the context of runs rules. Earlier papers investigated the change in performance as a result of adding a MR-chart to a bare individuals chart. We show that relative to existing well-known runs rules, there is no advantage in using a close alternative to the MR-chart. Secondly, we investigate the suggestion of some of the proponents of the MR-chart that its weak performance is due to a bad design. We show that this is not the case. We evaluate the average run length performance of the combination of all individuals chart and a MR-chart under the most favorable circumstances for several out-of-control situations by optimizing the design of the two charts for each situation. Our results show that even this 'best-case' performance of the combination is hardly better than that of the individuals chart alone. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
