40|$|In this study, {{mould growth}} on wood was {{investigated}} by image analysis. The studied parameters were drying and heat-treatment temperatures (20 - 210 °C), original and <b>resawn</b> surface and different wood species (spruce and larch). Small specimens—some {{of which were}} inoculated with a spore suspension—were stored under humid conditions and photographed once a week. Mould growth was assessed by image analysis. In general, results found in earlier studies regarding the influence of several parameters could be confirmed.

50|$|Gumming {{involves}} grinding the gullets of the {{saw teeth}} {{to a particular}} shape. The saw filer uses a semi or fully automatic grinding machine for this. Saw bands operate under high stress and heat and {{in the presence of}} wood chips. Carbon migrates into the steel from the wood. Gumming prevents case hardening and fatigue cracking of the saw band gullets. <b>Resaw</b> Bandsaws (teeth on one side only) may be left or right-handed, depending on which way the teeth are pointing and which way the plank falls from the log when cutting. Double cut saws (teeth on both sides) are always gummed right hand teeth first.|$|R
50|$|In 1807 Stephen married Catherine Phillips, who was {{entitled}} to a dowers share to {{a quarter of the}} traditional Johannes Phillips heasehold from the Van Rennselaer patroonship dating from the 1760s. The couple presumably settled in the original late 18th century three-bay brick house which appears in the same location on the Penfield rents map (1806). The house was built around 1810, the year in which Stephen gave his father in law a $10,000 mortgage. The house was constructed on an expanded footprint covering five bays and a small ell extending to the rear. Some of the structural materials used in building the federal home were salvaged from the earlier structure, including floor joists sawn from finished Dutch style ceiling beams, and floor boards <b>resawn</b> from old wide yellow pine flooring.|$|R
5000|$|A resaw {{is a large}} {{band saw}} {{optimized}} for cutting timber along the grain to reduce larger sections into smaller sections or veneers. <b>Resawing</b> veneers requires a wide blade - commonly 2 to 3 inches (52-78 mm) - with a small [...] to minimize waste. Resaw blades of up to 1 inch (26 mm) may be fitted to a standard band saw. Many small and medium-sized sawmills use 1- to -inch band saw blades.|$|E
50|$|The frame pit {{saw was the}} {{mainstay}} of <b>resawing</b> before stiff, unframed two-man saws called a muley or mulay saw, circular saws, and band saws took over. In some early sawmills a frame saw was powered from a water wheel, wind mill or other rotary motion through a crankshaft and connecting rod. Frame saws are now largely obsolete, though woodworkers who eschew power tools still make them for personal use in many sizes and styles of assembly.|$|E
5000|$|Upper and Lower Canada's major {{industry}} {{in terms of}} employment and value of the product was the timber trade. Bytown (later called Ottawa), was a major lumber and sawmill centre of Canada. When the Ottawa River first began {{to be used for}} floating timber en route to markets, squared timber was the preference. This required the logs to be skillfully shaped with broadaxes giving the whole log a squared appearance. It was wasteful but squared pine was preferred by the British for <b>resawing.</b> The timber was bound with other sticks into two related configurations, cribs, and rafts. (See the following section for a detailed explanation.) Squared timber [...] "became the main export" [...] and was easy to ship overseas and could be moved by [...] "pegged cribs". The rafts were floated on the Ottawa River to markets in Quebec.|$|E
50|$|Rip {{cuts are}} {{commonly}} {{made with a}} table saw, but other types of power saws can also be used, including a radial arm saw, band saw, and hand held circular saw. In sawmills the head saw is the first rip-saw a log goes through, which is sometimes a gang-saw, and then the cants may be <b>resawn</b> using other saws and then edged in a edger and sometimes cut to length by a crosscut saw. Also, smaller portable sawmills and chainsaw mills use rip-cuts to produce lumber. Each time {{a piece of wood}} is rip cut it takes time and the kerf material turns into sawdust and loses value so the number and width of each rip cut influence the economics of the operation: This gives band saws an advantage over circular saws and chainsaws.|$|R
5000|$|Tensioning is {{done with}} the stretcher-roll. This machine has {{hardened}} rollers {{above and below the}} saw. They rotate slowly (one is powered, while one runs free) and pinch the saw when a lever is cranked, rolling a thin strip through the length of the saw, stretching the metal where it was rolled. Careful placement and force of the rolls deform the metal in a way that counteracts the forces the saw sees during operation. More rolls are placed in the midsection of the saw. <b>Resaws</b> have the back pulled to counteract the uneven heating of the cutting edge. This is done by rolling the back (non cutting edge) of the saw. The back is measured with a three pin gauge, and is usually around [...]003" [...] per three feet curved.|$|R
40|$|The {{control over}} the {{products}} of the sawing of logs is important for the management of the sawmill and also to reduce environmental impacts. The yield and the time study are parameters for the assessment of unfolding in a sawmill. This study aimed to evaluate the yield and the time study of the sawing of Eucalyptus logs during the production of structural parts. This work used ten logs of Eucalyptus grandis from a plantation with 15 years of age, taken from an area of the Federal University of Lavras (UFLA). In the experimental sawmill of UFLA the logs were sawn using a band saw and the planks were <b>resawn</b> in a circular saw. The structural parts followed the dimensions laid down in the NBR 7190 (ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE NORMAS TÉCNICAS - ABNT, 1997). The parts produced were measured and calculated yield. The times of all stages of the process were obtained using a stopwatch and then analyzed the time actually sawing and the processing time of logs and planks. The average of yield for the production of main parts was 20. 9 % and secondary part was 22. 9 %. Average yield of sawing was satisfactory if compared with the values ​​obtained in other studies. The circular saw compared to band saw showed higher percentage of effective time sawing of wood. The effective time of sawing was less than half the total processing time of the logs...|$|R
40|$|In {{a typical}} sawmill, logs enter the mill {{and go through}} a de-barking process. Following this {{operation}} {{they go to the}} headrig where a sawyer moves the log repeatedly past a saw to remove boards one at a time. As more of the log interior is exposed with each board removed, the sawyer may re-orient the log periodically to cut from the best side. Sawn boards go through subsequent operations of edging and trimming, where defects near the edges and/or ends of the boards are removed to increase each board’s grade, and therefore its value. The cant (the cubical center section of the log) remaining from initial breakdown enters a <b>resawing</b> operation where additional boards are cut. These are also edged and trimmed...|$|E
40|$|Softwood logs are {{processed}} into green boards {{through a series}} of horizontal or vertical sawing operations that reduce lumber thickness. This paper uses physical understanding to model how systematic and random errors in board thickness accu-mulate during sequential <b>resawing.</b> The error model is validated on board thickness measurements gathered at a northern California sawmill. The analysis • explains previously puzzling patterns in the spatially averaged sample variances of board thickness measurements; • enables estimating, from measured board thicknesses, the means and variances of the thickness errors introduced by each sawing operation in the observed sequence; • generates stronger methods for sawmill quality control. Through submodeling of the mean vector and the covariance matrix of measured thicknesses, the paper finds slight “wedging ” in the mean thickness of certain boards and distance-based correlations among the random sawing errors on these boards. The one-way random effects model, used uncritically in earlier analyses of lumber thickness measurements, does not fit the study data...|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{experiences}} {{from industrial}} heattreatment of wood with the ThermoWood® processshow that {{more or less}} extensive internal crackingmay occur for thicker dimensions. This type of timberdamage is particularly troublesome because thesecracks do not reach the surface and are thus notvisible on unprocessed timber. After <b>resawing</b> orplaning the boards, cracks can appear, resulting incostly downgrading of the material. TheThermoWood® heat treatment process can bedivided into six periods. The first period, the heatingperiod, is when saturated steam is injected into thekiln, the second period is the drying step, which canbe either high or low temperature drying, the thirdperiod is when the final heating and drying takeplace, the fourth period is when the temperature iskept constant for about 2 – 4 hours, the fifth period isthe cooling regime, the sixth period is theconditioning regime for remoistening the material,and the last period is the cooling one. At the Divisionof Wood Physics at Luleå University of Technologyin Skellefteå a climate chamber has recently beeninstalled. This climate chamber together with a CTscannermakes it possible to study wood densitychanges in different climates.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{strength}} test of solid and glue laminated timbers represented by Kapur, Teak and Red Meranti {{are reported in}} this paper. The method used for the testing was the ASTM D 143 - 1970. For {{the purpose of the}} test, 8 x 12 x 400 cm lumbers of the three species were divided into two groups being de- signated respectively for test in solid and glue laminated form. The first group were tested for modulus of rupture, com- pression parallel to the grain and shear strength under air dry condition. In bending tests, two methods of loading were applied, namely perpendicular and parallel to the laminae in case of glue laminated timbers, and along radial or tangential direction for solid timbers. The second group were <b>resawn</b> further into 0. 9 cm and 1. 9 cm thick timber strips, respectioely, for small size tests of the glue laminated specimens. The 0. 9 cm thick strips which were air-dried and then glued with CIBA Phenol resorcinol-formal-dehyde adhesives, were designated for test on modulus of rupture and compression. The 1. 9 cm thick strips were divided further into five batches, and each of which were dried respectively until 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 percent moisture content before glueing with the above mentioned adhesive into six different combination of test pieces namely Teah-Meranti (JM), Teak-Kapur (JK), Meranti-Kapur (MK), Kapur-kapur (KK), Teak-Teak (JJ) and meranti-Meranti (MM).

40|$|Short paper talk at <b>RESAW</b> 2015 conference (Aarhus, Denmark). International audienceI {{would like}} to present work on texts corpora in German, {{gathered}} on the Web and processed {{in order to be}} made available to linguists and a broader user community via a web interface. The corpora are specialized {{in the sense that they}} only address a particular text genre or source at a time. Web crawling techniques are used to download the documents, then they are stored roughly in the way web archives do. More precisely, I {{would like to}} talk about two cases where texts are expected to be republishable: a "standard" case, political speeches, and a "borderline" case, German blogs under CC license. The work is performed in the context of a digital dictionary of German. The primary user base consists of lexicographers, who need valuable or at least exploitable evidence, in the form of precise quotes or definition elements. The actual gathering and processing of the corpora is described elsewhere (anonymized references). In this talk I would like to focus on a series of challenges that are to be solved in order to make data from web archives accessible to researchers and to study web text corpora: metadata extraction, quality assurance, licensing, and "scientificity". 1. A proper metadata extraction is needed in order to make further downstream applications possible. It has to be performed meticulously, since experience shows that even small or rare mistakes in date encoding for instance may cause the application to be disregarded or discarded by researchers in the humanities, since linguistic trends cannot be identified properly if the content is not ordered in time. Easily available metadata in the case of speeches constrast with different content types, encodings, and markup patterns concerning the blogs. Compromises have to be made without sacrificing recall, since republishable texts are rather rare. 2. Regarding the content, quality assurance is paramount, since a high quality is expected by users, all the more since they may feel reluctant to use web texts for their studies. In fact, providing "Hi-Fi" web corpora also means promoting the cause of web sources and modernization of research methodology. 3. The results are hosted in Germany, and thus German copyright laws apply, which can be considered to be more restrictive than others. Additionally, there are a number of issues with licensing in general and CC licenses in particular, even with manual verification: the CC ND and (to a lesser extent) NC predicates can hinder proper republication. There are also potential copyright issues regarding blog comments. To sum up the issues described above, much work flows into ensuring the "scientificity" of web texts and making the texts not only available but also citable in a scholarly sense...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Options for {{recycling}} and reusing chromated-copper-arsenate- (CCA) treated material include dimensional lumber and round wood size reduction, composites, and remediation. Size reduction by remilling, shaving, or <b>resawing</b> CCA-treated wood reduces {{the volume of}} landfilled waste material and provides many options for reusing used treated wood. Manufacturing composite products from CCA-treated wood combined with untreated wood, plastic, or cement has been explored. Remediation strategies are numerous; chemica l extraction, bioleaching, chelation, and liquefaction {{or a combination of}} these techniques has been successful at removing metals from treated wood to varying degrees. Bioremediation is a novel approach to recycling CCA-treated waste wood and provides an opportunity to reuse this abundant fiber source in value-added composite products. In this method, oxalic acid extraction and bioleaching with a metal-tolerant bacterium have successfully removed 70 % copper, 81 % arsenic, and 100 % chromium from chipped CCA-treated Southern Pine. The two-step sequence of acid extraction followed by bioleaching removed more metals than either acid extraction or bioleaching alone. Reversing the sequence and bioleaching prior to acid extraction was also not as effective at metal removal. Metals that are released from CCA-treated wood during biomediation are recoverable from a liquid medium and available for reuse or disposal. The “cleaned ” wood particles were reassembled into medium-density particleboard prepared with urea-formaldehyde resin and evaluated for physical properties, such as internal bond strength, modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture, thickness swell, and water absorption. Bioremediation removes 80 % to 100 % of the heavy metals from spent CCA-treated wood enabling the wood fiber to be reused in composite products. However, as long as CCA-treated wood can be disposed in landfills, economics will remain unfavorable for wide acceptance of alternative reuse and remediation options...|$|E
