5|$|Considering the {{response}} to be unsatisfactory, de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country. He wanted to give France, {{in the event of}} an East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger NATO–Warsaw Pact war. In February 1959, France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command, and later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil. This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and <b>return</b> <b>control</b> of the air force bases that it had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967.|$|E

The company accused Gray of using the spectrum auction and sale of the station to exit the agreements illegitimately, as they were to last through 2020, and apply to any future owner of WAGT. Gray attempted to block the injunction by arguing that its actions were {{required in order to}} comply with the FCC's prohibition of joint sales agreements, but was denied. Media General took back control of WAGT on March 7, 2016.|$|E

25|$|Factional {{fighting}} at {{the imperial}} court continued throughout the Nara period. Imperial family members, leading court families, {{such as the}} Fujiwara, and Buddhist priests all contended for influence. Earlier this period, Prince Nagaya seized power at the court {{after the death of}} Fujiwara no Fuhito. Fuhito was succeeded by four sons, Muchimaro, Umakai, Fusasaki, and Maro. They put Emperor Shōmu, the prince by Fuhito's daughter, on the throne. In 729, they arrested Nagaya and regained control. However, as the first outbreak of smallpox spread from Kyūshū in 735, all four brothers were killed two years later, resulting in temporary shrinking of Fujiwara's dominance. It is without doubt that the Emperor was heavily shocked about this disaster, and he moved the palace three times in only five years since 740, until he eventually returned to Nara. In the late Nara period, financial burdens on the state increased, and the court began dismissing nonessential officials. In 792 universal conscription was abandoned, and district heads were allowed to establish private militia forces for local police work. Decentralization of authority became the rule despite the reforms of the Nara period. Eventually, to <b>return</b> <b>control</b> to imperial hands, the capital was moved in 784 to Nagaoka-kyō and in 794 to Heian-kyō (literally Capital of Peace and Tranquility), about twenty-six kilometers north of Nara. By the late eleventh century, the city was popularly called Kyoto (capital city), the name it has had ever since.|$|E

2500|$|There were {{concerns}} about Diesel and Dust and Midnight Oil's attempts to express indigenous issues to white urban audiences - namely, the question [...] "who holds {{the power to}} tell whose history?" [...] The lyrics of [...] "The Dead Heart" [...] {{tell the story of}} colonisation from an indigenous point of view but some critics felt they reinforced the [...] "primitive" [...] stereotype. Use of the bullroarer was criticised as belonging to sacred rituals, and therefore not appropriate for rock songs. [...] "The Dead Heart" [...] had been written in response to a request by organisers of the 1985 ceremony to <b>return</b> <b>control</b> of Uluru to its indigenous caretakers; Midnight Oil originally resisted being added to a concert bill that they believed should contain indigenous groups, but the organisers insisted, arguing that the band would reach a wider audience within the predominantly Caucasian urban centres. Midnight Oil requested that all royalties from the song go to indigenous communities. In addition, two indigenous groups, Warumpi Band and Gondwanaland, toured with them.|$|E

2500|$|Soon after Emperor Xizong's {{return to}} Chang'an, however, a serious dispute {{developed}} between Tian Lingzi, {{who was still}} largely {{in control of the}} imperial court, and Wang Chongrong, then the military governor of Huguo Circuit (護國, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). The dispute stemmed from the desperate financial situation that the imperial government was in by this point—with only Chang'an and the immediately surrounding region under the imperial government's control and submitting taxes to it (and the other circuits withholding their usual tax submissions to the imperial government, the imperial government was unable to pay the salaries of the army that Tian had amassed, which included the Shence Armies and personal armies that Tian himself had recruited). Tian tried to partially solve the problem by ordering Wang to <b>return</b> <b>control</b> of salt ponds at Huguo Circuit, previously under imperial control, to the imperial government, so that its proceeds could be used to pay imperial armies. [...] Wang refused and spoke against Tian publicly. [...] Tian, in retaliation, had Emperor Xizong order that Wang be transferred to Tianping Circuit. Wang refused the transfer and, allied with Li Keyong, prepared for a confrontation with the imperial armies under Tian, as well as Tian's allies Zhu Mei the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (靜難, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and Li Changfu the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shanxi). Around new year 886, they defeated Tian and his allies and approached Chang'an. [...] Tian took Emperor Xizong and fled to Xingyuan (興元, in modern Hanzhong, Shanxi).|$|E
