5|$|A {{physician}} will initially assess for Parkinson's {{disease with}} a careful medical history and neurological examination. People {{may be given}} levodopa, with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping to confirm the PD diagnosis. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered final proof that the person had PD.

5|$|William Warburton's {{treatise}} The Divine Legation of Moses, published from 1738 to 1741, {{included an}} analysis of ancient mystery rites that drew upon Sethos for much of its evidence. Assuming that all mystery rites derived from Egypt, Warburton argued that {{the public face of}} Egyptian religion was polytheistic, but the Egyptian mysteries were designed to reveal a deeper, monotheistic truth to elite initiates. One of them, Moses, learned this truth during his Egyptian upbringing and developed Judaism to <b>reveal</b> <b>it</b> to the entire Israelite nation.|$|E

5|$|The show's {{original}} puzzle {{board had}} three rows of 13 manually operated trilons, {{for a total}} of 39 spaces. On December 21, 1981, a larger board with 48 trilons in four rows (11, 13, 13 and 11 trilons) was adopted. This board was surrounded by a double-arched border of lights which flashed {{at the beginning and end}} of the round. Each trilon had three sides: a green side to represent spaces not used by the puzzle, a blank side to indicate a letter that had not been revealed, and a side with a letter on it. While the viewer saw a seamless transition to the next puzzle, with these older boards in segments where more than one puzzle was present, a stop-down of taping took place during which the board was be wheeled offstage and the new puzzle loaded in by hand out of sight of the contestants. On February 24, 1997, the show introduced a computerized puzzle board composed of 52 touch-activated monitors in four rows (12 on the top and bottom rows, 14 in the middle two). To illuminate a letter during regular gameplay, the hostess touches the right edge of the monitor to <b>reveal</b> <b>it.</b> The computerized board obviated the stop-downs, allowing tapings to finish quicker at a lower cost to the production company.|$|E

25|$|Petite Arvine B, {{originated}} in the Valais in Switzerland. Historical documents <b>reveal</b> <b>it</b> has been grown since the early 17th century, around 1602.

25|$|As an example, the Spanish were {{received}} peaceably in Tzintzuntzan by Tangáxuan II, the cazonci of the Tarascan state, which largely {{coincides with the}} modern state of Michoacán. Tangáxuan gave Guzmán presents of gold and silver and supplied him with soldiers and provisions. Nevertheless, Guzmán had him arrested and tortured, {{to get him to}} reveal the location of hidden stores of gold. Presumably there was no more gold, because Tangáxuan did not <b>reveal</b> <b>it</b> under torture. Guzmán had him dragged by a horse and then burned alive on February 14, 1530.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there were}} a number of {{objections}} to these proposals, amongst them from Strathclyde Bus Holdings, who it could be argued did so out of fear of their profit margins being affected by such an initiative. This necessitated a public inquiry, which lasted around 10 weeks. The Parliamentary Commissioners appointed to deliberate on the matter met and discussed the conclusions of this inquiry in a matter of hours before finding in favour of the objections raised thus killing off the Strathclyde Tram Project. The reasoning of the Commissioners is unknown as there existed no obligation for them to <b>reveal</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1959, Hussein {{embarked}} on a tour to different countries to consolidate bilateral ties. His visit to the United States gained him many friends in Congress after he spoke openly against Soviet influence in the Middle East, returning with a $50million aid package. Sadiq Al-Shar'a, an army general who accompanied Hussein to the United States, {{was found to have}} been plotting a coup against the monarchy. News of the arrest of the conspiring officers in Jordan coincided with Hussein's visit to the US. Hussein was tipped off to Al-Shar'a's involvement, but did not <b>reveal</b> <b>it</b> until they both landed back in Jordan. Al-Shar'a was tried and received the death penalty; Hussein reduced his sentence to life imprisonment. Four years later, Al-Shar'a was pardoned and appointed director of Jordan's passport office.|$|E
25|$|Later, Tartaglia {{was persuaded}} by Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576) {{to reveal his}} secret for solving cubic equations. In 1539, Tartaglia did so only on the {{condition}} that Cardano would never <b>reveal</b> <b>it</b> and that if he did write a book about cubics, he would give Tartaglia time to publish. Some years later, Cardano learned about Ferro's prior work and published Ferro's method in his book Ars Magna in 1545, meaning Cardano gave Tartaglia six years to publish his results (with credit given to Tartaglia for an independent solution). Cardano's promise with Tartaglia stated that he not publish Tartaglia's work, and Cardano felt he was publishing del Ferro's, so as to get around the promise. Nevertheless, this led to a challenge to Cardano by Tartaglia, which Cardano denied. The challenge was eventually accepted by Cardano's student Lodovico Ferrari (1522–1565). Ferrari did better than Tartaglia in the competition, and Tartaglia lost both his prestige and income.|$|E

He treats the noblemen in the {{hierarchy}} as he would the common people, and his vassals cannot accept this. They rise against King Ban, destroying the kingdom and killing everyone in the castle. They nonetheless allow Elaine, King Ban's wife, to live as she is known for her kindness. She escapes, while {{the queen of the}} sea-fairies, takes Lanzelet away to raise him on an island inhabited by women. There, he learns how to use weapons just as well as he learns music and song. Lanzelet yearns to know his own name but the fairy refuses to <b>reveal</b> <b>it</b> to him until he has defeated her worst enemy, Iweret.
