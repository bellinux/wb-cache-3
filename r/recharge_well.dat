40|$|Artificial {{recharge}} and rainwater harvesting {{methods are}} being applied for mitigating effects of groundwater depletions in severe over-drafting {{urban and rural}} situations. When the aquifer to be recharged is situated at some depth below the ground surface and topped by a semi-previous layer with a large resistance against vertical water movement, recharge wells are the most appropriate solution. Water is injected by free or forced recharge technique by maintaining constant or variable head or rate of injection in the <b>recharge</b> <b>well.</b> A review of literature, carried out in two parts, looks into the aspects and performance of the practical field applications of recharge wells {{all over the world}} in Chapter II, whereas available theoretical solutions are reviewed in chapter III. The review indicates that free recharge conditions are analysed using slug theories and mirror image type curve analysis is helpful in dealing with forced recharge cases. Many slug test and pumping test theories developed focus either on simplistic recharge conditions or homogeneous hydro-geological conditions. Also, separate developments exist in the areas of large diameter well and flow to multi-aquifer system. These developments are mainly concentrated on constant wellhead boundary conditions with no well loss. Many researchers have dealt effect of pumping on base flow numerically, but the study on the impacts of recharge on base flow has not been noticed. One more practical issue, which has not been studied, is the aquifer clogging during well injection, though related background research on filtration phenomena is comparatively well established. Analytical solution for recharge in a finite aquifer from a large diameter well under variable head is obtained in Chapter IV. Furthermore, issues of analytical solution difficulty, in the available solution with constant head boundary condition are resolved and extended using Discrete Kernel approach to variable heads. Usefulness of choosing the variable head boundary condition lies in the advantage that continuous pouring of water in to the <b>recharge</b> <b>well</b> is not a necessary condition. As well and aquifer clogging is minimum in hard rock terrains, present solution is useful for estimating the pressure heads and recharge rates in the well flooding techniques frequently used in hard rock regions. For the case of free recharge in confined aquifers, available slug test theories do not consider appropriate well storage and well loss, as these may not be significant in the case of short duration test with instantaneous slug. Also slug theories are not extendable to multi-aquifer wells. Analytical solutions are obtained for free recharge condition for both single and multiple layer aquifers in chapter V, also incorporating well loss, well storage and friction loss. Parametric studies are made to see the effect of hydro-geological parameter namely; transmissivity and storativity, on recharge rates and head buildups. Theis (1935) solution is provided with well storage effects for the entire period of recharge, using Duhamel’s convolution theorem. Comparison with Cooper et al. (1967) shows, that the present solution could be useful for long-term non-instantaneous free recharge data analysis. Relationship between diffusivity and time to decay has been developed, which is useful for aquifer parameter estimation using recharge test data. Similar improvement is feasible for other existing type curves also including leaky aquifers. Analytical solutions for free recharge with constant well loss, variable well loss and losses due to friction have been developed. Comparison indicates better solution with losses due friction, which is also a more easily measurable physical parameter as compared to other well loss constants. Free recharge solutions provide unique opportunity to estimate the recharge rates in the individual aquifers of single and multi-layered aquifer. Well bore interaction has been accounted through <b>recharge</b> <b>well</b> injecting water to multi-aquifers. Specific analytical solutions are developed for the cases of free recharge in hard rock multi-layered aquifers. Present state of the art for <b>recharge</b> <b>well</b> considers forced recharge as mirror image of the pumping test solutions, type curves of which are found more difficult to fit in to the recharge test data. Again, deviation in type curve match lies in considering well storage, well clogging and aquifer clogging effects. In chapter VI analytical forced recharge solutions are developed for constant and variable rate of injection. Mirror image Theis (1935) solution is coupled with well storage during the recharge period to improve the existing solution and make it suitable for recharge computation after comparing it with Popodopulos and Cooper (1967) solution. Well bore interaction in case of multi-layered aquifer has been considered. Similar exercises are possible with existing solutions other than Theis (1935) including those for leaky aquifers. Type curves for recharge for various diffusivity ratios have been developed. Constant and variable well loss is considered for forced recharge in single as well as multi-layered aquifer. Results say that present solutions are more accurate in terms of well storage, which has significant influence on well injection as compared to well pumping. In the case of pumping, well storage effects are dominant in the initial times, where as it effects the entire recharge cycle, also depend upon the aquifer diffusivity and the recharge column dimensions. Significant influence of well loss in case of forced well recharge has been taken care of by considering linear trend of deteriorating well condition between times dependant Walton’s well loss constant. In Chapter VII, aquifer clogging, changing with time has been analysed using numerical modelling technique and applying the results of the filtration experiments reported in the literature. Inclined initial piezometric water table condition is found effective towards observation well water level and is considered for simulation of the observation well water level of Hansol project. The methodology is transferable for analyzing other injection project also. Base flow on regional scale is affected by the location, rate of injection and number of wells. In the case of Bamnod injection well project, base flow retained in the aquifer, is reducing with the increase in the quantity of injected water. This conclusion may not always be same everywhere, however, this aspect needs to be investigated. Chapter VIII summaries and highlights the conclusions drawn out of the present research study. It has been summarized that the Chapters IV, V and VI develop analytical solutions for recharge rates under unsteady wellhead condition by coupling existing groundwater flow solution with Duhamel’s convolution theorem. It provides the well storage effects throughout the recharge cycle, which unlike in pumping cases, could be significant in recharge cases. Second foremost specific requirement for a well recharge may be the consideration of head loss. In free recharge cases friction factor per unit diameter of <b>recharge</b> <b>well</b> is found a better physically computable parameter, where as well loss constants suggested by Walton (1962) could bring the head loss effects in the developed solutions for forced recharge. Free and forced recharge solutions developed for single aquifer are further extended to multi-aquifer system with respective head loss effects and well bore interaction. This is an useful contribution owing to the fact that no multi-aquifer solution considers aquifer interactions through <b>recharge</b> <b>well</b> and equivalent single aquifer theory worked for the multi-aquifer system without head loss All the solutions in Chapters IV, V and VI are found sensitive towards well radius and could analyze recharge behavior at the well face with horizontal initial piezometric surface. Simulation of the response in an observation well situated 50 m away from the <b>recharge</b> <b>well</b> is found inappropriate with the present solution. Therefore in the Chapter VII, to solve the solution difficulty, analysis is extended for the observation well, some distant away from the <b>recharge</b> <b>well</b> face, using numerical solution technique. Heterogeneity in the flow medium between the <b>recharge</b> <b>well</b> and the observation well is considered as per the time dependant aquifer clogging, based upon theory of filtration. <b>Recharge</b> <b>well</b> in general has been considered as a technology, which would increase the groundwater storage. With a case study it is found that groundwater regime also plays a crucial role in this respect. Present thesis also provides specific solution to practical issues like; estimation of diffusivity from time to decay of recharge, friction loss in the <b>recharge</b> <b>well,</b> time variant well loss as per <b>recharge</b> <b>well</b> condition, effect of sudden pump shut down, control of injection rates against <b>recharge</b> <b>well</b> over flooding, recharge rates to individual aquifers of a multi-aquifer system and multiple well recharge options. Though the scope of the present research is confined to aquifer-aquiclude system only, it could easily be extended to various other hydro-geological setups also. Unique feature of the applied analytical solution technique lies in the flexibility of transformation between head and flux boundary conditions. This provides an opportunity to compute recharge rates and corresponding heads simultaneously with any kind of boundary conditions...|$|E

However, there are still several challenges for the application of GSHP systems in large scale. This paper raises relevant suggestions for overcoming the existing and potential obstacles. In addition, the developing and applying prospects of GSHP systems in China are also discussed. Ground-source heat pump (GSHP) Current status China...|$|R

To better understand the water demands in this basin, a new groundwater flow model has been created. First, the conceptual model was produced using various Geographic Information System (GIS) applications. A new method allocating digital precipitation data to the smaller drainages within the watershed was used to estimate mountain front <b>recharge.</b> <b>Well</b> data was gathered from both the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR). Depth to bedrock was interpolated from an earlier gravity survey of the area. The current extent of riparian vegetation was determined by recent United States Forest Service aerial photography. GIS shapefiles were created depicting the data necessary for MODFLOW. Second, the numerical MODFLOW model was formed using GMS (Groundwater Modeling System), a graphical user interface for MODFLOW. GMS was used to create the grid, allocate the information from the shapefiles into MODFLOW input files, create the MODFLOW numerical model, and calibrate the model. The model results project potential impacts to the overall sustainability of groundwater within the basin. In the future, the model will be used as an administrative tool to assess alternative land management scenarios and their abilities to sustain or improve the riparian habitat along the San Pedro River...|$|E

This paper includes an Analytical solution, Numerical modeling, Empirical approaches, In-situ test results to predict recharge (rate) mound of the ground-water and capacity of <b>recharge</b> <b>well</b> which is essential for the proper management of suitable artificial ground-water recharge systems to maintain water balance and stop salt water intrusion. Authors have derived analytical equation for predicting growth as well as decline of the ground-water mound depending on the intensity of recharge rate qr with different value of permeability k, depth of pervious strata H and diameter of well d, also studying the effects of variation in the geotechnical parameters on water-table fluctuations. In this paper to study the impact of numerical modeling using quadratic equation for unconfined aquifer base on rainfall intensity P and a change in saturated thickness H with variation in piezometric level. Empirical approaches are for evaluation of correct value of k of an undercharged unconfined aquifer with drawdown s 0, influence zone L, recharge rate qr. In-situ test results give actual correlation between value of recharging rate of well and permeability on field. Authors have verified recharging rate of installed well from all approaches. A result obtained from the various field case studies gives the validation of the derived equation. Scientific quality measures of aquifer water are also recorded...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{difference}} in adoption patterns of water <b>recharge</b> <b>well</b> technology in Mexico City both by local entities and the central city government. The research finds that this technology, originally designed by the central city with the stated purpose of aiding aquifer recharge, was adopted by local entities driven by concerns over flood control. Geophysical realities, complemented by political and socioeconomic factors, are key in deciding the use and type of infiltration technology by local entities. Water policy priorities {{at the local level}} are a decidedly local affair, which makes coordination difficult and thus constitutes a challenge for sustainable water management in Mexico City as a whole. Ineffective formal coordination mechanisms among the three levels of government, and the incentives that explain the uneven adoption of recharge wells by local communities, suggest an alternative approach to metropolitan water governance. In addition to traditional solutions such as regulation and formal metropolitan cooperation bodies, a third path of sustainable water management would involve a division of tasks between high and lower local level governments. Levels of government with the resources and incentives to develop technologies with systemic impacts and that address immediate needs can then "market" or "scale down" these solutions to localities whose incentive structure would lead them to, in effect, implement these solutions. In this way, collective action problems could be sidelined at the metropolitan scale. by José Antonio Correa Ibargüengoitia. Thesis (M. C. P.)

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} the identification of model parameters of groundwatersystems and the conjugative management between the water resources systems, such as dam res-ervoirs, pumping <b>wells</b> and <b>recharging</b> <b>wells.</b> Especially, we introduce the multi-level optimizationmethod (Goal Coordination Method) to solve the identification and management problems ofcomplex water resources systems. In the identification model, after formulating goundwater systems by three dimensional multi-cell model, the total system can be arbitrarily divided into several subsystems. Then, the optimalvalue of model parameters of confined or unconfined aquifers will be decided by iterative calcula-tion of parameter identification in subsystems and interaction balance in total system. On theother hand, management or operation model is decomposed into surface water systems andgroundwater systems. Each subsystem is optimally controlled by using Linear Programming orNon-Linear Programming. Total control policy will be also gained in the basis of multi-leveloptimization method. These approaches are applied to a part of the Nara basin for verification of theory. And wediscuss their effectiveness and limitation...|$|R
40|$|The Biscayne Aquifer is {{a primary}} source of water supply in Southeast Florida. As a coastal aquifer, it is {{threatened}} by saltwater intrusion (SWI) when the natural groundwater flow is altered by over-pumping of groundwater. SWI is detrimental {{to the quality of}} fresh groundwater sources, making the water unfit for drinking due to mixing and reactions with aquifer minerals. Increasing water demand and complex environmental issues thus force water utilities in South Florida to sustainably manage saltwater intrusion and develop alternative water supplies (e. g., aquifer storage and recovery, ASR). ^ The objectives of this study were to develop and use calibrated geochemical models to estimate water quality changes during saline intrusion and during ASR in south Florida. A batch-reaction model of saltwater intrusion was developed and important geochemical reactions were inferred. Additionally, a reactive transport model was developed to assess fate and transport of major ions and trace metals (Fe, As) at the Kissimmee River ASR. Finally, a cost-effective management of saltwater intrusion that involves using abstraction and <b>recharge</b> <b>wells</b> was implemented and optimized for the case of the Biscayne Aquifer. ^ Major processes in the SWI areas were found to be mixing and dissolution-precipitation reactions with calcite and dolomite. Most of the major ions (Cl, Na, K, Mg, SO 4) behaved conservatively during ASR while Ca and alkalinity were affected by carbonate reactions and cation exchange. A complex set of reactions involving thermodynamic equilibrium, kinetics and surface complexation reactions was required in the ASR model to simulate observed concentrations of Fe and As. The saltwater management model aimed at finding optimal locations and flow rates for abstraction and <b>recharge</b> <b>wells.</b> Optimal solutions (i. e., minimum total salt and total cost Pareto front) were produced for the Biscayne Aquifer for scenarios of surface recharge induced by climate change-affected precipitation. In general, abstraction at the maximum rate near the coast and artificial recharge at locations much further inland were found to be optimal. Knowledge developed herein directly supports the understanding of SWI caused by anthropogenic stressors, such as over-pumping and sea level rise, on coastal aquifers. ...|$|R
