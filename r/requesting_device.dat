In the {{proposed}} mechanism, the BCTRqs sent by a MPNC to the ref-MPNC {{are based on the}} aggregate of the received CTRqs from its members' MDEVs at hop- 2. As highlighted in Figure  5, the MPNCs send BCTRq for requesting CTAs from the ref-MPNC by identifying the ‘minimum number of TUs’ and the ‘desired number of TUs’ fields. After receiving the requests, the ref-MPNC can decide to accept or deny the request according to the proposed algorithms, and it notifies the <b>requesting</b> <b>device</b> by sending a CTRp (see Figure  6). The ref-MPNC decision to allocate channel time is based on prioritizing the MPNCs over the MDEVs by granting the MPNCs more TUs.|$|E

With this scheme, the ref-MPNC is used for allocating the channel time to each <b>requesting</b> <b>device</b> at hop- 1. Some of the introduced notions are used by both hop- 1 and hop- 2 access mechanisms, namely, bulk channel time requests and flag metric notions. Other notions are introduced only to the hop- 1 resource allocation mechanism, namely dynamic superframe and utilization threshold notions. Under the utilization thresholds, two different thresholds are proposed {{to be used in}} the resource allocation mechanisms at hop- 1, the superframe utilization threshold and the CTAP threshold.|$|E

The position can be known by getting it from mobile phone network, or from another positioning service, such as GPS. Mobile location-based system is complex and requires the integration of many different technology components into one seamless system. This paper describes on the design {{and implementation of the}} three location-based system components, which are the location server simulator, location service application and device client application. The location server simulator processes the location request and returns simulated positioning data to the location service application. The location service application is aimed at providing mobile users the map of their current position based on the positioning data from the simulator. It senses what the display capabilities the <b>requesting</b> <b>device</b> has and delivers the map accordingly. The last component is a small software entity that runs on Java phones such as Motorola A 835, Nokia 7610, and SonyEricssonP 900.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an architecture and a {{proof of concept}} implementation of a security infrastructure for mobile devices in an infrastructure based pervasive environment. The security infrastructure primarily consists of two parts, the policy engine and the policy enforcement mechanism. Each mobile device within a pervasive environment is equipped with its own policy enforcement mechanism and is responsible for protecting its resources. A mobile device consults the nearest policy server, notifies its current state including its present user, network presence, other accessible devices and location information if available. Using this information the policy server queries the “Rei ” engine to dynamically create a policy certificate and issues it to the <b>requesting</b> <b>device.</b> The system wide policy is described in a semantic language “Rei”, a lightweight and extensible language which is able to express comprehensive policies using domain specific information. The “Rei”policy engine is able to dynamically decide what rights, prohibitions, obligations, dispensations an actor has on the domain actions. A policy certificate is created and issued to the device. The policy certificate contains a set of granted permissions and a validity period and scope within which the permissions are valid. The policy certificate can be revoked by the policy enforcer based on expiration of the validity period {{or a combination of}} timeout, loss of contact with an assigned network.

40|$|The {{personal}} {{area network}} (PAN) coordinator can assign a guaranteed time slot (GTS) to allocate a particular duration for <b>requested</b> <b>devices</b> in IEEE  802. 15. 4 beacon-enabled mode. The main challenge in the GTS mechanism is how to let the PAN coordinator allocate time slot duration for the devices which request a GTS. If the allocated devices use the GTS partially or the traffic pattern is not suitable, wasted bandwidth will increase, which degrades the performance of the network. In order to overcome the abovementioned problem, this paper proposes the Partitioned GTS Allocation Scheme (PEGAS) for IEEE 802. 15. 4  networks.

40|$|Abstract — Now a day’s mobile {{devices have}} inbuilt GPS {{systems such as}} {{smartphones}} and PDAs which plays as increasingly important role in location based services. In location – based applications and services users require proving their locations at a particular time. There are lots of applications in market that helps to track someone’s location. As location proof plays {{a critical role in}} enabling these applications, they are location – sensitive. The common gain of all these applications is that they offer certain geographical location of a person carrying GPS enabled device. But sometimes users lie about their locations. Location – Based Services (LBS) personalize the service they provide or grant access to resources according to the current location of users. They are used in a variety of contexts, such as real-time traffic monitoring, discount tied to the visit of a particular shop. In most of current schemes, the location of a user/device is determined by the device itself (eg. through GPS) and forwarded to the LBS provider. By doing so, a user can cheat by having his device transmitting a false location to gain access to unauthorized resources, thus raising the issue of verifying the position claimed by a particular user. To counter this threat, LBS should ideally require the <b>requesting</b> <b>device</b> to formally prove that it really is at the claimed location. This notion has been formalized through the concept of location proof which is a proves that someone was at a particular location at a specific moment in time...|$|E

Yet, the usage of Cloud Computing requires the consideration of new challenges regarding data security, which pose a serious threat to the adoption of Cloud Computing. This article presents results from the EU-funded PaaSword project, which aims at increasing the trust in Cloud Computing. A holistic data security framework will be developed during the project, whereby the focus is on software developers, who shall be supported during the development of secure cloud applications and services. Therefore, firstly, the underlying architecture concept for secure storage of data is introduced. The context-based access control component is described in further details afterwards. The central aspect of this access control component is a context-based access control model, which can be used by developers to annotate data access objects. The access control model itself builds upon an attribute-based access control model. Thereby, access rights are granted through the evaluation of access rules, which take context attributes into account. Such attributes might, e. g., be the role of a user within an organization, the IP address or type of the <b>requesting</b> <b>device.</b> The PaaSword access control model conceptualizes aspects which shall be considered during the selection of data access rules and with which the context-based access control model determines under which circumstances an access request on which data is allowed. The formulation of such rules is based on the XACML standard, which allows combining single rules with context conditions to more complex policies...|$|E
