5000|$|Ceropegia is a genus {{of plants}} {{within the family}} Apocynaceae, native to Africa, {{southern}} Asia, and Australia. [...] It was named by Carl Linnaeus, who first described this genus in volume 1 of his Species plantarum, which appeared in 1753. Linnaeus thought that the flowers looked like a fountain of wax. From this the scientific name was derived: ‘keros’ meaning wax and ‘pege’ meaning fountain (Pooley, 1998). They have many common names including lantern flower, parasol flower, parachute flower, bushman’s pipe, string of hearts, snake creeper, wine-glass vine, <b>rosary</b> <b>vine,</b> and necklace vine.|$|E

When exposed to sufficient light {{they have a}} deep green colour; under insufficient lighting the leaves are pale green. With age it develops a woody caudex at its base. The roots, and occasionally the stems, will often develop tubers. On the stems these form at nodes and are likely {{the reason for the}} common name of <b>rosary</b> <b>vine.</b>|$|E
