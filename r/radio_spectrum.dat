40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{fundamentals of}} {{formation of the}} supernova remnant (SNR) continuum <b>radio</b> <b>spectra</b> are presented in this review. Mainly based on the Fermi 1 theory - also known as diffuse shock acceleration (DSA) - the different shapes (linear or curved in log-log scale) of SNR <b>radio</b> <b>spectra</b> are predicted for both young and evolved SNRs. On the other hand, some particular forms of spectra of older SNRs can be predicted by including the additional processes such as Fermi 2 acceleration mechanism or thermal bremsstrahlung radiation. Also, all of these theoretically predicted forms of <b>radio</b> <b>spectra</b> are compared with real spectra obtained from observations. Finally this review can represent some kind of "atlas" with initial patterns for {{the different kinds of}} SNR <b>radio</b> <b>spectra</b> - it should be helpful for radio astronomers in their interpretation of the observed <b>radio</b> <b>spectra.</b> Comment: accepted in Ap&S...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{have used}} the 20 largest radio {{continuum}} catalogues contained in VizieR (CDS) to determine <b>radio</b> continuum <b>spectra</b> between wavelengths of 2 cm and 1 m. For 67, 000 out of the 3. 5 million catalogued sources we could extract <b>radio</b> <b>spectra</b> with measurements at at least 3 independent frequencies. These have been validated by comparison with existing spectral indices from the literature. Our <b>radio</b> <b>spectra</b> data base was searched for Gigahertz peaked source candidates, which we then observed quasi-simultaneously with the Effelsberg 100 -m radio telescope at 6 cm (4. 85 GHz), 2. 8 cm (10. 45 GHz), and 9 mm (32 GHz). This is an efficient procedure to discover new Gigahertz peaked sources, which {{are believed to be}} AGNs {{at the beginning of their}} radio evolution. We are generalizing the method by using VO capabilities to (i) identify pertinent radio catalogues in the VO registry using Uniform Content Descriptions (UCDs), (ii) extract relevant data, and (iii) normalize these for the determination of <b>radio</b> <b>spectra.</b> Software allowing semi-automated information retrieval is being developed within the framework of the European VO-TECH project. The potential usage of all available radio catalogues will strongly increase the number of independent radio source cross-correlations and <b>radio</b> <b>spectra.</b> The results are progressively being made available to the community through the CDS services...|$|R
40|$|The KDA (Kaiser, Dennett-Thorpe & Alexander, 1997) EXT model, that is, the {{extension}} of the KDA model of FR (Faranoff & Riley) II-type source evolution, is applied and confronted with the observational data for selected FR II-type radio sources with significantly aged <b>radio</b> <b>spectra.</b> A sample of FR II-type radio galaxies with <b>radio</b> <b>spectra</b> strongly bent at their highest frequencies is used for testing the usefulness of the KDA EXT model. The dynamical evolution of FR II-type sources predicted with the KDA EXT model is briefly presented and discussed. The results are then compared to the ones obtained with the classical KDA approach, assuming the source's continuous injection and self-similarity. The results and corresponding diagrams obtained for the eight sample sources indicate that the KDA EXT model predicts the observed <b>radio</b> <b>spectra</b> significantly better than the best spectral fit provided by the original KDA model.

25|$|Given {{the high}} star-forming rates of GPs generally, they are {{expected}} to host a large number of Supernovae. Supernovae accelerate electrons to high energies, near to the speed of light, which may then emit synchrotron radiation in <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> frequencies.|$|E

25|$|The XM {{radio signal}} was {{broadcast}} on 6 separate radio carriers within the 12.5MHz allocation. The entire {{content of the}} radio service, including both data and audio content, was represented by only two carriers. The other 4 carriers carried duplicates of the same content to achieve redundancy through signal diversity. The data on each carrier is encoded using time-delayed and error-correction schemes to enhance availability.

Using Planck and simultaneous auxiliary radio data ranging from 1 GHz to 857 GHz, spectra for 104 bright northern extragalactic radio sources (most of them AGN) have been assembled; in these, the various stages of flare development can be identified. The results are compared with theoretical models describing relativistic jets.

40|$|We {{describe}} radio observations at 244 and 610 MHz of {{a sample}} of 20 luminous and ultra-luminous IRAS galaxies. These are a sub-set {{of a sample}} of 31 objects that have well-measured <b>radio</b> <b>spectra</b> up to at least 23 GHz. The <b>radio</b> <b>spectra</b> of these objects below 1. 4 GHz show {{a great variety of}} forms and are rarely a simple power-law extrapolation of the synchrotron spectra at higher frequencies. Most objects of this class have spectral turn-overs or bends in their <b>radio</b> <b>spectra.</b> We interpret these spectra in terms of free-free absorption in the starburst environment. Several objects show <b>radio</b> <b>spectra</b> with two components having free-free turn-overs at different frequencies (including Arp 220 and Arp 299), indicating that synchrotron emission originates from regions with very different emission measures. In these sources, using a simple model for the supernova rate, we estimate the time for which synchrotron emission is subject to strong free-free absorption by ionized gas, and compare this to expected HII region lifetimes. We find that the ionized gas lifetimes are an order of magnitude larger than plausible lifetimes for individual HII regions. We discuss the implications of this result and argue that those sources which have a significant radio component with strong free-free absorption are those in which the star formation rate is still increasing with time. We note that if ionization losses modify the intrinsic synchrotron spectrum so that it steepens toward higher frequencies, the often observed deficit in fluxes higher than ~ 10 GHz would be much reduced.

The results of statistical analysis of the dependence of X-ray luminosity on combined functions of optical and radio luminosity show that the dependence on both luminosities is important. However, statistically significant differences are found between subsamples of flat <b>radio</b> <b>spectra</b> quasars and steep <b>radio</b> <b>spectra</b> quasars with regard to dependence of X-ray luminosity on only radio luminosity. The data are consistent with radio-loud quasars having a physical component, not directly related to the optical luminosity, which produces the core radio luminosity plus 'extra' X-ray emission...|$|R

25|$|Astronomers {{have been}} unable to observe Sgr A* in the optical {{spectrum}} because of the effect of 25 magnitudes of extinction by dust and gas between the source and Earth. Several teams of researchers have attempted to image Sagittarius A* in the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). The current highest-resolution measurement, made at a wavelength of 1.3 mm, indicated an angular diameter for the source of 37 μas. At a distance of 26,000 light-years, this yields a diameter of 44 million kilometers. For comparison, Earth is 150 million kilometers from the Sun, and Mercury is 46 million kilometers from the Sun at perihelion. The proper motion of Sgr A* is approximately −2.70mas per year for the right ascension and −5.6mas per year for the declination.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the great}} {{technical}} challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth, potentially three {{times that of the}} existing black-and-white standards, and not use an excessive amount of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum.</b> In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee approved an all-electronic Compatible color system developed by RCA, which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image.
