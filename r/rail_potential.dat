40|$|Running rails used as {{a return}} {{conductor}} and ungrounded scheme have been widely adopted in DC traction power systems. Due to the longitudinal resistance of running rails and insulation resistance of rail-to-ground, {{there will be a}} potential rise between running rails and the ground when return current flows through the running rails, which is known as <b>rail</b> <b>potential.</b> At present, abnormal rise of <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> exists widely in DC traction power systems. The present <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> model still cannot simulate and explain the abnormal <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> in the system. Based on the analysis of power distribution with multiple trains running in multiple sections, a dynamic simulation model of <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> in the whole line is proposed. The dynamic distribution of <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> and stray current in DC traction power systems when multiple trains run in multiple sections is analyzed, and the impact of traction current distribution on <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> is evaluated.

40|$|DC {{traction}} power system with running rails as reflux conductor {{has been adopted}} in Guangzhou Metro Line 8. During {{the operation of the}} Guangzhou Metro Line, a high <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> has been observed, and the leakage of stray current increases significantly. Because of the electrical connectivity of the catenary, over zone feeding of traction current may exist when multiple trains run in multiple traction substations. Guangzhou Metro Line 8 suspects that over zone feeding of traction current is the major cause of the high <b>rail</b> <b>potential.</b> In this paper, a unified chain model of DC {{traction power}} system is proposed to simulate the distribution of <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> and stray current. Field tests and simulations have been carried out to study whether over zone feeding has an impact on <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> and stray current.

40|$|Direct current (DC) {{traction}} power systems {{are widely used}} in metro transport systems, with running rails usually being used as return conductors. When traction current flows through the running rails, a potential voltage known as “rail potential” is generated between the rails and ground. Currently, abnormal rises of <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> exist in many railway lines during the operation of railway systems. Excessively high rail potentials {{pose a threat to}} human life and to devices connected to the rails. In this paper, the effect of regenerative power distribution on <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> is analyzed. Maximum safety regenerative power tracking is proposed for the control of maximum absolute <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> and energy consumption during the operation of DC {{traction power}} systems. The dwell time of multiple trains at each station and the trigger voltage of the regenerative energy absorbing device (READ) are optimized based on an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to manage the distribution of regenerative power. In this way, the maximum absolute <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> and energy consumption of DC traction power systems can be reduced. The operation data of Guangzhou Metro Line 2 are used in the simulations, and the results show that the scheme can reduce the maximum absolute <b>rail</b> <b>potential</b> and energy consumption effectively and guarantee the safety in energy saving of DC traction power systems...|$|E

40|$|Rail {{safety is}} closely controlled, {{but there is}} less {{supervision}} of the actual road, its construction and condition. Safety {{is the responsibility of}} the road user, not the provider. This is a feature of the common law, including the rule that no liability attaches to road omissions, and of legislation governing road and rail. It has its roots in the many centuries of highway development. New Zealand legislation has few safety duties for road owners, but very comprehensive and strict obligations for railways. This is also true internationally, except that in some jurisdictions there are enhanced controls on road. Health and safety laws may not cover the public safety aspects of roads, but they do cover all aspects of railways.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the feasibility of a passenger rail service operating on a current rail line in Canterbury, known as the Main North Line, which connects the Waimakariri District to Christchurch. The Main North Line runs through the two main urban areas of the Waimakariri District: Rangiora and Kaiapoi. The need for research into the potential use of the Main North Line for passenger services has arisen due to increasing car congestion on arterial roads between the Waimakariri District and Christchurch. All traffic coming from the Waimakariri District into Christchurch must cross the Waimakariri River, creating a transport bottleneck. An assessment of the location of the Main North Line was conducted with respect to the travel needs of Waimakariri District residents using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to investigate how far residents live and work from the line and resident surveys to determine whether people would use rail as their main mode of travel into Christchurch. Assessment of the infrastructure was with regard to the locations of potential railways stations and the capabilities of the infrastructure for supporting different levels of passenger service. National and regional transport strategies are placing more importance on the transportation of people and freight by way of <b>rail.</b> A <b>potential</b> <b>rail</b> service for Canterbury will therefore likely include national and regional stakeholders in co-operation with a private service operator, as currently occurs in Wellington and Auckland. An average of 71 % of Waimakariri District residents stated they would switch to rail as their main mode of transport for the journey into Christchurch. GIS analysis found that the number of journeys which start in the Waimakariri District and terminate within 1 km of Christchurch stations is around 610 which increases to around 4, 300 if connecting bus services were utilised in Christchurch...|$|R
