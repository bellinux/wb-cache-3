Paddy (unmilled rice) is the crop and the other crops grown are blackgram, banana, coconut, gingelly, ragi, <b>red</b> <b>gram,</b> green gram, {{sugarcane}} and maize. The total percentage of land fit for cultivation is 58%. There are three seasons for agriculture in Thanjavur – Kuruvai (June to September), Samba (August to January) and Thaladi (September, October to February, March). The total rice production has been maintained at 10.615 L.M.T and 7.077 L.M.T. The city acts as a focal point for food grains transported from the adjoining areas of the Cauvery Delta. Organic farming is gradually becoming known to the farmers of Thanjavur. To maximise agricultural produce, organic farming is being implemented. Though agriculture is the main economic activity, only 7% of the population is involved in it. There is a lot of agricultural related trading that forms the key economic activity in the city.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamism}} of the farming sector, and its environment, {{is reflected in}} developments {{in the design of}} new insurance products. In the last decade two types of new products have been introduced. In some cases these have partially displaced existing covers; in others they have resulted in demand from new clients. Implementation of technology in farming usually involves investment. Such changes also frequently alter the risk profile of the enterprise. There are occasions when insurance can be a key component in a range of risk management strategies for the insurers. From an administrative point of view bank-insurer linkages make a lot of sense, since both these providers of financial services require similar client data. This type of link, crop insurance and loans, is already very common, both in developing and developed agriculture. The vast, heavily subsidized scheme in India is largely linked to bank lending. So instead of the usual policy wording, such as indemnity, or range of indemnity levels, or a per hectare basis for a given crop, for losses from specific causes, the coupon merely gives a monetary sum which becomes payable on certification that the named weather event, of specified severity, has occurred. Again the role of state is very important making available crop insurance on a large scale, as they are public good in nature. Recently in Odisha, for crops such as Niger, cotton, <b>red</b> <b>grams,</b> jute, turmeric, ginger and banana, the farmers of selected blocks in some district could take advantage of the scheme. Because indemnity claim is settled only on the basis of yield data furnished by the State government. Hence the criteria that is based on requisite number of crop cutting experiments conducted under general crop estimation surveys should be supported by State to offer desired result in crop insurance...|$|R
40|$|A general {{procedure}} for manipulating protoplasts of three Streptomyces rimosus strains was developed. More than 50 % regeneration efficiency {{was obtained by}} optimizing the osmotic stabilizer concentrations and modifying the plating procedure. Preparation and regeneration of protoplasts were studied by both phase-contrast and electron microscopy. After cell wall degradation with lysozyme, protoplasts about 1, 000 to 1, 500 nm in diameter appeared. The reversion process exhibited normal and aberrant regeneration of protoplasts to hyphae and to spherical cells, respectively. Spherical cells contained no α, ε-ll-diaminopimelic acid and were colorless or <b>red</b> after <b>Gram</b> staining. They showed consistent stability during at least five subsequent subcultivations. However, the omission of glycine from the precultivation medium reduced the unusual process of regeneration almost completely.

Cornell was given $15 million to work toward sustainable agricultural and rural development with colleagues in developing countries It was in connection with his duties as CIIFAD director that Dr. Uphoff learned about SRI in Madagascar in 1993 and was able to travel to many other countries to encourage other to learn about and evaluate SRI's agroecological methods, which have now been extended or extrapolated to other crops: wheat, finger millet, sugarcane, teff, green, <b>red</b> and black <b>grams,</b> and several vegetables. Since 1997, Uphoff has given presentations on SRI in 41 countries. Uphoff’s approach has been to work from the ground up, seeking the input and participation of farmers in developing countries, while also communicating with the scientific community and with policy makers, civil society and the private sector. As he states, “In part because most agricultural scientists have been so skeptical, even dismissive of SRI, our work has usually begun with NGO's and the farmers they assist. There have been a few agricultural researchers who have had open minds and have taken an interest in SRI from the outset, but mostly we have developed our understanding of SRI and have made adaptations in close association with farmers. Now the scientific community is becoming more interested.”4 5 ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} moderate alcohol consumption on fat distribution, adipose tissue secreted proteins (adiponectin and resistin), and insulin sensitivity in healthy middle-aged men with abdominal obesity. Research Methods and Procedures: Thirty-four healthy men between 35 and 70 years old, with increased waist circumference (>= 94 cm), participated in a randomized, controlled cross-over design trial. They drank 450 mL of <b>red</b> wine (40 <b>grams</b> of alcohol) or 450 mL of de-alcoholized red wine daily during 4 weeks. At {{the end of each}} treatment period, fat distribution, adipose tissue proteins, and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) were measured. Results: Subcutaneous and abdominal fat contents and body weight did not change after 4 weeks of moderate alcohol consumption. Liver fat (quip index) was slightly higher after consumption of red wine (6. 8 +/- 0. 1) as compared with de-alcoholized red wine (6. 5 0. 1) but not significantly different (p = 0. 09). Plasma adiponectin concentration increased (p < 0. 01) to 6. 0 +/- 0. 1 mu g/mL after 28 days of moderate alcohol consumption compared with de-alcoholized red wine (5. 5 +/- 0. 1 mu g/mL). Serum resistin concentrations and ISI were not affected by alcohol consumption. Percentage changes in serum resistin correlated significantly with changes in ISI (r = - 0. 69, p < 0. 01), whereas this correlation was not present between changes in plasma adiponectin and IST (r = 0. 31, p = 0. 22). Discussion: Moderate alcohol consumption for 4 weeks is not associated with differences in subcutaneous and abdominal fat contents or body weight. Thus, the 10 % increase in adiponectin was not associated with a change in fat distribution or body weight chang...|$|R

30|$|A 38 -year-old male {{sustained}} {{trauma to}} the left eye while hammering farm machinery without protective eyewear. At presentation, 15 h later, the visual acuity (VA) was hand movements. Anterior segment examination confirmed a 3 -mm linear corneal laceration with iris tissue and lens capsule to the wound. A fibrinous reaction and 0.5 -mm hypopyon were evident. Fundoscopy revealed a healthy posterior pole, with no vitritis. A CT scan of the orbit identified {{the presence of a}} metallic intraocular foreign body (IOFB). The patient proceeded to primary repair, pars plana lensectomy, vitrectomy, removal of IOFB, and partial air-fluid exchange. The patient was left aphakic. Intraoperatively, dense vitritis and florid vasculitis, obscuring the optic disc and vessels, were noted to have developed in the short interval between presentation and surgery. A vitreous specimen was sent for microbiologic evaluation, and intravitreal vancomycin 1 mg/ 0.1 ml, ceftazidime 2.25 mg/ 0.1 ml, dexamethasone 0.4 mg/ 0.1 ml, and intravenous moxifloxacin 400 mg were administered. On post-operative day 1, VA dropped to light perception, with a 2 -mm hypopyon and absent <b>red</b> reflex. Initial <b>gram</b> stain of the vitreous specimen identified gram-positive cocci in pairs. A second intravitreal injection of vancomycin 1 mg/ 0.1 ml was administered empirically. Oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily and topical fortified vancomycin, fortified ceftazidime, and prednisolone 1 % were commenced. On post-operative day 2, there was no clinical improvement. The primary organism was identified as vancomycin-resistant E. gallinarum, sensitive to ampicillin and gentamicin. Light growth of a gram-negative bacillus was also seen. Intravitreal ampicillin 5 mg/ 0.1 ml and amikacin 0.4 mg/ 0.1 ml were administered. A 2 -week course of intravenous ampicillin 2 g every 4 h was commenced, plus intravenous clindamycin 600 mg every 8 h and oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily to cover the gram-negative organism (subsequently identified as an Acinetobacter species). Topical therapy was switched to fortified gentamicin and prednisolone 1 %. The infection responded quickly to this regime, and topical therapy was tapered over subsequent weeks. Recovery was complicated by subsequent inferior retinal detachment, which underwent successful surgical management. At 7 months post-injury, the VA improves to 20 / 80 (aphakic correction).|$|R
