40|$|The Shuttle/Centaur {{high energy}} upper stage vehicle thermal environments were {{more severe than}} {{previous}} Centaur vehicle thermal environments, creating {{need for a new}} hydrazine <b>fuel</b> <b>line</b> thermal control technique. Constant power heaters did not satisfy power dissipation requirements, because the power required to maintain <b>fuel</b> <b>line</b> thermal control during cold conditions exceeded the maximum power allowable during hot conditions. Therefore, a Raychem Thermolimit self-regulating heater was selected for this application, and was attached to the hydrazine <b>fuel</b> <b>line</b> with Kapton and aluminum foil tapes. Fuel line/heater thermal modeling and subsequent thermal vacuum chamber testing simulated heater thermal performance during all worst-case Shuttle/Centaur thermal environmental conditions. <b>Fuel</b> <b>line</b> temperatures were maintained between the 4 C to 71 C limits during all analytical and test cases. Finally, the thermal model predictions were correlated with the test data, thereby ensuring that the model would provide satisfactory predictions for future missions and/or vehicles...|$|R

5000|$|The {{fuel system}} of a hit-and-miss engine {{consists}} of a <b>fuel</b> tank, <b>fuel</b> <b>line,</b> check valve and fuel mixer. The fuel tank most typically holds gasoline but many users would start the engines with gasoline and then switch over to a cheaper fuel such as kerosene or diesel [...] The <b>fuel</b> <b>line</b> connects the <b>fuel</b> tank to the mixer. Along the <b>fuel</b> <b>line,</b> a check valve keeps the fuel from running back to the tank between combustion strokes. The mixer creates the correct fuel-air mixture {{by means of a}} needle valve attached to a weighted or spring-loaded piston usually in conjunction with an oil-damped dashpot.|$|R

Based on household data from Germany, figures that would result from different <b>fuel</b> poverty <b>lines</b> are derived. Different <b>fuel</b> poverty <b>lines</b> yield highly different results with respect to which households are identified as fuel poor.

5000|$|In an {{aircraft}} with a reciprocating fuel injected engine a hot start {{is a condition}} where an engine start is attempted {{after it has been}} run, achieved operating temperature, and then recently shut down. The engine is [...] "hot" [...] and hence the terminology hot start. When a reciprocating fuel injected engine is shut down, the residual engine heat dissipates into the air and the surrounding aircraft structure. Some of this heat is transferred to the engine <b>fuel</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>fuel</b> injector <b>lines</b> in the engine compartment and, because no fuel is flowing in the lines to cool them as would be under normal operating conditions, the fuel may vaporize or [...] "boil" [...] within these <b>fuel</b> <b>lines</b> creating a condition called vapor lock. This combination of liquid fuel and vaporized fuel within the <b>fuel</b> <b>line</b> will result in inconsistent fuel availability to the engine fuel pump and fuel injection system. If severe, the fuel pumps can [...] "cavitate" [...] (when the pumping chamber fills with fuel vapor rather than liquid fuel) and become ineffective. The vapor in the <b>fuel</b> <b>lines</b> and loss of fuel pump effectiveness result in inconsistent fuel flow to the engine fuel injectors and ultimately the cylinders resulting difficult starting. Vapor lock can also occur in flight in some aircraft resulting in a rough running engine or engine stoppage.|$|R

25|$|A static {{discharge}} {{in the presence}} of air or oxygen can create ozone. Ozone can degrade rubber parts. Many elastomers are sensitive to ozone cracking. Exposure to ozone creates deep penetrative cracks in critical components like gaskets and O-rings. <b>Fuel</b> <b>lines</b> are also susceptible to the problem unless preventive action is taken. Preventive measures include adding anti-ozonants to the rubber mix, or using an ozone-resistant elastomer. Fires from cracked <b>fuel</b> <b>lines</b> have been a problem on vehicles, especially in the engine compartments where ozone can be produced by electrical equipment.|$|R
50|$|Fuel system icing {{inhibitor}} (FSII) is an additive to aviation fuels that prevents {{the formation of}} ice in <b>fuel</b> <b>lines.</b> FSII is sometimes referred to by the registered, genericized trademark Prist. Jet fuel can contain {{a small amount of}} dissolved water that does not appear in droplet form. As an aircraft gains altitude, the temperature drops and Jet fuel's capacity to hold water is diminished. Dissolved water can separate out and could become a serious problem if it freezes in <b>fuel</b> <b>lines</b> or filters, blocking the flow of fuel and shutting down an engine.|$|R
