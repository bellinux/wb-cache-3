50|$|Activated G {{proteins}} {{are able}} to couple to multiple downstream effectors and can therefore control a number of distinct signalling pathways (a characteristic known as pleiotropy). The extent to which RhoG regulates these pathways is poorly understood thus far, however, one specific pathway downstream of RhoG has received much attention and is therefore well characterised. This pathway involves RhoG-dependent activation of Rac via the DOCK (dedicator of cytokinesis)-family of GEFs. This family is divided into four subfamilies (A-D) and it is subfamilies A and B {{that are involved in}} the pathway described here. Dock180, the archetypal member of this family, is seen as an atypical GEF in that efficient GEF activity requires the presence of the DOCK-binding protein ELMO (engulfment and cell motility) which binds RhoG at its N-terminus. The proposed model for RhoG-dependent Rac activation involves recruitment of the ELMO/Dock180 complex to activated RhoG at the plasma membrane and this <b>relocalisation,</b> together with an ELMO-dependent conformational change in Dock180, is sufficient to promote GTP-loading of Rac. RhoG-mediated Rac signalling has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth and cell migration in mammalian cells as well as phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in C. elegans.|$|E

Hope S.

Common techniques either match the current image against keyframes with known poses coming from a tracker, or establish 2 D-to- 3 D correspondences between keypoints in the current image and points in the scene in order to estimate the camera pose. Recently, regression forests have become a popular alternative to establish such correspondences.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{real-time}} dense scene reconstruction from handheld cameras, one key aspect to enable robust operation {{is the ability to}} relocalise in a previously mapped environment or after loss of measurement. Tasks such as operating on a workspace, where moving objects and occlusions are likely, require a recovery competence in order to be useful. For RGBD cameras, this must also include the ability to relocalise in areas with reduced visual texture. This paper describes a method for <b>relocalisation</b> of a freely moving RGBD camera in small workspaces. The approach combines both 2 D image and 3 D depth information to estimate the full 6 D camera pose. The method uses a general regression over a set of synthetic views distributed throughout an informed estimate of possible camera viewpoints. The resulting <b>relocalisation</b> is accurate and works faster than framerate and the system’s performance is demonstrated through a comparison against visual and geometric feature matching <b>relocalisation</b> techniques on sequences with moving objects and minimal texture. ...|$|E

Auto-retrieval involves {{a combination of}} guided operation to direct the vehicle through obstacles using a human pilot and autonomous operation to navigate the vehicle on its return or during re-exploration. This approach is useful in tasks such as industrial inspection and monitoring, and in particular to operate indoors in GPS-denied environments. Our <b>relocalisation</b> method-ology contrasts two sources of information: depth data and feature co-visibility but in a novel manner that validates matches before a RANSAC procedure.

NPM and p 14 arf displayed a diffuse nuclear staining in most normal bronchial tissue. The fraction of biopsies displaying an increased MDM 2 staining or a nucleolar <b>relocalisation</b> of NPM increased at mild and moderate dysplasia, respectively. Two different modifications occurred in p 14 arf expression, i. e. its loss or its nucleolar <b>relocalisation,</b> both increasing at severe dysplasia and both being associated with high MDM 2 expression. In addition, the nucleolar <b>relocalisation</b> of p 14 arf was associated with that of NPM. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that NPM and p 14 arf either co-localised in the nucleoplasm or in the nucleoli, before {{and as a result}} of severe dysplasia, respectively.

Thus, changes occur in murine double minute clone 2, p 14 alternate reading frame and nucleophosmin level of expression and/or cellular distribution during early steps of lung carcinogenesis.

In mouse thyroid development, the midline primordium bifurcates and two lobes relocalise cranially along the bilateral pair of carotid arteries. In hedgehog-deficient mice, thyroid tissue always develops along the ectopically and asymmetrically positioned carotid arteries, suggesting that, in mice (as in zebrafish), co-developing major arteries define the position of the thyroid. The similarity between zebrafish and mouse mutant phenotypes further indicates that thyroid <b>relocalisation</b> involves two morphogenetic phases, and that variation in the second phase accounts for species-specific differences in thyroid morphology.

40|$|The {{sustainability}} {{and resilience}} of agrifood systems are generally considered either through the sustainable development paradigm, {{which focuses on}} the interactions between agriculture and the environment and often neglects consumption and food issues, or through the <b>relocalisation</b> paradigm, which prevails {{in the literature on}} alternative food systems and social movements. Because of its focus on direct producerconsumer relations, the <b>relocalisation</b> perspective suggests a possible transition pathway, but does not fully address the diversity of interdependencies in agrifood systems (food being largely processed, distributed and provided by intermediaries) and therefore fails to effectively reconnect agriculture and food issues. This article shows the need to consider the possible reconnections between agricultural, food and environmental issues from a perspective that takes this diversity in agrifood systems into account.

40|$|Aggregations of fused in sarcoma (FUS), a {{multifunctional}} RNA processing protein, {{define a}} pathological subtype of both frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS), whilst mutations in the FUS gene are causative for ALS. To model the impact of FUS mutations, expression vectors containing the entire genomic sequence of FUS, up and downstream regions, and native promoter sequences have been generated. The constructs have been tagged with an mCherry fluorescent tag, and three separate pathological mutations (R 244 C, R 521 C, and P 525 L) have been separately inserted. Transgenic mice have been generated using the WT and P 525 L FUS vectors to provide a highly physiological model of FUS in disease. Within transfected HEK 293 cells, insertion of the P 525 L and R 521 C FUS mutations leads to <b>relocalisation</b> of FUS from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. R 521 C and P 525 L mutant FUS incorporates into cytoplasmic aggregations of untranslated mRNA and RNA binding proteins known as stress granules. The strong <b>relocalisation</b> seen with P 525 L-FUS {{is associated with a}} gain of cytotoxicity. Reversal of this cytoplasmic <b>relocalisation</b> by demethylation of FUS rescues this cytotoxicity, suggesting a toxic gain of cytoplasmic function in the majority of FUS mutations. By contrast, insertion of the R 244 C mutation leads to neither <b>relocalisation,</b> stress granule association, nor cytotoxicity. Notably the R 244 C mutation, located away from the nuclear localization domain in which the majority of FUS mutations are found, leads to the presence of smaller FUS fragments in western blot analyses. These fragments appear not to be due to splicing defects in FUS but rather are due to post-translational modifications or aberrant protein cleavage. These data suggest an alternative pathway for FUS toxicity based upon a nuclear loss of function. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E

Although most foods are derived from the land, the territorial link between product {{and place in the}} United Kingdom has been eroded by industrialised farming systems, favourable agricultural support policies and the dominance of increasingly globalised food supply chains by agribusiness, large food processors and corporate retailers. While ensuring regular and standardised food supplies, these processes have also resulted in overproduction, collapsing farm-gate returns and rising public fears about food safety. Thus interest is growing in the potential for developing 'alternative' or 'relocalised' food systems based on quality, traceability and shorter supply chains. The research project had six aims: to conceptualise food <b>relocalisation</b> to compare the extent of food <b>relocalisation</b> in the West Midlands and South West regions of England to analyse institutional strategies for promoting food <b>relocalisation</b> to examine producer attempts to develop local food networks to explore consumer perceptions of local food products to examine the policy implications of food <b>relocalisation</b> Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to unravel the complex networks operating between producers, consumers and institutions. The main outputs of the research were: an informed conceptualisation of food relocalisation; an explanation of current food <b>relocalisation</b> processes in the two regions; and a set of policy recommendations for the future development of sustainable local food supply systems. This data collection consists of the 125 qualitative interviews conducted for the project; no quantitative data are included. Main Topics : The dataset comprises 125 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with respondents who had a professional or personal interest in local and regional foods. The interviews were conducted in three consecutive phases (labelled 2 - 4 below, phase 1 being a review). Interviews in each phase were conducted simultaneously in both regions covered. Phase 2 of the research examined the regional and local policy environments for food <b>relocalisation</b> through interviews with 45 regional policy strategists, county council and local government employees (e. g. planners, economic and tourism development officers), representatives of membership bodies and representatives of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Phase 3 comprised interviews with 40 farmers, food and drink processors and retailers, all of which were small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The interviews covered perceptions of the Processing and Marketing Grant and Rural Enterprise Scheme (food-related measures only) of the England Rural Development Programme; development control; the role of networking for the entrepreneur; and attitudes to the production of high quality food and drink. Phase 4 comprised interviews with 40 consumers of local food, recruited at selected premises of phase 3 interviewees.

40|$|Given {{that there}} has been no single view of the causes of global {{environmental}} degradation in the face of Third World developmentalism and widespread poverty, this thesis explores the potentials of Muslim groups to advance <b>relocalisation,</b> or returning to smaller scale, more self-reliant communities with simpler ways of living and with self-local governance. In particular, the research investigates the role of an Islamic symbolic universe in the adherents' decisions to act, including how this affects interactions with the nation-state and modern sciences within the Indonesian context. In advancing this argument, I rely on social constructivism as it was developed by Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann, in conjunction with a Symbolic Interactionism premise, to develop a theoretical framework appropriate to Muslim communities and their voluntaristic actions. With a qualitative research method, the research focuses on four Indonesian Muslim groups: Muhammadiyah, Nahdlatul Ulama, Hidayatullah, An-Nadzir and the learning communities they established. Data sources include interviews with leaders, observations, participatory observations, documents, and texts. The outcome shows that capitalising on an Islamic symbolic universe to transition Muslim communities by endogenous <b>relocalisation</b> is possible and doable. Of the four Muslim organisations studied, all had potential for support of <b>relocalisation</b> in different ways, with Hidayatullah and An- Nadzir providing the closest example of green intentional communities which can be transformed into models of endogenous <b>relocalisation</b> by Muslim groups. The transformed models can be duplicated and their culture can be propagated, to convert Muslim society at large {{to live up to the}} Islamic ecological values for survival and sustainability. The thesis puts forward knowledge transmission by Murabbi as a way to make sustainability education relevant to Muslim societies, based on the understanding that one needs more than intellectual ability to comprehend knowledge, but rather time is needed to personalize it by living it. The thesis highlights epistemological pluralism as posing a serious challenge to the 'whole-earth-one-world- family' vision of the environmentalists. With that challenge in the background, it aims to offer a more realistic vision where at least one sector of humanity can possibly advance environmental movement on a global scale under its own 'sacred canopy', that is, a 'global network of <b>relocalisation</b> by local Muslim communities'. Thereby, the thesis advocates decentralism as opposed to centralism, and Dar al-Islam Environmental governance for the Ummah within 'night-watchman states'...|$|E

40|$|Poly(A) -binding protein 1 (PABP 1) has a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} regulation of mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial {{for a wide variety of}} cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with the exception of PABP 4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small number of cell types. We have found that PABP 4, similarly to PABP 1, is a diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However, UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear <b>relocalisation</b> of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP <b>relocalisation,</b> we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that block mRNA export recapitulate PABP <b>relocalisation.</b> Our results support a model in which nuclear export of PABPs is dependent on ongoing mRNA export, and that a block in this process following UV exposure leads to accumulation of cytoplasmic PABPs in the nucleus.

To {{gain insight into}} how cells manage UVC-induced stalled replication forks, we analysed the molecular crosstalk between the TLS DNA polymerases Polg and Rev 1, the double-strand break repair (DSB) -associated protein MDC 1 and the FANC pathway. We describe three novel functional interactions that occur in response to UVC-induced DNA lesions. First, Polg and Rev 1, whose optimal expression and/or <b>relocalisation</b> depend on the FANC core complex, act upstream of FANCD 2 and are required for the proper <b>relocalisation</b> of monoubiquitinylated FANCD 2 (Ub-FANCD 2) to subnuclear foci. Second, during S-phase, Ub-FANCD 2 and MDC 1 relocalise to UVC-damaged nuclear areas or foci simultaneously but independently of each other. Third, Ub-FANCD 2 and MDC 1 are independently required for optimal BRCA 1 <b>relocalisation.</b> While RPA 32 phosphorylation (p-RPA 32) and RPA foci formation were reduced in parallel with increasing levels of H 2 AX phosphorylation and MDC 1 foci in UVC-irradiated FANC pathway-depleted cells, MDC 1 depletion was associated with increased UVC-induced Ub-FANCD 2 and FANCD 2 foci as well as p-RPA 32 levels and p-RPA 32 foci.

However virus protein translation continues because the translational apparatus in HSV-infected cells is maintained in an active state.

This <b>relocalisation</b> occurred in a time-dependent manner with respect to virus infection. Since HSV- 1 infection causes cell stress, we examined other cell stress inducers and found that oxidative stress similarly relocated PABP 1.

Our method uses ideas from fast state-of-the-art binary descriptors combined with a Locality-Sensitive-Hashing technique to perform nearest-neighbour search {{as well as a}} 3 D validation and sampling strategy. Albeit appealing for speed and memory footprint reasons, binary descriptors lead to a weak discrimination response which produces several false positive matches. This results in having to invest longer in removing outliers to compute a valid pose than when using more expensive descriptors. To alleviate this problem we propose a geometric validation stage that assists in the selection of good sample matches and benefits from the depth information available in depth cameras such as RGB-D or stereo. Our experiments suggest the feasibility of our approach with a <b>relocalisation</b> performance of 73 % while running at 54 Hz.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a system which}} is able to track the pose of a hand-held camera as it moves around a scene. The system builds a 3 D map of point landmarks in the world while tracking the pose of the camera relative to this map using a process called simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM). To achieve real-time performance, the map must be kept sparse, but rather than observing only the mapped landmarks like previous systems, observations are made of features across the entire image. Their deviation from the predicted epipolar geometry is used to further constrain the estimated inter-frame motion and so improves the overall accuracy. The consistency of the estimation is also improved by performing the estimation in a camera-centred coordinate frame. As with any such system, tracking failure is inevitable due to occlusion or sudden motion of the camera. A <b>relocalisation</b> module is presented which monitors the SLAM system, detects tracking failure, and then resumes tracking {{as soon as the}} conditions have improved. This <b>relocalisation</b> process is achieved using a new landmark recognition algorithm which is trained on-line and provides high recall and a fast recognition time. The <b>relocalisation</b> module {{can also be used to}} achieve place recognition for a loop closure detection system. By taking into account both the geometry and appearance information when determining a loop closure this module is able to outperform previous loop closure detection techniques used in monocular SLAM. After recognising an overlap, the map is then corrected using a novel trajectory alignment technique that is able to cope with the inherent scale ambiguity in monocular SLAM. By incorporating all of these new techniques, the system presented can perform as a robust augmented reality system, or act as a navigation tool which could be used on a mobile robot in indoor and outdoor environments. </p...|$|E

We compare our algorithm to existing techniques for loop closure in single–camera SLAM based on both image– to–image and map–to–map correspondences and discuss both the reliability and suitability of each algorithm {{in the context of}} monocular SLAM.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} FairTrade is to {{influence}} world trade, {{and reduce the}} unfairness of exchanges. In this article we point out that {{so far it has}} done little to increase justice at the global and local levels. This is because it is increasingly adopting the logic of conventional trade. Nevertheless, paradoxically, it could help to improve things by promoting the <b>relocalisation</b> of exchanges between countries or regions that have the same level of development, a prospect that currently cannot be excluded.

40|$|AbstractCaspases, {{a family}} of {{specific}} proteases, have central roles in apoptosis [1]. Caspase activation in response to diverse apoptotic stimuli involves the <b>relocalisation</b> of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytoplasm where it stimulates the proteolytic processing of caspase precursors. Cytochrome c release is controlled {{by members of the}} Bcl- 2 family of apoptosis regulators [2, 3]. The anti-apoptotic members Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xL may also control caspase activation independently of cytochrome c <b>relocalisation</b> or may inhibit a positive feedback mechanism [4 – 7]. Here, we investigate the role of Bcl- 2 family proteins in the regulation of caspase activation using a model cell-free system. We found that Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xL set a threshold in the amount of cytochrome c required to activate caspases, even in soluble extracts lacking mitochondria. Addition of dATP (which stimulates the procaspase-processing factor Apaf- 1 [8, 9]) overcame inhibition of caspase activation by Bcl- 2, but did not prevent the control of cytochrome c release from mitochondria by Bcl- 2. Cytochrome c release was accelerated by active caspase- 3 and this positive feedback was negatively regulated by Bcl- 2. These results provide evidence for a mechanism to amplify caspase activation that is suppressed at several distinct steps by Bcl- 2, even after cytochrome c is released from mitochondria...|$|E
40|$|Gap junctions, {{composed}} of connexins, allow direct intercellular communication. Gap junctions are often lost {{during the development}} of malignancy, although the processes behind this are not fully understood. Connexin 43 (Cx 43) is a widely expressed connexin with a long cytoplasmic C-terminal tail that contains several potential protein interaction domains. Previously, in a model of cervical carcinogenesis we showed loss of gap junctional communication correlated with <b>relocalisation</b> of Cx 43 to the cytoplasm late in tumourigenesis. Now we demonstrate a similar pattern of altered expression for the Discs Large (hDlg) MAGUK family tumour suppressor protein in the cervical tumour cells, with partial co-localisation of Cx 43 and hDlg in an endosomal/lysosomal compartment. <b>Relocalisation</b> of these proteins is not due to a general disruption of cell membrane integrity or connexin targeting. Cx 43 (via its C-terminus) and hDlg interact directly in vitro and can form a complex in cells. This novel interaction requires the N and C-termini of hDlg. hDlg is not required for Cx 43 internalisation in W 12 GPXY cells. Instead, hDlg {{appears to have a}} role in maintaining a cytoplasmic pool of Cx 43. These results demonstrate that hDlg is a physiologically relevant regulator of Cx 43 in transformed epithelial cells...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{real-time}} dense scene reconstruction from handheld RGBD cameras [1], one key aspect to enable robust operation {{is the ability to}} relocalise in a previously mapped environment or after loss of measurement. Tasks such as operating on a workspace, where moving objects and occlusions are likely, require a recovery competence in order to be useful. For RGBD cameras, this must also include the ability to relocalise in areas with reduced visual texture. View Sampling One key difference between our work and previous <b>relocalisation</b> systems is that, enabled by the recovered 3 D map, we can generate novel synthetic views that have not been visited by the system during mapping and that are considered likely poses where <b>relocalisation</b> will be needed. This enhances the power of the sampling used by the regression framework but introduces the issue of knowing which views should be generated. Contribution This work describes a view-based method for <b>relocalisation</b> of a freely moving RGBD camera in small workspaces. In contrast to related methods [2, 3], this method combines intensity and depth information from synthetic RGBD images to estimate full 6 D pose at framerate using a regression framework. Here we have adopted the approach of randomly sampling poses around a pre-defined trajectory. For each of the m sampled synthetic views, a pose on the trajectory is randomly selected and a random Gaussian perturbation with 10 ◦ and 5. 0 cm standard deviation is applied. Synthetic views are resampled if fewer than 50 % of the pixels intersect with the map. During the sampling process, the statistics for σc and σρ, required by the regression algorithm, are also calculated and stored. It is also trivial to extend the set of synthetic views online, for example if the camera is tracked into a new location, or if the map appearance changes due to movement of objects. Regression Method We treat the estimation of camera pose ˜x for input image I 0 as a general regression problem over a set of m synthetic views Ij and their poses xj, for j = 1 [...] . m. Using the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, ∑m j=...|$|E
