5|$|The Kerala red rain {{phenomenon}} was a {{blood rain}} event that occurred from 25 July to 23 September 2001, when heavy downpours of red-coloured rain fell sporadically {{on the southern}} Indian state of Kerala, staining clothes pink. Yellow, green, and black <b>rain</b> <b>was</b> also reported. Coloured <b>rain</b> <b>was</b> also reported in Kerala in 1896 and several times since, most recently in June 2012, and from 15 November 2012 to 27 December 2012 in eastern and north-central provinces of Sri Lanka.|$|E

5|$|Flower, Sun, and <b>Rain</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} by Grasshopper Manufacture. The game was conceived by studio founder Goichi Suda, beginning development in 1999 {{after completion of}} the studio's debut title The Silver Case. The staff number for The Silver Case was under ten people and thus they had to adjust their development goals based on that. For Flower, Sun, and Rain five or six more people were involved and thus the scope was increased, such as including exploration and action elements. According to Suda, Flower, Sun, and <b>Rain</b> <b>was</b> part of the studio's transition towards more action-oriented titles. While The Silver Case was published on the original PlayStation, that console was {{nearing the end of}} its viable life cycle, so Flower, Sun, and <b>Rain</b> <b>was</b> developed for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). Flower, Sun, and Rain moved away from the purely text-driven structure of The Silver Case, but it still carried over many of the previous game's themes and concepts. As with The Silver Case, Suda wanted to include puzzles, but felt that he had gone too far with the variety and challenge of puzzles within The Silver Case. Instead, Suda created a single puzzle system revolving around numerical combinations, which both simplified puzzles and tied in with Mondo's character.|$|E

40|$|By definition, steady rain {{should have}} a nearly {{constant}} rainfall rate. Thus far, however, the criteria for determining when <b>rain</b> <b>is</b> steady remain qualitative and arbitrary. The authors suggest a definition for steadiness {{that can be used}} to quantify the elusive notion of natural variability. In particular, the logical criteria for steadiness imply statistical stationarity and lack of correlation between raindrops in neighboring volumes, requirements identical to those for the drops being distributed according to a Poisson process at all scales. Hence, steady <b>rain</b> <b>is</b> Poissonian. Explicit equations for the variance of the rainfall rates are developed. They show that, in 2 sR general, raindrop clustering enhances the variance beyond that for Poissonian <b>rain</b> (). It <b>is</b> also demonstrated 2 sP by using observations that this enhancement is augmented further when the <b>rain</b> <b>is</b> statistically nonstationary. Identifying steady <b>rain</b> <b>is</b> important. To be specific, because steady <b>rain</b> <b>is</b> statistically stationary, the drop size distributions have physical, deterministic meanings independent of the measurement process. Observables such as the radar reflectivity factor and the rainfall rate are then steady and linearly related also. Techniques for determining when <b>rain</b> <b>is</b> steady are discussed. The ratio / is proposed as a useful quantitative measure of 2 2 s sR P the steadiness of the <b>rain.</b> It <b>is</b> also shown that an estimate of the minimum possible standard deviation for steady <b>rain</b> <b>is</b> / where and <b>are</b> the mean <b>rain</b> rate and average number of drops per sample, respectively.

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed in the Bay of Bengal passed over the southern Indian subcontinent and developed into a depression in the Arabian Sea off the southern Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not develop as it drifted west, and it degenerated into an area of {{low pressure}} as it was approaching the Arabian Peninsula. The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar.
