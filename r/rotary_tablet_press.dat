Conventional {{techniques for}} measuring flowability do not normally provide {{information that is}} directly relevant {{to the design of}} powder feed systems or to the selection of press parameters for the die filling process. Sinka et al. [I. C. Sinka, L. C. R. Schneider, A. C. F. Cocks, Measurement of the flow properties of powders with special reference to die fill, in: International Journal of Pharmaceutics 280 (1 - 2) (2004) 27 - 38] used an experimental shoe-die system to characterise the flow behaviour of pharmaceutical powders. A rigorous data analysis procedure was developed by Schneider et al. [L. C. R. Schneider, I. C. Sinka, A. C. F. Cocks, Characterisation of the flow behaviour of pharmaceutical powders using a model die-shoe filling system, in: Powder Technology (in press) ] to evaluate the experimental results, however, when scaling the results to a <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>press,</b> the die fill efficiency was underpredicted by a factor of approximately 2, because the experimental system did not capture major features of the rotary press flow process. The suction effect, whereby the lower punch is moved downwards while the top of the die is exposed to powder in the feed system, is a key element of the process. In this note we describe the development of a model shoe-die system that allows the effect of suction to be investigated. The results demonstrate the improvement offered by suction and illustrate how a fundamental understanding of die fill phenomena could assist the selection of process parameters to maximise the operational speed of a rotary press. 1106...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{densification}} of powder mixtures on eccentric and <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>presses</b> and to establish relationships with the halving properties of the resulting scored tablets. This is an important problem because the recent guidelines of EU require verification of the equal masses of tablet halves. The models of Walker, Heckel, and Kawakita were used to describe the powder densification on the two machines. The calculated parameters revealed that the shorter compression cycle of rotary machines results in poorer densification and lower tablet hardness at a given compression force. This is manifested in poorer halving properties, which are influenced mainly by the hardness. Better densification improves the halving even at lower tablet hardness. This demonstrates that these parameters can be good predictors of tablet halving properties...|$|R

40|$|The effect, {{of varying}} the {{proportion}} of binder starch paste (SP) and the disintegrant sodium starch glycolate (SSG), on the compaction behavior of wet granulated acetaminophen (ACM) formulations using a fully instrumented <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>press,</b> was studied. Wet granulation formulations were prepared using ACM, SP as binder (equal to 2. 5 %, 5 % or 10 % starch concentration), SSG as disintegrant (0 %, 4 %, 8 %, or 12 % w/w), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and magnesium stearate (MS) (1. 5 % w/w). Upper and lower punch force displacement data during in-die compaction was captured using a fully instrumented <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> at 13. 8 rpm at 96 ± 8, 163 ± 13, 235 ± 12 MPa compaction pressures. Elastic energy [EE] and tablet tensile strength was determined {{as a function of}} starch and SSG concentration and compaction pressure. At a given compaction pressure, increasing {{the proportion of}} SSG resulted in higher values of elastic energy (0. 28 to 0. 76 Nm with increase in SSG from 0 % to 12 % at 5 % starch and 235 ± 12 MPa compaction pressures). The negative effect of SSG on the overall compressibility of granules was due to its high elastic energy anddecrease in interparticulate bonding. When examining the elastic energy at increasing SP levels, a decrease in elastic energy was evident (0. 60, 0. 50 and 0. 31 Nm for 2. 5 %, 5 % and 10 % starch at 4 % SSG and 235 ± 12 MPa compaction pressures respectively). At a given composition, an increase in compaction pressure led to an increase in elastic energy (0. 15, 0. 33 and 0. 50 Nm at 4 % SSG and 5 % starch for 96 ± 8, 163 ± 13, 235 ± 12 MPa compaction pressures, respectively). When changing SSG and binder (SP) concentration levels tensile strength was indirectly proportional to elastic energy during compaction. Negative influence of SSG on elastic energy indicated by increased EE and decreased tensile strength and positive influence of SP was evident onlower elastic energy and higher tensile strength of tablets...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to apply response surface approach to investigate main and interaction effects of formulation parameters in optimizing novel fast disintegrating tablet formulation using β cyclodextrin as a diluent. The variables studied were diluent (β cyclodextrin, X 1), superdisintegrant (Croscarmellose sodium, X 2), and direct compression aid (Spray dried lactose, X 3). Tablets were prepared by direct compression method on B 2 <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> using flat plain-face punches and characterized for weight variation, thickness, disintegration time (Y 1), and hardness (Y 2). Disintegration time was strongly affected by quadratic terms of β cyclodextrin, croscarmellose sodium, and spray-dried lactose. The positive value of regression coefficient for β cyclodextrin suggested that hardness increased with increased amount of β cyclodextrin. In general, disintegration of tablets {{has been reported to}} slow down with increase in hardness. However in the present study, higher concentration of β cyclodextrin was found to improve tablet hardness without increasing the disintegration time. Thus, β cyclodextrin is proposed as a suitable diluent to achieve fast disintegrating tablets with sufficient hardness.

The excipient levels investigated were Level 2 changes in component and composition described in the Scale-Up and Post Approval Changes for Immediate Release (SUPAC–IR) guidance (1).

40|$|The {{influence}} of the lubricant magnesium stearate (MgSt) on the powder and tablet properties of chitin-Mg silicate coprecipitate was examined and compared with lubricated Avicel (R) 200 and Avicel-Mg silicate coprecipitate. Crushing strength and disintegration time studies were conducted in order to evaluate tablet properties at different compression pressures. Lubrication of chitin-Mg silicate powder with MgSt was evaluated using a high speed <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>press.</b> The compactability and disintegration time of chitin-Mg silicate are unaffected by the possible deleterious action of up to 2 % (w/w) MgSt. The deleterious effect of MgSt on Avicel (R) 200 compaction {{was found to be}} minimized when magnesium silicate was coprecipitated onto Avicel (R) 200. Lubrication of chitin-Mg silicate with MgSt does not enhance particle agglomeration, whereas the opposite is the case for Avicel (R) 200; the foregoing was ascertained by measurements of the fixed bulk density, constant powder porosity using Kawakita analysis and by the absence of variation in particle size distribution in the presence of up to 5 % (w/w) MgSt. In the case of chitin-Mg silicate tablets the ejection force was greatly reduced at a compression speed of 150, 000 tablet/h at a MgSt concentration of 0. 5 % (w/w). The physical properties and drug dissolution profile of ibuprofen tablets were found to be unaffected when chitin-Mg silicate was lubricated up to 5 % (w/w) with MgSt. Optimal drug dissolution was attained for gemfibrozil tablets using 3 % (w/w) MgSt when compared to a reference (Lopid tablets) ...|$|E

Water acted as a good medium for mannitol as well as a bridging liquid for agglomeration of mannitol with cellulose. The agglomerates were evaluated for percentage fines and carr’s index. Tablets were prepared on a <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>press,</b> and they were evaluated for friability, tensile strength, water absorption ratio, and disintegration time. Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to evolve full and reduce models. The use of composite index was demonstrated for the selection of an appropriate batch.

Knowledge and understanding of the influence of these parameters on the final product quality is of great importance for the industry, allowing economic efficiency and parametric release. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of paddle speeds and fill depth at different tableting speeds on the weight and weight variability of tablets. Materials and methods: Two excipients possessing different flow behavior, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate (DCP), were selected as model powders. Tablets were manufactured via a high-speed <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> using design of experiments (DoE). During each experiment also the volume of powder in the forced feeder was measured. Results and discussion: Analysis of the DoE revealed that paddle speeds are of minor importance for tablet weight but significantly affect volume of powder inside the feeder in case of powders with excellent flowability (DCP). The opposite effect of paddle speed was observed for fairly flowing powders (MCC). Tableting speed played a role in weight and weight variability, whereas changing fill depth exclusively influenced tablet weight. Conclusion: The DoE approach allowed predicting the optimum combination of process parameters leading to minimum tablet weight variability. Monte Carlo simulations allowed assessing the probability to exceed the acceptable response limits if factor settings were varied around their optimum.

Particle size distribution was fixed between 0. 250 and 0. 850  mm. Tablets did not evidence any mechanical failures, such as lamination or capping, or anomalous weight variation in either tablet machine types. Upper and lower tablet surface photomicrographs from ETM and RTM tablets showed differences in porosity and texture. Different RTM speeds suggested the visco-plastic behavior of the formulation, since, by slowing down rotation speeds, the tensile strength of the tablets increased significantly, but the porosity and disintegration time were not affected. Tablets produced in RTM showed lower friability and porosity than ETM tablets, which did not reflect on higher tensile strength. The EXCG distribution at upper and lower surfaces from ETM and RTM tablets was quantified by image analysis and evaluated through statistical methods.

The packing index (PI), frictional index (FI), and packing energy (PE) derived from the force-displacement profiles showed that MS sample I performed better than sample II. At higher lubricant mixing times, the values of PI were observed to increase, and values of FI and PE were observed to decrease for both MS samples. Lower values of area under the curve (AUC) calculated from force-time compression profiles also showed sample I to be superior to sample II in lubrication potential. For both the samples, the values of AUC were observed to decrease with higher lubricant mixing times. Tapping volumetry that simulates the initial particle rear-rangement gave values of parameter a and Cmax that were higher for sample I than sample II and also increased with lubricant mixing time. The superior lubrication potential of sample I was also established by the lower values of peak ejection force encountered in the ejection profile. Lower ejection forces were also found to result from higher tableting speeds and longer lubricant mixing times. The difference in lubrication efficacy of the 2 samples could be attributed to differences in their solid-state properties, such as particle size, specific surface area, and d-spacing...|$|E
40|$|Tablets of {{different}} composition of microcrystalline cellulose/a-monohydrate lactose and fixed drug (Acetaminophen) concentration are compressed in a <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> replicator at different compaction forces. Tablets are formulated {{to act as}} immediate release (IR) drug delivery system. Performance of IR tablets is usually controlled by the dynamics of solvent penetration into the tablet through competing mechanisms: capillarity, diffusion, and swelling/diffusion sometimes called case 2 diffusion, inducing matrix swelling. We design a device to measure tablet deformation dynamics and mass of liquid uptake simultaneously when a tablet is put in contact with a liquid through its bottom surface. On the other hand, dissolution profiles are measured in a standard USP II apparatus. Dissolution profiles present a nonmonotonic behavior with compression: the active dissolves relatively slowly when tablets are compressed below a certain threshold. Above the threshold, the dissolution rate decreases as expected due to decrease in porosity. Swelling and water uptake rates present the same nonmonotonic behavior with compression than dissolution profiles, indicating a very good correlation between them. This implies that the methodology may be used {{not only as a}} research tool and for quality by design development of tablets, but also for fast assessments in quality control environment. We finally demonstrate that a different mechanism for water penetration in the tablet is in place for differently compressed tablets: interparticle pore capillarity and swelling assisted uptake, respectively. We decoupled the two mechanisms by comparing dynamics of water versus a nonswelling liquid uptake. We postulate that the different mechanism for water uptake is responsible for the nonmonotonic behavior and the optimum dissolution rate...|$|E

40|$|The {{introductory}} {{chapter of}} this doctoral thesis {{provides an overview}} of the salient properties of pharmaceutical excipients, chitin, metal silicates and sugar alcohols in order to give a scientific background/context to the research subject matter reported in subsequent chapter of the thesis. When chitin is used in pharmaceutical formulations processing of chitin with metal silicates is advantageous, from both an industrial and pharmaceutical perspective, compared to processing using silicon dioxide. Unlike the use of acidic and basic reagents for the industrial preparation of chitin-silica particles, co-precipitation of metal silicates is dependent upon a simple replacement reaction between sodium silicate and metal chlorides. When co-precipitated onto chitin particles, aluminum, magnesium, or calcium silicates result in non-hygroscopic, highly compactable, and disintegrable compacts. Disintegration and hardness parameters for co-processed chitin compacts were investigated and found to be independent of the particle size. Capillary action appears to be the major contributor to both water uptake and the driving force for disintegration of compacts. The good compaction and compression properties exhibited by the chitin–metal silicates were found to be strongly dependent upon the type of metal silicate co-precipitated onto chitin. In addition, the inherent binding and disintegration abilities of chitin–metal silicates are useful in pharmaceutical applications when poorly compressible and/or highly non-polar drugs need to be formulated. The influence of the lubricant magnesium stearate (MgSt) on the powder and tablet properties of chitin-Mg silicate co-precipitate was examined and compared with lubricated Avicel® 200 and Avicel-Mg silicate co-precipitate.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the utility of near {{infrared}} (NIR) spectroscopy for the determination of content uniformity, tablet crushing strength (tablet hardness), and dissolution rate in sulfamethazine veterinary bolus dosage forms. A formulation containing sulfamethazine, corn starch, and magnesium stearate was employed. The formulations were wet granulated with a 10 % (wt/vol) starch paste in a high shear granulator and dried at 60 °C in a convection tray dryer. The tablets were compressed on a Stokes B 2 <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> running at 30 rpm. Each sample was scanned in reflectance mode in the wavelengths of the NIR region. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the NIR tablet spectra and the neat raw materials indicated that the scores of the first 2 principal components were highly correlated with the chemical and physical attributes. Based on the PCA model, the significant wavelengths for sulfamethazine are 1514, (1660 – 1694), 2000, 2050, 2150, 2175, 2225, and 2275 nm; for corn starch are 1974, 2100, and 2325 nm; and for magnesium stearate are 2325 and 2375 nm. In addition, the loadings show large negative peaks around the water band regions (≈ 1420 and 1940 nm), indicating that the partial least squares (PLS) models could be affected by product water content. A simple linear regression model was able to predict content uniformity with a correlation coefficient of 0. 986 at 1656 nm; the use of a PLS regression model, with 3 factors, had anr 2 of 0. 9496 and a sandard error of calibration of 0. 0316.

40|$|Purpose To {{determine}} the processability of formulations containing Carbopol® 971 P NF polymer via roller compaction {{and study the}} influence of formulation and process variables on the properties of granules and tablets. Methods Two theophylline (50 % w/w) formulations containing Carbopol® 971 P NF polymer (10 or 20 % w/w) and one guaifenesin (25 % w/w) formulation containing Carbopol® 971 P NF polymer (10 % w/w) were dry-granulated at varying process parameters i. e. roll speed (6 - 12 rpm) and roll pressure (80 - 100 bars). The granules were blended with lubricant and compressed into tablets (800 mg) on a <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>press.</b> The granules were evaluated for density, particle size and flow characteristics. The tablets were evaluated for weight variation, breaking force, friability and dissolution properties. Reproducibility {{studies were carried out}} to ascertain the robustness of the formulations. Results Successful tablet formulations were prepared using theophylline as a model drug, Carbopol® 971 P NF polymer (10 % and 20 % w/w) as a release rate-controlling matrix former via roller compaction. At both polymer levels, the tablets showed acceptable weight, thickness, breaking force and friability values across the process variables tested. The release of theophylline was inversely proportional to the incorporated polymer level i. e. for formulations containing 10 % w/w Carbopol® 971 P NF polymer complete dissolution was observed after 16 hours while for formulations containing 20 % w/w Carbopol® 971 P NF polymer complete dissolution was observed after 24 hours. The roller-compaction parameters studied did not appear to have a significant influence on the dissolution performance of the tablets. Guaifenesin tablets containing 10 % w/w Carbopol® 971 P NF polymer showed consistent and acceptable weight, thickness, breaking force and friability across the process parameters evaluated. The drug release showed low intra-batch variability and complete dissolution was observed after 16 hours. The overall performance of the tablets was found to be reproducible at all the roller compaction process parameters evaluated. Conclusion Theophylline formulations containing Carbopol® 971 P NF polymer (10 or 20 % w/w) and guaifenesin formulation containing Carbopol® 971 P NF polymer (10 % w/w) could be successfully processed by roller-compaction for preparing extended-release matrix tablets...|$|E
40|$|Combination {{therapy has}} various {{advantages}} over monotherapy. In the last decade, {{interest in developing}} a combination {{of two or more}} Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) in a single dosage form (monolithic or bilayer tablet) has increased in the pharmaceutical industry, promoting patient convenience and compliance. Bilayer tablets can be a primary option to avoid chemical incompatibilities between API by physical separation, and to enable the development of different drug release profiles (immediate release with extended release). Several pharmaceutical companies are currently developing bi-layer tablets, for a variety of reasons: patent extension, therapeutic, marketing to name a few. To reduce capital investment, quite often existing but modified <b>tablet</b> <b>presses</b> are used to develop and produce such tablets. This article explains why the development and production of quality bi-layer tablets needs to be carried out on purpose-built <b>tablet</b> <b>presses</b> to overcome common bi-layer problems, such as layer-separation, insufficient hardness, inaccurate individual layer weight control, cross-contamination between the layers, reduced yield etc. Using a modified <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> may therefore not be best approach in producing a quality bi-layer tablet under GMP conditions, especially when high production output is required. There are various applications of the bi-layer tablet consists of monolithic partially coated or multilayered matrices...|$|R

We proposed plotting “Compactability” on the x-axis against “Manufacturability” on the y-axis to allow visual evaluation of “Tableting properties”. Various types of tableting failure occur in commercial drug production and {{are influenced by the}} amount of lubricant used and the shape of the punch. We used the GTP- 1 to measure “Tableting properties” with different amounts of lubricant and compared the results with those of tableting on a commercial <b>rotary</b> tableting machine. <b>Tablets</b> compressed {{with a small amount of}} lubricant showed bad “Manufacturability”, leading to sticking of powder on punches. We also tested various punch shapes. The GTP- 1 correctly predicted the actual tableting results for all punch shapes. With punches that were more likely to cause tableting failure, our system predicted the effects of lubricant quantity in the tablet formulation and the occurrence of sticking in the rotary tableting machine...|$|R

40|$|After {{completion}} of the studies using the PressterTM {{it can be concluded}} that comparative results between PressterTM and rotary tablet presses can be achieved if the compression parameters are correctly set up. Firstly manufacturing of tablets with the same mass is important for the comparison. In addition the studies revealed that tablets need to have the same thickness because otherwise they were differently densified. Thickness is often specified for packaging of tablets being an important parameter for this reason. To achieve the same thickness the same band height needs to be set up on both tableting machines. The PressterTM offers the possibility to measure punch displacement to find out the actual punch gap. If tablet presses are not instrumented only the out-of-die thickness can be measured and the band height can be adjusted accordingly. The set up of two presses to the same compression force is not reliable because the compression force {{is a result of the}} tablet mass and the punch gap and therefore only an indirect parameter. Calibration of the strain gages is complicated and subject to failures e. g. with temperature changes. Recalibration of the PressterTM strain gages using Pfizer Freiburg calibration equipment revealed excellent results. When the experiments were performed using the same resulting compression force, the band height set up on PressterTM partly deviated significantly from the band height set up on a <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>press,</b> leading to differently densified tablets. If materials are compressed to the same thickness different compression forces are produced depending on material and/or batch variability. Thus the height of compression force indicates material properties and compression force variability points out differences in material properties. The experiments of this study confirm that precompression of the tablets is very important regarding the tablet properties. This is even more important if materials show a high tendency to elastic relaxation in order to prevent capping. PressterTM offers the instrumented die as a very useful tool to measure the radial die wall pressure. The mainly directly compressible formulations tested in this study were robust and compressible on PressterTM and rotary tablet presses without any issues. Only at extreme conditions: short dwell time, high main compression force and no precompression force capping occurred with a 90...|$|E
40|$|Efflux {{transporters}} such as ABCB 1 (P-gp) and ABCC 2 (MRP- 2) expressed on the apical membranes of {{epithelial cells}} of the intestine represent a formidable barrier for the effective delivery of a plethora of pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Excipients have attracted significant interest in their role as efflux protein inhibitors. To this end, {{the aim of this}} study was to examine the biological effects of commonly used excipients, and utilise this information in the design and manufacture of orally disintegrating tablets (ODT) using a design of experiments (DoE) approach. The ‘gold standard’ model of assessing intestinal efflux modulation remains the Caco- 2 Transwell® model. As this method is time and resource consuming, a novel high-throughput screening assay was developed to screen excipients for activity against the ABCB 1 and ABCC 2 transporters using the specific fluorescent probes rhodamine 123 (R- 123) and 5 (6) -carboxy- 2 ′, 7 ′-dichlorofluorescein (CDF) respectively. Of all the excipients screened, surfactants showed the highest efficacy against ABCB 1 with some materials showing lower IC 50 values than the established inhibitors verapamil (VER) and ciclosporin (CsA). One of the lead candidate excipients, poloxamer 407, was incorporated into a high-dose (795 mg) and a low-dose (295 mg) paracetamol (acetaminophen, APAP) formulation at 2 % (w/w). Whilst the development of the high-dose tablets was terminated with a disintegration time of 37 s, conforming to European Pharmacopeia specifications, the low-dose tablets were selected for manufacture using a <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>press.</b> These final formulations had disintegration times of 9 - 43 s over a range of compressions (6 - 23 kN), providing tablets that conform to both the European Pharmacopeia and United States Pharmacopeia. Taken with a 250 mL glass of water, these tablets are capable of delivering 5. 9 mg of poloxamer 407 to give a final concentration of 2. 36 x 10 - 3 % (w/v), 2. 7 times higher than the determined IC 50 value for this excipient. To investigate an additional method of incorporating surfactants into ODTs, granules containing ibuprofen were coated in a Kollicoat IR solution containing 2 % (w/v) PEG 2000, poloxamer 407 or Cremophor EL. The ODTs made from these granules by direct compression produced tablets with disintegration times below 30 seconds, showing the viability of this complementary method of propagating the surfactant content of oral dosage formulations...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the high}} {{quantities}} of tablets produced daily, {{a lot of}} the established processes and formulations are the results of (suboptimal) trial-and-error experiments, contributing to the image that the entire field of pharmaceutical powder technology is more “an art than a science” [1]. Also, a large number of contributing papers to the field date from roughly two or three decades ago. Although the operation mode and press lay-out stayed basically unchanged since its invention, the instrumentation improved largely in terms of quality, accuracy and sensitivity. Moreover, due to the increased competition through generic manufacturing and the shift towards a more patient-centered production, more advanced tablet formulations exhibiting e. g. prolonged, extended, delayed or immediate release profiles have emerged. This, together with the Process Analytical Technology (PAT) – initiative, proposed by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004, encourages a shift towards a more scientifically based technology. The goal of the initiative is to stimulate the pharmaceutical industry to “design and develop processes that can consistently ensure a predefined quality {{at the end of the}} manufacturing process”. By identifying all sources of variation of importance for the product performance and quality, and by increased process understanding and continuous monitoring, quality could be built rather than tested into the product [2]. Together with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Q 8 guideline on Pharmaceutical Development, focusing on the Quality-by-Design (QbD) concept, it forms the regulatory framework to catalyze the shift of the pharmaceutical industry towards a redesigning of the current approach [3 - 5]. Seen in the light of these new movements within the tablet manufacturing area, it appears obvious that there is a need for new knowledge to fund a base for a thorough understanding of the continuous tableting process. This thesis aims to contribute in this large context by the investigation of the tableting process on a high-speed <b>rotary</b> <b>tablet</b> <b>press.</b> The goal was to increase the understanding of the influence of the properties of the starting material and process parameters on dependent process parameters and tablet properties. Since the PAT-initiative stimulates the introduction of new analytical tools to enhance process understanding and product quality, additional analytical chemistry tools, next to the built-in instrumentation were used. Moreover, due to the large amount of data obtained, Design of Experiments (DoE) and Multivariate Data Analysis (MVA) were administered to perform experiments and analyze data in a structured manner. Three main topics were addressed: - The role of the forced feeder: its influence on the properties of the starting material, on the die-filling process and on the final tablet properties. - The mechanism of (double) compression: its influence on dependent process parameters and on the final tablet properties. - The role of additional analytical chemistry tools in a continuous tableting process: its applicability to asses tablet properties, produced from starting material with different characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- A <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> is a {{mechanical}} device that compresses powder into tablets of uniform size and weight. To form a tablet, the granulated material must be metered into a cavity formed by two punches and a die, {{and then the}} punches must be pressed together with great force to fuse the material together. A method of structure optimization for <b>tablet</b> <b>press</b> is proposed {{in order to reduce}} mass while assuring adequate stiffness. Pre compressor assembly, main compressor assembly, turret, plates are determined as optimal objects by mass analysis. Key geometric parameters of plates which have relatively larger impacts on mass and stiffness are extracted as design variables.
