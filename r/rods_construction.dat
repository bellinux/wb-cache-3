In studying of the dissipation of the internal energy in the materials the one of the complicated problems is the problem when the material is acting by a variable load.

If the dependence of the logarithmic decrement of the amplitude at the free vibrations, {{it can be used to}} calculate the resonant vibrations. When we solving problems for <b>rod</b> <b>constructions</b> the greatest interest has the spectrum of the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. It is proposed to use a two-node finite element in the case of plane bending vibrations of the rod. In this case, the nodal unknowns are deflections and turning angles the nodes. For the approximation of displacements we use a third-order polynomial. To find the spectrum eigenfrequencies and mode shapes is suggested to use a method of increasing stiffness, which is based on the minimization of functional of the Rayleigh type. The method coordinate wise descent is applied to solve the problem of minimizing the functional, which is one of the methods of nonlinear programming.

40|$|New and rehabilitated {{concrete}} structures need {{assessment of}} corrosion rate (CR) of rebars more precisely to ensure efficiency of protection against corrosion. For assessing the corrosion status, different sensors {{have been developed}} {{to reduce the risk of}} undetected corrosion problems. An embeddable CR-measuring sensor is embedded either closer to the <b>rod</b> during the <b>construction</b> of a new structure or in drilled holes in old structures so as to generate reliable data. In the present paper, the accuracy in predicting the corrosion current (Icorr) by embeddable sensor was assessed by comparing with other conventional electrode arrangements. Icorr was assessed under passive and active conditions of rebar. The presence of a cross bar and the effect of cover on Icorr were also studied. Using linear polarization resistance (LPR) technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) technique, the CR was determined and compared with the weight-loss method. Results concluded that by using electrochemical impedance technique, developed embeddable sensor is able to predict the CR very close to the CR determined from gravimetric method. The deviation from an ideal linear curve and the higher interfacial capacitance of steel in concrete caused the LPR method to underestimate the CR of rebar. The presence of the cross bar increases the Icorr of the main bar by 4 times in a passive state of the rebar and it has no effect if the rebar is in an active state. The embedded sensor, though having smaller counter electrode (CE), polarizes the rebar up to 2 times the length of CE under both active and passive states...|$|R

There will be great demand of the metal, for example, needed in the manufacture of machines, components and reinforcing <b>rods</b> for the <b>construction.</b> Though quite involving, steel is basically made by smelting iron ore charged with coke is a blast furnace. Kenya has ample iron ore deposits which are yet to be fully utilized for the development and economic growth of the nation. There are iron ore deposits in some counties like Taita Taveta (Manyatta), Tharaka (Marimanti) and Siaya (Samia) which have not been fully exploited. There is need to amass information on the quality of iron ore deposits and the method for pre-processing as a precursor to setting up a steel plant. The main focus in this paper is on the geology and geographical distribution of iron (Fe) ores and the ways of upgrading them so as to attain better grades to be used in furnaces. Iron ores have different metal (iron) composition ranging between 48 - 72 %, the remainder being impurities/gangue. Very low grade iron ore cannot be used in metallurgical plants and needs to be upgraded to increase the iron content and reduce the gangue. Iron ore is being beneficiated all round the world to meet the quality requirement of {{iron and steel}} plant. Use of iron and steel is increasing yearly as a result of upcoming projects all over the world. There are various methods/ways of beneficiating the ores but this paper is focused on two methods; magnetic separation and floatation methods.
