25|$|In 1974, a {{residency}} {{program was}} started by the Philippine General Hospital for aspiring physiatrists.

25|$|A {{rehabilitation}} team is usually multidisciplinary as it involves staff with different skills {{working together to}} help the patient. These include physicians trained in <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>medicine,</b> clinical pharmacists, nursing staff, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and orthotists. Some teams may also include psychologists and social workers, since at least one-third of affected people manifests post stroke depression.

500|$|In 1762 {{a surgeon}} named Andre Louis removed a bullet from the lumbar spine of a patient, who regained {{motion in the}} legs. In 1829 the surgeon Gilpin Smith {{performed}} a successful laminectomy that improved the patient's sensation. [...] However, the idea that SCI was untreatable remained predominant until the early 20th century. [...] In 1934, the mortality rate {{in the first two}} years after injury was over 80%, mostly due to infections of the urinary tract and pressure sores. It was not until the latter half of the century that breakthroughs in imaging, surgery, medical care, and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>medicine</b> contributed to a substantial improvement in SCI care. [...] The relative incidence of incomplete compared to complete injuries has improved since the mid-20th century, due mainly to the emphasis on faster and better initial care and stabilization of spinal cord injury patients. [...] The creation of emergency medical services to professionally transport people to the hospital is given partial credit for an improvement in outcomes since the 1970s. [...] Improvements in care have been accompanied by increased life expectancy of people with SCI; survival times have improved by about 2000% since 1940.|$|E

40|$|The {{replication}} {{of the human}} hand's functionality and appearance {{is one of the}} main reasons for the development of robot hands. Despite 40 years of research in the field [1], the reproduction of human capabilities, in terms of dexterous manipulation, still seems unachievable by the state-of-the-art technologies. From a design perspective, even defining the optimal functionalities of a robotic end-effector is quite a challenging task since possible applications of these devices span industrial robotics, humanoid robotics, <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>medicines,</b> and prosthetics, to name a few. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the design solutions, which are well suited to a single domain, might not be readily taken as general guidelines. For example, industrial manipulators are often equipped with basic grippers, which are conceived so as to increase the throughput and the reliability, and are assumed to operate in structured environments. In this case, the enhanced manipulation skills and the subsequent cost increases must be carefully motivated by the application requirements...|$|R
