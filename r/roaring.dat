5|$|On July 4, 1879, a {{group from}} Leadville struck gold in the {{uppermost}} <b>Roaring</b> Fork valley below the pass. Four miles (6.4km) to the west, they established a settlement in the upper <b>Roaring</b> Fork Valley that eventually took the name Independence from the holiday on which it was established. The pass, the lake from which the <b>Roaring</b> Fork rises and another nearby mountain all took that name as well. The Twin Lakes and <b>Roaring</b> Fork Toll Company, established to build a road through to the camps in the lower <b>Roaring</b> Fork Valley, improved the original path over the pass sufficiently enough by 1880 that horses {{could be used for}} the trip.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roaring</b> Brook then {{enters the}} Elmhurst Reservoir, where it briefly enters <b>Roaring</b> Brook Township before {{entering}} Elmhurst Township and receiving the tributary White Oak Run from the right. The stream continues flowing north-northwest, crossing Pennsylvania Route 435 and reentering <b>Roaring</b> Brook Township several tenths {{of a mile}} further downstream. It then crosses Interstate 84 and receives the tributary Rock Bottom Creek from the right as its valley becomes much deeper and narrower. It continues flowing north-northwest {{for more than a}} mile alongside Pennsylvania Route 435 before turning south-southwest and briefly entering Dunmore before reentering <b>Roaring</b> Brook Township. After several tenths of a mile, the stream turns northwest for a few miles, crossing Interstate 84 and reentering Dunmore. It passes through the Scranton Water Company Reservoir and receives the tributary Little <b>Roaring</b> Brook from the right before turning south and then west. It then turns northwest and crosses Interstate 81 before turning southwest and passing through the Nay Aug Gorge. The stream turns northwest for several tenths of a mile before turning west-southwest and crossing US Route 11. After a few tenths of a mile, it reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River.|$|E

5|$|<b>Roaring</b> Creek was {{historically}} {{known as}} Popemetang, {{but it was}} known as <b>Roaring</b> Creek by the late 1700s. Settlers such as Quakers first arrived {{in the area in}} the 1770s. In the 19th century, various mills and furnaces were constructed on the creek and several bridges were constructed. Agriculture was also a major industry in the watershed in the early 20th century. More bridges were constructed across the creek in the 20th century. The <b>Roaring</b> Creek Valley Conservation Association formed in February 2006. Part of the creek is navigable by canoe.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of alkalinity in <b>Roaring</b> Creek upstream of Lick Run is 9 milligrams per liter. Many nearby watersheds have been rendered nearly devoid of aquatic life due to acid mine drainage caused by coal mining. However, <b>Roaring</b> Creek {{has not been}} affected by this, {{although it has been}} still impacted by human land use. Sedimentation, siltation, and agricultural impacts occur in the watershed. The only impaired stream in the watershed is a small unnamed tributary that is impaired by siltation. From a chemical standpoint, <b>Roaring</b> Creek is infertile.|$|E

40|$|Red deer stags (Cervus elaphus) give two {{distinct}} types of <b>roars</b> during the breeding season, the “common roar” and the “harsh <b>roar.</b> ” Harsh <b>roars</b> are more frequent during contexts of intense competition, and {{characterized by a}} set of features that increase their perceptual salience, suggesting that they signal heightened arousal. While common <b>roars</b> have been shown to encode size information and mediate both male competition and female choice, to our knowledge, the specific function of harsh <b>roars</b> during male competition has not yet been studied. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that the specific structure of male harsh <b>roars</b> signals high arousal to competitors. We contrast the behavioral responses of free ranging, harem-holding stags to the playback of harsh <b>roars</b> from an unfamiliar competitor with their response to the playback of common <b>roars</b> from the same animal. We show that males react less strongly to sequences of harsh <b>roars</b> than to sequences of common <b>roars,</b> possibly because they are reluctant to escalate conflicts with highly motivated and threatening unfamiliar males in the absence of visual information. While future work should investigate the response of stags to harsh <b>roars</b> from familiar opponents, our observations remain consistent with the hypothesis that harsh <b>roars</b> may signal motivation during male competition, and illustrate how intrasexual selection can contribute to the diversification of male vocal signals...|$|R

5|$|Hardwood {{trees and}} hemlocks {{occur on the}} slopes of the valley of <b>Roaring</b> Creek. Hemlocks also occur in the creek's gorge. The canopy {{coverage}} at four sites on the creek ranges from 0 percent to 75 percent. The algal biomass of the creek ranges from 0.01 to 1.21 in terms of chlorophyll a per square centimeter. The <b>Roaring</b> Creek Bluffs are listed on the Columbia County Natural Areas Inventory. Jeweled shooting-star, which is threatened in Pennsylvania, occurs at this site. Other plant species in this area include hydrangea, fragile fern, maidenhair spleenwort, golden saxifrage. However, several weedy plants also grow in the area.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roaring</b> Brook is {{designated}} as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for part of its length and a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for {{the other part of}} its length.

Numerous macroinvertebrate taxa have been observed in the stream and boreal forest trees inhabit wetlands in the watershed.

5|$|<b>Roaring</b> Creek {{is located}} in the ridge and valley physiographic province. A {{dividing}} ridge separates the creek from the Susquehanna River. One reach of the creek is a mid-sized coldwater stream. Another reach is a large freestone stream. <b>Roaring</b> Creek flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale. Rocks in the watershed include claystones, conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, and shales from the Devonian and Mississippian. Outcroppings of calcareous beds, limestones, and marine fossils occur in the watershed as well. Some mineable coal is present in the watershed of South Branch <b>Roaring</b> Creek. The Genesee beds appear along the creek and are the lowest beds that are visible above the water line. To the east, they are covered by Chemung beds. A soil known as the Albrights Series is found along the creek. It is a reddish-brown soil that is slightly poorly or moderately well drained and is made from glaciated red shale and sandstone.|$|E

40|$|Red deer stags give {{two types}} of <b>roars</b> during the {{breeding}} season, termed ‘common’ and ‘harsh’ <b>roars.</b> This study tested {{the hypothesis that the}} characteristic spectro-temporal structure of male harsh <b>roars</b> functions to directly attract females towards male callers during the breeding season. The results show that oestrous hinds look for longer towards speakers broadcasting sequences containing harsh <b>roars,</b> but do not preferentially approach or spend more time in close proximity to speakers broadcasting harsh <b>roars</b> over those broadcasting only common <b>roars.</b> While these observations confirm that the specific acoustic structure of male harsh <b>roars</b> functions to draw the attention of hinds, they are not consistent with the notion that these calls have an immediate impact on mate choice decisions by stimulating oestrous hinds to move towards male callers. Consequently, we suggest that intersexual selection through female mate choice is unlikely to be a major factor driving the evolution of male red deer harsh <b>roars...</b>|$|R
