50|$|A {{temper mill}} is a steel sheet or steel plate {{processing}} line {{composed of a}} horizontal pass cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> <b>stand,</b> entry and exit conveyor tables and upstream and downstream equipment depending on the design {{and nature of the}} processing system.|$|E
50|$|The {{heart of}} the temper mill is the cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> <b>stand</b> which {{produces}} the temper pass. It will include electric powered drive motors and speed reduction gearing suited to the process desired. The design of the rolling mill can be a 2-high or 4-high (even 6-high in some cases). The mill stand can be work roll driven or back up roll driven. The mill can be designed with hydraulic work roll bending or back up roll bending. Installations typically have a single <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> <b>stand,</b> but may have two. Pinch rolls provide back tension for the pay off reel in the entry section and entry and exit tension for the temper pass.|$|E
40|$|The ‘Systems Engineering' is {{currently}} applied {{to face the}} complexity of products overall their life cycle. Some diagrams are used to preliminarily define the system behaviour, without resorting to numerical equations, which are used within the modelling tools usually applied by engineering sciences, only once that an assessment of architecture is performed. In case of mechatronic systems identifying the real contents of their ‘smartness' is rather difficult. Specific standards are very seldom available. An effective design should identify the smallest number of active functions required to greatly improve the system efficiency and to simplify its architecture, with the lowest need of power. The ‘Systems Engineering' enhances the detection of smartness requirements being related to the customer needs. As an example a review of requirements of a controlled rotor upon magnetic suspension used as a coiler to shape the steel rod {{at the end of}} the <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> <b>stand</b> is herein proposed. Critical issues for smartness are identified by means of behavioural diagrams of the ‘Systems Engineering', thus allowing an increase of MTBF (mean time between failures), with a beneficial reduction of stops in servic...|$|E

50|$|By 1798 {{tinplate}} production {{began in}} Lydbrook through {{the agency of}} the Partridge and Allaway families (Thomas Allaway was a tenant of the Patridges). The Upper and Lower Forges had been converted to tinplate works by the Partridges and then were leased by Allaway in 1817. It has been argued that tinplate production began in Lydbrook in 1760, which would have made it the earliest centre for tinplate production. The Allaways firm became 'Pearce & Allaway' in 1820, and then in 1850 'Allaways, Partridge & Co'. In 1871 the business was leased to Richard Thomas who moved into the village and lived at the Poplars, Upper Lydbrook. Thomas expanded his business taking over Lydbrook Colliery and Waterloo Colliery. Richard Thomas died in 1916. The works were closed during the First World War and ceased operating in 1925.

The main principles of this testing are described in the standard GOST 30415 - 96 “The steel. The NDT of mechanical properties and microstructure of steel articles by magnetic technique”. The method is widely applied so it is completely presented in special literature. The present work describes the method application in iron and steel industry, particularly in a roll state testing. The following tasks are fulfilled by means of testing of structural stressed state of a roll barrel surface layers: 1. Accomplishment of incoming control of a roll structural stressed state before its service life starting. Incoming control makes it possible to reveal a roll residual stress caused by a supplier’s methodical violations. 2. Diagnosis of abnormal areas in a roll barrel working layer which appeared due to the roll damage in the run of operation. 3. Determination of the optimal depth of re-grinding which guarantees removal of layers with intolerable level of accumulated residual stress. Calculation of residual resource of each roll that allows to define optimal amount of roll inventory. Diagnostics of preparation and installation defects of rolls in the <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> <b>stands.</b> Optimal stress redistribution in multi-stand mills. Magnetic monitoring makes it possible to reduce roll consumption per a tonne of rolled products, to increase a roll service life and to improve geometric characteristics of rolled products...|$|R

50|$|No6 Mill was a three-high <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> {{with several}} <b>stands</b> (Sets of Rolls) {{producing}} bar down to thick wire sizes from red hot billets {{taken from the}} reheat furnaces. The small diameter rod and bar produced in this mill snaked all over the cast iron floor plates. The operators used tongs to catch hold {{of the end of}} the red hot bar as it left the rolls, passed the bar around their body allowing it to loop out onto the floor and then entered the bar into the next pass position. In one hot summer the floor plates expanded, the expansion could not go anywhere and two plates buckled upwards like flagstones directing the hot metal into the air - within milliseconds there was no one on the mill floor as the metal reared up towards the roof and collapsed in a writhing heap as the mill rollers continued to spew out the rest of the bar.|$|R

To stabilize the motor torque the electric drive system with {{the properties of the}} rolling motor torque supply may also be used.

Rolling is widely used forming process, which can have high production figures and precise control of final product. Rolling is classified in two major parts the cold rolling and hot rolling. Every part has its own theory, development of rolling process and subsequently the designing of the cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> components, like rolls and <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing. The aim of the present paper is to understand the various methodologies which are used to design the cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> We {{have focused on the}} history of the rolling process; it is understand that the rolling process was adopted since year 1590. Although it was raw method but it initiated the slitting <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> and the actual experimentation were started from year 1670. In those days rolling was concerned with rolling of bars only after few years the rolling of bars were started. We also tried to discuss the earlier patents which were granted in 18 th century and was related to the tandem mill which were using copper and brass as the rolling materials. In year 1783, after the entry of grooved rolls the rolling production increased up to 15 times and that was the start of modern <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> While reviewing the design of <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> components our area of interest is to visit design of rollers and <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing.
