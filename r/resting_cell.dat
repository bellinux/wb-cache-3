50|$|This has {{a direct}} effect on the {{peripheral}} nervous system (PNS). Batrachotoxin in the PNS produces increased permeability (selective and irreversible) of the <b>resting</b> <b>cell</b> membrane to sodium ions, without changing potassium or calcium concentration. This influx of sodium depolarizes the formerly polarized cell membrane. Batrachotoxin also alters the ion selectivity of the ion channel by increasing the permeability of the channel toward larger cations. Voltage-sensitive sodium channels become persistently active at the resting membrane potential. Batrachotoxin kills by permanently blocking nerve signal transmission to the muscles.|$|E

5000|$|There is a {{significant}} difference between the concentrations of sodium and potassium ions inside and outside the cell. The concentration of sodium ions is considerably higher in the extracellular fluid than in the intracellular fluid. The converse is true of the potassium ion concentrations inside and outside the cell. These differences cause the cell membranes of all the living cells in the body to be electrically charged, with the positive charge on the outside of the cells and the negative charge on the inside. The electrical potential difference between the two is about 70 mV in a <b>resting</b> <b>cell.</b> This potential difference is created by ionic pumps in the membranes of cells, which pump sodium ions out of the cells, into the ECF, in return for potassium ions which enter the cell from the ECF. In several cell types special ion channels in the cell membrane can be temporarily opened under specific circumstances for a few microseconds at a time. This allows a brief inflow of sodium ions into the cell (driven in by the sodium ion concentration gradient that exists between the outside and inside of the cell). This causes the cell membrane to temporarily depolarize (i.e. lose its electrical charge) forming the basis of ‘’nerve impulses” (also known as action potentials). These action potentials are important means of communication along nerve fibers as well as along muscle fibres, both in the heart and skeletal muscle, and in several other tissues. These events can only occur if the concentrations of sodium and potassium ions in the ECF are at their correct (regulated) values.|$|E

In the model, the cell deactivation rate was proposed by a first order equation with different constants for step one and step two of series reactions. The biotransformation process was satisfactorily simulated by the kinetic model proposed.

But the growth tended to decrease aud the cells became to be die fairly early stage with time of cultnre. This was snpposedly due to the deorease of pH of media resulting from oxidation of glucose. 2) On the growing cells pyruvate and lactate were accumulated in fairly large amount as metabolite of glucose. A large amount of accumulated metabolite was also found on organism cultured by shaking. 3) Further oxidation of glucose beyond pyruvate was carried out more smoothly on the <b>resting</b> <b>cells</b> of shaking cultured organism than on the <b>resting</b> <b>cells</b> of still-standing cultured organism.

Also no inactivestion was found on the cell shaken as above and washed with glucose added buffer.
