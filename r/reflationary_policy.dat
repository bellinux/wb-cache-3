40|$|The model {{features}} the usual IS and LM curves and a dynamic equation {{for changes in}} the government's budget deficit. The price level is assumed to be prefectly flexible so that the goods market always clears, whereas trade unions {{play an important role in}} wage determination. Two union models are considered, the monopoly union and the efficient bargain model. With such explicit recognition of union behavior, the way conventional policies operate is changed with differing outcome. Since there is full price flexibility and the goverment deficit disappears, the effectiveness of <b>reflationary</b> <b>policies</b> is not subject to the usual criticisms. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of {{unemployment}} in sterling’s inter-war experience. According to most narrative accounts, the proximate cause of the 1931 sterling crisis was a high and rising unemployment rate that placed pressure on British governments to pursue <b>reflationary</b> <b>policies.</b> We present a model which, {{in the spirit of}} the ‘second generation’ approach to currency crises, highlights the conflict between the objective of low unemployment and defence of the currency and show that it can reproduce the main features of sterling’s inter-war experience. Econometric evidence lends further support to the view that the proximate cause of the sterling crisis was the dramatic rise in unemployment caused by external deflationary forces.

25|$|There is no {{consensus}} among economists regarding the motive force for the U.S. economic expansion that continued {{through most of the}} Roosevelt years (and the 1937 recession that interrupted it). The common view among most economists is that Roosevelt's New Deal policies either caused or accelerated the recovery, although his policies were never aggressive enough to bring the economy completely out of recession. Some economists have also called attention to the positive effects from expectations of reflation and rising nominal interest rates that Roosevelt's words and actions portended. It was the rollback of those same <b>reflationary</b> <b>policies</b> that led to the interrupting recession of 1937. One contributing policy that reversed reflation was the Banking Act of 1935, which effectively raised reserve requirements, causing a monetary contraction that helped to thwart the recovery. GDP returned to its upward trend in 1938.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the wake}} of the 2007 / 08 {{financial}} crisis, massive public interventions in markets that sought to mitigate the subsequent depression have resulted in huge deficits without being able to calm down the nervousness of markets and the rise of unemployment. A counterproductive dilemma then came into the picture through the opposition between deficit creating <b>reflationary</b> <b>policies</b> and conservative budgetary policies. The “original sin” of such a debate lies in the implicit assumption that active public spending is harmful to economic activity at long run without providing consistent analysis of the malfunctioning of financialized and weakened economies. This paper suggests another alternative by bringing together functional finance of Abba Lerner and financial instability hypothesis of Hyman Minsky in order to state the principles of an alternative macroeconomic stabilization framework able to prevent disequilibria-fuelling speculative finance and to sustain job-creating productive activities...|$|R

40|$|John C. Williams {{has written}} a very nice paper on {{monetary}} and fiscal pol-icy in a low inflationary environment when the central bank is constrained by the zero bound on the short-term nominal interest rate. The main new element in the paper is that it deviates from the assumption of rational expectations by assuming learning and explores how this changes {{the results from the}} pre-vious literature. The main message of the previous literature is to emphasize the role of managing expectation, that it is desirable to counteract deflationary shocks by creating expectations of low future nominal interest rates and stimu-lating inflation and output expectations. This paper support this view and even indicates that the policy makers should go further in this direction when expec-tations are not fully rational. William’s paper, however, suggests that under certain assumptions <b>reflationary</b> <b>policies</b> of this kind may not be enough and the economy can experience severe output contractions. Williams emphasizes the need for a positive average inflation target and pro—active fiscal policies as an insurance once the expectation channel fails...|$|R
2500|$|Although the Mauroy government's social {{policies}} improved the living {{standards of the}} less well-off in French society, its reflationary economic strategy (based on encouraging domestic consumption) failed to improve the French economy in the long term, with increases {{in the level of}} inflation {{as well as in the}} trade and budget deficits. Although the government’s <b>reflationary</b> <b>policies</b> tended to stabilise unemployment, the number of people out of work topped 2million, in spite of a pledge made by Mitterrand to keep it below this figure. A large budget deficit emerged, with social benefits and aid to industry alone going up by 50% in the 1982 budget. In addition, private investment failed to respond to the government’s initiatives, with a 12% decline in volume in 1981. This led Mauroy to advocate the abandonment of Socialist economic policies (which failed to reduce unemployment and inflation), a controversial [...] "U-turn" [...] which was ratified by President Mitterrand in March 1983, and a number of austerity measures were carried out. In 1982, housing allowances were decoupled from the cost-of-living adjustment index. In 1982 and 1983, eligibility for unemployment benefits was tightened. A complex set of changes introduced in 1983 surrounding early retirement effectively reduced guarantees to full pensions for early retirees. Daily charges for hospital beds were introduced, while a variety of medical reimbursements were reduced. In September 1982, the indexation of wages and salaries in the public sector was abolished.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} nearly fifty-four years since Ghana nursed {{the dream of}} rapid social and {{economic}} development through science, technology and innovation. Ghana is yet to experience technological transformation {{to the level of}} other countries with which she was at par {{at the time of her}} independence. Gaps in understanding still remain in the Ghanaian experience in the development of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policy. As such, a radical reform of the systems to help in the restructuring and transforming the economy is still lacking. In 2010 the government of Ghana developed an STI policy. The aim of this policy is to address all sectors of the economy in order to achieve growth and economic transformation. Analytically, the thesis takes a critical perspective to situate Ghana’s socio-economic and political history in the discourses of the dependency theory framework and to examine how the STI policy at the higher education level in Ghana was formulated and how this had privileged different interests and what the implications are for the country. Mindful of the gaps and historic policy flows, the study took advantage of the researcher’s insider position as an education expert and experience as the government policy developer. With this position and experience, the researcher orientation from the perspectives of policy-makers in Ghana was qualitative research methodology that focused on a case study approach, documentary analysis linked to a critical discourse analysis, observations, semi-structured and informal interviews and the use of a research diary to collect field data. The field data collected for the empirical analysis were documentary data, interview transcripts, interview notes, observation data and field notes. In a constructivist analysis, the interpretive paradigm approach, the notion of triangulation and reflexivity helped not only to privilege the multiple perspectives but to also illuminate the complexity and differences among the participants and other data sources to improve the quality of the data analysis. The research found that in Ghana’s trajectory to modernity through education, the country was marginalised in technology by the advanced capitalist nations to produce low-skilled personnel to be exploited by corporations. Further, the government subcontracted the World Bank and UNCTAD to produce the 2010 STI policy to the neglect of its established institutions. This makes it difficult for the country to pursue an independent <b>reflationary</b> STI <b>policy.</b> Moreover, the documentary analysis of the policy revealed that the government of Ghana had focused mostly on basic education to the detriment of higher education and STI policy to further marginalise the country in technology to produce a low-skilled Ghana to be exploited by corporations. The implication is Ghana to restructure the content of education to build a solid foundation for the development of the STI policy in the country. The study, therefore, provides a solid critique of the country’s economic policy and international commitments that perpetuate a dependent model of development to the neglect of STI policy in Ghana. In the wake of the new STI policy development paradigms, the study suggests the need for a shift in paradigm from poor interactive learning space to rich interactive learning space, an interactionist model approach underpinned by a rich interactive learning space as an analytical tool and a guide for STI policy formation in Ghana...|$|R
40|$|All things considered, {{anything}} up to US $ 7 trillion of so-called quantitative easing (QE) funds has flooded emerging markets since the 2008 global financial crisis. These funds, created to stimulate a {{recovery in the}} OECD and to stabilise international financial markets, ended up mostly as emerging markets�� corporate bonds and loans (often after being leveraged into many multiples of their original value). They were then either mainly invested (Asia), or used (as in Latin America and South Africa) at best to finance economic activities which do not enhance productive capacities, such as residential construction, or used to finance deficits, M&A, capital flight {{and all sorts of}} financial deeds - including as fuel for any conceivable asset bubble. The enquiries of these issues, especially how corporations financed their investment, and how much of it took place, were subjects that fascinated Ajit. He was the first to find out that corporations in emerging markets relied much more on external finance than those in the OECD (where retained profits played a major role). The implication was that they were likely to be even more susceptible to the vicissitudes of financial markets - and as these became ever more weird (the almost inevitable outcome of hasty deregulation cum excess liquidity), the financial balances of corporate sectors north and south of the Equator ended up moving in opposite directions further than ever before. This is a key (if not the key) difference between current global financial fragilities and those {{at the onset of the}} current global financial crisis in 2007. This highly asymmetric corporate balance scenario is part and parcel of such a low interest rate and highly financialised environment, as now (among other things) so-called ���investors�� in search for elusive yields, inevitably have to take on more risk, leverage and illiquidity. And emerging markets have always been their markets of last resort. This is a vital (yet only implicit) ingredient of the peculiar ideas behind super-accommodative monetary policy; but the downside is the risk of more volatile asset prices (including commodities), and unchartered financial fragilities all over. Closer regulatory scrutiny worldwide, therefore, should have been an intrinsic part of such risky <b>reflationary</b> and monetary <b>policies.</b> But try to get speculators, traders and rentiers (or politicians in need of donations) to understand something, when their (shortterm) earnings, bonuses, share options and corporate-sponsored retirement plans depended on them not understanding it. The stakes for emerging markets' corporations, their economies, financial markets and wider society (and everybody else in the world for that matter) could scarcely be higher - but unfortunately these huge new challenges occur at the worst possible time, as our social imagination has seldom been so barren. financial fragilitie...|$|R
