2500|$|The internationally renowned Faculty of Music at Laurier is {{considered}} one of the best in the country, with programs in performance, music education, composition, music history, church music, theory and music therapy. In addition, Laurier is home to the Penderecki String Quartet - an internationally <b>recognised</b> <b>group</b> playing largely new compositions. The music faculty boasts two performance spaces, the Theatre Auditorium and the Maureen Forrester Recital Hall (named after the famous contralto and former chancellor of Laurier). The faculty also attracts a greater percentage of students from outside Ontario than any other faculty at Laurier. [...] Laurier's Music program offers the only master's degree in Music Therapy. Laurier's strength in [...] "music and business education" [...] had been identified as one of the reasons that Waterloo Region is a [...] "powerful educational hub" [...] by former University of Waterloo president, and now Governor-General of Canada, David Johnston.|$|E

The group {{became one of the}} most successful marketing engines ever, earning up to $75 million per year, with their global grosses estimated at $500–800 million by May 1998. Under the guidance of their mentor and manager Simon Fuller, the Spice Girls embraced merchandising and became a regular feature of the British and global press. In 1996, Top of the Pops magazine gave each member of the group aliases, which were adopted by the group and media. According to Rolling Stone journalist and biographer David Sinclair, [...] "Scary, Baby, Ginger, Posh and Sporty were the most widely <b>recognised</b> <b>group</b> of individuals since John, Paul, George, and Ringo".

50|$|Tulk {{corresponded with}} Johann Caspar Spurzheim. His {{interest}} in phrenology {{led him to}} act as President for the London Phrenological Society in the 1820s and 1830s.

Coleridge's letters to Tulk are a source for his developed thoughts on a system of nature.

5000|$|Higgins {{was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1989. Her {{nomination}} reads: [...] After obtaining a first degree in Physics the candidate undertook {{research in the}} field of Physical Chemistry. She started using neutron scattering as a tool for investigating molecular structure and dynamics at this stage, first applying the techniques to the study of polymers while a post-doctoral research assistant in the Chemistry Department at Manchester. She was closely involved with the development of new techniques, their application in Polymer Science and the formation of an international community of scientists using these techniques while employed as a Physicist at the Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble.Since Since sic returning to the UK at Imperial she has built an internationally <b>recognised</b> <b>group.</b> She is well-known for her studies of the dynamics of polymer molecules, especially in the bulk state and, more recently the thermodynamics and demixing processes in polymer blends. Dr Higgins has a wonderful ability for recognizing when a new area of polymer science is ripe for experimental study and has a row of 'firsts' to her credit.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1950 s, the {{dominant}} paradigm {{in the human}} genetics of infectious diseases postulates that rare monogenic immunodeficiencies confer vulnerability to multiple infectious diseases (one gene, multiple infections), whereas common infections {{are associated with the}} polygenic inheritance of multiple susceptibility genes (one infection, multiple genes). Recent studies, since 1996 in particular, have challenged this view. A newly <b>recognised</b> <b>group</b> of primary immunodeficiencies predisposing the individual to a principal or single type of infection is emerging. In parallel, several common infections have been shown to reflect the inheritance of one major susceptibility gene, at least in some populations. This novel causal relationship (one gene, one infection) blurs the distinction between patient-based Mendelian genetics and population-based complex genetics, and provides a unified conceptual frame for exploring the molecular genetic basis of infectious diseases in humans...|$|E
40|$|THE {{isolation}} of enteric bacteria {{that do not}} conform to any of the recognised genera and species is common in clinical microbiology departments. The family Enterobacteriaceae consists of a continuous spectrum of closely related types and is difficult to subdivide. However, Edwards and Ewing (1962) showed that most cultures can be allotted to groups on the basis of similarity of biochemical properties. These groups constitute the currently accepted genera and species in the family. When a number of isolates from different sources give the same biochemical pattern and this does not fit any of the recognised groups there are two possible explanations. A single aberrant strain may have become locally prevalent as a result of cross-infection, or the isolates may represent a distinct but not generally <b>recognised</b> <b>group</b> of enterobacteria. This paper describes the investi-gation of such a group of organisms...|$|E
40|$|ISHp 608 from Helicobacter pylori {{is active}} in Escherichia coli and {{represents}} a recently <b>recognised</b> <b>group</b> of insertion sequences. Its transposase and organisation suggest that it transposes using a different mechanism {{to that of other}} known transposons. The IS was shown to excise as a circular form, which is accompanied by the formation of a resealed donor plasmid backbone. We also demonstrate that TnpA, which is less than half the length of other transposases, is responsible for this and for ISHp 608 transposition. Transposition was shown to be site specific: both insertion and transposon excision require a conserved target, 5 ′TTAC. Deletion analysis suggested that potential secondary structures at the left and right ends are important for transposition. In vitro TnpA bound both ends, showed a strong preference for a specific single-stranded DNA and introduced a single-strand break on the same strand at each end. Although many of the characteristics of ISHp 608 appear similar to rolling-circle transposons, there are differences suggesting that, overall, transposition occurs by a different mechanism. The results have permitted the formulation of several related models...|$|E
