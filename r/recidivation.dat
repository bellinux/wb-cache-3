40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effect of Ruyiping, a {{traditional}} Chinese compound herbal medicine composed of 5 Chinese herbs for removing toxic materials and dissipating nodules from RuningⅡ, another traditional Chinese compound herbal medicine for treating breast cancer, in preventing <b>recidivation</b> and metastasis in breast cancer patients after operation. Methods: Eighty patients with breast cancer after operation were randomly divided into Ruyiping group and Runing Ⅱ group, and prescribed Ruyiping and Runing Ⅱ {{on the basis of}} chemotherapy, radiotherapy and endocrine therapy respectively for two years. Results: There were two patients with metastasis and three patients lost to follow-up in Ruyiping group and three and two in Runing Ⅱ group. The <b>recidivation</b> and metastasis rates were 5. 41 % and 7. 89 % respectively. The {{difference between the two groups}} was not statistically significant (P＞ 0. 05). The difference of disease-free survival time between the two groups was also not statistically significant. Conclusions: The effect of Ruyiping in preventing <b>recidivation</b> and metastasis is similar to that of Runing Ⅱ. Ruyiping is the essential component of Runing Ⅱ for preventing <b>recidivation</b> and metastasis. The result provides some clinical evidences for the theory that ''Yudu Pangcuan'' (vestigial poison invasion elsewhere) is the essential pathogenesis of breast cancer's <b>recidivation</b> and metastasis and the utilization of ''Sanjie Jiedu'' (dispersing accumulation and detoxification) is the therapeutic principle in preventing <b>recidivation</b> and metastasis after operation...|$|E

In this study, we investigated the effect of hypoxia on the differentiation of corneal limbal epithelium using an ex vivo squamous metaplasia model. Under normoxic conditions when exposed to air, the hyperproliferation and abnormal epidermal-like differentiation of human corneal limbal epithelium was induced, whereas when exposed to air under hypoxic conditions, although we observed augmented proliferation, the abnormal differentiation was inhibited. The Notch signaling pathway was activated in hypoxic cultures, whereas the p 38 MAPK signaling pathway was downregulated. The addition of Notch inhibitor under hypoxic conditions restored the activation of p 38 MAPK and resulted in the <b>recidivation</b> of limbal epithelial cells to epidermal-like differentiation. Moreover, the epidermal-like differentiation of rabbit limbal epithelial cells was also blocked under hypoxic conditions in corneal epithelial cell sheets engineered ex vivo. We concluded that hypoxia can prevent abnormal differentiation while enhancing the proliferation of corneal limbal epithelial cells. Hypoxia coupled with air exposure can be used in the tissue engineering of corneal limbal epithelium. J. Cell. Physiol. 226 : 2429 - 2437, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E

Liver biopsy findings were those of cellular infiltration along the bile ducts, interstitial hepatitis, cholangitis with or without obstruction-jaundice. Those pathological changes were well consistant with the clinical evaluation of the diseases and were varied by the degree, course and <b>recidivation</b> of the inflammatory and obstructive changes. Himsworth descrived inflammatory and degenerative changes of the biliaiy tract and named 2 ̆ 2 CHOLANGIOHEPATITIS 2 ̆ 2. Cholangiohepatitis is caused by inflammatory process of the biliary tracts, regardless of common duct obstruction. Even {{when there was no}} common duct obstruction, we found high alkaline phosphatase and normal bilirubin in the blood, so called 2 ̆ 2 disociation 2 ̆ 2 bilirubin. The value of alkaline phosphatase has relation to bromsulphalein retention and it changes according to the extent of intrahepatic bile ducts inflammation. These findings have clinical importance. Prevention of bile flow are caused by inflammatory process in the intrahepatic bile ducts, especially 2 ̆ 2 cholangioles 2 ̆ 2, and their surrounding connective tissues. The excretion of Biligrafin and antibiotics in bile are prevented by inflammatory process at the intrahepatic bile ducts. These facts also support our point of view.

Established has been the absence of the dependence between the indicators of the blasts clearance test on the peripheral blood and marrow. To estimate the sensitivity of the lymphoblasts to the prednizolon, the test of the blast cells clearance has been offered.

The surgery is the only available treatment, and complete surgical excision is decisive. From August 1995 to January 2003, in the casuistry of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Santa Marta’s Hospital, were analyzed all the patients with the diagnosis of localized fibrous tumour of the pleura (TFLP). In this context, were identified 11 patients with a medium age of 57, 54 years old, 6 of them females, in which the diagnosis of located fibrous tumour of the pleura was established; 6 of the tumours were classified as malignant. All the patients were submitted to surgical excision, with different techniques, without significant intra-operative mortality or intra-hospital morbidity, despite the difficulty of surgery in the most voluminous tumours (one of the tumours weight was 2, 5 kg).

Tais dados sugerem que, embora exista uma relação entre as variáveis dos dois instrumentos, estas variáveis não se sobrepõem substancialmente.

La mayoría de estos casos presentaban lesiones citopáticas asociadas a virus papiloma humano, VPH. Los casos de cáncer fueron etapas iniciales que siguieron protocolo estándar.
