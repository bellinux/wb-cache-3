Electroacoustic performance of the ALDs varied although there were similarities for different types of devices. Frequency responses were either basically flat or had an emphasis in the low or mid-frequency region. The majority of devices provided negligible amplification when set at or below half volume.

40|$|Direct cloning of PCR {{fragments}} by TA cloning or {{blunt end}} ligation are two simple methods which would greatly benefit high-throughput (HTP) cloning constructions if the efficiency can be improved. In this study, {{we have developed}} a ribosomal binding site (RBS) switching strategy for direct cloning of PCR fragments. RBS is an A/G rich region upstream of the translational start codon and is essential for gene expression. Change from A/G to T/C in the RBS blocks its activity and thereby abolishes gene expression. Based on this property, we introduced an inactive RBS upstream of a selectable marker gene, and designed a fragment insertion site within this inactive RBS. Forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>insertions</b> of specifically tailed fragments will respectively form an active and inactive RBS, thus all background from vector self-ligation and fragment <b>reverse</b> <b>insertions</b> will be eliminated due to the non-expression of the marker gene. The effectiveness of our strategy for TA cloning and blunt end ligation are confirmed. Application of this strategy to gene over-expression, a bacterial two-hybrid system, a bacterial one-hybrid system, and promoter bank construction are also verified. The advantages of this simple procedure, together with its low cost and high efficiency, makes our strategy extremely useful in HTP cloning constructions...|$|R

The hearing instrument with a partially covered microphone entrance proved best, whereas one with an open microphone entrance had the poorest performance. A reduction in wind noise of 6 - 17 dB could be achieved in all hearing instruments by using a simple windscreen made of Styrofoam. The windscreen affected the frequency response by less than 2 dB. By subtracting the <b>insertion</b> <b>gain</b> from the wind noise, an equivalent wind noise could be presented as a function of frequency.

To maximise the benefits of the hearing aid, the methods used to assess the amount of amplification provided to the child's ear must be accurate. Two methods used to assess the amount of amplification are functional <b>gain</b> and <b>insertion</b> <b>gain.</b> The real ear gain was measured in seventeen preschool children using these techniques. The study aimed to determine whether these measures were equivalent and to assess the accuracy of each measure in this preschool population.

40|$|When {{hearing aid}} gain is {{prescribed}} by software, gain is calculated {{based on the}} average acoustics for the age of patient, gender, mold type, and so on. The acoustics of the individual’s ear often vary from the average values, so there will be a mismatch between the prescribed gain and the real-ear gain. Real-ear measurement can be used to verify the gain and adjust it to meet targets, but the quality of the match will be limited by the number of channels and the flexibility of the hearing aid. A potential way to improve this process is to generate a filter that compensates for variations in real-ear <b>insertion</b> <b>gain</b> due to individual ear acoustics. Such a filter could be included in the processing path of a digital hearing aid. This article describes how such a filter can be generated using the windowing method, and the principle is demonstrated in a real ear.

Material and Methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled interventional trial was conducted on 100 patients to compare <b>reversed</b> <b>insertion</b> of the i-gel™ (Group R) with the conventional insertion (Group C). In Group C, i-gel™ was introduced in a conventional manner, whereas in the Group R, i-gel™ was introduced into the oral cavity with the concavity facing the hard palate. On reaching the oropharynx, the device was rotated 180 ° and advanced further until it fitted over the larynx. The time of insertion, ease, and placement appropriateness were compared. Results: All patients completed the study. Better success rate of the first attempt insertion was achieved using the reversed technique (96 % vs. 86 %), {{but it was not}} statistically significant. Mean time required for i-gel™ insertion in Group R was 17. 5 ± 6. 9 s as compared to 20. 8 ± 5. 9 s in Group C, which was statistically significant.

It is shown that a linear array of prisms, slightlyinclined with respect to the optical axis, will form a linefocus at a certain distance from the lens. Hence, the namemulti-prism lens. These lenses are free from sphericalaberration and are similar to planar parabolic compoundrefractive lenses in terms of performance. However, theydistinguish themselves in that only planar surfaces need to befabricated. A special feature is that the focal length can beeasily varied by adjusting the inclination angle. Theoretical calculations, based on geometrical and physicaloptics, are used to characterize the lenses. Aberrations arediscussed, as well as the sensitivity to fabricationimperfections, and insufficient flatness is identified as apotential problem. Ray-tracing is used to test theapproximations and assumptions used in the theory. Applicationsin x-ray microscopy and mammography are discussed. Lenses have been made of beryllium, silicon, epoxy anddiamond using different methods. Results from measurements ofsurface roughness and figure error show that the imperfectionsof the silicon and epoxy lenses should have a small impact,while the beryllium lenses should suffer from strongscattering. Experiments were performed at the EuropeanSynchrotron Radiation Facility and sub-µm focal linewidths, close to theoretical expectations, were measured forsilicon and epoxy lenses at 30 keV and 14 keV, respectively. <b>Insertion</b> <b>gains</b> up to 40 were reached. Two crossed lenses wereused to obtain focusing in two dimensions and a point focus.

40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of ground-borne vibration {{levels in the}} vicinity of an underground railway are greatly sought in modern urban centers. Yet the complexity involved in simulating the underground environment means {{that it is necessary to}} make simplifying assumptions about this environment. One such commonly-made assumption is to model the railway as a single tunnel, despite many underground railway lines consisting of twin-bored tunnels. A unique model for two tunnels embedded in a homogeneous, elastic full space is developed. The vibration response of this two-tunnel system is calculated using the superposition of two displacement fields: one resulting from the forces acting on the invert of a single tunnel, and the other resulting from the interaction between the tunnels. By partitioning of the stresses into symmetric and anti-symmetric mode number components using Fourier decomposition, these two displacement fields can by calculated with minimal computational requirements. The significance of the interactions between twin-tunnels is quantified by calculating the <b>insertion</b> <b>gains</b> that result from the existence of a second tunnel. The insertion-gain results are shown to be localized and highly dependent on frequency, tunnel orientation and tunnel thickness. At some locations, the magnitude of these <b>insertion</b> <b>gains</b> is greater than 20 dB.

40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of ground-borne vibration {{levels in the}} vicinity of an underground railway are greatly sought after in modern urban centres. Yet the complexity involved in simulating the underground environment means {{that it is necessary to}} make simplifying assumptions about this system. One such commonly made assumption is to ignore the effects of neighbouring tunnels, despite the fact that many underground railway lines consist of twin-bored tunnels, one for the outbound direction and one for the inbound direction. This paper presents a unique model for two tunnels embedded in a homogeneous, elastic fullspace. Each of these tunnels is subject to both known, dynamic train forces and dynamic cavity forces. The net forces acting on the tunnels are written as the sum of those tractions acting on the invert of a single tunnel, and those tractions that represent the motion induced by the neighbouring tunnel. By apportioning the tractions in this way, the vibration response of a two-tunnel system is written as a linear combination of displacement fields produced by a single-tunnel system. Using Fourier decomposition, forces are partitioned into symmetric and antisymmetric modenumber components to minimise computation times. The significance of the interactions between two tunnels is quantified by calculating the <b>insertion</b> <b>gains,</b> in both the vertical and horizontal directions, that result from the existence of a second tunnel. The insertion-gain results are shown to be localised and highly dependent on frequency, tunnel orientation and tunnel thickness. At some locations, the magnitude of these <b>insertion</b> <b>gains</b> is greater than 20 dB. This demonstrates that a high degree of inaccuracy exists in any surface vibration prediction model that includes only one of the two tunnels. This novel two-tunnel solution represents a significant contribution to the existing body of research into vibration from underground railways, as it shows that the second tunnel has a significant influence on the accuracy of vibration predictions for underground railways...|$|R
