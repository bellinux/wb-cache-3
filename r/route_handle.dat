40|$|Abstract—Multi-hop {{cognitive}} radio networks (CRNs) are gain-ing interest recently in many practical applications. With location information becoming more available, designing location-aware routing protocols that fit {{the nature of}} CRNs becomes a necessity. We present LAUNCH as a location-aided routing protocol for CRNs that has a set of desirable properties: efficient use of the common control channel, has a minimal route setup delay, prefers stable <b>routes,</b> <b>handles</b> primary users heterogeneity, and handles secondary users mobility. LAUNCH is based on four main concepts: (1) a novel location-aware CRN routing metric {{that takes into account}} the PUs activity; (2) distributed calculations at the neighbors; (3) a channel locking mechanism to achieve the route stability and minimize channel switching time; (4) an efficient route mainte-nance strategy. Evaluation of LAUNCH on the NS 2 simulator shows that its performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art CRNs routing protocols in terms of end-to-end delay and packet loss rate. In addition, LAUNCH incurs a low control overhead with a fast route establishment delay. I...|$|R

The fact that incidents still happen in air traffic control shows that this might be unjustified. To verify this assumption, seven expert {{air traffic controllers}} completed an online-survey consisting of videos and screenshots captured from three real-time simulations of approach scenarios on Düsseldorf airport, Germany. Every scenario was designed to end in separation loss of two aircraft. In each scenario, subjects were asked to provide as many options to deal with the situation one minute prior to the incident as possible. Results show differences between experts regarding the quality and quantity of options successfully preventing separation loss given in the scenarios, indicating different strategies of dealing with conflict situations among subjects...|$|R

The tokens that refer messages to recipients are variously known as <b>routes,</b> addresses, <b>handles,</b> and names, roughly according to their relative nearness to network topology vs. human meaning. All four sorts of token refer in some way to a recipient. Substantial confusion has arisen regarding which sorts of tokens are needed in various network operations and applications. This article provides a conceptual overview of the function of <b>routes,</b> addresses, <b>handles,</b> and names in a communications network, with a rough description of the relevance to the global Internet. I find that all four sorts of tokens are important to maximizing the utility of the network. But the value in four levels of reference cannot be understood in terms of the network technicalities of efficient implementation of individual acts of communication. Rather, the value of such multilevel reference derives from administrative considerations based on the multiplicity of parties who should enjoy authority over, and bear responsibility for, different aspects of network operations and applications. 0. 1 I think this first version is already fairly readable, but the target audience is not clear.
