5000|$|FLIM has {{primarily}} {{been used}} in biology as a method to detect photosensitizers in cells and tumors as well as FRET in instances where <b>ratiometric</b> imaging is difficult. The technique {{was developed in the}} late 1980s and early 1990s (Gating method: Bugiel et al. 1989. König 1989, Phase modulation: Lakowicz at al. 1992,) before being more widely applied in the late 1990s. In cell culture, it has been used to study EGF receptor signaling and ErbB1 receptor trafficking. [...] Time domain FLIM (tdFLIM) has also been used to show the interaction of both types of nuclear intermediate filament proteins lamins A and B1 in distinct homopolymers at the nuclear envelope, which further interact with each other in higher order structures. FLIM imaging is particularly useful in neurons, where light scattering by brain tissue is problematic for <b>ratiometric</b> imaging.

The entire {{field of view}} is imaged simultaneously on two wavelength channels, which corresponds to the red and blue flank of the plasmon ruler resonance. The spectral information of an individual plasmon ruler is expressed in the intensity distribution on the two monitored channels, quantified as R=(I1-I2)/(I1+I2). Each R value corresponds to a certain nanometer scale distance which can be calculated using computer simulation or generated from experiments.|$|E
50|$|The {{processor}} module {{featured a}} 10 volt reference for its analog-to-digital converter {{which was used}} to gather data from various sensors. This {{could have been an}} issue as the available power to the module varied above and below 10 volts during engine cranking. The problem was solved by several steps. First, all sensors used a <b>ratiometric</b> measuring method that insured accuracy in spite of varying reference voltage. Second, during cranking, a special circuit triggered the ignition system in synchronization with the reference pulses from the engine. Third, the processor was not allowed to start until the internal voltage was stabilized above 10 volts.|$|E
50|$|Regardless of {{the type}} of {{indicator}} used the imaging procedure is generally very similar. Cells loaded with an indicator or expressing it in the case of GECI, can be viewed using a fluorescence microscope and captured by a CCD camera. Confocal and two-photon microscopes provide improved sectioning ability so that calcium signals can be resolved in micro domains or (for example) synaptic boutons. Images are analyzed by measuring fluorescence intensity changes for a single wavelength or two wavelengths expressed as a ratio (<b>ratiometric</b> indicators). The derived fluorescence intensities and ratios are plotted against calibrated values for known Ca2+ levels to learn Ca2+ concentration. Light field microscopy methods extend functional readout of neural activity capabilities in 3D volumes.|$|E
5000|$|Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester, often {{abbreviated}} Fura-2AM, is a membrane-permeable {{derivative of}} the <b>ratiometric</b> calcium indicator Fura-2 used in biochemistry to measure cellular calcium concentrations by fluorescence. When added to cells, Fura-2AM crosses cell membranes and {{once inside the}} cell, the acetoxymethyl groups are removed by cellular esterases. Removal of the acetoxymethyl esters regenerates [...] "Fura-2", the pentacarboxylate calcium indicator. Measurement of Ca2+-induced fluorescence at both 340 nm and 380 nm allows for calculation of calcium concentrations based 340/380 ratios. The use of the ratio automatically cancels out certain variables such as local differences in fura-2 concentration or cell thickness that would otherwise lead to artifacts when attempting to image calcium concentrations in cells.|$|E
5000|$|Cameleon is an {{engineered}} protein {{based on}} variant of {{green fluorescent protein}} used to visualize calcium levels in living cells. It is a genetically encoded calcium sensor created by Roger Y. Tsien and coworkers. The name is a conflation of CaM (the common abbreviation of calmodulin) and chameleon to indicate {{the fact that the}} sensor protein undergoes a conformation change and radiates at an altered wavelength upon calcium binding to the calmodulin element of the Cameleon. Cameleon was the first genetically encoded calcium sensor {{that could be used for}} <b>ratiometric</b> measurements and the first to be used in a transgenic animal to record activity in neurons and muscle cells. [...] Cameleon and other genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) have found many applications in neuroscience and other fields of biology.

5000|$|Magnetoresistance type {{fuel level}} sensors, now {{becoming}} common in small aircraft applications, offer a potential alternative for automotive use. These fuel level sensors work {{similar to the}} potentiometer example, however a sealed detector at the float pivot determines the angular position of a magnet pair at the pivot end of the float arm. These are highly accurate, and the electronics are completely outside the fuel. The non-contact nature of these sensors address the fire and explosion hazard, and also the issues related to any fuel combinations or additives to gasoline or to any alcohol fuel mixtures. Magneto resistive sensors are suitable for all fuel or fluid combinations, including LPG and LNG. The fuel level output for these senders can be <b>ratiometric</b> voltage or preferable CAN bus digital. These sensors also fail-safe in that they either provide a level output or nothing.|$|E

It integrated a low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) transmitter for notebook LCDs and advanced power management (block-by-block power control). The RAGE LT PRO, based on the 3D RAGE PRO, was the very first mobile GPU to use AGP. It offered Filtered <b>Ratiometric</b> Expansion, which automatically adjusted images to full-screen size. ATI's ImpacTV2+ is integrated with the RAGE LT PRO chip to support multi-screen viewing; i.e., simultaneous outputs to TV, CRT and LCD. In addition, the RAGE LT PRO can drive two displays with different images and/or refresh rates with the use of integrated dual, independent CRT controllers. The Rage LT Pro was often used in desktop video cards that had a VESA Digital Flat Panel port to drive some desktop LCD monitors digitally.|$|E
5000|$|Fura-2, an aminopolycarboxylic acid, is a <b>ratiometric</b> {{fluorescent}} dye which binds to free intracellular calcium. [...] It {{was the first}} widely used dye for calcium imaging, and remains very popular. Fura-2 is excited at 340 nm and 380 nm of light, and {{the ratio of the}} emissions at those wavelengths {{is directly related to the}} amount of intracellular calcium. Regardless of the presence of calcium, Fura-2 emits at 510 nm of light. The use of the ratio automatically cancels out confounding variables, such as variable dye concentration and cell thickness, making Fura-2 one of the most appreciated tools to quantify calcium levels. The high photon yield of fura-2 allowed the first real time (video rate) measurements of calcium inside living cells in 1986. More recently, genetically-encoded calcium indicators based on spectral variants of the green fluorescent protein, such as Cameleons, have supplemented the use of Fura-2 and other small molecule dyes for calcium imaging, but Fura-2 remains faster.|$|E

40|$|Intracellular pH {{is a key}} {{parameter}} in many biological {{mechanisms and}} cell metabolism and is used to detect and monitor cancer formation and brain or heart diseases. pH-sensing is typically performed by fluorescence microscopy using pH-responsive dyes. Accuracy {{is limited by the}} need for quantifying the absolute emission intensity in living biological samples. An alternative with a higher sensitivity and precision uses probes with a <b>ratiometric</b> response arising from the different pH-sensitivity of two emission channels of a single emitter. Current <b>ratiometric</b> probes are complex constructs suffering from instability and cross-readout due to their broad emission spectra. Here, we overcome such limitations using a single-particle <b>ratiometric</b> pH probe based on dot-in-bulk CdSe/CdS nanocrystals (NCs). These nanostructures feature two fully-separated narrow emissions with different pH sensitivity arising from radiative recombination of core- and shell-localized excitons. The core emission is nearly independent of the pH, whereas the shell luminescence increases in the 3 - 11 pH range, resulting in a cross-readout-free <b>ratiometric</b> response as strong as 600 %.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of wireless non-contact temperature measurement systems out there {{but most of them}} are work at high temperatures or do not have sufficient resolution for use in the physiological domain (30 �C- 42 �C). Even to this date, temperature measurement in incubators is done by attaching thermistor probes to the skin of the baby. This thesis presents a non-contact temperature measurement system designed for neonatal care. The system removes the need of attaching thermistor probes to the neonate's skin and therefore reduces the risk of epidermal stripping, microbial infections, etc. The fluorescence intensity ratio (<b>ratiometric)</b> technique is utilized to determine the temperature of a target using temperature responsive fluorophores. This technique measures the changes in the fluorescence intensity as the temperature is changed. The <b>ratiometric</b> technique utilizes two separate fluorophores where one is non-sensitive to temperature and thus serves as a reference. Determining results using <b>ratiometric</b> techniques also minimizes changes in the final measurements when environmental changes such as changes in ambient lights occur. An illuminator is employed to excite the fluorophores which then emit fluorescence that is measured by a camera. This is done by capturing consecutive frames with the illuminator on and then off and then subtracting them. The data is captured, stored, pre-processed and sent to the computer using an FPGA. The MATLAB computational environment is utilized to carry out final processing and display of the <b>ratiometric</b> values. The thesis looks into variable situational changes that can present themselves during actual application of the system and studies the effect on the stability of the <b>ratiometric</b> fluorescence measured.
