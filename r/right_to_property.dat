5|$|The Fundamental Rights, {{embodied}} in Part III of the Constitution, guarantee civil rights to all Indians, {{and prevent the}} State from encroaching on individual liberty while simultaneously placing upon it an obligation to protect the citizens' rights from encroachment by society. Seven fundamental rights were originally provided by the Constitution– right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights, <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>property</b> and right to constitutional remedies. However, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>property</b> was removed from Part III of the Constitution by the 44th Amendment in 1978.|$|E
5|$|As a rationalist and ardent social reformer, Periyar {{advocated}} forcefully {{throughout his}} life that women should be given their legitimate position in society as the equals of men {{and that they should}} be given good education and have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>property.</b> He thought age and social customs was not a bar in marrying women. He was keen that women should realise their rights and be worthy citizens of their country.|$|E

An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{whether there}} should be a separate international Covenant to elaborate on the human <b>right</b> <b>to</b> own <b>property.</b> Citing two contemporary cases—namely,the semi-starvation faced by many citizens of Zimbabwe and the shortage of food in Venezuela—I argue that a human <b>right</b> <b>to</b> own <b>property</b> protects the economic human <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> adequate food and freedom from hunger. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> own <b>property</b> is also crucial to the economic development necessary to ensure that human beings can supply themselves with food and otherwise support themselves. As such, it is a strategic human right, a right that protects other rights. I also argue that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> own <b>property</b> is an intrinsic human right, valuable in itself as a component of human dignity. The article ends with a brief proposal for an elaborated Covenant on the human <b>right</b> <b>to</b> own <b>property...</b>|$|R

50|$|In current-day China, women enjoy legal equal <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>property,</b> but in {{practice}} these rights are often difficult to realize.

In imperial China (before 1911 C.E.), family households held property collectively, rather than as individual members of the household.

25|$|Articles 26 to 28 cover {{fundamental}} economic rights. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>property</b> is guaranteed, and expropriations made {{subject to}} full compensation, by article 26.

Although some state monopolies are permitted (by way of art. 94), and differing cantonal regulations still impede the intercantonal exercise of some regulated professions, the wide {{extent to which}} economic freedom is guaranteed is a distinguishing feature of the Swiss constitution, both in theory and practice. Parliament's extensive discussions about this provision reflect a fundamental systemic decision in favour of a free market economy.|$|E

In 2007, Chief Justice Abdulai Conteh ruled in favor of the Maya communities of Conejo and Santa Cruz, citing the IACHR judgement and key precedents from other common law jurisdictions.

25|$|An {{administrator}} (sometimes {{known as}} the administratrix, if female) acts as the personal representative of the deceased in relation to land and other property in the UK. Consequently, when the estate under administration consists wholly or mainly of land, the court will grant administration to {{the heir to the}} exclusion of the next of kin. In the absence of any heir or next of kin, the Crown has the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>property</b> (other than land) as bona vacantia, and to the land by virtue of the historic land rights of the Crown (and the Duchy of Cornwall and Duchy of Lancaster in their respective areas). If a creditor claims and obtains a Grant of Administration, the court compels him or her to enter into a bond with two sureties that he or she will not prefer his or her own debt to those of other creditors.|$|E

40|$|Articles 2 (a) -(f) and 16 (1) (h) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) {{prohibit}} {{discrimination and}} enjoin State parties to ensure substantive equality {{between men and}} women in marriage and family relations. To ensure compliance with the CEDAW, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW Committee) examines State parties' periodic reports and makes pertinent observations. In 1985 by ratifying the CEDAW without any reservations, Uganda willingly undertook to make her laws and institutions regulating <b>rights</b> of succession <b>to</b> <b>property</b> compliant with the CEDAW. On 9 th August 2002 the CEDAW Committee expressed concern over the country's state-made and non-state-made laws of marriage and succession. Uganda was called upon to remove, in family relations, among others, de jure discrimination and eliminate de facto discrimination against her women. With the above concerns in mind, this dissertation primarily measures Uganda's laws and institutions regulating <b>rights</b> of succession <b>to</b> <b>property</b> with the standards set by the CEDAW. <b>To</b> clarify <b>rights</b> of succession <b>to</b> <b>property,</b> however, laws and institutions regulating <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>property</b> in marriage and upon divorce are also juxtaposed against the said CEDAW standards. The dissertation suggests reforms with a view to making Uganda's said laws and institutions compliant with Articles 2 (a) -(f) and 16 (1) (h) of the CEDAW. Whilst some of the law reform propositions are based on intuition, given that countries rarely improve their laws without looking at what other jurisdictions are doing, this dissertation has sought progressive ideas from the English, Scots and South African laws and institutions regulating <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>property</b> in marriage, upon divorce and upon the death of a spouse. While there is legal pluralism in Uganda's laws and institutions regulating women's <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>property</b> in marriage, upon divorce and upon the death of a spouse, such pluralism should not prevail over compliance with Articles 2 (a) -(f) and 16 (1) (h) of the CEDAW, as an international legal imperative: women's <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>property</b> in Uganda may be regulated by state-made, customary and Islamic family laws and institutions so long as compliance with Articles 2 (a) -(f) and 16 (1) (h) of the CEDAW is guaranteed...|$|R

25|$|In 1788/89, Minas Gerais was {{the setting}} of the most {{important}} conspiracy against colonial authorities, the so-called Inconfidência Mineira, inspired by the ideals of the French liberal philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment and the successful American Revolution of 1776. The conspirators largely belonged to the white upper class of Minas Gerais. Many had studied in Europe, especially in the University of Coimbra, and some had large debts with the colonial government. In the context of declining gold production, the intention of the Portuguese government to impose the obligatory payment of all debts (the derrama) was a leading cause behind the conspiracy. The conspirators wanted to create a Republic in which the leader would be chosen through democratic elections. The capital would be São João del Rei, and Ouro Preto would become a university town. The structure of the society, including the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>property</b> and the ownership of slaves, would be kept intact.|$|E
500|$|The {{provisions}} {{relating to}} the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>property</b> were changed a number of times. The Forty-Fourth Amendment of 1978 [...] {{from the list of}} fundamental rights A new provision, Article 300-A, was added to the constitution, which provided that [...] "no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law". Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, there would be no obligation {{on the part of the}} State to pay anything as compensation. The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>property</b> is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right. If the government appears to have acted unfairly, the action can be challenged in a court of law by citizens.|$|E
500|$|The Constitution {{originally}} {{provided for}} the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>property</b> under Articles 19 and 31.
