Potential electrical energy supplies include hydropower, wind turbines, or photovoltaic cells. Usually, the electricity consumed is more valuable than the hydrogen produced so this method has not been widely used. Other potential energy supplies include heat from nuclear reactors and light from the sun.

Alkaline electrolysers are an attractive technology to produce carbon-free Hydrogen from <b>renewable</b> <b>generated</b> <b>electricity.</b> Large scale alkaline electrolysers used in future Hydrogen filling stations could also be utilised to improve the frequency stability of the electricity power system. The electrolyser load can be controlled to respond to power system frequency variations, {{and in the case}} of a sudden loss of generation, these electrolysers could rapidly decrease their load on the system to maintain the power balance. In this work, the potential of alkaline electrolysers to dynamically stabilise the frequency of the power system is assessed. A model of steam turbine generation unit has been developed in MATLAB SIMULINK environment, and a scenario in which there is a sudden loss of generation in the system is examined. It is demonstrated that alkaline electrolysers could prevent unacceptable frequency drop, i. e. below the statutory limit, following by an abrupt loss of generation, even with no spinning reserve on the system. In this paper for the first time, the ramping rate of an alkaline electrolyser is shown through experimental data...|$|E

40|$|With {{the growth}} of <b>renewable</b> <b>generated</b> <b>electricity</b> in the energy mix, large energy storage and {{flexible}} demand, particularly aggregated demand response is becoming a front runner as a new participant in the wholesale energy markets. One of the biggest barriers for the integration of aggregator services into market participation is knowledge of the current and future flexible capacity. To calculate the available flexibility, the current aggregator pilot and simulation implementations use lower level measurements and device specifications. This type of implementation is not scalable due to computational constraints, {{as well as it}} could conflict with end user privacy rights. Black box machine learning approaches have been proven to accurately estimate the available capacity of a cluster of heating devices using only aggregated data. This study will investigate the accuracy of this approach when applied to a heterogeneous virtual power plant (VPP). Firstly, a sensitivity analysis of the machine learning model is performed when varying the underlying device makeup of the VPP. Further, the forecasted flexible capacity of a heterogeneous residential VPP was applied to a trade strategy, which maintains a day ahead schedule, as well as offers flexibility to the imbalance market. This performance is then compared when using the same strategy with no capacity forecasting, as well as perfect knowledge. It was shown that at most, the highest average error, regardless of the VPP makeup, was still less than 9 %. Further, when applying the forecasted capacity to a trading strategy, 89 % of the optimal performance can be met. This resulted in a reduction of monthly costs by approximately 20 %...|$|E
40|$|The Australian {{renewable}} energy industry represents {{an opportunity for}} Australia {{to move away from}} a reliance on fossil fuels and harness clean and secure energy for the future. The GreenPower initiative has been implemented to help facilitate the growth of this industry, by providing consumers with the option to pay a premium for electricity generated by renewable sources. This initiative gives customers a degree of control over the development of <b>renewable</b> <b>generated</b> <b>electricity</b> capacity, which can be encouraged by both governments and energy utilities for mutual benefit. Governments and energy utilities {{have a vested interest in}} the growth of this industry, whether to ensure emission reduction commitments are met, adhere to mandatory {{renewable energy}} targets (MRET) or to use as a source of potential competitive advantage. These interests can be realised through increasing consumer demand for GreenPower which can be achieved through targeted communications campaigns. Those consumers with the greatest propensity to purchase GreenPower have been identified to hold pro-environmental views and altruistic attitudes. This audience could be targeted through communications which utilise the elements of behavioural economics; social influence and choice architecture. Furthermore this communications approach could be extended to leverage the uptake of existing customers to increase demand and uptake amongst a wider audience. This strategy is not proposed as a replacement for existing policy mechanisms such as the MRET or the carbon tax, but rather as an additional measure which could be successfully implemented by governments and/or energy utilities in a cost effective manner. The ability of communications to increase consumer demand for GreenPower is supported by academic literature and it is believed is an important step in helping this initiative realise its full potential...|$|E
40|$|This {{commentary}} summarizes {{and suggests}} some technological implications and interpretations for installation subsidies and income subsidies {{for renewable energy}} deployment. Installation subsidies incentivize adoption by financing part of the up-front installation cost. Income subsidies incentivize actual generation of renewable electricity using the hardware installation. Noted programs in this category include the various feed-in-tariff (FIT) instruments. We attempt to develop some technological interpretations for these two categories of instruments: Installation subsidies induce innovations which contribute to cost reduction driven by learning curve and local systems integration (Shum et al. 2008). Such policy instruments reinforce the notion of renewable energy technology as a manufactured technology. Income subsidies, on the other hand, induce innovations in policy and a cluster of technologies at network level, beyond the unit, such as grid access and interconnection technologies, smart metering and communications technologies which enables trading of <b>renewable</b> <b>generated</b> <b>electricity</b> among units and the grid operator. Income induces an adoption externality at network level. Income subsidies render the renewable energy technology behaves like an information technology. The dichotomy between manufactured technology and information technology (Watanabe et al. 2005) serves as a novel framework to discuss & distinguish ex-post innovation focus in technological and policy realms of different fiscal instruments. This greatly sharpens the focus of policy making beyond just effective administering those instruments. From a theoretical viewpoint, our analysis re-formulates the renewable energy deployment problem as an innovation management problem contingent upon the type of policy instruments used and the underpinning basis of increasing returns (to deployment) mechanism. Alternatively, different policy instruments (social technology) trigger different technological trajectory of a given physical technology. This therefore affords a refined interpretation of energy policy in terms of connecting it to the larger literature of innovation and technical changes. Some future directions are motivated...|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} a fossil fuel tax and research subsidy in directing innovation from fossil fuel toward renewable energy technologies in the electricity sector. Using a global firm-level electricity patent database from 1978 to 2011, we find that the impact of fossil fuel taxes on renewable energy innovation varies with the type of fossil fuel. Specifically, a tax on coal reduces innovation in both fossil fuel and renewable energy technologies while a tax on natural gas has no statistically significant impact on renewable energy innovation. The reason is that easily dispatchable energy sources like coal-fired power plants need to complement renewable energy technologies in the grid because <b>renewables</b> <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> intermittently. Our results suggest that a tax on natural gas, combined with research subsidies for renewable energy, may effectively shift innovation in the electricity sector towards renewable energy. In contrast, coal taxation or a carbon tax that increases coal prices has unintended negative consequences for renewable energy innovation...|$|R
