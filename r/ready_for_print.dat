2500|$|Grabar {{supervised}} another New York exhibition, {{this time}} of icon art, in 1931 and painted a string of official [...] "socialist realism epics" [...] {{but it was the}} 1933 Portrait of Svetlana that gave him an enormous and unwanted exposure at home and abroad. Grabar himself rated this portrait, painted in one day, among its best. The public identified its title subject as none other than Stalin's daughter (born in 1926, she could not have been Grabar's subject; the legend persisted into the 1960s). Either this dangerous publicity, or his earlier association with Natalia Sedova and other trotskyists compelled Grabar to retire to relative obscurity. He kept on painting and wrote his Autobiography that was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>print</b> in June 1935 but was barred from publication until March 1937. Contrary to the communist policy, Autobiography appreciated the [...] "formalist" [...] art of Mir Iskusstva and dismissed [...] "some critics applying Marxist analysis" [...] as utterly incompetent. In the same 1937 Grabar published Ilya Repin that earned him the State Prize four years later and began writing Serov. By 1940 he was firmly back into the Soviet establishment and was featured in propagandist newsreels produced for distribution in Nazi Germany.|$|E

Some monks of the Congregation of St.-Maur refused to submit to the Bull Unigenitus which was directed against Pasquier Quesnel. Bouquet submitted after some hesitation. When, however, Cardinal De Bissy required the monks of St.-Germain-des-Prés to sign a formula of submission he had drawn up, Bouquet and seven others refused their signature because De Bissy, being merely Abbot in commendam of St.-Germain-des-Prés, had no spiritual jurisdiction over the monks.|$|E
50|$|In 1933, one of {{the more}} famous bits of Indy 500 nostalgia occurred. Telegraph was still being used to {{transmit}} race information to newspapers and other outlets across the United States. George Zanaon, a typesetter for The World-Independent newspaper in the town of Walsenburg, Colorado was preparing a story for that day's Indianapolis 500. Since Memorial Day was a holiday, his young editor John B. Kirkpatrick was alone monitoring the Associated Press wire for race updates. The race took several hours to complete, and the AP wire was shut down prior to the finish. Fitzpatrick had nearly the entire story <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>print,</b> minus the winner of the race.

As with the 1973 show, no particular theme was selected for exhibition. However, the 1974 exhibition was given the subject of women in comics, as main characters and as authors. This show was an enormous success, drawing attention from the mass media. Special guests Oriana Fallaci and Natalia Aspesi wrote articles in their respective newspapers, and RAI (Italy's national public broadcasting company) reported on the exhibition on national television.|$|E

50|$|In Rush's account, the {{trustees}} met at Varick's house in July 1820 {{and decided to}} pursue the ordination of black ministers, allowing Zion to dispense with white ministers. Varick must have been coming to the fore in church affairs earlier than this, but his name does not appear on early documents. A general meeting of the church on August 11, 1820 resulted in two decisions: a refusal to join Allen and a refusal to return to white control. The problem of elders for the separate church now became crucial. On September 13, 1820, Abraham Thompson and James Varick were selected by the congregation to become elders {{and they began to}} act immediately, holding communion services. A book of discipline for the new church was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>printing</b> by November 1. The denomination acquired churches outside of New York City, but its growth did not match that of Richard Allen’s group.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{issues of}} [...] "The Silver Age" [...] appeared, but Eclipse went {{bankrupt}} in 1994, ceasing publication of Miracleman with issue #24. Issue #25 was completed, but never printed.

Most of {{the first issue of}} Miracleman: Triumphant was complete and <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>printing,</b> and the second was scripted, but like Miracleman #25 the two issues would remain in publishing limbo after the collapse of Eclipse. #23 and #24 saw the resurrection of Young Miracleman and described the beginnings of trouble in Miracleman's idyllic world. A few pages of issue #25 were leaked to various websites, and appeared in George Khoury's book Kimota! The Miracleman Companion.

25|$|Authors were {{increasingly}} expected to submit manuscripts in a standardised format and style. From 1896, they {{were encouraged to}} submit typed papers on foolscap-folio-sized paper to lighten the work of getting papers <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>printing,</b> and to reduce the chance of error in the process. A publishable paper now had to present its information in an appropriate manner, {{as well as being}} of remarkable scientific interest. For a brief period between 1907 and 1914, authors were under even more pressure to conform to the society's expectations, due to a decision to discuss cost estimates of candidate papers alongside referees' reports. The committees could require authors {{to reduce the number of}} illustrations or tables or, indeed, the overall length of the paper, as a condition of acceptance. It was hoped that this policy would reduce the still-rising costs of production, which had reached £1747 in 1906; but the effect appears to have been negligible, and the cost estimates ceased to be routine practice after 1914.|$|R

40|$|The ArchAIDE {{project is}} a Horizon 2020 project that has the main goal to {{digitally}} support the day-to-day operations {{on the field of}} archaeologists. This allows them to reduce time and costs of delivering an accurate and quick classification of ancient pottery artifacts. To effectively reach such ambitious goal, the project has several sub-goals: (semi-) automatic digitalization of archaeological catalogs, a mobile app to be used on site for live classification of sherds with the generation of a complete potsherds identity card (<b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>print),</b> and an on-line database with real-time visualization of data.

40|$|The present paper aims at {{stressing}} {{the need for}} applied linguistics in dealing with didactic and lexicographical instruments, {{not only in the}} traditional manner, but also – or mainly – in the novel modalities suggested and allowed by the new information and communication technologies, concepts and devices. Proceeding from the contrastive and didactic view of the lexicon and the lexicographer’s task, and also taking advantage of the various models that good learner’s dictionaries in use have already set, the author presents the main aspects involved by compiling a complex, grammaticized Romanian-English dictionary – in fact, one of a larger series projected. In such a complex / grammaticized Romanian-English dictionary, meant as a polyfunctional, flexible, ready-to-use tool of learning, based on an interconnective approach blending the semantic description proper and the grammatical regimen, every relevant item is explained in terms of grammatical usage, and relevant diverging data about morphological markers and irregularities, collocation and syntactic rules, pronunciation, spelling are provided, {{as well as a number}} of frequent Romanian proper names with their English equivalents. To do that, an accessible code-system was used. The material that was used as illustrations in the present approach was provided by the author’s experience as a lexicographer and teacher. Similarly, the development is proposed of interactive, software implements usable by advanced students, and also by translators and teachers of ESL; such devices can be a valuable help, a kind of learn-while-working instruments, combining the classical dictionary and the grammar manual, plus the efficiency and rapidity of modern ICT. After mentioning and illustrating the main problems related to the lexicon within the field of TEFL (viz. contrastive semantics, collocation, anomalous grammatical forms, divergent spelling and pronunciation, divergent phraseological and syntactic structures, idiom, proper nouns, lexical and semantic fields, synonymy and related terms), the author goes on to present the main priorities implied by the complex dictionary mentioned above (which is <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>print),</b> and then a synopsis of the experience represented by the compilation of a pair of pocket-size bilingual dictionaries, and the main aspects of the activity in the field of applied linguistics that is involved by the lexicographer’s efforts. To this were added similar illustrations, the fruits of the author’s personal experience and reflective writing, meant to provide part of the database usable for furthering this didactic endeavour. ...|$|E

The system will contain information about specimens, persons, literature, taxa, and nomenclature. LBASE can serve many functions such as generating literature/nomenclature headings above descriptions, identification lists, listings of vernacular names, distribution maps, etc; but also administrative functions for library and collection maintenance. Data capture will be from existing databases, current revisions, and new/loan material. Data from earlier revisions will only be added if additional funding becomes available. In the future LBASE may grow {{into some kind of}} expert system with possibilities for automatic descriptions, key-construction, and (on-line) facilities for identification.
