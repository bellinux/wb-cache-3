50|$|The PB {{theory is}} that child development, besides its {{physical}} growth, consists of the learning of <b>repertoires</b> {{some of which are}} basic in the sense they provide the behaviors for many life situations and also they determine what and how well the individual can learn. That theory states that humans are unique in having a building type of learning, cumulative learning, in which basic <b>repertoires</b> enable the child to learn other <b>repertoires</b> that enable the learning of other <b>repertoires.</b> Learning language, for example, enables the child to learn various other <b>repertoires,</b> like reading, number concepts, and grammar. Those <b>repertoires</b> provide the bases for learning other <b>repertoires.</b> For example, reading ability, opens the possibilities for an individual to do things and learn things that a non-reader cannot.|$|R

5|$|The main {{development}} of organ <b>repertoire</b> has progressed {{along with that}} of the organ itself, leading to distinctive national styles of composition. Because organs are commonly found in churches and synagogues, the organ <b>repertoire</b> includes a large amount of sacred music, which is accompanimental (choral anthems, congregational hymns, liturgical elements, etc.) as well as solo in nature (chorale preludes, hymn versets designed for alternatim use, etc.). The organ's secular <b>repertoire</b> includes preludes, fugues, sonatas, organ symphonies, suites, and transcriptions of orchestral works.|$|E

5|$|Both {{male and}} female mockingbirds sing, with the latter being {{generally}} quieter and less vocal. Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continues into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall. Frequency in female singing is more sporadic, as it sings less often {{in the summer and}} fall, and only sings when the male is away from the territory. The mockingbird also possesses a large song <b>repertoire</b> that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region. <b>Repertoire</b> sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas, and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200, approximately. It continually expands its <b>repertoire</b> during its life, though it pales in comparison to mimids such as the brown thrasher.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} the <b>repertoires</b> that the teachers draw from when writing a course syllabus. • Design/Methodology: To achieve this a syllabus of a course is scrutinised by using discourse analysis, namely interpretative <b>repertoires.</b> • Results: Two distinct <b>repertoires</b> are identified which the teacher draw from. By employing these <b>repertoires</b> the opposing demands from the students and regulatory bodies as well as the traditional role of the teacher, the teachers maintain their position. By using language the teachers are able to maintain the traditional roles of teacher and student, thus reinforce the existing system. • Limitations: The study uses only one syllabus as its data, thus limiting the potential generalizability of the findings. • Research/Practical Implications: Results show how the teachers use rather paradoxical <b>repertoires</b> to maintain their position and reinforce the existing system. • Originality/Value: The results show that even on a syllabus the teachers have to maintain their position when confronted with demands from students and regulatory bodies, and employ paradoxical <b>repertoires</b> to do so...|$|R

40|$|Open source {{enterprise}} resource planning (OS-ERP) {{systems have}} been gaining recognition {{in the last few}} years.

This paper looks at an early paper on an OS-ERP system, targeting both practitioners and researchers, to identify the <b>repertoires</b> used to argue for the adoption of the said system. To achieve this aim the paper is evaluated by using a strain of discourse analysis - interpretative <b>repertoires.</b> Three distinct <b>repertoires</b> are identified that are used to argue for the unique value gained by adopting the OS-ERP in question, by both highlighting positive aspects of the system, as well as alluding the pitfalls of other systems. These <b>repertoires</b> are also mapped to the existing literature on diffusion of innovations and resource based view to highlight how the existing ideas are reformulated in the identified <b>repertoires...</b>|$|R
5|$|In France, organ music {{developed}} during the Baroque era through the music of Jean Titelouze, François Couperin, and Nicolas de Grigny. Because the French organ of the 17th and early 18th centuries was very standardized, a conventional set of registrations developed for its <b>repertoire.</b> The music of French composers (and Italian composers such as Girolamo Frescobaldi) was written for use during the Mass. Very little secular organ music was composed in France and Italy during the Baroque period; the written <b>repertoire</b> is almost exclusively intended for liturgical use. In England, composers such as John Blow and John Stanley wrote multi-sectional free works for liturgical use called voluntaries through the 19th century.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ways in which a group of women {{construct}} their gender identities in contemporary Japanese society. Critical discursive psychology (Edley, 2001; Wetherell, 1998) was used to investigate the interpretative <b>repertoires</b> (Potter & Wetherell, 1987) these women drew on as they constructed their gender identities. The interpretative <b>repertoires</b> that were identified in their talk about managing domestic and non-domestic responsibilities are presented for analysis. The participants assumed different subject positions in relation to these <b>repertoires</b> as they managed the ideological dilemmas (Billig, Condor, Edwards, Gane, Middleton & Radley, 1988) that emerged from the contradictions between these <b>repertoires.</b> The results of the analysis suggest that modern women face a difficult task as they carefully manage these dilemmas and construct identities from the interpretative resources circulating in Japanese society...|$|R
40|$|Equal {{opportunities}} for {{children are in}} general regarded as crucial; nevertheless, children are still often treated differently due to their sex. This could limit a child's inherent way of expressing him/herself. Nurses {{need to be aware}} of how gender constructions influence their interactions with children. The aim of this study was to illuminate interpretative <b>repertoires</b> that a group of nurses use when communicating with children during blood test procedures in two children's hospitals in Sweden. Data was collected by semi-structured observations of nurses conducting blood test procedures on children, and the observations were analyzed using discourse psychology. Two main groups of interpretative <b>repertoires</b> were found. In one group the <b>repertoires</b> were supporting gender stereotyping and in the other group the <b>repertoires</b> were weakening gender stereotyping. In conclusion, nurses' interactions with children during procedures offer the children different socially and culturally constructed interpretative <b>repertoires</b> about gender. Increased consciousness of gender issues is needed among nurses to enable children to be and act freely, without being forced into limited gendered expectations...|$|R
40|$|This study {{identifies}} and categorizes {{the discursive}} <b>repertoires</b> used by 9 - 10 year old children in Sweden and England during {{discussions about the}} socio-scientific issue of global warming. School science is a community of practice where student identities and discourses can be expressed and developed, and the research focuses on how the use of <b>repertoires</b> {{is related to the}} identities the students express in their discussions. It explores what <b>repertoires</b> become important in the discussions, which identities the students express, and what differences there are between children’s discussions in Sweden and England. The children discussed four possible options that a government might consider to help reduce global warming. Findings indicate that children in both countries use a range of similar <b>repertoires</b> when discussing global warming. When these <b>repertoires</b> are in conflict with each other, students have to ‘renegotiate’ their own identities. Socio-economic status appears to {{have an effect on the}} intensity and depth of argument in the Swedish schools, whereas in the English schools the level and quality of argument seemed to be more closely connected to children’s familiarity with a discursive classroom environment. Young children seem capable of applying a variety of arguments that are logical to them according to the <b>repertoire(s)</b> they employ, but we must encourage changes to pedagogical practice that enable all children to engage in such socio-scientific discussions...|$|R
