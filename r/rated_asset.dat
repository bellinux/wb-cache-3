50|$|One {{reason may}} be {{maturity}} mismatches. For instance, suppose a company is earning 5% on an asset supporting a liability on which it is paying 3.5%. The asset matures in three years while the liability matures in ten. In three years, the firm will have to reinvest the proceeds from the <b>asset.</b> If interest <b>rates</b> decrease, it could end up reinvesting at 3%. For the remaining seven years, it would earn 3% on the new asset while continuing to pay 3.5% on the original liability. Repricing risk also occurs with floating <b>rate</b> <b>assets</b> or liabilities. If fixed <b>rate</b> <b>assets</b> are financed with floating rate liabilities, the rate payable on the liabilities may rise while the rate earned on the assets remains constant.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Smart grid {{solutions}} for the energy distribution industry are receiving significant attention globally {{as a means for}} improving the efficiency and reliability of the electrical power grid. These solutions infuse intelligent monitoring and control devices throughout the distribution network to report on electrical properties such as voltage, current and power, as well as raising network alarms and events. A further aspect of the smart grid embodies the dynamic <b>rating</b> of electrical <b>assets</b> of the network. This fundamentally involves a rating of the load current capacity of electrical assets including cables, transformers and switches. The mainstream approach to <b>rate</b> <b>assets</b> is to apply the vendor plate rating, which often under utilizes assets, or in some cases over utilizes when environmental conditions reduce the effective rated capacity, potentially reducing lifetime. Using active intelligence we have developed a rating system that <b>rates</b> <b>assets</b> in real time based upon several events. This allows for a far more efficient and reliable electrical grid that is able to extend further the life and reliability of the electrical network. In this paper we describe our systems architecture, the observations made during development of the solution, and illustrate how this solution blends with the smart grid by proposing a dynamic rating system for the smart grid.

Several factors appear to have driven movements in equilibrium real exchange rates in the Baltics {{since the start of the}} transition process. In the earlier years of transition, price liberalization, increased demand for services and other nontradables, and shifts in domestic production and exports toward higher valued-added products contributed to real appreciation through higher measured inflation. The strength of the real appreciation during these years appears to also reflect the correction of an initial undervaluation of exchange rates.
