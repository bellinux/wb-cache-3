5|$|Observation of Neptune in the <b>radio-frequency</b> band {{shows that}} it is a source of both {{continuous}} emission and irregular bursts. Both sources are thought to originate from its rotating magnetic field. In the infrared part of the spectrum, Neptune's storms appear bright against the cooler background, allowing {{the size and shape of}} these features to be readily tracked.|$|E
5|$|Spacecraft {{communications}} {{included a}} command subsystem operating at 154.2 and 2106.4MHz and a PCM narrow-band telemetry subsystem, operating at 2287.5 and 137.86MHz, for spacecraft housekeeping, attitude, and sensor performance data. Video {{data from the}} three-camera RBV system was transmitted in both real-time and tape recorder modes at 2265.5MHz, while information from the MSS was constrained to a 20MHz <b>radio-frequency</b> bandwidth at 2229.5MHz.|$|E
5|$|Anfield {{comprises}} 54,074 seats {{split between}} four stands: the Anfield Road end, the Kenny Dalglish Stand, the Kop, and the Main Stand. The Anfield Road end and Kenny Dalglish Stand are two-tiered, while the Kop is a single-tiered and the Main Stand a three-tiered. Entry {{to the stadium}} is gained by <b>radio-frequency</b> identification (RFID) smart cards rather than the traditional manned turnstile. This system, used in all 80turnstiles around Anfield, was introduced in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} oxide of {{samarium}} is the sesquioxide Sm2O3. As many other samarium compounds, {{it exists in}} several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt. The melting point of Sm2O3 is rather high (2345°C) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating, but with induction heating, through a <b>radio-frequency</b> coil. The Sm2O3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method (Verneuil process) from the Sm2O3 powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal Sm2O3 to 1900°C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase. Cubic Sm2O3 has also been described.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{applications}} {{that do not}} need to lock the carrier–envelope offset frequency to a <b>radio-frequency</b> signal. These include, among others, optical communications, the synthesis of optical arbitrary waveforms, spectroscopy (especially dual-comb spectroscopy) or <b>radio-frequency</b> photonics.|$|E
25|$|No <b>radio-frequency</b> {{interference}} {{to existing}} radio communication such as Wi-Fi and cell phones.|$|E

25|$|The BJT is {{also the}} choice for {{demanding}} analog circuits, especially for very-high-frequency applications, such as <b>radio-frequency</b> circuits for wireless systems.|$|E
25|$|Inductive-capacitive (LC) coupled amplifier, using {{a network}} of {{inductors}} and capacitors: This kind of amplifier is most often used in selective <b>radio-frequency</b> circuits.|$|E
25|$|The tags {{contain a}} {{microchip}} which uses <b>radio-frequency</b> identification (RFID) technology. Physically, the tag resembles a DART-Tag, as {{used to pay}} the tolls on the Dartford Crossing. However, the two systems do not interoperate.|$|E
25|$|In March 2007 Qinetiq {{spun off}} a new company, Omni-ID, Ltd, for commercialising passive UHF <b>radio-frequency</b> {{identification}} (RFID) tags. The MoD sold its remaining 18.9% holding in September 2008 at 206p per share, raising £254m. The government retained its 'special share', giving it control over any potential takeover.|$|E
25|$|An optical {{frequency}} comb {{can be generated}} by modulating the amplitude and/or phase of a continuous-wave laser with an external modulator driven by a <b>radio-frequency</b> source. In this manner, the frequency comb is centered around the {{optical frequency}} provided by the continuous-wave laser and the modulation frequency or repetition rate is given by the external <b>radio-frequency</b> source. The advantage of this method {{is that it can}} reach much higher repetition rates (>10GHz) than with mode-locked lasers and the two degrees of freedom of the comb can be set independently. The number of lines is lower than with a mode-locked laser (typically a few tens), but the bandwidth can be significantly broadened with nonlinear fibers. This type of optical frequency comb is usually called electrooptic frequency comb. The first schemes used a phase modulator inside an integrated Fabry–Perot cavity, but with advances in electro-optic modulators new arrangements are possible.|$|E
25|$|On 14 May 1976 Fermilab {{took its}} protons {{all the way}} to 500GeV. This {{achievement}} provided the opportunity to introduce a new energy scale, the teraelectronvolt (TeV), equal to 1000GeV. On 17 June of that year, the European Super Proton Synchrotron accelerator (SPS) had achieved an initial circulating proton beam (with no accelerating <b>radio-frequency</b> power) of only 400 GeV.|$|E
25|$|The {{wide and}} general {{applicability}} of the Laplace transform and its inverse is illustrated by an application in astronomy which provides some information on the spatial distribution of matter of an astronomical source of <b>radio-frequency</b> thermal radiation too distant to resolve {{as more than a}} point, given its flux density spectrum, rather than relating the time domain with the spectrum (frequency domain).|$|E
25|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} is a {{minimally invasive}} treatments for fibroids. In this technique the fibroid is shrunk by inserting a needle-like device into the fibroid through the abdomen and heating it with <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) electrical energy to cause necrosis of cells. The treatment {{is a potential}} option for women who have fibroids, have completed child-bearing and want to avoid a hysterectomy.|$|E
25|$|Using {{sensor data}} as input, Hodges and Pollack {{designed}} machine learning-based systems for identifying individuals as they perform routine daily {{activities such as}} making coffee. Intel Research (Seattle) Lab and University of Washington at Seattle have done some important works on using sensors to detect human plans. Some of these works infer user transportation modes from readings of <b>radio-frequency</b> identifiers (RFID) and global positioning systems (GPS).|$|E
25|$|Lightning {{discharges}} {{generate a}} wide range of electromagnetic radiations, including <b>radio-frequency</b> pulses. The times at which a pulse from a given lightning discharge arrives at several receivers can be used to locate the source of the discharge. The United States federal government has constructed a nationwide grid of such lightning detectors, allowing lightning discharges to be tracked in real time throughout the continental U.S.|$|E
25|$|Stealth mode avoids {{detection}} using {{a variety}} of stealth technologies that reduce reflection/emission of radar, infrared, visible light, <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) spectrum, and audio; the car's lights and main engine are deactivated; the vehicle is powered by an auxiliary electric motor. This makes the car very hard to find at night or in dark places, and as demonstrated by the car chase in Batman Begins, can easily throw off pursuers.|$|E
25|$|RFID tags contain {{at least}} three parts: an {{integrated}} circuit for storing and processing information that modulates and demodulates a <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) signals; a means of collecting DC power from the incident reader signal; and an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal. The tag information is stored in a non-volatile memory. The RFID tag includes either fixed or programmable logic for processing the transmission and sensor data, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Data in a {{passport}} chip is scannable by electronic readers, a capability which {{is intended to}} speed up immigration processing. A passport {{does not have to}} be plugged into a reader in order for the data to be read. Like toll-road chips, data in passport chips can be read when passport chips are proximate to readers. The passport cover contains a <b>radio-frequency</b> shield, so the cover must be opened for the data to be read.|$|E
25|$|Pitt {{is home to}} the Gertrude E. and John M. Petersen Institute of NanoScience and Engineering, {{which was}} ranked second in the nation in 2006 for {{microscale}} and nanoscale research by the leading global trade publication, Small Times. Pitt also has a recognized program in <b>Radio-frequency</b> identification device (RFID) technology, with its research program rated among the top three in the world along with MIT and the University of Cambridge in England.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, certain myths are not tested due {{to various}} {{objections}} by Discovery Channel or their advertisers, most notably myths pertaining to <b>radio-frequency</b> identification (RFID) vulnerability. Through nine seasons, {{a total of}} 2,391 experiments were performed and 12 tons of explosives were used to test 769 myths. The team has also expressed reluctance to test conspiracy theory myths such as the JFK assassination or 9/11 conspiracies, although they have tested some of the conspiracy theories relating to the Apollo Moon landings.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} Caltech has {{actively}} promoted {{the commercialization of}} technologies developed within its walls. Through its Office of Technology Transfer & Corporate Partnerships, scientific breakthroughs {{have led to the}} transfer of numerous technologies {{in a wide variety of}} scientific-related fields such as photovoltaic, <b>radio-frequency</b> identification (RFID), semiconductors, hyperspectral imaging, electronic devices, protein design, solid state amplifiers and many more. Companies such as Contour Energy Systems, Impinj, Fulcrum Microsystems, Nanosys, Inc., Photon etc., Xencor, Wavestream Wireless have emerged from Caltech.|$|E
25|$|When a {{radio wave}} reaches the ionosphere, the {{electric}} {{field in the}} wave forces the electrons in the ionosphere into oscillation at the same frequency as the radio wave. Some of the <b>radio-frequency</b> energy is given up to this resonant oscillation. The oscillating electrons will then either be lost to recombination or will re-radiate the original wave energy. Total refraction can occur when the collision frequency of the ionosphere {{is less than the}} radio frequency, and if the electron density in the ionosphere is great enough.|$|E
25|$|The {{department}} {{today is}} home to The CAVE. This project is a virtual reality room used for everything from three-dimensional drawing classes to tours of the circulatory system for medical students. In 2000 students from Brown's Technology House converted the south face of the Sciences Library into a Tetris game, the first high-rise-building Tetris ever attempted. Code named La Bastille, the game used a personal computer running Linux, a <b>radio-frequency</b> video game controller, eleven circuit boards, a 12-story data network, and over 10,000 Christmas lights.|$|E
25|$|An NMR {{spectrometer}} typically {{consists of}} a spinning sample-holder inside a very strong magnet, a <b>radio-frequency</b> emitter and a receiver with a probe (an antenna assembly) that goes inside the magnet to surround the sample, optionally gradient coils for diffusion measurements and electronics to control the system. Spinning the sample is necessary to average out diffusional motion. Whereas, measurements of diffusion constants (diffusion ordered spectroscopy or DOSY) are done the sample stationary and spinning off, and flow cells {{can be used for}} online analysis of process flows.|$|E
25|$|An FM signal {{can also}} be used to carry a stereo signal; this is done with {{multiplexing}} and demultiplexing before and after the FM process. The FM modulation and demodulation process is identical in stereo and monaural processes. A high-efficiency <b>radio-frequency</b> switching amplifier can be used to transmit FM signals (and other constant-amplitude signals). For a given signal strength (measured at the receiver antenna), switching amplifiers use less battery power and typically cost less than a linear amplifier. This gives FM another advantage over other modulation methods requiring linear amplifiers, such as AM and QAM.|$|E
25|$|On August 9, 2004, Target {{announced}} to their suppliers {{that they were}} going to perform a trial on the effects of <b>radio-frequency</b> identification on the efficiency of supply chain management in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. This trial involved one Target distribution center and ten nearby Target stores. Here, RFID tags would be placed on the bar codes of pallets and cartons to track the goods from the suppliers to the distribution center, and from the distribution center to the stores. As of 2009, RFID had been phased out of the Dallas–Fort Worth stores.|$|E
25|$|Low-impedance {{microphones}} are preferred {{over high}} impedance for two reasons: {{one is that}} using a high-impedance microphone with a long cable results in high frequency signal loss due to cable capacitance, which forms a low-pass filter with the microphone output impedance. The other is that long high-impedance cables tend to pick up more hum (and possibly <b>radio-frequency</b> interference (RFI) as well). Nothing is damaged if the impedance between microphone and other equipment is mismatched; the worst that happens is a reduction in signal or change in frequency response.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radio-frequency</b> {{identification}} (RFID) uses {{electromagnetic fields}} to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. The tags contain electronically stored information. Passive tags collect energy {{from a nearby}} RFID reader's interrogating radio waves. Active tags have a local power source (such as a battery) and may operate hundreds of meters from the RFID reader. Unlike a barcode, the tag need not be within the line {{of sight of the}} reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method for Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC).|$|E
25|$|In a triode <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) amplifier, if {{both the}} plate (anode) and grid are {{connected}} to resonant circuits tuned to the same frequency, stray capacitive coupling between the grid and the plate will cause the amplifier to go into oscillation if the stage gain {{is much more than}} unity. In early designs, dozens (in some cases over 100) low-gain triode stages had to be connected in cascade to make workable equipment, which drew enormous amounts of power in operation and required a team of maintenance engineers. The strategic value was so high, however, that the British Admiralty felt the high cost was justified.|$|E
25|$|Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) {{sources are}} used {{primarily}} for cation {{analysis of a}} wide array of sample types. In this source, a plasma that is electrically neutral overall, but that has had a substantial fraction of its atoms ionized by high temperature, is used to atomize introduced sample molecules and to further strip the outer electrons from those atoms. The plasma is usually generated from argon gas, since the first ionization energy of argon atoms is higher than the first of any other elements except He, O, F and Ne, but lower than the second ionization energy of all except the most electropositive metals. The heating is achieved by a <b>radio-frequency</b> current passed through a coil surrounding the plasma.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} risk to {{participants}} in an fMRI study is claustrophobia {{and there are}} reported risks for pregnant women {{to go through the}} scanning process. Scanning sessions also subject participants to loud high-pitched noises from Lorentz forces induced in the gradient coils by the rapidly switching current in the powerful static field. The gradient switching can also induce currents in the body causing nerve tingling. Implanted medical devices such as pacemakers could malfunction because of these currents. The <b>radio-frequency</b> field of the excitation coil may heat up the body, and this has to be monitored more carefully in those running a fever, the diabetic, and those with circulatory problems. Local burning from metal necklaces and other jewellery is also a risk.|$|E
25|$|As of 2014, {{the first}} stage in the {{acceleration}} process (pre-accelerator injector) takes place in two ion sources which turn hydrogen gas into H− ions. The gas is introduced into a container lined with molybdenum electrodes, each a matchbox-sized, oval-shaped cathode and a surrounding anode, separated by 1mm and {{held in place by}} glass ceramic insulators. A magnetron generates a plasma to form the ions near the metal surface. The ions are accelerated by the source to 35keV and matched by low energy beam transport (LEBT) into the <b>radio-frequency</b> quadrupole (RFQ) which applies a 750keV electrostatic field giving the ions their second acceleration. At the exit of RFQ, the beam is matched by medium energy beam transport (MEBT) into the entrance of the linear accelerator (linac).|$|E
25|$|In {{semiconductor}} {{research and}} industry, PMMA aids as a resist in the {{electron beam lithography}} process. A solution consisting of the polymer in a solvent is used to spin coat silicon and other semiconducting and semi-insulating wafers with a thin film. Patterns on this {{can be made by}} an electron beam (using an electron microscope), deep UV light (shorter wavelength than the standard photolithography process), or X-rays. Exposure to these creates chain scission or (de-cross-linking) within the PMMA, allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer, making it a positive photoresist. PMMA's advantage is that it allows for extremely high resolution patterns to be made. Smooth PMMA surface can be easily nanostructured by treatment in oxygen <b>radio-frequency</b> plasma and nanostructured PMMA surface can be easily smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation.|$|E
