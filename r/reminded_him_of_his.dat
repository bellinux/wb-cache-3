5|$|The role of Lord W. C. Jackson {{was portrayed}} by C. R. Parthiban, while M. R. Santhanam played the minister, Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai. Kattabomman's {{daughter}} in the film, Meena, was a fictional character created by Krishnasamy. She was based on Krishnasamy's own daughter, Mynavathi, who {{died when she was}} five years old. Krishnasamy initially refused to include the scene involving Meena's death as it <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> daughter, but finally did so reluctantly. The character was played by Baby Kanchana.|$|E
5|$|Pandora– An {{animated}} {{creation of}} Hephaestus who became like a {{daughter to the}} god, and was neither living nor dead. Pandora was imprisoned in the labyrinth by Zeus when he was infected by the fear released from Pandora's Box. Kratos rescued Pandora after he learned {{that she was the}} key to pacifying the Flame of Olympus that surrounded Pandora's Box. Kratos reluctantly allowed Pandora to sacrifice herself to open the Box and mourned her death, as Pandora <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> deceased child Calliope. Pandora reappeared in Kratos' psyche and helped him find the power of hope locked deep inside himself, which allowed him to overcome and kill Zeus. The character was voiced by Natalie Lander in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers {{of what was to}} lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E

5|$|In October 37 AD, Caligula fell seriously ill, {{or perhaps}} was poisoned. He soon {{recovered}} from his illness, but many {{believed that the}} illness turned the young emperor toward the diabolical: he started to kill off or exile those who were close to him or whom he saw as a serious threat. Perhaps his illness <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mortality and of the desire of others to advance into his place. He had his cousin and adopted son Tiberius Gemellus executed – an act that outraged Caligula's and Gemellus's mutual grandmother Antonia Minor. She {{is said to have}} committed suicide, although Suetonius hints that Caligula actually poisoned her. He had his father-in-law Marcus Junius Silanus and his brother-in-law Marcus Lepidus executed as well. His uncle Claudius was spared only because Caligula preferred to keep him as a laughing stock. His favourite sister Julia Drusilla died in 38 AD of a fever: his other two sisters, Livilla and Agrippina the Younger, were exiled. He hated being the grandson of Agrippa and slandered Augustus by repeating a falsehood that his mother was actually conceived as the result of an incestuous relationship between Augustus and his daughter Julia the Elder.|$|E
5|$|Although Kratos killed Poseidon, he was {{abandoned}} by Gaia when his {{first encounter with}} Zeus went poorly. Stranded in the Underworld and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans, Kratos learned from the spirit of Athena, who also provided the Blades of Exile, {{that he needed to}} find the Flame of Olympus, which is the key to defeating Zeus. Kratos murdered both Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims as he sought the Flame. Realizing the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora's Box (engulfed by the Flame) is Pandora herself, Kratos came to care for Pandora, who <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lost daughter Calliope. Kratos showed humanity when he attempted to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench the Flame, but reluctantly allowed the act when she said there was no other option. Finding the box empty, and driven berserk by Zeus' mockery, Kratos attacked his father. Although Gaia interrupted and tried to kill Kratos and Zeus, she was destroyed by Kratos, who then apparently defeated Zeus. Zeus returned in spirit form and attacked Kratos, who retreated into his psyche. Kratos forgave himself for his past sins with the help of Lysandra. Pandora later appeared and told Kratos that hope would save him. Kratos was revived and easily destroyed Zeus. Athena confronted Kratos and demanded that he return the power of hope; the contents of Pandora's Box. In a selfless act, Kratos refused, stated his need for vengeance was gone and impaled himself with the Blade of Olympus, which dispersed the power across the world for mankind's use. Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removed the Blade and departed as Kratos collapsed next to the Blade of Olympus. The post-credits scene showed a trail of blood leading away from the Blade with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.|$|E
25|$|Ali (son of Hussein), {{had great}} respect for his uncle Abbas. He often wept when his eyes fell on Ubaidullah, {{explaining}} that he <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's heroic and tragic exploit on that day in Karbala.|$|E

25|$|After making several {{appearances}} with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in 2002 and 2003, Bagwell {{returned to}} TNA on the April 27, 2006 episode of Impact! {{as the first}} of Sting's possible tag team partners for Sacrifice on May 14. Bagwell also appeared on the September 28 episode of Impact! in several segments, including a press conference, a video package, and a live segment where he briefly brawled with Jeff Jarrett. At a 2008 live event in Florida, Bagwell expressed {{that he would have}} liked to work a deal with TNA because it <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> days in WCW.|$|E
25|$|Kinji Fukasaku {{stated that}} he decided to direct the film because the novel it was adapted from <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time as a 15-year-old munitions factory worker during World War II. At that time, his class was made to work in a munitions factory. In July 1945, the factory came under {{artillery}} fire. The children could not escape so they dived under each other for cover. The surviving members of the class had to dispose of the corpses. At that point, Fukasaku realised that the Japanese government was lying about World War II, and he developed a burning hatred of adults in general that he maintained for a long time afterwards.|$|E
25|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 1960s, Presley made films that relied heavily on exotic locations and mundane songs, and he was tied into contracts that he could not escape. Parker did not care if the films were good or bad but only about the profits. When Presley complained to him that he wanted better scripts, Parker <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lavish lifestyle and that risking $1 million a year for doing practically no work was dangerous. Presley's career stagnated while artists like the Beatles, the Supremes, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan dominated the charts. Parker admitted in 1983 that after 1966, the income from Presley films and soundtracks was dramatically reduced.|$|E

25|$|At this time, John Canan and Ralph Kilbourne {{went back}} to Joseph Gale and <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> promise to assist on the project and serve as captain once they got further along in the building. Gale then went and {{inspected}} the ship to determine {{if it would be}} seaworthy, and after determining it was, he went home and sold his farm and farming equipment. After moving his family to Champoeg, Oregon, Gale then devoted much of the next year to completing the vessel. On May 19, 1841 the partially completed vessel was launched and moved up the Willamette River to near Oregon City. In the fall of 1841, George Davis and Henry Woods dropped out of the project, which reduced the number of partners to five. Kilbourne and Gale did most of the remaining work, while Thomas J. Hubbard did the blacksmithing.|$|E
25|$|In the 2006 season, {{driving for}} Penske, Busch scored one win at Bristol Motor Speedway in the Food City 500, his fifth win at the track. Busch celebrated the victory by {{getting out of}} his car and making a snow angel on the track, due to snow that had fallen at the track that weekend. He also won six poles and had seven top fives and twelve top ten {{finishes}} but finished 16th in the final standings. He also made his Busch Series debut for Penske in the No. 39 Dodge at Texas Motor Speedway, winning in his first race. He ran six more races that season and picked up a second win at Watkins Glen International by holding off Robby Gordon on the final lap. Gordon and Busch on the final lap struggled for the win but it resulted in Busch holding onto the lead in the outer-loop to seal up the win. In victory circle Busch thanked Gordon for a fight for victory and said that the struggle <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 at Darlington when Ricky Craven beat Busch by one inch to win the race after a 2 lap-long struggle to the checkers.|$|E
25|$|H. G. Wells was {{the first}} to {{introduce}} the notion of a sea alien in his 1897 short story In the Abyss. The idea for The Abyss came to James Cameron when, at age 17 and in high school, he attended a science lecture about deep sea diving by a man, Francis J. Falejczyk, who {{was the first}} human to breathe fluid through his lungs in experiments conducted by Dr. Johannes A. Kylstra. He subsequently wrote a short story that focused on a group of scientists in a laboratory {{at the bottom of the}} ocean. The basic idea did not change, but many of the details evolved over the years. Once Cameron arrived in Hollywood, he quickly realized that a group of scientists was not that commercial and changed it to a group of blue-collar workers. While making Aliens, Cameron saw a National Geographic film about remote operated vehicles operating deep in the North Atlantic Ocean. These images <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> short story. He and producer Gale Anne Hurd decided that The Abyss would be their next film. Cameron wrote a treatment combined with elements of a shooting script, which generated a lot of interest in Hollywood. He then wrote the script, basing the character of Lindsey on Hurd and finished it by the end of 1987. Cameron and Hurd were married before The Abyss, separated during pre-production, and divorced in February 1989, two months after principal photography.|$|E

[...] Lindelof also {{declared}} that the song [...] "lyrically felt right", and had a haunting feeling due to Mama Cass' personal history.|$|E
500|$|Davidge is a {{longtime}} Halo fan; he would play Combat Evolved during downtime while producing Massive Attack albums in 2001.

500|$|Van Gogh {{claimed the}} {{painting}} as [...] "something funny... I will not create every day." [...] There {{was something about}} the setting for this painting that <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> homeland. [...] He asked his brother Theo to frame an earlier version of the painting in blue and gold (blue in the front, gold on the side) and offer it to an art-dealer in the Netherlands, named Tersteeg. Tersteeg knew Van Gogh and his brother Theo when they lived in The Hague. [...] He nurtured Van Gogh's early artistic interests but their relationship suffered after Van Gogh lived with a prostitute named Sien.|$|E

500|$|Van Gogh was {{influenced}} by Japanese woodcut prints, as evidenced by his simplified use of color to create a harmonious and unified image. [...] Contrasting colors, such as blue and yellow, were used to bring a vibrancy to the works. [...] He painted with an impasto, or thickly applied paint, using color to depict the reflection of light. The subject matter, a drawbridge on a canal, <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> homeland in the Netherlands. He asked his brother Theo to frame and send one of the paintings to an art dealer in the Netherlands. The reconstructed Langlois Bridge is now named Pont Van-Gogh.|$|E
500|$|Hitoshi Sakimoto {{composed}} {{and arranged}} {{most of the}} game's soundtrack, with Hayato Matsuo and Masaharu Iwata creating seven and two tracks respectively.

Sakimoto experienced difficulty following in Uematsu's footsteps, but he decided to create a unique soundtrack in his own way. [...] "Kiss Me Good-Bye" [...] was performed in both English and Japanese by Angela Aki.

500|$|Hitoshi Sakimoto {{composed}} {{most of the}} game's soundtrack; Nobuo Uematsu, {{following his}} departure from Square Enix in 2004, only contributed the theme song, [...] "Kiss Me Good-Bye", sung by Angela Aki. Uematsu noted that Aki's style of playing the keyboard while singing <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> childhood idol, Elton John, {{which was one of}} the reasons he chose her. Aki was approached for the role three years before the release of the game. She based her words for the song on [...] "a scene of a new journey after good-bye", which was the sense she had gotten from Uematsu's melody, and was encouraged by Uematsu not to limit herself in her lyrics to what she thought the producers wanted. Sakimoto was brought in to compose the soundtrack to the game by Yasumi Matsuno, the producer of the game, five months before the game was officially announced. Sakimoto experienced difficulty following in Uematsu's footsteps, but he decided to create a unique soundtrack in his own way, although he cites Uematsu as his biggest musical influence.|$|E
