After being imprisoned in a puzzle box by Grand Master Dashi for 1,500 years, Wuya's physical form was destroyed. Her goal {{is to use the}} Shen Gong Wu to regain a tangible body along with her magical powers, which happens at the end of season one with the help of Raimundo, the Serpent's Tail and the <b>Reversing</b> <b>Mirror.</b> She, like Dojo, has the ability to sense a Shen Gong Wu's appearance, but does not need the Scroll of the Shen Gong Wu to determine what it does. At one point she leaves Jack to take on Raimundo as partner, but after much debate he returns to the path of good.|$|E
5000|$|Self-portraits {{are usually}} {{produced}} {{with the help}} of a mirror, and the finished result is a mirror-image portrait, a reversal of what occurs in a normal portrait when sitter and artist are opposite each other. In a self-portrait, a righted handed artist would appear to be holding a brush in the left hand, unless the artist deliberately corrects the image or uses a second <b>reversing</b> <b>mirror</b> while painting.Occasionally, the client or the client's family is unhappy with the resulting portrait and the artist is obliged to re-touch it or do it over or withdraw from the commission without being paid, suffering the humiliation of failure. Jacques-Louis David celebrated portrait of Madame Récamier, wildly popular in exhibitions, was rejected by the sitter, as was John Singer Sargent's notorious Portrait of Madame X. John Trumbull's full-length portrait, General George Washington at Trenton, was rejected by the committee that commissioned it.

5000|$|In Xiaolin Showdown, {{when more}} than one person grabs a Shen Gong Wu at the same time, a Xiaolin Showdown occurs. In this namesake competition, each side wagers a Shen Gong Wu he/she already owns. In some cases, the {{competitors}} invoke a Shen Yi Bu Dare, where multiple (usually two) Shen Gong Wu are wagered. The winner obtains all the Shen Gong Wu fought for, totaling five Shen Gong Wu. In some cases, {{when more than}} two people touch a Shen Gong Wu at once, a different kind of Xiaolin Showdown occurs: the Showdown Trio is a two-on-one or three-person free-for-all, a Xiaolin Showdown Tsunami is either a two-on-two or a four-person free-for-all Showdown, and an Eight-Way Xiaolin Showdown is a four-on-four Showdown. One can also call for a Cosmic Clash Showdown, allowing the caller to bring more people into the Showdown, who did not touch the Shen Gong Wu (however, in this type of showdown, one of the competitors must be over one-half Shen Gong Wu and look kind of freakish). Generally, the competitors in a Xiaolin Showdown of any type use the Shen Gong Wu that they wagered to compete with. However, there have been instances where a Shen Gong Wu not wagered was used in the Xiaolin Showdown, as in [...] "The Last Temptation of Raimundo" [...] when Wuya used the Shroud of Shadows against the Xiaolin Warriors while she was possessing Raimundo. Another showdown was in [...] "Enter The Dragon" [...] when Omi uses the <b>Reversing</b> <b>Mirror</b> and Shroud of Shadows on Dojo.|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} monocrystals of Bi_ 1 _ 2 SiO_ 2 _ 0 and Bi_ 1 _ 2 TiO_ 2 _ 0 wide-zone semiconductors. The aim of the {{investigation is}} experimental study of two- and four-wave interactions in Bi_ 1 _ 2 SiO_ 2 _ 0 and Bi_ 1 _ 2 TiO_ 2 _ 0 photorefractive crystals, as well as generation processes on their basis. The holographic recording in the crystals being investigated was made on the wavelengths of helium-neon (lambda = 633 nm), argon (lambda = 514 nm), neodynium (lambda = 1, 06 microm) and semiconductor (lambda = 0, 85 microm) lasers.

40|$|Abstract. Facial {{expression}} {{perception and}} production are crucial for social functioning. Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are impaired {{in their ability}} to produce and perceive dynamic facial expressions, which may contribute to social deficits. Here we present a novel intervention system for improving facial expression perception and production in children with ASD based on computer vision. We present a live demo of the Emotion Mirror, a game where the children make facial expressions of basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) that are "mirrored " by a cartoon character on the screen who responds dynamically in real-time. In the <b>reverse</b> <b>mirror</b> condition, the character makes an expression and children are rewarded when they successfully copy the expression of the character. This application demonstrates a novel intersection of computer vision and medicine enabled by real-time facial expression processing. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} seismic {{scanning}} tunneling macroscope (SSTM) that can detect {{the presence of}} sub-wavelength scatterers in the near-field of either the source or the receivers. Analytic formulas for the time <b>reverse</b> <b>mirror</b> (TRM) profile associated with a single scatterer model show that the spatial resolution limit to be, unlike the Abbe limit of λ/ 2, independent of wavelength and linearly proportional to the source-scatterer separation {{as long as the}} point scatterer is in the near-field region; if the sub-wavelength scatterer is a spherical impedance discontinuity then the resolution will also be limited by the radius of the sphere. Therefore, superresolution imaging can be achieved as the scatterer approaches the source. This is analogous to an optical scanning tunneling microscope that has sub-wavelength resolution. Scaled to seismic frequencies, it is theoretically possible to extract 100 Hz information from 20 Hz data by imaging of near-field seismic energy...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} theory for {{near-field}} superresolution imaging with surface waves and time <b>reverse</b> <b>mirrors</b> (TRMs). Theoretical formulas and numerical {{results show that}} applying the TRM operation to surface waves in an elastic half-space can achieve superresolution imaging of subwavelength scatterers if they are located less than about 1 / 2 of the shear wavelength from the source line. We also show that the TRM operation for a single frequency is equivalent to natural migration, which uses the recorded data to approximate the Green’s functions for migration, and only costs O(N 4) algebraic operations for poststack migration compared to O(N 6) operations for natural prestack migration. Here, we assume the sources and receivers are on an N × N grid and there are N 2 trial image points on the free surface. Our theoretical predictions of superresolution are validated with tests on synthetic data. The field-data tests suggest that hidden faults at the near surface can be detected with subwavelength imaging of surface waves by using the TRM operation if they are no deeper than about 1 / 2 the dominant shear wavelength...|$|R
40|$|James Belich in {{a recent}} revisionist reading of colonial history, Making Peoples, has argued that Māori did not in fact lose the fierce {{military}} engagements over land between Māori and Pākehā in the 1860 s.

Yet Māori suffered a series of local defeats and the outcome of the wars was disastrous for them. From the 1870 s until the First World War European society in New Zealand, allowing for economic recessions and set-backs, made continuous progress in settling the land, building infrastructure, attracting capital, exporting timber, wool and meat. By {{the turn of the century}} New Zealand was a more comprehensively ‘settled’ country than Australia and a mood of smug satisfaction at their achievements and prospects was widespread among Pākehā.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the role of}} visual-spatial information in stabilizing movement during treadmill locomotion. Methods: Physiological, biomechanical, and psychological indices of coordination stability were recorded while participants were visually coupled with a whole-body image of themselves during treadmill locomotion. Ten participants ran on a treadmill under three visual conditions: two dynamic images (symmetrical, <b>mirror</b> image; asymmetrical, <b>reversed</b> <b>mirror</b> image) and one static. Performance was examined at two speeds. Results: Participants ran more economically (mL·kg·min - 1) when they were visually coupled with a symmetrical rather than with an asymmetrical or static image. An asymmetrical coupling resulted in increased variability in footfall position at the faster speed, {{in comparison to the}} symmetrical and static conditions. However, at slower speeds, footfall variability and frequency were higher under both dynamic visual conditions in comparison to the static control. Changes in metabolic economy (mL·kg·min- 1) were only partially mediated by movement kinematics. Conclusion: Visual information influences treadmill locomotion and associated measures of stability even when there is no intention to coordinate with external stimuli...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an ascheme is {{proposed}} for multiuser underwater acoustic communication {{by using the}} multi-chirp rate signals. It differs from the well known TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) or CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), by assigning each users with different chirp-rate carriers instead of the time, frequency or PN code. Multi-chirp rate signals can be separated from each other by FrFT (Fractional Fourier Transform), which {{can be regarded as}} the chirp-based decomposing, and superior to the match filter in the underwater acoustic channel. VTRM (Virtual Time <b>Reverse</b> <b>Mirror)</b> is applied into the system to alleviate the ISI caused by the multipatch and make the equalization more simple. Results of computer simulations and pool experiments prove that the proposed multiuser underwater acoustic communication based on the multi-chirp rate exhibit well performance.

40|$|Social {{coordination}} {{can provide}} optimal solutions to {{many kinds of}} group dilemmas, and non- human primates {{have been shown to}} perform single actions successively or simultaneously with partners to maximize food rewards in a variety of experimental settings. Less attention has been given to showing how animals are able to produce multiple (rather than single) intermixed and co-regulated actions, even though many species’ signal transmissions and social interactions rely on extended bouts of coordinated turn-taking. Here we report on coordination behaviour in three pairs of chimpanzees (mother/offspring dyads) during an experimentally induced turn-taking scenario. Participants were given a “shared” version of a computer-based serial ordering task that they had previously mastered individually. We found that minimal trial-and-error learning was necessary for the participants to solve the new social version of the task, and that information flow was more pronounced from mothers toward offspring than the <b>reverse,</b> <b>mirroring</b> characteristics of social learning in wild chimpanzees. Our experiment introduces a novel paradigm for studying behavioural coordination in non-humans, able to yield insights into the evolution of turn-taking which underlies a range of social interactions, including communication and language...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of fusion power to space propulsion requires rethinking the engineering-design solution to controlled-fusion energy.

The three candidate terrestrial fusion reactor configurations are: the thermal barrier tandem <b>mirror</b> (TBTM), field <b>reversed</b> <b>mirror</b> (FRM), and levitated dipole field (LDF).
