5000|$|The primary {{difficulty}} with Mach's definition of mass {{is that it}} fails {{to take into account}} the potential energy (or binding energy) needed to bring two masses sufficiently close to one another to perform the measurement of mass. This is most vividly demonstrated by comparing the mass of the proton in the nucleus of deuterium, to the mass of the proton in free space (which is greater by about 0.239% - this is due to the binding energy of deuterium.). Thus, for example, if the <b>reference</b> <b>weight</b> m2 is taken to be the mass of the neutron in free space, and the relative accelerations for the proton and neutron in deuterium are computed, then the above formula over-estimates the mass m1 (by 0.239%) for the proton in deuterium. At best, Mach's formula can only be used to obtain ratios of masses, that is, as m1 /m2 = |a2| / |a1|. An additional difficulty was pointed out by Henri Poincaré, which is that the measurement of instantaneous acceleration is impossible: unlike the measurement of time or distance, there is no way to measure acceleration with a single measurement; one must make multiple measurements (of position, time, etc.) and perform a computation to obtain the acceleration. Poincaré termed this to be an [...] "insurmountable flaw" [...] in the Mach definition of mass.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} sensation of effort in Huntington disease (HD). We tested {{the hypothesis that}} the basal ganglia are involved in processing effort sensation. The experimental paradigm consisted in a contralateral matching procedure where normal subjects (N = 6) and HD patients (N = 6) were required to lift a <b>reference</b> <b>weight</b> with their non-dominant index, and then compare the target-weight with variable weights lifted by the dominant index. Two kinds of sequences were administered: (1) increasing, where the first weight was lighter than the <b>reference</b> <b>weight</b> and progressively increased in 20 g steps, (2) decreasing, where trials started with a heavier weight and progressively decreased. We calculated the discrimination threshold (DT) across sequences as the weight for which the subject’s response changed sign. The difference between the higher and the lower threshold was defined as “uncertain area”. We predicted that controls should overestimate the <b>reference</b> <b>weight</b> lifted by their non-dominant hand because the same effort produces more force when applied to stronger muscles. If the basal ganglia mediates sensation of effort, patients ’ capability to discriminate weights should be degraded. As expected, normal subjects overestimated the <b>reference</b> <b>weight</b> lifted by their non-dominant index and showed a restricted uncertain area, thus, indicating that were able to discriminate minimal differences in generated forces. By contrast, patients with HD underestimated the <b>reference</b> <b>weight</b> lifted by their non-dominant hand and showed a broad uncertain area, thus, demonstrating that they could detect only important differences in the matched efforts. These results suggest that effort sensation critically involves the basal ganglia.

We estimated relationships between actual and perceived weights for the objects lifted with the system by comparing the perceived weights of the power-assist-lifted objects to some <b>reference</b> <b>weights</b> following psychophysics. The results showed that the perceived weights were 40 % of the actual weights. However, the power-assist-lifted objects were constrained objects as they were tied to the force sensor and the objects for <b>reference</b> <b>weights</b> were unconstrained objects, which might affect the accuracy and reliability of the relationships. This is why, we conducted another experiment where we made two objects with identical appearance. One was lifted by humans in constrained condition, and another was lifted in unconstrained condition, and weight perception between the two conditions was compared. The results showed that weight perception for constrained lifting was not much different from that for unconstrained lifting. Results of this experiment validated the psychophysical relationships between actual and perceived weights for the power-assistlifted objects, and also confirmed the accuracy of the relationships. Finally, we proposed to use the findings to develop power assist robots for manipulating heavy objects in industries that would improve interactions between robots and their users...|$|R

40|$|The {{nutritional}} requirements of twin-bearing ewes are ∼ 25 % {{greater than those}} of ewes with single fetuses during late pregnancy and nearly twice those of non-pregnant ewes. Underfeeding ewes, resulting in liveweight loss during late pregnancy, can have adverse effects on the production and survival of both the lamb and the ewe, and improving twin-lamb survival is critical to improving the overall reproductive performance of the National Merino flock. Scanning for pregnancy status and litter size allows for more precise management of the nutrition of the ewe flock according to the different nutritional needs of dry, single- and twin-bearing ewes. In the present paper, we tested the hypothesis that it is profitable to identify pregnancy status and litter size, and the optimum nutrition profiles are different for dry, single- and twin-bearing ewes. We tested this by examining a range of nutrition strategies for flocks where only the dry ewes were identified, or for flocks where the single- and twin-bearing ewes were identified. A MIDAS model {{set up for the}} Hamilton region in south-western Victoria was used for this analysis as it represents the whole flock and it includes a powerful feed-budgeting module that optimises animal and pasture management across the whole farm. The survival and production of the single- and twin-born progeny was adjusted {{on the basis of the}} liveweight profile of the single- and twin-bearing ewes. Our hypothesis was supported and profitability was increased by approximately AU$ 4630 /farm or AU$ 0. 80 /ewe, by scanning ewes for pregnancy status and litter size, and the optimum liveweight profiles were different for dry, single- and twin-bearing ewes. The majority of the increase in profit was due to identifying litter size and being able to differentially manage the single- and twin-bearing ewes. When ewes are scanned for pregnancy status and litter size, the most profitable combination of profiles involves all ewes losing 4 kg in early pregnancy and single-bearing ewes regaining the 4 kg to lamb at their standard <b>reference</b> <b>weight,</b> twin-bearing ewes gaining 8 kg to lamb above their standard <b>reference</b> <b>weight</b> and dry ewes losing a further 4 kg to be 8 kg lighter than their standard <b>reference</b> <b>weight</b> at lambing time...|$|E

40|$|State tying {{effectively}} {{strikes a}} balance between detailed modeling and robust parameter estimation for hidden Markov models (HMMs) in automatic speech recognition. However, triphone HMMs that {{are tied to the}} same state are not distinguishable in that state. Recently we proposed the idea of distinct acoustic modeling in which no states are tied. In our novel clustered-based eigentriphone modeling method, triphones (or states) are grouped into non-overlapping clusters, from each of which, an orthogonal eigenbasis is derived using weighted PCA. Then all member triphones (or states) of a cluster are projected as distinct points onto the space spanned by its eigenvectors. In this paper, we propose a new simpler training method called <b>reference</b> model <b>weighting</b> (RMW) which removes the requirement of an orthogonal basis in eigentriphone, and directly uses a set of reference model vectors in a cluster as the basis. All member model vectors are then constrained to lie in the space spanned by these reference model vectors. The difference between eigentriphone modeling and <b>reference</b> model <b>weighting</b> is analogous to the difference between eigenvoice and <b>reference</b> speaker <b>weighting</b> in speaker adaptation. The new RMW method shows consistently better performance than eigentriphone and the baseline tied-state HMMs in WSJ 0 word recognition and TIMIT phoneme recognition...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} the image of 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans in {{overweight}} patients is commonly degraded. This study evaluates, retrospectively, the relation between SNR, weight and dose injected in 65 patients, with a range of weights from 35 to 120 kg, with scans performed using the Biograph mCT using a standardized protocol in the Nuclear Medicine Department at Radboud University Medical Centre in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Five ROI’s were made in the liver, assumed to be an organ of homogenous metabolism, at the same location, in five consecutive slices of the PET/CT scans to obtain the mean uptake (signal) values and its standard deviation (noise). The ratio of both gave us the Signal-to- Noise Ratio in the liver. With the help of a spreadsheet, weight, height, SNR and Body Mass Index were calculated and graphs were designed in order to obtain the relation between these factors. The graphs showed that SNR decreases as the body weight and/or BMI increased and also showed that, even though the dose injected increased, the SNR also decreased. This {{is due to the fact}} that heavier patients receive higher dose and, as reported, heavier patients have less SNR. These findings suggest that the {{quality of the}} images, measured by SNR, that were acquired in heavier patients are worst than thinner patients, even though higher FDG doses are given. With all this taken in consideration, it was necessary to make a new formula to calculate a new dose to give to patients and having a good and constant SNR in every patient. Through mathematic calculations, it was possible to reach to two new equations (power and exponential), which would lead to a SNR from a scan made with a specific <b>reference</b> <b>weight</b> (86 kg was the considered one) which was independent of body mass. The study implies that with these new formulas, patients heavier than the <b>reference</b> <b>weight</b> will receive higher doses and lighter patients will receive less doses.

40|$|Accurate force/torque (F/T) {{information}} is essentially {{important for a}} robot manipulator to regulate the contact forces and torques exerted on its tool (end-effector). For a manipulator with mounted F/T sensor, the tool and the F/T sensor {{are connected to the}} manipulator via some components, of which many parameters such as mounting errors and component's weight are unknown. As a result, the forces and torques exerted upon the work point of the tool of a manipulator is not what directly sensed by the F/T sensor, and thus the F/T sense of the manipulator need to be recalibrated even though the mounted F/T sensor had been calibrated in advance. Also the unknown parameters introduce challenges to the on-line recalibration of the F/T sense of the manipulator.
