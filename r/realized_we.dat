500|$|After {{spending}} {{several years}} operating at a loss, GoodHome.com reorganized {{under the name}} Scene7, which formally launched in January 2001, with $15 million raised from investors that included Hearst Interactive Media. The new company focused on helping companies prepare interactive advertisements for consumers. Mack, the Broderbund executive who had decided to spin off the company, reflected on the decision to reorganize and relaunch: [...] "We got a year into [...] and the whole B2C (business-to-consumer) market tanked, and we <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> could not build a successful business as a portal [...] But the whole time we kept having people approach us to license the technology , and finally a light bulb went off when we <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> were {{sitting on top of}} a great technology we could sell." [...] Scene7 raised a round of financing on July 12, 2001 that totaled $11.3million, which helped stabilize the company. The deal was led by venture capitalists from several firms, including Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management and Xcelera of the Cayman Islands, with cash investments from Cooley Godward and Perkins Coie. After the latest round of financing, Mack planned for Scene7 to have 15clients and a burn rate, or negative cash flow, of less than $700,000 a month, stating, [...] "What we learned was to stick to your strategy, and don't get nervous when the competition is adopting a strategy to spend their way to victory." [...] At the time, the company's revenues were well below its peak of $1million a month, but Mack intended to increase revenues past that point in a few months.|$|E
500|$|The Who {{had planned}} to perform Tommy live since {{starting}} the project. The group spent April 1969 rehearsing a live version of the show at the Hanwell Community Centre in Ealing including a final run down of the entire stage piece on 23 April. The running order was changed, and four songs ("Cousin Kevin", [...] "Underture", [...] "Sensation" [...] and [...] "Welcome") were dropped entirely. Townshend later said the group [...] "did the whole thing {{from start to finish}} and that was when we first <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> had something cohesive and playable." [...] Daltrey's voice had improved substantially since the group's early tours, and they realised their new live act could completely change their career.|$|E

500|$|According to Monaghan, Drive Shaft {{is similar}} to Oasis, in that [...] " [...] first album {{was kind of like}} Oasis's first album: {{critically}} acclaimed, didn't sell big numbers, but in the industry, people gave it respect." [...] J.J Abrams and Damon Linelof told Monaghan that if he wanted to write the song that would be Charlie's [...] "one hit wonder", they would consider using it in the show. Monaghan wrote a song called [...] "Photos and Plans" [...] with a friend; Abrams and Lindelof liked the song, but it did not make it into Lost. The lyrics were inspired by an incident on The Phil Donahue Show, where Matt Reeves, who was close friends with producers Bryan Burk and Damon Lindelof, saw a female audience member yell out, [...] "You all everybody, acting like it's the stupid people wearing expensive clothes." [...] The producers had an inside joke where they would say this quotation to each other. According to Burk, [...] "At one point, in a delirious stupor, we <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> had said it so many times that that had to be the song." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} create the effect of Mulder and Scully [...] "melting", special effects {{producer}} Bill Millar captured video of Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny in three-dimensional high-definition videoâ€”the two actors were scanned with a special laser at Glendale, California {{and the results were}} manipulated by a computer. Millar noted that, [...] "when we looked at our first test, we <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> couldn't melt Mulder and Scully without some degree of difficulty [...] They had to melt like movie stars [...] without turning Gillian into Margaret Thatcher and David into John Hurt as The Elephant Man". In order to compensate for the difficulties, Millar used a [...] "leading edge" [...] melting effect that melted parts of the actors' faces, keeping their facial features intact until the [...] "goop" [...] overtook them. For other shots, Anderson and Duchovny had to endure hours of being covered by a vegetable-derived food thickener with yellow food coloring that stood in for the fungal secretion. In addition, Anderson and Duchovny were literally buried under the earth for the final scene: large pits were dug and scaffolding was constructed inside of them. The two actors then wore wet suits and were covered in the vegetable fluid and soil.|$|E
500|$|Due to time constraints, a team {{of writers}} was {{assigned}} to write the teleplay. In addition to the story credit to Ganino and Stillwell, Moore, Ira Steven Behr, Hans Beimler and Richard Manning would work on the teleplay, and Piller would provide the finishing touches. Because the Writers Guild would not allow more than three staff writers {{to appear in the}} credits (four after a special waiver was granted), Piller agreed to not feature his name in the credits. A partial first draft was submitted on November 30 so that preproduction for the episode could commence. The altered timeline provided a chance to show the Enterprise crew in a much more dramatic and human light than would be allowable in a normal episode. Behr explained that since the original timeline was to be restored, the writers had the freedom to include more action. [...] "Even though it was an alternate universe, [...] and I got all excited because we <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> were going to kill everyone on screen", he said. Michael Okuda and Rick Sternbach submitted technical memos regarding the type of anomaly that might drag the Enterprise-C through time, and suggested interstellar, super-dense strings as a possibility. The first draft teleplay was completed by December 4, and a preproduction meeting was held the same day. Given the scale of the story, various departments argued over costs and what items could be cut to reduce the budget. The final draft was finished and submitted on December 8.|$|E

500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E

2500|$|With {{the game}} sharing the [...] as the 1998 {{installment}} in the franchise, the gameâ€™s creative director, Craig Sullivan, told why they didnâ€™t name the game something totally different, stating: [...] "To be honest {{when we started}} out making the game we didnâ€™t know {{it was going to}} be called Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, we just didnâ€™t. We got to the game before we got to the name. We <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> were making something that had a lot of cops in it and was really interesting to us, so we thought what can we call this? Eventually we thought this actually fits quite well with Hot Pursuit and went with it." ...|$|E

One Barcelona executive stated, [...] "When I saw those scenes of Maradona fighting and the chaos that followed I <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> couldn't go any further with him." [...] Maradona got into frequent disputes with FC Barcelona executives, particularly club president Josep LluÃ­s NÃºÃ±ez, culminating with a demand to be transferred out of Camp Nou in 1984. During his two injury-hit seasons at Barcelona, Maradona scored 38 goals in 58 games. Maradona transferred to Napoli in Italy's Serie A for another world record fee, Â£6.9 million ($10.48M).|$|E
2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{most of the}} {{sampling}} for Paul's Boutique was cleared, but at dramatically lower costs compared to today's prevailing rates.

But the preparation of thin sections was too cumbersome for routine use, and Flewett and his co-workers showed that these viruses could be seen by electron microscopy directly in faeces. Flewett and his colleagues in his Birmingham laboratory had observed these viruses in the faeces of sick children before the publication of Ruth Bishop's paper but they failed to realise {{that they were the}} cause of the infection. The virus particles have a wheel-shaped appearance by electron microscopy, and it was Flewett who gave them the name [...] "rotavirus," [...] by which they have been known since.

2500|$|Movie Maker Magazine {{asked the}} producers, [...] "Voices of Iraq {{is truly a}} {{groundbreaking}} filmâ€”both {{in terms of its}} content and the process behind its production.

[...] For years we had heard only the American mediaâ€™s version of what Iraq and its people were like. We decided that since Iraq was such a major issue in the U.S., it was time to hear their story first-hand. Iraqis are a wonderfully diverse group {{of people who have been}} silenced for over 24 years, living in fear of Saddam Hussein and his regime. We <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> could finally give Iraqis a venue to freely share their lives, hopes and dreams with the rest of the world now that he was no longer in complete control of the country." [...] When questioned on the film's budget, Martin Kunert said, [...] "We used single chip, GR-D30U JVC cameras, which you can buy used on the net for around $230." [...] "Our budget came out to around $500,000. With inexpensive cameras and editing stations, the greatest expense was our post-production staff: translators and assistant editors.

2500|$|A {{great deal}} of time was also spent working out the control scheme. The game {{originally}} had a target-lock system, based on the controls in Syphon Filter and Devil May Cry. However, the developers were unhappy with this system as they felt the gameplay was based more on [...] "PC-style shooters" [...] such as Half Life, which uses a mouse and keyboard control scheme to facilitate easier free aiming, rather than a target lock system. As such, [...] "with our controls for a console-style shooter but our gameplay from a PC-style shooter, about a year into development we <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> had a dangerous disconnect in our design that made our game tedious instead of fun."
