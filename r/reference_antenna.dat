Specifically, a measurement based channel model is applied which allows the embedding of application antennas such as the proposed CTIA <b>reference</b> <b>antennas.</b> Three different channel models (a 3 -D full, a 2 -D full and a 2 -D single polarimetric model) are considered. Numerical results on system capacity and throughput simulations are illustrated by several examples. It is found that the relative error in terms of capacity between the 3 -D full and the 2 -D full polarimetric model is less than 10 % for uplink transmissions when the signal-to-noise ratio target is reached with the available transmit power. Further, the results show that when completely neglecting the polarization characteristics of the propagation environment, the throughput and capacity errors can rise up to 50 %. In addition, simulation results indicate that the LTE system with CTIA 'Nominal' <b>reference</b> <b>antennas</b> outperforms the LTE system with 'Good' <b>reference</b> <b>antennas</b> for the uplink transmission in some channel fading environments...|$|R

40|$|A {{reverberation}} chamber is {{a convenient}} tool for over-the-air testing of MIMO devices in isotropic environments. Isotropy is typically {{achieved in the}} chamber {{through the use of}} a mode stirrer and a turntable on which the device under test (DUT) rides. The quality of the isotropic environment depends on the number of plane waves produced by the chamber and on their spatial distribution. This paper investigates how the required sampling rate for the DUT pattern is related to the plane-wave density threshold in the isotropic environment required to accurately compute antenna correlations. Once the plane-wave density is above the threshold, the antenna correlation obtained through isotropic experiments agrees with the antenna correlation obtained from the classical definition, as has been proven theoretically. This fact is verified for the good, nominal, and bad <b>reference</b> <b>antennas</b> produced by CTIA. MIMO channel capacity simulations are performed with a standard base station model and the DUT placed in a single-tap plane-wave reverberation chamber model.

40|$|Abstract—Four ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas are proposed: one <b>referenced</b> <b>antenna</b> without notch {{and three}} novel antennas with one, {{two and three}} notched bands, respectively. The UWB <b>referenced</b> <b>antenna</b> {{consists}} of a beveled rectangular metal patch, a 50 Ω microstrip line and a defective ground plane.

The frequency domain characteristics including VSWR, transfer coefficient S 21, radiation patterns and group delay are investigated. It is found that the EBG design approach is {{a good candidate for}} frequency rejection at the certain frequencies, owing to high performance of notch design and the notched-band bandwidth control abilities. Meanwhile, these abilities also enable less useful frequencies rejected. The design examples exhibit good bandrejected characteristics in the WiMAX/WLAN interference bands (3. 4, 5. 2 and 5. 8 -GHz bands).

Some advanced forms of transmission multiplexing combine frequency and time division approaches like OFDM or CDMA.In cellular telephone communications, the air interface is the radio-frequency portion of the circuit between the cellular phone set or wireless modem (usually portable or mobile) and the active base station.

Each changeover {{is known as a}} handoff.Inverted F anttenna use as mobile phone interface medium.In radio and electronics, an antenna (plural antennae or antennas), or aerial, is an electrical device which converts electric power into radio waves, and vice versa.1 It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. a high frequency alternating current (AC)) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves).An antenna focuses the radio waves in a certain direction. Usually, this is called the main direction. Because of that, in other directions less energy wil be emitted. The gain of an antenna, in a given direction, is usually referenced to an (hypothetical) isotropic antenna, which emits the radiation evenly strong in all directions. The antenna gain is the power in the strongest direction divided by the power that would be transmitted by an isotropic antenna emitting the same total power. In this case the antenna gain (Gi) is often specified in dBi, or decibels over isotropic. Other reference antennas are also used, especially: •gain relative to a half-wave dipole (Gd), when the <b>reference</b> <b>antenna</b> is a half-wave dipole antenna;•gain relative to a short vertical antenna (Gv), when the <b>reference</b> <b>antenna</b> is a linear conductor, much shorter than one quarter of the wavelength.|$|E

30|$|In both scenarios, the {{backscattering}} {{signals from}} an UWB antenna were {{measured in the}} frequency domain {{by means of a}} vector network analyzer in the 2 - 12 GHz band with steps of 5 MHz. Two Horn Lindgren 3117 antennas were employed as <b>reference</b> <b>antennas.</b> They were placed in a quasi-monostatic configuration, separated by 18 cm, guaranteeing a high isolation between the transmit and receive channels as shown in Figure 2. Two kinds of UWB scattering antennas were tested, namely, a balanced antipodal Vivaldi (BAV) and a monopole dual feed stripline (DFMS) antennas [36]. In particular, the DFMS is a small planar antenna of dimensions 40 × 24 × 3 mm 3 characterized by moderately directional and non-dispersive properties, which make it quite suitable for RFID tags [37]. Three different load conditions (open-circuit, short-circuit, and matched) and several antenna orientations were considered. Inside the anechoic chamber, the antenna under test was placed on a 3 D positioner at distance dref = 1.46 m (DFMS) and dref = 1.44 m (BAV) from the <b>reference</b> <b>antennas</b> dressed with absorbers to create a quasifree-space condition. The laboratory environment consisted of a room of dimension 5.13 × 4.49 m 2, where a rectangular grid of nine points as shown in Figure 2, spaced out of about 1 m in depth and 70 cm in width, was defined. The tag DFMS antenna was positioned alternatively in each point on a vertical support still dressed with absorbers. For both cases, a simple data post-processing was performed to obtain the antenna backscattering response from the measured parameter S 21 = H(f; dref, X, Θ). The collected data were first windowed in the frequency domain to avoid ringing effect. Then, applying the inverse Fourier transform, the signal in the time domain was derived.
