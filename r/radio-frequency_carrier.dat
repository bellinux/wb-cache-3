50|$|Given all {{of these}} parameters, {{the result is a}} mostly-continuous analog signal which can be {{modulated}} onto a <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>carrier</b> and transmitted through an antenna. All analog television systems use vestigial sideband modulation, a form of amplitude modulation in which one sideband is partially removed. This reduces the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, enabling narrower channels to be used.|$|E
50|$|When a {{transmitter}} broadcasts an NTSC signal, it amplitude-modulates a <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>carrier</b> {{with the}} NTSC signal just described, while it frequency-modulates a carrier 4.5 MHz higher with the audio signal. If non-linear distortion {{happens to the}} broadcast signal, the 3.579545 MHz color carrier may beat with the sound carrier to produce a dot pattern on the screen. To make the resulting pattern less noticeable, designers adjusted the original 15,750 Hz scanline rate down {{by a factor of}} 1.001 (0.1%) to match the audio carrier frequency divided by the factor 286, resulting in a field rate of approximately 59.94 Hz. This adjustment ensures that the sums and differences of the sound carrier and the color subcarrier and their multiples (i.e., the intermodulation products of the two carriers) are not exact multiples of the frame rate, which is the necessary condition for the dots to remain stationary on the screen, making them most noticeable.|$|E
40|$|Remote-control {{installations}} {{are generally}} operated by an audio-frequency tone on a <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>carrier.</b> A different modulating frequency {{is necessary for}} each channel or remote operation. A system is now being developed which uses a seven-bit binary code number for each channel. In order to utilize the conventional radiotelegraph transmitter presently installed in ships at sea the binary numbers 0 and 1 were converted to dots and dashes. The circuit described in this report distinguishes the received dots from dashes and produces pulses at two separate outputs. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

Devised to compensate somewhat for effect, upon distant receiver, of unbalance in stream of transmitted data. Formulated to compute combinations of modulation index, data rate, and transmitter power compensating for measured unbalance in transmitted data stream...|$|R
50|$|For older analog {{cathode ray}} tube (CRT) technology, display lag is {{extremely}} low, {{due to the nature}} of the technology, which does not have the ability to store image data before display. The picture signal is minimally processed internally, simply for demodulation from a <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>carrier</b> wave (for televisions), and then splitting into separate signals for the red, green, and blue electron guns, and for timing of the vertical and horizontal sync. Image adjustments typically involved reshaping the signal waveform but without storage, so the image is written to the screen as fast as it is received, with only nanoseconds of delay for the signal to traverse the wiring inside the device from input to the screen.|$|R
40|$|Future {{satellite}} communications can benefit greatly from {{the usage of}} frequencies in the optical spectrum. These allow data-rates comparable to fiber optical communications and provide additional advantages over traditional <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>carriers</b> like more power efficiency, small weight and size, and usage of frequency bands without ITU regulation. However, optical satellite downlinks {{are affected by the}} degradation of signal quality due to atmospheric turbulence. In fact, a profoundly verified channel model for this scenario does not exist yet, as there is no satisfying database of channel measurements so far. To contribute in disposing this lack of data, the Optical Communications Group at DLR performed laser downlinks from the Japanese OICETS to the DLR Optical Ground Station in Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich, Germany, in 2006 and 2009. The trials in 2006 were in cooperation with JAXA, NICT and DLR, whereas in 2009 {{they were part of a}} downlink-campaign comprising JAXA, NICT, ESA, NASA/JPL, and DLR. Measurements of intensity scintillations and wave-front distortions were undertaken that show the development of atmospheric turbulence over the elevation angle. Measurement devices like the differential image motion monitor, pupil camera, Shack-Hartmann wave-front sensor, and power meters were applied. Metrics that may be derived from the measurements are Fried parameter, scintillation index, intensity correlation length, and complex wave-front. The measurements may support the refinement of the common channel models. The applied communication scheme was a 50 -Mbit/s on-off keying at a wavelength of 847 nm. Bit-error rates were recorded in parallel to the atmospheric measurements. In ten trials out of eighteen, signals were received while the others were hindered by cloud blockage. Seven of these trials were found to have useful data for analysis. The elevation angle of the analyzed links ranges between 4 and 55 deg. The present paper contains a description of the experiments in 2006 and 2009 and highlights the results so far. In this paper, the setup of the optical ground station is outlined as well as the measurement devices and results. Emphasis is put on analysis of the measurements of received optical power and complex wave-fronts...|$|R

Encoder/multiplexer combination effects PMD scheme, in which biotelemetry encoded in time-division multiplex PIM, while voice encoded in PWM. Combination of PIM and PWM encoding called "pulse modulated data" or PMD.

40|$|Oscillators, {{which produce}} {{continuous}} periodic signals from direct current power, {{are central to}} modern communications systems, with versatile applications such as timing references and frequency modulators. However, conventional oscillators typically consist of macroscopic mechanical resonators such as quartz crystals, which require excessive off-chip space. Here we report oscillators built on micron-size, atomically-thin graphene nanomechanical resonators, whose frequencies can be electrostatically tuned {{by as much as}} 14 %. The self-sustaining mechanical motion of the oscillators is generated and transduced at room temperature by simple electrical circuitry. The prototype graphene voltage controlled oscillators exhibit frequency stability and modulation bandwidth sufficient for modulation of <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>carrier</b> signals. As a demonstration, we employ a graphene oscillator as the active element for frequency modulated signal generation, and achieve efficient audio signal transmission.

40|$|BCIs {{are often}} {{directed}} at expanding, assisting or restoring human sensory-motor or cognitive functions {{by offering a}} direct communication route between the human brain and any external devices. In Invasive BCI the sensors are implanted inside the brain {{on the surface of}} cerebrum. So far invasive BCI using wireless sensors has not been achieved. Most research to date regarding invasive BCI using wireless sensors has revolved around communications along the surface of the body by the use of traditional electromagnetic (EM) <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>carrier</b> waves. The major impediment that we face today in order to enable this dream of networked-implantable-devices is caused by the physical nature of propagation in humans. Our body is composed primarily of water, which is a medium through which Radio frequency EM waves do not easily propagate. Therefore, in this article we take a distinctive perspective and inspect the possibility of using ultrasonic waves to wirelessly interconnect sensors in the brain. We propose a new energy model required for ultrasonic propagation. Since the sensors need to be implanted inside the brain, therefore to avoid frequent implants we design a new clustering algorithm which overcomes the drawbacks of existing LEACH algorithm and uses lesser energy, hence enhancing the lifetime of sensors...|$|E
40|$|Wirelessly {{networked}} {{systems of}} intra-body sensors and actuators could enable revolutionary applications {{at the intersection}} between biomedical science, networking, and control with a strong potential to advance medical treatment of major diseases of our times. Yet, most research to date has focused on communications along the body surface among devices interconnected through traditional electromagnetic <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>carrier</b> waves; while the underlying root challenge of enabling networked intra-body miniaturized sensors and actuators that communicate through body tissues is substantially unaddressed. The main obstacle to enabling this vision of networked implantable devices is posed by the physical nature of propagation in the human body. The human body is composed primarily (65 percent) of water, a medium through which RF electromagnetic waves do not easily propagate, even at relatively low frequencies. Therefore, {{in this article we}} take a different perspective and propose to investigate and study the use of ultrasonic waves to wirelessly internetwork intra-body devices. We discuss the fundamentals of ultrasonic propagation in tissues, and explore important tradeoffs, including the choice of a transmission frequency, transmission power, and transducer size. Then, we discuss future research challenges for ultrasonic networking of intra-body devices at the physical, medium access and network layers of the protocol stack...|$|R
