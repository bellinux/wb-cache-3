Numerous species, including more than 50 species of waterfowl pass by the lake during migration in March. These include ducks, geese, swans, and other species. Shorebirds are also common on the lake.

30|$|The 2006 to 2008 taxa {{lists and}} their {{abundance}} [22] {{were entered into}} the SPEAR web calculator ([URL] accessed 7 June 2010), whereas the 2014 macroinvertebrate data were analysed using the SPEAR calculator v 0.9. 0 ([URL] accessed 6 November 2015, using family-level taxa, default traits and no <b>recovery</b> <b>areas).</b> Four taxa [Ostracoda (1 entry), Collembola (3 entries), Gordius aquaticus (4 entries), Podura (1 entry)] were deleted {{because they could not}} be found in the SPEAR database. In the web calculator Central Europe was selected as region, SPEARpesticides was calculated and absence or presence of <b>recovery</b> <b>areas</b> was not assessed (no values assigned). The explanatory power of the SPEAR indicator does not suffer significantly if family-level data are used instead of species-level data [12], the taxonomic resolution of the macroinvertebrate data used here is sufficient.|$|R

50|$|By late 2012, it was {{estimated}} that there were at least 75 wolves and four breeding pairs living in the <b>recovery</b> <b>areas,</b> with 27% of the population consisting of pups.

The State Highway and Transportation Commission banned these transportation modes from using the bridge in 1978 [...] "in the interest of safety", due to high traffic and lack of sidewalks. Once the replacement bridge was completed, {{they returned to the}} question in 1983, and decided to continue the ban, since the new bridge also had no sidewalks or sufficient <b>recovery</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The $450 million [...] {{patient care}} {{facility}} was constructed as a ten-floor structure. There {{is currently a}} four-floor base with an emergency department, radiology services, eight new operating rooms, same day surgery facilities, a post-anesthesia care unit, and a <b>recovery</b> <b>area,</b> along with a new lobby, coffee shop, gift shop, and waiting areas. Constructed above this are two separate six-floor patient bed towers.

2500|$|On 24 December 2011 Louhi and Linja, another Finnish spill {{response}} vessel, were {{dispatched to}} the Gulf of Bothnia as a precaution after a tall oil spill from Arizona Chemical plant near Söderhamn in Sweden. While Sweden had not send an official request for assistance yet, the Finnish recovery ships prepared to join the spill combating operation if the oil slick, at that time some [...] northeast from Söderhamn, started drifting towards the Finnish coast. Although Louhi can operate in relatively high seas, the recovery effort was hindered and subsequently the oil slick was broken up by the storm on 27 December 2011. When Louhi moved to the <b>recovery</b> <b>area</b> on 28 December, the slick could not be located and only [...] of weathered oil was recovered.|$|E
25|$|Within the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{concentrates}} {{its effort}} to restore grizzly bears in six <b>recovery</b> <b>areas.</b> These are Northern Continental Divide (Montana), Yellowstone (Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho), Cabinet-Yaak (Montana and Idaho), Selway-Bitterroot (Montana and Idaho), Selkirk (Idaho and Washington), and North Cascades (Washington). The grizzly population in these areas is estimated at 750 in the Northern Continental Divide, 550 in Yellowstone, 40 in the Yaak portion of the Cabinet-Yaak, and 15 in the Cabinet portion (in northwestern Montana), 105 in Selkirk region of Idaho, 10–20 in the North Cascades, and none currently in Selway-Bitterroots, {{although there have been}} sightings. These are estimates because bears move in and out of these areas, and it is therefore impossible to conduct a precise count.

30|$|Many {{deployment}} {{scenarios of}} multihop wireless networks require high transmission reliability; for instance, wireless ad hoc and sensor networks are anticipated {{to be deployed}} in disaster <b>recovery</b> <b>areas,</b> battlefields, remote patients' homes, and so forth. While it is sometimes argued that high density of devices can potentially cater for reliability [1], due to energy depletion and lack of battery recharging facilities, even a dense network eventually becomes sparse. Therefore, protocol stack of a data-critical network should have in-built support for transmission reliability.|$|R
40|$|The {{northern}} {{hardwood forest}} type {{is an important}} habitat component for the endangered Carolina northern flying squirrel (CNFS; Glaucomys sabrinus coloratus) for den sites and corridor habitats between boreo-montane conifer patches foraging areas. Our study related terrain data to presence of northern hardwood forest type in the <b>recovery</b> <b>areas</b> of CNFS in the southern Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and southwestern Virginia. We recorded overstory species composition and terrain variables at 338 points, to construct a robust, spatially predictive model. Terrain variables analyzed included elevation, aspect, slope gradient, site curvature, and topographic exposure. We used an information-theoretic approach to assess seven models based on associations noted in existing literature {{as well as an}} inclusive global model. Our results indicate that, on a regional scale, elevation, aspect, and topographic exposure index (TEI) are significant predictors of the presence of the northern hardwood forest type in the southern Appalachians. Our elevation + TEI model was the best approximating model (the lowest AICc score) for predicting northern hardwood forest type correctly classifying approximately 78 % of our sample points. We then used these data to create region-wide predictive maps of the distribution of the northern hardwood forest type within CNFS <b>recovery</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

50|$|The $32 million Center for Advanced Care, {{also known}} as the Parkview Addition, was {{completed}} in November 2000.
