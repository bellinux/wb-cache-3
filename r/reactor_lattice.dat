40|$|An {{optimization}} procedure {{based on}} the Genetic Algorithms method was developed for the optimization of enrichment and gadolinia distributions in boiling water <b>reactor</b> fuel <b>lattices.</b> The optimization process {{was linked to the}} HELIOS code to evaluate and qualify all the investigated solutions.

The weighting factors, used to give the relative importance of the evaluation parameters in the objective function, take two different values depending on the values of the evaluation parameters. This strategy helped the process to rapidly guide the search toward configurations which satisfy all the constraints. The genetic algorithm uses one crossover point, and two offspring. The main contribution of this work is the development of an efficient procedure for BWR fuel lattice design, using a powerful algorithm and an objective function which saves computing time, because it does not require lattice burnup calculations.

40|$|The {{development}} of advanced computers with special capabilities for vectorized or parallel calculations demands the {{development of}} new calculational methods. The very nature of the Monte Carlo process precludes direct conversion of old (scalar) codes to the new machines. Instead, major changes in global algorithms and careful selection of compatible physics treatments are required. Recent results for Monte Carlo in multigroup shielding applications and in continuous-energy <b>reactor</b> <b>lattice</b> analysis have demonstrated that Monte Carlo methods can be successfully vectorized. The significant effort required for stylized coding and major algorithmic changes is worthwhile, and significant gains in computational efficiency are realized.

40|$|The nuclear {{parameters}} of a <b>reactor</b> <b>lattice</b> may {{be determined by}} critical experiments on that lattice, by theoretical calculations in which only cross sections are used as input, or by methods which combine theory and experiment. Of those methods which combine theory and experiment, the Single Element Method, abbreviated SEM, is shown to have great usefulness. As used here, the method combines experiments on the smallest meaningful unit of fuel - a single fuel element - with a theory which relates {{the behavior of a}} lattice of such elements to the experimentally determined behavior of the single element. This particular division of the problem into theory and experiment is useful for at least three reasons. First, several parameters which characterize a <b>reactor</b> <b>lattice</b> - the thermal utilization and resonance escape probability, for example - often depend strongly and in a complicated manner on the properties of individual fuel elements, but only depend weakly or in a simple manner on interactions between the fuel elements. In the Single Element Method, the largest contribution to these parameters is determined by measurements on a single fuel element, and only a relatively small correction to account for the presence {{of the rest of the}} fuel elements need be estimated theoretically. Second, the determination of lattice parameters in this way represents a desirable saving of time, money, effort, and material over their determination in critical or exponential experiments. Third, it is shown that the method provides an excellent way of correlating the results of experimental measurements, since it shows what pertinent variables must be used to express the quantity of interest in a linear or nearly linear fashion. Values obtained by the SEM for the thermal utilization of lattices of uranium rods in heavy water are accurate to about 0. 3 percent (by comparison with THERMOS). Values of P 28, 28, and C* are obtained by the SEM for the same lattices to an accuracy of between five and ten percent (by comparison with experiment). The same method yields values of 28 with are equally accurate in lattices moderated by light water. In addition, the theoretical development of the SEM predicts that P 28, 28, C*, and 625 should vary nearly linearly with the inverse of the unit cell volume (for a fixed size of fuel element). This explains the experimentally observed behavior and provides an important tool for the rational correlation of experimental results. Statement of responsibility on title page reads: Edward E.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed to treat resonance self-shielding in doubly heterogeneous very high temperature gas-cooled reactor systems in which the fuel compact region of a <b>reactor</b> <b>lattice</b> consists of small fuel grains dispersed in a graphite matrix. The new method first homogenizes the fuel grain and matrix materials using an analytically derived disadvantage factor from a two-region problem with equivalence theory and intermediate resonance method. The disadvantage factor accounts for spatial self-shielding effects inside each grain {{within the framework of}} an infinite array of grains. Then the homogenized fuel compact is self-shielded using a Bondarenko method to account for interactions between the fuel compact regions in the fuel lattice. In the final form of the equations for actual implementations, the double-heterogeneity effects are accounted for by simply using a modified definition of a background cross section, which includes geometry parameters and cross sections for both the grain and fuel compact regions. With the new method, the doubly heterogeneous resonance self-shielding effect can be treated easily even with legacy codes programmed only for a singly heterogeneous system by simple modifications in the background cross section for resonance integral interpolations. This paper presents a detailed derivation of the new method and a sensitivity study of double-heterogeneity parameters introduced during the derivation.

40|$|Two of {{the primary}} {{challenges}} associated with the neutronic analysis of the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) are accounting for resonance self-shielding in the particle fuel (contributing to the double heterogeneity) and accounting for temperature feedback due to Doppler broadening. The double heterogeneity challenge is addressed by defining a "double heterogeneity factor" (DHF) that allows conventional light water <b>reactor</b> (LWR) <b>lattice</b> physics codes to analyze VHTR configurations. The challenge of treating Doppler broadening is addressed by a new "on-the-fly" methodology that is applied during the random walk process with negligible impact on computational efficiency. Although this methodology was motivated {{by the need to}} treat temperature feedback in a VHTR, it is applicable to any reactor design. The on-the-fly Doppler methodology is based on a combination of Taylor and asymptotic series expansions. The type of series representation was determined by investigating the temperature dependence of U 238 resonance cross sections in three regions: near the resonance peaks, mid-resonance, and the resonance wings. The coefficients for these series expansions were determined by regressions over the energy and temperature range of interest. The comparison of the broadened cross sections using this methodology with the NJOY cross sections was excellent. A Monte Carlo code was implemented to apply the combined regression model and used to estimate the additional computing cost which was found to be less than 1 %. The DHF accounts for the effect of the particle heterogeneity on resonance absorption in particle fuel. The first level heterogeneity posed by the VHTR fuel particles is a unique characteristic that cannot be accounted for by conventional LWR lattice physics codes. On the other hand, Monte Carlo codes can take into account the detailed geometry of the VHTR including resolution of individual fuel particles without resonance approximation. The DHF, basically a self shielding factor, was found to be weakly dependent on space and fuel depletion. The DHF only depends strongly on the packing fraction in a fuel compact. Therefore, it is proposed that DHFs be tabulated as a function of packing fraction to analyze the heterogeneous fuel in VHTR configuration with LWR lattice physics codes...|$|R
40|$|Simulations of {{discharges}} in plasma <b>reactors</b> {{using the}} <b>lattice</b> Boltzmann method (LBM) are presented, and their significance {{for determining the}} uniformity of the sheath and surface processes are discussed. In previous studies [1] we successfully applied the LBM {{to the evolution of}} the neutral component of weakly ionised processing plasmas, and examined the influence of the neutrals on the charged species (modelled crudely assuming ambipolar diffusion with a collisional drag term), finding a significant effect on the sheath properties, and hence on the processing characteristics, in certain ranges of the discharge parameters. Here we extend these simulations, employing a much more realistic model for the charged species: we solve for the ion and electron densities and the potential self-consistently using an efficient, implicit scheme. The difference between this work and previous results using a similar approach is that we include the collisional coupling to the moving neutral gas (whose flow is determined using the LBM). This more accurate treatment of the plasma component allows a detailed, quantitative analysis of the plasma evolution to be made. In processing plasmas the nature of the sheath above the substrate is of crucial importance in determining the number flux and energies of ions delivered to the substrate. With this in mind we use our simulations to examine the impact of the neutral flow and other factors on the sheath characteristics and uniformity. Potential limitations of these simulations are discussed and further generalisations of this work are outlined. [1] Barrett, R. K., Wade, N. S. and Diver, D. A.

It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS. Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) title. A simplified polyenergetic cell theory is formulated to determine spatially averaged energy dependent thermal fluxes in the moderator, cladding, and fuel regions within the unit cell of a <b>reactor</b> <b>lattice.</b> The derived spectra are then utilized in the calculations of the thermal integral parameters and average cross sections required for reactor computations. The cell theory, as formulated, postulates an infinite moderator region with the absorption cross section of this region appropriately modified to account for the neutron leakage into and absorption by the fuel element. The modifications to the moderator absorption cross section are formulated both in terms of the net current at the fuel element-moderator interface and in terms of energy dependent moderator and fuel element escape probabilities, the latter approach offering physical transparency and ease of calculation. Analytic expressions for the escape probabilities are presented, integral transport theory being applied to the fuel element region, while diffusion theory is utilized in the moderator region. Using these analytic expressions, the theory is applied to actual lattices {{in the form of the}} light water moderated and uranium dioxide fueled cores of the Cornell University Zero Power Reactor. Room temperature parameters and their temperature coefficients are determined using both the monatomic gas model and the Nelkin water kernel to describe the energy transfer process in the moderator. Calculations are made with PROGRAM COUTH, a Fortran- 63 program written for use with the Control Data Corporation 1604 digital computer. A typical lattice calculation including the computation of the spatially averaged fuel, cladding, and moderator spectra and the thermal integral properties and average cross sections takes approximately thirty-five seconds of computer time. This figure is exclusive of the compiling time and the time required to calculate the moderator scattering kernel. In an attempt to estimate the accuracy of the calculational results, the method is applied to the Brookhaven National Laboratory uranium dioxide cores and the results are then compared with those predicted by Honeck's THERMOS code. Disadvantage factors agree to within 1. 0 % while the thermal utilizations agree to within 0. 5 %.

40|$|The Boundary Element Method (BEM) {{has been}} {{competing}} {{for years with}} the Finite Element Method (FEM) as a solver of partial differential equations of elliptic type. As well known, the origins of BEM {{can be traced back}} to I. Fredholm (1900), who first solved, in a general way, the problem of Dirichlet (determine the electric potential inside a domain on the assumption that the limit values of the potential itself, when approaching the domain boundary, is known). Fredholm's solution was based on a transformation of the differential problem into a boundary integral equation in terms of a double-layer of charges distributed on the boundary, thus giving rise to a new research field, characterized by the purpose of obtaining a solution of the boundary value problems without making an explicit reference to what happens in the interior of the domain, at least until the solution procedure is completed. Part I of the present paper is dedicated to the general theory. In particular, sect. 1 gives an elementary introduction to the so-called BEM "direct approach" (which has often replaced the original method of Fredholm) as applied to the neutron diffusion equation and points out some general features of BEM, as compared with FEM. In the same section the two calculation levels of the method, when considering reactor criticality problems, are specified. Namely, the "cell level", in which the BEM technique is applied to a reactor cell, to yield the outgoing partial currents as a response to the inward currents that are injected into the cell boundary, and the "reactor level", in which the classical Response Matrix method is adopted to connect all the cells of the system and give the final results in terms of the effective multiplication factor and the overall flux distribution. The application of the theory of boundary integral equations to a multigroup diffusion system in a homogeneous cell is dealt with in detail in sect. 2. Part II is dedicated to the approximate procedure to numerically solve such boundary integral equations. The moment method has been chosen (sect. 1), since this method, although it implies a very exacting analytic work, does not incur into any difficulty as it regards the boundary singularities, like edges and vertices. The case of a cell with the shape of a prism with a square base, as typical for a square <b>reactor</b> <b>lattice,</b> is treated in sect. 2, where in particular it is shown that the fourfold basic integrals that represent the reciprocal influence of two faces of the prism (via the integral kernel) can be performed very efficiently, without having recourse to more than a few 1 D numerical quadratures. Sect. 3 shows how the set of these basic integrals can be translated into a similar set consisting of Legendre-weighted integrals, which are better suited for applying the moment method other than for taking advantage of the symmetry properties of the problem. The Part III of this report will deal first with the description of the algebraic issues involved in the creation of the nodal response matrix starting from the basic integrals and exploiting the above 4 mentioned symmetry properties to reduce, together with the application of the theory of the circulant matrices, the calculation burden. Finally, Part IV will provide some details on the iterative procedure settled up in order to solve criticality search problems for systems with cubic cells, focused on the verification of the consistency of the method without care on the execution time. Numerical results will be, in particular, reported as it concerns the IAEA 2 D and 3 D LWR benchmark problem...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of the {{intracellular}} {{distribution of}} the activation of foils by neutrons were made in lattices of 1 / 4 -inch diameter, 1. 03 % U- 235, uranium rods moderated by heavy water, with bare and cadmium-covered foils of gold, depleted uranium, lutetium, europium and copper. The measurements {{were made in the}} M. I. T. Heavy Water Lattice Facility with source neutrons from the M. I. T. <b>Reactor.</b> Two <b>lattices</b> were studied in detail in this work. The more closely packed lattice had a triangular spacing of 1. 25 inches, and the less closely packed lattice had a triangular spacing of 2. 5 inches. The results of the experiments were compared to one-dimensional, 30 -energy group, THERMOS calculations based on the available energy exchange kernels. The comparison indicated that the approximation that the hexagonal cell may be replaced by an equivalent circular cell (the Wigner-Seitz approximation) can lead to serious discrepancies in closely packed lattices moderated b! y heavy water. A modified one-dimensional, and a two-dimensional, calculation were shown to predict the intracellular activation distribution in the closely packed lattice. An analytical treatment of the problem of the flux perturbation in a foil was developed and compared to the experimental results obtained by using gold foils of four different thicknesses in the lattice cell; the method was shown to be adequate. An analytical method to treat the effect of leakage from an exponential assembly was formulated; the results indicated that only in small exponential assemblies would leakage be a significant problem in intracellular flux measurements. A method was developed to predict the cadmium ratio of the foils used in the lattice cell; comparison with available measurements with gold foils indicated good agreement between theory and experiment, except for a lattice having very large ratios of moderator volume, to fuel volume, e. g., 100 : 1. Calculations of the fuel disadvantage factor by the method of successive generations for gold, lutetium and europium detector foils were compared to the results of THERMOS calculations, because THERMOS was shown to predict the experimental distributions. The comparison indicated that the method of successive generations is a good alternative to the THERMOS calculation, if all that is required is 17 and the thermal utilization.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of using a Wigner-Seitz (WS) cell with an adjusted moderator thickness to produce more accurate resonance self-shielded cross sections for light water <b>reactor</b> (LWR) <b>lattices.</b> The WS approximation has been commonly used in lattice physics calculations for many decades regardless that it has been shown to underestimate k-eff for an infinite LWR lattice by several hundred pcm. The WS cell moderator thickness was adjusted in order make the WS cell Dancoff correction match that for the square unit cell. It was shown that the effectiveness of this method is sensitive to the Dancoff correction which was being calculated from the real three-dimensional geometry because in practice users commonly employ unconverged values for the Dancoff correction. For an infinite lattice the Dancoff adjusted Wigner-Seitz cell (DAWSC) resulted in small improvements in k-eff (- 20 pcm) and reaction rates when using converged Dancoff corrections, however much larger improvements in values (up to 220 pcm) were seen for unconverged values of Dancoff corrections. When the DAWSC method was applied to a boiling water reactor (BWR) bundle, k-eff was worse for the DAWSC cases then for the normal WS cell treatment relative to continuous energy results. Improvements were seen in U 238 absorption reaction rates for DAWSC cases in the inner fuel pins of the bundle; however the results were the opposite for fuel pins on the outer edges of the bundle. These results showed that the DAWSC method failed to account for irregularities in the bundle for the Dancoff corrections that were calculated. The Dancoff correction calculation sequence was evaluated against CASMO 4 e. Good agreement (- 0. 34 % difference) was seen for infinite lattices, however large variations (+ 5 % to - 4 %) were seen among neighboring pins in a BWR lattice. These results for Dancoff correction prediction along with the significant improvements seen in k-eff for infinite lattices using unconverged Dancoff corrections implies that the DAWSC method may work if given the correct values for Dancoff corrections. The originally intended use for a Dancoff correction was to adjust the fuel escape probability for a particular energy group. Conversely, the application of DAWSC uses a single Dancoff correction to effectively change the fuel escape probability for all energy groups. A method for calculating an appropriate Dancoff correction for use in the DAWSC method should be investigated. by Thomas Hayward Roomy. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a tool called TXSAMC (Transport Cross Sections from Applied Monte Carlo) that produces shielded and homogenized multigroup cross sections for small fast reactor systems. The motivation for this tool {{comes from a}} desire to investigate reactor systems that are not characterized well by existing tools. Proper investigation usually {{requires the use of}} deterministic codes to characterize the timedependent reactor behavior and to link reactor neutronics codes with thermal-hydraulics and/or other physics codes. Deterministic codes require an accurate set of multigroup cross section libraries. The current process for generating these libraries is time consuming. TXSAMC offers a shorter route for generating these libraries. TXSAMC links three external codes together to create these libraries. The code creates an MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle) model of the reactor and calculates the zoneaveraged scalar flux in various tally regions and a core-averaged scalar flux tallied by energy bin. The core-averaged scalar flux provides a weighting function for NJOY. The zone-averaged scalar flux data is used in TRANSX for homogenization and shielding. The code runs NJOY to produce multigroup cross sections that are tabulated by nuclide, temperature and background cross section in MATXS (Material-wise cross section) format. This library is read by TRANSX which, in conjunction with the RZFLUX (Regular Zone-averaged Flux) files, shields the cross sections and homogenizes them. The result is a macroscopic cross section for the cell within the reactor from which the RZFLUX file was written. The cross sections produced by this process have been tested in five different sample problems and {{have been shown to be}} reasonably accurate. For reactor cells containing fuel pins, the typical error in the overall fission, nusigf, (n, 2 n), absorption and total RRD is only a few percent and is often less than one percent. It appears that the error is less for hexagonal lattices than for square lattices. A significant amount of error is associated with threshold reactions like (n, 2 n) in the sodium coolant. For the square lattice test problems, a reduction in error occurs when smaller tally regions are selected. This reduction was not observed for hexagonal <b>lattice</b> <b>reactors.</b> Overall, the cross sections produced by TXSAMC performed very well...|$|R
40|$|Safety {{analyses}} of a proliferation resistant, economically competitive, high conversion, {{boiling water reactor}} (HCBWR) fueled with fissile plutonium and fertile thorium oxide fuel elements, and with passive safety systems are presented here. The HCBWR developed here {{is characterized by a}} very tight lattice with a relatively small water volume fraction in the core which therefore operates with a fast reactor neutron spectrum, and a considerably improved neutron economy compared to the current generation of Light Water <b>Reactors.</b> The tight <b>lattice</b> core has a very narrow flow channels with a hydraulic diameter {{less than half of the}} regular BWR core and, thus, presents a special challenge to core cooling, because of reduced water inventory and high friction in the core. The primary safety concern when reducing the moderator to fuel ratio and when using a tightly packed lattice arrangement is to maintain adequate cooling of the core during both normal operation and accident scenarios. In the preliminary HCBWR design, the core has been placed in a vessel with a large chimney section, and the vessel is connected with Isolation Condenser System (ICs). The vessel is placed in containment with Gravity Driven Cooling System (GDCS) and Passive Containment Cooling System (PCCS) in a configuration similar to General Electric's Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR). The safety systems are similar to SBWR; ICs and PCCS are scaled with power. An internal recirculation pump was placed in the downcomer to augment the buoyancy head provided by the chimney, since the buoyancy provided by the chimney alone could not generate sufficient recirculation in the vessel as the tight lattice configuration resulted in much larger friction in the core than the SBWR. The constitutive relationships for RELAP 5 were assessed for narrow channels, and as a result the heat transfer package was modified. The modified RELAP 5 was used to simulate and analyze two of the most limiting events for a tight pitch lattice core: the Station Blackout and the Main Steam Line Break events. The results of the analyses indicate that the HCBWR system will be safely brought to the shutdown condition for these transients...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the neutronic {{analysis}} of plutonium recycle assemblies {{has been developed}} with emphasis on relative power distribution prediction in the boundary area of vastly different spectral regions. Such regions are those of mixed oxide (Pu 0 2 in natural U 02) fuel pins relative to enriched uranium pins, or water regions relative to fuel pin regions. The basic analytical methods for determination of spectrum averaged constants are given in the following descriptions: (1) Generalized Mixed Number Density (GMND) group constants (based on Breen's Mixed Number Density Method) are generated by {{a modified version of}} the spectrum code LASER, called LASER-M. (2) THERMOS Corrected LASER-M (TCL) group constants are based on mixed oxide- uranium oxide and water region boundary modeling in one dimensional (slab) geometry with the integral transport code THERMOS. The LASER-M model, as modified by addition of ENDF/B-II thermal cross sections for the plutonium isotopes, is used to predict the criticality of experimental lattices of U 02 - 2 w/o Pu 0 2, and fair agreement is shown. LASER-M unit cell depletion calculations with Yankee Core I data (3. 4 w/o U- 235) to 40, 000 MWD/MT and Saxton Core II data (6. 6 w/o Pu 02 in natural U 02) to 20, 000 MWD/MT show good isotopic agreement. Saxton Critical <b>Reactor</b> Experiment (CRX) <b>lattice</b> cores (19 x 19 rod array) consisting of a single fuel type region (mixed oxide or uranium oxide) or multiregions of both pin types were analyzed for relative power distribution comparisons. Cores with water slot regions were included. LASER-M Normal, LASER-M GMND and TCL two group constants were used with PDQ- 7 in the calculations. GMND results were in excellent agreement compared to the good agreement of TCL for these cases of isolated spectral disturbances in an asymptotic core region. The methods were applied to a proposed plutonium recycle "island design" assembly in which a large control rod water region is in close proximity to a zoned mixed oxide region. The TCL method yielded significantly greater power peaking and mixed oxide region average power owing to the spectral influence of the water region explicitly accounted for in this method. Such a result is consistent with published calculations. It is concluded that infinite lattice spectrum calculations are insufficient to deal with spectrum effects more complex than those in the Saxton CRX experiments.

40|$|Propane {{conversion}} to propylene {{has been the}} subject of intensive researches. This is due to the increasing demand for propylene. Current propylene production processes suffer from several limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is a promising alternative technology for propylene production overcoming the drawbacks of current processes. However, selectivity control in ODH is still a challenge preventing it from an industrial application. This is due to the formation of undesired carbon oxides. Thus, the development of a selective catalyst is crucial for the commercialization of ODH. Vanadium oxide catalysts have been proposed as the most active and selective catalyst for propane ODH. Moreover, new reactor concepts such as fluidized-bed might also help to make the ODH a feasible alternative for olefins productionas, offering some outstanding advantages in comparison to conventional reactors. This dissertation provides fundamental understanding of structure-reactivity relationship of vanadium oxide catalyst for propane ODH in a fluidized-bed <b>reactor</b> using the <b>lattice</b> oxygen of vanadium oxide catalysts in the absence of gas-phase oxygen. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts with different vanadium loadings (5 - 10 wt %) supported on γ-Al 2 O 3 is used. The prepared catalysts are characterized using several techniques such as BET surface area, H 2 -TPR, NH 3 -TPD, O 2 Chemisorption, Laser Raman Spectroscopy, Pyridine FTIR and XRD. Characterization of the catalysts reveals that monomeric VOx species are predominant at low vanadium loadings while polymeric VOx species increase with higher loadings until monolayer surface coverage is reached. Moreover, the catalysts display moderated acidity compared to that of the bare alumina due to the relative increase in the number of Brønsted acid sites. Successive-injections propane ODH experiments in the CREC Riser Simulator over partially reduced catalyst show good propane conversions (12 %- 15 %) and promising propylene selectivity (68 - 86 %) at 475 - 550 0 C. Product selectivities are found to augment with the catalyst’s degree of reduction suggesting that a certain degree of catalyst reduction is required for better propylene selectivity. Compared to average propylene yields of 5 % and 15 % obtained in FCC and steam cracking technologies, respectively, promising value of 7 % was obtained in the present propane ODH study over vanadium oxide catalyst and under oxygen free conditions. Such result would encourage further investigation of propane ODH in the absence of molecular gas oxygen as promising alternative/supplementary technology for the production of propylene. A kinetic model relating reaction rate to the catalyst’s degree of oxidation is proposed. Non- linear regression leads to model parameters with low confidence intervals, suggesting the adequacy of the proposed model in predicting the ODH reaction under the selected reaction conditions...|$|R
40|$|The OSMOSE program aims at {{improving}} the neutronic predictions of advanced nuclear fuels through measurements in the MINERVE facility at the CEA-Cadarache (France) on samples containing the following separated actinides: Th- 232, U- 233, U- 234, U- 235, U- 236, U- 238, Np- 237, Pu- 238, Pu- 239, Pu- 240, Pu- 241, Pu- 242, Am- 241, Am- 243, Cm- 244 and Cm- 245. The {{goal of the}} experimental measurements is to produce a database of reactivity-worth measurements in different neutron spectra for the separated heavy nuclides. This database can then {{be used as a}} benchmark for integral reactivity-worth measurements to verify and validate reactor analysis codes and integral cross-section values for the isotopes tested. In particular, the OSMOSE experimental program will produce very accurate sample reactivity-worth measurements for a series of actinides in various spectra, from very thermalized to very fast. The objective of the analytical program is {{to make use of the}} experimental data to establish deficiencies in the basic nuclear data libraries, identify their origins, and provide guidelines for nuclear data improvements in coordination with international programs. To achieve the proposed goals, seven different neutron spectra can be created in the MINERVE facility: UO 2 dissolved in water (representative of over-moderated LWR systems), UO 2 matrix in water (representative of LWRs), a mixed oxide fuel matrix, two thermal spectra containing large epithermal components (representative of under-moderated reactors), a moderated fast spectrum (representative of fast reactors which have some slowing down in moderators such as lead-bismuth or sodium), and a very hard spectrum (representative of fast reactors with little moderation from reactor coolant). The different spectra are achieved by changing the experimental lattice within the MINERVE <b>reactor.</b> The experimental <b>lattice</b> is the replaceable central part of MINERVE, which establishes the spectrum at the sample location. This configuration leads to a uniform well-behaved system so that the reactor configuration is in the fundamental mode. In fact, an important property of the oscillation experiments performed in the OSMOSE program is that the neutron flux at the sample location has reached the asymptotic fundamental mode of the MINERVE lattice. This property allows the use of simple spatial methods for the analysis (e. g. a lattice code with axial buckling representing the leakage), without loss of accuracy. The computational challenge is then reduced to the need of an appropriate cross-section processing and of accurate resonance shielding algorithms. In the present study, calculations have been performed to investigate the similarity of the flux spectra at the sample position of different OSMOSE configurations with the neutron energy distributions characterizing existing thermal and fast reactors proposed under the advanced reactor programs Gen-IV, GNEP and NGNP...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of the {{research}} on the thermodynamic properties of thorium salt and aims to provide a C++ 11 code to simulate fuel salt flow at various temperatures around a settling sphere and inside a container. This thesis should form the basis of a C++ 11 implementation on fuel salt flow in the Molten Salt Fast <b>Reactor</b> using the <b>Lattice</b> Boltzmann Method. The research into the thermodynamic properties of the thorium fuel salt is necessary in the research and development of new Generation IV Molten Salt Fast Reactors. The simulation uses the Lattice Boltzmann Method in the C++ 11 code language and the Palabos open-source library which are introduced in chapter 1. The governing equations in this simulation are the dynamics of the sphere, the Lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE) and the boundary method equations as presented in chapter 2. The boundary condition chosen for this thesis is the Guo extrapolation method with the Inamuro iteration to determine the fluid force and torque on the sphere. These models were chosen since they existed in the Palabos library and were used in 3 D moving wall examples. Since there was no documentation available from Palabos on the off-lattice 3 D methods, building the model proved to be time consuming and was a trial and error process. The resulting code as shown by chapter 3 is still a work in progress. The challenge was to combine both a settling sphere or in other words a moving wall with fluid wall interactions, in 3 D and inside an enclosed container (hence no infinite flow in any direction and a second boundary). Due to the complex nature of the problem and the lack of documentation, time ran out before results could be obtained. If the model would have generated results these would have needed to be verified and validated as presented by chapter 4. The intended simulation presented in chapter 5 was a settling sphere inside a cylindrical container with simulations for varying temperatures and Reynolds numbers. As stated earlier the model did not obtain results but the project did as stated in chapter 6, namely a good understanding of modelling fuels salts with C++ and the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) Palabos library is obtained. Therefore in chapter 7 it is recommended: to either update the palabos library and expand the documentation, resulting in a library owned and maintained by Delft University of Technology for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) in C++, or choose a different library entirely. Any such library should {{make the most of the}} advantage that the LBM has, namely that it is a very parallel method. Proper documentation and coding standards should be implemented keeping the library readable and understandable. Hence the conclusion in chapter 8 is that the Palabos library might prove a good solution in the future if modified and documented. More research on different boundary conditions and their performance is required. More research is also required on the performance of the Palabos library compared to other libraries. Finally a performance analysis for hardware and parallelisation methods would be required to make a decision on improvements in that department.
