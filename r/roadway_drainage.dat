The effect for preventing the gas accumulation at the upper corner of the coalface was significant. The drainage rate in the goaf reached 40  % of total gas emission in the goaf, achieving a zero overlimit, and ensuring a safe and smooth face advance.

Storm runoff which has moved across roadsides recently treated with soil-applied herbicides may transport herbicide residues to basins, where there is the potential for herbicide transport to ground water by soil infiltration of accumulated water. This study was conducted to determine the presence of soil-applied herbicide residues in water and soil samples at three Caltrans infiltration basins in San Joaquin County. Water samples were collected from an inflow canal delivering runoff to a basin, from basin storage, and from basin drywells. Soil at each basin was sampled at 1 -foot increments.

40|$|With over 68 {{thousand}} miles of gravel roads in Iowa {{and the importance}} of these roads within the farm-to-market transportation system, proper water management becomes critical for maintaining the integrity of the roadway materials. However, the build-up of water within the aggregate subbase can lead to frost boils and ultimately potholes forming at the road surface. The aggregate subbase and subgrade soils under these gravel roads are produced with material opportunistically chosen from local sources near the site and, many times, the compositions of these sublayers are far from ideal in terms of proper water drainage with the full effects of this shortcut not being fully understood. The primary objective of this project was to provide a physically-based model for evaluating the drainability of potential subbase and subgrade materials for gravel roads in Iowa. The Richards equation provided the appropriate framework to study the transient unsaturated flow that usually occurs through the subbase and subgrade of a gravel road. From which, we identified that the saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks, was a key parameter driving the time to drain of subgrade soils found in Iowa, thus being a good proxy variable for accessing roadway drainability. Using Ks, derived from soil texture, we were able to identify potential problem areas in terms of <b>roadway</b> <b>drainage.</b> It was found that there is a threshold for Ks of 15 cm/day that determines if the roadway will drain efficiently, based on the requirement that the time to drain, Td, the surface roadway layer does not exceed a 2 -hr limit. Two of the three highest abundant textures (loam and silty clay loam), which cover nearly 60 % of the state of Iowa, were found to have average Td values greater than the 2 -hr limit. With such {{a large percentage of the}} state at risk for the formation of boils due to the soil with relatively low saturated hydraulic conductivity values, it seems pertinent that we propose alternative design and/or maintenance practices to limit the expensive repair work in Iowa. The addition of drain tiles or French mattresses my help address drainage problems. However, before pursuing this recommendation, a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis is needed...|$|E
40|$|In 2004 - 2005, a new highway bypass was {{constructed}} through {{an area of}} predominantly upland forest with many vernal pools in southern New Hampshire. The highway is complete but is not yet open to traffic. Potential im¬pacts to vernal pool amphibians (spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frogs (Rana sylvatica)) and their habitat include habitat loss, barriers to animal movements, potential mortality on roads, and changes in water quantity and quality in breeding pools. Measures to maintain viable vernal pool-breeding amphibian populations along the bypass were implemented and monitored. Effectiveness as used in this paper refers {{to the ability of}} the various mitigation measures to contribute to the overall goal of maintaining viable populations, as well as the ability of each measure to provide its specific functions. The mitigation measures and results of their effectiveness to date include: • Bridges: Two bridges were constructed for general wildlife habitat connectivity. • Wildlife crossing structure and diversion walls: A 1. 2 m by 1. 2 m (4 ’ by 4 ’), 17 -m (55 ’) long concrete box culvert and diversion walls were installed. After three years of monitoring spring amphibian migrations, it appears the diversion wall is successfully diverting the few vernal pool-breeding amphibians that encounter it, but there is no evidence the crossing structure has been used. • Seasonal pool construction: Two new pools were constructed in an effort to maintain viable amphibian habitat and populations {{on both sides of the}} new road. Post-construction monitoring shows the new pools are used by a relatively diverse community of amphibians (including spotted salamanders in one pool) and macroinvertebrates, although the pools’ long-term value to vernal pool amphibians is not yet certain. • Drainage: Natural hillside drainage was maintained across the new roadway to maintain existing vernal pool hydrology to the extent feasible. Where possible, <b>roadway</b> <b>drainage</b> was routed to swales and detention basins that discharged outside of vernal pool watersheds. Based on two years of observations, vernal pools immediately adjacent to the roadway have been hydrologically altered, but other pools do not appear to have been affected by the changes. • Habitat preservation: The land around the greatest concentration of existing vernal pools, all on one side of the new highway, was purchased to preserve habitat integrity. Six years of pre-construction and two years of post-construction monitoring show that spotted salamander breeding (as measured by egg mass counts) has not changed substantially compared to pre-construction levels. However, there is a great deal of variation in breeding activity from year to year and pool to pool, and longer-term monitoring may reveal different trends. Opening the highway to traffic may also affect populations...|$|E
40|$|On February 3, 1999, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13112 (E. O.) {{which calls}} on state {{transportation}} agencies {{to work to}} prevent and control the introduction and spread of invasive species. Nonnative flora and fauna can cause significant changes to ecosystems, upset the ecological balance, and cause economic harm to our nation’s transportation, environmental, agricultural and recreational sectors. For example, introduced plants, such as Phragmites and purple loosestrife, throughout New York State have choked out native plant species and consequently clogged <b>roadway</b> <b>drainage</b> ways and altered environmental habitat. Transportation systems can facilitate the spread {{of plant and animal}} species outside their natural range. Those species that are likely to harm the environment, transportation safety, human health, or economy are of particular concern. The NYS Department of Transportation maintains approximately 16, 500 miles of highway and annually spends over $ 9. 1 million on vegetation management. Funding for this project is integretated as part of the normal department operational vegetation management budget. The threat from invasive species is increasing with human population growth, global trade and disturbance of the environment. Effectively dealing with the problem of invasive plant species presents a significant conservation challenge, both biologically and politically. The prevention of new plant invasions, early detection and monitoring of infestations of invasive plants, and effective control of established invasions through area-wide partnerships have been identified as key objectives in an overall national strategy for invasive plants. Stopping potentially invasive species before they spread from transportation corridors may be the best option for short-term protection. The department is implementating a proactive environmental initiative to attempt to eradicate certain existing invasive populations, and control the colonization and spread of species that have demonstrated negative effects to natural systems. Highway corridors provide opportunities for the movement of invasive species through the landscape. Invasive plant or animal species can move on vehicles and in the loads they carry. Invasive plants can be moved from site to site during spraying and mowing operations. Weed seed can be inadvertently introduced into the corridor during construction on equipment and through the use of mulch, imported soil or gravel, and sod. Some invasive plant species might be inadvertently planted in erosion control, landscape, or wildflower projects. Thousands of miles of New York State rights-of-ways traverse public and private lands. Many of these adjacent lands have weed problems and the highway rights-of-way provide corridors for further spread. NYSDOT has an opportunity to address roadside vegetation management issues on both their construction activities and maintenance programs with new levels of cooperation and communication with other state agencies and conservation organizations. Under the E. O., Federal-aid and Federal Lands Highway Program funds cannot be used to carry out actions that are likely to cause or promote the introduction or spread of invasive species in the United States or elsewhere unless all reasonable measures to minimize risk of harm have been analyzed and considered. NYSDOT plans on implementing a 10 -point invasive transportation vegetation management plan consisting of the following components: (1) Developing a prioritized list of threatening flora or fauna based upon regional environments. (2) Field and GIS mapping of existing invasive populations. (3) Integration of invasive species identification and analysis as part of the department’s normal NEPA /SEQR processing. (4) Evaluation of potential impacts caused by construction or maintenance activities. (5) Development of preventive best management practices. (6) Testing, execution and evaluation of eradication measures. (7) Annual reviews and updates of the vegetation management plans. (8) Progression of innovative design solutions to reduce the opportunities for the introduction or spread of invasive species. (9) Promote a climate of interagency cooperation and sharing of coordinated research with public and private sectors. (10) Increase employee and public knowledge through outreach training of the effects of invasive species to the users. An important design component of the plan is consideration of invasive species during all phases of the environmental process. For example, during scoping, discussions with stakeholders should identify the potential for impacts from invasive species and include possible prevention and control measures. The actual NEPA analysis should include identification of any invasive terrestrial or aquatic animal or plant species that could do harm to native habitats within the project study area. In summary, the NYSDOT is committed to the integration of E. O. 13112 as part of the department’s planning, design, construction and operations programs. This E. O. came at an opportune time to become another facet of the department’s nationally recognized transportation environmental initiative...|$|E

40|$|Disallowed gas {{concentration}} (DGC), i. e., a cease in production due to {{gas concentration}} exceeding the allowable limits, occurs frequently {{during the initial}} mining phase of longwall faces in Yangquan Coalfield, and seriously affects safety. The mechanism of DGC during the initial mining phase of longwall face is determined by analyzing the outflow behavior of methane. The results show that mining can induce ground movement and lead to pressure relief, leading to desorption and migration of the gas in the adjacent seams. Gas drainage from the high-level gas <b>drainage</b> <b>roadway</b> is unsuccessful because it is normally located too high to connect to vertical broken crevices of overlying strata {{in a timely manner}} during the initial mining phase, subsequently, the released methane from adjacent seams flows into the goaf. This results in the occurrence of DGC at the longwall face. Thus, based on the analysis of overlying strata movement and the flow characteristics of gas from adjacent seams, we propose an adjacent seams gas drainage technique of a large-diameter blind shaft joined to the high-level gas <b>drainage</b> <b>roadway</b> (LDBS-HGDR) for the initial mining phase. A computational fluid dynamics simulation was conducted to obtain the optimal design of the layout parameters for the LDBS-HGDR at Panel 15201.

By the end of 2012, the number of gas incidents had dropped to five, and none occurred in 2013.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} reduce {{spontaneous}} combustion in goaf at high methane mine, spontaneous oxidation zone distribution in goaf under methane stereo drainage is numerically studied by Fluent software. For the actual case of 8403 working face in Yang-Quan, According to the combination of gas velocity and oxygen concentration distribution, the oxidation zone distribution of horizontal and vertical surfaces are determined. The results shows that the distribution of spontaneous oxidation zone is asymmetrically at horizontal surfaces, the width of spontaneous oxidation zone of inlet side is wider than outlet side; at the vertical surfaces, the spontaneous oxidation zone is below 20 meters. By the contrast of the numerical oxygen concentration and measured oxygen concentration, good agreement is obtained, which shows that the numerical results is reliable. The methane concentration distribution shows that inner tail-roadway can effectively reduce methane concentration at working face's upper corner, and high <b>drainage</b> <b>roadway</b> can reduce methane concentration in the whole goaf...|$|R
50|$|The Moorings was the {{conception}} of Francis Henry Hawkes, a developer who purchased the estate of Charles Lanier Lawrance in 1962. Francis Hawkes, his wife Jean Whiting Hawkes, and his five children lived in the home until Francis retired and moved {{with his wife and}} youngest child to Arizona. The home passed through many hands and was divided and in turn developed, but Charles Lawrence's home still stands and is owned by Donald and Lynn Zergebel. The estate originally belonged to famed Wall Street banker, H. B. Hollins and was landscaped by the famous Olmsted Brothers. Hawkes improved upon the site by constructing <b>roadways,</b> curbs, bulkheading, <b>drainage,</b> and waterways connecting to a private yacht marina. He also enforced strict stipulations to maintain the characteristic beauty and dignity of the lush bayside wooded acreage; land was sold at acre minimum and no two estates could be of generic plans nor could they be of similar plans within the gates.|$|R
40|$|East Okoboji Beach was platted on April 20, 1961 and {{includes}} over 90. 4 acres with 489 lots. The East Okoboji Beach project includes a complete {{storm water discharge}} system, which includes low impact development and reconstruction of the roadways in East Okoboji Beach. The East Okoboji Beach Project is an enormous project {{that is the first}} Dickinson County project to retrofit LID practices, lake-friendly storm-water <b>drainage</b> systems and <b>roadway</b> reconstruction throughout an existing sub- division. This cooperative project between DNR, Dickinson County, and EOB landowners includes engineering retention ponds, rain gardens, bio-swales and other LID practices to reduce nutrient and sediment pollutants flowing directly into East Okoboji. The nature of the problem stems back to that original plat where small lots were platted and developed without planning for storm water discharge. There was no consideration of the effects of filling in and developing over the many wetland areas existing in EOB. The scope of the problem covers the entire 90. 4 acres in East Okoboji Beach, the DNR owned land and the farmed land to the east. The nature of the problem stems from storm water runoff flowing throughout the watershed and into East Okoboji Beach where it flows down self-made paths and then into East Lake Okoboji. That storm water runoff dumps nutrient and sediment pollutions directly into East Lake Okoboji. The expected result of this project is a new <b>roadway</b> and <b>drainage</b> system constructed with engineering that is intended to protect East Lake Okoboji and the land and homes in East Okoboji Beach. The benefit will be the improvement in the waters and the reduction of the siltation in the East Lake Okoboji...|$|R
40|$|As coal {{resources}} become exhausted {{in shallow}} mines, mining operations will inevitably progress from shallow depth to deep and gassy seams {{due to increased}} demands for more coal products. However, during the extraction process of deeper and gassier coal seams, new challenges to current gas control methods have emerged, these include {{the conflict between the}} coal mine safety and the economic benefits, the difficulties in reservoirs improvement, as well as the imbalance between pre-gas <b>drainage,</b> <b>roadway</b> development and coal mining. To solve these problems, a sequential approach is introduced in this paper. Three fundamental principles are proposed: the mining-induced stress relief effect of the first-mined coalbed should be sufficient to improve the permeability of the others; the coal resource of the first-mined seams must be abundant to guarantee the economic benefits; the arrangement of the vertical wells must fit the underground mining panel. Tunlan coal mine is taken as a typical example to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. The approach of integrating surface coalbed methane (CBM) exploitation with underground gas control technologies brings three major benefits: the improvement of underground coal mining safety, the implementation of CBM extraction, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This practice {{could be used as a}} valuable example for other coal mines having similar geological conditions...|$|R
