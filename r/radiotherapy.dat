5|$|<b>Radiotherapy</b> {{is often}} given {{together}} with chemotherapy, {{and may be}} used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who {{are not eligible for}} surgery. This form of high-intensity <b>radiotherapy</b> is called radical <b>radiotherapy.</b> A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated <b>radiotherapy</b> (CHART), in which a high dose of <b>radiotherapy</b> is given in a short time period. Postoperative thoracic <b>radiotherapy</b> generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC. Some people with mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement might benefit from post-operative <b>radiotherapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} {{in less time than}} other <b>radiotherapy</b> techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each <b>radiotherapy</b> dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the <b>radiotherapy</b> clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E
5|$|If cancer growth blocks a short {{section of}} bronchus, {{brachytherapy}} (localized <b>radiotherapy)</b> {{may be given}} directly inside the airway to open the passage. Compared to external beam <b>radiotherapy,</b> brachytherapy allows a reduction in treatment time and reduced radiation exposure to healthcare staff. Evidence for brachytherapy, however, is less than that for external beam <b>radiotherapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Patients {{receiving}} brachytherapy {{generally have}} to make fewer visits for <b>radiotherapy</b> compared with EBRT, and overall <b>radiotherapy</b> treatment plans can be completed in less time.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} pneumonectomy for lung cancer {{was performed in}} 1933. Palliative <b>radiotherapy</b> has been used since the 1940s. Radical <b>radiotherapy,</b> initially used in the 1950s, {{was an attempt to}} use larger radiation doses in patients with relatively early-stage lung cancer, but who were otherwise unfit for surgery. In 1997, continuous hyperfractionated accelerated <b>radiotherapy</b> was seen as an improvement over conventional radical <b>radiotherapy.</b> With small-cell lung carcinoma, initial attempts in the 1960s at surgical resection and radical <b>radiotherapy</b> were unsuccessful. In the 1970s, successful chemotherapy regimens were developed.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant <b>radiotherapy</b> is {{commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam <b>radiotherapy</b> (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. External beam <b>radiotherapy</b> involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant <b>radiotherapy</b> are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.|$|E
5|$|Avoidance of risk factors, {{including}} {{smoking and}} air pollution, {{is the primary}} method of prevention. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend {{on the type of}} cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and <b>radiotherapy.</b> NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and <b>radiotherapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|For both NSCLC and SCLC patients, smaller {{doses of}} {{radiation}} {{to the chest}} {{may be used for}} symptom control (palliative <b>radiotherapy).</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{potentially}} curable SCLC cases, chest <b>radiotherapy</b> {{is often}} recommended {{in addition to}} chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|It {{is used in}} {{external}} beam <b>radiotherapy,</b> sterilization of medical supplies and medical waste, radiation treatment of foods for sterilization (cold pasteurization), industrial radiography (e.g. weld integrity radiographs), density measurements (e.g. concrete density measurements), and tank fill height switches. The metal has the unfortunate property of producing a fine dust, causing problems with radiation protection. Cobalt from <b>radiotherapy</b> machines has been a serious hazard when not discarded properly, {{and one of the}} worst radiation contamination accidents in North America occurred in 1984, when a discarded <b>radiotherapy</b> unit containing cobalt-60 was mistakenly disassembled in a junkyard in Juarez, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Many {{brachytherapy}} {{procedures are}} performed on an outpatient basis. This convenience {{may be particularly}} relevant for patients who have to work, older patients, or patients who live some distance from treatment centres, {{to ensure that they}} have access to <b>radiotherapy</b> treatment and adhere to treatment plans. Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures can also help improve the efficiency of <b>radiotherapy</b> clinics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Radiotherapy</b> {{can also}} be used before surgery in certain cases. When {{pre-operative}} imaging or clinical evaluation shows tumor invading the cervix, radiation can be given before a total hysterectomy is performed. Brachytherapy and EBRT {{can also be}} used, singly or in combination, when there is a contraindication for hysterectomy. Both delivery methods of <b>radiotherapy</b> are associated with side effects, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|The {{phosphor}} {{has potential}} applications in personal dosimetry, dosimetry and imaging in <b>radiotherapy,</b> and medical imaging.|$|E
5|$|Because denser {{materials}} absorb more radioactive emissions than lighter ones, {{heavy metals}} {{are useful for}} radiation shielding and to focus radiation beams in linear accelerators and <b>radiotherapy</b> applications.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-60 has a {{radioactive}} half-life of 5.27years. The loss of potency requires periodic {{replacement of the}} source in <b>radiotherapy</b> and {{is one reason why}} cobalt machines have been largely replaced by linear accelerators in modern radiation therapy.|$|E
5|$|However, in locally {{advanced}} tumours, surgery may not routinely {{provide the}} best chance of cure and is often not technically feasible to perform. In these cases <b>radiotherapy,</b> including brachytherapy, offers the only chance of cure.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Harrison was {{diagnosed}} with throat cancer and treated with <b>radiotherapy,</b> which was {{thought at the time}} to be successful. He publicly blamed years of smoking for the illness.|$|E
5|$|In SCLC, {{chemotherapy}} and/or <b>radiotherapy</b> {{is typically}} used. However {{the role of}} surgery in SCLC is being reconsidered. Surgery might improve outcomes when added to chemotherapy and radiation in early stage SCLC.|$|E
5|$|Prophylactic cranial {{irradiation}} (PCI) {{is a type}} of <b>radiotherapy</b> to the brain, used {{to reduce}} the risk of metastasis. PCI is most useful in SCLC. In limited-stage disease, PCI increases three-year survival from 15% to 20%; in extensive disease, one-year survival increases from 13% to 27%.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy and, to {{a lesser}} extent, <b>radiotherapy</b> {{are likely to be}} offered to most people, whether or not surgery is possible. Specialists advise that the {{management}} of pancreatic cancer should {{be in the hands of}} a multidisciplinary team including specialists in several aspects of oncology, and is, therefore, best conducted in larger centers.|$|E
5|$|Esophageal strictures {{are usually}} benign and {{typically}} develop after {{a person has}} had reflux for many years. Other strictures may include esophageal webs (which can also be congenital) and damage to the esophagus by <b>radiotherapy,</b> corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic esophagitis. A Schatzki ring is fibrosis at the gastro-esophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic anemia, and Plummer-Vinson syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} {{may arise from}} a tumor {{compressing}} or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response. Most chronic (long-lasting) pain {{is caused by the}} illness and most acute (short-term) pain is caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures. However, <b>radiotherapy,</b> surgery and chemotherapy may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{improvements}} in targeting and imaging {{have led to}} the development of stereotactic radiation in the treatment of early-stage lung cancer. In this form of <b>radiotherapy,</b> high doses are delivered over a number of sessions using stereotactic targeting techniques. Its use is primarily in patients who are not surgical candidates due to medical comorbidities.|$|E
5|$|The {{radioisotope}} iridium-192 {{is one of}} the {{two most}} important sources of energy for use in industrial γ-radiography for non-destructive testing of metals. Additionally, 192Ir is used as a source of gamma radiation for the treatment of cancer using brachytherapy, a form of <b>radiotherapy</b> where a sealed radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Specific treatments include high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy, bilary duct brachytherapy, and intracavitary cervix brachytherapy.|$|E
25|$|Radiation therapy can be {{delivered}} by external beam <b>radiotherapy,</b> brachytherapy (internal <b>radiotherapy),</b> or by intra-operative <b>radiotherapy</b> (IORT). In the case of external beam <b>radiotherapy,</b> X-rays are delivered from outside the body by a machine called a Linear Accelerator or Linac. In contrast, brachytherapy involves the precise placement of radiation source(s) directly at the treatment site. IORT includes a one-time dose of radiation administered with breast surgery. Radiation therapy {{is important in the}} use of breast-conserving therapy because it reduces the risk of local recurrence.|$|E
25|$|In stage 1c and 2 cancers, {{radiation}} therapy is used after surgery {{if there is}} the possibility of residual disease in the pelvis but the abdomen is cancer-free. <b>Radiotherapy</b> can also be used in palliative care of advanced cancers. A typical course of <b>radiotherapy</b> for ovarian cancer is 5 days a week for 3–4 weeks. Common side effects of <b>radiotherapy</b> include diarrhea, constipation, and frequent urination.|$|E
25|$|Anal {{cancer is}} {{investigated}} by biopsy {{and may be}} treated by excision and <b>radiotherapy,</b> or with external beam <b>radiotherapy</b> and adjunctive chemotherapy. The five-year survival rate with the latter procedure is above 70%.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear-powered {{submarine}} {{core meltdown}} and other mishaps include the K-19 (1961), K-11 (1965), K-27 (1968), K-140 (1968), K-429 (1970), K-222 (1980), and K-431 (1985). Serious radiation accidents include the Kyshtym disaster, Windscale fire, <b>radiotherapy</b> accident in Costa Rica, <b>radiotherapy</b> accident in Zaragoza, radiation accident in Morocco, Goiania accident, radiation accident in Mexico City, <b>radiotherapy</b> unit accident in Thailand, and the Mayapuri radiological accident in India.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiotherapy</b> also {{relies on}} ROS {{toxicity}} to eradicate tumor cells. <b>Radiotherapy</b> uses X-rays, γ-rays {{as well as}} heavy particle radiation such as protons and neutrons to induce ROS-mediated cell death and mitotic failure.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to surgery, <b>radiotherapy</b> {{becomes the}} {{mainstay}} of treatment for people with glioblastoma. It is typically performed along with giving temozolomide (TMZ). A pivotal clinical trial {{carried out in the}} early 1970s showed that among 303 GBM patients randomized to radiation or nonradiation therapy, those who received radiation had a median survival more than double those who did not. Subsequent clinical research has attempted to build on the backbone of surgery followed by radiation. On average, <b>radiotherapy</b> after surgery can reduce the tumor size to 107 cells. Whole-brain <b>radiotherapy</b> does not improve when compared to the more precise and targeted three-dimensional conformal <b>radiotherapy.</b> A total radiation dose of 60–65 Gy {{has been found to be}} optimal for treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiotherapy</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} at Maternity Hospital in 1976 utilising radium needle treatment. CT and Nuclear Medicine was introduced in 1988 at Bir Hospital. The <b>Radiotherapy</b> unit with Tele Cobalt-60 machine was established at Bir Hospital in 1991.|$|E
25|$|New {{technology}} has also allowed more precise delivery of <b>radiotherapy</b> in a portable fashion mdash& {{for example in}} the operating theatre. Targeted intraoperative <b>radiotherapy</b> (TARGIT) is a method of delivering therapeutic radiation from within the breast using a portable X-ray generator called Intrabeam.|$|E
25|$|Carboplatin {{has also}} been used for {{adjuvant}} therapy of stage 1 seminomatous testicular cancer. Research has indicated {{that it is not}} less effective than adjuvant <b>radiotherapy</b> for this treatment, while having fewer side effects. This has led to carboplatin based adjuvant therapy being generally preferred over adjuvant <b>radiotherapy</b> in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|The main {{treatment}} modalities are surgery, embolization and <b>radiotherapy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Modern, {{advanced}} <b>radiotherapy</b> {{techniques such}} as proton and charged particle <b>radiotherapy</b> enable superior precision in the dose delivery and spatial distribution of the effective dose. Today, those possibilities add new challenges to IGRT, concerning required accuracy and reliability. Suitable approaches are therefore a matter of intense research.|$|E
25|$|Radiation therapy {{can be used}} as part of the {{palliative care}} of {{advanced}} ovarian cancer, since it can help to shrink tumors that are causing symptoms. Palliative <b>radiotherapy</b> typically lasts for only a few treatments, a much shorter course of therapy than non-palliative <b>radiotherapy.</b> It is also used for palliation of chemotherapy-resistant germ cell tumors.|$|E
