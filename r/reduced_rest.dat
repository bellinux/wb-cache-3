40|$|Circadian {{rhythms and}} rest {{homeostasis}} are independent processes, each regulating important components of rest-activity patterns.

Throughout the animal kingdom, there exists a huge variation in rest-activity patterns, yet {{it is unclear how}} these behaviors have evolved. Here we show that four species of balitorid cavefish have greatly <b>reduced</b> <b>rest</b> times in comparison to rest times of their surface relatives. All four cave species retained biological rhythmicity, and in three of the four there is a pronounced 24 -hour rhythm; in the fourth there is an altered rhythmicity of 38 - 40 hours.

Taken together, our data suggest that consistent reduction in total rest times were accomplished evolutionarily through alterations in rest homeostasis...|$|E
30|$|Mechanistically, non-neuronal {{cells are}} kept from {{becoming}} neurons by a {{negative feedback loop}} in which REST prevents {{the expression of a}} large number of neuronal-specific TFs as well as miR- 124 (Xue et al. 2013). Interestingly, while miR- 124 is able to target REST in such loop, such targeting is potently suppressed by PTB in non-neuronal cells via direct competition of miR- 124 targeting on multiple REST components, including a key REST subunit SCP 1, a Pol II phosphatase (Xue et al. 2013; Yeo et al. 2005). Thus, the presence of PTB prevents the effect of precociously induced miR- 124. During neuronal induction, increased miR- 124, which likely results from signal-induced transcription in the brain, will target PTB to reduce its expression. Therefore, when PTB inactivation is experimentally induced by RNAi, such negative REST/miR- 124 loop is converted to a positive one to allow miR- 124 to be more efficient in targeting REST and <b>reduced</b> <b>REST</b> further de-represses miR- 124.

50|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{the most}} common inherited cardiac disease, occurring in 1:500 individuals in the general population. It is estimated that there are 600,000 individuals in the United States with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The most common variant of HCM presents with left ventricular (LV) intracavitary obstruction due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and mitral-septal contact, diagnosed readily with echocardiography. Pharmacologic treatment with negative inotropic drugs is first-line therapy. Beta-blockers are used first, and while they improve symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain and exercise intolerance, they do not <b>reduce</b> <b>resting</b> LV intraventricular pressure gradients and often are inadequate to control symptoms. Many investigators and clinicians believe that disopyramide controlled release {{is the most}} potent agent available for <b>reducing</b> <b>resting</b> pressure gradients and improving symptoms. Disopyramide has been actively used for more than 30 years. Disopyramide administration for obstructive HCM has a IIa recommendation in the 2011 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation guidelines for treatment of obstructive HCM.

As a homolog of Drosophila minibrain gene, DYRK 1 A also plays important roles in neurodevelopment; however, the function and regulatory mechanism of DYRK 1 A in neurodevelopment remain elusive.

Here, we found that REST can activate DYRK 1 A transcription via a neuron-restrictive silencer element at bp − 833 to − 815 of human DYRK 1 A promoter. The coordinated expression of DYRK 1 A and REST in mouse brain further supports the cross-interaction of DYRK 1 A and REST during neurodevelopment. Moreover, we showed that DYRK 1 A dosage imbalance <b>reduced</b> <b>REST</b> protein stability and transcriptional activity through facilitating ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of REST protein. Therefore, the regulation of DYRK 1 A by REST in a negative feedback loop suggests that DYRK 1 A and REST are closely related in neurodevelopment...|$|E
40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} {{that patients with}} chronic coronary artery disease can experience prolonged regional ischemic dysfunction that does not necessarily arise from irreversible tissue damage and, to some extent, can be reversed by restoration of blood flow. Recent clinical and experimental data suggest that this form of chronic but reversible left ventricular dysfunction represents a complex, progressive, and dynamic phenomenon. The initial stages of dysfunction are probably caused by chronic stunning. They are characterized by normal resting perfusion but reduced flow reserve, mild myocyte alterations, maintained membrane integrity (allowing the transport of both thallium and glucose), preserved capacity to respond to an inotropic stimulus, and no or little tissue fibrosis. After revascularization, functional recovery will probably be rapid and complete. On the other hand, the more advanced stages of dysfunction likely correspond to chronic hibernation. They usually are associated with <b>reduced</b> <b>rest</b> perfusion; increased tissue fibrosis; more severe myocyte alterations (degeneration[?], apoptosis); and a decreased {{ability to respond to}} inotropic stimuli.

40|$|K nABSTRACT Background: Pressure {{overload}} {{leads to}} cardiac hypertrophy, {{which is often}} followed by heart failure. We tested the hypothesis that depressed contractility in this process results from an imbalance in Ca 2 transport by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 ATPase (SERCA) and the sarcolemmal Na/Ca 2 exchanger (NCX). Methods and Results: Left ventricular (LV) myocytes (n 79) from 12 normal (N) and 5 hypertrophied (LVH, by aortic banding) feline hearts were studied. Adenoviral gene transfer was used to introduce green fluorescent protein (GFP), SERCA 2, and NCX into N and LVH myocytes. Contraction (videomicroscopy) and Ca 2 transients (Fluo- 3) were measured in steady state and after rest periods of 2 to 120 seconds (rest decay and potentiation). LVH hearts were significantly larger than N (7. 1 1. 4 versus 4. 2 0. 2 g/kg). SERCA protein was significantly less abundant in LVH versus N. Steady state contractions and Ca 2 transients of LVH-GFP myocytes decayed more slowly and rest decay of contractility was more pronounced compared with N-GFP.

Thirteen participants volunteered for a 4 -week crossover training study, involving three sessions per week (each session involving 4 Ã— 2 min bilateral-leg isometric exercise). The training intensity used (95 % peak HR) was equivalent to 24 % MVC. In addition to blood pressure, resting heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance were measured.

Material and methodsEleven extremities (six patients) with Buerger's disease were treated with the intramedullary Kirschner wire technique. Inclusion criteria were chronic critical ischemia, Rutherford Grade II or III, with major arterial occlusion shown by Doppler examination and angiography; failure to respond to non-surgical and surgical treatment; and the need for strong analgesics.

40|$|REST (RE 1 {{silencing}} transcription factor), {{also known}} as NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencer factor), is well-known as a transcriptional repressor of neural genes in non-neural tissues. Dysregulation of REST activity is thought {{to play a role}} in diverse diseases including cardiac hypertrophy, Down Syndrome, Huntington's disease and cancer. Previous studies examining the pluripotency transcriptional network in mouse as well as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have revealed that REST is regulated by the pluripotency factors OCT 4, NANOG and SOX 2. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the role of REST in hESCs. An inducible REST knockdown system was used to examine growth and differentiation over short and long-term culture. Interestingly, altering REST levels in multiple hESC lines did not result in loss of self-renewal, but instead led to aneuploidy. During differentiation, <b>reduced</b> <b>REST</b> levels led to altered MAPK/ERK and WNT signaling, as well as upregulation of endoderm and mesoderm markers. Critical hurdles for the translation of the clinical potential of hESCs into practice are their tumorigenic capacity, and the inefficiency in tailoring lineage differentiation. Elucidating the role of REST in regulating cell fate and genetic stability of hESCs could enable development of robust methods to stably culture and tailor lineage differentiation of these cells for use in regenerative medicine applications...|$|E

Intraarterial administration of BM-MNC did not significantly increase ankle-brachial index and, thus, the trial missed its primary end point. However, cell therapy was associated with significantly improved ulcer healing (ulcer area, 3. 24. 7 cm 2 to 1. 893. 5 cm 2 [P 0. 014] versus placebo, 2. 923. 5 cm 2 to 2. 894. 1 cm 2 [P 0. 5]) and <b>reduced</b> <b>rest</b> pain (5. 21. 8 to 2. 21. 3 [P 0. 009] versus placebo, 4. 52. 4 to 3. 92. 6 [P 0. 3]) within 3 months.

40|$|The twitch force (Ft) -interval {{relation}} of cardiac muscle reflects recovery of calcium {{release from the}} sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The calcium content of the SR {{is thought to be}} reflected by force developed during a contracture (Fc), induced by rapid cooling to near 0 °C. In right ventricular trabeculae of rat, under control conditions, the Ft-interval relation consisted of recovery of Ft to steady state (early recovery), followed by a secondary increase of Ft up to a maximum at an interval of- 100 seconds (rest potentiation) and a decline of Ft at intervals> 100 seconds (rest depression). The mechanisms that may underlie recovery of force after the last twitch at short intervals are 1) time-dependent transport of Ca 2 ' from the uptake compartment of the SR to the release compartment, 2) recovery of slow inward Ca 2 ' current during the action potential, and 3) recovery of the Ca 2 ' release channels in the SR. The Fc-interval relation was similar to the Ft-interval relation in that both a rest potentiation and a rest depression phase were present. However, at short interstimulus intervals (< 1 second), Fc was independent of time, suggesting that the mechanism underlying early recovery was bypassed.

We {{examined}} the antianginal and anti-ischemic effects of oral zatebradine, a direct sinus node inhibitor {{that has no}} blood pressure-lowering or negative inotropic effects in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris taking extended-release nifedipine. Background. Heart rate reduction is considered an important pharmacologic mechanism for providing anginal pain relief and anti-ischemic action in patients with chronic stable angina, suggesting a benefit for sinus node-inhibiting drugs. Methods. In a single-blind placebo run-in, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, patients already receiving extended-release nifedipine (30 to 90 mg once a day) were randomized to receive zatebradine (5 mg twice a day [n = 64]) or placebo (n = 60). All subjects had reproducible treadmill exercise-induced angina at baseline, and after randomization they performed a serial exercise test 3 h after each dose for 4 weeks. Results. Zatebradine <b>reduced</b> <b>rest</b> heart rate both at 4 weeks ([mean ± SEM] 12. 9 ± 1. 23 vs. 2. 3 ± 1. 6 [placebo] beats/min, p < 0. 0001) {{and at the end}} of comparable stages of Bruce exercise (16. 7 ± 1. 2 vs. 3. 4 ± 1. 2 [placebo] beats/min, p < 0. 0001). Despite the significant effects on heart rate at rest and exercise, there were no additional benefits of zatebradine from placebo baseline in measurements of total exercise duration, time to 1 -mm ST segment depression or time to onset of angina. Subjects taking zatebradine also had more visual disturbances as adverse reactions. Conclusions. Zatebradine seems to provide no additional anti-anginal benefit to patients already receiving nifedipine, and it raises questions regarding the benefit of heart rate reduction alone as an antianginal approach to patients with chronic stable angina...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} cerebral mechanisms {{explaining the}} effects of dopamine on rest tremor in Parkinson's disease. Background: Resting tremor in Parkinson's disease is related to altered activity in the basal ganglia and in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Dopaminergic medication <b>reduces</b> <b>resting</b> tremor in some patients, but many patients have a dopamine-resistant tremor. The cerebral mechanisms underlying the effect of dopamine on resting tremor, and the large inter-individual differences in this effect, are unexplained. Methods: Here we investigated the influence of dopaminergic medication on tremor-related activity and effective connectivity, using combined EMG-fMRI recordings in 15 tremor-dominant Parkinson patients that were measured {{both on and off}} dopamine. Building on a recently developed model of Parkinson's tremor, we distinguished between BOLD signals associated with tremor initiation (in the basal ganglia) and tremor amplification (in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit). Results: We found that dopaminergic medication reduced tremor initiation-related activity in the globus pallidus, and tremor amplification-related activity in the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM). Network analyses with dynamic causal modeling showed that dopamine specifically increased thalamic self-inhibition, but only in patients with a clinically dopamine-responsive tremor. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that dopamine <b>reduces</b> <b>resting</b> tremor by potentiating inhibitory mechanisms in the thalamic VIM nucleus.

Our results revealed that RSV significantly decreased REST gene and protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Interestingly, overexpression of SIRT 1 <b>reduced</b> <b>REST</b> expression, whereas EX- 527, an inhibitor of SIRT 1, increased REST expression and blocked RSV-induced REST downregulation. These results suggest that RSV downregulates REST through SIRT 1. In addition, RSV enhanced activator protein 1 (AP- 1) transcription factor c-Jun expression and its binding to the REST promoter gene. Indeed, c-Jun knockdown reverted RSV-induced REST downregulation. Intriguingly, in SH-SY 5 Y cells and rat cortical neurons the NDL PCB- 95 induced necrotic cell death in a concentration-dependent manner by increasing REST mRNA and protein expression. In addition, SIRT 1 knockdown blocked RSV-induced neuroprotection in rat cortical neurons treated with PCB- 95. Collectively, these results indicate that RSV via SIRT 1 activates c-Jun, thereby reducing REST expression in SH-SY 5 Y cells under physiological conditions and blocks PCB- 95 -induced neuronal cell death by activating the same SIRT 1 /c-Jun/REST pathway...|$|E
40|$|Endothelial {{dysfunction}} {{has been}} linked to a decrease in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and attenuated endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) -mediated relaxation. The small (SK(Ca)) and intermediate (IK(Ca)) calcium-activated potassium channels {{play a key role in}} endothelium-dependent relaxation. Because the repressor element 1 -silencing transcription factor (REST) negatively regulates IK(Ca) expression, we hypothesized that augmented REST and decreased IK(Ca) expression contributes to impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation associated with hypertension. Acetylcholine (ACh) responses were slightly decreased in small mesenteric arteries from male stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs) versus arteries from Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. Incubation with N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 100 mu mol/L) and indomethacin (100 mu mol/L) greatly impaired ACh responses in vessels from SHRSP. lberiotoxin (0. 1 mu mol/L), which is a selective inhibitor of large-conductance K(Ca) (BK(Ca)) channels, did not modify EDHF-mediated vasodilation in SHRSP or WKY. UCL- 1684 (0. 1 mu mol/L.), which is a selective inhibitor of SKCa channels, almost abolished EDHF-mediated vasodilation in WKY and decreased relaxation in SHRSP. 1 -((2 -chlorophenyl) diphenylmethyl) - 1 H-pyrazole (TRAM- 34; 10 mu mol/L) and charybdotoxin (0. 1 mu mol/L), which are both IKCa inhibitors, produced a small decrease of EDHF relaxation in WKY but completely abrogated EDHF vasodilation in SHRSP. EDHF-mediated relaxant responses were completely abolished in both groups by simultaneous treatment with UCL- 1684 and TRAM- 34 or charybdotoxin. Relaxation to SK(Ca) /IK(Ca) channels agonist NS- 309 was decreased in SHRSP arteries. The expression of SK(Ca) was decreased, whereas IK(Ca) was increased in SHRSP mesenteric arteries. REST expression was reduced in arteries from SHRSP. Vessels incubated with TRAM- 34 (10 mu mol/L) for 24 h displayed <b>reduced</b> <b>REST</b> expression and demonstrated no differences in IK(Ca). In conclusion, IK(Ca) channel upregulation, via decreased REST, seems to compensate deficient activity of SK(Ca) channels in the vasculature of spontaneously hypertensive rats.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) {{is common}} and symptoms can be debilitating and lethal. Risk management, exercise, radiological and surgical intervention are all valuable therapies, but {{morbidity and mortality}} rates from this disease are increasing. Circulatory enhancement can be achieved using simple medical electronic devices, with claims of minimal adverse side effects. The evidence for these is variable, prompting {{a review of the}} available literature. METHODS: Embase and Medline were interrogated for full text articles in humans and written in English. Any external medical devices used in the management of peripheral arterial disease were included if they had objective outcome data. RESULTS: Thirty-one papers met inclusion criteria, but protocols were heterogenous. The medical devices reported were intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), electronic nerve (NMES) or muscle stimulators (EMS), and galvanic electrical dressings. In patients with intermittent claudication, IPC devices increase popliteal artery velocity (49 - 70  %) and flow (49 - 84  %). Gastrocnemius EMS increased superficial femoral artery flow by 140  %. Over 4. 5 - 6 months IPC increased intermittent claudication distance (ICD) (97 - 150  %) and absolute walking distance (AWD) (84 - 112  %), with an associated increase in quality of life. NMES of the calf increased ICD and AWD by 82  % and 61 - 150  % at 4 weeks, and 26  % and 34  % at 8 weeks. In patients with critical limb ischaemia IPC <b>reduced</b> <b>rest</b> pain in 40 - 100  % and was associated with ulcer healing rates of 26  %. IPC had an early limb salvage rate of 58 - 83  % at 1 - 3 months, and 58 - 94  % at 1. 5 - 3. 5  years. No studies have reported the use of EMS or NMES in the management of CLI. CONCLUSION: There is evidence to support the use of IPC in the management of claudication and CLI. There is a building body of literature to support the use of electrical stimulators in PAD, but this is low level to date. Devices may be of special benefit to those with limited exercise capacity, and in non-reconstructable critical limb ischaemia. Galvanic stimulation is not recommended...|$|E
