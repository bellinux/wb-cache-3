The resonant frequency of the noise <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> is tuned by a plurality of force transmitting mechanisms which contact the noise <b>radiating</b> <b>element.</b> Each one of the force transmitting mechanisms includes an expandable element and a spring in contact with the noise <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> so that excitation of the element varies the spring force applied to the noise <b>radiating</b> <b>element.</b> The elements are actuated by a controller which receives input of a signal proportional to displacement of the noise <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> and a signal corresponding to the blade passage frequency of the engine's fan.

The resonant frequency of the noise <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> is tuned by an expandable ring embedded in the noise <b>radiating</b> <b>element.</b> Excitation of the ring causes expansion or contraction of the ring, thereby varying the stress in the noise <b>radiating</b> <b>element.</b> The ring is actuated by a controller which receives input of a feedback signal proportional to displacement of the noise <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> and a signal corresponding to the blade passage frequency of the engine's fan. In response, the controller determines a control signal which is sent to the ring, causing the ring to expand or contract.

40|$|This thesis work is {{concerned}} with the design and performance analysis of purely textile antenna for wireless applications. The materials used for <b>radiating</b> <b>element,</b> ground plane and dielectric substrate are purely textile. Two types of antennas are studied, the microstrip patch antenna and RFID tag antenna. Each type of antenna is designed and fabricated using two different conductive textile materials as <b>radiating</b> <b>element.</b>  The <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> and ground plane of conventional printed antenna is manufactured with the metal plating on a solid dielectric substrate. The <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> which is used in this thesis work has different characteristics as compared to printed antenna because it is made of conductive textile material which is less conductive than metal and elastic in nature. Each conductive textile material has different surface resistivity. The study has been made to analyze the effect on gain and radiation efficiency of the antenna when different conductive textile material is used as the <b>radiating</b> <b>element.</b> The measured results of the fabricated antennas present the full potential of conductive textile materials to be used as an antenna...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe use of carbon-fiber tissue as a {{replacement}} for metal <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> has been investigated to fabricate microwave antennas embedded in composite material panels.

50|$|By {{combining}} {{two elements}} in this manner, one saves costs in manufacturing and saves real-estate in mounting the antenna.

50|$|The {{method of}} moments {{algorithm}} has practical limitations as well; the number of calculations required to model a three-dimensional structure of N <b>radiating</b> <b>elements</b> is roughly proportional to the cube of N. Modeling an antenna with 100 wire segments requires 1003 = 1 million calculations. Increasing the number of elements {{by a factor of}} 10 requires 10003 = 1 billion calculations, increasing the computing time by a factor of 1000, assuming the simulation completes at all given memory limitations and such. Consequently, there are other approaches such as geometric optics which are preferred for modeling large structures.|$|E
50|$|Antenna gain {{is closely}} related to {{directivity}} and often incorrectly used interchangeably. However, gain is always less than directivity by a factor called radiation efficiency, η. Whereas directivity is entirely a function of wavelength and the geometry and type of antenna, gain takes into account the losses that always occur in the real world. Specifically, accelerating charge (time varying current) causes electromagnetic radiation per Maxwell's equations. Therefore, antennas use a current distribution on <b>radiating</b> <b>elements</b> to generate electromagnetic energy that propagates away from the antenna. This coupling is never 100% efficient (by Laws of Thermodynamics), and therefore antenna gain will always be less than directivity by this efficiency factor.|$|E
