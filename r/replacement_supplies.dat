2500|$|Jet blast {{deflectors}} aboard {{aircraft carriers}} {{are placed in}} very {{close proximity to the}} [...] temperatures of modern jet fighter exhaust. The non-skid decking surface of the deflector suffers heat damage and requires frequent maintenance or replacement. Additionally, the hot deflector surface cannot be used as normal decking until it has cooled enough to allow aircraft tires to roll over it. To mitigate the heat problem, active cooling systems were installed in the 1970s, tapping the fire mains (fire suppression water systems) to use seawater circulating through water lines within the deflector panel. However, the water cooling system adds more complexity and failure points, and requires additional maintenance. The most recent method tried by the United States Navy for solving the heat problem was introduced in 2008 with USS George H.W. Bush which uses heavy-duty metal panels covered in heat-dissipating ceramic tiles similar to those used on the Space Shuttle. The tiled panels can be changed quickly and easily—the ship carries a large <b>replacement</b> <b>supply.</b> Without active water lines, the passively-tiled deflector is expected to require much less maintenance.|$|R

40|$|This study quantifies {{responses}} of isowean pigs (10 to 12 days of age, PIC breed) to potential in-transit temperature fluctuations for 54 h, {{followed by a}} 14 -day growth period under thermoneutrality. The 54 -h temperature regimens included a constant air temperature of 26. 7 °C (as control) and three cyclic air temperatures of 26. 7 ± 2. 8 °C, 26. 7 ± 5. 6 °C and 26. 7 ± 8. 3 °C, all using woodshavings bedding atop rigid board insulation. The pigs received an average dosage of 0. 91 kg/pig water <b>replacement</b> <b>supply</b> during the 54 -h treatment period, and ad-libitum feeding and watering during the growth period. Pigs in all three treatments and the control had similar growth performance, physiological, and energetic responses during both treatment and growth periods. At {{the end of the}} treatment period, the pigs had elevated concentrations of hematocrit, plasma protein, blood urea nitrogen, sodium and chloride, but declined concentration of glucose (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Potassium and bicarbonate levels remained relatively constant (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). Concentrations of the blood constituents returned to normal during the growth period. The results suggest that the isowean pigs respond well to air temperature fluctuations of up to ± 8. 3 °C around the thermoneutral condition of 26. 7 °C air temperature coupled with woodshavings bedding...|$|R
5000|$|Battles in the Mediterranean and North African theaters exposed {{numerous}} organizational {{weaknesses in}} the Army. Perhaps the most significant was the existence of separate, independent GHQ tank battalions. These units, considered inferior in maintenance and training to their counterparts in armored divisions, were usually quickly rotated between different infantry units, not only within a single division but among other divisions as well. At the small-unit level, this made {{the development of the}} teamwork and esprit so important {{to the success of the}} tank-infantry team almost impossible. Because of their independent existence, GHQ tank battalions lacked proper care and support. Outside of a regular division's personnel and supply channels, GHQ tank battalions suffered from lack of crew <b>replacements,</b> <b>supplies,</b> and spare parts. Unfortunately, GHQ tank battalions were often indifferently commanded, the best armor officers being chosen to command tank battalions within armored divisions. The problem of GHQ tank battalions was a sore one and accompanied the U.S. Army to the French mainland. - Michael D. Doubler, Busting the Bocage: American Combined Arms Operations in France, 6 June-31 July 1944, November 1988 The separate tank battalions performed well in Europe and Italy, but the priority for new equipment was given to the armored divisions first. This meant that these battalions were slow to receive upgraded equipment like the 76 mm Sherman and the new M24 Chaffee.|$|R
50|$|A {{more serious}} danger was the limited reserve {{of the water}} level, where the water level had only to drop by a small amount owing to {{inattention}} before the furnace crown would be exposed, with likely overheating and risk of boiler explosion. The boiler was safe when correctly fired, but could not be left unattended. These water level restrictions became even more troublesome when the boiler was tilted, even by {{as little as a}} steep railway line. An unusual rate of wear and number of <b>replacement</b> furnaces <b>supplied</b> for the Heywood locomotives has been put down to this cause.|$|R
