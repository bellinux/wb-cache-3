40|$|The {{collapse}} of the Palau Bridge in 1996 received considerable attention at the time, {{but there has been}} very little reported in the literature about the investigation of the collapse mechanism, partly because of a legal agreement between the parties involved. This paper has been prepared from publicly available sources to ensure that the wider structural engineering community learns something from the failure. Since the collapse occurred soon after a repair to the bridge, it has been widely assumed that the repair was the cause of the failure, but it is shown that this is very unlikely. Instead it is concluded that lack of robustness in the original design meant that the structure had always been vulnerable to accidental damage, which eventually occurred as part of the <b>resurfacing</b> <b>works...</b>|$|E
40|$|An Australian {{airport was}} to be resurfaced by asphalt overlay. The airport had {{experienced}} variable performance from similarly designed asphalt overlays in the past. Previous investigations had established that changes in the asphalt mastic had likely led {{to a lack of}} asphalt shear stress resistance. Various sources of fine aggregate and binder had been used in previous <b>resurfacing</b> <b>works.</b> Mastic combinations containing two specific fine aggregates sources and two specific binder sources resulted in variable asphalt performance. The two fine aggregates were similar except that one contained predominantly Hisingerite clay minerals, which had potentially detrimental properties. The two binder sources were the same grade of acid-modified bitumen manufactured from dif erent crude oil source blends with significantly dif erent properties. A combination of repeated shear stress testing of mastic and bitumen determined that both the fine aggregate and binder sources significantly af ected the mastic response to shear stress, and therefore expected asphalt shear resistance. No adverse impact associated with the Hisingerite-rich fine aggregate was found. The two sources of bitumen showed significantly dif erent properties. It was concluded that apparently similar fine aggregate and binder sources could have significant impact on mastic, and therefore asphalt, performance in high shear stress states during hot temperatures. It is recommended that the current Australian specifications for airport asphalt should be reviewed to prevent significantly dif erent surface performance from nominally identical and compliant mastic constituents...|$|E
40|$|In this {{document}} I have {{carried out a}} study of all the important points which might affect the operational safety of running-ins, landings and take offs of aircraft of F key on the cross runway 02 / 20 of the Barcelona - El Prat Airport. The reason for {{this study is that}} for a few days in the month of January 2017 runway 07 L/ 25 R has remained closed due to resurfacing of track and it has been necessary for airplanes to land and take off on the parallel track of the sea 07 R/ 25 L or do the landing by the crusade when <b>resurfacing</b> <b>works</b> permitted. Key F aircraft operating in the Barcelona - El Prat Airport are currently the A 380 and the B 747, but today {{there are more and more}} airline companies that include this type of aircrafts in its fleet since they perform new long-distance routes. The main objective is to study if the runway 02 / 20 is suitable for operation of A 380 aircraft and for this we have analysed the necessary requirements for this operation, identifying actions to be carried out (widening of taxiway, displace vertical signals, introduce any restrictions for span during running-in [...] .), so that this operation minimizes the operational security risks and without affecting the operation of the airport. During the study I have followed ICAO Annex 14 volume I of aerodromes and the A 380 safety studies in the Barcelona - El Prat Airport. The contents of memory are on the one hand, the current status of the operation of the A 380 by the parallel tracks of the Barcelona - El Prat Airport and on the other hand a proposal for design of runway and taxiways as well as a new proposal of running-in...|$|E

These are difficult to remove, leaving an unsightly [...] "footprint" [...] on walls, and possibly resulting in expensive <b>resurfacing</b> <b>work.</b> Additionally, ivy can quickly invade gutters and roofspaces, lifting tiles and causing blockages. It also harbors mice and other unwelcome creatures. The plants have to be cut off at the base, and the stumps dug out or killed to prevent regrowth.|$|R

50|$|Between Redmires Reservoir and Dennis Knoll car park, {{just north}} of Hathersage (a {{distance}} of approximately four km), Long Causeway still exists as an unsurfaced track. This track is a BOAT (Byway Open To All Traffic), however recently this has been subject to a Traffic Regulation Order from the Peak District National Park, and vehicles have been banned. Small areas of the track are still paved in parts with the most extensive section being a 20-metre stretch just {{to the west of}} Stanage Pole. In early 2013 Derbyshire County Council carried out some <b>resurfacing</b> <b>work</b> between Stanage Edge and Dennis Knoll car park, this resulted in many of the large boulders being removed, leaving a smooth surface for horse riders and walkers.
