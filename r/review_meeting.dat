25|$|The {{launch date}} of 24 February 2011 was officially set after the Flight Readiness <b>Review</b> <b>meeting</b> on 18 February 2011. Reviews of {{previous}} problems, including the GUP vent line connection, external tank foam and external tank stringer cracks, {{were found to}} be positive. Additionally, flight rules which required a 72-hour separation between dockings at the International Space Station threatened to delay the launch by at least a day due to the delayed launch of the ESA's unmanned Johannes Kepler ATV supply craft. Managers instead decided to press ahead with the countdown allowing for a possible standdown; had docking issues arisen with the ATV, STS-133 would have stood down for 48 hours. The Kepler ATV docked successfully at 10:59 UTC, 24 February 2011.|$|E
25|$|Further {{developments}} in rethinking strategies and approaches to achieving the MDGs include {{research by the}} Overseas Development Institute {{into the role of}} equity. Researchers at the ODI argued that progress could be accelerated due to recent breakthroughs in the role equity plays in creating a virtuous circle where rising equity ensures the poor participate in their country's development and creates reductions in poverty and financial stability. Yet equity should not be understood purely as economic, but also as political. Examples abound, including Brazil's cash transfers, Uganda's eliminations of user fees and the subsequent huge increase in visits from the very poorest or else Mauritius's dual-track approach to liberalization (inclusive growth and inclusive development) aiding it on its road into the World Trade Organization. Researchers at the ODI thus propose equity be measured in league tables in order to provide a clearer insight into how MDGs can be achieved more quickly; the ODI is working with partners to put forward league tables at the 2010 MDG <b>review</b> <b>meeting.</b>|$|E
25|$|A <b>review</b> <b>meeting</b> {{was held}} in May 2008, {{approximately}} 8 months after the restrictions began, which was attended by the Director of Liquor Licensing {{and members of the}} Aboriginal community. Oscar said the meeting was ‘the most important mins of our lives’. The views of people who attended were that women now felt more empowered, confident and able to participate in community-level discussions, the Valley was a much more quiet and safe place to live, and other Aboriginal communities had noticed the positive example set in the Valley. Alcohol restrictions had encouraged government and non-government agencies to become more involved, a strong desire to not return to the chaos of pre-restriction times prevailed, and change needed to be substantial and long lasting. The people felt priority needed to be given to children’s health and welfare, and they wanted the next generation of children to be raised without alcohol affecting their lives, families were stronger and sober, old people were being cared for, young people were thinking about buying homes, and children were learning new skills. They also believed sly grogging had become an issue, communities with people suffering from FASD needed help, and if the restrictions were lifted, all of the confidence that now existed in the community would be ‘stripped away’.|$|E

500|$|Wilde's {{friends had}} advised {{him against the}} {{prosecution}} at a Saturday <b>Review</b> <b>meeting</b> at the Café Royal on 24 March 1895; Frank Harris warned him that [...] "they are going to prove sodomy against you" [...] and advised him to flee to France. Wilde and Douglas walked out in a huff, Wilde saying [...] "it is at such moments as these that one sees who are one's true friends". The scene was witnessed by George Bernard Shaw who recalled it to Arthur Ransome {{a day or so}} before Ransome's trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Ransome it confirmed what he had said in his 1912 book on Wilde; that Douglas's rivalry for Wilde with Robbie Ross and his arguments with his father had resulted in Wilde's public disaster; as Wilde wrote in De Profundis. Douglas lost his case. Shaw included an account of the argument between Harris, Douglas and Wilde in the preface to his play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Kim Il-sung University in 1964, Kim Jong-il devoted himself to cultural, ideological and {{propaganda}} {{work at the}} Department of Organization and Guidance of the Central Committee of the party. Although Kim {{is known to have}} been privately interested in Hollywood films, he forbade discussion on foreign film concepts at the Aesthetic <b>Review</b> <b>Meeting,</b> an important annual film conference. After he had ordered the entire conference archive to be destroyed, Kim urged participants to be exclusively concerned with the teachings of Kim Il-sung and the party in creative work. Since then, Kim Jong-il's influence in film and literary administration grew, and he resisted liberal artistic influence from the de-Stalinizing Soviet Union. From 1968, Kim began to work on film adaptations of guerilla plays originating from the 1930s. Kim had personally guided the production of films, such as Sea of Blood, (parts one and two, 1969), The Fate of a Self-Defence Corps Man ( [...] , 1970) and The Flower Girl (1972). Afterwards, Kim Jong-il began producing revolutionary operas. Kim had worked in the government arts administration for almost ten years by this time. He then wrote a series of essays based on speeches he had given to directors and screenwriters over the preceding five years, and published it as On the Art of the Cinema on April 11, 1973. It was his first major work. Through the rest of the 1970s, Kim continued to oversee cultural activities.|$|E

2500|$|Fusion One Corporation is a US {{organization}} {{founded in}} 2015 by Dr. Paul Sieck, Dr. Scott Cornish and Randall Volberg. They {{are developing a}} magneto-electrostatic reactor named [...] "F1" [...] that is based in-part on the polywell. It introduces a system of externally mounted electromagnet coils with internally mounted cathode repeller surfaces that provide a new means of preserving energy and particle losses {{that would otherwise be}} lost through the magnetic cusps. In response to Todd Rider's 1995 power balance conclusions, a new analytical model was developed based on this recovery function as well as a more accurate quantum relativistic treatment of the bremmstralung losses that was not present in Rider's analysis, which relied on interpolation. The new model demonstrated ample multiples of net gain with D-T and sufficient multiples with D-D to be used for generating electricity. Prior to building a scale reactor, they are developing an HPC simulation and benchtop test device using a modified spindle cusp to validate these results. Fusion One presented their work at the ARPA-E ALPHA 2017 Annual <b>Review</b> <b>Meeting.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} candidate nursing diagnoses and queries raised during nursing diagnosis case study <b>review</b> <b>meetings</b> {{by considering the}} characteristics of the types of queries raised, their underlying circumstances, and the thought process involved. We also identified differences in queries between earlier and later case <b>review</b> <b>meetings</b> and trends during these two periods, and considered future approaches to educational support. We carried out analysis of summary records of discussions during case study <b>review</b> <b>meetings</b> held at Hospital A. The queries raised at the case study <b>review</b> <b>meetings</b> were classified according to thought processes rather than actual case contents. A total of 12 case studies were discussed, six during the first part and six during {{the second part of the}} study period. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the types of queries raised during each period. The Egawa diagnosis-oriented process (E-DOP) was used as the conceptual model for investigating differences in the types of query and their characteristics, and issues in the thought process were isolated. We found that the types of queries raised concerned clinical assessments of patients’ conditions, interrelated diagnoses that might occur simultaneously, candidate diagnoses at the screening stage, diagnoses indicating similar mental and physical functions or conditions, the distinction between nursing diagnoses and medical problems (complications), how to understand self-care deficit, and diagnoses for which guidance with a view to hospital discharge or family intervention would be appropriate. Our results suggest that these queries were associated with stages 3 (interpretation), 5 (analysis), and 6 (integration) in the E-DOP. Our results suggest that conceptual learning connected to case studies and a review of the content of case studies may be necessary, together with support for integrated approaches that account for the characteristics of each medical institution...|$|R
