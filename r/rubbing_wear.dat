40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of fric-tion stir welding (FSW) for joining of mild steel. Defect-free welds were produced on 0. 25 -in. plates (6. 3 mm) of hot-rolled AISI 1018 mild steel at travel speeds ranging from 1 to 4 in. /min (0. 42 to 1. 68 mm/s) using molybdenum-based and tungsten-based alloy tools. Results for welds made at 1 in. /min are reported here. Axial tool loads measured during FSW were approx-imately 4200 lbf (18. 7 kN), while mea-sured torques were {{in the range of}} 500 in. -lb (55 N•m). Peak surface tempera-tures close to 1000 °C (1832 °F) were mea-sured on the workpiece and tool during welding using thermocouples and an in-frared camera system. Comparisons be-fore and after welding combining both metallographic and metrology techniques suggest changes in tool dimensions stem from both <b>rubbing</b> <b>wear</b> and deformation of the tool. The greatest changes in tool di-mensions occurred during the initial plunging stage. Microstructures of the welds were examined using optical and scanning electron microscopy. The weld region displayed several microstructurally distinct regions. Extrapolation of mea-sured temperatures and microstructural evidence suggest peak temperatures of the stir zone exceeded 1100 °C (2012 °F) and likely surpassed 1200 °C (2192 °F). Trans-verse tensile properties of the welds were evaluated at room temperature. Welded samples failed in regions corresponding to the base metal and demonstrated yield and ultimate tensile strengths comparable to those of the base metal. Welded sam-ples passed bend tests to ~ 15 % strain in the outer fiber. The results have demon-strated the feasibility of FSW of steel with acceptable tensile properties. Based on these results, FSW of transformation-hardenable steels, HSLA steels, and stain-less steels appears feasible...|$|E

40|$|Scientists {{have long}} been able to shift the {{direction}} of a laser beam, steering it toward a target, but often the strength and focus of the light is altered. For precision applications, where the quality of the beam cannot be compromised, scientists have typically turned to mechanical steering methods, redirecting the source of the beam by swinging the entire laser apparatus toward the target. Just as the mechanical methods used for turning cars has evolved into simpler, lighter, power steering methods, so has the means by which researchers can direct lasers. Some of the typical contraptions used to redirect lasers are large and bulky, relying on steering gimbals pivoted, rotating supports to shift the device toward its intended target. These devices, some as large and awkward as a piece of heavy luggage, are subject to the same issues confronted by mechanical parts: Components <b>rub,</b> <b>wear</b> out, and get stuck. The poor reliability and bulk not to mention the power requirements to run one of the machines have made mechanical beam steering components less than ideal for use in applications where weight, bulk, and maneuverability are prime concerns, such as on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or a microscope. The solution to developing reliable, lighter weight, nonmechanical steering methods to replace the hefty steering boxes was to think outside the box, and a NASA research partner did just that by developing a new beam steering method that bends and redirects the beam, as opposed to shifting the entire apparatus. The benefits include lower power requirements, a smaller footprint, reduced weight, and better control and flexibility in steering capabilities. Such benefits are realized without sacrificing aperture size, efficiency, or scanning range, and can be applied to myriad uses: propulsion systems, structures, radiation protection systems, and landing systems...|$|R

Therefore, this review intends to highlight the state-of-the-art on materials and techniques that are used to fabricate wear resistant liquid repellent transparent coatings so that researchers can assess various aptitudes and limitations related to translating some of these technologies to large scale stain repellent outdoor applications...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSevere rubs between {{gas turbine}} blades and engine casings can {{in extreme cases}} result in {{damaging}} blade vibration levels and rapid loss of casing lining material.

Major rub events are extremely rare in practice, and there is seldom any useful diagnostic evidence of {{the root cause of}} the behaviour. Moreover, traditional analysis methods are not suitable for exploring the wide range of potential conditions under which an unstable vibration response might be initiated. A new modelling technique has been developed for modelling blade casing rubs which includes a detailed model of the interaction with liner wear. The method is time based, but is very efficient, enabling a wide range of initiating conditions to be explored. A series of examples have been developed to firstly: demonstrate the method is robust and reliable, and secondly: to investigate potential interaction phenomena under representative simulated conditions. The method has been applied to a real blade example, for which severe wear is known to have occurred. The method predicts that instability may occur above a threshold level of tip rub severity, and also demonstrates the improvement in an alternative blade design for which rub tolerance is known to be superior...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A new {{technique}} for the rotor whirl damping in rotating machinery, {{based on the}} elastic suspension of the journal boxes {{and the use of}} dry friction surfaces normal to the shaft axis between their supports and the frame, is here analysed theoretically for several cases of rotor systems characterized by mass and constraint asymmetry, where gyroscopic effects are to be expected and conical whirl motions may grow up. The critical flexural speeds can be easily cut off by an adhesive state of the supports and the whirl amplitude can be minimized as well throughout the remaining sliding range. Confining the operative angular speed of the rotor in the range of adhesive contact between the dry friction surfaces, no significant increase of power dissipation or heat production has to be ascribed as a whole to this type of suspension system, whose task is just to suppress the resonant peaks when passing the critical speeds. On the other hand, the <b>rubbing</b> surface <b>wear</b> can be easily compensated in the long run by use of suitable spring devices to close the friction contact. The uniqueness and the stability of the steady motion are proved, both in the absence and in the presence of possible additional viscous sources of dissipation. It is also shown how the destabilizing influence of the shaft material hysteresis can be counterbalanced by the other external dissipative forces. r 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Hand hygiene is {{recognized}} as an important measure to prevent healthcare-associated infections. Hand hygiene adherence among healthcare workers is associated with their knowledge and perception. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of three different educational programs on improving hand hygiene compliance, knowledge, and perception among healthcare workers in a tertiary care hospital in Indonesia. Methods The study was performed from May to October 2014 and divided into a pre-intervention, intervention, and post-intervention phase. This cluster randomized controlled trial allocated the implementation of three interventions to the departments, including role model training-pediatrics, active presentation-surgery, a combination of role model training and active presentation-internal medicine, and a control group-obstetrics-gynecology. Both direct observation and knowledge-perception survey of hand hygiene were performed using WHO tools. Results Hand hygiene compliance was observed during 2, 766 hand hygiene opportunities, and knowledge-perception was assessed among 196 participants in the pre-intervention and 88 in the post-intervention period. After intervention, the hand hygiene compliance rate improved significantly in pediatrics (24. 1 % to 43. 7 %; P[*]<[*] 0. 001), internal medicine (5. 2 % to 18. 5 %; P[*]<[*] 0. 001), and obstetrics-gynecology (10. 1 % to 20. 5 %; P[*]<[*] 0. 001). The nurses’ incorrect use of hand <b>rub</b> while <b>wearing</b> gloves increased as well (P[*]<[*] 0. 001). The average knowledge score improved from 5. 6 (SD[*]=[*] 2. 1) to 6. 2 (SD[*]=[*] 1. 9) (P[*]<[*] 0. 05).

30|$|The {{tribological}} {{behaviors of}} {{two types of}} seal coatings, nickel–graphite and aluminum–hexagon-boron nitride (Ni–Cg and Al–hBN, respectively) versus a Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade used in turbofan engines were investigated using a high-speed <b>rubbing</b> test. The <b>wear</b> status and damage mechanism of the friction couples were studied and the abradability of the seal coatings was evaluated. By analysis of the coating properties and damage mechanism of the seal couple, the friction heat effect was identified as the key factor influencing blade wear forms as well as coating abradability. A one-dimensional heat conduction model was established to estimate the effect of increasing temperature on the friction interface. The results indicated that in the Ni–Cg and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V seal couple, the temperature rising rate (TRR) of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was faster {{than that of the}} Ni–Cg coating, and so the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade softened earlier than the Ni–Cg coating, causing the blade to suffer severe wear. In the Al–hBN and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V seal couple, the TRR of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was slower than that of the Al–hBN coating, and so the Al–hBN coating softened first; thus, blade damage was reduced or even replaced by coating adhesion. The square root ratio of thermal diffusivity between the blade and the coating could be taken as an indicator of the ratio of TRR between the blade and coating to predict blade wear status as well as damage mechanism. The results of the model agreed well with the experiment results of the two seal couples used in this study.|$|R

However that might be, his curiosity was occupied rather with the conceivable hinge of poor Cornelia's: it was perhaps thinkable that even Mrs. Worthingham's New York, once it should have become possible again at all, might have put forth to this lone exile a plea that wouldn't be in the chords of Bognor.

He saw himself on the whole scrimping with more zest even in Mrs. Worthingham's New York than under the inspiration of Bognor. Apart from which it was yet again odd, not to say perceptibly pleasing to him, to note where the emphasis of his interest fell in this fumble of fancy over such felt oppositions as the new, the latest, the luridest power of money and the ancient reserves and moderations and mediocrities.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{synthesis}} of TiO 2 nanotubes by anodization provides outstanding properties to Ti surfaces intended for dental and orthopedic implants applications. Beyond the very well-known potential of these surfaces to improve osseointegration and avoid infection, the knowledge on the adhesion and degradation behavior of TiO 2 nanotubes under the simultaneous action of wear and corrosion is still poorly understood and these are issues of tremendous importance. The main aim of this work is to investigate, for the first time, the tribo-electrochemical degradation behavior of Ti surfaces decorated with TiO 2 nanotubes before and after biofunctionalization treatments. Well-aligned TiO 2 nanotubes (NTs) were produced containing elements natively present in bone such as calcium (Ca) and phosphorous (P), in addition of zinc (Zn) as an antimicrobial agent and stimulator of bone formation. The synthesis of Ca/P/Zn-doped nanotubes (NT-Ca/P/Zn) was achieved by reverse polarization and anodization treatments applied to conventional TiO 2 nanotubes grown by two-step anodization. The nanotube surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) while dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM-DF) was used to characterize the Ti/TiO 2 nanotubular films interfaces. Tribo-electrochemical tests were conducted under reciprocating sliding conditions in artificial saliva. The open circuit potential (OCP) was monitored before, during and after sliding tests, and the coefficient of friction (COF) values were registered during <b>rubbing</b> action. The <b>wear</b> tracks resulting from sliding tests were characterized by SEM and wear volume measurements were carried out by 2 D profilometry. The results show that the tribo-electrochemical behavior of TiO 2 nanotubes was significantly improved after bio-functionalization treatments. The higher electrochemical stability and lower mechanical degradation of these films was correlated with their improved adhesion strength to Ti substrate, which is granted by the nanothick oxide film formed at the interface region, during bio-functionalization processes. A first insight on the degradation mechanisms taking place during tribo-electrochemical action is proposed. The outcomes of this study may contribute in a great extent for the development of new implant surfaces with improved biomechanical stability and thus contribute for the long term success of dental implants. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxide film}} formed on {{metallic}} substrate during un-lubricated dry sliding {{is a critical}} factor affecting the wear resistance of the sliding components and the coefficient of friction. A healthy and well-maintained tribo-oxide layer kept with proper thickness and good surface conditions provides a solid sheet of lubrication between the rubbing pair by separating them from direct metallic contact and, thus preventing the sliding surfaces from severe damage. The {{purpose of this study}} is to further examine the relationship between the so-called protective tribo-glaze and the substrate underneath, such as the adhesion between the two components with different thermal expansion coefficients, the influence of growth of these oxide plateaux on the coefficient of friction and so forth. The adherence of an oxide layer onto the metallic substrate, mainly steels and cast irons, is reviewed. Hot compression and heat treatment were conducted on the samples tested using the Gleeble 3500 in this work. The sample is a composite material consisting of three layers, where the formability-poor cast iron is the core layer and low carbon steels are the outer layers. This sandwich-structural material is produced by hot rolling process through which the interface strengths between the cast iron and steels were greatly enhanced with a metallurgical bonding condition, after they were cast together, by pouring the molten steel which has a higher melting point into a casting device, followed by molten cast iron. The sliding wear test was carried out using CETR wear testing apparatus for three sample conditions of cast iron layer before they were cut from the cast iron layers. The three sample conditions are hot rolled sample that was hot rolled into composite with metallurgical bonding at a low carbon steel and cast iron interfaces, heat treated sample that was destabilised in the Gleeble 3500 at 1050 °C for 8 min in a vacuum after hot rolling, and hot compressed sample that was hot compressed in a vacuum (40 % reduction at a strain rate of 1 /s) in the Gleeble 3500 at 1050 °C for 8 min. The wear test on these three samples was conducted under dry sliding conditions at room temperature, after sliding parameters of 20, 40 N, and 45 and 78 mm/s were pre-set for different sliding tests in the CETR setup. Sliding durations of 7. 5 min and 2 min were selected for various testing conditions in this study. Optical microscope (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to observe the worn surfaces of these samples. After misalignment and running-in, it was found that the wear was always mild for all the testing conditions, due to the formation of oxide plateaux on the disc specimen, cast rubbed against the upper high chrome steel ball shaped specimen. When the load was increased to 40 N, a so-called negative wear response occurred on the heat treated sample and the hot compressed sample. However, the hot rolled sample failed to respond in a similar manner under the same sliding condition. The negative wear from these samples generally lasted for some 2 min, followed by a reverse trend where the displacement of the pin became positive, which is what happened to the hot rolled sample during the whole sliding period. A 2 -minute test was carried out on these samples. The results revealed that the worn surfaces of the heat treated and hot compressed samples were coated with a protective oxide plateau which contributed to a negative displacement of pins, which was ready to be break off due to their approach to the critical thickness determined by surface fatigue and their brittle nature. However, the worn surface of hot rolled sample was not covered with such a healthy protective film that was replaced by discontinuous oxide plateaux which had been spalled off during <b>rubbing</b> and oxidised <b>wear</b> debris dispersed ready to be compacted into glaze on the worn track. The differences of stabilities and maintenance of oxide layer formed on these samples were discussed. The relationship between the formation of an oxide layer on the heat treated and hot compressed samples and the coefficient of friction as a function of sliding time was also discussed. It was concluded that the lowering coefficient of friction caused by the formation and development of a protective oxide layer only operates when the surface is kept well before approaching its critical thickness at which the surface severely cracks and is shown as scales instead of a whole oxide continent. This shows that the development of wear resistance offered by this layer is not synchronised with its growth in height...|$|R
