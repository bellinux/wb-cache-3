5|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> uses {{radiation}} {{outside the}} visible range with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter. <b>Radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> {{is different from}} most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, radio {{emission}} from the Andromeda Galaxy {{was detected by}} Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard at Jodrell Bank Observatory.

The core of the Andromeda Galaxy is called 2C 56 in the 2C <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> catalog. In 2009, the first planet may have been discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy. This was detected using a technique called microlensing, which is caused by the deflection of light by a massive object.|$|E

5|$|Frances Elizabeth Somerville Alexander (née Caldwell; 13 December 1908 – 15 October 1958) was a British geologist, academic, and physicist, whose wartime {{work with}} radar and radio led to early {{developments}} in <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy.</b> Alexander earned her PhD from Newnham College, Cambridge, {{and worked in}} Radio Direction Finding at Singapore Naval Base from 1938 to 1941. In January 1941, unable to return to Singapore from New Zealand, she became Head of Operations Research in New Zealand's Radio Development Lab, Wellington. In 1945, Alexander correctly interpreted that anomalous radar signals picked up on Norfolk Island were caused by the sun. This interpretation became pioneering {{work in the field}} of <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy,</b> making her one of the first women scientists to work in that field, albeit briefly.|$|E

5|$|William I. McLaughlin {{proposed}} {{a new strategy}} {{in the search for}} extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) in 1977. He suggested that widely observable events such as nova explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronise the transmission and reception of their signals. This idea was tested by the National <b>Radio</b> <b>Astronomy</b> Observatory in 1988, which used outbursts of Nova Cygni 1975 as the timer. Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous radio signals coming from Epsilon Eridani.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{molecules}} exist in interstellar space, as can tiny 0.1μm dust particles. The tally of molecules discovered through <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> is steadily increasing {{at the rate}} of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the trihydrogen cation. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions.|$|E

5|$|After a rough {{position}} of the burst had been determined, Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale Frail at the National <b>Radio</b> <b>Astronomy</b> Observatory's Very Large Array. Frail began making observations at a wavelength of 20centimeters at 01:30UTC, less than four hours after the discovery. While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski, who was working with the Hale telescope. Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey, but he found no new sources of light within the error box. Mark Metzger, a colleague of Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory, conducted a more extensive analysis of the data, but was also unable to identify any new light sources.|$|E
5|$|There {{were large}} cost overruns with the {{telescope}}'s construction, mainly {{due to the}} steeply rising cost of steel {{at the time the}} telescope was constructed. The original grant for the telescope's construction came jointly from the Nuffield Foundation and the government; this amounted to £335,000. The government increased its share of the funding several times as the cost of the telescope rose; other money came from private donations. The final part of the debt from the construction of the telescope, £50,000, was paid off by Lord Nuffield and the Nuffield Foundation on 25 May 1960 (partly due to the telescope's early, very public role in space probe tracking; see below), and Jodrell Bank observatory was renamed to the Nuffield <b>Radio</b> <b>Astronomy</b> Laboratories. The final total cost for the telescope was £700,000.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Cold War era, {{radar and}} antenna related {{applications}} remained a prominent research activity in EES' {{contracts with the}} Defense Department.

EES' high-frequency radar research found applications in <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy,</b> meteorology and climate studies, which improved weather forecasting and climate models and assisted in NASA's planning of the Cassini and Galileo missions. Expansion of EES' antenna research in the 1970s, in particular, the development of an air defense antenna for the U.S. Army Missile Command, resulted in the establishment of the Huntsville Research Laboratory, GTRI's oldest off-campus research center.|$|E

5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, light does not travel along {{straight}} lines when it propagates in a gravitational field. Instead, it is deflected {{in the presence}} of massive bodies. In particular, starlight is deflected as it passes near the Sun, leading to apparent shifts of up 1.75 arc seconds in the stars' positions in the sky (an arc second is equal to 1/3600 of a degree). In the framework of Newtonian gravity, a heuristic argument can be made that leads to light deflection by half that amount. The different predictions can be tested by observing stars that are close to the Sun during a solar eclipse. In this way, a British expedition to West Africa in 1919, directed by Arthur Eddington, confirmed that Einstein's prediction was correct, and the Newtonian predictions wrong, via observation of the May 1919 eclipse. Eddington's results were not very accurate; subsequent observations of the deflection of the light of distant quasars by the Sun, which utilize highly accurate techniques of <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy,</b> have confirmed Eddington's results with significantly better precision (the first such measurements date from 1967, the most recent comprehensive analysis from 2004).|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{discovery}} of gamma-ray bursts, a general consensus arose within the astronomical community {{that in order to}} determine what caused them, they would have to be identified with astronomical objects at other wavelengths, particularly visible light, as this approach had been successfully applied to the fields of <b>radio</b> X-ray <b>astronomy.</b> This method would require far more accurate positions of several gamma-ray bursts than the Vela system could provide.
