[...] During the wet season, {{a combination of}} heavy rainfall and, in some places such as Hong Kong, an onshore wind, improve air quality. In Brazil, the wet season is correlated with weaker trade winds off the ocean. [...] The pH level of water becomes more balanced due to the charging of local aquifers during the wet season. Water also softens, as the concentration of dissolved materials reduces during the rainy season. Erosion is also increased during rainy periods. Arroyos that are dry at other {{times of the year}} fill with runoff, in some cases with water as deep as [...] Leaching of soils during periods of heavy rainfall depletes nutrients. The higher runoff from land masses affects nearby ocean areas, which are more stratified, or less mixed, due to stronger surface currents forced by the heavy <b>rainfall</b> <b>runoff.</b>|$|E

40|$|Instead of Fourier smoothing, {{this study}} applied wavelet {{denoising}} {{to acquire the}} smooth seasonal mean and corresponding perturbation term from daily <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> data in traditional seasonal models, which use seasonal means for hydrological time series forecasting. The denoised <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> time series data were regarded as the smooth seasonal mean. The probability distribution of the percentage coefficients {{can be obtained from}} calibrated daily <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> data. For validated daily <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> data, percentage coefficients were randomly generated according to the probability distribution and the law of linear proportion. Multiplying the generated percentage coefficient by the smooth seasonal mean resulted in the corresponding perturbation term. Random modeling of daily <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> can be obtained by adding the perturbation term to the smooth seasonal mean. To verify the accuracy of the proposed method, daily <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> data for the Wu-Tu watershed were analyzed. The analytical results demonstrate that wavelet denoising enhances the precision of daily <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> modeling of the seasonal model. In addition, the wavelet denoising technique proposed in this study can obtain the smooth seasonal mean of <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> processes and is suitable for modeling actual daily <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> processes...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in south-eastern Australia {{has been in}} the grip of a serious drought for many years. Over the period 1997 − 2006, mean annual rainfall has been approximately 16 percent lower than the long-term (1895 − 2006) average across the MDB. Runoff has been 39 percent lower over the same period. The continuing drought in the MDB has brought the need for a thorough understanding of how the current drought compares to the longer-term variability of <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> in the MDB. In this paper, we: (1) examine the historical variability of annual <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> in the MDB using a statistical “changedetection” methodology; (2) quantify, in a probabilistic sense, the severity of the recent dry sequence using average recurrence intervals (ARIs); and (3) quantify the hydroclimatic causes of low runoff in the southern MDB, using the Campaspe basin as a representative example, with the lumped conceptual daily rainfallrunoff model SIMHYD and four scenarios of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. In terms of annual <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> in the MDB, the largest signal is an increase in both <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> after the mid- 1940 s.

40|$|Studying the {{processes}} {{responsible for the}} distribution of water resources in a river basin over space and time is of great importance for spatial planning. In this study a multi-agent simulation approach is applied for exploring the influence of alternative reservoir operation strategies on water use distribution in the semi-arid Jaguaribe basin in case of decreasing rainfall. Water use distribution is analyzed both for one specific subbasin – our study area – and for the river basin level. Agents {{in this study are}} farmers that adapt to local variations in water availability. In this way both natural and human influences on water availability are taken into account. This study shows that a decrease in <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> in the Jaguaribe basin leads to a transition of water use from the dry season to the wet season. The dry season water use decreases because of reduced water availability in the dry season. This mainly is the result of reduced <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> in the wet season and the consequent increased water use for irrigation in the wet season. A decrease in <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> also leads to a relative transition of water use from downstream to upstream at the basin scale. Strategic reservoir operation enables local water managers to offset the effect of decreasing <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> with regards to water use at the subbasin level, at the cost of further decreasing water availability at the basin level...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} some {{properties of}} the <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> processes at the daily scale looking at their combination related to the flood generation mechanisms and we show how these relationships can improve the prediction of flood risk. In alpine regions, the effects on floods of snow accumulation and melting can be recognised by comparison of <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> peaks at a seasonal basis. Similarly, evaluation of the timing and magnitude of <b>rainfall</b> and <b>runoff</b> events can provide information about the homogeneity of flood regimes both at a site and within morphologically homogeneous regions. In this paper we evaluate the within-year distribution of daily precipitation and runoff considered as peaks over threshold (POT), which provides meaningful additional information to traditional annual maximum series finalised to flood frequency analysis (FFA). Application to some 30 time series in Piemonte (Italy) shows the characters of different regimes of flood generation (snow-ice dominated and/or rainfall dominated), where joint action of both the climatic dominant factors produce non-homogeneous flood processes.

The Pwalugu catchment in the White Volta Basin experiences one rainy season which usually begins from April and peaks up in July, August, and September and gradually end with some showers in October and part of November. The basis of the analysis comprises of the <b>rainfall</b> events and <b>runoff</b> of the White Volta River at Pwalugu, to determine the relationship between the <b>rainfall</b> events and <b>runoff</b> and also estimates the contribution of <b>rainfall</b> to <b>runoff</b> by a certain threshold of rainfall.

For the linear regression relationships of cumulated rainfall events and discharges for the various years considered for the study, it is realized that 2003 and 2009 recorded the highest coefficients of correlation of 0. 96 and 0. 92 respectively. The studies showed that the minimum rainfall that can cause runoff in the catchment is 25 mm which was set as a threshold.
