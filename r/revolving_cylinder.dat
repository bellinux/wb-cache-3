25|$|A {{revolver}} is a repeating handgun {{that has}} a <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> containing multiple chambers {{and at least one}} barrel for firing. Revolvers might be regarded as a subset of pistols, or as an equal-ranking subset of handguns, distinct from pistols, which in this case are defined as handguns with a single chamber.|$|E
25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|E
50|$|A {{mechanical}} musical instrument, automatically {{played by}} means of <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinders,</b> invented in 1851 by F. T. Kaufmann of Dresden. It comprises a complete wind orchestra, {{with the addition of}} kettle-drums, side drums, cymbals, tambourine and triangle.|$|R
5000|$|Robert A. Heinlein, in his 1963 {{novelisation}} Orphans of the Sky (compiling {{two stories}} published in 1941), introduced <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinders</b> to emulate gravity. In this case {{there were many}} concentric levels, at which gravity stepwise-decreased towards {{the centre of the}} structure, resulting in zero gravity at the very centre.|$|R
5000|$|Cobray also {{produced}} an odd revolver called the [...] "Pocket Pal" [...] that featured the same break-action, layout, and hammer {{system of the}} Brownie. Cobray combined this with a unique twin-barrel, dual-caliber system. Two [...] "zig-zag" [...] <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinders</b> were provided, one in [...]22 LR {{and the other in}} [...]380 ACP. The same hammer fired either the [...]22 caliber in the bottom barrel or the [...]380 in the top depending on which cylinder was installed.|$|R
2500|$|California defines {{assault weapons}} by name, by [...] "series" [...] (AK or AR-15), and by characteristic. [...] A shotgun with a <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> is also {{defined as an}} assault weapon.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a general}} rule, revolvers cannot be {{effective}} {{with a sound}} suppressor ("silencer"), as there is usually a small gap between the <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the barrel which a bullet must traverse or jump when fired. From this opening, a rather loud report is produced. [...] A suppressor can only suppress noise coming from the muzzle.|$|E
2500|$|The Colt Single Action Army, {{also known}} as the Single Action Army, SAA, Model P, Peacemaker, M1873, and Colt [...]45 is a single-action {{revolver}} with a <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> holding six metallic cartridges. It was designed for the U.S. government service revolver trials of 1872 by Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company— today's Colt's Manufacturing Company— and was adopted as the standard military service revolver until 1892.|$|E
2500|$|A single-action {{revolver}} {{requires the}} hammer {{to be pulled}} back by hand before each shot, which also <b>revolves</b> the <b>cylinder.</b> This leaves the trigger with just one [...] "single action" [...] left to perform - releasing the hammer to fire the shot - so the force and distance required {{to pull the trigger}} can be minimal. In contrast, with a self-cocking revolver, one long squeeze of the trigger pulls back the hammer and <b>revolves</b> the <b>cylinder,</b> then finally fires the shot. They can generally be fired faster than a single-action, but with reduced accuracy in the hands of most shooters.|$|R
25|$|The second way is double-action, {{or from a}} hammer-down position. In this case, {{the trigger}} first cocks the hammer and <b>revolves</b> the <b>cylinder,</b> then trips the hammer {{at the rear of}} the trigger stroke, firing the round in the chamber.|$|R
50|$|Maelzel {{was born}} in Regensburg. The son of an organ builder, he {{received}} a comprehensive musical education. He moved to Vienna in 1792.After several years of study and experiment, he produced an orchestrion instrument, which was publicly exhibited, and afterward sold for 3,000 florins. In 1804, he invented the panharmonicon, an automaton able to play the musical instruments of a military band, powered by bellows and directed by <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinders</b> storing the notes. This attracted universal attention; the inventor became noted throughout Europe, was appointed imperial court-mechanician at Vienna, and drew the admiration of Ludwig van Beethoven and other noted composers. This instrument was sold to a Parisian admirer for 120,000 francs.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} what today is called a revolver were made in Germany in the late 16th century. These weapons featured a single barrel with a <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> holding the powder and ball. They would soon be made by many European gun-makers, in numerous designs and configurations. However, these weapons were difficult to use, complicated and prohibitively expensive to make, and as such they were not widely distributed.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{the term}} [...] "revolver" [...] usually only refers to handguns, other {{firearms}} {{may also have}} a <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder.</b> These include some models of grenade launchers, shotguns, and rifles. [...] These are different from other firearms with revolving chambers, such as miniguns and gatling guns in that revolvers typically require the hammer to be re-cocked with each shot and require manual reloading, while miniguns are [...] semi-automatic or automatic and often belt-fed.|$|E
2500|$|A {{revolver}} {{can be kept}} {{loaded and}} ready to fire without fatiguing any springs and is not very dependent on lubrication for proper firing. Additionally, {{in the case of}} double-action-only revolvers there is no risk of accidental discharge from dropping alone, as the hammer is cocked by the trigger pull. [...] However, the revolver's clockwork-like internal parts are relatively delicate and can become misaligned after a severe impact, and its <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> can become jammed by excessive dirt or debris.|$|E
50|$|When the action-cylinder-barrel {{assembly}} moves back, {{either by}} hand-cocking or recoil, a pivoting lever {{connected to the}} frame cocks the hammer while a stud on the frame rides in the zig-zag grooves on the outer <b>cylinder,</b> <b>revolving</b> the next chamber part-way to ready position. When the internal spring brings the assembly forward the stud <b>revolves</b> the <b>cylinder</b> completely, and the chamber lines up with the barrel. Neither pulling the trigger nor manually cocking the hammer alone rotates the gun's cylinder; the entire assembly must be cocked to ensure that a chamber is properly lined up with the barrel.|$|R
50|$|About 9000 LT {{of night}} soil were {{collected}} in Rochdale each year, from {{a population of about}} 64,000—roughly 313 lb per person. At the depot, the night soil was emptied into a storage tank. The pails were washed in a large trough using a mixture of chloride of lime and water. The night soil was then dried in <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinders,</b> using furnace heat from other borough refuse, before being transferred to so-called drying plates. Gases were burnt in a furnace, the fumes escaping up a 250 ft chimney. Clinker from the remains of burnt refuse was used to make mortar. The manure works was a filthy environment, filled with dust. Enginemen were paid 7¼d, firemen 6½d, and general labourers 4½d. The fertiliser was transported from the works via railway to local filtration plots for disposal.|$|R
50|$|An {{automatic}} revolver (more correctly, a semi-automatic revolver) is {{a revolver}} {{that uses the}} energy of firing for cocking the hammer and <b>revolving</b> the <b>cylinder,</b> rather than using manual operations to perform these actions. Examples of genuine semi-automatic revolvers are rare, and the term is more often applied to break-open revolvers with automatic systems for ejecting spent casings on opening.|$|R
2500|$|Drawing {{from federal}} and state law definitions, the term assault weapon refers {{primarily}} to semi-automatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns {{that are able to}} accept detachable magazines and possess one or more other features. Some jurisdictions define <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> shotguns as assault weapons. Legislative definitions do not include fully automatic weapons, which are regulated separately as Title II weapons under federal law. A key defining law was the now-defunct Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994. [...] At that time, the United States Department of Justice said, [...] "In general, assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use." ...|$|E
2500|$|The First Model Ring Lever rifle {{features}} a [...] octagonal barrel with a browned finish. [...] The finishes {{of the other}} metal parts are blued. [...] The rifle {{features a}} circular trigger guard, which lies behind the ring lever. [...] The ring-shaped lever {{is used by the}} operator to both cock the internal hammer and rotate the cylinder (as opposed to cocking an external hammer on later single-action revolvers). [...] The First Model was offered in [...]34, [...]36, [...]38, [...]40, and [...]44 calibers with an eight-shot <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder,</b> though ten-shot examples were produced in very limited numbers. [...] The cylinder features a roll engraving depicting a deer hunted by a centaur and a group of horsemen. [...] The front and rear edges of the cylinder were originally square, though later improvements yielded a rounded rear cylinder edge. [...] These improvements also included the addition of a cutout in the recoil shield to enable capping the nipples without disassembly and the addition of a loading lever. [...] The rifle features a walnut stock with crescent buttplate and a raised cheekpiece featuring an inlaid image of four horse-heads. [...] The First Model is distinguished by the presence of a top strap located over the cylinder, a feature absent from nearly all successive Colt revolvers until the development of the Colt Single Action Army in 1873.|$|E
60|$|Physiologists who are {{familiar}} with the <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> covered with highly-glazed paper, which is smoked, and then used for the purpose of recording the delicate movements of a tracer, will have noticed the beauty of the impression sometimes left by a finger that had accidentally touched it. They are also well versed in the art of varnishing such impressions to preserve them in a durable form.|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1901, Bruce {{purchased}} a Norwegian whaler, , {{at a cost of}} £2,620 (approximately £ as of [...] ). During the following months, the ship was completely rebuilt as an Antarctic research vessel, with two laboratories, a darkroom, and extensive specialist equipment. Two huge <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinders,</b> each carrying [...] of cable, were fitted to the deck to enable deep-sea trawling for marine specimens. Other equipment was installed for making depth soundings, for the collection of sea water and sea-bottom samples, and for meteorological and magnetic observations. The hull was massively reinforced to withstand the pressures of Antarctic ice, and the ship was re-rigged as a barque with auxiliary engines. This work increased the cost of the ship to £16,700 (approximately £ as of [...] ), which was met by the Coats family who altogether donated £30,000 towards the total expedition costs of £36,000. Renamed Scotia, the ship was ready for her sea trials in August 1902.|$|R
40|$|We see {{the world}} as three-dimensional, but because the retinal image is flat, we must derive the third dimension, depth, from {{two-dimensional}} cues. Image movement provides {{one of the most}} potent cues for depth. For example, the shadow of a contorted wire appears flat when the wire is stationary, but rotating the wire causes motion in the shadow, which suddenly appears three-dimensional. The neural mechanism of this effect, known as 'structure-from-motion', has not been discovered. Here we study cortical area MT, a primate region that is involved in visual motion perception. Two rhesus monkeys were trained to fixate their gaze while viewing two-dimensional projections of transparent, <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinders.</b> These stimuli appear to be three-dimensional, but the surface order perceived (front as opposed to back) tends to reverse spontaneously. These reversals occur because the stimulus does not specify which surface is in front or at the back. Monkeys reported which surface order they perceived after viewing the stimulus. In many of the neurons tested, there was a reproducible change in activity that coincided with reversals of the perceived surface order, even though the stimulus remained identical. This suggests that area MT has a basic role in structure-from-motion perception...|$|R

60|$|The {{influence}} of the progress of electrical knowledge and invention upon that of investigation in other fields of science is highly remarkable. The combination of electrical with mechanical contrivances has produced instruments by which, not only may extremely small intervals of time be exactly measured, but the varying rapidity of movements, which take place in such intervals and appear to the ordinary sense instantaneous, is recorded. The duration of the winking of an eye is a proverbial expression for an instantaneous action; but, by {{the help of the}} <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the electrical marking-apparatus, it is possible to obtain a graphic record of such an action, in which, if it endures a second, that second shall be subdivided into a hundred, or a thousand, equal parts, and the state of the action at each hundredth, or thousandth, of a second exhibited. In fact, these instruments may be said to be time-microscopes. Such appliances have not only effected a revolution in physiology, by the power of analysing the phenomena of muscular and nervous activity which they have conferred, but they have furnished new methods of measuring the rate of movement of projectiles to the artillerist. Again, the microphone, which renders the minutest movements audible, and which enables a listener to hear the footfall of a fly, has equipped the sense of hearing with the means of entering almost as deeply into the penetralia of nature, as does the sense of sight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I agreed, [...] "it's a slant at all {{commissions}} and committees {{who think they}} can jump in and settle this spiritistic controversy {{in the course of}} half an hour. Bottazzi, like Lombroso and Richet, was aware that he had entered upon a long road. He knew that a tired or worried medium was helpless. He called the same circle together for the 20th, willing to try patiently for developments. All came but Lombardi, whose place was taken by M. Jona, an engineer. The second sitting was a wonder. Warned by his first experience, Bottazzi nailed or screwed every movable thing fast to the walls of the cabinet. He was resolute to force 'John,' the supposed 'guide,' to touch the electric button and press the ball of India-rubber that connected with a mercury manometer. He intended to teach the spirit hand to register its actions on a <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> of smoked tin. He wanted graven records, so that no wiseacre like Harris, here, could say: 'Oh, the thing never moved. You were all hypnotized!' In effect, he said: 'They tell us that a cold wind blows from the cabinet. I will put a self-registering thermometer in the cabinet and see. They say tables weighing forty pounds have been lifted. All I ask is that the bulb of a self-registering manometer be pressed. They say a Morse telegraphic key has been sounded by spirit hands. Very well; I will arrange a connection so that every pressure of the key will be registered on a sheet of smoked paper, so that the fact of the sound of the key shall be recorded by an infallible instrument.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The French {{coffee is}} reputed {{the best in}} the world; and a {{thousand}} voices have asked, What is it about the French coffee? In the first place, then, the French coffee is coffee, and not chicory, or rye, or beans, or peas. In the second place, it is freshly roasted, whenever made,--roasted with great care and evenness in a little <b>revolving</b> <b>cylinder</b> which makes part of the furniture of every kitchen, and which keeps in the aroma of the berry. It is never overdone, so as to destroy the coffee flavor, which is in nine cases out of ten the fault of the coffee we meet with. Then it is ground, and placed in a coffee-pot with a filter, through which it percolates in clear drops--the coffee-pot standing on a heated stove to maintain the temperature. The nose of the coffee-pot is stopped up to prevent the escape of the aroma during this process. The extract thus obtained is a perfectly clear, dark fluid, know as café noir, or black coffee. It is black only because of its strength, being in fact almost the very essential oil of coffee. A tablespoonful of this in boiled milk would make what is ordinarily called a strong cup of coffee. The boiled milk is prepared with no less care. It must be fresh and new, not merely warmed or even brought to the boiling point, but slowly simmered till it attains a thick, creamy richness. The coffee mixed with this, and sweetened with that sparkling beet-root sugar which ornaments a French table, is the celebrated café-au-lait, the name of which has gone round the world.|$|E
