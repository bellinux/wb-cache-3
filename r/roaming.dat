40|$|Mobile Safe Ambients (SA) was {{proposed}} {{in order to}} remove the grave interference in the Mobile Ambient calculus. But the coactions introduced in SA also bring some security breaches. In this paper, a similar calculus called Robust Ambients (<b>ROAM)</b> {{was proposed}} as a more rational substitute for SA. Through specifying {{the parameters of the}} coactions, the ambients in <b>ROAM</b> are more robust against malicious tampering. The encoding of polyadic asynchronous p-calculus in <b>ROAM</b> shows that <b>ROAM</b> does not loss the strong expressiveness of its ancestors. The type system for <b>ROAM</b> proposed here also shows that the new calculus has some very good properties...|$|R
50|$|Real-time optimally {{adapting}} mesh (<b>ROAM),</b> is {{a continuous}} {{level of detail}} algorithm that optimizes terrain meshes. On modern computers, sometimes it is more effective to send {{a small amount of}} unneeded polygons to the GPU, rather than burden the CPU with LOD (Level of Detail) calculations - making algorithms like geomipmapping more effective than <b>ROAM.</b> This technique is used by graphics programmersin order to produce high quality displays while being able to maintain real-time frame rates. Algorithms such as <b>ROAM</b> exist to provide a control over scene quality versus performance in order to provide HQ scenes while retaining real-time frame rates on hardware. <b>ROAM</b> largely aims toward terrain visualization, but various elements from <b>ROAM</b> are difficult to place within a game system.|$|R

This includes the requirement to sign a special insurance policy to cover any search and rescue costs the Governor would incur, should it be necessary.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to initial}} reports of monogamy, ruffed lemurs {{in the wild}} exhibit {{seasonal}} polygamous breeding behavior, with {{both males and females}} mating with more than one partner within a single season.

Females mate primarily with males with whom they had affiliative relations prior to mating season, although some matings occurred with <b>roaming</b> males from other communities.|$|E
5|$|Paul Wasansky, who in 1570 was {{executed}} in Ivančice, in present-day Czech Republic, {{on account of}} 124 confessed murders (he was a <b>roaming</b> highwayman), underwent a particularly gruelling execution procedure: First, his limbs were cut off and his nipples were ripped off with glowing pincers. He was then flayed, afterwards impaled and finally roasted alive. The pamphlet, which purports to give Wasansky's verbatim confession, does not record how Wasansky was apprehended, nor what means of torture was used to extract his confessions.|$|E

Texts {{such as the}} Mahabharata, the Linga Purana, and the Kanchipuranam blame Vishwamitra for provoking Kalmashapada to slay Vashishtha's sons.

The game world is populated by <b>roaming</b> enemies: three dragons that can eat the avatar and a bat that randomly steals and hides items around the game world.

5|$|Final Fantasy XI is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG), and {{differs from}} previous {{titles in the}} series in several ways. Unlike the predefined main characters of previous Final Fantasy titles, players are able to customize their characters in limited ways, including selecting from one of five races and choosing their gender, facial style, hair color, body size, job, and nation allegiance. Also diverging from previous games in the series, the game {{takes place in a}} fully three-dimensional landscape with enemies freely <b>roaming</b> in it, allowing battles to occur in real time as opposed to the random encounters used in previous games - a trend continued in every numbered Final Fantasy title since.|$|E

After the bombs fail to explode as planned, Harris and Klebold decide to enter the school and murder as many people as they can; the final number killed is up to the player. After <b>roaming</b> around the school shooting innocents, Harris and Klebold commit suicide.

Later reports of <b>roaming</b> individuals being seen or caught are unconfirmed. A record of one great auk in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of a member of the species. The great auk is mentioned in several novels and the scientific journal of the American Ornithologists' Union is named The Auk in honour of this bird.|$|E
