5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with a cosmic ray. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby <b>reactant</b> by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the changes to the ride in 1990, the special effects began to {{deteriorate}} {{due to a lack}} of upkeep. By the time the ride closed, many of the effects were no longer active or had been covered up. Blacklight <b>reactant</b> paint lined the walls, mostly in the form of handprints or outlines of scenes. These gave a 3-D appearance when the rider wore special glasses purchased at the beginning of the queue.|$|E
50|$|The {{quality of}} {{stereospecificity}} {{is focused on}} the <b>reactants</b> and their stereochemistry; it is concerned with the products too, but only as they provide evidence of a difference in behavior between <b>reactants.</b> Of stereoisomeric <b>reactants,</b> each behaves in its own specific way.|$|R

The proton is released into solution, while the reductant RH is oxidized and NAD reduced to NADH by transfer of the hydride to the nicotinamide ring.|$|E
5|$|Molten salts will solidify on cooling {{to below}} their {{freezing}} point. This is sometimes {{used for the}} solid-state synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants, which are first melted together. In other cases, the solid reactants {{do not need to}} be melted, but instead can react through a solid-state reaction route. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the <b>reactant</b> mixture remains in the oven. Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E
25|$|The {{experimental}} determination of reaction rates involves measuring how {{the concentrations of}} reactants or products change over time.

50|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{concentrations of}} the products and <b>reactants</b> do not directly depend on the total pressure of the system.

25|$|The {{standard}} potential of an electrochemical cell requires standard conditions (ΔG°) {{for all of}} the reactants.

25|$|The {{simplest}} inorganic {{reaction is}} double displacement when in mixing of two salts the ions are swapped without {{a change in}} oxidation state. In redox reactions one <b>reactant,</b> the oxidant, lowers its oxidation state and another <b>reactant,</b> the reductant, has its oxidation state increased. The net result is an exchange of electrons. Electron exchange can occur indirectly as well, e.g., in batteries, a key concept in electrochemistry.|$|E
40|$|Equilibrium {{calculations}} on biochemical reaction {{systems can}} be made at three levels. Level 1 is the usual chemical calculation with species at specified temperature and pressure using standard Gibbs energies of formation of species or equilibrium constants K. Level 2 utilizes <b>reactants</b> such as ATP (a sum of species) at specified T, P, pH, and pMg with standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation of <b>reactants</b> or apparent equilibrium constants K'. Calculations at this level can also {{be made on the}} enzymatic mechanism for a biochemical reaction. Level 3 utilizes <b>reactants</b> at specified T, P, pH, and pMg, but the equilibrium concentrations of certain <b>reactants</b> are also specified. The fundamental equation of thermodynamics is derived here for Level 3. Equilibrium calculations at this level use standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation of <b>reactants</b> at specified concentrations of certain <b>reactants</b> or apparent equilibrium constants K". Level 3 is useful in calculating equilibrium concentrations of <b>reactants</b> that can be reached in a living cell when some of the <b>reactants</b> are available at steady-state concentrations. Calculations at all three levels are facilitated by the use of conservation matrices and stoichiometric number matrices for systems.

40|$|A novel type of {{membrane}} reactor with separated feeding of the <b>reactants</b> is presented for chemical processes normally requiring strict stoichiometric feed rates of premixed <b>reactants.</b> The <b>reactants</b> are fed in the reactor {{to the different}} sides of a porous membrane which is impregnated with a catalyst for a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction. If the reaction rate is fast compared to the diffusion rates of the <b>reactants,</b> a small reaction zone inside the membrane occurs and slip {{of one of the}} <b>reactants</b> to the opposing side of the membrane is prevented. The location of this reaction zone will be such that the molar fluxes of the <b>reactants</b> are always in stoichiometric ratio. The features of this reactor are shown by means of mathematical modelling of molecular diffusion and viscous flow combined with an instantaneous, reversible reaction inside the membrane. As a model reaction the Claus reaction was selected and by conversion measurements the principle of a shifting reaction plane inside a porous membrane is demonstrated. ...|$|R

25|$|In case (a), {{which is}} an {{exothermic}} reaction, {{the energy of the}} transition state is closer in energy to that of the <b>reactant</b> than that of the intermediate or the product. Therefore, from the postulate, the structure of the transition state also more closely resembles that of the <b>reactant.</b> In case (b), the energy of the transition state is close to neither the <b>reactant</b> nor the product, making none of them a good structural model for the transition state. Further information would be needed in order to predict the structure or characteristics of the transition state. Case (c) depicts the potential diagram for an endothermic reaction, in which, according to the postulate, the transition state should more closely resemble that of the intermediate or the product.|$|E
25|$|The rate of a {{reaction}} is always positive. A negative sign is present {{to indicate that}} the <b>reactant</b> concentration is decreasing.) The IUPAC recommends that the unit of time should always be the second. The rate of reaction differs from the rate of increase of concentration of a product P by a constant factor (the reciprocal of its stoichiometric number) and for a <b>reactant</b> A by minus the reciprocal of the stoichiometric number. The stoichiometric numbers are included so that the defined rate is independent of which <b>reactant</b> or product species is chosen for measurement. For example, if a = 1 and b = 3 then B is consumed three times more rapidly than A, but v = -d/dt = -(1/3)d/dt is uniquely defined.|$|E
25|$|Concentration: Reaction rate {{increases}} with concentration, {{as described by}} the rate law and explained by collision theory. As <b>reactant</b> concentration increases, the frequency of collision increases.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn our {{previous}} studies of a plasma reformer system, the effects of temperature of the <b>reactants</b> and input voltage have not been considered. In the present investigation, the plasma reformer system has been modified to study {{the influence of the}} reactants’ temperature and input voltage on hydrogen production experimentally. The plasma reformer system includes a supersonic atomizer, a plasma generator, and a controlling device. In the experiment, the operating parameters include the temperature of the <b>reactants</b> and the input voltage. The temperature of the <b>reactants</b> varies from 25 °C to 50 °C, and the input voltage ranges from 12. 5 V to 14. 5 V. Results show that the increase in temperature of the <b>reactants</b> and input voltage will improve the production of hydrogen. In addition, the improvement of heating on the <b>reactants</b> shows significant influence on hydrogen production...|$|R
5000|$|Using Hammond's postulate, {{the lower}} {{energy of the}} {{tertiary}} transition state means that its structure is relatively closer to its <b>reactants</b> R(tertiary)-X than to the carbocation [...] "product" [...] {{when compared to the}} secondary case. Thus, the tertiary transition state will be more geometrically similar to the R(tertiary)-X <b>reactants</b> than the secondary transition state is to its R(secondary)-X <b>reactants.</b> Hence, if the tertiary transition state is close in structure to the (low energy) <b>reactants,</b> then it will also be lower in energy because structure determines energy. Likewise, if the secondary transition state is more similar to the (high energy) carbocation [...] "product," [...] then it will be higher in energy.|$|R
50|$|In the {{formalism}} of transition-state theory {{the reaction}} coordinate is that coordinate in set of curvilinear coordinates {{obtained from the}} conventional ones for the <b>reactants</b> which, for each reaction step, leads smoothly from {{the configuration of the}} <b>reactants</b> through that of the transition state to the configuration of the products. The reaction coordinate is typically chosen to follow the path along the gradient (path of shallowest ascent/deepest descent) of potential energy from <b>reactants</b> to products.|$|R
25|$|Another unique {{aspect of}} the - {{reaction}} {{is that there is}} only one <b>reactant,</b> which must be taken into account when calculating the reaction rate.|$|E

25|$|For {{elementary}} reactions or reaction steps, {{the order}} and stoichiometric coefficient are both equal to the molecularity or number of molecules participating. For a unimolecular reaction or step the rate {{is proportional to the}} concentration of molecules of <b>reactant,</b> so that the rate law is first order. For a bimolecular reaction or step, the number of collisions is proportional to the product of the two <b>reactant</b> concentrations, or second order. A termolecular step is predicted to be third order, but also very slow as simultaneous collisions of three molecules are rare.|$|E
5000|$|In this manner, all {{chemical}} species, {{including the}} free <b>reactants,</b> are {{treated in the}} same way, having been formed from the combination of <b>reactants</b> that is specified by the stoichiometric coefficients. The mass-balance equations assume the simpler form.|$|R
30|$|In the {{reaction}} system, {{there are only}} three kinds of <b>reactants,</b> AgNO 3, Tween 80, and traces of water without additional reductants. Thus, it is convenient to evaluate the effect of the concentrations of the <b>reactants</b> on the products.|$|R
2500|$|Therefore, the {{geometric}} {{structure of a}} state can be predicted by comparing its energy to the species neighboring it along the reaction coordinate. [...] For example, in an exothermic reaction the transition state is closer in energy to the <b>reactants</b> than to the products. [...] Therefore, the transition state will be more geometrically similar to the <b>reactants</b> than to the products. [...] In contrast, however, in an endothermic reaction the transition state is closer in energy to the products than to the <b>reactants.</b> [...] So, according to Hammond’s postulate {{the structure of the}} transition state would resemble the products more than the <b>reactants.</b> [...] This type of comparison is especially useful because most transition states cannot be characterized experimentally.|$|R
