5|$|Scientific {{instrument}} packages {{were installed}} on the lunar surface during all the Apollo landings. Long-lived instrument stations, including heat flow probes, seismometers, and magnetometers, were installed at the Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 landing sites. Direct transmission of data to Earth concluded in late 1977 due to budgetary considerations, but as the stations' lunar laser ranging corner-cube <b>retroreflector</b> arrays are passive instruments, they are still being used. Ranging to the stations is routinely performed from Earth-based stations with an accuracy of a few centimetres, and data from this experiment {{are being used to}} place constraints {{on the size of the}} lunar core.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} 21½ total {{hours on the}} lunar surface, they had left behind {{scientific}} instruments that included a <b>retroreflector</b> array used for the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure moonquakes. They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of {{the leadership of the}} US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management. (In his 1989 book, Men from Earth, Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating Cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin.) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book Moonshot, Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of retroreflectors (mirrors used as targets for Earth-based tracking lasers) from the Laser Ranging <b>Retroreflector</b> Experiment (LRRR) {{is evidence that}} there were landings. Lick Observatory attempted to detect from Apollo 11's <b>retroreflector</b> while Armstrong and Aldrin {{were still on the}} Moon but did not succeed until August 1, 1969. The Apollo 14 astronauts deployed a <b>retroreflector</b> on February 5, 1971, and McDonald Observatory detected it the same day. The Apollo 15 <b>retroreflector</b> was deployed on July 31, 1971, and was detected by McDonald Observatory within a few days. Smaller retroreflectors were also put on the Moon by the Russians; they were attached to the unmanned lunar rovers Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2.|$|E

50|$|Several sets of <b>retroreflectors</b> were {{installed}} on Earth's moon {{as part of}} the American Apollo and Soviet Lunokhod space programs. These <b>retroreflectors</b> are also ranged on a regular basis (lunar laser ranging), providing a highly accurate measurement of the dynamics of the Earth/Moon system.|$|R
25|$|The rover's payload {{included}} cameras (two TV {{and four}} panoramic telephotometers), a RIFMA X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, an RT-1 X-ray telescope, a PrOP odometer/penetrometer, a RV-2N radiation detector, and a TL laser <b>retroreflector.</b>|$|E
25|$|The railway {{project had}} failed, but a toll bridge in New Jersey {{requested}} a similar {{system so that}} it could quickly scan for cars that had purchased a monthly pass. Then the U.S. Post Office requested a system to track trucks entering and leaving their facilities. These applications required special <b>retroreflector</b> labels. Finally, Kal Kan asked the Sylvania team for a simpler (and cheaper) version which they could put on cases of pet food for inventory control.|$|E
500|$|They {{deployed}} the EASEP, {{which included}} a passive seismograph and a Lunar Ranging <b>Retroreflector</b> (LRRR). Then Armstrong walked [...] from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater [...] while Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes – {{the only time the}} hammer was used on Apollo 11. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|... "Retroreflectors" [...] (also [...] "reflex reflectors") produce {{no light}} of their own, but rather reflect {{incident}} light back towards its source, for example, another driver's headlight. They are regulated as automotive lighting devices, and specified {{to account for the}} separation between a vehicle's headlamps and its driver's eyes. Thus, vehicles are conspicuous even when their lights are off. Regulations worldwide require each vehicle to be equipped with rear-facing red <b>retroreflectors.</b> Since 1968 US regulations also require side-facing <b>retroreflectors,</b> amber in front and red in the rear. Sweden, South Africa and other countries have at various times required white front-facing <b>retroreflectors.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Until 2010, {{the final}} {{location}} of Lunokhod 1 was uncertain {{by a few}} kilometers. Lunar laser ranging experiments had failed to detect a return signal from its <b>retroreflector</b> since the 1970s. [...] On March 17, 2010, Albert Abdrakhimov found both the lander and the rover in Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter image M114185541RC. On April 22, Tom Murphy (UCSD) and Russet McMillan at the Apache Point Observatory detected the robot's <b>retroreflector</b> using the Apache Point telescopic pulsed-laser rangefinder.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{until the}} 1997 Mars Pathfinder was another {{remote-controlled}} vehicle {{put on an}} extraterrestrial body. [...] In 2010, nearly forty years after the 1971 loss of signal from Lunokhod 1, the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter photographed its tracks and final location, and researchers, using a telescopic pulsed-laser rangefinder, detected the robot's <b>retroreflector.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{artificial}} satellites carry <b>retroreflectors</b> so {{they can}} be tracked from ground stations. Some satellites were built solely for laser ranging.Other satellites include <b>retroreflectors</b> for orbit calibration, such as in satellite navigation (e.g., most GLONASS satellites and a few GPS satellites) as well as in satellite altimetry (e.g., TOPEX/Poseidon).Retroreflectors can also be used for inter-satellite laser ranging (e.g., GRACE-FO).|$|R
40|$|The {{scientific}} objectives achievable through high-accuracy range measurements to lunar <b>retroreflectors</b> are considered. A specific {{study of}} design {{questions related to}} the operation of <b>retroreflectors</b> on the lunar surface indicated that a reflector panel containing a number of solid fused silica corner reflectors {{would be capable of}} maintaining essentially diffraction limited performance under direct solar illumination. Initial Apollo 11 observations are discussed together with the installation of additional lunar <b>retroreflectors</b> in connection with the Luna 17, Apollo 14, Apollo 15, and Luna 21 missions. Range measurements at the McDonald Observatory are considered along with new results from lunar range data, and prospects regarding future lunar ranging stations...|$|R

50|$|Inexpensive corner-aiming retroreflectors {{are used}} in {{user-controlled}} technology as optical datalink devices. Aiming is done at night, and the necessary <b>retroreflector</b> area depends on aiming distance and ambient lighting from street lamps. The optical receiver itself behaves as a weak <b>retroreflector</b> because it contains a large, precisely focused lens that detects illuminated objects in its focal plane. This allows aiming without a <b>retroreflector</b> for short ranges.|$|E
