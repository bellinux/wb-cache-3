5|$|Every {{window in}} the church {{contains}} coloured glass (except the two tiny windows in the chapel of St Padarn). The windows are mostly narrow single lancets, and {{at the ends of}} the transepts and at the west end are arranged one and two. Some are possibly mediaeval, in the same eroded yellow stone as the quoins. The west and south gables have three windows, spaced two below and one above. The north has two only window. There are four lancets to the nave on the north, with three and the porch to the south. The transepts also have single lancet windows east and west. The north transept has a nineteenth century two-light east window with the <b>relieving</b> <b>arch</b> of an older window well above.|$|E
25|$|In April 1889, Pearson's {{plans for}} the cathedral were {{approved}} for the original site bounded by George, Elizabeth and William Streets.It was a cruciform church with a wide nave, double aisles, apse and ambulatory, short transepts about halfway {{along the length of}} the building and an apsidal side chapel on the north. The west front had towers close to the end of the nave. The upper part of the west wall was supported by a <b>relieving</b> <b>arch,</b> which continued the line of the interior cross arches. The towers had massive buttresses. Their strong vertical lines carried on into corner turrets set before pyramidal spires.|$|E
500|$|Skilbeck's Warehouse, {{formerly}} at 46 Upper Thames Street, London, and now demolished, was a drysalter's warehouse {{constructed by}} Burges in 1866 and is important as his only foray into industrial design. Burges {{was commissioned by}} the Skilbeck Brothers to re-model an existing warehouse; the result was influential, Eastlake describing it as, [...] "one {{of the very few}} instances of the successful adaptation of Gothic for commercial purposes." [...] Bradley writes of Burges's re-modelling as using [...] "twin pointed bays under a single Gothic <b>relieving</b> <b>arch</b> and gable". The use of exposed cast iron was revolutionary. Modern materials and technologies were combined with gothic iconography, an article of 1886 in The Ecclesiologist describing [...] "the great crane supported by a corbel carved into a bust of a fair Oriental maid, symbolising the clime from which so much of the drysalter's materials are brought, and over a circular window in the gable (a) ship bringing in its precious freight." [...] The total cost of the work was £1,413.|$|E
25|$|The top of {{the rotunda}} wall {{features}} a series of brick <b>relieving</b> <b>arches,</b> visible {{on the outside and}} built into the mass of the brickwork. The Pantheon is full of such devices– for example, there are <b>relieving</b> <b>arches</b> over the recesses inside– but all these arches were hidden by marble facing on the interior and possibly by stone revetment or stucco on the exterior.|$|R

50|$|A {{remote and}} austere building, Kirkhope Tower is of a square {{footprint}} and constructed from local stone. It {{consists of four}} main floors and a garret floor above the parapet. Its small windows are constructed with simple <b>relieving</b> <b>arches</b> and stand {{with the exception of}} the light into the Ground floor at heights of over thirty feet. It stands on rough ground that slopes steeply away to the valley below.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{access to}} the flats from iron {{balconies}} is typical of this phase. Serious five-story blocks in red brick and glazed terracotta, enlivened with Arts and Crafts details, e.g. the parapet curving up over the octagonal end bays and the pointed <b>relieving</b> <b>arches</b> over the windows filled with herringbone brick, as favoured {{at the same time}} by Holden at the Belgrave Hospital. Playful but vandal-proof steel gates throughout by Hutchinson and Partners." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “Stylistically, the Row {{combines}} Greek Revival and Eastlake motifs into {{an overall}} symmetrical framework (Carter p. 1).” Silver Row Apartments consist of five single story brick apartment units {{set out in}} a line. The apartments share a gabled roof and common walls. The entire structure measures about 120 feet in length. The central door has a window on either side. The long windows are topped by <b>relieving</b> <b>arches</b> with decorative infill, similar to the decor over the doors. Decorative wood, arches, pendents, and other Victorian detailing distinguish this apartment’s historical significance from others.|$|R
50|$|The {{northeast}} elevation has {{a central}} projecting gable, and an enclosed verandah {{to the ground}} floor. The gable has a central louvred window, surmounted by a sandstone <b>relieving</b> <b>arch,</b> with a stepped sandstone moulding below. The enclosed verandah has a corrugated iron lean-to roof, fibrous cement cladding, and louvred and casement windows.|$|E
50|$|The eastern jamb on the {{original}} gate of Nur ad-Din Zangi is still visible, while the western one has been absorbed by the surrounding shops. The jamb is decorated {{with a combination of}} Aleppan-styled moldings and engravings of three-leaves without stems. The later additions of al-Malik al-Salih included a monolithic column re-used as a lintel, and the four corbels above the <b>relieving</b> <b>arch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The site {{is shown}} on John Speed's map of 'Dubline' (1610)(number 11), has been {{partially}} excavated, and is {{listed on the}} National Monuments Service database, Those excavations revealed; c. 70 burials of late 12th -14th century (1993), surviving remains of the friary on the E side of Cecilia House (1995 (test excavations)) and, in 1996 excavations exposed a section of wall with a <b>relieving</b> <b>arch</b> and a corner tower.|$|E
50|$|The {{first floor}} is concrete. On the upper two stories, 14 by 8 in timber joists rest across the steel beams, {{supporting}} wood planking several inches thick. This {{is covered by}} steel plate in many areas to make moving barrels around easier. The firewalls have two entries with <b>relieving</b> <b>arches</b> and iron sliding doors on tracks. The elevator in the southwest corner is the original traction elevator, with its motor on top to free up space on the first floor. Most partitions within the firewalled areas are made of materials that can easily be removed without seriously damaging the building.|$|R
50|$|There are {{not much}} {{structural}} alteration to the building. The pitched roof is finished with double layer Chinese clay tiles, with a single chimney stack and flue openings projects above the ridge. The windows of the building consist of wooden casements incorporated in window openings with granite cills and lintels. Above the lintels, there are rough brick <b>relieving</b> <b>arches.</b> Ornamental ironwork balustrades with granite copings is retained from an arched verandah, which is now enclosed with windows. Doors of the building which are cross braced and battened, are also made of wood. Cast-iron rainwater pipes, hopper heads and gutters along {{the wall of the}} building also have executional level of significance to the building.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} built of red brick with a tile roof. It has four gables facing the street, {{alternately}} shaped and stepped, and features three storeys. The {{sections of the}} house frontage differ. The left section has six double-hung, flush windows with glazing bars, flat brick arches and small brick cornice mouldings. The right section windows have cambered brick <b>relieving</b> <b>arches.</b> The ground floor has an entrance door with wooden architrave and hood on carved brackets. The gables have brick copings and the ground and first floor have brick bands. The interior is reported to feature a semi-circular recess with fluted pilasters and moulded cornice and newel staircase in oak. The exterior is partially covered with wisteria vine.|$|R
50|$|The {{northwest}} elevation has a gable end to {{the main}} wing, with two courses of sandstone forming a base, and a large louvred window to the ground floor surmounted by a sandstone <b>relieving</b> <b>arch.</b> The first floor has a smaller casement window surmounting a stepped sandstone moulding. A small square window opening, with glass louvres lighting a non-original toilet, has been inserted {{to the south of}} the casement window. External plumbing is also visible.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} types of shot-holes, providing {{a wide range of}} fire-angles. [...] In the front elevation there is an enlarged 1st floor window under <b>relieving</b> <b>arch</b> which lights the first floor hall. A similar window in the south gable has been blocked. There is a second floor window in the front elevation, while other windows are very small and are randomly sited. The monogram of Thomas Menzies of Durn is carved on the south west turret.|$|E
50|$|Today, the {{structure}} is surrounded by thick vegetation, and serves only to carry a wood shed. The bridge has a span of 6 m, a width of 3.3 m and is built of travertine. The walls of one ramp feature two flood arches, one of which has a segmental shape and runs from the ground to the quarter point of the main arch rib. A similar segmental <b>relieving</b> <b>arch</b> {{can be found at}} another Roman bridge in central Italy, the Ponte di Pioraco.|$|E
50|$|The piers {{supporting}} the arches have become quite worn over time. They show several interesting architectural techniques. The bossage technique is {{visible on the}} downstream side of the eastern piers. The upstream faces of the piers show stepped cutwaters and footings. These stepped piers are a feature typical of Roman construction. Two of the <b>relieving</b> <b>arches</b> (the fifth and seventh arches from the western end) have their upstream side open but have been filled on the downstream side. The dimensions of the arches all differ due to the complex histpry of its construction. The upstream faces of the piers now have triangular cutwaters. These were all rebuilt {{during one of the}} Ottoman restorations, which accounts for their uniform appearance today.|$|R
50|$|The two-storey {{building}} {{was laid out}} as a cross passage house with a solar wing. The house is constructed of rubble stone with stone tile roofs. The chimney stacks are of ashlar masonry with moulded caps. The building has a U-plan with a cross passage hall, and consists of two storeys with attics above. The front has two, four and one bay respectively, with the projecting wings gabled. The large windows have stone mullions and <b>relieving</b> <b>arches.</b> The doorway is {{to the left of}} the central section and has double doors with a moulded stone surround. There is a single storey extension with a flat roof to the left, added in the nineteenth century. The parapet has coping between the gables.|$|R
500|$|The Pantheon in Rome, {{completed}} by Emperor Hadrian {{as part of}} the Baths of Agrippa, has the most famous, best preserved, and largest Roman dome. Its diameter was more than twice as wide as any known earlier dome. Dating from the 2nd century, it is an unreinforced concrete dome [...] wide resting on a circular wall, or rotunda, [...] thick. This rotunda, made of brick-faced concrete, contains a large number of <b>relieving</b> <b>arches</b> and is not solid. Seven interior niches and the entrance way divide the wall structurally into eight virtually independent piers. These openings and additional voids account for a quarter of the rotunda wall's volume. The only opening in the dome is the brick-lined oculus at the top, [...] in diameter, that provides light and ventilation for the interior.|$|R
50|$|The narrow {{limestone}} {{bridge over}} the River Chew is possibly 13th or 14th-century in origin with more recent repairs. The bridge spans about 12 metres, about 5 metres across footway, parapet wall to each side, about one metre high. Each side has two pointed arches with chamfered mouldings and <b>relieving</b> <b>arch,</b> central cutwater with off-sets to each side and pyramidal stone top, inner ribs to vaults; on east side, oval plaque with illegible inscription and strengthening with exposed steel girder. Ancient Monument Avon no. 162. The bridge was damaged in the Great Flood of 1968.|$|E
5000|$|The Camara Santa, as {{its ancient}} parts show, {{consists}} of a square easternsanctuary, attached to a rectangular cella [...] The sanctuary has a low barrel vault. Its frontal arch is carried by two marble columns of Roman origin. A pair of similar columns decorate the east window, which internally has an arch, but externally a square head with a rude brick <b>relieving</b> <b>arch,</b> just like the east window of the crypt below. Their capitals have a Corinthian style, with leaves packed into shells, relief being produced by the drill, and recall an angle capital in San Julián de los Prados.|$|E
50|$|Built in the double-gable H-plan style, {{this home}} is very {{representative}} of the average home in this area during {{the period in which}} it was built. There are several windows on the front facade of the house. The two windows closest to the small porch in the front are relatively simple and slim, while the two double-hung sash windows on the front facade have a more elegant appearance and are each enhanced by a <b>relieving</b> <b>arch</b> hovering over them, complete with raised extrados. The front door used to be aligned under the porch, but has subsequently been bricked in. The west wall is adjacent to a gable.|$|E
50|$|The {{elevated}} basement is almost completely above ground and has windows that are directly under {{those of the}} main floor above. The basement walls range in thickness from 1 to 3 feet and are constructed of rough fieldstones {{believed to have been}} excavated from the nearby fields. The basement windows are double hung-wooden sash with six-over-six panes. The water table which starts the brick construction contains <b>relieving</b> <b>arches</b> above the window openings. The water table is laid in English bond and separates the stone foundation below and the brick work of the first level above. It is unclear whether the water table is original or a later addition, but it is entirely mortared together with Portland cement, and not historically accurate lime based putty that is found in the brickwork above. Buttresses were added to the northeastern side in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Although {{a variety}} of {{materials}} have been used throughout the many periods of construction and restoration, the bridge was generally built of tufa, marble and spolia. The eastern section of the bridge in particular bears many marks of the original construction. The bridge was constructed using the wall-filling technique.The current length of the bridge is 310 m. The Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi recorded a length of 550 ft {{at the time of}} his visit. The bridge has 21 arches: 15 primary arches to carry the deck across the river and six small <b>relieving</b> <b>arches</b> within the larger piers. The bridge was shortened as portions of the approach at either end were buried during work to stabilize the river banks. The roadway is paved with cobblestones and is 11.4 m wide, including the sidewalks. The bridge's sculptural decoration includes a lion relief on the north side of the 11th arch, and various star-and-crescent artwork.|$|R
50|$|Frederick E. and Albina Bodell House 1928, 25 Balton Road, Providence RI: William T. Aldrich Boston, architect. A {{handsome}} dwelling {{designed in}} the manner of an 18th-century English manor house, set on a large lot partly surrounded by a brick wall. Constructed of hollow tile with Flemish-bond brick veneer, it has a two-and-a-half-story, hip-roofed main block with a one-and-a-half-story, hip-roofed, L-plan service and garage wing extending from one side. The house has a garden front on the south and an entrance front on the north. The seven-bay garden front has a central segmental-arch-pediment door surmounted by a stone bay with a shallow relief caning of a shouldered architrave around the window. The entrance front, overlooking a motor court framed by the main block and the service wing, has a three-bay, end-gabled entrance pavilion with a doorway-framed by pilasters and a pediment. There are segmental <b>relieving</b> <b>arches</b> over the windows and segmental-arch roof dormers. This is one of the grandest and most costly houses erected in Providence in the 1920s. Bodell was a partner in Bodell & Company, a banking and brokerage firm.|$|R

50|$|Andrew Petersen, an {{archaeologist}} specializing in Islamic architecture visited Khulda in 1993, and {{notes that the}} remains of at least four stone buildings can be seen, although only {{two of them are}} standing. The first of these is a rectangular structure (12 m x 6.5 m) with two separate rooms, each with its own entrance. Each door is flanked with two large windows. Both doors and windows are covered with lintels, above which is a <b>relieving</b> <b>arch.</b> An inscription above one of the doors have been removed. The roof is made with iron girders, with reinforced concrete, while the walls are dressed limestone. According to Petersen, the building must have served some public purpose, and it probably dates from the final years of the Ottoman rule, or the early British Mandate of Palestine period.|$|E
5000|$|Prysten House is a Grade I listed 15th-century merchant's house {{situated}} {{in the city of}} Plymouth in England. It is a large merchant's U-shaped three storey split level house built c.1498, extended 1635, built for Thomas Yogge who died in 1509 (Pevsner) with later truncation and restoration. It is constructed from Plymouth limestone rubble using <b>relieving</b> <b>arches</b> with Dartmoor granite hooded and ogee-framed Tudor dressings to glazed window openings, dry Devon slate roofs and two original lateral chimney stacks. The front has a distinctive and fine granite transomed bay window arrangement over a decorated and hooded doorway. The building is owned by Plymouth City Council and {{has been used as a}} museum and a restaurant, but contrary to the misnomer has never been a priest's house, its name originating simply from its close proximity to St Andrew's Church, Plymouth.Prysten House is home to the Plymouth Tapestry designed by Eric Mor and displays a model of Plymouth in 1620.

5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a <b>relieving</b> blind <b>arch</b> that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|R
