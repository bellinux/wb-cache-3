Our Keldysh-Green function based quantum transport simulations show that the spin ratchet mechanism is robust and prevails for disordered, though non-diffusive, mesoscopic structures. Extending the two-channel to the multi-channel case does not increase the net ratchet spin current efficiency but, remarkably, yields a dc spin transmission increasing linearly with channel number.

In a tailored parameter set for which the deterministic counterpart is in a non-chaotic regime, subdiffusion is a long-living transient whose lifetime can be many, many orders of magnitude larger than characteristic time scales of the setup thus being amenable to experimental observations. As a reason for this subdiffusive behaviour in the coordinate space we identify thermal noise induced dynamical localization in the velocity (momentum) space. This novel idea is distinct from existing knowledge {{and has never been}} reported for any classical or quantum systems. It suggests reconsideration of generally accepted opinion that subdiffusion is due to road distributions or strong correlations which reflect disorder, trapping, viscoelasticity of the medium or geometrical constraints.

40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} organelle (plastid) originated via primary endosymbiosis {{in which}} a phagotrophic protist captured and harnessed a cyanobacterium. The plastid was inherited by the common ancestor of the red, green (including land plants), and glaucophyte algae (together, the Plantae). Despite the critical importance of primary plastid endosymbiosis, its ancient derivation has left behind very few "footprints" of early key events in organelle genesis. To gain insights into this process, we conducted an in-depth phylogenomic analysis of genomic data (nuclear proteins) from 17 Plantae species to identify genes of a surprising provenance in these taxa, Chlamydiae bacteria. Previous studies show that Chlamydiae contributed many genes (at least 21 in one study) to Plantae that primarily have plastid functions and were postulated to have played {{a fundamental role in}} organelle evolution. Using our comprehensive approach, we identify at least 55 Chlamydiae-derived genes in algae and plants, of which 67 % (37 / 55) are putatively plastid targeted and at least 3 have mitochondrial functions. The remainder of the proteins does not contain a bioinformatically predicted organelle import signal although one has an N-terminal extension in comparison to the Chlamydiae homolog. Our data suggest that environmental Chlamydiae were significant contributors to early Plantae genomes that extend beyond plastid metabolism. The chlamydial gene distribution and protein tree topologies provide evidence for both endosymbiotic gene transfer and a horizontal gene transfer <b>ratchet</b> <b>driven</b> by recurrent endoparasitism as explanations for gene origin. Our findings paint a more complex picture of gene origin than can easily be explained by endosymbiotic gene transfer from an organelle-like point source. These data significantly extend the genomic impact of Chlamydiae on Plantae and show that about one-half (30 / 55) of the transferred genes are most closely related to sequences emanating from the genome of the only environmental isolate that is currently available.

40|$|We {{investigate}} anticipated synchronization {{between two}} periodically driven deterministic, dissipative inertia ratchets that {{are able to}} exhibit directed transport with a finite velocity.

The delay coupling involves two parameters: the coupling strength and the (positive-valued) delay time.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in biochemistry is how molecular machines convert chemical potential energy into mechanical work. Here, {{this problem is}} addressed {{in terms of how}} a proton gradient (ΔpH) drives anthrax toxin transmembrane protein translocation with a given directionality. One model to explain this phenomenon is a charge-state Brownian ratchet, wherein movement is biased by asymmetries across the membrane. Acidic residues in the substrate are protonated on the lower pH starting side, thus allowing them to pass through the cation-selective protective antigen (PA) channel. Movement can occur in either direction according to Brownian motion, but acidic residues that reach the higher pH of the destination are deprotonated, preventing retrotranslocation and resolving movement in one direction. This model is probed through the use of planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology to analyze the charge requirements of the model substrate LF N, the binding domain of the natural substrate lethal factor. Acidic residues are necessary and sufficient for ΔpH-driven translocation provided the starting side pH is low enough to sufficiently protonate the residues. Their position in the sequence, just before LF N 's folded domain, {{plays a key role in}} substrate unfolding. Basic charges are important for initiation into the channel and to chaperone deprotonated acidic residues during translocation. 	Further work by Sarah Wynia-Smith confirms the importance of acidic residues just before LF N 's folded domain and points to the existence of electrostatic translocation barriers in the PA channel. I identify key residues in the upper portion of the channel's β barrel that contribute to its cation selectivity. These residues also prove to play a significant role in substrate initiation and translocation, supporting the role for a charge gate in the channel that prevents retrotranslocation. Finally, secondary structure of the translocating substrate is analyzed. LF N translocates in a compact helical state nucleated by the channel's α clamp, a nonspecific helix-binding site recently identified by Geoffrey Feld. α clamp-induced helix formation lowers a previously identified but uncharacterized translocation barrier, and substrates that cannot form helices cannot translocate. This suggests a mechanism wherein helix melting, coupled to the electrostatic <b>ratchet,</b> <b>drives</b> translocation-coupled substrate unfolding...|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{mechanical}} {{motion of}} a particle in a periodic asymmetric potential is studied theoretically at zero temperature.

Dissipation enhances this asymmetry, and leads to a steady unidirectional current, resulting in a quantum ratchet system. Ratchet is a mechanism with a periodic asymmetric potential where unbiased external perturbation leads to an unidirectional motion.

40|$|Indirect {{effects may}} play an {{important}} role in structuring plant communities. Using a spatially explicit model of consumer foraging and plant competition, we demonstrate how the relationship between the spatial area over which plants compete and the spatial scale of consumer behaviour can determine the outcome of competition when one plant species provides a refuge for mobile consumers (i. e. refuge-mediated apparent competition). Once an initial population of the invader is established, complete invasion may be inevitable because of an ever-advancing invasion front <b>ratchets</b> forward <b>driven</b> by a feeding front of mobile consumers. Because the spatial extent of apparent competition determines the area available for colonization, consumers may also dictate the rate at which an invasion occurs. We find that, as long as refuge-mediated apparent competition is sufficiently localized, invasion is possible even in systems characterized by low overall levels of consumer pressure. Moreover, we show that a stable equilibrium can result in which both resident and invading plants coexist, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity created by refuge-mediated apparent competition may be important in mediating coexistence in plant communities. The spatial interplay of consumer behaviour and plant competition may be an underappreciated mechanism affecting the composition, diversity and spatial pattern of plant communities...|$|R
40|$|Cold {{atoms in}} optical lattices {{have emerged as}} an ideal system to {{investigate}} the ratchet effect, as demonstrated by several recent experiments. In this work we analyze theoretically two aspects of ac driven transport in cold atoms ratchets. We first {{address the issue of}} whether, and to which extent, an ac <b>driven</b> <b>ratchet</b> for cold atoms can operate as a motor. We thus study theoretically a dissipative motor for cold atoms, as obtained by adding a load to a 1 D non-adiabatically <b>driven</b> rocking <b>ratchet.</b> We demonstrate that a current can be generated also {{in the presence of a}} load, e. g. the ratchet device can operate as a motor. Correspondingly, we determine the stall force for the motor, which characterizes the range of loads over which the device can operate as a motor, and the differential mobility, which characterizes the response to a change in the magnitude of the load. Second, we compare our results for the transport in an ac <b>driven</b> <b>ratchet</b> device with the transport in a dc driven system. We observe a peculiar phenomenon: the bi-harmonic ac force stabilizes the dynamics, allowing the generation of uniform directed motion over a range of momentum much larger than what is possible with a dc bias. We explain such a stabilization of the dynamics by observing that a non-adiabatic ac drive broadens the effective cooling momentum range, and forces the atom trajectories to cover such a region. Thus the system can dissipate energy and maintain a steady-state energy balance. Our results show that in the case of a finite-range velocity-dependent friction, a ratchet device may offer the possibility of controlling the particle motion over a broader range of momentum with respect to a purely biased system, although this is at the cost of a reduced coherency...|$|R
