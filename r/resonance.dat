5|$|Currently Ariel is not {{involved}} in any orbital <b>resonance</b> with other Uranian satellites. In the past, however, it may have been in a 5:3 <b>resonance</b> with Miranda, which could have been partially responsible for the heating of that moon (although the maximum heating attributable to a former 1:3 <b>resonance</b> of Umbriel with Miranda was likely about three times greater). Ariel may have once been locked in the 4:1 <b>resonance</b> with Titania, from which it later escaped. Escape from a mean motion <b>resonance</b> is much easier for the moons of Uranus than for those of Jupiter or Saturn, due to Uranus's lesser degree of oblateness. This <b>resonance,</b> which was likely encountered about 3.8 billion years ago, would have increased Ariel's orbital eccentricity, resulting in tidal friction due to time-varying tidal forces from Uranus. This would have caused warming of the moon's interior by as much as 20K.|$|E
5|$|Currently Umbriel is not {{involved}} in any orbital <b>resonance</b> with other Uranian satellites. Early in its history, however, it may have been in a 1:3 <b>resonance</b> with Miranda. This would have increased Miranda's orbital eccentricity, contributing to the internal heating and geological activity of that moon, while Umbriel's orbit would have been less affected. Due to Uranus's lower oblateness and smaller size relative to its satellites, its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion <b>resonance</b> than those of Jupiter or Saturn. After Miranda escaped from this <b>resonance</b> (through a mechanism that probably resulted in its anomalously high orbital inclination), its eccentricity would have been damped, turning off the heat source.|$|E
5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of <b>resonance</b> to filter signals. Although electrical <b>resonance</b> had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic <b>resonance</b> (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical <b>resonance)</b> found its way into filter design ahead of electrical <b>resonance.</b> <b>Resonance</b> can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from <b>resonance.</b> Hence frequencies far from <b>resonance</b> are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{hypotheses}} for {{the origin}} of the Laplace <b>resonance</b> among Io, Europa, and Ganymede: that it is primordial and has existed {{from the beginning of the}} Solar System; or that it developed after the formation of the Solar System. A possible sequence of events for the latter scenario is as follows: Io raised tides on Jupiter, causing Io's orbit to expand (due to conservation of momentum) until it encountered the 2:1 <b>resonance</b> with Europa; after that the expansion continued, but some of the angular moment was transferred to Europa as the <b>resonance</b> caused its orbit to expand as well; the process continued until Europa encountered the 2:1 <b>resonance</b> with Ganymede.

40|$|Abstract. A {{new class}} of giant <b>resonances</b> in nuclei is discussed, i. e. giant <b>resonances</b> built on other giant <b>resonances.</b> These <b>resonances</b> are {{observed}} with very large cross sections in relativistic heavy ion collisions. A great experimental and theoretical effort is underway to understand the reaction mechanism {{which leads to the}} excitation of these states in nuclei, as well as the better microscopic understanding of their properties, for example, strength, energy centroids, widths and anharmonicities. 1. Giant <b>Resonances</b> 1. 1. Single giant <b>resonances</b> Giant <b>resonances</b> in nuclei were first observed in 1937 by Bothe and Gentner [1] who observed an unexpectedly large absorption of 17. 6 MeV photons (from the 7 Li. p; γ / reaction) in some targets. These observations were later confirmed by Baldwin and Klaiber (1947) with photons from a betatron. In 1948 Goldhaber and Teller [2] interpreted these <b>resonances</b> (called isovector giant dipole <b>resonances</b> (IVGDR)) with a hydrodynamical model in which rigid proton and neutron fluids vibrate against each other, the restoring force resulting from the surface energy.

5|$|Hiʻiaka orbits Haumea nearly circularly every 49days. Namaka orbits Haumea in 18 {{days in a}} {{moderately}} elliptical, non-Keplerian orbit, and as of 2008 was inclined 13° with respect to Hiʻiaka, which perturbs its orbit. Because the impact that created the moons of Haumea {{is thought to have}} occurred in the early history of the Solar System, over the following billions of years it should have been tidally damped into a more circular orbit. Namaka's orbit has likely been disturbed by orbital resonances with the more-massive Hiʻiaka due to converging orbits as they moved outward from Haumea due to tidal dissipation. They may have been caught in and then escaped from orbital <b>resonance</b> several times; they currently are in or at least close to an 8:3 <b>resonance.</b> This <b>resonance</b> strongly perturbs Namaka's orbit, which has a current precession of its argument of periapsis by about −6.5° per year, a precession period of 55 years.|$|E
