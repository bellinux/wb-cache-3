40|$|AbstractIn {{response}} to the increased used product disposal and scarcity of natural resources, the end-of-life (EOL) management has now becoming an important research field in manufacturing systems. The recovery operations for implementation are now more complicated than the traditional manufacturing as uncertainty of numerous sources do always exist. The process of selecting an appropriate combination of used components for a manufactured product {{is known as the}} product <b>recovery</b> <b>configuration.</b> For product <b>recovery</b> <b>configuration</b> selections, there are several possible alternatives, such as those parts and/or components to be reused, rebuilt, recycled and disposed. Each of these disposition alternatives may need to undergo various manufacturing processes in the industries. Due to the complexities of recovery operations, current recovery decision models focus mainly on the assessment in terms of cost, time, waste and quality separately. This article presents an integrated model to determine an optimal recovery plan for a manufacturer, which is to maximize its recovery value when producing a remanufactured product by considering practical constraints of the manufacturing lead-time, waste and quality as a whole. In the numerical example, the optimization model was solved using genetic algorithm. The obtained results showed that the selection of different product recovery configurations might have direct impact on the achievable recovery value of a remanufactured product for the manufacturer. Finally, the future works and contributions of this study are also briefly discussed...|$|E

In the first configuration, a fluidized bed membrane reactor (FBMR) is integrated in the H 2 plant: {{the natural gas}} reacts with steam in the catalytic bed and H 2 is simultaneously separated using Pd-based membranes, and the heat of reaction is provided to the system by feeding air as reactive sweep gas in part of the membranes and by burning part of the permeated H 2 (in order to avoid CO 2 emissions for heat supply).

The incineration is absolutely a system that offers both the mentioned opportunities (volume reduction and energy recovery). In fact the incineration is a rather developed system for the wastes elimination based on their energetic characteristics; in these years we have assisted to a considerable improvement both as concerns the efficiency of the plant, and also with reference to the environmental impact containment. The aim of this work is to analyze the wastes incineration plant under construction in Turin (Piedmont, North Italy). This incineration will be able to treat 421. 000 t/y of wastes with a LHV = 11 MJ/kg so the thermal power will be 206 MWth. The technology will be a grate combustor, the flue gas treatment will be constituted by an electro filter for the dust reduction, a dry scrubber for the acid gases absorption, injection of CaOH for the reduction of inorganic and organic components and a SCR system for the NOx reduction; the energy recovery will be obtained by a boiler and a stream turbine. In this work we evaluate, in particular, the energetic recovery system.
