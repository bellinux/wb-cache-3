The type of oil may be mineral or synthetic to suit the compressor type, and also chosen so as not to react with the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>type</b> and other components in the system. In small refrigeration systems the oil is allowed to circulate throughout the whole circuit, but care must be taken to design the pipework and components such that oil can drain back under gravity to the compressor. In larger more distributed systems, especially in retail refrigeration, the oil is normally captured at an oil separator immediately after the compressor, and is in turn re-delivered, by an oil level management system, back to the compressor(s). Oil separators are not 100% efficient so system pipework must still be designed so that oil can drain back by gravity to the oil separator or compressor.|$|E

40|$|The growing use of {{refrigeration}} and {{air conditioning}} systems and the shift in <b>refrigerant</b> <b>types</b> due to the Montreal Protocol lead to rapidly increasing HFC refrigerant emissions globally, especially in developing countries. Reducing the emission of these potent greenhouse gases globally seems to be indispensable in a successful long term climate strategy. The thesis uses quantitative vintage models as well as qualitative policy analysis to assess how various policy options to reduce refrigerant emissions and socio-economic developments may affect HFC emissions. It finds that local circumstances may influence policy options to reduce future HFC emissions differently in industrialized as well as developing countries. The current European approach to reduce emissions through a containment strategy at the final user stage {{is unlikely to be}} effective in developing countries, due to a limited financial and regulatory capacity and different priorities. However, a strategy aimed at inducing a technology shift at the producer stage, that leads to phasing-out HFC refrigerant use, may be able to reduce emissions globally. The thesis concludes that an effective long term climate policy should therefore aim at technology shift. In accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, it suggests starting in industrialized countries. The thesis further addresses the effect of increasing refrigeration {{and air conditioning}} system use on energy demand patterns. It finds that such development may change the temperature dependence of electricity demand.

40|$|Vapor {{compression}} refrigeration {{is commonly}} used on board the ships, R 134 a {{being one of the}} most spread <b>refrigerant</b> in this <b>type</b> of systems. In this work, a performance analysis of a vapor compression refrigeration cycle working with R 134 a and RE 170 was carried out. The motivation of this compar-ison is based on the efforts done {{to solve the problem of}} high GWP of R 134 a, since RE 170 shows a significantly lower one. The study is developed on the analysis of the effect of evaporation pressure on some of important factors which should be considered in the selection of a new refrigerant: evaporation pressure, pressure ratio, Coefficient of Performance, power per ton of refrigeration, volumetric cooling capacity. The evaporation temperature will vary in the range (− 20,+ 10) oC and the condensation temperature is kept constant, at 45 oC. Since cycle performance can be improved by superheating and sub cooling inclusion, these two processes were considered in the cycle. Comparative results show that RE 170 could replace R 134 a, due to its low evaporation pressure and pressure ratio and also to its better COP and similar volumetric cooling capacity. c © SEECMAR | All rights reserved 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{carbon dioxide}} (R- 744) {{as a natural}} {{refrigerant}} has been an attractive alternative refrigerant to replace HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) refrigerants currently used in air conditioning systems, due to the environmental concerns. Because new compressors with CO 2 {{are going to be}} operated under the high pressure, the tribology of sliding surfaces in the compressor becomes very important. To develop new compressor, especially scroll type, the friction and wear characteristics of sliding surfaces between a fixed scroll and an orbiting scroll in the scroll compressor were investigated in this paper. The sliding tests of pin-on-disk type were carried out between scroll surfaces under various sliding speeds, normal loads, surface roughness, and <b>refrigerant</b> pressures. Two <b>types</b> of lubricants were used, namely POE (polyol ester) oil and PAG (polyalkylene glycol) oil. The friction forces, wear amounts and surface temperatures were monitored during the tests. Test results showed that the wear amounts increased with increasing normal load and rotating speed, and also decreased with decreasing surface roughness. Also, the results of the sliding tests showed that using PAG oil has an advantage over POE oil in CO 2 environment. As the pressure of CO 2 refrigerant became higher, the amount of wear and coefficient of friction became larger in CO 2 /POE mixed environment, but wear and friction remained constant in CO 2 /PAG mixed environment. The wear coefficients in CO 2 /PAG and CO 2 /POE mixed environment were 8. 60 × 10 - 9 ㎣ /N·m and 2. 35 × 10 - 8 ㎣ /N·m, respectively...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and analytical study {{concerned with the}} off-design refrigerant charging of air conditioners is presented. A series of experiments were conducted to characterize the effects of <b>refrigerant</b> charge and <b>type</b> of expansion device on the system performance (capacity, EER, SEER, etc.) of an air conditioner. All experiments were performed according to the ASHRAE Standard [1983]. The effects of off-design refrigerant charge in the system, type of expansion device (capillary tube, TXV, and short-tube orifice), and outdoor dry-bulb temperature (82 ? to l 00 ?F) on the wet and dry steady state and cyclic tests are addressed in this study. The fully charged condition was established as a base case for all the expansion device systems. A full charge was obtained by charging the unit to the superheat or subcooled condition specified by the manufacturer charging chan. Once the full charge was determined, refrigerant was then added in 5 % increments from - 20 % of full charge to + 20 % of full charge to cover {{the full range of}} charging conditions for a particular expansion device being tested. The investigation of off-design charging indicated that the system performance variables (total capacity, EER, and SEER) of the unit with capillary tube were more sensitive to off-design charging than the systems with TXV and short-tube orifice. From - 20 % to + 20 % charging, the capacity and EER showed a strong dependence on the outdoor temperature, but varied little with charge for the TXV and short-tube orifice expansion systems. A - 20 % charging resulted in a 21 % reduction in SEER while a + 20 % charging produced an 11 % reduction in SEER for the unit with capillary tube. For the TXV, SEER dropped 2 % and 8 % for - 20 % and + 20 % refrigerant charging, respectively. The SEER was constant at 9. 4 for all the charging condition except for - 5 % charging where it peaked to 9. 9 for the short-tube orifice expansion system. This trend would suggest that the range of sensitivity of a short-tube orifice system is confined within a small refrigerant charge. A new heat exchanger model based on tube-by-tube simulation was developed and integrated into the ORNL heat pump model. The model was capable of simulating the steady state response of a vapor compression air-to-air heat pump and air conditioner commonly used in residential applications. The simulated results were compared with laboratory tests at two outdoor temperatures. It was found that the ORNL model estimates were within an average of 3 % of the experimental results from - 10 % to + 10 % charging conditions. The model predicted the system performance up to 8 % higher than measured results at +/- 20 % and +/- 15 % charging conditions. Among the eight void fraction models studied, the Hughmark model showed the best agreement between superheat and subcooled temperatures, refrigerant flow rate and capacity and the measured results...|$|R
