25|$|As was {{the custom}} among the luxury car brands, only the chassis and engine were displayed, since the {{interior}} and body of the car would be coachbuilt to the owner's specifications. The chassis on most Model Js were the same, as was the styling of such elements as fenders, headlamps, <b>radiator,</b> <b>hood</b> and instrument panel.|$|E
5000|$|From 1937 to 1939, the Bickle Fire Engine Company of Woodstock, Ontario, built fire engines using {{very similar}} sheet metal designs {{to those that}} Ahrens-Fox was using at that time, and as with Ahrens-Fox, these <b>radiators,</b> <b>hoods,</b> and fenders were also {{supplied}} to Bickle by Gramm Trucks of Lima, Ohio. Bickle had been Ahrens-Fox's Canadian sales and service agency from 1923 to 1936; starting in 1936, Bickle was the Canadian sales and service agency for Seagrave Corporation fire engines of Columbus, Ohio.|$|R

50|$|Volvo-White bought GMC's {{heavy truck}} {{business}} in 1987 creating the Volvo WhiteGMC brand. Volvo dropped {{any reference to}} White but used the Autocar bow-tie emblem on the <b>radiator</b> and <b>hood</b> side panels. The name changed to Volvo-Autocar in 1996.|$|R
5000|$|From 1930 to 1935, the Ahrens-Fox Fire Engine Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, {{had been}} {{building}} its smaller fire engines on chassis made by LeBlond-Schacht Truck Company, also of Cincinnati. But by 1935, Depression-weakened Ahrens-Fox owed Schacht so mauch money for chassis already supplied, that Schacht refused to supply any more truck chassis to AF. Ahrens-Fox the turned to Gramm Trucks of Lima, Ohio, to supply <b>radiators,</b> <b>hoods,</b> and fenders for its smaller fire trucks. Schacht Trucks bought-out Ahrens-Fox Company in 1936, and AF again began to build fire engines on Schacht chassis. But the Ahrens-Fox with Gramm sheet metal continued to be available until 1939. All of the smaller Ahrens-Fox apparatus of 1939-1940 were on Schacht chassis; Gramm/Ahrens-Fox models were no longer available starting in mid 1939. Schacht and Ahrens-Fox both ceased production of new vehicles in 1940, although Ahrens-Fox resumed production in 1946 and continued to be made until 1958 (but using their own custom chassis, no longer using Gramm or Schacht as suppliers).|$|R
50|$|Available body {{colors were}} Chevrolet (bow tie) Blue or Gunmetal Grey. The <b>hood,</b> <b>radiator</b> and fenders were all painted black. The Chassis and wheels were bow tie blue. Also {{included}} was Light grey pin striping {{on the wheel}} spokes and hood vents.|$|R
5000|$|The New Haven-built Continentals had {{front-mounted}} four cylinder engines. Pictures {{indicate that}} power {{was brought to}} the rear wheels by a pair of chains. These cars are easily recognizable by their perfectly round <b>radiator</b> and barrel-shaped <b>hood.</b> There was a large script reading [...] "Continental" [...] and [...] "New Haven" [...] in the underlining.|$|R
5000|$|The largest {{highway truck}} sold by Peterbilt at its launch, the 379 was {{produced}} in two configurations. The standard hood created a BBC (bumper to back of cab length) of 119 inches. To allow for larger engines and <b>radiators,</b> an extended <b>hood</b> configuration was available, which made for a 127-inch BBC. Although sharing the bare cab structure with the 359, the 379 was produced with a slightly larger windshield and horizontally-mounted windshield wipers.|$|R
5000|$|To {{create a}} modern {{envelope}} body while retaining those famous hallmarks was no small undertaking. It {{is still one}} of the chief accomplishments of automotive industrial design that the people who created the Packard Clipper were able to do so flawlessly. Advertising invited America to [...] "Skipper the Clipper" [...] in 1941. It was showing the country an obviously brand-new, up-to-date, in Packard's words, [...] "Windstream" [...] or [...] "Speed-Stream" [...] automobile, yet one which was still undeniably a Packard. Though it did not owe a curve or contour to any previous model, the milestone 1941 Clipper carried the same inimitable <b>radiator</b> and <b>hood</b> shape, as well as the same arrowheads and red hexes, and the same long hood and close-coupled profile of great Packards of the past. The smooth styling transition was a stroke of genius.|$|R
5000|$|The NW4, {{of which}} two {{examples}} were {{built for the}} Missouri Pacific Railroad, used the hood and cab configuration of the regular N-series, but with an additional straight section between cab and hood, mounted on a lengthened frame with large air tanks on the front platform, {{in front of the}} <b>radiator.</b> The additional <b>hood</b> section contained a steam generator; [...] The water tanks were mounted beneath the frame; the air tanks were therefore displaced to the front. The locomotives ran on AAR type B trucks re-used from EMC boxcab demonstrators #511 and 512. The two NW4s were EMC S/N 823 and 824, and were MP #4102 and 4103. They were scrapped in 1961.|$|R
5000|$|Starting {{with this}} {{generation}} on February 1971, the Cedric and Gloria were {{essentially the same}} vehicle, with the Gloria being more upscale than the Cedric. The hood ornament is a stylized version of the Japanese Paper Crane (Orizuru). The primary differences are the <b>hood,</b> <b>radiator</b> grille, taillights and wheel covers. This generation saw Nissan use the [...] "coke bottle styling" [...] appearance, shared with other 1970s Nissan products. The front of the vehicle shares some visual appearances with the 1967-1968 Mercury Marquis.The four-cylinder is the H20-series OHV engine, with the 6-cylinder engine using the L20 twin carburetor, sourced from manufacturer SU carburetor. The H20P uses LPG for fuel, and the SD20 OHV is a diesel engine. The SD20 {{was the first time}} a diesel engine was offered in a Gloria.|$|R
