5|$|The fire, {{caused by}} the {{malfunction}} of a backup solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG), burned for, according to various sources, between 90 seconds and 14 minutes, and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don <b>respirators,</b> {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} modules were immovable. The fire occurred during a crew rotation, and as such there were six men aboard the station rather than the usual three. Access to one of the docked Soyuz lifeboats was blocked, which would have prevented escape by half of the crew. A similar incident had occurred on an earlier Mir expedition, although in that case the SFOG burned for only a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|Several {{accidents}} occurred which {{threatened the}} station's safety, {{such as the}} glancing collision between Kristall and Soyuz TM-17 during proximity operations in January 1994. The three most alarming incidents occurred during EO-23. The first was on 23 February 1997 during the handover period from EO-22 to EO-23, when a malfunction occurred in the backup Vika system, a chemical oxygen generator later known as solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG). The Vika malfunction led to a fire which burned for around 90 seconds (according to official sources at the TsUP; astronaut Jerry Linenger insists the fire burned for around 14 minutes), and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don <b>respirators,</b> {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Some of the fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} newer modules were immovable.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} a {{filtering}} half-face <b>respirator</b> and a half-face supplied air <b>respirator</b> use on blood lactate production was assessed during maximal exertion to determine if anaerobic strain increased compared to no <b>respirator</b> use. Twenty-eight participants performed a 30 second cycling Wingate anaerobic test (WAnT) wearing a half-face <b>respirator.</b> Blood lactate production was measured to evaluate {{if there was an}} increase in anaerobic strain from wearing a tight fitting half-face <b>respirator</b> compared to wearing no <b>respirator.</b> A supplied air <b>respirator</b> WAnT was then performed using 18 participants from the first experiment to evaluate if supplied air decreased anaerobic strain.

5|$|Work {{continued}} {{throughout the}} night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the roof supports to become unstable, and falls triggered outbursts of methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of the firefighters wrote what they thought might be their last letters home, and some made their wills. As the water pipe in the shaft was out of operation, fire-fighting continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts. Despite wearing <b>respirators,</b> several rescuers were overcome by the effects of firedamp. During {{the course of the}} day, 56 bodies were raised to the surface and, that evening, a new water supply, connected by three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) of pipes to a nearby reservoir, was installed in the Lancaster shaft.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{there was}} no {{information}} on the effectiveness for <b>respirators</b> of specific design (type) in the workplace. This {{is due to the}} fact that the measurement of workplace PF is very difficult, time consuming, and expensive work, which was carried out not very often. For these types of <b>respirators</b> experts used the results of WPF measurements of other types of <b>respirators,</b> which are similar. For example, the effectiveness of the Supplied Air <b>Respirators</b> (SARs, with hose) was considered similar to the efficiency of Powered Air Purifying <b>Respirators</b> (PAPRs), if they have the same facepieces and the same air supply mode. Finally, in the absence of this information, specialists could use the results of Simulated WPF measurements; or estimates of competent experts.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{effectiveness}} of <b>respirators</b> were evaluated with their tests in the laboratories. But detection of cases of excessive exposure of harmful agents on those workers who properly used and maintained approved <b>respirators</b> (with high efficiency filters), has prompted experts to change their opinions. In the late 1960s, researchers found that real effectiveness of <b>respirators</b> in the workplaces were significantly lower than during tests in laboratories.|$|E

Experts in the two countries often used the results of the same studies of WPF (because of their limited number). For example, British standard had been developed with usage of results of 1897 WPF measurements during 31 studies; and 23 of this 31 studies had been conducted in United States.|$|E

40|$|Medical {{certification}} of workers for <b>respirator</b> use {{is an important}} activity of occupational medicine health professionals. Spirometry is a diagnostic tool to evaluate respiratory distress/insufficiency that may affect <b>respirator</b> use. In this study, we analyzed the pulmonary function data of 337 workers from different occupations which required medical evaluation to wear a <b>respirator.</b> The American Thoracic Society and National Fire Protection Association criteria were used to evaluate employees. Of 337 workers who were cleared for respiratory use {{on the basis of}} medical questionnaires for <b>respirator</b> compliance, 14 (4. 15 %) failed to pass <b>respirator</b> compliance on the basis of NFPA criteria and 5 (1. 48 %) failed to pass <b>respirator</b> compliance criteria on the basis of ATS criteria. We compared the use of different Spirometric equations to evaluate these criteria and we found the Crapo equation cleared more workers for <b>respirator</b> use as compared to the Knudson and NHANES III equations. We also measured repeated Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 st Second (FEV 1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and compared the results longitudinally over time. Age was the only significant factor affecting the reduction in the lung function in longitudinal analysis. Longitudinal spirometry results suggested that workers were protected while using a <b>respirator</b> in the workplace, but age is the significant factor in reducing their lung function. As some workers were able to qualify for <b>respirator</b> use based on questionnaire alone but failed <b>respirator</b> clearance subsequent to pulmonary function testing, it is recommended that spirometry be used to evaluate clearance for all workers who will use a <b>respirator</b> in the workplace. As well, using different Spirometric equations can affect the outcome on passing or failing clearance for <b>respirator</b> use, and this should be considered in a respiratory medical certification program...|$|R

25|$|If the use {{of these}} methods is impossible, or if their use did not reduce the {{concentration}} of harmful substances to a safe value, workers must use <b>respirators.</b> These <b>respirators</b> must be sufficiently effective, and they should correspond to known or expected conditions at the workplace. However, it is the least effective method of protection; and the reasons for the decrease of their efficiency often are: non-usage of the <b>respirators</b> in the contaminated atmosphere; leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps between the mask and face; and delayed replacement of gas cartridges.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of {{respiratory protective equipment}} is unstable and unpredictable. <b>Respirators</b> cannot substitute other measures, that reduce the impact of air pollution on the staff (sealing equipment, ventilation and so on), but only supplement them. <b>Respirators</b> are not convenient, they create discomfort and irritation, and prevent communication.

25|$|The {{initial stage}} of {{research}} yielded the following results: experts developed a common terminology {{to describe the}} protective properties of the respirators; a methodology for measuring protection factors in different conditions of respirators' usage in the workplaces and laboratories; and the realization that national legislation should set limits {{for the use of}} all types of <b>respirators</b> based on their performance, measured not in the laboratory, but in the workplaces. The first studies also clearly confirmed that the use of <b>respirators</b> is the most unreliable method of protecting workers from all known methods.
