5|$|The {{highway is}} known as National Pike because it follows the {{original}} alignment of the historic National Road. As a result, there are many historic sites along Alt US40, including the Casselman Bridge in Grantsville and the last remaining National <b>Road</b> <b>toll</b> gate house in Maryland, located in LaVale.|$|E
5|$|East of Eckhart Mines, Alt US40 {{passes through}} Clarysville, where it intersects MD55. It is near Clarysville that the terrain {{followed}} by Alt US40 changes: from Clarysville westward {{to the summit}} of Savage Mountain, the road runs uphill, while east of Clarysville, the road follows valleys, first following the valley around Braddock Run to Cumberland, and then following the valley around Wills Creek into Cumberland. Near the MD55 intersection is a stone arch bridge which was initially built in 1812 and rebuilt in the 1830s, and carried the National Road over Braddock Run, a tributary to Wills Creek. East of Clarysville, the highway passes through a gap carved by Braddock Run between Piney Mountain and Dan's Mountain. I-68, having been built later, {{is located on the}} hillside above Alt US40, on the Dan's Mountain side of the gap. Alt US40 then descends Red Hill into LaVale. At the bottom of Red Hill is the La Vale toll gate house. Built in 1836, tolls were collected there until the early 1900s, and it is the last original National <b>Road</b> <b>toll</b> gate house standing in Maryland. In LaVale, the route intersects MD53, which serves as a truck bypass for US 220 to Cresaptown. Alt US40 interchanges with westbound I-68 at exit 39, but eastbound access is only available via MD53 and MD658, which intersects Alt US40 east of the exit 39 interchange. The highway expands to a four-lane road near its intersection with MD53, then narrows to a two-lane road near its intersection with MD658. East of the intersection with MD658, Alt US40 turns northward, passing through LaVale toward the Narrows, bypassing Haystack Mountain to the north, as opposed to I-68, which passes directly over Haystack Mountain, paralleling Braddock Road (MD49).|$|E

5|$|While the Silver Line was {{originally}} planned to terminate at Stadium-Armory, in 2012 {{the plan was}} changed for the line to end at Largo Town Center instead, because Stadium-Armory's pocket track is too short for trains to turn around. It follows the Blue and Orange Line tracks through DC, continuing through Arlington along the Orange Line and branching off immediately east of the West Falls Church station. The new tracks run in the median of the Dulles Connector Road to an elevated bridge, which takes them over Virginia Route 123. Two elevated stops along {{the west side of}} Route 123 serve the national headquarters of CapitalOne, SAIC and two enclosed Tysons Corner shopping malls. The tracks then enter a tunnel which emerges in the median of Virginia Route 7. Two elevated stations above Route 7 serve the western section of Tysons Corner. The elevated track then swings into the median of the Dulles Access Road until it reaches the airport. Along the way, five new stations would be built with platforms in the median of the access road and a faregate and pedestrian bridges to parking areas elevated above the highway. In anticipation of the Herndon station being built, in 1999 Fairfax County constructed a 1,750-space parking garage with ramps to the Dulles Access <b>Road</b> <b>toll</b> lanes and this facility is being used for bus commuters on an interim basis. The garage has drawn criticism because of alleged construction flaws. As originally planned, upon reaching the airport the track will enter a tunnel which will follow the path of the arrivals driveway of the airport terminal to a station located close to the terminal. The track would leave the tunnel near the airport hotel and economy parking lots and would head north parallel to the main runways. A storage yard and maintenance facility would branch off to the west occupying the airport's buffer zone north of the end of its major runways. The final two stops would be in the median of the Dulles Greenway, serving the Ashburn suburb. Hence, the line is expected to draw both airport traffic and commuters from the far western suburbs of Washington, DC. Buses currently provide these users with limited public transportation. In contrast, the Silver Line is expected to provide trains once every six minutes during rush hours and once every fourteen minutes during non-rush hours.|$|E
25|$|Tolls (tolgelden): Tolls {{were charged}} {{to cross the}} borders of most heerlijkheden. This {{was a kind of}} <b>road</b> <b>toll</b> (wegentol), but it also took the form of a charge on the {{transport}} of specific commodities (e.g. salt) or people.|$|E

25|$|From 1850 to 1890, {{city limits}} in the West and the South mainly {{followed}} another wall called Linienwall {{at which a}} <b>road</b> <b>toll</b> called the Liniengeld was charged. Outside this wall from 1873 onwards a ring road called GÃ¼rtel was built. In 1890 {{it was decided to}} integrate 33 suburbs (called Vororte) beyond that wall into Vienna by 1 January 1892 and transform them into districts no. 11 to 19 (district no. 10 had been constituted in 1874); hence the Linienwall was torn down beginning in 1894. In 1900, district no. 20, Brigittenau, was created by separating the area from the 2nd district.|$|E
25|$|Later, in {{the spring}} of '71, Captain William Meade would bring in a pack train from Hazelton, and he would make many {{improvements}} on that trail. Despite the fact that these roads were built and improved during the rush years, the trip was still perilous and very costly. Steamer fare on the Fraser River on the Enterprise or the Victoria was $25 and 12.5 cents a pound was added for baggage. Smaller boats near the gold fields charged $7 for the ride and 7 cents a pound for baggage. At Takla Landing, yet more money was required, as that was a <b>road</b> <b>toll</b> that charged 18 cents a pound for baggage.|$|E
25|$|Fares to {{and from}} Miami International Airport (MIA) and popular {{destinations}} {{are based on a}} zone system which covers Key Biscayne, Miami Beach and other communities east of the Intracoastal Waterway in Miami-Dade County, Coral Gables, and the Port of Miami, as well as short trips in the airport vicinity. For example, a trip from MIA to South Beach (approximately 11 miles) will cost passengers a flat fare of $32 (as of June 2009), inclusive of tolls and temporary fuel surcharges which rise and fall with fuel costs. An April 2011 study conducted by the Chicago Dispatcher showed that Miami taxis have moderately high fares, charging an estimated $16.10 for a distance of five miles and five minutes wait time (compared to an estimated $14.30 in Hillsborough County, FL and $18.20 in Palm Beach County, FL). Fares outside of these zones (including to Fort Lauderdale and Broward County) are metered; the first 1/6 of a mile costs $2.50, with each additional 1/6 of a mile costing $0.40 (not including any road tolls). An additional $2 surcharge (automatically included in zone fares) applies for trips to MIA or the seaport. As an example, a trip from MIA to Dolphin Mall, a distance of approximately 9.2 miles, would cost a passenger $27.25 (as of June 2009, including a $0.75 <b>road</b> <b>toll</b> and the $2 surcharge). A fuel surcharge may also be added to fares if gas prices reach $3.50 per gallon or more for three consecutive weeks. Tipping is not required, but is expected by most Miami taxicab drivers.|$|E

500|$|From 1970 to 1973, much {{legislation}} {{passed through the}} South Australian Parliament. Workers saw increases in welfare, drinking laws were further liberalised, an Ombudsman was created, censorship was liberalised, seat belts were made mandatory, the education system was overhauled, and the public service was gradually increased (doubling in size during the Dunstan era). Adelaide's water supply was fluoridated in 1971 {{and the age of}} majority was lowered from 21 to 18. A Commissioner of Consumer Affairs was created, a demerit point system was introduced to penalise poor driving practices in an attempt to cut the <b>road</b> <b>toll,</b> and compensation for workers was improved. Police autonomy and powers were restricted following a rally in opposition to the Vietnam War, which was broken up by police, although Dunstan had wanted the demonstrators to be able to close off the street. A royal commission was called into the police commissioner's disregard for Dunstan's orders, and resulted in legislation giving the government more control over the police; the commissioner then retired. The dress code for the Parliament was relaxed during this period, the suit and tie was no longer seen as obligatory, and Dunstan himself caused media frenzy when he arrived at Parliament House in 1972 wearing pink shorts that ended above his knees. After his departure from public life he admitted that his sartorial statement may have gone beyond the limits. Nevertheless, his fashion sense resulted in his being voted [...] "the sexiest political leader in Australia" [...] by Woman's Day in 1975, and the image of Dunstan in the shorts remains iconic.|$|E
