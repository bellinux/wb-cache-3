We analyze the earnings levels for two groups of companies, impairers and non- impairers in both 2005 and 2006 years. Results andConclusionFindings suggest (a) firms recording impairment charges possess lower earnings than do their counterparts not recording write downs and (b) the impairment losses are likely reported as timely opportunity to taking “big bath” and increasing future earnings.

40|$|<b>Asset</b> <b>impairment</b> is a {{relatively}} new term in the corporate reporting arena. However, the concept of <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> relates closely to that of an asset write-down. Asset write-downs historically have been a feature of corporate reporting for many years (Lee, 1975)) due to the principle of conservatism, although largely discretionary in nature in the UK until the introduction of Financial Reporting Standard 11 <b>Impairment</b> of <b>Assets</b> and Goodwill (FRS 11) in 1998. <b>Asset</b> <b>impairment</b> is defined by the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in FRS 11 as the situation of: A reduction in the recoverable amount of a fixed asset or goodwill below its carrying amount (paragraph 2). Recoverable amount in this context is the higher of net realisable value or value in use. Prior to the issue of regulations in the area of <b>asset</b> <b>impairment,</b> there was very little guidance for corporations which may have been faced with large impairment losses. This could result in some discretion in terms of the timing and how to account <b>for</b> any <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> charge, <b>for</b> example either an adjustment to reserves or an expense in the income statement. The aim of this thesis is to explore the practice of <b>impairment</b> of <b>assets</b> in UK published financial statements and evaluate the concept and suitability of impairment as a means of recognising and subsequently measuring a decline in the value of a non current asset and the implications of this process. An assessment of the impact of international standards in relation to <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> being operational from January 2005 for UK listed corporations is also undertaken. The sample consists of those corporations listed on the UK Financial Times 100 Index (FTSE 100) of leading corporations from the period from 2003 to 2007 - 8. The thesis evaluates the extent of earnings management associated with <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> charges, {{both before and after the}} change in the regulatory environment. An assessment of whether an increase or decrease in the earnings characteristics of corporations takes place as a result of a change in the regulatory environment is also evaluated. Additionally the thesis provides a detailed assessment of the extent of disclosure associated with charging an <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> loss and whether this is associated with the size of the <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> loss. The measurement and valuation methods employed to implement an <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> loss are also evaluated. Other key areas of investigation focus on <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> losses being associated with a particular category of asset, business sector, indicator of <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> and a change of management. Fair value forms a component of <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> loss recognition and this thesis contributes to the debate about the ability of a fair value measurement approach to provide a true and fair view of the corporation...|$|R

40|$|Prior to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (SFAS No. 121) : Accounting for the <b>Impairment</b> of Long-Lived <b>Assets</b> and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, {{managers}} had substantial discretion {{concerning the}} amount and timing of reporting writedowns of long-lived assets. Moreover, the frequency and dollar amount of asset writedown announcements {{that led to a}} large “surprise” caused the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to consider the need for a new standard to guide the recording of <b>impairment</b> of long-lived <b>assets.</b> This study has two primary objectives. First, it investigates the effects of SFAS No. 121 on <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> reporting, examining whether SFAS No. 121 reduces the magnitude and restricts the timing of reporting asset writedowns. Second, the study compares the information content (surprise element) of the <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> loss announcement as measured by cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) before and after the issuance of SFAS No. 121. The findings provide support for the hypothesis that the FASB's new accounting standard does not affect the magnitude of asset writedown losses. The findings also provide support for the hypothesis that SFAS No. 121 does not affect the management choice of the timing <b>for</b> reporting <b>asset</b> writedowns. In addition, the findings suggest that the market evaluates the asset writedown losses after the issuance of SFAS No. 121 as good news for “big bath” firms, while, for “income smoothing” firms, the market does not respond to the announcements of asset writedown losses either before or after the issuance of SFAS No. 121. The findings also suggest that, for “big bath” firms, the market perceives the announcement of <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> losses after the adoption of SFAS No. 121 as more credible relative to that before its issuance. This could be because the practice of reporting asset writedowns after the issuance of SFAS No. 121 is under the FASB's authoritative guidance, which brings consistency and comparability in <b>asset</b> <b>impairment</b> reporting...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis aims {{to address}} four {{research}} {{questions related to}} the effects of IAS- 36 adoption in Europe: firstly, whether the adoption of IAS- 36 impairment rules, per se, improved management’s practice of <b>asset</b> appraisal and <b>impairment</b> reporting; secondly, whether earnings management, generated through the reporting of IAS- 36 impairment losses and concurrent discretional accruals, is fairly used in order to genuinely convey additional trustworthy information about management’s negative expectations of persistent decline in future firm performance (informative earnings management), or cunningly abused to artificially boost the future operating and stock performance of the firm (opportunistic earnings management); thirdly, whether investors are able (or not able) to discriminate between informative and opportunistic earnings management, and the market attributes (or does not attribute) to the content of such earnings management the appropriate value relevance for the determination of firms’ stock returns; and fourthly, whether the adoption of supra-national IAS- 36 impairment rules enhanced the harmonization of management’s practice of impairment reporting across European countries. This thesis examines, firstly, the regulatory aspects of IAS- 36 in order to identify methodological aspects and interpretational issues, unaddressed by the IASB, which management might use to put into practice alternative accounting policies. The analysis shows that methodological and interpretative flexibility relates firstly to the regulations for the determination of the appropriate dimension of a cash generating unit (CGU) <b>for</b> non-standalone <b>assets</b> such as goodwill; secondly, to the rules for the identification of a proper discount rate for the estimate of the discounted cash flow for the computation of the assets’ value in use (VIU); thirdly, to the procedure for the calculation of the value in use of a CGU, when it includes an essential standalone asset which can be individually evaluated; and fourthly, to the alternative options for the allocation of common assets, such as goodwill and other non-financial intangible assets, either to many CGUs or to a new CGU of superior level. Qualitative evidence shows that, in these cases, the discretion allowed by IAS- 36 enables management to put in practice alternative accounting policies suitable to either conceal <b>asset</b> <b>impairments</b> or to drive their overall value, and hence the correlated earnings sum, towards the desired amount. Additionally, focusing on a wide sample of 3, 720 firms and 47, 651 firm-year observations from 16 European countries, this thesis undertakes an extensive empirical study of the effect of IAS- 36 on quality and harmonization of management's practice of impairment reporting, by contrasting the determinants of their asset impairments’ decisions (likelihood and magnitude of the reported impairments), namely economic factors, managerial incentives and disincentives, and country-specific factors, before and after the adoption of IAS- 36. Empirical findings reveal a weaker association between <b>asset</b> <b>impairments,</b> of either goodwill, or other intangible, or tangible assets, with economic factors after the adoption of IAS- 36. Furthermore, the results indicate that after the adoption of IAS- 36 managerial reporting incentives and disincentives play a lower role in explaining tangible <b>asset</b> <b>impairments,</b> but play a substantially larger role in explaining discretional <b>asset</b> <b>impairments</b> such as goodwill or other intangible <b>asset</b> <b>impairments.</b> In addition, the results show a weaker association between <b>asset</b> <b>impairments</b> and country-specific factors after the adoption of IAS- 36. Finally, focusing on a sample of 4, 192 IAS- 36 asset-impairment observations from 16 European countries, this thesis carries out an empirical study of the informative content of impairment-based and accrual-based earnings management, by analysing the pattern of discretional accruals reported concurrently and subsequently to IAS- 36 <b>asset</b> <b>impairments</b> and the corresponding pattern of firms’ operating and stock performance. In addition, this empirical study examines the association of write-down charges and concurrent discretional accruals with stock market returns. Results show that firms use earnings management differently in different circumstances. In particular, firms which report multiple impairments, use their discretion {{at the time of the}} initial <b>asset</b> <b>impairments</b> with the aim of fairly disclosing an actual permanent reduction of those assets’ ability to contribute to their business’s value (informative earnings management). In contrast, firms which report single impairments, use their discretion at the time of initial asset write-offs, with the objective of artificially boosting their future operating and stock performance (opportunistic earnings management). Furthermore, with reference to single impairments, findings give evidence that opportunistic earnings management can be circumscribed to goodwill and other intangible impairments, whose rules allow space for subjectivity and arbitrary choices. Additionally, results show that investors are unable to fully discriminate between informative and opportunistic earnings management at the moment of initial <b>asset</b> <b>impairments.</b> Therefore, they are particularly cautious towards those asset categories which are more susceptible of being abused for opportunistic reasons, such as goodwill and other intangibles, at that time, when the information asymmetry is higher. Consistently, they are more reliant on those asset categories which are less likely to be abused, such as PPE and subsequent <b>asset</b> <b>impairments</b> in general. These results hold, when moving from low to high levels of auditing quality and from low to high levels of security law quality and enforcement, confirming that management’s practice of IAS- 36 impairment reporting and discretional accruals is not driven by country-specific factors. Overall, empirical evidence supports the view that the adoption of IAS- 36 has increased the harmonization of impairment reporting practice across European countries; however such harmonization has consisted in levelling the quality of impairment reporting practice towards a lower level, rather than in increasing it to a higher standard. ...|$|R

The failure to perform needed repairs could lead to asset deterioration and ultimately <b>asset</b> <b>impairment.</b> Generally, a policy of continued deferred maintenance may result in higher costs, asset failure, and in some cases, health and safety implications.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} reserve {{requirements}} of OECD countries. Reserve requirements are the minimum percentages or amounts of liabilities that depository institutions {{are required to}} keep in cash or as deposits with their central banks. To facilitate monetary policy implementation, twenty-four of the thirty OECD countries impose reserve requirements to influence their banking systems’ demand for liquidity. These include twelve OECD countries that are also members of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and twelve non-EMU OECD countries. All EMU countries employ a single reserve requirement system, which is treated as one entity.; The <b>reserve</b> requirement system <b>for</b> each of the twelve non-EMU countries is discussed separately. The similarities and differences among the thirteen reserve requirement systems are highlighted. The features of reserve requirements covered include: reservable liabilities, required reserve ratios, reserve computation periods, reserve maintenance periods, types of reserve requirements, calculations of required <b>reserves,</b> eligible <b>assets</b> <b>for</b> satisfying <b>reserve</b> requirements, remuneration on reserve balances, non-compliance penalties, carry-over of reserve balances, and required clearing balances.

I. Current international standards for the statistical treatment of the issue 2. BPM 5 describes in paragraph 431 the concept of “available for use, ” which is a key criterion <b>for</b> an <b>asset</b> to be classified as a reserve asset. In describing the availability for use of an asset it is stated that this “is partly dependent on any conditionality that affects the asset—including, as one main aspect, the liquidity or marketability of the asset. ” and “Owne...|$|R
