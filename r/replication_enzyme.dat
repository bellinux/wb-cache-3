Although the replication mechanisms of these organellar genomes remain unclear in photosynthetic eukaryotes, several organelle-localized enzymes related to genome replication, including DNA polymerase, DNA primase, DNA helicase, DNA topoisomerase, single-stranded DNA maintenance protein, DNA ligase, primer removal enzyme, and several DNA recombination-related enzymes, have been identified. In the reference Eudicot plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the replication-related enzymes of plastids and mitochondria are similar {{because many of}} them are dual targeted to both organelles, whereas in the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae, plastids and mitochondria contain different replication machinery components. The enzymes involved in organellar genome replication in green plants and red algae were derived from different origins, including proteobacterial, cyanobacterial, and eukaryotic lineages. In the present review, we summarize the available data for enzymes related to organellar genome replication in green plants and red algae.

50|$|The {{relatively}} small number of primase inhibitors likely reflects the inherent difficulty of primase assays rather than a lack of potential binding sites on the enzyme. The short length of products synthesized and the generally slow rate of the enzyme compared to other <b>replication</b> <b>enzymes</b> make developing high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches more difficult. Despite the difficulties, there are several known inhibitors of DnaG that are not NTP analogues. Doxorubicin and suramin are both DNA and NTP competitive inhibitors of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis DnaG. Suramin is also known to inhibit eukaryotic DNA primase by competing with GTP, so suramin is likely to inhibit DnaG via a similar mechanism.|$|R

In the present study, we use a combined approach comprising clinical, electrophysiological, neuropathological and molecular genetic investigations to unravel the mechanisms underpinning peripheral neuronopathy in autosomal recessive polymerase -related disease. Electrophysiological assessments documented a dorsal root ganglionopathy in all 11 cases. Of the 11 cases, eight also showed changes consistent with motor fibre loss.

Several attempts to produce the wild-type biologically active PsyRep in Escherichia coil failed, possibly due to auto-regulation of the protein population.

40|$|As with {{transcription}} from DNA templates, RNA synthesis from viral RNA templates must initiate accurately.

This determinant's addition could convert a cellular tRNA into a template for RNA synthesis by the BMV replicase in vitro.

Retroviral proteases display significant differences in specificity requirements. Here, we show a comparison of substrate specificities of several retroviral proteases on vimentin as a substrate.

40|$|Although DNA {{replication}} is {{a process}} common in all domains of life, primase and replicative DNA polymerase appear to have evolved independently in the bacterial domain versus the archaeal/eukaryal branch of life. Here, we report on {{a new type of}} replication protein that constitutes the first member of the DNA polymerase family E. The protein ORF 904, encoded by the plasmid pRN 1 from the thermoacidophile archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus, is a highly compact multifunctional enzyme with ATPase, primase and DNA polymerase activity. Recombinant purified ORF 904 hydrolyses ATP in a DNA-dependent manner. Deoxynucleotides are preferentially used for the synthesis of primers ∼ 8  nucleotides long. The DNA polymerase activity of ORF 904 synthesizes replication products of up to several thousand nucleotides in length. The primase and DNA polymerase activity are located in the N-terminal half of the protein, which does not show homology to any known DNA polymerase or primase.

40|$|The <b>replication</b> <b>enzyme</b> of RNA viruses must pref-erentially {{recognize}} their RNAs {{in an environment}} that contains an abundance of cellular RNAs. The factors responsible for specific RNA recognition are not well understood, in part because viral RNA synthesis takes place within enzyme complexes associated with modified cellular membrane com-partments. Recombinant RNA-dependent RNA poly-merases (RdRps) from the human norovirus and the murine norovirus (MNV) were found to preferentially recognize RNA segments that contain the promoter and a short template sequence for subgenomic RNA synthesis. Both the promoter and template sequence contribute to stable RdRp binding, accurate initiation of the subgenomic RNAs and efficient RNA synthe-sis. Using a method that combines RNA crosslinking and mass spectrometry, residues near the template channel of the MNV RdRp were found to contact the hairpin RNA motif. Mutations in the hairpin contact site in the MNV RdRp reduced MNV replication and virus production in cells.

BAYr 1 has two substitutions in the HSV- 1 helicase (UL 5) protein (A 4 to V; K 356 to Q) and BAYr 2 has one (G 352 to R).

40|$|Yeast {{replication}} origins {{contain a}} DNA sequence element whose biological activity correlates with hypersensitivity to single-strand-specific nucleases in negatively supercoiled plasmids. By using {{two-dimensional gel electrophoresis}} of plasmid topoisomers, we demonstrate that thermodynamically stable origin unwinding accounts for the nuclease hypersensitivity and, furthermore, that increased thermal energy facilitates stable origin unwinding in vitro. In living cells, increased thermal energy can suppress origin mutations that raise the free-energy cost for unwinding the nuclease-hypersensitive element. Specifically, mutational defects in autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) -mediated plasmid replication are less severe in cells grown at 30 degrees C as compared to 23 degrees C. Our findings indicate that the energetics of DNA unwinding at the nuclease-hypersensitive element are biologically important.

Telomere length is maintained by a balance between processes that lengthen and those that shorten telomeres. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein polymerase that specifically elongates telomeres. In human cells telomere length is not maintained and telomerase is not active in some tissues. In tumors, however, telomerase is active and may be required {{for the growth of}} cancer cells.
