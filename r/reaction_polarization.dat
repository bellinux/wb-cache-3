The results showed 2, 4 -Ddihydrazino- 6 -methoxy- 1, 3, 5 -triaizine (DHMeT) gave the best corrosion protection performance {{among the other}} hydrazino derivatives even at a low concentration of 25 ppm (95 %). The number of hydrazino groups {{play an important role}} in the corrosion inhibition, where the two hydrazine groups increased the electrostatic interactions between the protonated tested compounds, the negatively charged steel surface resulted from the adsorption of the chloride anions, and the presence of the methoxy group made the compound more reliable for formation of film protection on the surface of steel through the lone pair of oxygen atoms. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements suggested that the corrosion process of steel in presence of the hydrazino-s-triazine derivatives (TH 3, DMeHT and DHMeT) were being controlled by the charge transfer <b>reaction.</b> <b>Polarization</b> curves indicated that the examined TH 3, DMeHT and DHMeT behaved as mixed type inhibitors...|$|E

40|$|We {{have succeeded}} in {{fabricating}} a solid-oxide-electrolyte fuel cell, with the highest power-generation density, with a maxi-mum single-cell-level density of 1550 mW/cm 2. This cell was made by depositing a 10 i~m thick 10 mol % (m/o) yttria stabilized zir-conia (YSZ) electrolyte layer on a porous La(Sr) MnOx cathode tube using the electrochemical vapor deposition method and then making a Ru/YSZ cermet anode on top of it. Solid-oxide-electrolyte fuel cells (SOFC) are anticipated for use in advanced co-generation systems and local power gen-eration system, because of their high power generation effi-ciency and high exhaust heat recovery temperature with little NOx emission. (1). Many companies have been developing SOFC; the most ad-vanced by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which is suc-cessfully operating a 20 kW cell module using tubular cells. They were also successful in continuously operating a single cell for over 20, 000 hours (2). The power density of these cells, however, was only 150 mW/cm 2, which is almost the same as phosphoric-acid fuel cells (PAFC).

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} corrosion {{behavior of}} mild steel in apple, grape, mango, orange and {{the mixture of}} these juices was investigated in this study. Open circuit potential and weight loss analytical techniques were employed to establish the comparative corrosion rates of this material in the agro media over the interval of five days for a sixty-day immersion period at an ambient temperature. The chemical compositions of both mild steel and the agro media were determined to ascertain corrosion mechanism for the <b>reaction.</b> <b>Polarization</b> behavior of mild steel in the agro media were determined by Tafel extrapolation curves. The analysis showed that cathodic polarization curves were almost identical irrespective of the concentration of the various media while the anodic polarization curves exhibited varying active and passive corrosion behaviour due to passivating oxide films. The analysis of the results further showed that the corrosion rate of the metallic sample decreased with longer immersion periods which {{could be attributed to}} a gradual decline in acidity of these media as revealed by the pH results. Hence, the evolution of hydrogen gas and reduction of dissolved oxygen molecules from the reacting system were presumed to be major factors retarding corrosion of the solution involved. Similarly, the presence of suspended particles {{on the surface of the}} test steel sample could have also led to the impediment to corrosion rates from the surrounding atmosphere. Microscopic analysis of the corroded mild steel specimens revealed uniform and localized corrosion with Fe 2 O 3 spotted as the main corrosion product. The result obtained from the electrochemical study showed that the corrosion rate of the mild steel sample was highest in the orange medium (1. 53 mm/yr), followed by grape medium (1. 40 mm/yr), mixture of these media (0. 67 mm/yr), mango medium (0. 40 mm/yr) while the metal corroded least in the apple medium (0. 30 mm/yr) over the duration of immersion.

Substantially quite another type of assembly afford nanostructured hyper-d-electronic-metals (Pt,Au,Ru), interactive grafted upon hypo-d-(f) -oxide supports, in particular of mixed and higher alter-valence values (W,Mo,Ta,Nb), well and for longer known in heterogeneous catalysis as SMSI (Strong Metal-Support Interaction, the ones of strongest in the entire chemistry).

The main accompanying achievements of substantial significance then have been: (i) Prevailing percentage in spontaneous adsorptive dissociation of molecular water upon hypo-d-(f) -oxide surfaces, or the corresponding latent storage and spillover of the yielding primary oxides (Pt−OH); (ii) Extra high stability MPs, (Plate type electrodes of MPs are straightforward employed in industrial chlorate cell production, and/or Li-batteries); (iii) Spontaneously adsorptive dissociated water molecules (or, hydroxide ions), then undergo membrane type ionic transfer all along hypo-d-(f) -oxide supports, until approaching catalytic metal surface, when the latter takes the prevailing amount of electron charge, and that way creates the primary oxide dipole species (Pt−OH); (iv) these undergo spillover by repulsion upon metallic, hypo-d-(f) -oxide and even over the suboxide MPs surfaces; (v) while the Magneli phases themselves feature a rather high n-type electron conductivity (up to and even above 1, 000 S/cm). The wetness impact factor and effect have been introduced as the lowest threshold level associated with the Pt−OH (Au−OH), bellow {{which there is no}} (electro) catalytic oxidation reaction taking place, such as the CO tolerance.
