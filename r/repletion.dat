5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine deficiency {{is the leading cause}} of preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, fine motor skills, and visual problem solving are improved by iodine <b>repletion</b> in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E
25|$|When athletes ingest both {{carbohydrate}} and caffeine following exhaustive exercise, their glycogen stores {{tend to be}} replenished more rapidly; {{however, the}} minimum dose of caffeine at {{which there is a}} clinically significant effect on glycogen <b>repletion</b> has not been established.|$|E
25|$|Frank Engel, a Member of the European Parliament and Honorary Consul of Armenia in Luxembourg, {{called for}} the {{recognition}} of Artsakh's independence, to avoid <b>repletion</b> of the Armenian Genocide. He accused Azerbaijan for aggression in Karabakh earlier in April, which showed that some people living on the Caspian Sea shore dream of a new genocide in Nagorno Karabakh.|$|E
25|$|Wagner {{wrote of}} his preoccupations with Schopenhauer and Tristan {{in a letter}} to Franz Liszt (December 16, 1854): Never in my life having enjoyed the true {{happiness}} of love I shall erect a memorial to this loveliest of all dreams in which, from the first to the last, love shall, for once, find utter <b>repletion.</b> I have devised in my mind a Tristan und Isolde, the simplest, yet most full-blooded musical conception imaginable, and with the ‘black flag’ that waves at the end I shall cover myself over – to die.|$|E
500|$|The {{second section}} begins to focus {{specifically}} on physiognomy, considering {{different parts of}} the body that index the [...] "character and faculties" [...] of individuals. Early chapters in this portion of the book are written in a medical style, and they detail signs in regards to [...] "temperate and healthy bod ... <b>repletion</b> of bad humours and excess of blood, cholera, phlegm, and melancholy", before turning to particular sections of the body. Several following chapters discuss dreams and their meanings. Scot argues that dreams are: true or false; signify the past, present, or future; or are entirely meaningless. The second section comes to an end with chapters concerning auguries and sneezes, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Cold (寒, [...] ) is {{generally}} characterized by aversion to cold, absence of thirst, {{and a white}} tongue fur. More detailed characterization depends on whether cold is coupled with vacuity or <b>repletion.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Heat (热, [...] ) is {{characterized}} by absence of aversion to cold, a red and painful throat, a dry tongue fur and a rapid and floating pulse, if it falls together with an exterior pattern. In all other cases, symptoms depend on whether heat is coupled with vacuity or <b>repletion.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Aggressive {{hydration}} {{at a rate}} of 5 to 10 mL/kg {{per hour}} of isotonic crystalloid solution (e.g., normal saline or lactated Ringer’s solution) to all patients with acute pancreatitis, unless cardiovascular, renal, or other related comorbid factors preclude aggressive fluid replacement. In patients with severe volume depletion that manifests as hypotension and tachycardia, [...] more rapid <b>repletion</b> with 20 mL/kg of intravenous fluid given over 30 minutes followed by 3 mL/kg/hour for 8 to 12 hours.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} chapter, Columbanus {{introduces}} the great principle of his Rule: obedience, absolute and unreserved. The words of seniors {{should always be}} obeyed, just as [...] "Christ obeyed the Father up to death for us." [...] One manifestation of this obedience was constant hard labour designed to subdue the flesh, exercise the will in daily self-denial, and set an example of industry in cultivation of the soil. The least deviation from the Rule entailed corporal punishment, or a severe form of fasting. In the second chapter, Columbanus instructs that the rule of silence be [...] "carefully observed", since it is written: [...] "But the nurture of righteousness is silence and peace". He also warns, [...] "Justly will they be damned who would not say just things when they could, but preferred to say with garrulous loquacity what is evil ..." [...] In the third chapter, Columbanus instructs, [...] "Let the monks' food be poor and taken in the evening, such as to avoid <b>repletion,</b> and their drink such as to avoid intoxication, so that it may both maintain life and not harm ..." [...] Columbanus continues: ...|$|E

60|$|The last bag of {{the knight}} lay thin and exhausted; the beggar {{clutched}} one bursting with <b>repletion.</b>|$|E
60|$|William Bannister made no more objections. He {{attacked}} {{his meal}} {{with an easy}} conscience, and {{about a quarter of}} an hour later leaned back with a deep sigh of <b>repletion.</b>|$|E
60|$|MRS WARREN. Well, I like {{enough to}} eat. But {{a little of}} that cold beef and cheese and lettuce goes a long way. [With a sigh of only half <b>repletion</b> she sits down lazily on the settle].|$|E
60|$|For {{several hundred}} yards the bellowing bull carried his two savage antagonists, until at last the blade found his heart, when with a final bellow that was half-scream he plunged headlong to the earth. Then Tarzan and Sheeta feasted to <b>repletion.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jack {{leaned back}} in his chair, and his eyes slowly closed. The food and wine had steeped him in a deep calm. The tense strain had been {{smoothed}} from his face. The languor of <b>repletion</b> was claiming him. Drowsily he spoke again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Both," [...] {{replied the}} young man, leaning {{back with a}} sigh of <b>repletion,</b> and wiping his mouth. [...] "I was {{released}} to-day, and, as I said, I shall be court-martialled again to-day fortnight. It'll be two years this time. But they can't break me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here you are," [...] cried Harry, {{holding out}} his hand and endeavouring to {{suppress}} his desire to laugh; [...] "up with you," [...] and in another moment the poor youth was upon his legs, with every fold and crevice about his person stuffed to <b>repletion</b> with snow.|$|E
6000|$|That over-feeding and under-feeding {{are both}} bad, is a truism. Of the two, however, the last is the worst. As writes a high authority, [...] "the effects of casual <b>repletion</b> are less prejudicial, and more easily corrected, {{than those of}} inanition."[1] Besides, {{where there has been}} no injudicious interference, <b>repletion</b> seldom occurs. [...] "Excess is the vice rather of adults than of the young, who are rarely either gourmands or epicures, unless through the fault of those who rear them."[2] This system of {{restriction}} which many parents think so necessary, is based upon inadequate observation, and erroneous reasoning. There is an over-legislation in the nursery, as well as an over-legislation in the State; {{and one of the most}} injurious forms of it is this limitation in the quantity of food.|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped for}} just a moment, {{and looked back at}} the fire with a fierce {{physical}} longing in his eyes, for all that was animal in him craved for food and the rest of <b>repletion.</b> Sewell, he saw, was lying half-asleep, with a partly consumed flapjack fallen from his hand.|$|E
60|$|She {{reached out}} her hand to Billy's and sighed with sheer <b>repletion</b> of content. It seemed she had never lived such a {{wonderful}} day. It was as if all old dreams were coming true. Such beauty of the world she had never guessed in her fondest imagining. Billy pressed her hand tenderly.|$|E
60|$|Certain {{possible}} inventions {{of which}} he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine <b>repletion</b> to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.|$|E
60|$|Apologising {{for this}} {{philological}} digression, we proceed. Besides Nuna and Nunaga {{there was a}} baby boy--a fat, oily, contented boy--without a name at that time, and without a particle of clothing of any sort, his proper condition of heat being maintained when out of doors chiefly by being carried between his mother's dress and her shoulders; also by being stuffed to <b>repletion</b> with blubber.|$|E
60|$|On {{entering}} his {{room at the}} hotel he found Rupert Filgee standing moodily by the window, while his brother Johnny, overcome by a <b>repletion</b> of excitement and collation, was asleep on the single arm-chair. Their presence was not unusual, as Mr. Ford, touched by the loneliness of these motherless boys, had often invited {{them to come to}} his rooms to look over his books and illustrated papers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Souchey," [...] said Lotta, {{when he had}} {{altogether}} done, and {{had turned}} his stool round to the kitchen fire, [...] "where do you think Nina would go {{if she were to}} marry--a Jew?" [...] There was an abrupt solemnity in the manner of the question which at first baffled the man, whose breath was heavy with the comfortable <b>repletion</b> which had been bestowed upon him.|$|E
60|$|On his {{departure}} the ape-man, with Abdul, wandered {{again into the}} streets of Sidi Aissa, where he was soon attracted by the wild din of sound coming from the open doorway {{of one of the}} numerous CAFES MAURES. It was after eight, and the dancing was in full swing as Tarzan entered. The room was filled to <b>repletion</b> with Arabs. All were smoking, and drinking their thick, hot coffee.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a rare}} {{pleasure}} {{to be in this}} company, to revel in their astonishing numbers, to feast my soul on them as it were--little birds in such multitudes that ten thousand Frenchmen and Italians might have gorged to <b>repletion</b> on their small succulent bodies--and to reflect that they were safe from persecution so long as they remained here in England. This is something for an Englishman to be proud of.|$|E
60|$|There were no {{vegetables}} at that feast, {{and instead}} of bread they had cakes of hard deer's-fat, with scraps of suet toasted brown intermixed-- a species of plum-cake, which was greatly relished by the visitors. At the last, when <b>repletion</b> seemed imminent, they finished off with marrow bones. With these they trifled far on into the night. Of course as the demands of appetite abated the flow of soul began.|$|E

60|$|Our pilgrims {{compress}} {{too much}} into one day. One can gorge sights to <b>repletion</b> as well as sweetmeats. Since we breakfasted, this morning, we have seen enough to have furnished us food for a year's reflection {{if we could have}} seen the various objects in comfort and looked upon them deliberately. We visited the pool of Hezekiah, where David saw Uriah's wife coming from the bath {{and fell in love with}} her.|$|E
60|$|The {{subject was}} not an easy one to broach to his {{somewhat}} forbidding friend, as he discovered when the latter arrived about half an hour later. Derek had been attending the semi-annual banquet of the Worshipful Dry-Salters Company down in the City, understudying one of the speakers, a leading member of Parliament, who had been unable to appear; and he was still in the grip of that feeling of degraded <b>repletion</b> which City dinners induce.|$|E
60|$|From Garberville, {{where we}} ate eel to <b>repletion</b> and got {{acquainted with the}} aborigines, we drove down the Eel River Valley for two days through the most unthinkably glorious body of redwood timber to be seen {{anywhere}} in California. From Dyerville on to Eureka, we caught glimpses of railroad construction and of great concrete bridges {{in the course of}} building, which advertised that at least Humboldt County was going to be linked {{to the rest of the}} world.|$|E
6000|$|TO D'ALEMBERT (a week later).... "What say you of Maupertuis dying between Two Capuchins! He was ill, {{this long}} while, of a <b>repletion</b> of pride; but I had not {{reckoned}} him either a hypocrite or an imbecile. I don't advise you ever {{to go and}} fill his place at Berlin; you would repent that. I am Astolpho warning Roger (Ruggiero) not to trust himself to the Enchantress Alcina; but Roger was unadvisable." [...] [Ib. lxxviii. 197 ("Delices, 25th August, 1759").] ...|$|E
6000|$|In the {{clump of}} trees {{referred}} to, Petawanaquat himself sat smoking over the dying embers {{of the fire}} that had cooked his recently devoured supper, and Tony, full to <b>repletion,</b> {{lay on his back}} gazing at him in quiet satisfaction, mingled slightly with wonder; for Tony was a philosopher in a small way, and familiarity with his father's pipe had failed to set at rest a question which perplexed his mind, namely, why men should draw smoke into their mouths merely to puff it out again! ...|$|E
60|$|Chance {{suggestions}} {{it was set}} {{the tune}} of his thoughts, and his state of health and <b>repletion</b> gave the colour. Yet somehow he had this at least almost clear in his mind, that to have gone to see Ann a second time, to have implied {{that she had been}} in possession of his thoughts through all this interval, and, above all, to have kissed her, was shabby and wrong. Only unhappily this much of lucidity had come now just a few hours after it was needed.|$|E
60|$|The clerk {{wrote the}} number of a room against Lemuel's name in the register, and then glanced at the bag. It was a large bag of oil- cloth, a kind of bag which is by nature lank and hollow, and must be made almost insupportably heavy before it shows any signs of <b>repletion.</b> The shirt and pair of {{everyday}} pantaloons which Lemuel had dropped that morning into its voracious maw made no apparent effect there, as the clerk held it up and twirled it on {{the crook of his}} thumb.|$|E
60|$|General Howe was {{in command}} of the Britishers, as we {{afterward}} learned, and he acted as if intending to take matters in the most leisurely way possible, for after all the troops had arrived and ascended the hill, huge tubs containing punch made from spirits, and baskets seemingly filled to <b>repletion</b> with food, were brought ashore from the barges, while we who were thirsty and hungry could look down upon those red-coated men as they were allowed to stretch themselves at ease upon the ground, eating and drinking at their pleasure.|$|E
