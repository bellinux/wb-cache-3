If the <b>phase</b> <b>encoding</b> order is linear with echo time, these modulations cause severe ghosting artifacts. Changing {{the order of}} <b>phase</b> <b>encoding</b> can greatly reduce these artifacts. Several <b>phase</b> <b>encoding</b> orders for T 2 -weighted sequences are compared in this paper, linear, partially randomized, standard GRASE ordering, and k-banded (kb) GRASE ordering. Different possible implementations of GRASE and kbGRASE are also considered. Computer simulation is used to compare resolution and artifact levels. Phantom and volunteer images are presented. The linear order is most sensitive to ghosting artifacts associated with chemical shift, susceptibility differences and static field inhomogeneities. The standard GRASE order is least sensitive to these but most vulnerable to artifacts associated with short T 2 signals, kb-GRASE is a good intermediate between linear and standard GRASE and generally shows the lowest artifact levels. The partially randomized order gives the most diffuse artifacts. Computer simulations show that spatial resolution and contrast with all <b>phase</b> <b>encoding</b> orders are similar...|$|R

A photon-counting technique is applied during the encryption process creating sparse images. The statistical {{distribution of the}} photon-counting decrypted data for full <b>phase</b> <b>encoding</b> and amplitude <b>phase</b> <b>encoding</b> are derived and their statistical parameters are used for authentication. The performance of the full phase PC-DRPE is compared with the amplitude-based PC-DRPE method.

These angiograms can be acquired with magnetization-prepared three-dimensional balanced steady-state free precession sequences, where the <b>phase</b> <b>encodes</b> are interleaved and the preparation is repeated prior to each interleave. However, frequent repetition of the preparation significantly decreases the scan efficiency. The number of excitations can instead be reduced with compressed sensing that exploits the sparsity of the angiograms.

40|$|Introduction Echo-planar imaging (EPI) is a {{group of}} fast data {{acquisition}} methods commonly used in fMRI studies. It acquires multiple image lines in k-space after a single excitation, which leads to a very short scan time. A well-known problem with EPI is that it is more sensitive to distortions due to the used encoding scheme. Source of distortion is inhomogeneity in the static B 0 field that causes more geometric distortion in <b>phase</b> <b>encoding</b> direction. This inhomogeneity is induced mainly by the magnetic susceptibility differences between various structures within the object placed inside the scanner, often at air-tissue or bone-tissue interfaces. Methods of reducing EPI distortion are mainly based on decreasing steps of the <b>phase</b> <b>encoding.</b> Reducing steps of <b>phase</b> <b>encoding</b> can be applied by reducing field of view, slice thickness, and/or the use of parallel acquisition technique. Materials and Methods We obtained three data acquisitions with different FOVs including: conventional low resolution, conventional high resolution, and zoomed high resolution EPIs.

Removing the gradient switching requirement during the application of RF pulses by a constant frequency encoding gradient can shorten experiment time for ultrafast imaging. However, having the gradient on during the pulses gives rise to echo shape variations from off-resonance effects, which make the image reconstruction difficult.

Misinterpreting a patient-motion- induced artifact as a system instability can cause unnecessary system downtime and expense while a field engineer searches for a non-existent system problem. Although the images may look the same, the original sampled data is different {{and can be used}} to determine the cause of the image artifacts. The process for segmentation is to detect the existing instabilities and bulk motion vectors within the sampled frequency-space complex data. Because the imaged object is real, the frequency-space sampled data is Hermitian and redundant information exists. The two halves of the data set are compared and statistics extracted. Vectors are created representing the instability types: magnitude, phase, and echo shift, in addition to frequency <b>encoding</b> and <b>phase</b> <b>encoding</b> bulk motion. Each element of the vector represents how the <b>phase</b> <b>encoding</b> view differed from the complex conjugate view.
