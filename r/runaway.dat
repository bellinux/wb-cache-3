5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} {{one way or}} another, <b>runaway</b> {{accretion}} begins. It is called <b>runaway</b> because the mass growth rate is proportional to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. It {{is obvious that the}} specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of larger bodies at the expense of smaller ones. The <b>runaway</b> accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|E
5|$|Carriage and {{shipment}} of {{some kinds of}} lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal <b>runaway.</b> Most consumer lithium batteries have built-in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident, or are otherwise designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal <b>runaway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{may suffer}} thermal <b>runaway</b> and cell rupture if overheated or overcharged, and {{in extreme cases}} {{this can lead to}} combustion. To reduce these risks, lithium-ion battery packs contain fail-safe circuitry that shuts down the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range. When handled improperly, or if manufactured defectively, some rechargeable batteries can experience thermal <b>runaway</b> resulting in overheating. Especially prone to thermal <b>runaway</b> are lithium-ion batteries. Reports of exploding cellphones have been reported in newspapers. In 2006, batteries from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions. Also, during the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's first year of service, at least four aircraft suffered from electrical system problems stemming from its lithium-ion batteries, resulting in the whole Dreamliner fleet being voluntarily grounded in January 2013.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. In early 2006, the Sacramento Police Department {{changed the}} focus of its Vice Unit's {{enforcement}} efforts from adult street prostitutes to juvenile prostitutes and pimps. The unit soon determined that {{a large percentage of}} the girls they arrested were <b>runaways,</b> particularly <b>runaways</b> from foster care. Current California law prohibits the secure detention of <b>runaways,</b> an unintentional consequence of which is recidivist <b>runaways.</b> This thesis is a case study of the Police Department's effort to combat and reduce female juvenile prostitution, an effort that produced surprising information about the number of <b>runaways</b> in Sacramento. To further frame the issue and provide comparison data, I analyzed national, state (California), and local (Sacramento) crime statistics involving <b>runaways</b> and female juvenile prostitution. Although <b>runaways</b> have decreased in the nation and in California, <b>runaways</b> in Sacramento have increased. Arrests for juvenile prostitution across America spiked in 2004, and have remained level since. California, leading the nation with over 50...|$|R

She also provided meals and shelter to <b>runaway</b> slaves in the Coffin home. Other aid was obtained from neighbors and others sympathetic to the cause, but were unwilling take the fugitives into their homes. Through these activities Coffin was able to secure a steady supply of goods to assist in the ongoing operations.|$|E
5|$|For {{his first}} foreign project, Kurosawa chose a story {{based on a}} Life {{magazine}} article. The Embassy Pictures action thriller, to be filmed in English and called simply <b>Runaway</b> Train, would have been his first in color. But the language barrier proved a major problem, and the English version of the screenplay was not even finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966. The shoot, which required snow, was moved to autumn 1967, then canceled in 1968. Almost twenty years later, another foreigner working in Hollywood, Andrei Konchalovsky, would finally make <b>Runaway</b> Train, though from a script totally different from Kurosawa's.|$|E

5|$|On {{the surface}} of the white dwarf, the accreted gas will become {{compressed}} and heated. At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a <b>runaway</b> reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface. This would result in a (recurrent) nova explosion—a cataclysmic variable star—and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly would increase by several magnitudes for a period of several days or months. An example of such a star system is RS Ophiuchi, a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion. RS Ophiuchi has flared into a (recurrent) nova on at least six occasions, each time accreting the critical mass of hydrogen needed to produce a <b>runaway</b> explosion.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} gas a super-Earth that formed in situ acquires {{may depend on}} when the {{planetary}} embryos merged due to giant impacts relative to the dissipation of the gas disk. If the mergers happen after the gas disk dissipates terrestrial planets can form, if in a transition disk a super-Earth with a gas envelope containing a few percent of its mass may form. If the mergers happen too early <b>runaway</b> gas accretion may occur leading {{to the formation of}} a gas giant. The mergers begin when the dynamical friction due to the gas disk becomes insufficient to prevent collisions, a process that will begin earlier in a higher metalicity disk. Alternatively gas accretion may be limited due to the envelopes not being in hydrostatic equilibrium, instead gas may flow through the envelope slowing its growth and delaying the onset of <b>runaway</b> gas accretion until the mass of the core reaches 15 Earth masses.|$|E
