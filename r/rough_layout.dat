50|$|Even {{though the}} theme of each short is {{virtually}} the same - cat chases mouse - Hanna and Barbera found endless variations on that theme. Barbera's storyboards and <b>rough</b> <b>layouts</b> and designs, combined with Hanna's timing, resulted in MGM's most popular and successful cartoon series. Thirteen entries in the Tom and Jerry series (including Puss Gets The Boot) were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons; seven of them {{went on to win}} the Academy Award, breaking the Disney studio's winning streak in that category. Tom and Jerry won more Academy Awards than any other character-based theatrical animated series.|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of Eurostar was supervised under the Bruch Engineering Office.

5000|$|Dodd {{was born}} in Hackney. During the Second World War {{he served in the}} Royal Air Force as a Servicing Commando, {{alongside}} Bill Herbert. After the war Dodd was demobilised and began to study art. He then found work in advertising and, after he won a competition to write a slogan for Time, Bill Herbert, by then the cartoon editor at The Daily Mirror, offered Dodd the chance to take over the writing of a comic strip he had created, The Perishers. Working with the artist Dennis Collins, Dodd provided <b>rough</b> <b>layouts,</b> which Collins then drew from.|$|R
5000|$|His work {{includes}} 23 paperback {{book cover}} paintings {{as well as}} frontispieces for Edgar Rice Burroughs and other fantasy writers published by Donald A. Wollheim at Ace Books. During the late 1960s, he created cover paintings for DAW Books and Lancer Books. When Lancer revived Robert E. Howard, creator of Conan the Barbarian, with revisions by L. Sprague de Camp, Krenkel was cited by cover artist Frazetta as a consultant. Krenkel also created preliminary roughs which Frazetta modified and used when he painted covers for Warren Publishing's Creepy and Eerie. Krenkel drew one-page [...] "Creepy's Loathsome Lore" [...] and [...] "Eerie's Monster Gallery" [...] stories as well as <b>rough</b> <b>layouts</b> and inks for [...] "H2O World" [...] with collaborator Al Williamson.|$|R
50|$|After a short {{stint as}} {{assistant}} to Dick Giordano {{in the early}} 1970s, Janson's first credited comics artwork was published by Marvel Comics in Jungle Action #6 (Sept. 1973). Janson came to prominence as the inker over Sal Buscema's pencils on The Defenders. Since then he has freelanced {{on most of the}} major titles at Marvel and DC. In 1975 he began a long run as inker on Daredevil, running from #124 (Aug. 1975) to #196 (July 1983). With #171 the series went from bi-monthly to monthly; unable to handle the increased workload, then-writer/penciler Frank Miller began increasingly relying on Janson for the artwork, sending him looser and looser pencils beginning with #173. By issue #185, Miller had virtually relinquished his role as Daredevil's artist, and was providing only <b>rough</b> <b>layouts</b> for Janson to pencil, ink, and color. After Miller's departure, Janson drew the series by himself for four issues.|$|R
50|$|Eurostar was {{a unique}} {{portable}} inverted roller coaster. From 1995 to 2008, it traveled on the fairground circuit in Germany. From 2008 until 2011 it was operating at Gorky Park, Moscow, in Russia. In 2011 it was closed and dismantled. It {{was the first and}} largest portable inverted roller coaster. Eurostar was the brain child of Oscar Bruch. Bruch had created and/or operated many portable coasters including, Alpina Bahn, Looping Star and Thriller. The Inverted coaster was becoming increasingly popular in the mid ‘90s, having been introduced to the theme park market by Bolliger & Mabillard. However, B&M were reluctant to attempt a travelling model, and so EuroStar was designed by Werner Stengel from a <b>rough</b> <b>layout</b> designed by Bruch. Aspects of the ride were built by many companies from across Europe (hence the name), under the directorship of the Swiss ride firm Intamin.|$|E
5000|$|An {{external}} wall is formed {{as the base}} with an internal wall acting as the foundation. Between the two walls, the area has been filled with two meters of rocks and earth, then paved on the top. The remaining space was left for a center statue to be placed. On the western outside wall, a masonry mass was left, forming the stairs. [...] From this <b>rough</b> <b>layout,</b> new lines were drawn in the paving in order to expand and build the temple properly. Angular rocks were used as the original blocks, set at an angle. The temple was neari lik pieon and larger rocks were to be placed last. Carving began {{from the top of}} the temple, working downward. The large finishing rocks that were to be used at the end were never carved or used, offering an explanation to their disappearance from the site.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the time}} Frazetta {{began working on}} the strip, the work of {{producing}} Li'l Abner {{was too much for}} one person. Capp had a group of assistants who he taught to reproduce his distinctive individual style, working under his direct supervision. Actual production of the strip began with a <b>rough</b> <b>layout</b> in pencil done by Al Capp, from Capp's script or a co-authored script, and the page would pass to Andy Amato and Walter Johnson. Amato would ink the figures, then Johnson added backgrounds and any mechanical objects. Harvey Curtis was responsible for the lettering and also shared inking duties with Amato ... In order {{to make sure that the}} work stayed true to his style, the final touches would be added by Capp himself. He enjoyed adding a distinctive glint to an eye or an idiosyncratic contortion to a character's face. The finished strip was truly an ensemble effort, a skillful blending of talents.|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, {{companies}} are creating product advertisements and catalog images using computer renderings of 3 D scenes. A common goal for these companies {{is to create}} aesthetically appealing compositions that highlight objects of interest {{within the context of}} a scene. Unfortunately, this goal is challenging, not only due to the need to balance the trade-off among aesthetic principles and design constraints, but also because of the huge search space induced by possible camera parameters, object placement, material choices, etc. Previous methods have investigated only optimization of camera parameters. In this paper, we develop a tool that starts from an initial scene description and a set of high-level constraints provided by a stylist and then automatically generates an optimized scene whose 2 D composition is improved. It does so by locally adjusting the 3 D object transformations, surface materials, and camera parameters. The value of this tool is demonstrated in a variety of applications motivated by product catalogs, including <b>rough</b> <b>layout</b> refinement, detail image creation, home planning, cultural customization, and text inlay placement. Results of a perceptual study indicate that our system produces images preferable for product advertisement compared to a more traditional camera-only optimization...|$|E

40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that shaded {{perspective}} view (“ 3 -D”) displays are better for understanding the shape and <b>rough</b> <b>layout</b> of terrain than conventional 2 -D views. We have coined the term Naïve Realism for users ’ misplaced, blanket faith in these 3 -D displays (Smallman & St. John, 2005). There are hints in the individual difference literature that those of low spatial ability may be particularly prone to Naïve Realism. Here, we integrate these notions to test several theoretical predictions {{and to develop a}} new terrain simplification concept. Thirty-three participants had their spatial ability and problem-solving style measured. Then participants predicted which displays would, and then did, best support them in performing a task of threading a concealed route through realistic terrain. Depth relief (shading vs. topographic lines), viewing angle (90 ° vs. 45 °) and terrain fidelity (high/unfiltered sharp vs. low/spatially smoothed) were all varied. Of the eight display combinations, Naïve Realism correctly predicted the greatest preference for the highest fidelity, realistic 3 -D view (sharp, shaded, 45 °). Yet the routing task was best performed with lower fidelity views. Spatially filtering terrain unmasks canyons and other gross terrain features, enabling them to pop-out more easily. Individuals of high spatial ability had better task performance and better calibrated their post-task display preferences, suggesting they are generally more savvy about the ways that display format affects their performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} of implementing EU quality and safety standards for food production and trading {{is one of}} the driving forces behind the restructuring of the agrofood chains in Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC). The progress made in the compliance process not only varies amongst sectors and countries, but also among particular chains due to differences in their internal structure and strategies, and features of their political and economic surroundings. We construct a models to identify determinants of the diffusion rate of standards in a food chain under pre-accession conditions. We argue that adoption decisions in the food chain are determined by farmers' and processors' economic considerations. Factors such as pricing behavior, compliance costs and market structure, all of which influence the adoption of standards, are identified and discussed in the paper. The findings are used to test an econometric model utilizing data on Polish milk processing firms in the period between 2000 and 2002. The results indicate that input and output prices have a significant influence on the diffusion rate of standards. The dominance of large-scale holdings in the relevant procurement market significantly increases, whereas high compliance costs decrease the diffusion. Small cooperatives were found to face significant problems in procuring high quality raw materials compared to their competitors.

40|$|AbstractFiber {{reinforced}} polymers (FRP) {{are used}} {{more and more}} in new construction structural components. Today already first transport infrastructures e. g. road and pedestrian bridges are built out of such components, using mainly manual and not automated manufacturing processes. In order to develop a cost-effective integrated construction process that will enable the maximum capability of automation of components for transport infrastructures using polymer based materials (carbon fiber, glass fiber, etc.) {{there is a need to}} industrialize the whole construction process of the FRP components. Hence the main objective is the conception and development of an automated off-site industrialization process for producing modular FRP-based transport infrastructure components. This overall process will cover the whole production process from the procurement of raw materials up to the transport of the produced components, including the facility layout and the management of involved human resources. This leads to the conceptual design of an off-site industrialization process for the most suitable highly flexible and agile production process at a high automation level as well as for coping different sizes and quantities of FRP components. Within this paper different planning activities for the conceptual design of the off-site industrialization process are presented and a detailed description of each planning phase and their associated planning activities is given. To define a conceptual design of the off-site industrialization process, the components that should be produced and the needed manufacturing processes are shortly presented. As a result of this for each component of the bridge, a generic production structure can be assigned and evaluated. Production areas, logistics as well as a <b>rough</b> <b>layout</b> for the factory have been analyzed and finally a variant for the possible final factory layout is presented...|$|E
