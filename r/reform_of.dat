Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold.|$|E

40|$|Pt {{catalysts}} {{supported on}} Al(2) O(3), activated carbon (AC), HUSY, and SiO(2) were prepared and characterized by N(2) physisorption, {{inductively coupled plasma}} atomic emission spectrometry, and H(2) chemisorption. The catalytic performance of these catalysts for H(2) production by aqueous-phase <b>reforming</b> (APR) <b>of</b> glycerol was studied. In addition, the <b>reforming</b> <b>of</b> different reactants such as polyols, glucose, and other soluble saccharides was also investigated. It {{was found that the}} activity of the supported Pt catalysts for the <b>reforming</b> <b>of</b> glycerol increased in the order Pt/AC < Pt/HUSY < Pt/SiO(2) < Pt/Al(2) O(3) at 503 K; however, the activity increased in another order Pt/SiO(2) < Pt/HUSY < Pt/AC < Pt/Al(2) O(3) at higher temperature (538 K). Pt catalysts supported on acidic supports such as Al(2) O(3) and HUSY tended to increase hydrocarbon formation. The H(2) selectivity and production rate for the <b>reforming</b> <b>of</b> polyols decreased with increasing carbon number. The H(2) selectivity and yield for the <b>reforming</b> <b>of</b> glucose decreased when the glucose concentration increased, while selectivity for hydrocarbon showed a maximum at glucose concentration of 4. 6 %, which was ascribed to the condensation and degradation reactions. Fructose is less readily reformed to H(2) than glucose. Higher H(2) Selectivity and yield were obtained by <b>reforming</b> <b>of</b> polysaccharide starch compared with those obtained by <b>reforming</b> <b>of</b> disaccharide maltose and monosaccharide glucose...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} reported that the dry <b>reforming</b> <b>of</b> methane can be enhanced by means of microwave heating. In this article, this technology {{is applied to the}} CO 2 <b>reforming</b> <b>of</b> coke oven gas (COG). The results obtained were opposite to those reported in the CO 2 <b>reforming</b> <b>of</b> CH 4, since {{in the case of the}} COG, microwave heating only slightly enhanced the conversions when an activated carbon was used as catalyst, whereas the results achieved when mixtures of activated carbon and Ni/Al  2 O 3 were employed as catalyst were even worse than those obtained in a conventional oven. Several hypotheses were considered in order to find an explanation for these poor results, the nature of the microplasmas formed during the process being the most likely factor. The high proportions of H 2 present in the reactor when the dry <b>reforming</b> <b>of</b> coke oven gas is carried out may give rise to microplasmas of higher temperature than in the dry <b>reforming</b> <b>of</b> CH 4. This will cause the Ni particles to sinter significantly, leading to a decrease in the conversions...|$|R

5|$|During the 1950s, efforts {{started to}} attempt <b>reform</b> <b>of</b> the law. Following the {{prosecution}} of several notable publishers, the Society of Authors formed a committee (with Norman St John-Stevas as legal advisor) to recommend <b>reform</b> <b>of</b> the existing law, submitting their proposals and a draft bill to the Home Office in February 1955. Instead of the wholesale reform the Society hoped for, the government instead chose limited reform through the Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act 1955 dealing with horror comics, which kept the Hicklin test but required that the work as a whole be examined. The Society and sympathetic Members of Parliament then attempted to introduce a Private Member's Bill, but this was quashed by the ensuing general election. Another Private Member's Bill was successfully introduced in March 1957 and sent to a committee. Composed of a mix of censors and reformers, the committee's recommendations were mixed, consisting of both conservative (further powers of search and seizure for the police) and liberal (the use of expert evidence attesting to the work's artistic merit) proposals.|$|E
