50|$|Fractional reserve banking has {{resulted}} in a transfer of wealth from the holders of currency to investors. Under fractional reserve banking the money supply is allowed to be increased whenever new interest-bearing loans are issued and is often constrained by a reserve ratio, which mandates that banks hold a portion of the wealth they lend out at interest in the form of real reserves. Many nations {{are in the process of}} eliminating <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is {{an analogy}} between thin {{provisioning}} in {{computers and the}} keeping of cash <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios</b> in banks. Much as all processes running on a computer whose memory is thinly provisioned may not simultaneously use {{the sum total of}} their allotments of memory because it does not all exist in the computer at one time; all depositors to a bank may generally not simultaneously close their accounts by taking cash withdrawals since their combined total usually exceeds the cash kept by the bank.|$|E
25|$|Another {{instrument}} of monetary policy adjustment {{employed by the}} Federal Reserve System is the fractional reserve requirement, {{also known as the}} required <b>reserve</b> <b>ratio.</b> The required <b>reserve</b> <b>ratio</b> sets the balance that the Federal Reserve System requires a depository institution to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks, which depository institutions trade in the federal funds market discussed above. The required <b>reserve</b> <b>ratio</b> is set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The reserve requirements have changed over time and some history of these changes is published by the Federal Reserve.|$|R
2500|$|To avoid {{defaulting}} on its obligations, {{the bank}} must maintain a minimal <b>reserve</b> <b>ratio</b> that it fixes in accordance with, notably, regulations and its liabilities. In practice {{this means that}} the bank sets a <b>reserve</b> <b>ratio</b> target and responds when the actual ratio falls below the target. Such response can be, for instance: ...|$|R
5000|$|The formula {{above is}} derived from the {{following}} procedure. Let the monetary base be normalized to unity. Define the legal <b>reserve</b> <b>ratio,</b> , the excess <b>reserves</b> <b>ratio,</b> , the currency drain ratio with respect to deposits, suppose the demand for funds is unlimited; then the theoretical superior limit for deposits is defined by the following series:.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{requirement}} sets the minimum reserves each bank must hold to demand deposits and banknotes. This type of regulation {{has lost the}} role it once had, as the emphasis has moved toward capital adequacy, and in many countries there is no minimum reserve ratio. The purpose of minimum <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios</b> is liquidity rather than safety. An example of {{a country with a}} contemporary minimum reserve ratio is Hong Kong, where banks are required to maintain 25% of their liabilities that are due on demand or within 1 month as qualifying liquefiable assets.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to this act, {{foreign banks}} {{operating}} in the US were subject to varying state laws with no uniformity. Thus {{for the benefit of}} both US regulators and foreign institutions seeking uniformity and stability, this act was approved. This act required foreign banks to apply for charters and approvals to operate within the United States from the Federal Reserve. Once approved, they next must meet the required <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios</b> with FDIC standards and is subject to US accounting and regulatory standards. This act allows foreign banks to establish branches within the United States that operate lawfully and under the same rules as domestic banks.|$|E

2500|$|The Bank of England, {{which is}} the central bank for the entire United Kingdom, {{previously}} held to a voluntary <b>reserve</b> <b>ratio</b> system, with no minimum reserve requirement set.

50|$|In the past, before bank {{reserves}} were greatly weakened, {{the banks}} made tremendous profits firstly by lending out bank notes at interest, {{and later by}} lending “deposits” both of which they had themselves created. But {{as time went on}} these bonanza profits on bank notes and demand deposits became smaller and smaller as the <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios</b> became weaker and weaker, and the banks’ ability to meet their demand liabilities became more and more precarious. Eventually, ruin ensued, both to business and banking not only because operating profits were less but even more because of the havoc played with the value of their capital assets. In the ten years from 1927 to 1937 more than ten thousand banks closed their doors, with enormous losses to the stockholders {{as well as to the}} depositors and the public in general.|$|E
5000|$|Within the United States, {{there were}} several {{contributing}} factors. In July 1832, President Andrew Jackson vetoed the bill to recharter the Second Bank of the United States (BUS), the nation's central bank and fiscal agent. As the BUS wound up its operations {{in the next four}} years, state-chartered banks in the West and South relaxed their lending standards, maintaining unsafe <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios.</b> Two domestic policies, in particular, exacerbated an already volatile situation. The Specie Circular of 1836 mandated that western lands could be purchased only with gold and silver coin. The circular was an executive order issued by Andrew Jackson, and favored by Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri and other hard-money advocates. The intent was to curb speculation in public lands, but the circular set off a real estate and commodity price crash as most buyers were unable to come up with sufficient hard money or [...] "specie" [...] (gold or silver coins) to pay for the land. Secondly, the Deposit and Distribution Act of 1836 placed federal revenues in various local banks (derisively termed [...] "pet banks") across the country. Many of these banks were located in western regions. The effect of these two policies was to transfer specie away from the nation's main commercial centers on the East Coast. With lower monetary reserves in their vaults, major banks and financial institutions on the East Coast had to scale back their loans, which was a major cause of the panic along with the real estate crash.|$|E
40|$|Using {{available}} {{annual data}} of 174 economies since 1957, {{we examine the}} similarities and differences of seven international <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios.</b> While individual international <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios</b> display substantial variations across economies, they are associated with an economy?s characteristics including geographic location, income level, stage of development, degree of indebtedness, and exchange rate regime. The association pattern varies across time and type of international <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios.</b> Interestingly, there is only limited evidence that Asian and non-Asian economies have significantly different international reserve hoarding behavior. Our results suggest that the inference about whether an economy is hoarding too many or too few international reserves depends on the choice of international reserve ratio. Further, different international <b>reserve</b> <b>ratios</b> exhibit different persistence profiles, but the evidence of dependence on structural characteristics is rather weak.
