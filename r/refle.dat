40|$|Abstract: The authors present 3 {{cases of}} {{asphyxia}} caused by atypical compression {{of the neck}} by the metal bed bars fitted {{at the sides of}} the bed to prevent falling out. These occurred in 3 elderly women living in nursing homes, confined to bed by severe neuro-psychiatric disturbances. In all 3 cases, the minor nature of the skin lesions and absence of blood infiltrations in the anatomic structures of the neck had made it difficult to diagnose the cause of death. Inspection of the rest homes, together with the autopsy findings (acute pulmonary emphysema, conjunctival petechiae, and dark, fluid blood), enabled identification of asphyxia as the cause of death and its causal agent as the bed bars.

5000|$|Although a {{side note}} to the {{mainstream}} of Norwegian literature, the literature which documents the experience of Norwegian emigrants to America {{is as important as}} the Norwegian immigrants became to the growing America of the 19th century. Three authors are recognized in this genre; Ole Rølvaag wrote about immigrants, while Johan Bojer and Ingeborg <b>Refling</b> Hagen wrote about emigrants. Ole E. Rølvaag, who immigrated to America, experienced life in the prairies, and rose to become professor of Norwegian at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, provided a strong record of the joys and pains of the immigrant in adapting to the harsh realities of and carving out a new life in a wild new country. Norwegian author Johan Bojer provided a mirror image, depicting the struggles and processes which led to the decisions to emigrate.

40|$|Brain {{death is}} the state of {{irreversible}} loss of brain func-tion due to organic brain lesions. Although there are minor variations among the criteria that are used to define brain death, the essential criteria for establishing brain death include complete unresponsiveness, permanent apnea, and an absence of brainstem reflexes (1). A variety of reflex movements have been reported in patients with brain death, such as plantar responses, muscle stretch reflexes, abdominal reflexes, and finger jerks (2). Because the aforementioned reflexes are spinal reflexes, the existence of such reflex movements does not preclude the diagnosis of brain death. While the occurrence of reflex movements in brain-dead patients is not uncommon in the literature, there have been no reports of reflex move-ments in brain-dead patients in Korea.

40|$|This paper reviews {{evidence}} that the fatty acid composition of dietary lipids influences the respiratory and cardiovascular physiology of Adriatic sturgeon (Acipenser naccarii) and, thereby, their tolerance of the stress of hypoxia. Sturgeon fed a commercial diet enriched in fish oil (menhaden oil as 15 % of dry feed weight), with an elevated content of highly unsaturated fatty acids of the ω 3 series (ω 3 HUFA), had a significantly lower standard metabolic rate (SMR) and routine oxygen consumption (Mo 2) than those fed a diet enriched with the same quantity of hydrogenated coconut oil, with an elevated content of saturated fatty acids (SFA). Both groups grew equally well. As {{a result of this}} difference in aerobic metabolism, sturgeon fed the ω 3 HUFA and SFA responded differently when exposed to hypoxic challenges, those fed ω 3 HUFA appearing more hypoxia-tolerant.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{laryngoscopy}} {{and the introduction}} of a bronchography tube on blood pressure, heart rate, rhythm and plasma catecholamines was studied in 30 patients during three different modes of anaesthesia induction (thiopentone 5 mg/kg followed by suxamethonium 1 mg/kg, propanidid 7 mg/kg followed by suxamethonium 0. 2 mg/kg and propanidid 10 mg/kg). Laryngoscopy and intubation caused an increase in systolic blood pressure in all groups, although the increase was not statistically signifi-cant after propanidid alone. Levels of total plasma catecholamines, measured during and two minutes after laryngoscopy, remained unchanged in all groups. The preanaes-thetic content of noradrenaline as a percentage of total catecholamines was higher in those patients who developed a more marked increase in blood pressure during laryngo-scopy and intubation. In man laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation cause tachycardia and arterial hypertension.

40|$|Unilateral cranial {{autonomic}} symptoms (UAs) such as lacrimation, conjunctival injection, eyelid oedema and nasal congestion, {{which are}} the hallmark of trigeminal autonomic cephalgias, may also occur in an as yet undetermined proportion of migraine patients. We studied 177 consecutive migraineurs to assess the frequency of UAs and the clinical characteristics of such patients. UAs were reported by 81 patients (45. 8 %), ocular symptoms alone or in combination with nasal symptoms being the most frequent. The headache was more severe (P< 0. 0002) and more strictly unilateral (P< 0. 0004) in patients who reported UAs than in those without. Thus, the presence of UAs suggests an activation of the trigeminal-autonomic reflex, probably related to an over-activation of the trigeminal afferent arm. These findings could have therapeutic implications, given the potential large-scale recruitment of peripheral neurovascular 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptors (the target of acute migraine treatment) in such patients. uMigraine, autonomic symptoms, trigeminal-autonomic <b>refle...</b>|$|E
40|$|There is {{a number}} of {{conditions}} in which rapid and shallow breathing occurs {{in spite of the}} absence of any recognised change in the chemical stimulus to the respiratory centre.

During some work on these conditions, we encountered complaints of respiratory disturbance dur-ing anaesthesia with trichlorethylene. This anaesthetic produces rapid and shallow breathing which is very readily reversible. We have therefore investi-gated the effects of trichlorethylene on the vagal afferent systems, and have compared them with those of other anaesthetics which do not usually cause conspicuous respiratory changes.
