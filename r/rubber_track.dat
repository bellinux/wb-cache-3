40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>rubber</b> <b>tracks</b> on tractors has allowed more engine power per unit weight than with steel-tracked tractors, {{together with a}} reduction in soil compaction and higher on-road speeds. Recently, triangular <b>rubber</b> <b>tracks</b> able to be adapted on conventional wheeled tractors have been introduced. In this context, {{the goal of the}} paper is to evaluate the performance of a tractor with four triangular <b>rubber</b> <b>tracks</b> with respect to those of a wheeled tractor; the comparative tests consist of ploughing under on low trafficable and workable soil. The results obtained have shown a higher tractive efficiency, lower soil compaction and up to 20 % lower specific fuel consumption for the fully tracked tractor. These results are in accordance with previous tests conducted with the triangular <b>rubber</b> <b>tracks</b> on highly trafficable soil, although in the present case, the dynamic traction ratio is markedly lower due to the low trafficable soil. The use of triangular <b>rubber</b> <b>tracks</b> is therefore justified on low trafficable soils and more in general on different soil conditions, since the soil is less compacted by such traction device...|$|R
