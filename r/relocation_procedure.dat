Usually the seismographic networks do not cover the boundaries of converging plates such as the Hellenic arc. The crustal thinning from the plate boundary towards the back-arc area creates significant errors in accurately locating the earthquake, especially when distant seismic phases {{are included in the}} analysis. The case of the Cephalonia (Ionian Sea, Greece) sequence of January–February 2014 provided an excellent example where the hypocentral precision was greatly affected by the crustal thinning from the plate boundary at the Ionian sea towards the Aegean sea.

However, when the sequence of reconfigurations to be performed is not predictable, the efficient management of the logic space available becomes the greatest challenge posed to these systems. Resource allocation decisions have to be made concurrently with system operation, taking into account function priorities and optimizing the space currently available. As a consequence of the unpredictability of this allocation procedure, the logic space becomes fragmented, with many small areas of free resources failing to satisfy most requests and so remaining unused.

40|$|We have {{determined}} precise hypocentral locations for over 3, 600 aftershocks {{that occurred in}} the Yuha Desert region following the 4 April 2010 M w 7. 2 El Mayor-Cucapah (EMC) earthquake until 14 June 2010 through a series of absolute and relative <b>relocation</b> <b>procedures</b> with algorithms including hpoinverse, velest and hypoDD. Location errors were reduced to ~ 20 m horizontally and ~ 80 m vertically. The locations reveal a complex pattern of faulting with en echelon fault segments trending in toward the northwest, approximately parallel to the North American-Pacific plate boundary and en echelon, conjugate features trending to the northeast. The relocated seismicity is highly correlated with the mapped faults showing triggered surface slip in response to the EMC mainshock. Aftershocks are located between depths of 2 km and 11 km, consistent with previous studies of seismogenic thickness in the region. Three-dimensional analysis reveals individual and intersecting fault planes between 5 km and 10 km in the along-strike and along-dip directions. These fault planes remain distinct structures at depth, indicative of conjugate faulting, and do not appear to coalesce onto a through-going fault segment. Measurements of surface displacement along the Laguna Salada-West and East (LS-W and LS-E, respectively) branches reveal no triggered surface creep on either branch following the EMC mainshock. Approximately 2 mm of triggered surface creep was observed on the LS-W in response to the 14 June 2010 M 5. 7 Ocotillo earthquake, however no creep was measured along the LS-E. Relocated seismicity shows that aftershock activity occurs along the LS-E, however not along the LS-W in the time period between these earthquakes. The area east of the LS-W was seismically active following the EMC mainshock, however; no systematic migration patterns were observed. Aftershock activity abruptly shuts off in this area following the Ocotillo earthquake. The majority of seismicity in the two-year period following the Ocotillo earthquake suggesting a complex spatial and temporal distribution of aftershock activity.

Hypocenter determination is significantly improved by using, in addition to regional and teleseismic P and S phases, the arrival times of PKiKP, PKPdf, and the teleseismic depth phases pP, pwP, and sP in the <b>relocation</b> <b>procedure.</b> A global probability model developed for later-arriving phases is used to independently identify the depth phases. The relocations are compared to hypocenters reported in the ISC and NEIC catalogs and by other sources.

In this study, the validity of using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in combination with a 3 D motion analysis system to relocate the TMS derived position was tested. In addition, the main goal was to quantify the advantage of using TMS to locate the optimal position in relation to the most commonly used EEG C 3 position. Markers were placed on the TMS coil and on the head of the subject. In eleven subjects, a TMS measurement was performed to determine the individual motor-evoked potential center-of-gravity (MEP-CoG). This procedure was repeated in nine subjects to test the validity. Subsequently, hemodynamic responses were measured at the MEP-CoG position and at the C 3 position during a thumb abduction and adduction task. On average, the MEP-CoG location was located 19. 2 mm away from the C 3 position. The reproducibility study on the MEP-CoG <b>relocation</b> <b>procedure</b> revealed no systematic relocations. No differences in early and delayed hemodynamic responses were found between the C 3 and MEP-CoG position.

40|$|In August 2000 and July 2001 two seismic sequences, {{characterized}} by mainshocks with Ml (local magnitude) respectively 5. 1 and 4. 8, {{occurred in the}} Monferrato region (Italy). The regional seismic network of North-western Italy (RSNI) recorded more than 250 foreshocks and aftershocks. The routine locations, obtained from the Hypoellipse code, show a seismic activity concentrated in a circular area, of a radius of about 15 km, located near Acqui Terme, and randomly distributed in depth. Location errors, due to an uneven azimuthal station distribution of the regional seismic network, prevent recognition of the geometry of the active zone. Waveform analysis revealed the presence of several multiplets. In order to discriminate and successively relocate them, an automatic cross-correlation procedure was applied. Normalized cross-correlation matrixes, for the RSNI stations which recorded almost 90 % of considered events, {{on the basis of}} a signal to noise ratio analysis, were computed using only S wave time windows. The use of a <b>relocation</b> <b>procedure,</b> based on the double-difference method which incorporates ordinary absolute travel-time measurements and/or cross-correlation differential travel-times, allowed us to overcome the constraints of the uneven distribution of stations giving a quite different frame of seismicity.

This orientation is confirmed by the analysis of the focal mechanisms: most focal solutions show a strike slip component with one of the nodal planes consistent with the main orientation of the seismic events...|$|E
40|$|The {{sequence}} of seismicity in the Dasht-e-Bayaz and Zirkuh region of northeastern Iran, which includes 11 destructive earthquakes within {{a period of}} only 30 years, forms {{one of the most}} outstanding examples of clustered large and intermediate-magnitude seismic activity in the world. We perform a multiple-event <b>relocation</b> analysis, with <b>procedures</b> to remove systematic location bias, of 169 earthquakes, most of which occurred in the period 1968 - 2008, to better image the distribution of seismicity within this highly active part of Iran. The geographic locations of the clustered earthquakes were calibrated by the inclusion of phase arrivals from seismic stations at short epicentral distances, and also by matching the relative locations of the three largest events in the study to their mapped surface ruptures. The two independent calibration methods provide similar results that increase our confidence in the accuracy of the distribution of relocated epicentres. These calibrated epicentres, combined with the mapping of faults from high-resolution satellite imagery, and from an InSAR-derived constraint on fault location in one case, allow us to associate individual events with specific faults, and even with specific segments of faults, to better understand the nature of the active tectonics in this region during the past four decades. Several previous assumptions about the seismicity in this region are confirmed: (1) that the 1968 August 30 Mw 7. 1 Dasht-e-Bayaz earthquake nucleated at a prominent segment boundary and left-step in the fault trace, (2) that the 1968 September 11 Mw 5. 6 aftershock occurred on the Dasht-e-Bayaz fault at the eastern end of the 1968 rupture and (3) that the 1976 November 7 Mw 6. 0 Qayen earthquake probably occurred on the E-W left-lateral Avash Fault. We show, in addition, that several significant events, including the 1968 September 1 and 4 (Mw 6. 3 and 5. 5) Ferdows earthquakes, the 1979 January 16 (Mw 6. 5) and 1997 June 25 (Mw 5. 9) Boznabad events and the 1979 December 7 (Mw 5. 9) Kalat-e-Shur earthquake are likely to have ruptured previously unknown faults. Our improved description of the faulting involved in the 1968 - 1997 earthquake sequence highlights the importance of rupturing of conjugate left- and right-lateral faults in closely spaced events, or potentially even within a single earthquake, as was likely the case at the eastern end of the 1979 November 27 (Mw 7. 1) Khuli-Buniabad main shock. The high level of clustered seismic activity probably results from the simultaneous activity on left- and right-lateral faults, an inherently unstable arrangement that must evolve rapidly. The combination of high-resolution satellite imagery and calibrated earthquake locations is a useful tool for investigating active tectonics, {{even in the absence of}} detailed field observations. © 2011 The Authors Geophysical Journal International © 2011 RAS...|$|R
40|$|In {{computational}} solid mechanics, the ALE formalism can be {{very useful}} {{to reduce the size}} of finite element models of continuous forming operations such as roll forming. The mesh of these ALE models is said to be quasi-Eulerian because the nodes remain almost fixed—or almost Eulerian—in the main process direction, although they are required to move in the orthogonal plane in order to follow the lateral displacements of the solid. This paper extensively presents a complete node <b>relocation</b> <b>procedure</b> dedicated to such ALE models. The discussion focusses on quadrangular and hexahedral meshes with local refinements. The main concern of this work is the preservation of the geometrical features and the shape of the free boundaries of the mesh. With this aim in view, each type of nodes (corner, edge, surface and volume) is treated sequentially with dedicated algorithms. A special care is given to highly curved 3 D surfaces for which a CPU-efficient smoothing technique is proposed. This new method relies on a spline surface reconstruction, on a very fast weighted Laplacian smoother with original weights and on a robust reprojection algorithm. The overall consistency of this mesh management procedure is finally demonstrated in two numerical applications. The first one is a 2 D ALE simulation of a drawbead, which provides similar results to an equivalent Lagrangian model yet is much faster. The second application is a 3 D industrial ALE model of a 16 -stand roll forming line. In this case, all attempts to perform the same simulation by using the Lagrangian formalism have been unsuccessful. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} "condensation" method that {{exploits}} {{the heterogeneity of}} the probability distribution functions (PDF) of event locations to improve the spatial information content of seismic catalogs. The method reduces the size of seismic catalogs while improving the access to the spatial information content of seismic catalogs. The PDFs of events are first ranked by decreasing location errors and then successively condensed onto better located and lower variance event PDFs. The obtained condensed catalog attributes different weights to each event, providing an optimal spatial representation {{with respect to the}} spatially varying location capability of the seismic network. Synthetic tests on fractal distributions perturbed with realistic location errors show that condensation improves spatial information content of the original catalog. Applied to Southern California seismicity, the new condensed catalog highlights major mapped fault traces and reveals possible additional structures while reducing the catalog length by ~ 25 %. The condensation method allows us to account for location error information within a point based spatial analysis. We demonstrate this by comparing the multifractal properties of the condensed catalog locations with those of the original catalog. We evidence different spatial scaling regimes characterized by distinct multifractal spectra and separated by transition scales. We interpret the upper scale as to agree with the thickness of the brittle crust, while the lower scale (2. 5 km) might depend on the <b>relocation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Accounting for these new results, the Epidemic Type Aftershock Model formulation suggests that, contrary to previous studies, large earthquakes dominate the earthquake triggering process. This implies that the limited capability of detecting small magnitude events cannot be used to argue that earthquakes are unpredictable in general. Comment: 35 pages, 11 figure...|$|E
