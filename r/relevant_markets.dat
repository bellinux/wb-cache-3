40|$|This thesis {{intends to}} analyze and clarify the <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> within air {{passenger}} transport. Further the thesis intends to investigate {{if there is any}} difference in air passenger transport in accordance to more general business. The definition of the <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> is an essential step in order to establish a breach under European competition law. The <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> includes the <b>relevant</b> product <b>market</b> and the <b>relevant</b> geographic <b>market.</b> The fundamental issue in the <b>relevant</b> product <b>market</b> is whether products are considered to be substitutable and can constitute the same market. The Commission has set a notice which includes methods and criterias and serves as guidelines to courts and companies to define the <b>relevant</b> <b>market.</b> The notice is however not binding for courts. The CJ have developed implementation of the criterias which it tends to refer to even if it is a different branch, however a case-by-case based definition is needed. The definition of the <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> is based on three main criterias: demand substitutability, supply substitutability and potential competition. Even though the supply substitutability seems not be implemented in a further extension in more general branches, it seems to be of greater importance when defining the <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> within air passenger transport. The air passenger transport has also established a test called base of origin and base of destination which includes an analysis of price, travel frequencies, comfort of the journey, transfer time to terminals and differences in the qualities and quantities in airports.   However according to air passenger transport, travel sequences seems to be the criteria that courts focus most on...|$|R

The change from sheep to cattle is reflected at Gracemere Homestead in adjustments to its layout , depicting the economic evolution of the region.

50|$|The {{notion of}} {{relevant}} market {{is used in}} order to identify the products and undertakings which are directly competing in a business. Therefore, the relevant market is the market where the competition takes place. The enforcement of the provisions of competition law would be not possible without referring to the market where competition takes place. The extent to which firms are able to increase their prices above normal competition levels depends on the possibility for consumers to buy substitute goods and the ability for other firms to supply those products. The fewer the substitute products and/or the more difficult it is for other firms to begin to supply those products, the less elastic the demand curve is and the more probable is to find higher prices. For all these reasons it is necessary to define the <b>relevant</b> <b>markets</b> for the different cases which fall under the Law.|$|E
5000|$|To be able {{to operate}} as a {{commercial}} business entity, the modern corporation requires a legal framework of regulation and oversight within which to exploit the <b>relevant</b> <b>markets</b> profitably. The infrastructure of law and commerce are provided {{by the government of}} each state in which the corporation desires to trade, and there is an inevitable linkage between the political and commercial interests. All states rely on businesses to provide an economic base consistent with each government's political policies. Without policies that are supportive of economic activity, businesses will not be profitable and so will not {{be able to}} provide the economic support that the state desires. In some cases, this symbiosis may lead to the commission of crimes. The research studies situations where, for various reasons, the oversight of corporate and/or state organisations by independent bodies has been manipulated or excluded, and either existing criminal activity is redefined as lawful, or criminal activity results but is not prosecuted.|$|E

40|$|The <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> in the U. S. {{sweetener}} complex was {{a subject}} of debate in the United States v.

Hence, they were both part of the so-called <b>relevant</b> <b>market.</b> We use cointegration analysis to show that over a large period of time, sugar prices and HFCS were positively correlated. However, focusing only on the time period 1997 through 2001, sugar and HFCS prices are not correlated. This lack of correlation in the later period implies that beginning in 1997, the <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> for HFCS does not include sugar. Thus questions are continuingly raised as to the competitiveness of the HFCS industry. ...|$|R
50|$|The Federal Trade Commission {{announced}} April 2008 that it {{issued a}} complaint challenging {{a series of}} acquisitions by TALX Corporation that substantially lessened competition in the markets for outsourced unemployment compensation management (UCM) and verification of income and employment (VOIE) services. The Commission and TALX have reached an agreement settling the Commission's challenge. “TALX acted illegally,” says Jeffrey Schmidt, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, “by acquiring virtually all of its competition {{in a series of}} transactions. While each transaction individually may not have been problematic, the FTC looked at the cumulative effect of the acquisitions. This case sends a message that firms can’t get away with unlawful acquisitions just because they take place in relatively small increments.” The complaint alleges that TALX's acquisitions have enhanced its ability to increase prices unilaterally and to decrease the quality of services in the <b>relevant</b> <b>markets.</b> In addition, the complaint notes, TALX has alliance partners, including Automated Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), Convergys, Inc., and Ceridian, Inc., which have agreements with TALX to outsource to TALX {{some or all of the}} UCM services they provide for their clients.|$|E
5000|$|This topic, {{especially}} as to {{if there is}} any difference between Articles 13 and 14, remained unclear until the Ruibang vs. J&J case that Shanghai High Court made a very interesting judgement on 1 August 2013 in which including an interesting analysis on the interrelations between AML Articles 13 and 14.
