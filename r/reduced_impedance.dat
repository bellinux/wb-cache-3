Generally, a semicircle located in high-frequency range represents the impedance due to a solid electrolyte interface, and a semicircle in relatively low-frequency range represents the charge-transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface [9, 30]. The size of the semicircle is dependent upon the impedance value of the cell. As shown in Fig.  6 b, the semicircles associated with the composites had smaller diameters than the semicircle corresponding to the pristine sample.
