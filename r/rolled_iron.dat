25|$|In 1863, {{development}} {{along the}} banks of Potrero Point consisted of two powder magazines on the southern side of the steep peninsula, located so as to keep dangerous commodities away from populated areas. Heavy industry first located on the point in 1866 when six wealthy San Francisco industrialists came together to organize the Pacific Rolling Mills with the plan to <b>roll</b> <b>iron</b> from scrap, in the hope of producing homegrown iron products, including railroad iron. Access to deep water was a necessity for delivering coal from Australia to fuel the mills, firebrick and clay from Liverpool and scrap iron from around the Pacific Rim and as far away as England.|$|R

40|$|Problem statement. Each scale level detectesthe new {{features}} {{of the structure of}} the material describing of it quality. For example, {{features of the}} grain structure are revealed in different kind of steel on microstruc ture level, and its parameters greatly influences on the strength properties of the metal. Thus, to select the scale of representation of a fractal object, for instance the elements of structure of <b>roll</b> <b>iron</b> or steel is necessary to determine the interval (1), where observed its self-similarity, and on this interval should be selected the scale, the use of which will allow him to choose adequate fractal dimension. For optimal scale structure of repose is taken one in which at least two adjacent points of the series (2), the fractal dimension is minimal differences between them. This is explained by the fact that this is best observed property of self-similarity structure. An example of the selection of the scale representation of the structure of cast <b>iron</b> <b>rolls</b> execution of SPHN (a) and execution SSHN (b) is shown on interval of increases in the range of x 100 to x 1000 with a predetermined pitch Δl = 100.

5000|$|In 1780, the Royal Navy's Victualling Commissioners {{agreed with}} Cort, {{who had taken}} over Attwick's business, to re <b>roll</b> <b>iron</b> hoops for their barrels.

Short of funds, he turned to Adam Jellicoe, at that time chief clerk in the pay branch of the Royal Navy, who agreed to finance Cort to the amount of nearly £30 000 on seemingly little security beyond the value of the business. It was the accepted practice for clerks in the Pay Office to temporarily use surplus funds for their own benefit. As part of the arrangement Jellicoe's son Adam became a partner in the Fontley Works.

50|$|For instance, two {{processes}} {{were used}} in constructing iron armor. In the first, hammering, large lumps of iron of scrap or puddled iron were heated to welding temperature and placed under heavy steel hammers. Repeated blows welded these lumps into one solid plate and shaped it to the required form and dimensions. Hammered iron plate was the armor used in the earliest ironclad vessels, including HMS Warrior. The second method, rolling, involved stacking iron lumps atop one another, heating them to welding temperature and passing them between two iron rollers to become one plate of the required size. <b>Rolled</b> <b>iron</b> was difficult to produce initially, as it required machinery of immense size and great power. However, when the Special Committee tested both types of plate in 1863, it found that <b>rolled</b> <b>iron</b> was superior to hammered due to greater uniformity in quality. The committee and iron manufacturers worked together on how to more easily produce rolled plate, which became standard use in warships beginning in 1865.|$|E
