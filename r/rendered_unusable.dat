5|$|<b>Rendered</b> <b>unusable</b> due to {{a bombing}} by the Italians on 5 July 1915, the ruins {{remained}} {{in a state of}} disrepair until the advent of the 21st century, when it was restored by the local administration of Ampezzo, {{with the assistance of the}} Lacedelli family. The fort houses a museum containing relics related to the First World War.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April 1941, during World War II {{the station}} was heavily damaged in an air raid. Much of the {{building}} was destroyed and the tracks to the station were <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable.</b> Although some funeral trains continued to run from nearby Waterloo station, the London terminus was never used again. Following {{the end of the}} war the London Necropolis Company decided that reopening the London Necropolis Railway was not financially worthwhile, and the surviving part of the station building was sold as office space. This remnant remains intact, and relatively unaltered since its opening.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, Parliament ordered the slighting of castles across the country, deliberately destroying or damaging the structures to prevent them being used in any subsequent Royalist uprisings. North Wales proved to be a special case, as there were concerns that Charles II might lead a Presbyterian uprising in Scotland and mount a sea-borne attack on the region. Conwy, Caernarfon and Beaumaris were initially garrisoned by Parliament to defend against such an attack. Conwy was later partially slighted in 1655, but Caernarfon and Beaumaris escaped entirely. Harlech, less of a potential Scottish target, was <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable</b> by Parliament, but was not totally demolished.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 16–17 April 1941, the London {{terminus}} was badly damaged in an air raid and <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable.</b> Although the LNC continued to operate occasional funeral services from Waterloo station to Brookwood railway station immediately north of the cemetery, the London Necropolis Railway was never used again. Soon {{after the end of}} the Second World War the surviving parts of the London station were sold as office space, and the rail tracks in the cemetery were removed. The part of the London building which housed the LNC's offices survives today. The two stations in the cemetery remained open as refreshment kiosks for some years afterwards but were subsequently demolished. The site of the northern station, serving the Nonconformist cemetery, is now heavily overgrown. The site of the southern, Anglican, station is now the location of a Russian Orthodox monastery and a shrine to King Edward the Martyr, which incorporate the surviving station platform and the former station chapels.|$|E
5|$|As Felice {{neared the}} coast, gale {{warnings}} were hoisted from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Galveston, while a hurricane watch extended from Morgan City to Port O'Connor, Texas. Small craft advisories were also posted, cautioning light vessels {{to remain in}} port. All coastal advisories were discontinued by {{the early hours of}} September 16. Residents {{in the path of the}} storm generally evacuated in a timely manner. Over 3,000 fled the storm in Cameron Parish, Louisiana; around half of the residents in the low-lying southern part of the parish had already left before the mandatory evacuation was ordered. Farther west, one of two evacuation routes out of Sabine Pass, Texas had been <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable</b> a few days before the storm when a bridge was damaged in a maritime accident. As the remaining highway was considered susceptible to coastal flooding, officials quickly worked to evacuate 1,300 people in Sabine Pass before the storm's approach. The American Red Cross converted nine public schools into temporary storm shelters in and around Beaumont. Shelters were also set up in Houston and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, though they went mostly unused. The post offices in Sabine Pass, Gilchrist, and Port Bolivar transferred money orders, first-class parcels and postage stamps to the Beaumont office as a safety precaution.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Before qualifying began on Saturday afternoon, Mercedes was forced to change the power unit in Nico Rosberg's car back to the one used in Belgium, which had already run for six full races, after finding an issue with the new specification unit. Meanwhile, Lotus was forced to borrow tyre blankets from other teams, as their own had been <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable</b> by rain during the night. When the session began, Nico Hülkenberg {{was one of the first}} out on track, but his fast lap was disrupted by Marcus Ericsson, who was later penalised for the incident. Both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen spent most of the session in the pit lane. While Ricciardo was able to get out and set a lap sufficient to see him proceed to the second part of qualifying (Q2), Verstappen went out only to see his engine cover blown off at Curva Grande, scattering the track with debris, though at the very end of the session, so no other cars were affected. Next to Verstappen, both Manor Marussia and McLaren drivers were eliminated.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} badly damaged in the First World War, when {{retreating}} Belgian troops <b>rendered</b> it <b>unusable</b> in October 1914, {{but it was}} restored by the Germans. However, in 1918 it was retreating German troops who <b>rendered</b> the bridge <b>unusable.</b> It was patched together in 1919, but was only restored sufficiently to permit a return to large-scale railway use in March 1924.|$|R
50|$|Email bombing is the {{intentional}} sending of {{large volumes of}} messages to a target address. The overloading of the target email address can <b>render</b> it <b>unusable</b> and can even cause the mail server to crash.|$|R
50|$|Although tidal cycles do {{not affect}} the south beach, storm surges {{occasionally}} flood the entire landing area {{to a depth of}} more than a foot, <b>rendering</b> it <b>unusable</b> for fixed-wing operations for weeks or even months at a time.|$|R
5|$|Although {{effects from}} Andrew were catastrophic, {{the extent of}} damage was limited mainly from Kendall to Key Largo due to the small wind field of the storm. The {{hurricane}} destroyed 90% of mobile homes in the county, including 99% of mobile homes in Homestead. At the Homestead Air Force Base, most of the 2,000buildings on the base were severely damaged or <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable.</b> Damage to the base was extensive enough that it was recommended for closure. Nearby, {{in the small town}} of Florida City, over 120homes were demolished and 700others were damaged, while a number of other buildings were damaged beyond repair, including City Hall. Further north, damage to poorly constructed homes in communities such as Country Walk and Saga Bay resembled that of an F3 tornado, as winds in the area were estimated to have ranged from , below the threshold for an F3 tornado. Four of the five condominiums at Naranja Lakes were destroyed. The Cutler Ridge Mall suffered severe wind and water damage; after the storm, significant looting was reported at that location. More than 50streets were blocked by fallen trees and power lines. Agriculture suffered extensively as well, with an 85% loss to fruit crops such as avocados, limes, and mangoes. Crop damage in Dade County totaled about $509million. The county suffered the vast majority of the damage from the hurricane, totaling approximately $25billion. Andrew left at least 40deaths in the county, 15direct and 25indirect.|$|E
5|$|The Charles Payne House is a -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage {{that has}} a spacious garden founded {{on the site of}} a long-removed house. The house's gable end faces the street with a rear ell and the other ell {{perpendicular}} to the main block on the west side. Centered on the east end of the roof is a cross gable which is visually offset by the dormer on the west. The house has a small gable-roofed vestibule on the east side, aligned underneath the cross-gable. The rear ell has an attached porch that spans its length. A single story bay hexagonal bay window protrudes from the facade. The distinguishing feature of the Payne house is the wood trim exterior, consisting of hood mould on the paired windows on the south, four kinds of bargeboards and bracketed cornices on the rear ell's east side. The interior of the Charles Payne House is not covered in detail by any survey, but has three mantelpieces on the first floor, two displaying Gothic Revival influence in their wooden designs and the third, located in the rear ell, made of grey marble with a round-head opening. Though not mentioned in the nomination, a photo shows one of the wooden mantlepieces filled with brick and <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable</b> at the time. The setting of the house was important to the National Register nomination, which specifically highlighted its shaded garden and fencing. At the time of the nomination, an ornamental round head picket fence surrounded the property and access was through a double-leaf lattice work gate. By 2013, the picket fence and entrance gate had been removed, but the property still retains the street frontage for its garden.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimated}} 90% of the 29,000 {{fishing boats}} in Miyagi, Iwate, and Fukushima prefectures were <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable</b> by the tsunami. Miyagi Prefecture's fishing industry was almost completely destroyed. Twelve thousand of 13,000 registered fishing {{boats in the}} prefecture were destroyed or damaged. At least 440 fishermen were killed or missing. The damage to the prefecture's fishing industry was estimated at ¥400 billion (US$5 billion). The total damage to Japan's fishing industry, in seven affected prefectures, was estimated at ¥1.26 trillion (US$11.29 billion).|$|E

25|$|Information {{security}} uses cryptography {{to transform}} usable information {{into a form}} that renders it unusable by anyone other than an authorized user; this process is called encryption. Information that has been encrypted (<b>rendered</b> <b>unusable)</b> can be transformed back into its original usable form by an authorized user, who possesses the cryptographic key, {{through the process of}} decryption. Cryptography is used in information security to protect information from unauthorized or accidental disclosure while the information is in transit (either electronically or physically) and while information is in storage.|$|E
25|$|Eleven {{hospitals}} suffered {{structural damage}} and were damaged or <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable.</b> Not only were they unable {{to serve their}} local neighborhoods, but they also had to transfer out their inpatient populations, which further increased the burden on nearby hospitals that were still operational. As a result, the state legislature passed a law requiring all hospitals in California {{to ensure that their}} acute care units and emergency rooms would be in earthquake-resistant buildings by January 1, 2005. Most were unable to meet this deadline and only managed to achieve compliance in 2008 or 2009.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the version}} 1.24 patch, many {{third-party}} {{programs have been}} <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable.</b> Several third-party programs that reveal the entire map, commonly known as maphacks, have been released for the update. It also disabled collided maps, which would make modified custom maps {{appear to be the}} same as the original. Another effect of the patch, which is not included in the release notes, is that custom maps with large filenames will not appear in the game. The limit is believed to be 20 characters, but this has not yet been tested. This patch also rendered many custom maps unplayable due to custom map scripts. Even some versions of the famous Defense of the Ancients were no longer functioning.|$|E

25|$|Greenland Dock {{suffered}} greatly during World War II, {{when many}} of the warehouses were razed by German bombing and the great lock was <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable</b> due to bomb damage. It soon recovered {{after the war and}} enjoyed a brief resurgence of prosperity. However, technological changes in the shipping industry soon pushed the dock into a spiral of decline. The deal porters' jobs were abolished from 1958 when timber started to be packaged. Not long afterwards, the shipping industry moved en masse to the system of containerization, which required bulk carriers far too large to be accommodated in the London docks. In 1970, the Surrey Commercial Docks were closed. Greenland Dock was sold to Southwark council.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus of}} much CF gene therapy {{research}} {{is aimed at}} trying to place a normal copy of the CFTR gene into affected cells. Transferring the normal CFTR gene into the affected epithelium cells {{would result in the}} production of functional CFTR protein in all target cells, without adverse reactions or an inflammation response. To prevent the lung manifestations of CF, only 5–10% the normal amount of CFTR gene expression is needed. Multiple approaches have been tested for gene transfer, such as liposomes and viral vectors in animal models and clinical trials. However, both methods were found to be relatively inefficient treatment options, mainly because very few cells take up the vector and express the gene, so the treatment has little effect. Additionally, problems have been noted in cDNA recombination, such that the gene introduced by the treatment is <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable.</b> There has been a functional repair in culture of CFTR by CRISPR/Cas9 in intestinal stem cell organoids of cystic fibrosis patients.|$|E
25|$|Luftwaffe Commander Baltic {{had been}} set up in April 1941, and brought {{together}} units under an ad hoc command system to disrupt Soviet sea traffic around Leningrad. The White Sea – Baltic Canal was <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable</b> for some time after a major lock was knocked out at Povenets on 15 July. From 22 June to 31 August, 1,775 sorties was flown against the canal; 737 by the 806th Coastal Air Group, 339 by JG 54 and eight by II./KG 1, and a number by small naval air squadrons. They sank 66,000 tons of shipping including five destroyers and another 17,000 tons of merchant shipping damaged, probably beyond saving. One heavy cruiser, 17 destroyers and 132,000 tons of merchant shipping was damaged for the loss of 11 Ju 88s and five Bf 109s. Three Arado Ar 95 and one Arado Ar 196 was lost. The VVS lost 46 aircraft in defensive operations. On 26 October, Leningrad had been completely surrounded, and there was little need to attack the canal passing through, since it was blocked by siege. Luftwaffe Command Baltic was disbanded on 26 October and some of its units sent to Fliegerkorps I.|$|E
50|$|A pier {{existed on}} the estate by the early 1870s. In 1873 it was {{replaced}} by a new 100 foot pier. By the end of 1911 the pier had undergone demolition although silting up of that area had <b>rendered</b> it <b>unusable</b> before that point.|$|R
50|$|With {{spectacular}} factors, it is {{the actual}} damage of the attack, meaning the attacks created direct losses and gained negative publicity.

500|$|In March 2017, the Jerome Historical Society {{acquired}} the former jail, {{now known as}} the Sliding Jail, from the Town of Jerome. <b>Rendered</b> <b>unusable</b> but not completely destroyed by earth movements since the 1930s, the jail is about [...] downhill from where it was originally built. The society plans to rehabilitate the jail, which has become a popular tourist attraction. The project, including improvements to a sliding parking area nearby, is expected to be completed later in 2017.|$|E
500|$|The battlecruiser , {{which was}} being {{converted}} to {{an aircraft carrier}} {{under the terms of}} the treaty, was wrecked in the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923 and <b>rendered</b> <b>unusable.</b> As a result, Kaga, which was originally slated to be scrapped {{under the terms of the}} Washington Naval Treaty (...) , was converted in Amagis stead. No work took place until 1925 as new plans were drafted and earthquake damage to the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal was repaired. Although the ship was commissioned on 31 March 1928, she did not join the Combined Fleet (Rengō Kantai) until 30 November 1929.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{there were}} rumors and {{unconfirmed}} reports that Pass-a-Grille (today a neighborhood of St. Pete Beach) was wiped out and that up to 150deaths occurred. Though the town was hit particularly hard, there were no fatalities and damage was less severe than indicated, reaching about $50,000. Storm surge was partially diverted to Boca Ciega Bay, but Pass-a-Grille generally suffered severe impact due to [...] of water covering some areas. The hotel was extensively damaged, while its dancing pavilion was destroyed. A number of cottages were badly damaged. The storm destroyed a casino in Gulfport. The casino in Indian Rocks Beach collapsed after the sand foundation was washed away.
