5|$|The {{species is}} found in central, southern, and western Tasmania and is absent from warmer, dryer areas. It grows on moist acidic soils in wet sclerophyll forest or subalpine scrub at altitudes of 600 to 1200m (2000–4000ft). It is an {{understory}} component of subalpine forest stands of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and alpine yellow gum (E. subcrenulata), as well as Athrotaxis selaginoides–Nothofagus gunnii short <b>rainforest,</b> Athrotaxis selaginoides <b>rainforest,</b> Leptospermum-with-rainforest scrub, the tall Nothofagus–Atherosperma <b>rainforest</b> and Nothofagus–Phyllocladus short <b>rainforest.</b> It is occasionally found in the Leptospermum scoparium–Acacia mucronata forest community of western Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{communities}} have been classified into nine categories: lowland subtropical <b>rainforest,</b> submontane <b>rainforest,</b> cloud-forest and scrub, lowland swamp forest, mangrove scrub and seagrass, coastal scrub and cliff vegetation, inland scrub and herbland, offshore island vegetation, shoreline and beach vegetation, and disturbed vegetation.|$|E

50|$|The snail {{used to be}} {{commonly}} found in <b>rainforests</b> and swampy parts of northern coastal lowlands and prefers palms and fig trees within <b>rainforests.</b> It also used to be found throughout coastal floodplain wetlands, coastal swamp forests, eastern riverine forests, littoral <b>rainforests,</b> northern warm temperate <b>rainforests,</b> and subtropical <b>rainforests.</b> The species is also found on the <b>rainforests</b> surrounding the Amazon river.|$|R
5|$|<b>Rainforests</b> {{are areas}} of the world with very high rainfall. Both {{tropical}} and temperate <b>rainforests</b> exist. Tropical <b>rainforests</b> occupy a large band of the planet mostly along the equator. Most temperate <b>rainforests</b> are located on mountainous west coasts between 45 and 55 degrees latitude, but they are often found in other areas.|$|R
50|$|Anodopetalum biglandulosum is a Tasmanian {{endemic species}} {{that is a}} common {{component}} of Tasmanian cool temperate <b>rainforests.</b> Tasmanian <b>rainforests</b> are classified along a fertility gradient into three major types: callidendrous, thamnic and implicate <b>rainforests.</b> Callidendrous <b>rainforests</b> are tall, park-like forests with few shrubs in the understory, located on high fertility soils. Thamnic <b>rainforests</b> are well-formed trees, medium in height, with a distinct shrub layer on intermediate fertility soils. Implicate <b>rainforests</b> are low, tangled forests with uneven canopies on infertile soils. Anodopetalum biglandulosum is typically an understory species in thamnic <b>rainforests,</b> {{as well as a}} canopy species in implicate <b>rainforests.</b> This species is present below 1100m altitude in high rainfall areas (in excess of 1750mm) and on poorly drained acid soils in Western and Southern Tasmania. In these locations, Anodopetalum biglandulosum forms a tangle of stems producing its characteristic ‘horizontal’ scrub growth.|$|R
5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} in the late 1960s used herbicides to defoliate a large section of the Amazon <b>rainforest</b> so that Alcoa could build the Tucuruí dam to power mining operations. Large areas of <b>rainforest</b> were destroyed, along with the homes and livelihoods of thousands of rural peasants and indigenous tribes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern is}} the risk of {{clearing}} rain forests and other environmentally valuable land for sugarcane production, such as the Amazon <b>rainforest,</b> the Pantanal or the Cerrado. Embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that 99.7% of sugarcane plantations are located at least 2,000km from the Amazon, and expansion during the last 25 years {{took place in the}} Center-South region, also far away from the Amazon <b>rainforest,</b> the Pantanal or the Atlantic forest. In São Paulo state growth took place in abandoned pasture lands. The impact assessment commissioned by the Dutch government supported this argument.|$|E
5|$|At {{the global}} scale {{and in the}} {{broadest}} sense environmental management involves the oceans, freshwater systems, land and atmosphere, but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical <b>rainforest</b> to a home garden.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rainforests</b> are forests {{characterized}} by high rainfall, with annual rainfall {{in the case}} of tropical <b>rainforests</b> between 250 and 450 cm, and definitions varying by region for temperate <b>rainforests.</b> The monsoon trough, alternatively known as the intertropical convergence zone, plays a significant role in creating the climatic conditions necessary for the Earth's tropical <b>rainforests.</b>|$|R
50|$|In nature, {{tropical}} <b>rainforests</b> {{are considered}} the world's medicine chest or world's largest pharmacy as 25% of Western pharmaceuticals are derived from ingredients found in tropical <b>rainforests.</b> Additionally, more than 2,000 plants from the tropical <b>rainforests</b> {{have been identified as}} having anti-cancer properties with 70% of those are found only in <b>rainforests.</b> There are additional potential to this medicine chest. Currently, only less than 1% of all species in <b>rainforests</b> have been analysed for their medicinal value.|$|R

5|$|Bee-eaters {{are fairly}} {{indiscriminate}} in {{their choice of}} habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed <b>rainforest</b> where it forages {{close to the ground}} in poor light in the gaps between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with <b>rainforest,</b> but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.|$|E
5|$|Euryoryzomys emmonsae, {{also known}} as Emmons's Rice Rat or Emmons's oryzomys, is a rodent from the Amazon <b>rainforest</b> of Brazil in the genus Euryoryzomys of the family Cricetidae. Initially misidentified as E.macconnelli or E.nitidus, it was {{formally}} described in 1998. A <b>rainforest</b> species, it may be scansorial, climbing but also spending time on the ground. It occurs only in a limited area south of the Amazon River {{in the state of}} Pará, a distribution that is apparently unique among the muroid rodents of the region.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are found}} in the west, north, and east of Madagascar, but their {{distribution}} is discontinuous. Their habitat ranges from dry deciduous forests on the western coast of the island to <b>rainforest</b> in the east. They are also commonly found in secondary forest, but not in areas lacking continuous forest cover. They are most common in the west of the island. Fork-marked lemurs are not found in the southern spiny forests in the dry southern part of the island, and only recently have been reported from the southeastern <b>rainforest</b> at Andohahela National Park, though this has not been confirmed. A team led by E.E.Louis Jr. has suggested that undescribed varieties may also exist elsewhere on the island.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe lowland <b>rainforests</b> of Meghalaya, India {{represent}} the westernmost {{limit of the}} <b>rainforests</b> north of the Tropic of Cancer. These forests, on the Shillong plateau, are akin to Whitmore's ‘tropical lowland evergreen rainforest’ formation and exhibit striking similarities and conspicuous differences with the equatorial <b>rainforests</b> in Asia-Pacific as well as tropical seasonal <b>rainforests</b> in southwestern China near the Tropic of Cancer. We found these common attributes of the <b>rainforests</b> in Meghalaya: familial composition with predominance of Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, Meliaceae, Moraceae, Myrsiticaceae, Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae; deciduousness in evergreen physiognomy; dominance of mega- and mesophanerophytic life-forms; abundance of species with low frequency of occurrence (rare and aggregated species); low proportional abundance of the abundant species; and truncated lognormal abundance distribution. The levels of stand density and stand basal area were comparable with seasonal <b>rainforests</b> in southwestern China, but were lower than equatorial <b>rainforests.</b> Tropical Asian species predominated flora, commanding 95 % of the abundance. The differences include overall low stature (height) of the forest, inconspicuous stratification in canopy, fewer species and individuals of liana, thicker understory, higher proportion of rare species, absence of locally endemic species and relatively greater dominance of Fagaceae and Theaceae. The richness of species per hectare (S) was considerably lower at higher latitudes in Meghalaya than in equatorial <b>rainforests,</b> but was comparable with seasonal <b>rainforests.</b> Shannon's diversity index (H′ =  4. 40  nats for ≥ 10  cm gbh and 4. 25  nats for ≥ 30  cm gbh) was lower on higher latitudes in Meghalaya in comparison to species-rich equatorial <b>rainforests,</b> {{but it was the}} highest among all lowland <b>rainforests</b> near the Tropic of Cancer...|$|R

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2008, Nina Rønsted and colleagues analysed the DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers, and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase region, in the first molecular analysis of the section Malvanthera. They found F.rubiginosa to be most closely related to the <b>rainforest</b> species F.watkinsiana and two rock-growing (lithophytic) species of arid northern Australia (F.atricha and F.brachypoda). They classified these species in a new series Rubiginosae in the subsection Platypodeae. Relationships are unclear and it is uncertain into which direction the group radiated (into <b>rainforest</b> or into arid Australia).|$|E

5|$|While the golden-crowned sifaka faces few {{biological}} threats, such as predation, {{it faces}} many significant human-caused (anthropogenic) threats. Its habitat has been highly fragmented, with forest patches isolated by severely degraded grasslands. By 1985 {{it was estimated}} that 34% of the entire eastern <b>rainforest</b> of the island had disappeared, and by extrapolation it is predicted that at this rate of deforestation there will be no eastern <b>rainforest</b> left by 2020. Illegal logging practices, slash-and-burn agriculture (known as tavy), uncontrolled grass fires, gold mining, poaching, and clearing land for agricultural use have all significantly contributed to the significant deforestation witnessed in Madagascar and the ongoing decline of suitable habitat for this species.|$|E

The sudden collapse of the vital <b>rainforest</b> ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which {{was a part of}} one of the top two most devastating plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a self-reinforcing and very rapid change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although much new work is being done to better understand the fine-grained historical climate changes in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E
