40|$|Despite its {{selective}} nature, the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> {{is one of}} themost effective {{sources of}} the state budget revenues. A fundamental influence on the receipts from this source is exercised by: the kinds and number of articles recognized as excisable and the volume of their sales {{in the country and}} of their imports, the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates, the extent of granted allowances and exemptions, as well as the efficiency in collecting the revenues from this duty. The range of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> applicability is very large and covers a great number of articles, many of them of no significant fiscal importance. At the same time, the list of allowances and exemptions introduced both by acts of Parliament or by ordinances of government bodies is excessively extended. The bulk of revenues obtained from the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> comes from taxation of alcoholic beverages, tobacco articles and fuels, while the source of greatest importance is the duty on domestic sales of goods that, in 1994 - 2001, provided on average 87. 7 % of the total <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> revenues. The taxation of imports played a much smaller role. The rates of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> burden are relatively high and since the start of their functioning have been many times modified. However, in recent years a trend towards stabilizing the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates, and even towards reducing some of them, can be observed. Excessive <b>excise</b> rate <b>duties</b> led <b>to</b> deterioration in the condition of the spirits, wine and tobacco branches. Financial difficulties of some firms, especially those producing alcoholic beverages, led to accumulation of arrears in the discharge of their <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> liabilities and <b>to</b> remission of a part of their indebtedness on that score. The <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> is a flexible source of budget revenues and it is the Minister of Finance who plays the role of the main author of the state's policy in this area. He has broad powers in shaping the rates and introducing the allowances and exemptions and, consequently, in shaping the revenues from the <b>excise</b> <b>duty.</b> The excessive authority of the Minister of Finance and the use of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> as a source of additional revenue whenever the budget is in critical situation is often subject for criticism. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{distributional effects}} of revenue-neutral tax reforms {{aimed at improving}} dietary quality and encouraging healthier grain consumption. Using data on household grain purchases, we analyse both the impact on dietary quality and the tax incidence among income groups of VAT reforms and <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> reforms. The VAT reforms include subsidies of healthy products (products labelled with the Swedish National Food Administration’s healthy symbol) funded by increased VAT on ‘less healthy’ products. The <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> reforms contain a subsidy of fibre content, funded by <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> on either added sugar or saturated fat. Our {{results suggest that the}} VAT reforms have a similar impact on dietary quality across all income groups, with increases in fibre intake, but also unwanted increases in the intake of nutrients frequently overconsumed: fat, salt and sugar. The impact on dietary quality of the VAT reforms is therefore difficult to evaluate. With the exception of the lowest income group, the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> reforms seem <b>to</b> have a positive health effect across all other income groups, with increases in the intake of fibre and reductions in the intake of saturated fat, sugar and added sugar. For the lowest income group we find the highest increase in the intake of fibre, but generally an increase in the intake of the other nutrients, too. The <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> reforms also result in a more energy dense grain diet, with increases in the intake of calories for all income groups. Both the VAT reforms and the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> reforms appear <b>to</b> be progressive. The lowest income group pays less food taxes and generally faces a lower overall post-reform price level. The income group that increases its tax payments most is the one with the highest income. This is also the income group that faces the largest increase in the overall post-reform price level. food; health; taxation; income groups; incidence; consumer economics...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the fuels that are taxed, the forms that the taxes take and, where possible, quantifies the amounts collected. There are various {{estimates of the}} value of government subsidies to fossil fuels in Australia. These estimates range from around $ 8 billion to $ 12 billion annually. Fossil fuels are also taxed. The Australian Government taxes a variety of fossil fuels. They include crude oil and condensate, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, ethane, compressed natural gas, and ‘refined’ petroleum products such as petrol and diesel. Taxes that the Australian Government imposes can be classified as income (direct) or indirect. Direct taxes take the forms of <b>excise</b> <b>duties,</b> customs duties, and the goods and services tax (GST). <b>Excise</b> <b>duties</b> apply <b>to</b> petrol, diesel, ‘other’ fuel products (such as aviation fuels), and crude oil and condensate. Credits for excise paid are available to some users of fossil fuels—notably the mining, agriculture and transport sectors—under the Fuel Tax Credits Scheme. Customs <b>duty</b> applies <b>to</b> imports of ‘excise-like’ fuels, for example, petrol and diesel. The GST applies to households’ consumption of energy—such as electricity and natural gas—and other goods and services that embody fossil fuels in their prices. The Australian Government also imposes a number of ‘indirect’ taxes on the profits of fossil fuel producers such as coal and petroleum extraction companies.

40|$|This {{discussion}} paper analyses the value chain for sorghum beer in Kenya, from growing Gadam sorghum {{to the production}} and retailing of Senator Keg. The business model developed by Smart Logistics Solutions Ltd. was used to analyze social inclusion in the value chain. A stratified random sample of 300 members and non-members of Smart Logistics groups in eastern Kenya was sampled in the main growing season for sorghum in 2012 - 2013. Based on interviews with major actors, the Value Links methodology was used to map the value chain and quantify value addition {{at different stages of}} the value chain. Analysis of value addition showed that growers received 4 % of the retail price of sorghum beer, Smart Logistics 1 %, EABL 81 %, Senator keg distributors 5 % and Senator keg retailers 9 %. No information was available on intermediate costs or value added for sorghum brewing. Profitability for Smart Logistics depended on volume while, following the imposition of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> in 2013, profitability for retailers was negative. The average member of a Smart Logistics group planted 1. 71 acres to sorghum and harvested 483 kg per household of which 305 kg (63 %) was sold. Shortage of land, shortage of labour, and low profitability were reported as the most important constraints on sorghum production. Bird-scaring and threshing were the two most important labour constraints. Ninety percent of group members sold their sorghum to Smart Logistics. The main complaint by members was the time spent waiting for payment. The average time waiting for payment was 4. 5 weeks. Only 5 % of growers were paid within the 1 -week target set by Smart Logistics. On average, members selling to a Smart Logistics collection centre in 2012 sold 342 kg of sorghum at a price of 25 KES/kg, earning KES 8, 550 from sorghum sales. Most income from sorghum was invested in children’s education. Members of Smart Logistics groups spent an average of KES 32, 000 on education per year, of which KES 18, 000 went on university education. Income from sorghum (KES 8, 550) was equivalent to one quarter of annual investment in education. A significantly higher share (83 %) of the members of Smart Logistics groups reported an improvement in their economic position since 2009 compared to non-members (70 %). Members of Smart Logistics groups {{were significantly more likely to}} be headed by women, have high dependency ratios, and own less land per adult family member. Membership was not significantly related to income per head. The main reason given by non-members for not joining a Smart Logistics group was that they did not have time to attend group meetings and meetings at demonstration plots. The price of sorghum beer depends on the level of <b>excise</b> <b>duty.</b> From 2004 Senator Keg enjoyed zero <b>excise</b> <b>duty,</b> making it competitive with illegal brews. As a result, Senator Keg became EABL’s best-selling beer by volume. However, a sharp rise in public expenditure and domestic debt has increased the need for government to raise tax revenues. Following imposition of a 50 % <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> in 2013, sales of Senator keg have fallen by an estimated 80 %. In the long-term, the future of sorghum beer in Kenya depends on growth in income per head. In the short term, it depends on lower <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> make it more affordable for low-income consumers...|$|R
