5|$|Amylostereum is {{the single}} genus in the fungal family Amylostereaceae. The genus {{currently}} comprises four saprotrophic and parasitic species, which live off living or dead wood. The Amylostereaceae cause white <b>rot</b> <b>in</b> the wood by disintegrating the tissue component lignin. They produce crust-like, partially wavy fruit bodies {{on the surface of}} infested trees, which are similar to those produced by Stereum species.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, Hygrophoropsis is a {{widespread}} genus, found in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is the most widely distributed species, found on several continents. The other species are not well-known and have more limited ranges. Fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, and peat, and on woodchips. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus, and causes brown <b>rot</b> <b>in</b> the wood it colonises. Some species may be facultatively mycorrhizal.|$|E

5|$|Planted bulbs are {{susceptible}} to nematodes, the most serious of which is Ditylenchus dipsaci (Narcissus eelworm), {{the main cause of}} basal plate disease in which the leaves turn yellow and become misshapen. Infested bulbs have to be destroyed; where infestation is heavy avoiding planting further narcissi for another five years. Other nematodes include Aphelenchoides subtenuis, which penetrates the roots causing basal plate disease and Pratylenchus penetrans (lesion nematode) the main cause of root <b>rot</b> <b>in</b> narcissi.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America where it grows on large (at least 1m diameter) {{specimens}} of noble fir (Abies procera), Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), or western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Bridgeoporus nobilissimus causes a brown <b>rot</b> <b>in</b> its tree hosts. Genetic analysis shows that the fungus is more prevalent than fruit body distribution indicates.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Hapalopilus nidulans {{causes a}} white <b>rot</b> <b>in</b> its host. Fruit {{bodies of the}} fungus grow singly, in groups, or in fused and overlapping clusters on the wood of dead and decaying deciduous trees. Preferred hosts include Quercus (oak), Fagus (beech), and Betula (birch), although on rare occasions it has been recorded on conifer wood as well. In central Europe, its preferred host is oak, while in northern Europe it is found most commonly on Corylus and Sorbus. Fruiting typically occurs from early summer to autumn, but the tough fruit bodies are persistent and may be encountered out of the usual growing season.|$|E
40|$|Three on-orchard {{treatments}} to reduce postharvest rots of avocados were evaluated on two orchards, one organic orchard in the Bay of Plenty {{and the other}} conventional orchard in Whangarei. The treatments were applied in a split plot factorial design. Calcium {{was applied to the}} soil under trees for one treatment, dead branches were removed from the canopy and the lower branches were trimmed to a height of 1 m for the second treatment, and trees were irrigated and treated with phosphorous acid for the third treatment. Mulch was applied instead of phosphorous acid in the organic orchard to improve root health. Irrigation in combination with controlling root rots by injecting with phosphorous acid reduced both body rots and stem-end <b>rots</b> <b>in</b> fruit from the Whangarei orchard, but irrigation in combination with application of mulch did not reduce <b>rots</b> <b>in</b> fruit from the Bay of Plenty orchard. The application of calcium to trees reduced body <b>rots</b> <b>in</b> fruit from both orchards. The removal of dead wood from the canopy reduced <b>rots</b> <b>in</b> fruit from the Bay of Plenty orchard, but not in fruit from the Whangarei orchard...|$|R

5|$|Armillaria is a genus of fungi {{commonly}} known as honey mushrooms. First treated by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821, and later assigned generic rank by Friedrich Staude in 1857, Armillaria is classified in the Physalacriaceae family of the Agaricales, the gilled mushrooms. The majority of species in Armillaria are saprotrophic and live mainly on dead wood, but some are parasites that can cause root and butt <b>rot</b> <b>in</b> over 600 species of woody plants. Some Armillaria species form mycorrhizae with orchids; others, such as A.gallica, A.mellea, and A.tabescens, are bioluminescent.|$|E
5|$|French cuisine varies {{according}} to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them <b>rot</b> <b>in</b> the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate {{the success of the}} hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|There are 16 {{accepted}} {{species of}} Hygrophoropsis, found {{in both the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus that causes brown <b>rot</b> <b>in</b> the wood it colonises. The fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, peat, and on woodchips. They are convex to infundibuliform (funnel-shaped) and have decurrent, forked brightly colored gills. The spores are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. Because H.aurantiaca has orange gills, it has been mistaken for a chanterelle, and hence it has been called a false chanterelle.|$|E

5|$|Sam {{died while}} him, Nathan and their {{associate}} Rafe Adler attempted {{to find the}} whereabouts of Henry Avery's Gunsway haul in a Panamanian prison. Nathan and Rafe escaped, while Sam is shot 'dead'. In reality, he was imprisoned once again after his wounds were tended to,a distraught Nate did attempt to find him, still thinking he was alive but was lead {{to believe that he}} was dead by the guards who wanted Sam to <b>rot</b> <b>in</b> prison as revenge for them indirectly killing a guard. 15 years later, he tracks down a retired Nathan and convinces him to pick up where they left off in the search for the Gunsway haul by feeding Nathan a false breakout story. The story involves Hector Alcazar, who broke Sam free and demands half of the treasure of the Gunsway. These events kick off the main story of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. It is later revealed that Rafe bribed the prison to release Sam, and that Sam double crossed Rafe to resume the search with Nathan.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{evidence}} has shown Cabernet Sauvignon {{is the result}} of the crossing of two other Bordeaux grape varieties— Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc— which has led grapevine historians, or ampelographers, to believe that the grape originated in Bordeaux. Early records indicate that the grape was a popular planting in the Médoc region during the 18th century. The loose berry clusters and thick skins of the grape provided a good resistance to <b>rot</b> <b>in</b> the sometimes wet maritime climate of Bordeaux. The grape continued to grow in popularity until the Powdery mildew epidemic of 1852 exposed Cabernet Sauvignon's sensitivity to that grape disease. With vineyards severely ravaged or lost, many Bordeaux wine growers turned to Merlot, increasing its plantings to where it soon became the most widely planted grape in Bordeaux. As the region's winemakers started to better understand the area's terroir and how the different grape varieties performed in different region, Cabernet Sauvignon increased in plantings all along the Left Bank region of the Gironde river in the Médoc as well as Graves region, where it became the dominant variety in the wine blends. In the Right bank regions of Saint-Émilion and Pomerol, Cabernet is a distant third in plantings behind Merlot & Cabernet franc.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the spread of Armillaria root <b>rot</b> <b>in</b> {{eucalypt}} forests is associated with infected stumps that remain after an area has been logged. Armillaria luteobubalina can persist on these stumps, using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years. In one case reported in Ovens, Victoria, the disease was spread to blueberry plants (Vaccinium species) via buried fragments of infected Eucalyptus that remained following preparation of the previously forested site for planting. In individual forest stands, fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees—a discontinuous distribution. Large-scale aerial photography can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species. The species also causes damage to trees and bushes in coastal dune woodlands, shrubland, and heath communities. It can be found on a wide range of hosts, but is most commonly associated with (in order of decreasing frequency) jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), bull banksia (Banksia grandis), marri (E.calophylla), Lasiopetalum floribundum, and Acacia saligna. It has also infected scattered populations of wandoo (E. wandoo). The fungus has also been reported to infect Nothofagus species in Argentina, and Pinus radiata in Chile.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{research}} in Hunter Valley vineyards {{discovered that a}} wide range of pathogens caused various occurrences of bunch <b>rot</b> <b>in</b> the vineyards. These other pathogens included Colletotrichum acutatum (ripe rot), Greeneria uvicola (bitter rot) and other fungi from the genera of Aspergillus, Penicillium and Alternaria. Susceptibility of certain wine grape varieties were found to increase as the grapes reached higher Brix sugar levels. Further research in the 2000s, showed that some of the open canopy techniques used to prevent Botrytis grey rot may actually promote the development of some of these other types of rot. Ripe <b>rot,</b> <b>in</b> particular, seemed to thrive at the higher ultraviolet B (280–320nm) light exposure that open canopies allow. To compound the potential problem for Hunter Valley wine growers is that, as of 2010, there wasn't any fungicides registered for use for this disease.|$|E
