5|$|Development began {{soon after}} the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The game {{introduced}} a shift to a more realistic and detailed style and tone for the series. Unlike previous entries, Grand Theft Auto IV had no strong cinematic influence, as the team attempted an original approach to the story. As part of their <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team.|$|E
5|$|During 1936 the {{experimental}} system at Bawdsey was tested against {{a variety of}} simulated attacks, along with extensive development of interception theory carried out at RAF Biggin Hill. One observer was Hugh Dowding, initially {{as the director of}} <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> RAF, and later as the commander of RAF Fighter Command. Dowding noted that the CH stations provided so much information that operators had problems relaying it to the pilots, and the pilots had problems understanding it. He addressed this through the creation of what is today known as the Dowding system.|$|E

5|$|In Quicksilver, Stephenson {{places the}} {{ancestors}} of the Cryptonomicons characters in Enlightenment Europe alongside a cast of historical individuals from Restoration England and the Enlightenment. Amongst the cast {{are some of the}} most prominent natural philosophers, mathematicians and scientists (Newton and Leibniz), and politicians (William of Orange and Nassau) of the age. In an interview, Stephenson explained he deliberately depicted both the historical and fictional characters as authentic representatives of historical classes of people, such as the Vagabonds as personified by Jack, and the Barbary slaves as personified by Eliza. In his <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> characters, he explored the major scholarship about the period.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} gather <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> series, Hoshino once visited New York as she {{believes}} the city left a deep influence in her works. She also visited graveyards since she never had resources for the series. The ground zero of the World Trade Center after the September 11 attacks also left a big impression in her based on the guides' comments. Hoshino commented she would rather go again as {{she did not have}} much time to stay in New York.|$|E
5|$|Sleeping Dogs {{difficult}} and prolonged development began in 2008. The game {{was announced in}} 2009 {{as part of the}} True Crime series but was canceled by Activision Blizzard in 2011, {{as a result of the}} project's delays and budget issues. Six months later, Square Enix bought the publishing rights and renamed the game Sleeping Dogs, without the True Crime license, but considered a spiritual successor. During development, United Front staff visited Hong Kong to conduct field <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> visual environments and sound.|$|E

5|$|The game is Barlow's first project {{since his}} {{departure}} from Climax Studios, {{after which he}} became independent. He wanted to develop a game that was dependent on the narrative, and avoided working on the game until he was settled on an idea that was possible to execute. Barlow eventually decided to create a police procedural game, and incorporate live action footage. He conducted <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game by watching existing police interviews. Upon doing so, he discovered recurring themes in the suspects' answers, and decided to incorporate ambiguity to the investigation in the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} in {{development}} for four years, and {{was created to}} combine elements from video games and documentaries with an engaging narrative. Game director Navid Khonsari, who was a child in Iran {{at the time of}} the Revolution, developed the game with the intention of making players understand the moral ambiguity of the situation. The development team conducted extensive <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game, interviewing historical scholars and Iranians who lived in Tehran during the Revolution, as well as gathering numerous archival photos and historical speeches. The game's performances were recorded using motion capture, and each of the characters was developed with ambiguous attitudes and morals.|$|E
5|$|Upon the submarine's {{return to}} Kure, Hashimoto was {{detached}} and {{assigned to the}} advanced course at Submarine School on 1 February 1942, to prepare him for command of a submarine. Graduating from this course on 30 June, Hashimoto was given command of submarine Ro-31, a coastal defense vessel. For the remainder of 1942, Hashimoto operated his ship in home waters off Yokosuka training crews and trying new equipment and doing <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of Japanese submarine doctrine. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 November. In 1943, he was given command of submarine I-158 for coastal defense, {{and later in the}} year was given command of submarine Ro-44 for the same duties.|$|E
5|$|After {{her first}} year of {{graduate}} school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in Raymond Pearl's laboratory, where she worked with rats and Drosophila, to earn money for tuition. After false starts with pit vipers and squirrels, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the pronephros in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson {{was forced to leave}} Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family. In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled Romance Under the Waters. The series of fifty-two seven minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and {{in the work of the}} bureau—a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay, based on her <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> series, to local newspapers and magazines.|$|E

5|$|Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American {{scientist}} and cytogeneticist who {{was awarded the}} 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader {{in the development of}} maize cytogenetics, the focus of her <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of her life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized {{among the best in the}} field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} to Biologist in June 2001, British teacher and Chartered Biologist Paul Spiring speculated that Merrick might have {{suffered}} {{from a combination of}} the two syndromes. This hypothesis was reported by Robert Matthews, a correspondent for The Sunday Telegraph. The possibility that Merrick had both conditions formed the basis for a 2003 documentary film entitled The Curse of The Elephant Man that was produced for the Discovery Health Channel by Natural History New Zealand. During 2002, genealogical <b>research</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film led to a BBC appeal to trace Merrick's maternal family line. In response to the appeal, a Leicester resident named Pat Selby was discovered to be the granddaughter of Merrick's uncle George Potterton. A research team took DNA samples from Selby in an unsuccessful attempt to diagnose Merrick's condition. During 2003, the filmmakers commissioned further diagnostic tests using DNA that was extracted from Merrick's hair and bone. However, the results of these tests proved inconclusive; therefore, the precise cause of Merrick's medical condition remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Legacy Parkway {{is part of}} {{the larger}} Legacy Highway project first {{proposed}} by then-governor Mike Leavitt, which ultimately will run north from Nephi toward Brigham City. The concept of a western Davis County highway has existed since the 1960s, with some proposals routing the highway over Antelope Island or across Farmington Bay. Legacy Parkway was to extend to {{the west side of the}} Salt Lake City International Airport and connect to I-80 at 5600West; however, that plan was abandoned in October 1997. A survey taken by Valley <b>Research</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Salt Lake Tribune in December 1997 showed 64percent of Davis County residents were in support of building the parkway, with just 19percent opposing the construction. State officials had hoped to have the parkway open in time for the 2002 Winter Olympics being held in Salt Lake City; however, construction was delayed too many times for that to occur.|$|E
