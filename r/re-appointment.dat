5|$|In late 1980 Matlock {{had been}} {{appointed}} Ambassador to Czechoslovakia by President Jimmy Carter. However, the appointment was not ratified by the Senate before Carter’s election loss, {{and so it was}} with Ronald Reagan’s <b>re-appointment</b> in 1981 that he became Ambassador to Czechoslovakia. During his tenure, he was able to help resolve a major impediment to good relations: the return of 18.4 tons of gold that had been looted by the Nazis in World War II and kept, ever since its recovery by Allied forces, in American and British banks.|$|E
5|$|Mufarrij {{also tried}} to win support among the Christians, and {{possibly}} curry the favour of the Byzantine Empire as well, by sponsoring works to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which had only recently been demolished on the orders of al-Hakim, and by arranging the <b>re-appointment</b> of a Patriarch to the vacant see. In general, the Jarrahids {{seem to have had}} close relations with the Christians and maintained contact with Byzantium, a fact which would play a role in later events.|$|E
5|$|Alberta Chief Returning Officer Lorne Gibson, {{as one of}} his 182 post-election {{recommendations}} to the government, suggested that the appointment of returning officers be handled by his own, non-partisan, office. He had previously made this suggestion in 2006, but the government had not acted on it. He also recommended following the election that his office, rather than the government's Justice department, be responsible for prosecuting election-related offenses; the latter did not lay charges in any of 19 alleged campaign finance violations Gibson brought to its attention. In February 2009, Gibson appeared before the legislature's all-party committee on legislative offices to answer questions about the conduct of the election; there, he echoed opposition claims that the government, and not his office, was to blame for most problems. Shortly after, the committee voted 8–3 against re-appointing him, with all Progressive Conservatives on the committee opposing his <b>re-appointment</b> and all opposition MLAs supporting it. Opposition leaders David Swann and Brian Mason suggested that Gibson was being punished for criticizing the government.|$|E

5|$|Walker {{accepted}} a <b>re-appointment</b> as {{the superintendent of}} the 1880 Census because a new law, spearheaded by Congressman James A. Garfield, had been passed {{to allow him to}} appoint trained census enumerators free from political influence. Notably, the 1880 Census's results suggested population throughout the Southern states had increased improbably over Walker's 1870 census but an investigation revealed that the latter had been inaccurately enumerated. Walker publicized the discrepancy even as it effectively discredited the accuracy his 1870 work. The tenth Census resulted in the publication of twenty-two volumes, was popularly regarded as the best census of any up to that time, and definitively established Walker's reputation as the preeminent statistician in the nation. The Census was again delayed {{as a result of its}} size and was the subject of praise and criticism on its comprehensiveness and relevance. Walker also used the position as a bully pulpit to advocate for the creation of a permanent Census Bureau to not only ensure that professional statisticians could be trained and retained but that the information could be better popularized and disseminated. Following Garfield's 1880 election, there was wide speculation that he would name Walker to be Secretary of the Interior, but Walker had accepted the offer to become President of MIT in the spring of 1881 instead.|$|E

5000|$|Musso's {{return was}} a turning point of FDR's {{political}} journey. During the party conference on August 26 and 27, 1948, they adopted a new political line. They established a new body that consisted of left-wing parties. Members of this new political bureau were FDR leaders (Maruto Darusman, Tan Ling Djie, Harjono, Setiadjit, Djoko Sujono, Aidit, Wikana, Suripno, Amir Sjarifuddin, and Alimin) with Musso serving as the chairman. These <b>re-appointments</b> were made legitimate grounds by FDR/PKI's enemies to launch [...] "anti-PKI campaign". The government prepared some strategies to [...] "eliminate the Communists". One of the government's biggest accusations was that Musso promoted [...] "the Republic's involvement in a Soviet-American conflict". The unification of these political forces was a fatal mistake.|$|R

5000|$|After {{receiving}} the Jǔrén degree in 1708 and his Jìnshì degree in 1709, Akdun became successively a bachelor from 1709-12, a compiler from 1712-15, an expositor from 1715-16, and a reader from 1716-17 in the Hanlin Academy. In 1717 {{he was sent}} as head of a mission to Korea, with <b>re-appointments</b> in 1722 and 1724. His impressive appearance and his dignified bearing lead to him being well received {{on all of these}} occasions [...] From 1718 to 1726 he served other posts, as sub-chancellor of the Grand Secretariat from 1718-22,as junior vice-president of the Board of War from 1722-23, chancellor of the Hanlin Academy from 1722-25, as senior vice-president of the Board of Ceremonies in 1726 and on the Board of War in 1726. When Kong Yuxun (孔毓珣) was summoned for an audience with the emperor in 1726, Akdun was sent to take his place as acting governor-general of Guangdong and Guangxi, and in addition was made Tartar General of Canton. In the following year he was transferred to the post of acting governor of Guangdong, and later in the same year to that of Guangxi. Unfortunately he did not get on well with his colleagues, and in 1728 as the result of charges brought against him by Kong Yuxun and Yang Wenqian (楊文乾), he was deprived of his office and titles.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Sewall (December 17, 1921 - November 23, 2011) was an American {{politician}} and businessperson. He served four terms as President of the Maine Senate (1975-1982), {{which made him}} {{at that time the}} longest serving Senate President in Maine history. Sewall was born in Old Town, Maine, son of James Wingate Sewall and Louise Gray Sewall in the home that his great grandfather and Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, George P. Sewall, built between 1830 and 1851. His maternal grandfather, George Gray, founded Old Town Canoe Co. He attended local schools, Holderness School, and Bowdoin College, A.B. 1941, Doctor of Civil Law, Honoris Causa, 1983. After graduation (accelerated) from college he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1943 during World War II as an aerial navigator, specializing in celestial navigation. Shortly {{after the end of the}} War, and after his father's death in 1946, he became President of James W. Sewall Company in Old Town, an international consulting forestry and engineering firm. He later was elected to the Old Town City Council and then to the Maine State Senate in 1967. Sewall served as President of the Maine Senate from 1975 to 1982. He was succeeded in the Maine Senate in 1982 by Democrat Michael Pearson. [...] Upon leaving the legislature, Sewall was appointed to the Board of Trustees of Maine Maritime Academy by Governor Joseph Brennan. Soon after his appointment, he was elected Chairman, a post he held for 20 years. He was also appointed by President George H.W. Bush to be a U.S. Commissioner of the Roosevelt Campobello International Park Joint Commission and a Member of the *Commission on Merchant Marine and Defense by President Ronald Reagan and <b>re-appointments</b> by President George H.W. Bush. He was a Trustee of Eastern Maine Medical Center, and a Director of Merchants National Bank, its successor, Merrill Merchants Bank, then its successor, People's United Bank (Bangor District), all of Bangor. Sewall was a moderate Republican.|$|R
25|$|He became {{increasingly}} involved in Democratic politics, and chaired the Labor Bureau of the Democratic National Committee in 1932, 1936, 1940, and 1944. His <b>re-appointment</b> in 1936 by DNC chair James A. Farley deeply upset {{the leadership of}} the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), who felt Tobin an uninspired campaigner and strategist. In response, the CIO formed Labor's Non-Partisan League to fully and completely mobilize labor support for Roosevelt. But despite the division in the American labor movement, by 1944 Tobin was working closely with the CIO PAC.|$|E
25|$|In 1936 Greene {{was granted}} a one-year furlough, {{followed}} by a <b>re-appointment</b> in Changsha by the Yale-in-China Association. Phillips and Ruth Greene spent this year raising American awareness of the social, political, and religious climate of China. The Greenes returned to Changsha {{at the height of}} the Sino-Japanese War. The family barely avoided being in Shanghai when it was bombed by the Japanese on August 12, 1937. Once Greene arrived in Changsha, bombing victims were sent to him for treatment from Liling and other cities on the battle front.|$|E
25|$|In 1981 he made {{a return}} to {{politics}} and was appointed by the then Taoiseach FitzGerald as Minister for Foreign Affairs in the short-lived Fine Gael led government. The appointment was suggested by FitzGerald's wife who believed only Dooge could stop him frequently interfering in this area. When a new coalition Government was formed in 1982 (which would last until 1987) Dooge declined <b>re-appointment</b> to the post owing to the decline of his sight. Between 1982 and 1987 Dooge returned to Seanad Éireann. He rejected the offer of becoming a European Commissioner offered by FitzGerald.|$|E
25|$|Heinz Hopf, who {{had been}} in Berlin before his {{appointment}} to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held - as is clear from oral statements and also from letters - Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya {{on the occasion of the}} <b>re-appointment</b> of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. - If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him.|$|E
25|$|Phokas {{visited the}} capital and celebrated his {{scheduled}} triumph in April 963, but then accused Bringas of plotting against him, and sought refuge in Hagia Sophia. There, he gained {{the support of the}} Patriarch of Constantinople, Polyeuctus, and with his aid he secured a <b>re-appointment</b> as Domestic of the Schools (commander in chief) of the East, despite Bringas's objections. Bringas now turned to Marianos Argyros, the commander-in-chief of the West, and offered him the Byzantine throne. At the same time, he wrote to the strategos of the Anatolics John Tzimiskes, Phokas's nephew and most important general, offering his uncle's post if he would turn against him. Instead, Tzimiskes revealed the letter to Phokas and urged him to action. Phokas's troops proclaimed him Byzantine emperor on July 2, 963, and set out for Constantinople. In the capital, Bringas brought in troops, seized all ships to prevent a crossing of the Bosporus by the rebels, and even took Nikephoros's father, the aged Bardas Phokas, as a hostage. The populace of the city, however, supported the rebellion, and as the rebel army approached, rose up against Bringas's troops, supported by the patriarch and Basil Lekapenos, who reportedly armed 3,000 of his retainers and sent them out to fight.|$|E
25|$|During the 2005–06 season, Henry {{featured}} 33 {{times for}} the Hertfordshire club, as the club narrowly missed out on a play-off position. In the same season, he was made captain by Westley in the side's 2–0 win over Exeter City. The following season, Henry played a total of 45 games under new manager Mark Stimson, and despite losing his captaincy {{in the early part}} of the season to Luke Oliver, Henry continued playing well and consequently regained his role as team captain later that season. During this season, Henry started the campaign in an unfamiliar central midfield role, but reverted to full-back following Stevenage's bad start to the season. In April 2007, Henry scored his first ever league goal for Stevenage, in a 2–1 home defeat against Kidderminster Harriers, hitting the ball on the half-volley from the edge of the area. In May 2007, Henry became the first ever player to lift a cup at the new Wembley Stadium; after Stevenage beat Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 in the FA Trophy Final. The 2007–08 witnessed Henry continue to hold down his place as a first–team regular under both Mark Stimson and Peter Taylor. However, in January of the same season, it was announced that Henry was put on the transfer–list after he was unable to agree terms on a new deal. Despite this, he continued to feature in the first-team until the end of the season. Following the <b>re-appointment</b> of manager Graham Westley, Henry signed a new-contract at Stevenage and again, featured regularly at right–back during the 2008–09 season. He was also a key part in the side's successful FA Trophy campaign in the same season, playing in all seven matches, including the 2–0 win against York City in the final at Wembley Stadium.|$|E

The only line built in the early 70s was the [...] to Macduff and few carriages and no locomotives were built until 1876. The Deeside Railway merged in 1875, the Aboyne & Braemar extension to Ballater in January 1876, and the Morayshire Railway was absorbed in 1880. After an engine boiler exploded at Nethy Bridge in September 1878, the inquiry found the testing of boilers infrequent and inadequate. It was sixteen months before the locomotive was repaired.|$|E

500|$|Pugh {{remained}} with Bournemouth for 2012–13, {{with the club}} not receiving any offers for him over the summer of 2012. He started the season in indifferent form, much {{like the rest of}} the team, and had a brief spell on the bench during September 2012. He described Eddie Howe as a manager who [...] "expects and demands the best" [...] upon his <b>re-appointment</b> at Bournemouth; Pugh scored in the returning manager's first match in charge, a 2–0 home win over Leyton Orient on 13 October 2012. Pugh signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract with the club in November 2012, tying him to the club until the summer of 2016. He cited the return of Howe and Bournemouth's promotion credentials as his reasons for signing a new contract. He established himself as an important player for Bournemouth in 2012–13, as they pushed for promotion. They finished the season with promotion into the Championship as League One runners-up, Pugh having contributed with 8 goals from 46 appearances.|$|E
500|$|There, in December 866, Isa secured his <b>re-appointment</b> to the {{governorship}} of both Palestine and {{the province of}} Jordan (Jund al-Urdunn). Al-Tabari attributes this {{to the influence of}} Bugha al-Sharabi, whom he bribed with 40,000 gold dinars, while al-Mas'udi claims that this was because of the riches he brought with him from Egypt, as well as 70 Alids who had fled from the Hijaz. He did not immediately return to Palestine, instead sending his lieutenant Abu'l-Maghra' ibn Musa ibn Zurara there as his deputy. When he finally arrived in Ramla, Isa used the ongoing anarchy in Iraq to set himself up as a virtually independent ruler. He kept the province's revenues for himself, and even intercepted the tax caravans from Egypt. He then used this money to secure the loyalty of the local Arab tribes, the Rabi'a in the north and the Banu Kilab in the south, with whom he even formed a marriage alliance, marrying a Kilabi wife. Soon, his nascent Bedouin state was strong enough that he took control of Damascus itself.|$|E

Colvin, was appointed by President Ronald Reagan). [...] President Bill Clinton also was criticized for not acting timely to re-appoint Tax Court judges, having allowed one sitting Chief Judge's term to expire, thus requiring the Tax Court to elect a new Chief Judge.

2500|$|The acrimonious {{departure}} of Harry Redknapp from Portsmouth to Southampton brought the bitter rivalry {{between the two}} clubs to a new level. When Redknapp returned to Portsmouth in November 2005 following Southampton's relegation, it only served to further sour {{relations between the two}} clubs, which arguably remain at an all-time low. The two clubs' chairmen at the time, Rupert Lowe (Southampton) and Milan Mandarić (Portsmouth), publicly criticised one another on a number of occasions, with Lowe calling for an inquest into irregular betting patterns in the run-up to Redknapp's <b>re-appointment.</b> Mandarić had even sent a boxed duck as a Christmas [...] "gift" [...] to Lowe (as Lowe had been on a hunting trip when the [...] "ordeal" [...] began), but the gesture only furthered the animosity between the two.|$|E
2500|$|The FPC was a five-member {{regulatory}} body {{appointed by the}} President and confirmed by the Senate. One of the FPC's strongest leaders was Leland Olds. Olds' insistence on enforcing the Natural Gas Act of 1938 raised the ire {{of the oil industry}} in Texas and led {{to the end of his}} tenure at the FPC. Robert Caro's book Master of the Senate describes how Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Leland's <b>re-appointment</b> by orchestrating a McCarthyism-style smear campaign. The tactics involved having the staff of the House Un-American Activities Committee dig up old writings, which were then taken out of context to falsely paint Olds as a communist. The subcommittee in charge of reappointment was stacked against Leland and coached by Johnson. [...] Following such episodes, the FPC was reluctant to impose price regulation on the producers.|$|E
2500|$|Bankruptcy Court Judge Bason was {{appointed}} to the District of Columbia Bankruptcy Court in February 1984 for a four-year term. He sought <b>re-appointment</b> early in 1987, but was informed in December that the Court of Appeals had chosen another candidate. Judge Bason then suggested {{in a letter to the}} Court of Appeals that DOJ might have improperly influenced the selection process because of his bench ruling for Inslaw. After learning of this letter, DOJ lawyers moved to recuse Judge Bason from the Inslaw case, but their motion was rejected, and Judge Bason remained on the case until the expiration of his term on February 8, 1988. In early February, Judge Bason filed a lawsuit seeking to prevent the judge the Court of Appeals had selected for the District of Columbia Bankruptcy Court from taking office, but the suit was rejected. [...] Bason's last actions in the case were to file a written ruling on Inslaw's adversary proceeding, and to award damages and attorneys fees to Inslaw.|$|E

[...] He became increasingly critical of the Chrétien government during the next two years, and made no secret of his support for Paul Martin to replace Chrétien as party leader. [...] Volpe criticized the Chrétien government for moving too slowly to replace Canada's aging Sea King helicopters, and encouraged the government to purchase the EH-101 Cormorant helicopters recommended by the previous Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. [...] In November 2002, he called for the government to provide compensation for all victims of Hepatitis C who were infected through the national blood supply system, and criticized the Chrétien government's more restrictive settlement. [...] He also expressed skepticism about the Chrétien government's plans to decriminalize cannabis, saying [...] "I believe it's a gateway drug. [...] It's going to be a pretty convincing argument to get me to vote for it." [...] He was an opponent of the government's plans to legalize same-sex marriage during this period, and voted to retain the traditional definition of marriage in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{soon the}} hopes of the Dutch peace-mongers were dashed with the <b>re-appointment</b> of Sir George Downing as English {{ambassador}} in The Hague. Downing had also represented the Commonwealth since 1657, but switched his support to the new régime in time. He was not {{a friend of the}} Dutch, as they well knew. On his return he immediately started meddling in Dutch internal affairs by stoking up Orangist sentiment and by undermining De Witt where possible. The situation was ripe for this, as the Princess Mary had made great advances since August, 1660, convincing Zeeland and Friesland to come out in favor of promising a future stadtholdership for William. The other provinces did not recognize the Act of Exclusion, as we have seen, and even Holland started to have second thoughts. Leiden and Haarlem proposed that the Prince would be designated stadtholder in future, and De Witt deflected this with some difficulty, at the same time making financial concessions to William's mother, promising to pay for his education as [...] "Child of State". To further mollify her (in hopes of her influencing her brother in favor of the Dutch), the Act of Exclusion was formally revoked in September, 1660 (the Commonwealth having expired as a state, this could be excused as not being a breach of treaty).|$|E
