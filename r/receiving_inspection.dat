40|$|This project {{involves}} innovating {{the way the}} Quality Assurance organization at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) {{tracks the}} <b>receiving</b> <b>inspection</b> of JPL Critical Items (JCI) procured from suppliers. The Quality Assurance organization uses a Microsoft Access based front-end to enter items into an inspection queue. The current design has grown {{to be much more}} than was expected when the inspection queue system was created in 2007. The goal is to migrate to a web based solution that will allow the handling of more data, multiple input interfaces, and customizable display options. This has been achieved by implementing a divided tables scheme, the use of ColdFusion programming language, and the usage of Web 2. 0 technologies such as AJAX and jQuery. These updates will allow for future expansion as well as the standardization of inspection queues for the Quality Assurance organization. When engineers and scientists order flight hardware, they cannot use it straight away. After a spacecraft or a satellite has been launched, it will be impossible to repair; therefore, the parts used must be inspected {{to make sure they are}} operating correctly and within the required specifications. The task of inspecting these JPL Critical Items (JCI) falls on the Quality Assurance organization. One of the tools the <b>receiving</b> <b>inspection</b> group uses is a database to maintain a queue of inspections that need to be done and of inspections that have been completed. The current Access interface has worked well but increased amounts of data, multiple input interfaces, and changes to how data is handled have made it necessary to seek a new way of organizing items for inspection. In addition, the different inspection groups have recently been merged and each has different ways of keeping track of inspection information. The ultimate goal is for the new group to have one shared inspection queue and website. To achieve this goal, I have been working with Ian Luczon of Procurement Quality Assurance and 3 Myers Hawkins, another intern, to not only create the new queue for <b>receiving</b> <b>inspection</b> but also a central web portal for the newly combined inspection group...|$|E

Cost savings for one program affected by the proposed change are derived. Proposal two, described in section two, suggests the method of work sampling as a tool for management's use in dealing with non-productive employees.

40|$|Uranium cores have a {{grain size}} {{specification}} of A 8 to A 3. Large grain size is denoted {{by a small}} ``A`` number and small grain by larger ``A`` numbers. Grain sizes smaller than A 9 denote an untransformed core which presumably has a high rupture potential. Grain sizes larger than A 3 cause swelling, or bumping, of the fuel thus increasing the probability of rupture failure. Presently, tests are made on all cores received to determine compliance to the above specifications. As {{a result of a}} recent study and analysis of all pertinent factors applicable to this situation, it is concluded that 100 % inspection of all lots received at HAPO for compliance to grain size specifications is neither warranted nor economically justifiable. In lieu of the present screening, a system is proposed to insure that screening is effected only when there is an economic incentive. Such a system requires that the Feedsite (NLO) maintain its present process control sampling plan of 5 cores per ingot. A sampling <b>receiving</b> <b>inspection</b> at HAPO will be used to detect major shifts in the quality of cores to insure that screening is used only when there is an economic incentive. This sampling inspection, in place of the present 100 % screening, will result in an estimated annual savings, to IPD, of $ 52, 500, based on the 0. 0057 % defective rate currently observed in the incoming material received at HAPO...|$|E

40|$|Injectable drugs, {{like those}} {{manufactured}} by the BioPharmOps group of Novartis Pharmaceuticals AG, must conform to strict guidelines for purity and potency. Recent non-conformances of critical supplied consumables have revealed potential business and patient safety risks for biotechnology manufacturers worldwide. As a result, Novartis {{has launched a}} program to enhance control systems over all consumables and their suppliers. Within this program, the author has developed a system to identify, analyze, and mitigate the various risks which may impact the business due to non-conformances in supplied consumables. The first function {{of the system is}} the identification of key risks and their potential effects according to various failure modes that have been observed during the use of the consumables in production. This is accomplished with a standardized list of possible failure modes which can be applied to all consumables. The categorization allows the relative risk of each failure mode to be compared among consumables. Secondly, the risk of contamination is evaluated using a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) framework. The three dimensions of the FMEA framework are the severity, likelihood, and detectability of a failure. The severity of each failure mode is assessed by analyzing the quantitative and qualitative impact that a failure might have on the purity and potency of the drug. This calculation is based on the properties of each consumable and its use in the production system. The likelihood of failure events is assessed through an analysis of the complexity of the consumable and its supply chain, and a review of the quality systems at the supplier. Detectability analysis considers the tests and inspections in place at various stages including consumable manufacturing, <b>receiving</b> <b>inspection,</b> and in-process tests during drug manufacturing which could detect a non-conformance. The total risk level is evaluated as the product of these three dimensions and a threshold is defined for requiring additional mitigations for these risks. This risk assessment method is implemented in an automated worksheet to ensure consistency among users and efficient analysis. The third outcome of the system is the recommendation of mitigations to reduce total exposure to contamination risk. Mitigations may be internal (new tests and inspections) or implemented at the supplier (improved sampling rates, enhanced general quality systems, or new controls). The recommended mitigations provide guidance for the reduction of risks to an acceptable level, and when implemented, the impact and frequency of non-conformances will be diminished. Ultimately, this reduces Novartis' exposure to potential business loss and protects patients from injury caused by contamination. by David Linders. Thesis (S. M.)
