40|$|We study price {{determination}} and exchange patterns in a monopolistically competitive economy, {{in which both}} goods and (fiat) money are perfectly divisible. The decentralized trading environment features 'multiple matches,' in which households consume bundles of commodities and have a preference for consumption variety. Although each household contacts many sellers, the variety of the consumption basket that results under barter mediated exchange is sparser than that obtained with monetary exchange. In the latter setting, households need only to locate a good they want, while {{in the former the}} more stringent double coincidence of wants must be satisfies. We examine pricing and consider the effects of monetary policy. We show that a sufficiently rapid expansion of the money supply leads to the gradual emergence of barter. Under these circumstances sellers accept both goods and cash payments and workers receive part of their <b>remuneration</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> Search, fiat money, barter, neutrality...|$|E

50|$|Domestic {{migrant workers}} have been {{estimated}} to be about 4.2 million - (Domestic workers, not domestic migrant workers). These workers range from full-time to part-time workers, temporary or permanent workers. They are typically employed for <b>remuneration</b> <b>in</b> cash or <b>kind,</b> <b>in</b> any household through any agency or directly, to do the household work, but do not include {{any member of the}} family of an employer. Some of these work exclusively for a single employer, while others work for more than one employer. Some are live-in workers, while some are seasonal. The employment of these migrant workers is typically at the will of the employer and the worker, and compensation varies.|$|R

3000|$|A {{straightforward}} {{example is}} wind shelter from planted trees. Significant shelter may be provided at {{the boundary between}} forest and pastoral land ownerships, shelter then being a classical economic externality: the benefit is matched by neither monetary <b>remuneration</b> nor benefit <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> to the forest owner. However, reduced wind-speed reduces heat loss from out-wintered livestock, which reduces energy consumption for temperature maintenance, reducing winter weight loss and increasing survival of offspring. Applying sale prices to the increased output gives the economic consequence of shelter. Note immediately that good ecosystem economics is not opposed to good ecosystem science, but is necessarily based on it. Energy conservation enters the valuation via measurement of physical response to changed environment. In an experiment in Eddleston Forest near Edinburgh in the 1980 s, [...] "artificial sheep" [...] were used in open and forest conditions, the energy consumption entailed in maintaining mammalian body temperature being measured, inside simulated insulating layers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{declaration}} of the World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm in 1996, defined CSEC as, [...] "sexual abuse by the adult and <b>remuneration</b> <b>in</b> cash or <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> to the child or to a third person or persons. The child is treated as a sexual object and as a commercial object".|$|R
5000|$|For {{statistical}} purposes, {{the relationship}} of employer to employee exists, {{when there is an}} agreement, formal or informal, between an enterprise and a person, normally entered into voluntarily by both parties, whereby the person works for the enterprise, <b>in</b> return for <b>remuneration</b> <b>in</b> cash or <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> The <b>remuneration</b> is normally based on either the time spent at work, or some other objective indicator of the amount of work done.|$|R
50|$|Compensation of {{employees}} is accounted for on an accrual basis; i.e., it {{is measured by}} the value of the <b>remuneration</b> <b>in</b> cash or <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> which an employee becomes entitled to receive from an employer in respect of work done, during the relevant accounting period - whether paid in advance, simultaneously, or in arrears of the work itself. This contrasts with other inputs to production, which are to be valued at the point when they are actually used.|$|R
5000|$|However, in reality, the {{aggregate}} {{includes more than}} just gross wages, at least in national accounts and balance of payments statistics. The reason is that in these accounts, CE is defined as [...] "the total <b>remuneration,</b> <b>in</b> cash or <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> payable by an enterprise to an employee in return for work done by the latter during the accounting period". It represents effectively a total labour cost to an employer, paid from the gross revenues or the capital of an enterprise.|$|R
2500|$|Commercial sexual {{exploitation}} of children (CSEC) {{is defined by}} the Declaration of the First World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm in 1996, as [...] "sexual abuse by an adult accompanied by <b>remuneration</b> <b>in</b> cash or <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> to the child or third person(s)." [...] CSEC usually takes the form of child prostitution or child pornography, and is often facilitated by child sex tourism. CSEC is particularly a problem in developing countries of Asia. In recent years, new innovations in technology have facilitated the trade of Internet child pornography.|$|R

5000|$|It {{has also}} been shown how greatly a fresh spirit of {{enterprise}} in industry and trade was stimulated first by the Danish and next by the Norman invasion; the former brought in a vigour shown in growth of villages, increase in number of freemen, and formation of trading towns; the latter especially opened up new communications with the most civilised continental people, and was followed by a considerable immigration of artisans, particularly of Flemings. In Saxon England slavery in the strictest sense existed, as is shown in the earliest English laws, but it seems that the true slave class as distinct from the serf class was comparatively small, and {{it may well be that}} the labour of an ordinary serf was not practically more severe, and the <b>remuneration</b> <b>in</b> maintenance and <b>kind</b> not much less than that of agricultural labourers in recent times. In spite of the steady protest of the Church, slavery (as the exception, not the general rule) did not die out for many centuries, and was apt to be revived as a punishment for criminals, e.g. in the fierce provisions of the statute of Edward VI against beggars, not repealed until 1597. At no time, however, was it general, and as the larger village and city populations grew the ratio of serfs and slaves to the freemen in the whole population rapidly diminished, for the city populations [...] "had not the habit and use of slavery," [...] and while serfs might sometimes find a refuge in the cities from exceptionally severe taskmasters," [...] there is no doubt that freemen gradually united with them under the lord's protection, that strangers engaged in trade sojourned among them, and that a race of artisans gradually grew up in which original class feelings were greatly modified." ...|$|R

I think that when one person regularly gives a lift to another in return for money, there is a contract, albeit informal". In a similar [...] "lifts for friends case", Albert v MIB 1971, the House of Lords approved Denning's decision in Connell.|$|R
