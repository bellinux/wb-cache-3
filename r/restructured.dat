40|$|AbstractThis paper {{estimates}} {{the price for}} <b>restructuring</b> risk in the US corporate bond market during 1999 – 2005. Comparing quotes from default swap (CDS) contracts with a <b>restructuring</b> event and without, {{we find that the}} average premium for <b>restructuring</b> risk represents 6 %– 8 % of the swap rate without <b>restructuring.</b> We show that the <b>restructuring</b> premium depends on firm-specific balance-sheet and macroeconomic variables. And, when default swap rates without a <b>restructuring</b> event increase, the increase in <b>restructuring</b> premia is higher for low-credit-quality firms than for high-credit-quality firms. We propose a reduced-form arbitrage-free model for pricing default swaps that explicitly incorporates the distinction between <b>restructuring</b> and default events.

40|$|The {{decision}} to <b>restructure</b> a firm {{is very difficult}} for many companies because it often has a big impact on the company financially and culturally. <b>Restructuring</b> is often a necessary decision for firms in financial distress, and my research seeks to determine whether the market reacts positively or negatively to <b>restructuring</b> charges over time. Much research has been done to determine whether <b>restructuring</b> creates value for the company and increases future performance, but less has been done to determine the stock market reaction that comes as a result of <b>restructuring.</b> Prior literature suggests that <b>restructuring</b> is often a positive decision for companies, which led to my hypothesis that stock price would increase more in companies that had higher levels of <b>restructuring</b> charges over the period measured. I measured companies’ <b>restructuring</b> charges as a percent of operating income over a ten-year period and compared those percentages to the change in stock price over that same period. My results suggest that companies who did not <b>restructure,</b> or recognized lower levels of <b>restructuring</b> charges, had higher positive increases in stock price than those that had higher levels of <b>restructuring</b> charges. Because this result is contrary to much of the prior research, investors’ reaction to <b>restructuring</b> should continue to be studied...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the general principles of <b>restructuring</b> enterprises, submits various {{interpretations of the}} concept "restructuring" and states the content and activities of <b>restructuring</b> enterprises. <b>Restructuring</b> enterprises can be implemented according to certain stages.

Seeking for <b>restructuring</b> the enterprise, first, the expediency and possibilities of the actions taken must be well-grounded. Then, the conception of <b>restructuring</b> and directions for implementing it are fixed; they stipulate the selection of the form of <b>restructuring</b> the enterprise (anti-crisis management instrument).
