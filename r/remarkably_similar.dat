5|$|Chopin's {{influence}} is marked {{in the first}} two pieces. Orledge observes that the right-hand figuration at the end of No 1 is <b>remarkably</b> <b>similar</b> to {{that at the end of}} Chopin's Waltz in E minor. In No 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt (Au bord d'une source) in the opening bars. In the closing bars of No 2, Orledge finds a resemblance to the end of Chopin's Grande Valse Brillante, Op, 18.|$|E
5|$|Despite these differences, {{the leading}} causes {{of death in the}} United States are <b>remarkably</b> <b>similar</b> for men and women, headed by heart disease, which {{accounts}} for a quarter of all deaths, followed by cancer, lung disease and stroke. While women have a lower incidence of death from unintentional injury (see below) and suicide, they have a higher incidence of dementia (Gronowski and Schindler, Table I).|$|E
5|$|Although no flight-deck cruisers {{were ever}} {{built by the}} U.S. Navy, the Soviet Union's , {{developed}} in the 1970s, is <b>remarkably</b> <b>similar</b> {{to that of the}} original flight-deck cruiser design, featuring an angled flight deck aft with anti-ship missile launchers forwards. In addition, during the early 1980s, plans were proposed for the reactivation of the U.S. Navy's Iowa-class battleships that entailed the removal of each ship's aft turret and the installation of a flight deck for operating V/STOL aircraft; in the end a much more modest conversion, lacking the flight deck, was carried out.|$|E

50|$|Pine woods {{tree frogs}} lay eggs in ephemeral water bodies. Eggs {{generally}} hatch within 24 hours, and tadpoles metamorphose into froglets after 50-75 days at 11-15 mm in length. Tadpoles are <b>remarkably</b> variable; <b>similar</b> to the squirrel tree frog (Hyla squirella), {{the presence or}} absence of dragonfly larvae (a predator) induces a dramatic, red-colored tail.|$|R
5|$|Because it {{displays}} features {{common to}} both birds and non-avian dinosaurs, Archaeopteryx {{has often been}} considered a link between them. In the 1970s, John Ostrom, following Thomas Henry Huxley's lead in 1868, argued that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx was a critical piece of evidence for this argument; it had several avian features, such as a wishbone, flight feathers, wings, and a partially reversed first toe along with dinosaur and theropod features. For instance, it has a long ascending process of the ankle bone, interdental plates, an obturator process of the ischium, and long chevrons in the tail. In particular, Ostrom found that Archaeopteryx was <b>remarkably</b> <b>similar</b> to the theropod family Dromaeosauridae.|$|E
5|$|Nick's older sister, Gabrielle, {{became a}} {{successful}} {{film and television}} actress. Both parents were musically inclined and each wrote pieces of music. Recordings of Molly Drake's songs, which have come to light since her death, are <b>remarkably</b> <b>similar</b> in tone and outlook to the later work of her son. Mother and son shared a similar fragile vocal delivery; both Gabrielle and biographer Trevor Dann have noted a parallel sense of foreboding and fatalism in their music. Encouraged by his mother, Drake learned to play piano {{at an early age}} and began to compose songs which he recorded on a reel-to-reel tape recorder she kept in the family drawing room.|$|E
5|$|Already {{frequently}} {{compared to}} compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi proved their similarity when he nearly replicated Maradona's two most famous {{goals in the}} span of three weeks. During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal <b>remarkably</b> <b>similar</b> to Maradona's goal in the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, known as the Goal of the Century. Messi collected the ball on the right side near the halfway line, ran , and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done. A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match. As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.|$|E

Isofunctional enzymes from different bacterial genera share a common evolutionary origin. Moreover, enzymes that mediate isofunctional or chemically analogous reactions within an organism appear to be evolutionarily homologous.

5|$|Early {{polls showed}} that Beshear and Henry led the Democratic field in name recognition, but both trailed Fletcher and his Republican primary rival Anne Northup in that area. Early in the campaign, Beshear {{attempted}} to set himself {{apart from the}} other candidates by supporting a constitutional amendment that would allow expanded casino gambling in the state, which he claimed could generate $500 million in new revenue without the need to raise taxes. Observers noted that this strategy was <b>remarkably</b> <b>similar</b> to the one used by Wallace Wilkinson who, in his 1987 primary victory over Beshear and others, trumpeted the revenue a state lottery would generate. Initially, all of the Democratic candidates except Hensley endorsed a casino amendment, but as Beshear made it the centerpiece of his campaign, support from other candidates began to waver; Richards officially changed his position to oppose the amendment, while several other candidates charged that Beshear was staking too much of his platform on a proposal that was not guaranteed to pass.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyena {{societies}} {{are more complex}} than those of other carnivorous mammals, and are <b>remarkably</b> <b>similar</b> to those of cercopithecine primates in respect to group size, structure, competition and cooperation. Like cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities, recognise individual conspecifics, are conscious that some clan-mates may be more reliable than others, recognise third-party kin and rank relationships among clan-mates, and adaptively use this knowledge during social decision making. Also, like cercopithecine primates, dominance ranks in hyena {{societies are}} not correlated with size or aggression, but with ally networks. In this latter trait, the spotted hyena further show parallels with primates by acquiring rank through coalition. However, rank reversals and overthrows in spotted hyena clans are very rare. The social network dynamics of spotted hyenas are determined by multiple factors. Environmental factors include rainfall and prey abundance; individual factors include preference to bond with females and with kin; and topological effects include the tendency to close triads in the network. Female hyenas are more flexible than males in their social bonding preferences.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} {{shows that the}} pelican lineage has existed for at least 30million years; the oldest known pelican fossil was found in Early Oligocene {{deposits}} at the Luberon in southeastern France and is <b>remarkably</b> <b>similar</b> to modern forms. Its beak is almost complete and is morphologically identical to that of present-day pelicans, showing that this advanced feeding apparatus was already in existence at the time. An Early Miocene fossil has been named Miopelecanus gracilis {{on the basis of}} certain features originally considered unique but later thought to lie within the range of inter-specific variation in Pelecanus. The Late Eocene Protopelicanus may be a pelecaniform or suliform – or a similar aquatic bird such as a pseudotooth (Pelagornithidae). The supposed Miocene pelican Liptornis from Patagonia is a nomen dubium (of doubtful validity), being based on fragments providing insufficient evidence to support a valid description.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In simple {{epithelial}} cells, apical and basolateral proteins are sorted {{into separate}} vesicular carriers before delivery to the appropriate plasma membrane domains. To dissect the putative sorting machinery, we have solubilized Golgi-derived transport vesicles with the detergent CHAPS and shown that an apical marker, influenza haemagglutinin (HA), formed a large complex together with several integral membrane proteins. <b>Remarkably,</b> a <b>similar</b> set of CHAPS-insoluble proteins was found after solubilization of a total cellular membrane fraction.

5|$|Despite {{the brief}} {{duration}} of his dynasty, Ibn Tulun's rule was a seminal event {{not only for}} Egypt, but for the entire Islamic world. For Egypt itself, his reign marks a turning point as {{the country for the}} first time since the Pharaohs ceased being a passive province subject to a foreign imperial power, and became once again a political actor in its own right. The new realm Ibn Tulun forged, encompassing Egypt and Syria as well as the Jazira and Cilicia, and to a lesser extent the eastern parts of the Maghreb, established a new political zone separated from the Islamic lands further east, restoring in a fashion the frontier that had existed between the Roman/Byzantine and Sassanid Persian realms in Antiquity. Egypt was the basis of Ibn Tulun's power; he paid particular attention to restoring its economy, as well as establishing an autonomous bureaucracy, army, and navy. These policies were continued by later Egypt-based regimes, the Ikhshidids (935–969) and eventually the Fatimids (969–1171), who likewise used Egypt's wealth to establish control over parts or even most of Syria. Indeed, as Thierry Bianquis remarks, the territory ruled by Ibn Tulun in Syria was <b>remarkably</b> <b>similar</b> to that controlled by the later Egypt-based regimes of Saladin and the Mamluk Sultanate.|$|E
5|$|In Kansas City, Kansas, two {{religious}} missionaries visit {{two women}} at two different {{homes in the}} same neighborhood who look exactly alike. The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two FBI agents who look and sound <b>remarkably</b> <b>similar</b> to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton (Kathy Griffin). Betty claims to have never seen the other woman before. The other woman then passes her by in a car and the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after the gruesome mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed. Meanwhile, the other woman, Lulu Pfeiffer (also Kathy Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get it because she has had 17 jobs in 17 states {{in the past three years}} and moves around too much. She becomes aggravated and suddenly, all the copies become black. The other woman, Betty, goes to another job with the same name and same resume.|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} has a {{well-developed}} sense of smell, which it uses to locate its food. The process of smelling works very differently {{depending on whether}} the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air. As most crabs live in the water, they have specialised organs called s on their antennae to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell. However, as coconut crabs live on the land, the aesthetascs on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and look more like those of insects. While insects and the coconut crab originate from different paths, the same need to detect smells in the air {{led to the development of}} <b>remarkably</b> <b>similar</b> organs. Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances. The smells of rotting meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially. Research has shown that the olfactory system in the coconut crab's brain is well-developed compared to other areas of the brain.|$|E
