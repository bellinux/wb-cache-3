5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Bianca Casfafiore in the story– a famous opera singer, {{pursued by the}} press, and changing her outfit for every occasion– {{was influenced by the}} life of the opera singer Maria Callas. One of the new characters that Hergé introduced into the story was the stonemason Arthur Bolt (M. Boullu in the original French version), whose characterisation was based on a real individual who worked for Hergé. Hergé's {{depiction of}} the paparazzi within the story may have been influenced by his own repeat encounters with the press throughout his career. The <b>reporter</b> <b>and</b> the photographer, Christopher Willoughby-Droupe and Marco Rizotto (Jean-Loup de la Battelerie and Walter Rizotto respectively in the original French version) of the Paris Flash, are introduced into the series here, and would later be retroactively added into a re-drawing of The Black Island (1938) by Bob de Moor, also making a reappearance in Tintin and the Picaros (1976). The idea of having a proposed marriage between Castafiore and Haddock was based on a reader's suggestion that Haddock marry.|$|E
