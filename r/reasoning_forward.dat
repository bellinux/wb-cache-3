40|$|Open {{data sources}} {{regarding}} conflicts are increasingly enriched by broad social media; these yield {{a volume of}} information that exceeds our process capabilities. One of the critical factors is that knowledge extraction from mixed data formats requires systematic, sophisticated modeling. Here, we propose using text mining modeling tools for building associations of heterogeneous semi-structured data to enhance decision-making. Using narrative plots, text representation, and cluster analysis, we provide a data association framework that can mine spatiotemporal data that occur in similar contexts. The framework contains the following steps: (1) a novel text representation is presented to vectorize the textual semantics by learning both co-word features and word orders in a unified form; (2) text clustering technology is employed to associate events of interest with similar events in historical logs, based solely on narrative plots of the events; and (3) the inferred activity procedure is visualized via an evolving spatiotemporal map through the Kriging algorithm. Our results demonstrate that the approach enables deeper discrimination into the trends underlying conflicts and possesses a narrative <b>reasoning</b> <b>forward</b> prediction with a precision of 0. 4817, {{in addition to a}} high consistency with the conclusions of existing studies...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{theoretical}} framework for efficiently checking the consistency of deductive databases is provided and proven to be correct. Our method is based on focussing on the relevant parts of the database by <b>reasoning</b> <b>forwards</b> from the updates of a transaction, and using this knowledge about real or just possible implicit updates for simplifying the consistency constraints in question. Opposite to the algorithms by Kowalski/Sadri and Lloyd/Topor, we are neither committed to determine the exact set of implicit updates nor to determine a fairly large superset of it by only considering the head literals of deductive rule clauses. Rather, our algorithm unifies these two approaches by allowing to choose {{any of the above}} or even intermediate strategies for any step of <b>reasoning</b> <b>forwards.</b> This flexibility renders possible the integration of statistical data and knowledge about access paths into the checking process.

40|$|In this lecture {{we return}} to the view that a logic program is defined by a {{collection}} of inference rules for atomic propositions. But we now base the operational semantics on <b>reasoning</b> <b>forward</b> from facts, which are initially given as rules with no premisses. Every rule application potentially adds new facts. Whenever no more new facts can be generated we say forward reasoning saturates and we can answer questions about truth by examining the saturated database of facts. We illustrate bottom-up logic programming with several programs, including graph reachability, CKY parsing, and liveness analysis. 20. 1 Bottom-Up Inference We now return the very origins of logic programming as an operational interpretation of inference rules defining atomic predicates. As a reminder, consider the definition of even. even(z) evz even(N) even(s(s(N))) evss This works very well on queries such as even(s(s(s(s(z))))) (which succeeds) and even(s(s(s(z)))) (which fails). In fact, the operational reading of this program under goal-directed search constitutes a decision procedure for ground queries even(n). This specification makes little sense under an alternative interpretation where we eagerly apply the inference rules in the forward direction, from the premisses to the conclusion, until no new facts can be deduced.

40|$|This study investigates {{strategies}} in reasoning about mental states of others, {{a process that}} requires theory of mind. It {{is a first step}} in studying the cognitive basis of such reasoning, as strategies affect tradeoffs between cognitive resources. Participants were presented with a two-player game that required reasoning about the mental states of the opponent. Game theory literature discerns two candidate strategies that participants could use in this game: either forward reasoning or backward <b>reasoning.</b> <b>Forward</b> reasoning proceeds from the first decision point to the last, whereas backward reasoning proceeds in the opposite direction. Backward reasoning is the only optimal strategy, because the optimal outcome is known at each decision point. Nevertheless, we argue that participants prefer forward reasoning because it is similar to causal reasoning. Causal reasoning, in turn, is prevalent in human reasoning. Eye movements were measured to discern between forward and backward progressions of fixations. The observed fixation sequences corresponded best with forward reasoning. Early in games, the probability of observing a forward progression of fixations is higher than the probability of observing a backward progression. Later in games, the probabilities of forward and backward progressions are similar, which seems to imply that participants were either applying backward reasoning or jumping back to previous decision points while applying forward reasoning. Thus, the game-theoretical favorite strategy, backward reasoning, does seem to exist in human reasoning. However, participants preferred the more familiar, practiced, and prevalent strategy: forward reasoning. © 2012 Meijering et al...|$|E

For {{those who do not}} happen to have direct access to the realm of mathematical truths, the modern field of formalized mathematics has quite a few lessons to contribute, and one might pay heed to what it has to say, for instance, about: the importance of employing proof strategies; the fine control of automation in unraveling the structure of a certain proof object; <b>reasoning</b> <b>forward</b> from the givens and backward from the goals, in developing proof scripts; knowing when and how definitions and identities apply in a helpful way, and when they do not apply; seeing proofs [and refutations] as dynamical objects, not reflected by the static derivation trees that Proof Theory wants them to be.

Pure horn rules - given as Prolog clauses - {{are to be}} used for <b>forward</b> and backward <b>reasoning.</b> These rules are translated into Prolog clauses, denoting one <b>forward</b> <b>reasoning</b> step. <b>Forward</b> chaining is triggered by an initial fact, from which the consequences are derived.

Breadth-first and depth-first reasoning strategies with enumeration and collection of conclusions are implemented. In order to translate forward clauses into WAM operations several improvements are introduced. To avoid inefficient changes of program code derived facts are recorded in a special storage area called retain stack.

Introduction A great deal of attention has been given to the problem of formalising prediction, that is <b>reasoning</b> <b>forwards</b> in time from causes to effects, and in particular to the logical aspect of the frame problem. Fewer authors, however, have studied the converse problem of formalising temporal explanation (or postdiction), that is reasoning backwards in time from effects to causes.
