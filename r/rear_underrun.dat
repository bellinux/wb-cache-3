50|$|Technically {{called a}} <b>Rear</b> <b>Underrun</b> Protection System (RUPS), {{this is a}} rigid {{assembly}} hanging down from the bottom rear of the trailer, which is intended to provide some protection for passenger cars which collide with {{the rear of the}} trailer. Public awareness of this safeguard was increased {{in the aftermath of the}} accident that killed actress Jayne Mansfield on 29 June 1967, when the car she was in hit the rear of a tractor-trailer, causing fatal head trauma. After her death, the NHTSA recommended requiring a rear underride guard, also known as a Mansfield bar, an ICC bar, or a DOT bumper, but the trucking industry has been slow to upgrade this safety feature.|$|E
40|$|Keywords：truck; {{protective}} device; the swinging; welding; {{bolted connection}} Abstract: Using three-dimensional modeling software {{to design a}} kind of swinging <b>rear</b> <b>underrun</b> protective device, using the Ansys finite element analysis software, {{in accordance with the}} provisions of GB 11567. 2 - 2001, the <b>rear</b> <b>underrun</b> protective device applied static load analysis. The results show that the protective device and the body in the welding and bolt connecting two different cases, connected by bolts can effectively avoid the connection of stress concentration, and support as {{the main part of the}} force. But by welding, the connections exist obvious stress concentration, may to cause the protective frame dropping...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{optimization}} process {{of a new}} High Energy Absorption <b>Rear</b> <b>Underrun</b> Protective Device called HEARUPD is discussed. The main objectives of the HEARUPD design optimization process have been related to the reduction in car decelerations (high crashworthiness) and avoiding the car underrun (high structure stability). In the implemented optimization process, the crash between an economy car (GEO Metro) and the rear part of a truck has been simulated by numerical models. A linear function of the decelerations measured on the car {{has been used as}} objective to minimize, the main dimensional values of the <b>rear</b> <b>underrun</b> protective device, instead, have been chosen as design variables. The Simplex Method has been used as optimization technique. At the end, a detailed analysis of the optimized model has been also performed. The obtained results have shown the HEARUPD, in comparison with a reference device, is able to dissipate a higher quantity of energy, reducing both the deceleration peaks and the frontal car crushing...|$|E
40|$|Freno AB in Piteå has {{developed}} a tractor with a semi-trailer based on a Volkswagen Crafter chassis. The modifications of the vehicle that are included in this thesis work covers the parking brake system of the semitrailer, the <b>rear</b> <b>underrun</b> protection device of the tractor and the maneuvering of the trailer’s service brake. The manufacturer of the tractor requests an independent analysis of whether these modifications have negative influences on the vehicle. A description of the parking brake system was made and its function was analyzed using force and torque equilibrium. The parking brake of the semi-trailer is maneuvered by an electric signal from the switch controlling the parking brake indicator on the dash board. The results were compared with regulations applicable by {{the date of the}} vehicle’s service entry. In theory, the parking brake meets the legal requirement to keep the vehicle stationary in a hill with 16 % slope and the design requirement of 18 %. Regulations regarding the <b>rear</b> <b>underrun</b> protection were studied and the company’s contact person was interviewed about the modification’s procedure. The underrun protection device has been moved forwards due to the shortening of the rear overhang. No modification has been made to the device itself that can affect its strength. According to EU Directive 70 / 221 /EC, <b>rear</b> <b>underrun</b> protection is not necessary for this vehicle type. For the maneuvering system of the semi-trailer’s service brakes, the designer was interviewed and a system description was formulated. The trailer’s service brakes are maneuvered by a directional valve connected to the tractor’s brake circuits. This valve is the only interface between the tractor and the semitrailer brake circuits. The maximum consumption of brake fluid caused by the directional valve is 0. 3 cm 3. A test method was produced to determine if pressure variations caused by the semi-trailer’s ABS system can be measured in the tractors brake circuits. The measurements are to be implemented with a pressure sensor connected to the master brake cylinder and a data logger which measures the brake pressure during a braking operation. Based on the recorded data the process can be analyzed. The test methodology was inspired by the test made to the vehicle by the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) according to Directive 71 / 320 /EC.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{benchmark}} the safety performance of Australia's road transport industry against the safety performance of similar industries {{in a range of}} OECD countries. Its purpose was to guide the development of future policies to improve the safety of the Australian road transport industry, and to provide a focus for the national heavy vehicle safety strategy. Comparisons were made of truck fatalities in Australia, the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Sweden. Fatality rates were used because of the range of comparable data. Injury data were not used because injury reporting criteria and completeness of reporting vary within Australia and in other countries. The study found that Australia's heavy vehicle fatality rate per kilometre travelled is 47 % higher than the USA, 39 % higher than the UK, comparable to Germany and Canada, 20 % lower than Sweden, 45 % lower than France, and 55 % lower than New Zealand. The higher fatality rates on Australian roads compared to Great Britain and the United States maybe largely explained by the lower proportion of truck travel on divided and limited access roads in Australia, and possibly truck speed limits. Areas that have the potential to improve the safety performance of the heavy vehicle industry include road standards, targeted low cost road safety treatments, single vehicle crashes, day and night time driving, measures to improve the safety of truck occupants, front and <b>rear</b> <b>underrun</b> protection, appropriate speed limits, and data collection...|$|E
