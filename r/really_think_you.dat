And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you – where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's, and if you cut them down – and you're just the man to do it – do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Roberts once stated: [...] "You're {{going to}} be {{unemployed}} if you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> just have {{to sit around and}} wait for the muse to land on your shoulder." [...] She concentrates on one novel at a time, writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation. Rather than begin with an outline or plot summary, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting. She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. After finishing the first draft, Roberts goes {{back to the beginning of}} the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the [...] "texture and color" [...] of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was such}} a look of deprecation about him, that she exclaimed, 'One would <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> had been {{accepting}} this charming son-in-law.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Again {{the vision}} of her sister seemed to float into the room, and she went on desperately: [...] "And, Hilary, I can see Mrs. Hughs <b>really</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> are interested. Of course, she wants to, for if you were, it would mean that a man like her husband could have no chance." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY W. [Staring] My dear boy, I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{ought to}} see the Press; it always upsets you.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a lovely}} evening, my dear Watson," [...] said a {{well-known}} voice. [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> will be more comfortable outside than in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{would have}} been sorry if the boys had brought me back with a bullet in me?" [...] he said, half-questioningly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear fellow, I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> hardly {{calculate}} {{the value of}} my time {{when you come to}} me about such an affair as this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> shall do {{anything}} with her?" [...] said Cecil, who might uphold her at home, but whose taste was outraged by her.|$|E
6000|$|BROADBENT [delighted]. I hope so. I <b>think</b> so. [Fluctuating] <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> so? <b>You</b> {{are sure}} you are not {{allowing}} your enthusiasm for our principles to {{get the better of}} your judgment? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, my dear, I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{ought to}} do that. There are little things which {{a man and his}} wife must manage {{together}} without interference.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Considering everything, I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> could {{regard it}} as a liberty," [...] it ran. [...] "You have given me {{a good deal more}} than this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{take it in}} here, and--Miss Howard, one moment, if you please--and there, {{and round}} like this--so--I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will find it quite easy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "George, you are wrong," [...] said Sir Lionel. [...] "If {{you know}} where Lady Harcourt is, you are bound to tell him. I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did it to}} {{make you}} behave yourself," [...] {{answered}} Dick, sternly. [...] "Sobber, I didn't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> could be so mean," [...] he went on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is a}} rum start," [...] his {{companion}} said {{when he had finished}} his story. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> will some day come in for all this money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he only said, 'But he'll ask {{you again}} now, {{you may be}} sure, my child.' And I replied very gravely, I didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would. And do you know, Cyril, I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> do <b>think</b> <b>you</b> might stop, Margaret. Now that we {{have all}} {{got to know each}} other, it will be a great pity that it all should be broken up." ...|$|R
6000|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Of course. Believe me, I did not <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> were married: you are {{obviously}} too young; {{but here it}} {{is so hard to}} feel sure--er-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> might {{remember}} that I am here," [...] Ella remarked. [...] "It {{is very interesting}} to hear you talk French, but I get tired of it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all, you needn't {{be ashamed}} of the testimonial. I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{deserved}} it, and I suppose I must congratulate you on the fortunate end of your dramatic adventures." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> should be," [...] he said. [...] "I can't help being Tristan Alton's grandson, you see, and we {{are some}} kind of {{relations}} {{and ought to be}} friendly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alexandrina {{has told}} me all about it," [...] said the countess, with her sweetest smile, [...] "and I have given her my approval. I <b>really</b> do <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will suit each other very well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know it is}} out of {{the line}} of your duty to search for island schools, but, if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> do not know where Apple Island lies, I wish you to say so, frankly and openly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{are quite}} right," [...] she said, rising also, [...] "and, besides, you see, {{it will give}} me a chance to talk to her as you wished." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you be {{good enough}} to ride on, Reggie? I told you my opinion of this horse," [...] she said. [...] "Father, I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> ought to thank Mr. Ingleby." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE [relaxing her contemptuous attitude, quite {{interested}} in Mazzini now]. You know, I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> must love Ellie very much; for you become quite clever {{when you talk}} about her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{could expect}} me to make any {{admission}} of that kind about my cigar, Miss Hamilton," [...] he said. [...] "Still, it would perhaps have been excusable. You see, I have {{just come out of}} the Bush." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take care, Ethel, you are {{singeing}} your frock! Well, I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{can help}} those things!" [...] said Flora. [...] "Your short sight {{is the reason}} of it, and it is of no use to try to mend it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{suppose it}} 's a great happiness," [...] said Rowland. [...] "I shall <b>really</b> <b>think</b> of <b>you</b> as living {{here in a}} state of scandalous bliss. I don't believe it 's good for an artist to be in such brutally high spirits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{regret to}} part with you," [...] replied the Mayor; [...] "but, if you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> ought to go, {{we will not be}} so impolite as to urge you to stay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{will be to}} the end," [...] said Amyas, [...] "if {{they come}} off such a devil's tree as that. I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are out of your mind, Captain Raleigh, at times." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Kit, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> did. There are matters {{about which}} we do not agree; but I believe you are too kind to let a rather ignorant {{antagonist}} get hurt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Dave, do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> he'll have <b>you</b> locked up!" [...] {{burst out}} his sister, while Jessie's face showed her deep concern.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] Burton replied, {{removing}} his eyes unwillingly from the passing barrow. [...] "I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> had better take it, Mr. Lynn. You see, {{it is not}} generally known, {{but there is no}} doubt that Lord Idlemay had typhoid fever there." ...|$|R
5000|$|I <b>really</b> do <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{are being}} too serious, besides missing the point. ... You rather {{remind me of}} a Protestant {{relation}} who to me objected to the (modern) Catholic habit of calling priests Father, because the name father belonged only to the First Person.|$|R
