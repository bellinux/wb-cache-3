2500|$|This is {{the reason}} for the {{frequent}} choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts, even when neither entity has extensive contacts with New York—and remarkably often even when neither party has contacts with the United States. Commercial contracts almost always include a [...] "choice of law clause" [...] to reduce uncertainty. Somewhat surprisingly, contracts throughout the world (for example, contracts involving parties in Japan, France and Germany, and from most of the other states of the United States) often choose the law of New York, even where the <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> and transaction to New York is quite attenuated. Because of its history as the United States' commercial center, New York common law has a depth and predictability not (yet) available in any other jurisdictions of the United States. Similarly, American corporations are often formed under Delaware corporate law, and American contracts relating to corporate law issues (merger and acquisitions of companies, rights of shareholders, and so on.) include a Delaware choice of law clause, because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues. On the other hand, some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction (for example, England and Wales, and the state of California), but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law. Outside the United States, parties that are in different jurisdictions from each other often choose the law of England and Wales, particularly when the parties are each in former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth. The common theme in all cases is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations, and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well-developed body of common law to achieve that result.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> politics <b>of</b> urban {{transformation in the}} immediate post-war period of British history, between 1945 and 1970. It centres on <b>the</b> Labour <b>Party</b> and considers <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>party’s</b> socialist aims to modernity as a stimulus for radical urban policy, particularly in terms of housing. Whilst prior historical accounts of post-war urban change have tended to eschew ideology as a serious catalyst for <b>the</b> reconstruction <b>of</b> British cities, arguing instead that pragmatism and corruption were of greater consequence, this thesis contends that a modern, socialist utopian ideal was {{a defining feature of}} urban transformation undertaken by Labour at both a local and national level. Archival material from Labour and <b>the</b> broader left <b>of</b> British politics, published sociological studies from the period 1945 - 70 and my own oral history interviews with key figures from the period lead this investigation. A thorough analysis of Labour’s approach to key aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban environment enables this thesis to challenge existing understandings of post-war urban transformation as irrational or hard-headed. The thesis examines <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> Labour to <b>the</b> housing market, urban planning, understandings <b>of</b> community and <b>the</b> <b>party’s</b> sense <b>of</b> history and modernity. It asserts that rent control, slum clearance and tower blocks were indicative of a modern, socialist urban vision for Labour, proposing that the ‘modern moment’ in twentiethcentury British history be taken into greater consideration. As urban history acquires greater prominence in an age of increasing urbanisation, engagement with the rationale behind past urban transformation can make a significant contribution to <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> why particular urban policies become reality.
