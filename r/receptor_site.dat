5|$|Non{{benzodiazepine}}s also bind to the benzodiazepine {{binding site}} on the GABAA receptor and possess similar pharmacological properties. While the nonbenzodiazepines are by definition structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines, both classes of drugs possess a common pharmacophore (see figure to the lower-right), which explains their binding to a common <b>receptor</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolo{{benzodiazepine}}: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces {{a variety of}} therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine <b>receptor</b> <b>site</b> on the GABAA receptor and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The GABAA receptor {{is made up of}} 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like triazolam that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants, which also have rings. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine <b>receptor</b> <b>site,</b> and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Dextrallorphan {{is often}} used in {{research}} to block σ1 <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> so that σ2 <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> (which have not been cloned yet) can be studied. It was hypothesized that both of these sigma (σ) receptors were opioid receptors, due to their affinity for psychoactive drugs. However, it is now understood that they are non-opioid receptors that bind to certain psychoactive drugs, like dextrallorphan. One example of dextrallorphan being used to mask σ1 <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> was seen in {{a study on the}} localization of the σ2 receptor in detergent-resistant lipid raft domains. [...] It has also been used to mask σ1 <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> so that σ2 receptor binding characteristics in the rat liver could be determined, by labeling σ2 <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> with 3Hl,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) in the presence of 1 μM dextrallorphan solution.|$|R
50|$|However, {{characteristics}} of <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> can vary across different jurisdictions. In some countries, for instance, land is primarily state-owned, {{and so it}} is the government that owns and manages biodiversity offset projects. For biodiversity offsets in marine environments, <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> might be subject to multiple management organisations and not necessarily owned by anyone. Controversially, some biodiversity offsets use existing protected areas as <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> (i.e. improving the effectiveness of areas that are already managed for biodiversity conservation).|$|R
50|$|As {{discussed}} above, larvae feed {{either on}} catkins or oak leaves and twigs {{depending upon the}} season. Adults, on the other hand, feed on nectar. Studies on Lepidoptera have found that feeding behavior is in fact triggered by sugar-receptor communication with chemosensilla, and that both starch and sucrose compete for taste <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> along the sensilla. When starch and sucrose were artificially added to bind to sensilla <b>receptor</b> <b>sites,</b> Lepodoptera stopped food-sucking behavior all together. Even though they were still hungry, their artificially occupied <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> signaled otherwise.|$|R

25|$|A novel {{treatment}} {{approach has}} recently been developed {{as a result of}} translational research. It has been shown that a combination of acute dosing of d-cycloserine (DCS) with exposure therapy facilitates the effects of exposure therapy of social phobia. DCS is an old antibiotic medication used for treating tuberculosis and does not have any anxiolytic properties per se. However, it acts as an agonist at the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) <b>receptor</b> <b>site,</b> which is important for learning and memory.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam {{is often}} {{recommended}} {{due to its}} long elimination half-life and also because of its availability in low potency doses. The non-benzodiazepine Z drugs such as zolpidem, zaleplon, and zopiclone {{should not be used}} as a replacement for benzodiazepines, as they have a similar mechanism of action and can induce a similar dependence. The pharmacological mechanism of benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence is the internalization (removal) of <b>receptor</b> <b>site</b> in the brain and changes in gene transcription codes in the brain.|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated that lentil phytohemagglutinin (lentil-PHA) binds to human platelet membranes without causing either aggregation or the release reaction. When platelets {{are treated with}} thrombin, there {{is an increase in}} lentil-PHA binding suggesting the appearance of new <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> on the cell surface. We prepared a lentil-PHA-ferritin conjugate using affinity chromatography which was used to saturate cell surface <b>receptor</b> <b>sites.</b> Studies using this conjugate suggest that thrombin causes a complex change in the platelet surface involving a {{decrease in the number of}} lentil-PHA <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> on the external platelet surface with a marked increase in sites within the center of the canalicular system. These increased sites may result from fusion of granule membranes with the canalicular membranes during the secretion process.

40|$|The cell surface glycoconjugates {{of various}} rat ascites {{hepatoma}} cell lines with {{different degrees of}} adhesiveness were compared, by binding assays, using ^ I-labelled lectins. Effects of neuraminidase, TPCK-trypsin and chondroitinase ABC treatment of the cells, {{on the number of}} lectin <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> were also studied.

The decrease of wheat germ agglutinin <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> and the increase of castor bean agglutinin <b>receptor</b> <b>sites,</b> after neuraminidase treatment, were larger on the free cell type. It is therefore possible that α-sialyl-β-D-galactosyl residues are abundant on the cell surface of this type, and that its low cell adhesiveness may be due to a electrostatic repulsion of negative charges of the sialic acid...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of beta-adrenergic <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> {{has been studied}} in chicken spinal cord and cerebellum using a fluorescent analogue of propranolol, 9 -amino-acridin-propranolol (9 -AAP). In the cervical and lumbar regions of the spinal cord, beta-adrenoceptor sites were concentrated on cell bodies of alpha-motor neurons of the dorsolateral and ventrolateral nuclear groups of the ventral horn. In the thoracic region, they were present on cell bodies of the preganglionic sympathetic nucleus (dorsal commissural nucleus). In the dorsal horn, the <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> were present mainly on cell bodies of columna dorsalis magnocellularis. Sparse {{distribution of}} fluorescence was present in {{other regions of the}} gray matter. In the cerebellum, a dense distribution of beta-adrenergic <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> was observed on Purkinje cell bodies and their apical dendrites. Sparse distribution of <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> was present on fine ramifications of Purkinje cell dendrites in the molecular layer. <b>Receptor</b> <b>sites</b> were absent in the granule cell layer and the white matter.

25|$|Research {{investigators}} at Takeda {{discovered in}} 1982 the weak nonpeptide Ang II antagonists S-8307 and S-8308 {{from a group}} of 1-benzylimidazole-5-acetic acid derivatives. S-8307 and S-8308 have moderate potency, short duration of action and limited oral bioavailability, however they are selective and competitive AT1 receptor antagonists without partial agonist activity. A group at DuPont postulated that both Ang II and the Takeda leads were bound at the same <b>receptor</b> <b>site.</b> These two substances served as lead compounds for further optimization of AT1 receptor blockers.|$|E
25|$|LA drugs act {{mainly by}} {{inhibiting}} sodium influx through sodium-specific ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane, {{in particular the}} so-called voltage-gated sodium channels. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is inhibited. The <b>receptor</b> <b>site</b> {{is thought to be}} located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Local anesthetic drugs bind more readily to sodium channels in an activated state, thus onset of neuronal blockade is faster in rapidly firing neurons. This is referred to as state-dependent blockade.|$|E
500|$|Grasshoppers have {{a typical}} insect nervous system, {{and have an}} {{extensive}} set of external sense organs. On {{the side of the}} head are a pair of large compound eyes which give a broad field of vision and can detect movement, shape, colour and distance. There are also three simple eyes (ocelli) on the forehead which can detect light intensity, a pair of antennae containing olfactory (smell) and touch receptors, and mouthparts containing gustatory (taste) receptors. At the front end of the abdomen there is a pair of tympanal organs for sound reception. There are numerous fine hairs (setae) covering the whole body that act as mechanoreceptors (touch and wind sensors), and these are most dense on the antennae, the palps (part of the mouth), and on the cerci at the tip of the abdomen. There are special receptors (campaniform sensillae) embedded in the cuticle of the legs that sense pressure and cuticle distortion. There are internal [...] "chordotonal" [...] sense organs specialized to detect position and movement about the joints of the exoskeleton. The receptors convey information to the central nervous system through sensory neurons, and most of these have their cell bodies located in the periphery near the <b>receptor</b> <b>site</b> itself.|$|E
40|$|The {{adhesion}} of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain O(PA 0) {{to human}} buccal epithelial cells (BECs) was analysed by an equilibrium analysis of binding and the equilibrium parameters of adhesion determined. P A 0 bound {{to a maximum}} of 159 f 28 <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> per BEC with an apparent association constant (Ka) of 2. 89 (f 1. 76) x lo- * ml/CFU. As P. aeruginosa strain K(PAK) employs pili to adhere to BECs and there is substantial homology between the PAK pilin gene and the P A 0 pilin gene, the potential for competition for <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> on the BEC surface was investigated.

25|$|Benzodiazepine {{treatment}} {{should be}} discontinued {{as soon as}} possible by a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen. Tolerance develops to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines; for example tolerance occurs to the anticonvulsant effects and as a result benzodiazepines are not generally recommended for the long-term management of epilepsy. Dose increases may overcome the effects of tolerance, but tolerance may then develop to the higher dose and adverse effects may increase. The mechanism of tolerance to benzodiazepines includes uncoupling of <b>receptor</b> <b>sites,</b> alterations in gene expression, down-regulation of <b>receptor</b> <b>sites,</b> and desensitisation of <b>receptor</b> <b>sites</b> to the effect of GABA. About one-third of individuals who take benzodiazepines for longer than four weeks become dependent and experience withdrawal syndrome on cessation.|$|R

2500|$|Excitotoxicity may be {{involved}} in spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury, hearing loss (through noise overexposure or ototoxicity), and in neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, alcoholism or alcohol withdrawal and especially over-rapid benzodiazepine withdrawal, and also Huntington's disease. Other common conditions that cause excessive glutamate concentrations around neurons are hypoglycemia. Blood sugars are the primary glutamate removal method from inter-synaptic spaces at the NMDA and AMPA <b>receptor</b> <b>site.</b> Persons in excitotoxic shock must never fall into hypoglycemia. Patients should be given 5% glucose (dextrose) IV drip during excitotoxic shock to avoid a dangerous build up of glutamate around NMDA and AMPA neurons. When 5% glucose (dextrose) IV drip is not available high levels of fructose are given orally. Treatment is administered during the acute stages of excitotoxic shock along with glutamate antagonists.

5000|$|Catterall et al. {{hypothesized}} that some polypeptide neurotoxins that modify voltage-gated channels function via a [...] "voltage-sensor trapping" [...] mechanism. The hypothesis states that neurotoxins similar to poneratoxin, such as alpha-scorpion toxins, act upon sodium channels via binding to the channels' <b>receptor</b> <b>site</b> 3, which normally affects the channels' ability to inactivate. Therefore, <b>receptor</b> <b>site</b> 3 neurotoxins often affect sodium channels by slowing or blocking inactivation. Normally, {{the region of}} the channel where neurotoxin <b>receptor</b> <b>site</b> 3 is undergoes a conformational change of an outward movement to lead to inactivation. <b>Receptor</b> <b>site</b> 3 neurotoxins are proposed to prevent this conformational change via interaction with acidic and hydrophobic amino acid residues at that site.|$|E
