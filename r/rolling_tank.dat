40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this paper}} is to present and {{validate}} a modeling framework that can be used for simulation of industrial applications involving fluid structure interaction with large deformations. Background Fluid structure interaction phenomena involving elastic structures frequently occur in industrial applications such as rubber bushings filled with oil, the filling of liquid in a paperboard package or a fiber suspension flowing through a paper machine. Simulations of such phenomena are challenging due to the strong coupling between the fluid and the elastic structure. In the literature, this coupling is often achieved with an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian framework or with smooth particle hydrodynamics methods. In the present work, an immersed boundary method is used to couple a finite volume based Navier-Stokes solver with a finite element based structural mechanics solver for large deformations. Results The benchmark of an elastic rubber beam in a <b>rolling</b> <b>tank</b> partially filled with oil is simulated. The simulations are compared to experimental data as well as numerical simulations published in the literature. 2 D simulations performed in the present work agree well with previously published data. Our 3 D simulations capture effects neglected in the 2 D case, showing excellent agreement with previously published experiments. Conclusions The good agreement with experimental data shows that the developed framework is suitable for simulation of industrial applications involving fluid structure interaction. If the structure is made of a highly elastic material, e. g. rubber, the simulation framework must be able to handle the large deformations that may occur. Immersed boundary methods are well suited for such applications, since they can efficiently handle moving objects without the need of a body-fitted mesh. Combining them with a structural mechanics solver for large deformations allows complex fluid structure interaction problems to be studied...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCorrelation between {{particulate}} {{organic carbon}} (POC) and calcium carbonate sinking through the deep ocean {{has led to the}} idea that ballast provided by calcium carbonate is important for the export of POC from the surface ocean. While this idea is certainly to some extent true, it is worth considering in more nuance, for example, examining the different effects on the aggregation and sinking of POC of small, non-sinking calcite particles like coccoliths and large, rapidly sinking calcite like planktonic foraminiferan tests. We have done that here in a simple experiment carried out in roller tanks that allow particles to sink continuously without being impeded by container walls. Coccoliths were efficiently incorporated into aggregates that formed during the experiment, increasing their sinking speed compared to similarly sized aggregates lacking added calcite ballast. The foraminiferan tests, which sank as fast as 700 md− 1, became associated with only very minor amounts of POC. In addition, when they collided with other, larger, foram-less aggregates, they fragmented them into two smaller, more slowly sinking aggregates. While these effects were certainly exaggerated {{within the confines of the}} <b>rolling</b> <b>tanks,</b> they clearly demonstrate that calcium carbonate ballast is not just calcium carbonate ballast - different forms of calcium carbonate ballast have notably different effects on POC aggregation, sinking, and export...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCorrelations of {{particulate}} {{organic carbon}} (POC) and mineral fluxes into sediment traps in the deep sea have previously suggested that interactions between organic matter and minerals {{play a key role}} in organic matter flux to the deep. Here experiments were carried out in <b>rolling</b> <b>tanks</b> to observe the incorporation of suspended biogenic minerals (calcium carbonate coccoliths or silica diatom frustules) into diatom aggregates and examine their influence on aggregate character. Addition of higher concentrations of suspended minerals to tanks resulted in a decrease in aggregate volume and mass and in an increase in aggregate number. POC to dry weight ratios also declined as mineral concentrations increased, saturating at 2 - 5 weight percent POC. Large amounts of suspended particulate material, consisting of miniscule aggregates of both inorganic material and organic matter, formed during the experiments. This suggested sizable scavenging of dissolved organic matter into the particulate phase during the experiment in general, and in particular associated with the presence of suspended minerals. Some of the increase in particulate inorganic matter may have been tied to cation crosslinking of the polymerized organic matter. The C to N ratio of this scavenged material was lower in the opal experiments than in the calcium carbonate experiments, suggesting differences in the compounds being formed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo address {{whether the}} {{incorporation}} of suspended minerals drives the sedimentation of particulate organic carbon in the ocean or vice versa, incubations of phytoplankton-detritus aggregates were set up in <b>rolling</b> <b>tanks</b> containing seawater and suspended clay (illite) or calcium carbonate at concentrations ranging between 10 and 50, 000 mu g L- 1. The suspended minerals were efficiently scavenged by and incorporated into the organic aggregates. The volume and porosity of aggregates decreased with increasing mineral concentrations, and at suspended mineral concentrations higher than 500 mu g L- 1 the initially medium-sized aggregates were fragmented into thousands of tiny, dense aggregates. Because radius and density have opposite effects on aggregate sinking rates, the relationship between aggregate particulate organic carbon (POC) to mineral ratio and sinking rate is not a straightforward one that necessarily results in higher sinking rates with increased mineral content. In these experiments the saturating capacity of organic aggregates for mineral particles appeared to be 97 to 98 weight-percent mineral (i. e., a POC to dry weight ratio of 0. 02 to 0. 03 mu g C mu g(- 1)). This parallels the values of 0. 05 mu g C mu g(- 1) observed for sinking particles in the deep sea and {{suggests that it is}} the flux of POC that determines the flux of minerals to the deep and not the other way around...|$|R

40|$|Phytoplankton spring blooms {{dominated}} by diatoms and often by Thalassiosira rotula and/or Skeletonema costatum are typical features of coastal seas in the temperate zone. They are usually terminated by nutrient limitation, aggregation and sedimentation events. In {{the course of}} climate change increasing temperatures in spring may affect the development of diatom blooms and in particular aggregation, {{a process in which}} heterotrophic bacteria play an active role. As heterotrophic microbial processes are favoured more relative to autotrophic processes by increasing temperature, we hypothesize that aggregation will be enhanced with increasing temperature and in particular {{towards the end of the}} spring bloom with increasing senescence of the diatoms. To test this hypothesis we examined aggregation in the course of a spring bloom in a mesocosm experiment in the southern North Sea at the in situ temperature of 6 °C and at 11 °C. Water was transferred to a mesocosm of 720 liter and incubated at the in situ temperature and a 12 : 12 h light-dark cycle for 3 weeks. Aggregation was assessed in the pre-bloom, bloom and late bloom phase by measuring the formation of aggregates in subsamples incubated for 48 h in <b>rolling</b> <b>tanks</b> at 6 °C and 11 °C in a 12 : 12 h light-dark cycle. Aggregation was determined in subsamples withdrawn directly from the mesocosm and in subsamples to which axenic T. rotula cells were added in a concentration of ca. 5000 cells ml- 1. Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP), dissolved organic carbon and dissolved carbohydrate as well as the bacterial abundance and community composition by DGGE and FISH were analysed during the bloom and the aggregation experiments. The addition of T. rotula enhanced aggregation relative to the untreated samples. For the latter, aggregation was rather independent of temperature whereas aggregation was enhanced at the higher temperature when T. rotula was added and in particular towards the end of the bloom. The results suggest that increasing temperature enhances aggregation of phytoplankton spring blooms {{dominated by}} T. rotula. This enhanced aggregation may have implications for the trophic transfer of diatom blooms in the food web by reducing the available amount of diatom-derived organic matter to zooplankton...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{industrial}} revolution, the ocean has absorbed around {{one third of}} the anthropogenic CO 2, which induced a profound alteration of the carbonate system commonly known as ocean acidification. Since the preindustrial times, the average ocean surface water pH has fallen by 0. 1 units, from approximately 8. 2 to 8. 1 and a further decrease of 0. 4 pH units is expected {{for the end of the}} century. Despite their microscopic size, marine diatoms are bio-geo-chemically a very important group, responsible for the export of massive amount of carbon to deep waters and sediments. The knowledge of the potential effects of ocean acidification on the phytoplankton growth and on biological pump is still at its infancy. This study wants to investigate the effect of ocean acidification on the growth of the diatom Skeletonema marinoi and on its aggregation, using a mechanistic approach. The experiment consisted of two treatments (Present and Future) representing different pCO 2 conditions and two sequential experimental phases. During the cell growth phase a culture of S. marinoi was inoculated into transparent bags and the effect of ocean acidification was studied on various growth parameters, including DOC and TEP production. The aggregation phase consisted in the incubation of the cultures into <b>rolling</b> <b>tanks</b> where the sinking of particles through the water column was simulated and aggregation promoted. Since few studies investigated the effect of pH on the growth of S. marinoi and none used pH ranges that are compatible with the OA scenarios, there were no baselines. I have shown here, that OA does not affect the cell growth of S. marinoi, suggesting that the physiology of this species is robust in respect to the changes in the carbonate chemistry expected for the end of the century. Furthermore, according to my results, OA does not affect the aggregation of S. marinoi in a consistent manner, suggesting that this process has a high natural variability but is not influenced by OA in a predictable way. The effect of OA was tested over a variety of factors including the number of aggregates produced, their size and sinking velocity, the algal, bacterial and TEP content. Many of these variables showed significant treatment effects but none of these were consistent between the two experiments...|$|R
