40|$|Surface texture {{analysis}} {{applied to}} high-resolution digital terrain models (HRDTMs) is a promising approach for extracting useful fine-scale morphological information. Surface roughness, considered {{here as a}} synonym of surface texture, can have a discriminant role in the detection of different geomorphic processes and factors. Very often, the local morphology presents, at different scales, anisotropic characteristics that could {{be taken into account}} when calculating or measuring surface roughness. The high morphological detail of HRDTMs permits the description of different aspects of surface roughness, beyond an evaluation limited to isotropic measures of surface roughness. The generalization of the concept of roughness implies the need to refer to a family of specific <b>roughness</b> <b>indices</b> capable of capturing specific multiscale and anisotropic aspects of surface morphology. An interesting set of <b>roughness</b> <b>indices</b> is represented by directional measures of roughness that can be meaningful in the context of analyzed and modeled flow processes. Accordingly, we test the application of a flow-oriented directional measure of roughness based on the geostatistical bivariate index MAD (median of absolute directional differences), which is computed considering surface gravity-driven flow direction. MAD is derived from a modification of a variogram and is specifically designed for the geomorphometric analysis of HRDTMs. The presented approach shows the potential impact of considering directionality in the calculation of <b>roughness</b> <b>indices.</b> The results demonstrate that the use of flow-directional roughness can improve geomorphometric modeling (e. g., sediment connectivity and surface texture modeling) and the interpretation of landscape morphology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper quantitatively explores, {{in terms}} of rough-ness indices, the effect of soil surface {{irregularities}} on the diurnal variation of the broadband blue-sky albedo of a large range of soil properties. Field {{studies were carried out}} on cultivated and uncul-tivated soil surfaces in Poland and Israel that vary in roughness and brightness. It was found that these irregularities, formed by differ-ent agricultural equipment and modified by rain or sprinkler irrigation, can be quantified by two <b>roughness</b> <b>indices.</b> Soil rough-ness not only affects the overall level of the diurnal variation of the albedo, but also affects the intensity of the diurnal increase from the solar zenith angle (µ) at the local noon to about 75 80. The <b>roughness</b> <b>indices</b> are variables that precisely determine only the albedo at the local solar noon of soils with the same color value. If the contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) and calciumcarbonate are treated as the dominant variables, combinedwith one of the indices, these three variables together would significantly describe the albedo at the local solar noon of all soil surfaces. The soils, with their high irregularities, showed almost no rising values of albedo at a µ lower than 75, while the smooth soil surfaces exhibited a gradual increase of the albedo at these angles. It is concluded that the <b>roughness</b> <b>indices</b> provide sufficient means to accurately describe the diurnal variation of the albedo {{of a wide range of}} surfaces, disregarding other soil properties.

40|$|This work {{develops}} a fully automatic photogrammetric approach for measuring soil surface roughness from pictures {{taken in the}} field with a simple digital camera, without geometric constraints. On each site, 13 overlapping photographs of the soil surface were taken from different angles, {{under the shade of}} an umbrella. Millimeter accuracy 3 D soil models were calculated from these pictures and were used to derive 11 <b>roughness</b> <b>indexes.</b> The whole procedure was implemented in a fully automatic Python program. The system accuracy was determined on artificial models built with polystyrene, the positional and elevation accuracies of which were about 1. 5 mm, while the error on the surface area estimation was less than 0. 76 % of the site surface area. This approach was successfully applied to an agricultural field experiment in which four soil tillage levels have been generated. These levels were correctly identified using two indices for 96 % of the 32 measurement sites.

40|$|Abstract—Pavement surface {{unevenness}} plays {{a pivotal}} role on <b>roughness</b> <b>index</b> of road which affects on riding comfort ability. Comfort ability refers {{to the degree of}} protection offered to vehicle occupants from uneven elements in the road surface. So, it is preferable to have a lower <b>roughness</b> <b>index</b> value for a better riding quality of road users. Roughness is generally defined as an expression of irregularities in the pavement surface which can be measured using different equipments like MERLIN, Bump integrator, Profilometer etc. Among them Bump Integrator is quite simple and less time consuming in case of long road sections. A case study is conducted on low volume roads in West District in Tripura to determine <b>roughness</b> <b>index</b> (RI) using Bump Integrator at the standard speed of 32 km/h. But it becomes too tough to maintain the requisite standard speed throughout the road section. The speed of Bump Integrator (BI) has to lower or higher in some distinctive situations.

40|$|International {{audience}} 3 D meshes {{are subject}} to various visual distortions during their transmission and geometrical processing. Several works have tried to evaluate the visual quality using either full reference or reduced reference approaches. However, these approaches require {{the presence of the}} reference mesh which is not available in such practical situations. In this paper, the main contribution lies in the design of a computational method to automatically predict the perceived mesh quality without reference and without knowing beforehand the distortion type. Following the no-reference (NR) quality assessment principle, the proposed method focuses only on the distorted mesh. Specifically, the dihedral angles are firstly computed as a surface <b>roughness</b> <b>indexes</b> and so a structural information descriptors. Then, a visual masking modulation is applied to this angles according to the main characteristics of the human visual system. The well known statistical Gamma model is used to fit the dihedral angles distribution.

40|$|The {{decay of}} {{roughness}} {{is an important}} factor governing surface processes such as infiltration and soil erosion. Thus the decay of surface roughness under different surface conditions was investigated and related to quantitative amounts of soil loss, runoff and sediment concentration in a laboratory experiment. Rainfall with an intensity of 128 mm/h was applied to a bare or mulched surfaces of a sandy loam soil with known surface roughness at specified time intervals. The decay of roughness as expressed by roughness ratio, in this experiment, was better predicted when related to an exponential function of the square root of cumulative kinetic energy of rainfall rather than with the cumulative rainfall. The roughness decay equations in literature did not predict breakdown under mulched surfaces accurately. Thus the exponent parameters of the roughness decay equations were adjusted to reflect the reduced decay occurring under mulched surfaces. In a bare soil, regression equations expressing the dependent variables as a function of initial <b>roughness</b> <b>index</b> were significant, but with low coefficients of determination, being 0. 39 for soil loss, 0. 12 for runoff and 0. 36 for sediment concentration. In addition to initial <b>roughness</b> <b>index,</b> cumulative kinetic energy of rainfall was further included in the regressions. This led to an increase in coefficients of determination, which was 0. 81 for soil loss, 0. 74 for runoff and 0. 49 for sediment concentration. The coefficients of determination (0. 87 for soil loss, 0. 85 for runoff and 0. 51 for sediment concentration) were further increased when the final <b>roughness</b> <b>index</b> was included in addition to initial <b>roughness</b> <b>index</b> and cumulative kinetic energy in the regressions.

40|$|The {{apparent}} {{shear strength}} of rock discontinuities is considerably {{smaller than that}} of small scale samples. At the same time, the sliding behavior is characterized, in situ, by marked instabilities, with the typical features of Critical Phenomena. Contact mechanics permits to calculate normal and tangential forces at any point, and to follow the stick-slip transition for arbitrary loading histories. On the other hand, the above aspects are not captured by the classical theories, including those based on <b>roughness</b> <b>indices.</b> We argue that the multiscale topology of contact domains plays {{a fundamental role in}} determining the behavior of rock joints. In particular, experiments and numerical simulations show that these domains are lacunar sets with fractal dimension smaller than 2. 0. This provides peculiar scaling of normal and tangential pressures at the interface, and the consequent size-dependence of the apparent friction coefficient. Moreover, we implement Renormalization Group to determine the critical point (e. g. the critical shear force) when rock sliding occurs. We show that the critical force is less than the one predicted by the classical Coulomb's theory, and that it depends on the specimen size and on the topology of the interface. The same reasoning can be extended to other phenomena, e. g., to the rupture of brittle materials...|$|R
