25|$|Transmissions {{normally}} involve two shift registers of some given word size, such {{as eight}} bits, {{one in the}} master {{and one in the}} slave; they are connected in a virtual <b>ring</b> <b>topology.</b> Data is usually shifted out with the most-significant bit first, while shifting a new least-significant bit into the same register. At the same time, Data from the counterpart is shifted into the least-significant bit register. After the register bits have been shifted out and in, the master and slave have exchanged register values. If more data needs to be exchanged, the shift registers are reloaded and the process repeats. Transmission may continue for any number of clock cycles. When complete, the master stops toggling the clock signal, and typically deselects the slave.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Chains of {{totally bounded}} topologies on abelian groups were studied in [1], [2], [3]. The problem of {{description}} of the lattice of all precompact <b>ring</b> <b>topologies</b> on a <b>ring</b> R is connected with the Bohr compactification of the ring (R, Td), where Td is the discrete topology on R (see, [1]). The Bohr compactification of the ring (Z, Td) is described in [1] (Theorem 6. 14). We will study in this paper the lattice P(R) of all precompact <b>ring</b> <b>topologies</b> on a <b>ring</b> R. We focus our attention on some concrete rings: i) the ring Fm 2, where m is some cardinal; ii) the ring P(X) of polynomials with integer coefficients over a set X; iii) the free ring F(X) with identity generated by a set X. Notation and conventions All ring {{are assumed to be}} associative. Topological rings are not necessarily Hausdorff. We will say that a ring R has a finite characteristic if there exists m∈ such that mx = 0 for every x∈R. The minimal number m with the given property is called the characteristic of R. Denote for a given ring R by P(R) the lattice of all precompact <b>ring</b> <b>topologies</b> on R. A subgroup H of a group G is called cofinite provided there exists a finite subset F such that G=F⋅H. The Bohr compactification of a topological ring (R, T) is denoted by b(R, T) (see, e. g.,[1]). If α, β are two ordinal numbers, α < β, then [α, β) = { γ | α≤γ<β}. For any ordinal number α the symbol |α | stands for the cardinality of α...|$|R

40|$|Current {{means of}} {{providing}} loop-back recovery, which {{is widely used}} in SONET, rely on <b>ring</b> <b>topologies,</b> or on overlaying logical <b>ring</b> <b>topologies</b> upon physical meshes. Loop-back is desirable to provide rapid preplanned recovery of link or node failures in a bandwidth-efficient distributed manner. We introduce generalized loop-back, a novel scheme for performing loop-back in optical mesh networks. We present an algorithm to perform recovery for link failure and one to perform generalized loop-back recovery for node failure. We illustrate the operation of both algorithms, prove their validity, and present a network management protocol algorithm, which enables distributed operation for link or node failure. We present three different applications of generalized loop-back. First, we present heuristic algorithms for selecting recovery graphs, which maintain short maximum and average lengths of recovery paths. Second, we present WDM-based loop-back recovery for optical networks where wavelengths are used to back up other wavelengths. We compare, for WDM-based loop-back, the operation of generalized loop-back operation with known ring-based ways of providing loop-back recovery over mesh networks. Finally, we introduce the use of generalized loop-back to provide recovery {{in a way that}} allows dynamic choice of routes over preplanned directions...|$|R
