For mixed layer, 0 - 400 -m layer and 400 -m level trajectories, sensitivity to combined increases in both spatial and temporal rawinsonde data resolution was dominated by the effects of spatial resolution alone.

On the basis of synoptic and mesoscale analyses, it is concluded that the gravity current might have originated either as a scale-contracted cold front or as a gust front resulting from thunderstorm outflows observed very near the leading edge of a cold front. Despite this ambiguity, the detailed vertical structure of the gravity current itself is well resolved from the data. Moreover, the vertical velocity measurements provided by the sodars and the radar wind profiler at high time resolution have given unique information about the height structure of gravity waves excited by the gravity current. Although only wave periods, and not phase speeds or wavelengths, are directly measured, it is possible to make reasonable inferences about wave excitation mechanisms and about the influence and control of ambient stratification on wave-field characteristics. Both Kelvin-Helmholtz waves generated in the regions of high wind shear found in association with the gravity current and lee-type waves forced by the gravity current acting as an obstacle to opposing prefrontal flow are identified. It is also found that the propagation speed of the gravity current and the relative depths of the prefrontal inversion and the postfrontal cold air were not favorable for the formation of either internal bores or solitary waves at the time of day at which the gravity current was being observed...|$|E

NCEP–NCAR reanalysis (NNR) and ECMWF 15 / 40 -Yr Re-Analysis (ERA- 15 and ERA- 40) variables are compared to two independent rawinsonde datasets from {{the periphery of the}} Arctic Ocean during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s: the Coordinated Eastern Arctic Research Experiment (CEAREX) and the Lead Experiment (LeadEx). The study is prompted by J. A. Francis who found that the NNR and ERA- 15 upper-level winds are very different from those observed during these two field experiments. All three reanalyses display large biases in comparisons of the wind components and wind speeds with CEAREX observations, particularly above the 500 -hPa level, but exhibit smaller discrepancies with respect to the LeadEx data, generally consistent with the previous findings of J. A. Francis. However, all three reanalyses well capture the wind variability during both experiment periods. For the geopotential height, temperature, and moisture fields, the reanalyses demonstrate close agreement with the CEAREX rawin-sonde observations. From comparisons with surrounding fixed <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>stations</b> and examination of the average vertical wind speed shear, it is concluded that the CEAREX upper-level wind speeds (especially above the 500 -hPa level) are erroneous and average about half of the actual values.

40|$|Upper tropospheric {{and lower}} stratospheric wind data {{spanning}} 31 years from 1964 to 1994 were analyzed at <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>stations</b> in the central/western Pacific. Traditional spectral and cross-spectral analysis {{led to the}} conclusion that there is a significant signal with periods between 3 and 4. 5 days, which the authors link with the dominant antisymmetric waves predicted by theory to have these periods, mixed Rossby–gravity waves, and equatorial Rossby waves. Then the authors applied the seasonally varying spectral analysis method developed by Madden to study the average seasonal variation of these waves. The seasonally varying analysis suggested that there are significant twice-yearly maxima in equatorial wave activity throughout the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, with peaks occurring in late winter–spring and in late summer–fall. The twice-yearly signal was most prominent at the 70 -hPa and 100 -hPa levels. Similar and consistent results were also shown by an autoregressive cyclic spectral analysis. The cyclic spectral analysis suggested that the frequency characteristics of the �-wind wave power are different during the two maxima at some stations. In addition, the seasonally varying squared coherence between the u and � winds and the associated phase implied that there is horizontal momentum flux associated with these waves and that the sign of the flux is different during the two maxima. The differences in wave characteristics during the maxima periods may be related to different wave modes, seasonal variation of the basic zonal state, or possibly to different equatorial wave forcing mechanisms (i. e., convective versus lateral excitations). 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{frictional}} {{and thermal}} contributions to Sz 212 (p), the dominant wave {{type in the}} progressive solar semidiurnal pressure wave, are evaluated from upper air observations at nine <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>stations.</b> The theoretical basis for the investigation follows from the approximation of friction as a potential force in the tidal equations. The model parameters and boundary conditions are those adopted by Siebert. Surface friction is evaluated semi-empirically, {{by the use of}} a friction model which is essentially an adaptation] to the semidiurnal motions, of the Ekman theory of the boundary layer. The assumption of a constant coefficient of the vertical transfer of momentum leads to uncertainties in the magnitude of the frictional contribution to the wave. Further uncertainties arise from a systematic error in the observed temperatures, caused by radiation effects on the radiosonde instrument. The latter error, however, is believed to be negligible in the lower troposphere, where an unexpectedly large temperature variation is apparently caused by eddy transfer of heat from the earth’s surface. The results of the study must be considered {{in the light of the}} probable errors arising from data sampling, from the diurnal bias in the radiosonde observations, and from the restrictive assumptions of the theory. Considered in this light, the results suggest that the semidiurnal oscillation may be explained by three processes, of approximately equal importance: (1) eddy transfer of heat from the earth’s surface; (2) direct absorption of solar radiation by water vapor and ozone, as computed by Siebert; and (3) surface friction, or eddy transfer of momentum. Surface friction apparently delays the surface pressure oscillation by about one hour. I...|$|R
40|$|Past {{attempts}} to assimilate precipitation by nudging or variational methods {{have succeeded in}} forcing the model precipitation {{to be close to}} the observed values. However, the model forecasts tend to lose their additional skill after a few forecast hours. In this study, a local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) is used to effectively assimilate precipitation by allowing ensemble members with better precipitation to receive higher weights in the analysis. In addition, two other changes in the precipitation assimilation process are found to alleviate the problems related to the non-Gaussianity of the precipitation variable: (a) transform the precipitation variable into a Gaussian distribution based on its climatological distribution (an approach that could also be used in the assimilation of other non-Gaussian observations) and (b) only assimilate precipitation at the location where at least some ensemble members have precipitation. Unlike many current approaches, both positive and zero rain observations are assimilated effectively. Observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are conducted using the Simplified Parametrisations, primitivE-Equation DYnamics (SPEEDY) model, a simplified but realistic general circulation model. When uniformly and globally distributed observations of precipitation are assimilated in addition to rawinsonde observations, both the analyses and the medium-range forecasts of all model variables, including precipitation, are significantly improved as compared to only assimilating rawinsonde observations. The effect of precipitation assimilation on the analyses is retained on the medium-range forecasts and is larger in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) than that in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) because the NH analyses are already made more accurate by the denser <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>stations.</b> These improvements are much reduced when only the moisture field is modified by the precipitation observations. Both the Gaussian transformation and the new observation selection criterion are shown to be beneficial to the precipitation assimilation {{especially in the case of}} larger observation errors.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of two statistical downscaling methods for daily maximum and minimum surface air temperature, total daily precipitation and total monthly precipitation at Indianapolis, IN, USA, is presented. The analysis is conducted for two seasons, {{the growing season}} and the non-growing season, defined based on variability of surface air temperature. The predictors used in the downscaling are indices of the synoptic scale circulation derived from rotated principal components analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis of variables extracted from an 18 -year record from seven <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>stations</b> in the Midwest region of the United States. PCA yielded seven significant components for the growing season and five significant components for the non-growing season. These PCs explained 86 % and 83 % of the original rawinsonde data for the growing and non-growing seasons, respectively. Cluster analysis of the PC scores using the average linkage method resulted in eight growing season synoptic types and twelve non-growing synoptic types. The downscaling of temperature and precipitation is conducted using PC scores and cluster frequencies in regression models and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Regression models and ANNs yielded similar results, but the data for each regression model violated {{at least one of}} the assumptions of regression analysis. As expected, the accuracy of the downscaling models for temperature was superior to that for precipitation. The accuracy of all temperature models was improved by adding an autoregressive term, which also changed the relative importance of the dominant anomaly patterns as manifest in the PC scores. Application of the transfer functions to model daily maximum and minimum temperature data from an independent time series resulted in correlation coefficients of 0. 34 – 0. 89. In accord with previous studies, the precipitation models exhibited lesser predictive capabilities. The correlation coefficient for predicted versus observed daily precipitation totals was less than 0. 5 for both seasons, while that for monthly total precipitation was below 0. 65.

Relative to operational forecasts, the forecast from the ensemble-mean analysis has slightly larger errors in wind and temperature but smaller errors in moisture, even though satellite radiances are not assimilated by the EnKF. Time-averaged correlations indicate that assimilating ACARS and cloud wind data with flow-dependent error statistics provides corrections to the moisture field {{in the absence of}} direct observations of that field. Comparison with a control experiment in which a deterministic forecast is cycled without observation assimilation indicates that the skill in the EnKF’s forecasts results from assimilating observations and not from lateral boundary conditions or the model formulation.

The composite soundings were delivered to the National Weather Service (NWS) Melbourne (MLB) office for display using the National version of the Skew-T Hodograph analysis and Research Program (NSHARP) software program. The NWS MLB requested the AMU make the composite soundings available for display in the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS), so they could be overlaid on current observed soundings. This will allow the forecasters to compare {{the current state of the}} atmosphere with climatology. This presentation describes how the AMU converted the composite soundings from NSHARP Archive format to Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) format, so that the soundings could be displayed in AWl PS. The NetCDF is a set of data formats, programming interfaces, and software libraries used to read and write scientific data files. In AWIPS, each meteorological data type, such as soundings or surface observations, has a unique NetCDF format. Each format is described by a NetCDF template file. Although NetCDF files are in binary format, they can be converted to a text format called network Common data form Description Language (CDL). A software utility called ncgen is used to create a NetCDF file from a CDL file, while the ncdump utility is used to create a CDL file from a NetCDF file. An AWIPS receives soundings in Binary Universal Form for the Representation of Meteorological data (BUFR) format ([URL] and then decodes them into NetCDF format. Only two sounding files are generated in AWIPS per day. One file contains all of the soundings received worldwide between 0000 UTC and 1200 UTC, and the other includes all soundings between 1200 UTC and 0000 UTC. In order to add the composite soundings into AWIPS, a procedure was created to configure, or localize, AWIPS. This involved modifying and creating several configuration text files. A unique fourcharacter site identifier was created for each of the 32 soundings so each could be viewed separately. The first three characters were based on the site identifier of the observed sounding, while the last character was based on the flow regime. While researching the localization process for soundings, the AMU discovered a method of archiving soundings so old soundings would not get purged automatically by AWl PS. This method could provide an alternative way of localizing AWl PS for composite soundings. In addition, this would allow forecasters to use archived soundings in AWIPS for case studies. A test sounding file in NetCDF format was written in order to verify the correct format for soundings in AWIPS. After the file was viewed successfully in AWIPS, the AMU wrote a software program in the Tool Command Language/Tool Kit (Tcl/Tk) language to convert the 32 composite soundings from NSHARP Archive to CDL format. The ncgen utility was then used to convert the CDL file to a NetCDF file. The NetCDF file could then be read and displayed in AWIPS...|$|R
