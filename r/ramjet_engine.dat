5|$|Johnson {{wanted to}} power the Q-12 with a <b>ramjet</b> <b>engine</b> built by the Marquardt Corporation for the Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc {{long-range}} surface-to-air missile. Marquardt and Lockheed had already collaborated on several programs and had a close working relationship. The engine, the RJ43-MA-11, required modification, since it was only designed to burn {{as long as the}} missile needed to hit a target, while the Q-12's engine needed to operate at high temperatures {{for at least an hour}} and a half at high altitudes. The modified engine was designated RJ43-MA20S-4.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} to this problem is the removal of the turbine. The <b>ramjet</b> <b>engine</b> consists mostly of a large tube, and is relatively easy to air-cool by forcing extra air around the engine. Experimental ramjet aircraft of the era, like the Lockheed X-7, were reaching speeds as high as Mach4. There are numerous problems with the <b>ramjet</b> <b>engine,</b> however. Fuel economy, or thrust specific fuel consumption in aircraft terms, is extremely poor. This makes general operations like flying from one airbase to another expensive propositions. More problematic is the fact that ramjets rely on forward speed to compress the incoming air, and become efficient above Mach1.|$|E

25|$|June 1959: The Land panel {{provisionally}} selects the A-11 over FISH, instructing {{both companies}} to re-design their aircraft. In July, the Land panel rejected both the Convair and Lockheed proposals. The Convair FISH used unproven <b>ramjet</b> <b>engine</b> technology {{and would be}} launched from a modified B-58B Hustler which was canceled in June. The susceptibility of the A-11 to radar detection was considered too great. On 20 August, both firms provided specifications for their revised proposals.|$|E
25|$|The Gorgon V {{project was}} begun in 1950 {{to develop an}} air-to-surface missile capable of {{dispersing}} chemical warfare agents over a combat area. Designing of the missile was contracted to the Glenn L. Martin Company, which used the company's earlier PTV-N-2 Gorgon IV ramjet test missile {{as a basis for}} the weapon's design. The Gorgon V was to be a long slender missile, with swept wings and conventional tail. The Gorgon IV's <b>ramjet</b> <b>engine,</b> slung beneath the missile's tail, was replaced in the Gorgon V with a X14A aerosol generator, developed by the Edo Aircraft Corporation.|$|E
25|$|A Pratt & Whitney J52-P-3 {{turbojet}} propelled the Hound Dog, {{instead of}} Navaho's <b>ramjet</b> <b>engine.</b> The J52 engine {{was located in}} a pod located beneath the rear fuselage, giving it an appearance similar to the Lockheed X-7 high-speed experimental drone. The J52-P-3 used in the Hound Dog, unlike J52s installed in aircraft like the A-4 Skyhawk or the A-6 Intruder, was optimized to run at maximum power during the missile's flight. As a result, the Hound Dog's version of the J52 had a short operating lifetime of only six hours. However, in combat, the Hound Dog was expected to self-destruct in less than six hours.|$|E

25|$|The Škoda-Kauba Aircraft Industries, {{located in}} a suburb of Nazi-occupied Prague, {{designed}} the Sk P.14 as a single-seat monoplane powered by a Sänger <b>ramjet</b> <b>engine.</b> Since the ramjet had a diameter of 1.5 m and a length of 9.5 m, the massive engine and its tubular air-intake duct formed most of the fuselage structure. The cockpit had the pilot flying the aircraft in a prone position. Its landing gear was a retractable skid. In order to bring the ramjet to a speed where it would work, take off was by means of booster rockets fitted to a three-wheel detachable dolly. Only parts of the aircraft had been built when the project was terminated.|$|E
2500|$|Even as {{testing of}} RARE was undertaken, the Naval Air Missile Test Center was {{developing}} their own test vehicle. Known as CROW, or Creative Research on Weapons, the NAMTC vehicle was intended to demonstrate that a solid-fueled rocket-ramjet was capable of delivering a reasonable payload. [...] A simple unguided rocket, the first Crow vehicle, known as Crow I, was intended for aerial launch at low supersonic speed and an altitude of [...] [...] After launch, the booster acted as an ordinary solid-fueled rocket; however upon burnout of the booster stage, the rocket's casing acted as the duct for a <b>ramjet</b> <b>engine,</b> with remaining solid fuel being mixed with the incoming air to provide thrust.|$|E

50|$|In the Soviet Union, {{a theory}} of {{supersonic}} <b>ramjet</b> <b>engines</b> was presented in 1928 by Boris Stechkin.

Merkulov and tested in April 1933. To simulate supersonic flight, it was fed by air compressed to , and was fueled with hydrogen. The GIRD-08 phosphorus-fueled ramjet was tested by firing it from an artillery cannon. These shells may have been the first jet-powered projectiles to break the speed of sound.|$|R

40|$|An inlet {{concept for}} {{separate}} turbojet and <b>ramjet</b> <b>engines</b> was defined and {{compared with an}} equivalent inlet for a wraparound turboramjet engine. The comparison was made for a typical high altitude hypersonic cruise vehicle where the turbojet inlet capture area was required to be half {{as large as the}} ramjet inlet capture area at cruise. The use of a shorter nacelle having substantially lower cooling requirements at cruise for the inlet concept for separate turbojet and <b>ramjet</b> <b>engines</b> is suggested. The separate engine concept better isolates the turbojet from the ramjet, requires no special close off mechanisms within the turbojet, and avoids the circumferential heat load imposed by a wraparound ramjet. A more variable geometry is required...|$|R
