30|$|The {{excitation}} setup, {{built on}} an independent optical platform, {{consists of three}} laser-diode lines, two for excitation (488 nm Coherent Sapphire 488, 50 mW ad 561 nm Spectra-Physics Excelsior, 150 mW) and one for photo-activation (405 nm Coherent Cube, 50 mW). The excitation light is amplitude modulated and gated through an Acousto-Optical Polychromatic Tunable Filter AOM (A.A. Optoelectronics), which allows an on-off switching of each line with a rise time of 1.5 ms. Both the excitation and the activation beams are expanded (10 - 20 X) and the activation beam is spatial filtered (pinhole size 10 um). The filtered and expanded activation beam is combined to the excitation beam-path by a Semrock R 405 -Di 01 dichroic Mirror. The combined laser beams are focused to the back focal plane (BFP) of a 1.45 NA 100 X (or 60 X) Olympus Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIR) objective by a 250 mm focal length, 50 mm diameter, achromatic doublet lens placed on a x-y-z micrometric translation stage. TIR at the sample arises as the focused laser beam is translated away from the optical axis in the back focal plane of the objective, resulting in a controllable exit angle of the beam {{with respect to the}} optical axis. In our setup the beam angle is accurately controlled by the translation of the 250 mm achromatic doublet. A 9.5 mm thick Fused Silica Laser Grade window (SQW- 2037 -UV Melles Griot) placed on a <b>rotating</b> <b>goniometer</b> before the lens is used to translate the collimated beam and maintain the excitation spot {{in the center of the}} field of view as the doublet lens is translated.|$|E
50|$|CH output {{was read}} with an oscilloscope. When a pulse was sent from the {{broadcast}} towers, a visible line travelled horizontally {{across the screen}} very rapidly. The output from the receiver was amplified and fed into the vertical axis of the scope, so a return from an aircraft would deflect the beam upward. This formed a spike on the display, and {{the distance from the}} left side - measured with a small scale {{on the bottom of the}} screen - would give target range. By <b>rotating</b> the receiver <b>goniometer</b> connected to the antennas, the operator could estimate the direction to the target (this was the reason for the cross shaped antennas), while the height of the vertical displacement indicated formation size. By comparing the strengths returned from the various antennas up the tower, altitude could be gauged with some accuracy.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the textural {{characterization}} of very low to greenschist facies metamorphic rocks by means of a conventional X-ray source, possibly establishing a relationship between the extent of morphological orientation of mineral grains and metamorphic degree. For a long time geologists investigated the morphological orientation of mineral grains in polycrystalline rocks by means of petrographic microscope equipped with a Universal stage. More recently diffraction of conventional X-ray sources as well as diffraction (or transmission) of hard X-rays, electrons and neutrons has been applied to these kind of study. However, whereas X-ray conventional sources can be regarded as a routine technology, hard X-ray, electron and neutron sources are only available in a few facilities around the world. Phyllosilicates such as smectite, illite, muscovite, chlorite and biotite {{play a key role in}} the textural characteristics of the mineral assemblages of rocks characterized by increasing metamorphic degree. The present study is focused on the variation of the X-ray intensities of selected reflections of these phases. In short, if a morphologic orientation of the grains of a certain phyllosilicate is present, a variation of the intensity of these reflections will be measured when the rock sample is <b>rotated</b> in a <b>goniometer</b> keeping constant both the incident beam angle and the position of the detector. The samples selected for the study are the following: 1) a Ms, Chl, Qtz, Pl fine grained metapelite from Frassenetto (UD, Italy) (very low grade metamorphism, Anchizone) with some detrital muscovite flakes recognizable by their coarser grain size; 2) Ms, Chl, Qtz, Pl fine grained metapelite from Chiadenis (UD, Italy) (low grade metamorphism, Epizone) with some detrital muscovite flakes recognizable by their coarser grain size; 3) a Ms, Chl, Ilm, Qtz, Pl layered phyllite from Villabassa (BZ, Italy) (Greenschist facies metamorphism, Ms-Chl-Bt), with crenulated main foliation and axial planes defining a second spaced foliation; 4) a Ms, Bt, Grt, Ilm, Qtz, Pl layered phyllite from Luson (BZ, Italy) (Greenschist facies metamorphism, Ms-Bt-Grt), with crenulated main foliation and axial planes defining a second spaced foliation...|$|R
40|$|Both {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (TEM) and scanning {{transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM) experiments profit from recording two-dimensional camera images at very high readout speeds. This includes, but is not limited to, tomography in TEM and ptychography in STEM. The pnCCD (S) TEM camera uses a direct detecting, radiation hard pnCCD with a minimum readout speed of 1 000 full frames per second (fps) with a size of 264 x 264 pixels [1]. It features binning and windowing modes, which allow to further increase the frame rate substantially. For example, 4 -fold binning in one direction, i. e. 66 x 264 pixels, yields a readout speed of 4 000 fps. Up to 20 000 fps are possible in windowing modes. Further applications that benefit from the high readout speed range from imaging on the micro- and millisecond timescale to strain analysis or electric and magnetic field mapping. Typical tomographic reconstructions use tilt series of fewer than 100 images which are recorded in 15 to 60 minutes with conventional cameras running at speeds below 40 fps. The series are recorded by stepwise rotation of the goniometer and taking a camera image after each rotation step. These long acquisition times restrict the acquisition of tomographic series for beam sensitive samples. We have recorded a tilt series containing 3 487 images of an inorganic nanotube in only 3. 5 s with the pnCCD camera [2]. Due to the high readout speed it was possible to <b>rotate</b> the <b>goniometer</b> continuously over a tilt range of − 70 ° to + 30 ° in an FEI Titan 60 – 300, operated at 60 keV beam energy. The short acquisition time and the high sensitivity of the camera allowed to reduce the cumulative electron dose to about 8 electrons per Å 2, i. e. about an order of magnitude lower than conventionally used for low dose tomography. A 3 D reconstruction of the nanowire is shown in Figure 1. The acquisition time was not limited by the readout of the camera, but rather by the rotation speed of the goniometer. Combining the high readout speed with the scanning mode makes 4 D-STEM imaging feasible, a powerful imaging technique where a two-dimensional image is recorded for each probe position of a two-dimensional STEM diffraction pattern. With the pnCCD (S) TEM camera, a 4 D data cube consisting of 256 x 256 (i. e. 65 536) probe positions with a 132 x 264 pixel detector image (using 2 -fold binning) for each probe position can be recorded in about 35 s. Several measurements have been performed to prove the capability of the camera for 4 D-STEM imaging, including strain analysis, magnetic domain mapping and electron ptychography. The latter is a 4 D-STEM technique that was described theoretically already in 1993 [3] but was so far limited experimentally by the low readout speed of existing cameras. In electron ptychography, the intensity distribution in the bright field disk is recorded in 2 D for each STEM probe position. In an electron wave-optical approach the phase and amplitude information is extracted from the recorded intensity images. The reconstructed phase image (Figure 2 a) shows enhanced image contrast compared to the simultaneously acquired conventional annular dark field image (Figure 2 b). Measurements with the pnCCD (S) TEM camera were carried out using a JEOL ARM 200 -CF to investigate different samples with the ptychographic phase reconstruction technique. In conclusion, the pnCCD camera enables new techniques in TEM and STEM. Various fields of application benefit from recording two-dimensional detector images at high speeds. With its direct detection, high readout speed and radiation hardness the pnCCD (S) TEM camera permits the recording of tomographic tilt series and large 4 D-STEM data cubes in short times and thus paves the way for new science...|$|R
