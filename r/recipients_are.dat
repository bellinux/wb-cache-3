5000|$|In British English, valedictions {{have largely}} been {{replaced}} by the use of [...] "Yours sincerely" [...] or [...] "Yours faithfully". [...] "Yours sincerely" [...] is typically employed in English when the <b>recipient</b> <b>is</b> addressed by name (e.g. [...] "Dear John") and is known to the sender to some degree, whereas [...] "Yours faithfully" [...] is used when the <b>recipient</b> <b>is</b> not addressed by name (i.e. the <b>recipient</b> <b>is</b> addressed by a phrase such as [...] "Dear Sir/Madam") or when the <b>recipient</b> <b>is</b> not known personally by the sender.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the significance of immunogenetic factors on the survival of pancreatic allografts in beagle dogs. Donors and <b>recipients</b> <b>were</b> leukocyte antigen (DLA) -typed and mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) -tested. <b>Recipients</b> <b>were</b> made diabetic by total pancreatectomy and immediately implanted intraperitoneally with a vascularized, free-draining (duct unligated) pancreatic segmental (FDPS) allograft. Two groups of dogs were studied. In group I consisting of donor-recipient littermates, <b>recipients</b> <b>were</b> immunosuppressed with prednisone and azathioprine (n = 16 dogs), or not immunosuppressed (n = 4). In group II, <b>recipients</b> <b>were</b> made specifically unresponsive by total body radiation, autologous marrow implantation, and kidney transplantation from DLA-MLC identical donors, 1 yr before FDPS transplantation from the corresponding original kidney donors...|$|R

5|$|The Governor-General of Australia awards the Victoria Cross for Australia, {{with the}} {{approval}} of the Sovereign, on the recommendation of the Minister for Defence. The first medal was awarded on 16 January 2009 to Trooper Mark Donaldson, for the rescue of a coalition forces interpreter from heavy fire in Oruzgan Province in Afghanistan. Donaldson's award came almost 40 years after Warrant Officer Keith Payne became the last Australian to be awarded the (original) Victoria Cross for gallantry on 24 May 1969 during the Vietnam War. Unlike the original Victoria Cross where the announcement of the award is followed some time later by the presentation of the award, the announcement and presentation of all awards of the VC for Australia have occurred on the same occasion with the presentation being made by the Governor-General {{in the presence of the}} Prime Minister. Both VC for Australia and original Victoria Cross <b>recipients</b> <b>are</b> entitled to the Victoria Cross allowance under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its {{variants}} was {{the highest}} award in the military of the Third Reich. <b>Recipients</b> <b>are</b> grouped by grades of the Knight's Cross. During or shortly after World War II, 145 German sailors and officers of the U-boat service {{as part of the}} Kriegsmarine received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Among them, 29 officers received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub), five the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern), and two won the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves Swords and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten). Of these, 144 presentations were formally made and one recipient received the award after 11 May 1945, when Großadmiral Karl Dönitz ordered a cease of all promotions and illegalized all subsequent awards.

5|$|The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its {{variants}} {{were the}} highest award in the military of the Third Reich. During or shortly after World War II, 457 servicemen of the Waffen-SS, including volunteers and conscripts from Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Latvia, Netherlands and Norway, received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Of these, 411 presentations were formally made and evidence of the award {{is available in the}} German Federal Archives. One recipient, Hermann Fegelein, was court-martialed and executed on 29 April 1945. According to German law he was deprived of rank and all awards previously. Fegelein must therefore be considered a de facto but not de jure recipient. A further 46 Knight's Cross, 8 Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and 4 Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords <b>recipients</b> <b>are</b> either lacking the evidence to sustain their listings or received the award under questionable legal terms. However, all of them were accepted by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (Ordensgemeinschaft der Ritterkreuzträger des Eisernen Kreuzes e.V.) as legitimate recipients.|$|E
5|$|The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords {{was awarded}} {{to one of the}} 194 Oak Leaves {{recipients}} of 1945.
