6000|$|... "The King? All {{the world}} knows {{there has been no}} king in France since Louis XIV. There is an obese gentleman at Versailles who wears the crown, but the very news you bring shows for how little he <b>really</b> <b>counts.</b> It is the nobles and clergy who sit in the high places, with the people of France {{harnessed}} under their feet, who are the real rulers. That is why I say that France is a republic; she is a republic built on the best pattern--the Roman pattern. Then, as now, there were great patrician families in luxury, preserving for themselves power and wealth, and what else is accounted worth possessing; and there was the populace crushed and groaning, sweating, bleeding, starving, and perishing in the Roman kennels. That was a republic; the mightiest we have seen." ...|$|E

[...] He looked, in saying this, as if he meant great things, and I was sure he could only mean once more that neither of them mattered if a man wasn't a real gentleman. Perhaps {{it was what he}} did mean; he deprived me however of the exultation of being right by putting the truth in a slightly different way. [...] "The only thing that <b>really</b> <b>counts</b> for one's estimate of a person is his conduct." [...] He had his watch still in his palm, and I reproached him with unfair play in having ascertained beforehand that it was now the hour at which I always gave in. My pleasantry so far failed to mollify him that he promptly added that to the rule he had just enunciated there was absolutely no exception.|$|E
60|$|The real question, then, {{about the}} {{historical}} toad-in-a-hole narrows itself {{down in the}} end merely to this--how long is it credible that a cold-blooded creature might sustain life in a torpid or hibernating condition, without food, and with a very small quantity of fresh air, supplied (let us say) {{from time to time}} through an almost imperceptible fissure? It is well known that reptiles and amphibians are particularly tenacious of life, and that some turtles in particular will live for months, or even for years, without tasting food. The common Greek tortoise, hawked on barrows about the streets of London and bought by a confiding British public under the mistaken impression that its chief fare consists of slugs and cockroaches (it is really far more likely to feed upon its purchaser's choicest seakale and asparagus), buries itself in the ground at the first approach of winter, and snoozes away five months of the year in a most comfortable and dignified torpidity. A snake at the Zoo has even been known to live eighteen months in a voluntary fast, refusing all the most tempting offers of birds and rabbits, merely out of pique at her forcible confinement in a strange cage. As this was a lady snake, however, it is possible that she only went on living out of feminine obstinacy, so that this case <b>really</b> <b>counts</b> for very little.|$|E

60|$|In this connection, as one notably {{inspired}} by emulation, by {{the joy of}} creative work and service, the medical profession comes first to mind. The finer element in this profession is constantly increasing in numbers, growing more and more influential, making life less easy for the quack, the vendor of nostrums, the commercial proprietor of the bogus medical college. The doctor who uses his talents for gain is frowned upon by those of his fellow practitioners whose opinion <b>really</b> <b>counts.</b> Respected physicians in our cities give {{much of their time}} to teaching, animating students with their own spirit; and labour long hours, for no material return, in the clinics of the poor. And how often, in reading our newspapers, do we learn that some medical scientist, by patient work, and often at the risk of life and health, has triumphed over a scourge which has played havoc with humanity throughout the ages! Typhoid has been conquered, and infant paralysis; gangrene and tetanus, which have taken such toll of the wounded in Flanders and France; yellow fever has been stamped out in the tropics; hideous lesions are now healed by a system of drainage. The very list of these achievements is bewildering, and latterly we are given hope of the prolongation of life itself. Here in truth are Christian deeds multiplied by science, made possible by a growing knowledge of and mastery over Nature.|$|E
60|$|With the remark, then, that at such {{tender age}} some naiveness of feeling and {{expression}} is excusable, I proceed to admit that, upon the whole, my previous state of existence {{was not a}} good equipment for a literary life. Perhaps I should not have used the word literary. That word presupposes an intimacy of acquaintance with letters, a turn of mind and a manner of feeling to which I dare lay no claim. I only love letters; but the love of letters does not make a literary man, any more than the love of the sea makes a seaman. And it is very possible, too, that I love the letters in the same way a literary man may love the sea he looks at from the shore--a scene of great endeavour and of great achievements changing the face of the world, the great open way to all sorts of undiscovered countries. No, perhaps I had better say that the life at sea--and I don't mean a mere taste of it, but a good broad span of years, something that <b>really</b> <b>counts</b> as real service--is not, upon the whole, a good equipment for a writing life. God forbid, though, that I should be thought of as denying my masters of the quarter-deck. I am not capable of that sort of apostasy. I have confessed my attitude of piety towards their shades in three or four tales, and if any man on earth more than another needs to be true to himself as he hopes to be saved, it is certainly the writer of fiction.|$|E
6000|$|Your most kind gratulatory note {{deserved}} {{an answer}} more gratefully prompt than this. But I extended my absence {{from town to}} a short visit at Cheltenham, {{and the whole thing}} was virtually, till yesterday, a complete extinction of leisure. Delightful of you to want [...] "details." [...] I think, if I were to inflict them on you, they would all be illustrative of the cheering and rewarding side of our feverish profession. The passage from knock-kneed nervousness (the night of the première, as one clings, in the wing, to the curtain rod, as to the pied des autels) to a simmering serenity is especially life-saving in its effect. I flung myself upon Compton after the 1st act: [...] "In heaven's name, is it going?" [...] "Going?--Rather! You could hear a pin drop!" [...] Then, after that, one felt it--one heard it--one blessed it--and, at the end of all, one (after a decent and discreet delay) simpered and gave oneself up to courbettes before the curtain, while the applausive house emitted agreeable sounds from a kind of gas-flaring indistinguishable dimness and the gratified Compton publicly pressed one's hand and one felt that, really, as far as Southport could testify to the circumstance, the stake was won. Of course it's only Southport--but I have larger hopes, inasmuch as it was just the meagre provincial conditions and the limited provincial interpretation that deprived the performance of all adventitious aid. And when my hero and heroine and another friend supped with me at the inn after the battle, I felt that they were really as radiant as if we were carousing among the slain. They seem indeed wondrous content. The great feature of the evening was the way Compton [...] "came out" [...] beyond what he had done or promised at rehearsal, and acted really most interestingly and admirably--if not a [...] "revelation" [...] at any rate a very jolly surprise. His part is one in which I surmise he <b>really</b> <b>counts</b> upon making a large success--and though I say it who shouldn't, it is one of incontestable opportunities. However, all this is to come--and we stumble in judgment. Amen. Voilà, ma chère amie. You have been through all this, and more, and will tolerate my ingenuities....|$|E

5000|$|Kershaw regards his {{subsequent}} album Ei8ht as his eighth album as No Frills was [...] "90 per cent old songs, {{it was just}} different acoustic versions of those old songs. I didn't <b>really</b> <b>count</b> that {{as a collection of}} original work." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{there is}} another cause for my being content for the moment, with this mere chaos of contrasts. There {{is a very real}} reason for emphasising those contrasts, and for shunning the temptation to shut our eyes to them even {{considered}} as contrasts. It is necessary to insist that the contrasts are not easy to turn into combinations; that the red robes of Rome and the green scarves of Islam will not very easily fade into a dingy russet; that the gold of Byzantium and the brass of Babylon will require a hot furnace to melt them into any kind of amalgam. The reason for this is akin to what has already been said about Jerusalem as a knot of realities. It is especially a knot of popular realities. Although it is so small a place, or rather because it is so small a place, it is a domain and a dominion for the masses. Democracy is never quite democratic except when it is quite direct; and it is never quite direct except when it is quite small. So soon as a mob has grown large enough to have delegates it has grown large enough to have despots; indeed the despots are often much the more representative of the two. Now in a place so small as Jerusalem, what we call the rank and file <b>really</b> <b>counts.</b> And it is generally true, in religions especially, that the real enthusiasm or even fanaticism {{is to be found in}} the rank and file. In all intense religions it is the poor who are more religious and the rich who are more irreligious. It is certainly so with the creeds and causes that come to a collision in Jerusalem. The great Jewish population throughout the world did hail Mr. Balfour's declaration with something almost of the tribal triumph they might have shown when the Persian conqueror broke the Babylonian bondage. It was rather the plutocratic princes of Jewry who long hung back and hesitated about Zionism. The mass of Mahometans really are ready to combine against the Zionists as they might have combined against the Crusades. It is rather the responsible Mahometan leaders who will naturally be found more moderate and diplomatic. This popular spirit may take a good or a bad form; and a mob may cry out many things, right and wrong. But a mob cries out [...] "No Popery"; it does not cry out [...] "Not so much Popery," [...] still less [...] "Only a moderate admixture of Popery." [...] It shouts [...] "Three cheers for Gladstone," [...] it does not shout [...] "A gradual and evolutionary social tendency towards some ideal similar to that of Gladstone." [...] It would find it quite a difficult thing to shout; and it would find exactly the same difficulty with all the advanced formulae about nationalisation and internationalisation and class-conscious solidarity. No rabble could roar at the top of its voice the collectivist formula of [...] "The nationalisation of all the means of production, distribution, and exchange." [...] The mob of Jerusalem is no exception to the rule, but rather an extreme example of it. The mob of Jerusalem has cried some remarkable things in its time; but they were not pedantic and they were not evasive. There was a day when it cried a single word; [...] "Crucify." [...] It was a thing to darken the sun and rend the veil of the temple; but there was no doubt about what it meant.|$|E
