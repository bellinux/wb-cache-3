40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{a hybrid}} mesh-tree {{topology}} construction for Bluetooth ad hoc network is proposed. The hybrid mesh-tree constructs a mesh-shaped topology in one dense {{area that is}} extended by tree-shaped topology to the other sparse areas. First, a designated root constructs a tree-shaped subnet, and then propagates a constant k in its downstream direction to determine new roots. Each new root asks its upstream master to start a <b>return</b> <b>connection</b> to convert the first tree-shaped subnet into a mesh-shaped subnet. At the same time, each new root repeats the same procedure as the root to build its own tree-shaped subnet until the whole scatternet is formed. As a result, the mesh subnet size can be controlled by appropriated selecting the k parameter. Simulation {{results show that the}} hybrid mesh-tree achieves better network performance than blueHRT does. As a result, the optimal k value can be determined, and the hybrid mesh-tree generates an efficient scatternet configuration...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{reconfigurable}} mesh-tree with a disjoint {{hierarchical routing}} protocol for the Bluetooth sensor network is proposed. First, a designated root constructs a tree-shaped subnet and propagates parameters k and c in its downstream direction to determine new roots. Each new root asks its upstream master {{to start a}} <b>return</b> <b>connection</b> to convert the first tree-shaped subnet into a mesh-shaped subnet. At the same time, each new root repeats the same procedure as the designated root to build its own tree-shaped subnet, until the whole scatternet is formed. As a result, the reconfigurable mesh-tree constructs a mesh-shaped topology in one densely covered area that is extended by tree-shaped topology to other sparsely covered areas. To locate the optimum k layer for various sizes of networks, a peak-search method is introduced in the designated root to determine the optimum mesh-tree configuration. In addition, the reconfigurable mesh-tree can dynamically compute the optimum layer k when {{the size of the}} network changes in the topology maintenance phase. In order to deliver packets over the mesh-tree networks, a disjoint hierarchical routing protocol is designed during the scatternet formation phase to efficiently forward packets in-between the mesh-subnet and the tree-subnet. To achieve the energy balance design, two equal disjoint paths are generated, allowing each node to alleviate network congestion, since most traffic occurs at the mesh-subnet. Simulation results show that the joint reconfigurable method and routing algorithm generate an efficient scatternet configuration by achieving better scatternet and routing performance than BlueHRT (bluetooth hybrid ring tree). Furthermore, the disjoint routing with rechargeable battery strategy effectively improves network lifetime and demonstrates better energy efficiency than conventional routing methods...|$|E

40|$|Investigations on {{effects of}} Xenon {{application}} time on cerebral outcome following cardiopulmonary bypass with cerebral air embolism in the rat‚Äù Cerebral air embolism (CAE) {{is thought to}} be one of the risk factors for adverse cerebral outcome following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Neurologic and neurocognitive deficits after cardiac surgery remain a common and severe complication, alleviating patients¬¥ quality of life for years. Providing neuroprotective properties and cardiovascular stability Xenon may also improve cerebral outcome after cardiac surgery with CPB. However, Xenon`s disposition to expand air bubbles could possibly be a disadvantage for its use in combination with CPB, as such air bubbles can be detected during CPB. In this study Xenon was administered before (group XEv), during (group XEw) or after CPB (group XEn) to investigate differential effects of application time on cerebral outcome after CPB with cerebral air embolism in a rat model. 50 male Sprague-Dawley rats (BW: 330 - 390 g) were assigned to five groups of ten animals each. Control group (Ko) animals were neither exposed to CPB nor received Xenon. The CPB-groups such as Xenon before CPB, Xenon during CPB, Xenon after CPB and no Xenon (kXE) were anesthetized with isofluran, intubated and ventilated with 2. 0 - 2. 5 Vol % isoflurane in 50 % oxygen. The right superficial epigastric artery and vein, the right external jugular vein and the sacral artery were cannulated for blood sampling, application of drugs, invasive blood pressure monitoring as well as inflow and <b>return</b> <b>connection</b> to the CPB circuit. A catheter was inserted into the right internal carotid artery and ten repetitively administered air emboli of 0. 3 ¬µl each were applicated. After completion of surgery all animals received an additional basic intravenous anesthesia (continuous infusion of midazolam, fentanyl and atracurium) which was maintained until the end of operation (60 min after CPB). Rats subjected to Xenon before CPB were ventilated with Xenon (56 % Xenon, 5 % N 2, 34 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2) applied for 60 minutes before connection to CPB. The Xenon during CPB group received the above mentioned Xenon gas mixture through the oxygenator for 90 minutes during CPB. Xenon after CPB animals were treated in the same fashion but inhaled Xenon for 60 minutes after CPB and no Xenon animals continously received an oxygen-air-mixture (61 % N 2, 34 % O 2 und 5 % CO 2). Emerging from anesthesia the rats recovered by being placed in an oxygen-enriched environment. Animals underwent standardized functional neurologic testing on the 1 st- 4 th, 8 th, 12 th, 16 th and 21 st postoperative days. Beginning with the 4 th postoperative day cognitive performance as well as behaviour was ascertained up to the 21 st postoperative day using the modified hole-board test. All neurologic, cognitive and behavioural testing was performed by a investigator blinded to treatment. After testing on the 21 st postoperative day the rats were killed by exsanguination in deep isofluran anesthesia and subjected to in situ brain fixation with formaline. Brains were removed in total, were serially cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for further histological evaluation determining maximal infarction size and infarction volume. This is the first investigative study on the effects of different Xenon application times, that is before, during and after CPB in combination with CAE. The occurrence of CAE is more likely during CPB in contrast to before and after CPB where CAE are rarer. In this setting rats showed short-time sensomotoric and long-term cognitive and behavioural changes which was confirmed by histopathological results. The significant worse outcome of animals treated with Xenon after CPB is of profound relevance discussing the safety of Xenon`s use associated with CPB. Interestingly rats subjected to CPB without Xenon achieved no better results neither at cognitive and behavioural testing nor at histopathological evaluation. Knowledge about the pathophysiology of CAE remains sparse and further investigation in this direction would be of high importance in trying to explain the results of this study...|$|E
