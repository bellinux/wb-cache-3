5|$|A <b>road</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> town of Potrero to Tecate existed by 1917. The Tecate border {{crossing}} originally opened in 1932. In 1938, the San Diego County {{board of supervisors}} proposed moving rerouting the road to be shorter and on more level ground, although there was opposition from local residents and businesses who favored the old road. However, {{the route of the}} road to Tecate has remained the same since then.|$|E

5|$|The {{entirety}} of Mile Strip Road east of US62 was initially maintained by Erie County as CR460. By 2001, the junction between NY179, Mile Strip Road, and the Thruway was reconfigured in{{to its current}} design and NY179 was extended east to its current terminus at US20. CR460 was then truncated to US20 on its western end, transferring maintenance of Mile Strip <b>Road</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Thruway to US20 to the New York State Department of Transportation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{initially}} {{planned for}} an East Coast shoot, The Judy Garland Show was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The network {{had gone to}} great expense to prepare the studio, including an estimated $100,000 to raise the stage and install a separate revolving stage. Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that led from her dressing room to the stage was painted to resemble the Yellow Brick <b>Road</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Wizard of Oz.|$|E
5|$|Although the GWR {{agreed to}} {{contribute}} £175,000 {{and a similar}} sum was promised by the GNR, sufficient funds to make a start on construction had not been raised {{by the end of}} 1857. Costs were reduced by cutting back part of the route at the western end so that it did not connect directly to the GWR station, and by dropping the line south of Farringdon. In 1858, Pearson arranged a deal between the Met and the City of London Corporation whereby the Met bought land it needed around the new Farringdon <b>Road</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> City for £179,000 and the City purchased £200,000 worth of shares. The route changes were approved by Parliament in August 1859, meaning that the Met finally had the funding to match its obligations and construction could begin.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, {{when the}} Jeffries Freeway (I-96) was completed, M-14 was {{shortened}} {{to have its}} eastern terminus at I-275 exit28 in Plymouth Township, and the portion of Plymouth Road within the city of Detroit was returned to local control. The portion of Plymouth Road–Ann Arbor Road between I-275 and the city boundary with Redford Township was retained as an unsigned trunkline, maintained {{by the state to}} this day. In 1979, the final segment of the M-14 freeway, between M-153 and I-275 was completed. The former route of M-14 in Washtenaw County along Plymouth–Ann Arbor Road was returned to local control. The portion of Ann Arbor <b>Road</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Wayne County line east to I-275 also became an unsigned state trunkline, also still maintained by MDOT.|$|E
5|$|In March 1779 the {{regiment}} was reassigned to the Northern Department, and marched to Springfield, Massachusetts.

They arrived in {{what was called the}} Coös Country of northern New Hampshire in May, and were tasked to build a road now known as the Bayley-Hazen Military <b>Road</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Connecticut River to St. Jean, Quebec. Hazen had been secretly ordered to the area by Washington in April. Along with a large portion of Colonel Timothy Bedel's Regiment and Major Benjamin Whitcomb's New Hampshire rangers, they began to extend the road, a portion of which had been constructed in 1776 under the direction of Colonel Jacob Bayley.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of Dunedin, it was {{impossible}} for a dray to reach the Caversham Valley in wet weather unless it went by a circuitous route around the hills.

This formed the basis for later roads into the suburb. The road curved {{around the edge of the}} hills at the Glen to avoid a large swamp, the site of which is currently occupied by Carisbrook sports ground.|$|E
