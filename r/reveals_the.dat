5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain <b>reveals</b> <b>the</b> hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot.

The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
