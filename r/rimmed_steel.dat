50|$|Capped steel {{starts as}} <b>rimmed</b> <b>steel</b> but part {{way through the}} {{solidification}} the ingot is capped. This {{can be done by}} literally covering the ingot mold or by adding a deoxidizing agent. The top of the ingot then forms into a solid layer of steel, but the rim {{of the rest of the}} ingot is thinner than in a <b>rimmed</b> <b>steel.</b> Also there is less segregation of impurities.|$|E
5000|$|Early in 1965, {{several small}} 12" [...] thick slabs of <b>rimmed</b> <b>steel</b> were repetitively heated in a {{prototype}} 1,000 kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12" [...] thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature {{in less than}} one hour.|$|E
50|$|Common {{deoxidizing}} agents include aluminium, ferrosilicon and manganese. Aluminium {{reacts with}} the dissolved gas to form aluminium oxide. The aluminum oxide precipitates provide the additional benefit of pinning grain boundaries, thereby preventing grain growth during heat treatments. For steels {{of the same}} grade a killed steel will be harder than <b>rimmed</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Due to {{production}} processes, as the carbon content of <b>rimmed</b> and capped <b>steel</b> increases above 0.08%, the cleanliness decreases.|$|R
50|$|The {{yield of}} <b>rimmed</b> and capped <b>steel</b> is {{slightly}} better than that of semi-killed steel. These types of steels are commonly used for sheet and strip metal because of their excellent surface condition. It is also used in most cold-working applications.|$|R
50|$|According to Mallet, she {{was given}} the part of Tilly Masterson when someone sent a photo of her in a bikini to Bond {{producer}} Cubby Broccoli. The character was killed off during the film when Oddjob (Harold Sakata) hurled his <b>steel</b> <b>rimmed</b> hat at her.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Rimmed</b> <b>steel,</b> {{also known}} as drawing quality steel, has little to no {{deoxidizing}} agent added to it during casting which causes carbon monoxide to evolve rapidly from the ingot. This causes small blow holes in the surface that are later closed up in the hot rolling process. Another result is the segregation of elements; {{almost all of the}} carbon, phosphorus, and sulfur move {{to the center of the}} ingot, leaving an almost perfect [...] "rim" [...] of pure iron on the outside of the ingot. This gives the ingot an excellent surface finish because of this iron rim, but also form the most segregated composition. Most <b>rimmed</b> <b>steel</b> has a carbon content below 0.25% carbon, a manganese content below 0.6%, and is not alloyed with aluminum, silicon, and titanium. This type of steel is commonly used for cold-bending, cold-forming, cold-heading and, as the name implies, drawing. Due to the non-uniformity of alloying elements it is not recommended for hot-working applications.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Study on the fractural {{mechanism}} of thin sheet metals focuses {{on how to}} efficiently fracture and recycle the scrapped vehicles and electrical equipments. By using the experimental fracture mechanics, the failure mode was studied for 10 F <b>rimmed</b> <b>steel</b> sheets to be crushed and recycled. In-plane mode I, out-plane mixed mode I /III and mode III fracture tests were conducted under different loading angles. The effects and contributions of mixed mode crack extensions for 10 F <b>rimmed</b> <b>steel</b> sheets were analyzed and some sensitive fractural factors were studied. The experimental results show that pure mode III is most viable to fracture the thin sheet 10 F rimmed steels...|$|E
40|$|Formal concept {{analysis}} {{is a new}} mathematical approach to data analysis, data mining and to discavering patterns in data. The result of {{the application of the}} formal concept analysis method to the behavior of the galvanizing of <b>rimmed</b> <b>steel</b> is presented. Effects of additives in the galvanizing pracess have been correlated to the chemical element properties of the additives. This model may also help to design new alloys as aditives in the galvanizing process...|$|E
40|$|In {{repairing}} {{and strengthening}} operations of ancient riveted steel bridges {{is important to}} estimate and assess the structural degradation of the old metals in order to guaranty the structural safety. Long-time operated metallic materials (mild, <b>rimmed</b> low carbon <b>steels</b> < 0. 1 % C, puddle irons) subjected to cyclic loading show tendency to the microstructural degradation processes. In this paper, {{the study of the}} structural degradation of puddle irons and steels from old metallic bridges with long-term operation is proposed. SFRH/BD/ 135257 / 2017.

50|$|During the 1940s and 1950s {{gangs of}} men {{could be seen}} {{breaking}} stones by hammer and wedges all along the Yellow Road. The stones were broken down to a size suitable {{for use as a}} road surface. With the stone topped road the action of the <b>steel</b> <b>rimmed</b> cart wheels created a loud familiar rhythmic noise of steel on stone which could be heard a long way away. This was a Government funded scheme aimed at providing work and a meagre income for unemployed labour so as to ensure that the families did not suffer too greatly.|$|R
50|$|The 8 inch barrels were re-lined to 7.2 {{in and the}} old {{carriages}} {{were retained}} although the original <b>steel</b> <b>rimmed</b> wheels were replaced with new pneumatic balloon-tyre wheels, as {{was consistent with the}} motorisation of the British Army. The new four-charge ammunition increased the range to 16,900 yd, but when fired at full charge the recoil caused the weapon to rear violently and jump backwards. To help counter this, two wedge shaped ramps were placed behind the wheels although the gun could sometimes still jump over them, presenting a hazard to crews. Marks I-IV differed only in the original 8-inch barrel used and the type of conversion; some barrels and carriages were also supplied from US World War I stocks.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} recent {{developments}} in high power, carbon dixoide laser welding is presented. Deep penetration welding in stainless steel to 0. 5 -in. thick, high speed welding in thin gage <b>rimmed</b> <b>steel</b> and gas shielded welding in Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy are described. The effects of laser power, power density, focusing optics, gas-shielding techniques, material properties and weld speed on weld quality and penetration are discussed. It is shown that laser welding performance in thin materials is {{comparable to that of}} electron beams. It is further shown that high quality welds, as evidenced by NDT, mechanical and metal-lographic tests, can be achieved. The potential of the laser for industrial welding applications is indicated...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{tubular steel}} {{members and their}} connections are studied under ultimate tensile load conditions. Three end connection details are considered. These are practical connections, but one has a deliberately introduced defect of welding fabrication detail. Two types of steel are used: one is a conventional semi-killed mild steel, while {{the other is a}} <b>rimmed</b> <b>steel</b> that has been cold formed to produce an enhanced yield stress. The ratio of ultimate stress to yield stress (strain hardening ratio) is widely different for the two steels. The tests highlight the reduction in ultimate-load capacity and the severely reduced ductility that follows when defects of fabrication and low strain hardening ratio steels occur together...|$|E
40|$|Static tensile {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on specimens of a <b>rimmed</b> <b>steel</b> and a semi-killed steel meeting ASTM A 7 re~uirements, a structural silicon steel (ASTM A 94), and a low alloy high tensile steel (ASTM A 242). The fabricated edge conditions used included machined edges, sheared edges, flame-cut edges, {{and in some cases}} flame-cut edges subse~uently flame softened. The flame-cut edges included both manual and guided flame-cut techni~ues. It is concluded from the tests that for all of the steels tested, the strength and the ductility of the machined edges is good. For all except the silicon steel, the strength and the ductility of the guided flamecut edges were also good. However, for the manual flame-cutting procedure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{structural}} components from {{structures such as}} bridge {{members are}} subjected to a long operating period of time. The problem of fatigue cracks is more interesting in existing bridge structures with existing cracks. In case of the structures erected {{at the turn of}} the 19 th and 20 th centuries, the cracks are natural elements of the old steel metallic structures. The uniaxial fatigue crack growth description lead us often to significant errors in predicting of a residual lifetime. As a good example, it can be a residual lifetime of the riveted joints in such a type of structures. On the other hand, the 19 th century structures were erected with puddled iron or low carbon mild <b>rimmed</b> <b>steel.</b> The experimental results [1, 2] obtained by authors, have shown that the fatigue cracks grow much faster than its modern equivalent. This phenomenon is supported by microstructural degradation processes [2]. In this paper some examples of degenerated microstructures have been presented. In order to fill a lack in experimental data in the literature, the results of a mixed mode (I+II) fatigue crack growth have been presented and discussed within the background of Fracture Mechanics models. All the results have been implemented into the Abaqus environment...|$|E
40|$|Static tensile {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on specimens of a <b>rimmed</b> <b>steel</b> and a semi-killed steel meeting ASTM A 7 requirements, a structural silicon steel (ASTM A 94), and a low alloy high tensile steel (ASTM A 242). The fabricated edge conditions used included machined edges, sheared edges, flame-cut edges, {{and in some cases}} flame-cut edges subse~uently flame softened. The flame-cut edges included both manual and guided flame-cut techniques. It is concluded from the tests that for all of the steels tested, the strength and the ductility of the machined edges is good. For all except the silicon steel, the strength and the ductility of the guided flamecut edges were also good. However, for the manual flame-cutting procedure, there was in some cases serious impairment of the physical properties. Even the automatic flame cutting impaired the properties of the silicon steel, but the ductility and strength were restored by subsequent appropriate flame softening of the edge. The sheared edge impaired the ductility of all of the steels tested. The greatest loss in ductility was caused in the semi-killed steel where the maximum strength also was reduced, in some instances falling as low as the yield strength. The harmful effect of the sheared edge on the ductility was apparently eliminated by a subsequent flame softening treatment. The strength and the ductility were increased to practically the same values as those of the same steel with machined edges. Only under the most damaging edge conditions was the strength at a brittle fracture as low as the yield point. With the better methods of edge preparation, the strength was considerably above the yield point and approached the usual ultimate strength of the material.
