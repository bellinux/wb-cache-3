Based on agronomic evidence in experimental settings, the government of Ethiopia has focused extension efforts on promoting the widespread uptake of <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> to address low teff yields, replacing the traditional broadcasting method of planting teff. Using an innovative Randomized Controlled Trial set-up, we show that the implementation of <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> at the farm level significantly increases total labor use, but not teff yields, relative to broadcast planting, resulting in a substantial drop in labor productivity when adopting <b>row</b> <b>planting.</b> Moreover, the implementation of <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> has important consequences for inter- and intra-household labor allocation, with relatively more use of non-family labor.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} radiation absorption and use efficiency (RUE) in replacement series intercropping of chickpea and sesame. The Experiment included main factor A (planting methods) with two levels a 1 (<b>row</b> <b>planting)</b> and a 2 (mixed planting) and factor B (replacement planting pattern) consisting of five levels b 1 (chickpea monoculture), b 2 (75 % chickpea+ 25 % sesame), b 3 (50 % chickpea+ 50 % sesame), b 4 (25 % chickpea+ 75 % sesame) and b 5 (sesame monoculture). The experiment was arranged in a split plots based on randomized complete blocks design with three replications. Results showed that sesame RUE was higher than chickpea RUE in all treatments. The amount of sesame RUE varied from 1. 33 up to 2. 07 g. MJ- 1 PAR and from 1. 27 up to 1. 66 g. MJ- 1 PAR in <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> and mixed planting, respectively. RUE chickpea, also varied from 0. 86 up to 1. 14 g. MJ- 1 PAR and from 0. 48 up to 0. 99 g. MJ- 1 PAR in <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> and mixed planting, respectively. The results also showed that sesame and chickpea RUE of intercropping treatments was higher than monocrop. In general, the amount of RUE of both crops in <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> was higher than mixed planting either in intercrop or monocrop treatments. On {{the basis of these}} results the best recommendable treatment for intercropping is 75 % chickpea+ 25 % sesame based on <b>row</b> <b>planting.</b> The chickpea RUE of this treatment was highest level (1. 14 g. MJ- 1) among the other treatments and the sesame RUE of this treatment was higher than sesame monocrop RUE. The results of radiation absorption showed that in row intercropping treatments the amount of radiation absorption was higher than sesame monocrop but had not significant differences with chickpea monocrop. The amount of radiation absorption of mixed planting was lower than <b>row</b> <b>planting.</b> Furthermore, the differences between radiation absorption of mixed intercropping treatments and monocrop were not equal to the differences between radiation absorption of row intercropping treatments and monocrop...|$|E
40|$|Adoption of yieldincreasing {{technologies}} {{is seen as}} a {{key driver}} to increase agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is, however, a lack of empirical evidence on the impact of programs aiming to scale-up the adoption of improved technologies from research settings to the farm level. To fill this gap, this paper assesses the impact of the promotion of a new agricultural technology, i. e. <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> at reduced seed rate, on farmers’ teff yields in Ethiopia. The results of a randomized control trial show that the program to scale-up <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> on average has a positive effect on teff yield. Depending on the measure of yield used, we find increases between 2 percent—but not statistically significant—and 17 percent. These findings are in contrast with larger yield increases found on village demonstration plots and in more controlled settings, {{as well as with the}} yield increase expected by teff farmers. The differences seemingly are linked to problems in implementation of the program and of its recommendations, methodological issues, and likely over-optimism on the potential of <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> in real farm settings. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} more detailed {{insight into the}} social and economic dimensions of the teff variant of the systems of rice intensification (SRI) that is widely promoted in Ethiopia. Based primarily on experiment station trials, the large-scale public extension campaign to promote the uptake of the <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> technology in teff production has already become a major public policy thrust of the Government of Ethiopia. The paper is an impact assessment of the ‘pre-scale-up’ phase of this government program and provides rigorous evaluation-based insights on teff farmers’ productivity benefits, perceptions, and returns with <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> under real-world conditions at the farm level. The results highlight the problems in implementation of the program and of its recommendations, methodological issues, and likely overoptimism on the potential of <b>row</b> <b>planting</b> in real farm settings. This calls for the need of a more careful assessment of on-farm constraints towards adoption before the design and widespread implementation of the promotion campaigns for improved agricultural technologies. This work has resulted in a series of IFPRI working papers (here and here) that are in the publication pipeline. This presentation speaks to both the nature of political agronomy and the importance of evidence in support of new agronomy. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} agricultural production, Brazil opted {{for the expansion of}} farming areas and the intensive use of mechanization, causing serious damage to soils. At the same time, conservation practices such as no-tillage farming are also in use. Nevertheless, soil density assessments are necessary in both situations. Practical and controversial, the methodology of penetrometry is the most utilized in such assessments. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the vertical stratification of soil resistance to penetration. Data was collected in a Typic Hapludox under no-tillage. Samples were collected in forty points of a 50 x 50 m grid. Soil resistance was evaluated in three different positions in each point: <b>plant</b> <b>rows,</b> between the <b>plant</b> <b>rows,</b> and in the rows of the tractor path. Measurements were taken using a hydraulic-electronic penetrometer. Factorial analysis with orthogonal rotation, a Multivariate Analysis technique, was used to analyze soil resistance of soil layers. Four layers were identified in the <b>plant</b> <b>rows,</b> when more superficial layers had higher relative variance. Three layers were identified in the <b>plant</b> <b>rows</b> and in rows of the tractor path, points of anthropic action; in this case, deeper layers had higher relative variance...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to record vegetational changes induced by {{the construction of a}} large-diameter gas pipeline through deciduous forested wetlands. Two second-growth wetland sites mapped Lenawee soils were selected in Midland County, Michigan: Site 1, a younger stand subjected to recent selective logging, and Site 2, a more mature stand. The collection of ecological data to analyze plant succession on the right-of-way (ROW) and the effects of the developing <b>ROW</b> <b>plant</b> communities on adjacent forest communities was initiated in 1989. Cover class estimates were made for understory and <b>ROW</b> <b>plant</b> species on the basis of 1 {times} 1 {minus}m quadrats. Individual stem diameters and species counts were recorded for overstory plants in 10 {minus}m quadrats. Although long-term studies have not been completed, firm baseline data were established for comparative analyses with future sampling. Current data indicate that vegetation became well-established on the ROW within one year and subsequently increased in coverage. About 65 % of the species were wetland indicators, and the dominants included seeded and natural invading species; nevertheless, some elements of the original flora regenerated and persist. The plants of the ecotone understories of both sites changed from their original composition {{as a result of the}} installation of the gas pipeline. Although some forest species persist at both sites, the ecotone of Site I was influenced more by the seeded species, whereas the natural invaders were more important at Site 2...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} effect of {{different}} planting patterns and density of sunflower on yield and on extinction coefficient. The experiment was conducted in the field at the Seed and Plant Improvement Institute, Karaj, Iran on a loamy clay. Planting patterns included wide rows, conventional rows, twin rectangular rows and twin zigzag <b>rows.</b> Populations of <b>plants</b> were at 3 levels including 6, 8 and 10 plants per square meter. The results show that different planting patterns sometimes produced higher yield, but not always. Furthermore, equidistant plant distribution at equal plant densities produced a higher radiation interception and extinction coefficient. Moreover, when row spacing was reduced, grain yield increased. The greatest increase in radiation interception and in the extinction coefficient in response to planting patterns and plant densities was observed in twin zigzag <b>rows</b> of 8 <b>plants</b> m- 2. Twin zigzag <b>rows</b> of 8 <b>plants</b> m- 2 and conventional <b>rows</b> of 8 <b>plants</b> m- 2 produced the highest yield...|$|R
