I am frequently told that German occupation troops would finally have to intervene against Ustaše crimes. This may happen eventually. <b>Right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>with</b> the available forces, I could not ask for such action. Ad hoc intervention in individual cases could make the German Army look responsible for countless crimes which it could not prevent in the past.|$|E

He’s living by different standards <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>with</b> a different philosophy, so he doesn’t {{want to be a part}} of anything that he knows is going to end up being a product.

In February 2011 the group was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Drummers Tommy, Marky, and Richie attended the ceremony. Marky declared, [...] "This is amazing. I never expected this. I'm sure Johnny, Joey, and Dee Dee would never have expected this."

500|$|After Heppner {{introduced}} his bandmates to progressive rock, the band integrated minor influences from the genre in their songwriting and compositions, including touches of keyboards, while {{trying not to}} deviate too much {{from the sound of}} Hello Master. The change in style was largely adopted so they could challenge themselves musically, but not specifically to be heavier: [...] "I don't think we go in wanting to write a heavier record," [...] guitarist Dan Watchorn stated. [...] "I don't think we have a preconceived notion of what we want, the riffs and melodies just kind of come. The fact that Hello Master was a bit more on the poppy side and Prior to the Fire has a bit more edge to it is just where we're at <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>with</b> music." [...] Of the end result, drummer Vince Nudo said, [...] "Our individual tastes came out more [...] [...] It's more organic. We're not holding back so much." ...|$|E
500|$|GamesRadar {{offered some}} {{praise for the}} system and its library, stating, [...] "With its 8-bit {{processor}} and bright color screen, it was basically the Sega Master System in your hands. How many batteries did we suck dry playing Sonic, Madden and Road Rash on the bus or in the car, or in the dark when {{we were supposed to}} be sleeping? You couldn't do that on a Game Boy!" [...] By contrast, IGN reviewer Levi Buchanan noted the Game Gear's biggest fault was its game library when compared to the Game Boy, stating that [...] "the software was completely lacking compared to its chief rival, which was bathed in quality games. It didn't matter that the Game Gear was more powerful. The color screen did not reverse any fortunes. Content and innovation beat out technology, a formula that Nintendo is using <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>with</b> the continued ascendance of the DS and Wii." [...] Buchanan later went on to praise some parts of the Game Gear's library, however, stating [...] "Some of those Master System tweaks were very good games, and fun is resilient against time." [...] Retro Gamer praised Sega's accomplishment in surviving against the competition of Nintendo in the handheld console market with the Game Gear, noting that [...] "for all the handhelds that have gone up against the might of Nintendo and ultimately lost out, Sega's Game Gear managed to last the longest, only outdone in sales by the Sony PSP. [...] For its fans, it will remain a piece of classic gaming hardware whose legacy lives on forever." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinkner {{thought the}} added musical element {{improved}} the episode, {{because it gave}} insights into each of the characters' psyches. According to Wyman and Pinkner, the [...] "episode {{was supposed to be}} a fantastical episode in the first place, and so the music supports the storytelling". Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's kind of what we're doing. We felt that that was a great way to get across Walter's mind frame and where his head is at <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>with</b> his son missing". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote [...] "It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking. We get [...] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling". He added, [...] "It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to grapple with the fact that his son is gone". Jasika Nicole continued: [...] "I have a musical theater background, so I've been waiting for some moment in some realm of where I am in TV and film for this to happen and, you know, of course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm in this show, which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance in this show. And I did! It's so awesome!" [...] Swerling called it [...] "the longest and possibly most difficult episode of the season" [...] to create.|$|E

Palin responded, [...] "I don't think so right now. I was surprised that the President spent time on that in his State of the Union speech when he only spent about 9 percent {{of his time in}} the State of the Union on national security issues. And I say that because there are other things to be worried about <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>with</b> the military. I think that kind of on the back burner is sufficient for now.
