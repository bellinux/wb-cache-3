40|$|In {{this paper}} we conceptualize {{the impact of}} {{information}} technology on marketing decisionmaking. We argue that developments in information technology affect the performance of marketing decision-makers through different <b>routes.</b> <b>Advances</b> in information technology enhance the possibilities to collect data and to generate information for supporting marketing decision-making. Potentially, this will {{have a positive impact}} on decision-making performance. Managerial expertise will favor the transformation of data into market insights. However, as the cognitive capabilities of marketing managers are limited, increasing amounts of data may also increase the complexity of the decision-making context. In turn, increased complexity enhances the probability of biased decision processes (e. g., the inappropriate use of heuristics) thereby negatively affecting decision-making performance. Marketing management support systems, also being the result of advances in information technology, are t [...] ...|$|R

Improved instruments and analysis techniques are providing an expanding data base for trace species including ozone, carbon monoxide, water vapor, condensation nuclei and mass concentrations of sulfates and nitrates. Simultaneous measurements of several trace species obtained frequently {{can be used to}} uniquely identify the source of the air mass as being typically tropospheric or stratospheric. A quantitative understanding of the tropospheric-stratospheric exchange processes leads to better knowledge of the atmospheric impact of pollution through the development of improved simulation models of the atmosphere...|$|R

40|$|The article {{explores the}} limits of the ECJ's {{exclusive}} jurisdiction by addressing two main issues: firstly, whether there are exceptions to that exclusivity, such as the application of the CILFIT case law or the exclusion of Community law from the dispute. Secondly, it asks whether other international courts must respect the ECJ's jurisdiction over a case. The article commences by briefly discussing the ECJ's exclusive jurisdiction as it was established in Opinion 1 / 91 and the Mox Plant-Case and draws conclusions from this case law. It then addresses the above-mentioned points and comes to the conclusion that there are generally no exceptions to the ECJ's exclusive jurisdiction and that the only option open to Member States is to exclude Community law from a dispute (and even that option is subject to limitations). Furthermore, after exploring several <b>routes</b> <b>advanced</b> in the academic discussion, the article comes to the conclusion that other courts must respect the ECJ's jurisdiction and as a consequence declare the case inadmissible...|$|R
