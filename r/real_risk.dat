5|$|Following {{the orders}} of {{the captain of the}} Barracouta, Waddell {{immediately}} converted the warship back to a merchant ship, storing her cannon below, discharging all arms, and repainting the hull. At this point, Waddell decided to sail back to England and surrender the Shenandoah in Liverpool. Surrendering in an American port carried the certainty of facing a court with a Union point of view and the very <b>real</b> <b>risk</b> of a trial for piracy, for which he and the crew could be hanged. Sailing south around Cape Horn and staying well off shore to avoid shipping that might report Shenandoah's position, they saw no land for another 9,000 miles until they arrived back in England, having logged a total of over 58,000 miles around the world in a year's travel—the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E

5|$|On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi {{signed his}} first {{contract}} {{as a senior}} team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150million. His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou. While Capello requested to loan Messi, a bid to buy him came from Inter Milan, {{who were willing to}} pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages. According to then-president Joan Laporta, {{it was the only time}} the club faced a <b>real</b> <b>risk</b> of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay. On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014.|$|E
25|$|Justice Loh {{also created}} a buzz in legal circles by departing from the {{inherent}} tendency test and instead favouring the <b>real</b> <b>risk</b> test. According to lawyers who had studied such cases, what the judge did was significant because the <b>real</b> <b>risk</b> formula is clearer, {{even though he had}} defined it broadly. Under his definition, a statement with even a small risk of undermining public confidence in the courts would be found to be in contempt. The use of the <b>real</b> <b>risk</b> test is also significant as it {{comes at a time when}} the Government is planning to codify the law on contempt.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} the latter extreme, the Court of Appeal held {{that the concept of}} a <b>real</b> <b>risk</b> should not be equated with the concept of a clear and present danger as the two {{concepts}} have different meanings. The concept of a clear and present danger is a more stringent standard compared to the concept of a <b>real</b> <b>risk.</b> The latter encompasses the former but not vice versa.|$|E

40|$|Infection {{prevention}} in dentistry is {{an important}} topic that has gained more interest {{in recent years and}} guidelines for the prevention of cross-transmission are common practice in many countries. However, {{little is known about the}} <b>real</b> <b>risks</b> of cross-transmission, specifically in the dental healthcare setting. This paper evaluated the literature to determine the risk of cross-transmission and infection of viruses and bacteria that are of particular relevance in the dental practice environment. Facts from the literature on HSV, VZV, HIV, Hepatitis B, C and D viruses, Mycobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp., Legionella spp. and multi-resistant bacteria are presented. There is evidence that Hepatitis B virus is a real threat for cross-infection in dentistry. Data for the transmission of, and infection with, other viruses or bacteria in dental practice are scarce. However, a number of cases are probably not acknowledged by patients, healthcare workers and authorities. Furthermore, cross-transmission in dentistry is under-reported in the literature. For the above reasons, the <b>real</b> <b>risks</b> of cross-transmission are likely to be higher. There is therefore a need for prospective longitudinal research in this area, to determine the <b>real</b> <b>risks</b> of cross-infection in dentistry. This will assist the adoption of effective hygiene procedures in dental practice...|$|R

25|$|In a {{judgment}} dated 3 November 2010, the High Court rejected the long-standing inherent tendency test and instead adopted the <b>real</b> <b>risk</b> test. It {{stated that the}} only available defence to scandalizing contempt was fair criticism, and explicitly rejected the common law defences of fair comment and justification applicable {{to the law of}} defamation. Upon the application of the <b>real</b> <b>risk</b> test, 11 out of the 14 impugned statements were found to be contemptuous.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal {{affirmed that}} the mens rea or mental element for {{liability}} was the intentional {{publication of the}} allegedly contemptuous statement. The Court then focused on the actus reus of the offence, and considered the legal principles for identifying the suitable test for liability for scandalizing contempt. In particular, the Court detailed {{the contents of the}} <b>real</b> <b>risk</b> test, the clear and present danger test, and the inherent tendency test. It held that the <b>real</b> <b>risk</b> test was the applicable test for scandalizing contempt in Singapore.|$|E

25|$|Other {{relevant}} {{considerations that}} may mitigate {{the severity of}} the sentence include the conduct of the respondent, for example, whether he argued against culpability, expressed regret over his conduct, and made an apology for his contempt of court. Although the <b>real</b> <b>risk</b> test has no bearing on liability, the likelihood that the respondent's acts or statements pose a <b>real</b> <b>risk</b> of harm to the administration of justice may be relevant for mitigation or aggravation of the punishment. These considerations are non-exhaustive and the importance and relevance of these factors is dependent on the facts of each case, although guidance may be drawn from previous cases.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} {{necessity to}} clean up polluted sites and to avoid additional soil pollution can be strongly supported by acknowledging the highly localized true contamination of soils.

25|$|Thirdly, the Court of Appeal {{cautioned that}} in {{applying}} the <b>real</b> <b>risk</b> test, the court must avoid either extreme {{on the legal}} spectrum.

25|$|The Court of Appeal {{differed}} from the High Court in holding that nine of the 11 statements were contemptuous.
