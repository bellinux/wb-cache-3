40|$|Millions of wild mammals {{are trapped}} {{annually}} for fur, pest control and wildlife management. Ensuring {{the welfare of}} trapped individuals can only be achieved by trapping methods that meet accepted standards of animal welfare. At the international level, the assessment of mechanical properties of killing and <b>restraining</b> <b>traps</b> is set out in two documents published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Few traps currently in use have been tested according to the ISO standards and, in addition, new traps have been designed and old traps modified {{since the publication of}} the standards. In this paper we review trapping methods used in Europe and North America to see whether they meet the ISO standards and examine ways to improve the welfare performance of traps. In addition, international legislation is assessed to determine whether this ensures a sufficient level of welfare for trapped animals. Finally, trapping practices used in academic research are reviewed. We conclude that many of the practices commonly used to trap mammals cannot be considered humane. Current legislation fails to ensure an acceptable level of welfare for a large number of captured animals. New welfare standards for trapping wild mammals need to be established so that in future a minimum level of welfare is guaranteed for all trapped individuals...|$|R
30|$|The {{adsorption}} isotherms curves reveal the typical behavior showing {{the effect of}} temperature on the CO 2 adsorption capacity. That is, an increase in adsorption temperature leads {{to a reduction in}} the amount of adsorbed CO 2. Rising temperature simply provides more internal energy to CO 2 molecules in the gas phase. It {{should be noted that the}} increasing energy allows gaseous molecules to diffuse at a greater rate, but, at the same time, it reduces the chance for the CO 2 to be <b>restrained</b> or <b>trapped</b> by fixed energy adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface.|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{literary}} modernism, value has been assigned most often to texts that display {{a certain kind of}} innovation: aggressive, destructive, and difficult. Other, quieter texts have been relegated to the periphery of the modernist canon. This dissertation, contributing to the work of the New Modernist Studies, argues for an expansion of how critics define innovation and, by extension, modernism. Through close reading and thorough analysis of critical reception, I explore a restrained modernism in the stories and novels of E. M. Forster, Nella Larsen, and Elizabeth Bowen, demonstrating how their innovation proceeds from and depends on their performance of clarity and their deconstruction of traditional forms from within. These three authors strategically deploy familiar traditions like the female bildungsroman, social satire, and the tragic mulatta tale in order to explore the queer agency of <b>restrained</b> subjectivities <b>trapped</b> inside. Forster, Larsen, and Bowen defy critical accusations of timidity, conservativism, and failure, critiquing the totalizing identity categories of nation, race, sexuality, and gender and suggesting the quiet yet radical power of a literary [...] and modernist [...] restraint...|$|R
50|$|The AIHTS {{establishes}} {{approval and}} certification standards {{for all types of}} traps and requires that traps be certified as meeting the AIHTS, initially by fall 2007. The Agreement prohibits the use of <b>restraining</b> and killing <b>traps</b> that are not certified in accordance with the Standards. However, it does not prevent individuals from constructing and using traps that comply with designs approved by the competent authorities. (Competent authorities are legal bodies that regulate trapping, including governments, government mandated agencies and those Aboriginal groups with authority to regulate wildlife management activities.) Traps not meeting the Agreement Standards must be phased out by the signatories. If there are no traps certified for a particular species, all traps legal for use for that species can continue to be used until certified traps become available and provided research continues to search for traps that meet the Agreement Standards.|$|R

40|$|Genetic and {{chemical}} biology screens of C. elegans {{have been of}} enormous benefit in providing fundamental insight into neural function and neuroactive drugs. Recently the exploitation of microfluidic devices has added greater power to this experimental approach providing more discrete and higher throughput phenotypic analysis of neural systems. Here we make a significant addition to this repertoire through {{the design of a}} semi-automated microfluidic device, NeuroChip, which has been optimised for selecting worms based on the electrophysiological features of the pharyngeal neural network. We demonstrate this device has the capability to sort mutant from wild-type worms based on high definition extracellular electrophysiological recordings. NeuroChip resolves discrete differences in excitatory, inhibitory and neuromodulatory components of the neural network from individual animals. Worms may be fed into the device consecutively from a reservoir and recovered unharmed. It combines microfluidics with integrated electrode recording for sequential <b>trapping,</b> <b>restraining,</b> recording, releasing and recovering of C. elegans. Thus mutant worms may be selected, recovered and propagated enabling mutagenesis screens based on an electrophysiological phenotype. Drugs may be rapidly applied during the recording thus permitting compound screening. For toxicology, this analysis can provide a precise description of sub-lethal effects on neural function. The chamber has been modified to accommodate L 2 larval stages showing applicability for small size nematodes including parasitic species which otherwise are not tractable to this experimenta...|$|R
40|$|Polyphagous generalist tephritids {{are often}} pests in both their native ranges and when {{introduced}} to other tropic and subtropic areas. Anastrepha suspensa (Lowe) {{commonly known as}} the Caribbean fruit fly (Caribfly), indigenous to the Greater Antilles, infests over 100 fruit species. There is a potential to use argumentatively released parasitoids, particularly opine braconids, to biologically control this and other tephritids pests worldwide. While adult ability to find both food and hosts is {{critical to the success of}} such programs little is known about the feeding and chemical ecology of this group of insects. Three opiine fruit fly parasitoids: Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead), Doryctobracon areolatus (Szepligeti) and Utetes anastrephae (Viereck) have been used in the control of A. suspensa in Florida and in other locations. Adult parasitoids feed on extrafloral nectars, hemipteran-honeydews and on fruit juices as they seep from injured fruit. The ability to exploit fruit juice would allow the parasitoids to efficiently forage for hosts and food sources simultaneously. Chemical cues from the parasitoids' hosts and the substrates in and on which the hosts develop are known, or are hypothesized to be, fundamental components of orientation during foraging for adult food, oviposition opportunities and perhaps mating sites. Compounds produced by the larvae have not been previously described nor their significance to parasitoid foraging determined. Volatiles collected from four species of tropical and subtropical Tephritidae were identified. Para-ethylacetophenone, an analog of a known tephritid parasitoid attractant, was a major constituent of all four species and was not associated with larvae of non tephritid flies. Mass-rearing and augmentative release of tephritid fruit fly parasitoids has great promise, particularly in conjunction with sterile males and in areas where insecticides cannot be widely applied. Currently there are no means to monitor the survival and dispersal of fruit fly parasitoids following release. Isolation of specific volatile components in fruit juices and the larval host that stimulates long range attraction would be a first step in the identification of effective synthetic attractants. A reliable trap that uses an effective attractant, is efficient over time, and will <b>restrain</b> the <b>trapped</b> insects for monitoring needs to be developed...|$|R
40|$|Badgers (Meles meles) {{have long}} been implicated in the {{transmission}} of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and as a result, {{a considerable amount of}} time, effort and money have been invested in TB research programmes and control policies. The majority of these operations require badgers to be <b>restrained</b> in cage <b>traps.</b> Three distinct â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 populationsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 (each containing four independent social groups) that had different levels of prior feeding experience (habituated, semi-habituated and naÃ¯ve) were selected in the south west of England. The 12 setts were filmed using remote infra-red CCTV cameras over the duration of their pre-baiting period and the subsequent behaviour exhibited by the badgers was observed. In addition, the behaviour of badgers once captured was analysed according to the number of times an individual had been caught previously. The results from this research suggests that the pre-baiting period affects badgersâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 behaviour towards traps and its bait source and that they will respond differently within this period due to differences in habituation to prior feeding. As the pre-baiting period continued, the semi-habituated and naÃ¯ve badgers became more accustomed to the presence of the trap, which was shown by differences in bait and trap interaction times (an increase in bait interaction and a decrease in trap interaction) and a decrease in time from when a badger was first observed to when a badger would first enter a trap. Artificial feeding did not appear to affect group relations as aggressive encounters were limited. From an animal welfare point of view this research has highlighted that badgers only spend, on average, 37...|$|R
