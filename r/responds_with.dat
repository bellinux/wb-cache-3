5000|$|Most {{local media}} {{initially}} <b>responded</b> <b>with</b> cautious optimism to the announced coalition, though the Spokesman-Review <b>responded</b> <b>with</b> skepticism. Democratic leaders denounced the MCC as [...] "the {{exact opposite of}} collaboration" [...] and denied that it was bi-partisan.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} quarter, the Predators struck first with Kicker Jorge Cimadevilla getting a 48-yard Field Goal. The Drive <b>responded</b> <b>with</b> FB/LB Broderick Sargent getting a one-yard {{touchdown}} run. Afterwards, Orlando <b>responded</b> <b>with</b> Cimadevilla kicking a 36-yard Field Goal.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} quarter, the Bears drew first blood as QB Kyle Orton {{completed}} a 19-yard TD pass to TE Greg Olsen. The Eagles <b>responded</b> <b>with</b> McNabb completing a 22-yard TD pass to WR DeSean Jackson. In the second quarter, Chicago <b>responded</b> <b>with</b> Orton completing a 23-yard TD pass to WR Marty Booker. Philadelphia <b>responded</b> <b>with</b> RB Correll Buckhalter getting a 1-yard TD run. The Bears closed out the half with Orton completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR/KR Devin Hester.|$|R
5|$|Another example {{occurs in}} the French Defense after 1.e4 e6 2.e5, a move once {{advocated}} by Wilhelm Steinitz. If Black <b>responds</b> <b>with</b> 2...d5, White can capture the pawn enpassant with 3.exd6. Likewise, White can answer 2...f5 with 3.exf6e.p.|$|E
5|$|PING asks {{a device}} {{if it is}} ready to receive an OUT/DATA packet pair. PING is usually sent by a host when polling a device that most {{recently}} responded with NAK or NYET. This avoids the need to send a large data packet to a device that the host suspects to be unwilling to accept it. The device <b>responds</b> <b>with</b> ACK, NAK, or STALL, as appropriate.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was {{not so long ago}} that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black <b>responds</b> <b>with</b> the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E

5|$|In {{the poem}} Lokasenna, the half-god Loki angrily flyts with the gods {{in the sea}} entity Ægir's hall. Thor does not attend the event, however, as he is away in the east for {{unspecified}} purposes. Towards {{the end of the}} poem, the flyting turns to Sif, Thor's wife, whom Loki then claims to have slept with. The god Freyr's servant Beyla interjects, and says that, since all of the mountains are shaking, she thinks that Thor is on his way home. Beyla adds that Thor will bring peace to the quarrel, to which Loki <b>responds</b> <b>with</b> insults.|$|E
5|$|Freyr arrives {{home and}} neither sleeps nor drinks, {{remaining}} in silence. No one dares speak to him. The god Njörðr sends Freyr's servant Skírnir {{to speak to}} Freyr. Freyr tells Skírnir that he saw a beautiful woman, so beautiful that he was filled with grief {{and that he would}} soon die if he could not have her. Freyr tells Skírnir that he must go gain her hand on his behalf—whether the woman's father agrees or not—and he will be rewarded. Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off. Skírnir asks for the woman's hand for Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later she is to meet with Freyr at a location called Barey. Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr <b>responds</b> <b>with</b> the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál, lamenting that he must wait.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Windows Push Notification Service {{is similar to that}} of its predecessor, in that it consists of servers and interfaces that generate, maintain, store, and authenticate unique identifiers (called Channel URI Identifiers) for all devices that register to use the service. When a device enrolls to receive data and notification information using the WNS, it first sends a device registration request to WNS network. The WNS network acknowledges the request, and <b>responds</b> <b>with</b> the device's unique Channel URI Identifier. Typically, the device will then send its identifier to a server owned by the developer so that it can be stored and used for sending notifications. When the app developer wishes to transmit a notification or other WNS data to the device, it will transmit a POST request to the WNS network. The network will acknowledge and authenticate the request. If the authentication succeeds, the data to be transmitted is enqueued and then sent to the device from the WNS network using the Channel URI Identifier.|$|E
