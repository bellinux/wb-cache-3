40|$|Synchronous {{generators}} {{form the}} principal source of electrical energy in power system. Many large loads {{are driven by}} synchronous motors. For stability studies of large power systems, accurate representation of the synchronous machine is required.

Rotating machines are considered sources of harmonics because the windings are embedded in slots which are not perfectly sinusoidally distributed resulting in a distorted mmf. Nonsinusoidal voltage applied to electric machines may cause overheating, pulsating torques or noise. In additional to cross the line applications, adjustable speed drive motors are fed from inverter that can produce significant voltage distortion.
