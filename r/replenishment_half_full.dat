30|$|Several {{important}} aspects critical to Billie’s understanding of empty, <b>full</b> and <b>half</b> <b>full</b> {{were identified in}} this task. He was able to match the words <b>half</b> <b>full</b> {{with the image of}} a <b>half</b> <b>full</b> bottle. He could match the full bottle with the word full by seeing the item, however Billie saw that two bottles were full stating “both bottles are full and no bottle is empty”. Whilst Billie was able to identify the “half” shaded area in the <b>half</b> <b>full</b> bottle, {{he was not able to}} differentiate which bottles was full and empty using the shading as a guide.|$|R
