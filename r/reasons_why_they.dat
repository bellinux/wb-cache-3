5|$|The DOB {{spread to}} Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, and The Ladder {{was mailed to}} hundreds—eventually thousands—of DOB members {{discussing}} the nature of homosexuality, sometimes challenging {{the idea that it}} was a sickness, with readers offering their own <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were lesbians, and suggesting ways to cope with the condition or society's response to it. British lesbians followed with the publication of Arena Three beginning in 1964, with a similar mission.|$|E
25|$|The vǫlur {{were known}} for their art of seduction, {{which was one of}} the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were {{considered}} dangerous. One of the stanzas in Hávamál warns against sexual intercourse with a woman who is skilled in magic, because the one who does so runs the risk of being caught in a magic bond and also risks getting ill. Freyja, who is the mistress of seiðr, has a free sexual life that gives her a bad reputation in certain myths.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial began}} with opening {{statements}} by Theodore Olson and San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Therese Stewart for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs sought {{to show that}} marriage is a fundamental right; that depriving gays and lesbians {{of the right to}} marry hurts them and their children; {{and that there was no}} reason or societal benefit in prohibiting them from getting married. Charles J. Cooper made an opening statement for the defendants, saying that marriage had been universally limited to opposite-sex couples. The plaintiffs then testified about their personal experiences as gay Americans, and the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> wished to marry.|$|E

25|$|Many Acadians {{might have}} signed an {{unconditional}} oath to the British monarchy had the circumstances been better, while other Acadians did not sign {{because they were}} clearly anti-British. For the Acadians who might have signed an unconditional oath, there were numerous <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> did not. The difficulty was partly religious, in that the British monarch {{was the head of}} the (Protestant) Church of England. Another significant issue was that an oath might commit male Acadians to fight against France during wartime. A related concern was whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive this as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than the Mi'kmaq. As a result, signing an unconditional oath might have put Acadian villages in dangers of attack from Mi'kmaq.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} main <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> chose the {{governorate}} of Arbil. Firstly, it was geographically {{closer to the}} original Nochiya Region than other areas like Dohuk. Secondly, there was some friction with other tribes, namely the Lower Tyari tribe, which chose the Dohuk province since it too was closer to their former Turkish district. Thirdly, {{it was at the}} suggestion of Ishmael Beg of Rawandiz and Said Taha of Nehri, who, by then, had been appointed governor of the Rawandiz District. They had settled in Batas and invited Mar Yosip Khnanisho to be their new neighbor again since they shared clan territories pre-1915. A fourth reason may have been because there were also other, more friendly Assyrian tribes in the region such as the Rawandiz, Bradost and Sherwan.|$|E
25|$|In January 20, 2011, the {{management}} of the Energy Boosters announced that they will take a leave of absence for the upcoming Commissioner's Cup {{to make way for the}} Smart Gilas Philippine national team. The application was eventually approved during the team owners meeting on January 24. The players of the squad will be put on a conditional dispersal draft on February 7, then after the Commissioner's Cup is finished, all of these players will return to Barako Bull, if the team will eventually return. The owners announced on March 20 that they do not intend to return to the season-ending Governors Cup. In a letter sent to PBA Commissioner Chito Salud, the owners of the Barako Bull franchise mentioned their ongoing legal battle against TC Pharmaceuticals Industries, Co. the manufacturer of Red Bull in Thailand, and the death of one of their owners, Tony Chua during the onslaught of Typhoon Ketsana in 2009 as the main <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> will leave the PBA.|$|E

25|$|Despite their {{doubts about}} the strategy, the leaders of Liverpool City Council were keen not to damage {{the unity of the}} campaign; after the {{previous}} year's experience the council believed there was no legal requirement to set a rate until June. Accordingly, on budget day in 1985, Liverpool's Finance Committee chairman Tony Byrne stated that the council needed a £265m budget, but because the Government grant penalties restricted them to £222m, the council would not set a rate. There was one significant change from the past year, as the Audit Commission had appointed Tim McMahon as the new District Auditor for Liverpool at the beginning of May 1985. McMahon wrote to all councillors on 21 May warning them that not setting a rate {{by the end of the}} month would result in an extraordinary audit and asking them individually for <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> should not be surcharged. The council's leadership believed that the deadline really was 20 June, and had pencilled in a meeting on 14 June for setting a rate.|$|E
25|$|Many {{students}} {{listen to}} music while they study. Many of these students maintain that the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> {{listen to music}} are to prevent drowsiness and to maintain their arousal for study. Some even believe that background music facilitates better work performance. However, Salame and Baddeley (1989) showed that both vocal and instrumental music interfered with performance of linguistic memory. They explained that disturbance in performance was caused by task-irrelevant phonological information using resources in the working memory system. This disturbance {{can be explained by}} the fact that the linguistic component of music can occupy the phonological loop, similar to the way speech does. This is further demonstrated by the fact that vocal music has been perceived to interfere more with memory than instrumental music and nature sound music. Rolla (1993) explains that lyrics, being language, develop images that allow for the interpretation of experience in the communicative process. Current research coincides with this idea and maintains that the sharing of experience by language in song may communicate feeling and mood much more directly than either language itself or instrumental music alone. Vocal music also affects emotion and mood much more swiftly than instrumental music. However, Fogelson (1973) reported instrumental music interfered with children's performance on a reading comprehension test.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{between the}} LB and the SER and the {{interpretation}} of the 1848 agreement continued to be difficult throughout the 1850s and 1860s. They reached a low point in 1863 when the SER produced a report for shareholders outlining a long list of the difficulties between the two companies, and the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> considered that the LB had broken the 1848 agreement. The main areas of disagreement listed were at Hastings, allowing the LC to use its lines to Victoria, a proposed LB branch to Bromley, a proposed agreement by the LB to work the Caterham branch, the new LB line to Dorking, LB opposition to the SER attempts at building a line to the west end, the LB agreement to let the LC use its goods facilities at Bricklayers' Arms, and the perennial problem of the shared main line between Redhill and Croydon. However, the chronic congestion over the shared line north of Redhill railway station eased after 1 May 1868 when the route ceased to be on the South Eastern Main Line to Dover following the opening of the 'Sevenoaks cut off' line between St Johns and Tonbridge railway station. A ten-year agreement between the SER and the LBSCR over the use of the station and lines to Coulsdon was signed 1 February 1869 and renewed ten years later.|$|E

The pair confessed to needing the money acquired from Gina's murder to fund a killing spree, which would include purchasing two Ghostface costumes, as well as a voice-changer used by the character in the film. During their trial, psychologist Madeline Levine who studied the effect of violence on children, stated, [...] "There were a whole bunch of <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> acted out that way.

500|$|The Human Rights Act 1998, {{which came}} into force in 2000, brought the European Convention on Human Rights into British {{domestic}} law.

As such, Section 12 of the Act provides that, if a court is considering whether to grant relief which infringes on the right to freedom of expression (such as an injunction), it must [...] "have particular regard to the importance of the Convention right to freedom of expression", although recognising the other limits put on this right. Where a relief (such as an injunction) is granted {{in the absence of the}} respondent, the court must be satisfied that the claimant has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the defendant was notified, unless there are compelling <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> should not be.

[...] Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is You, came from Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, [...] "We named it that because ...

While many of these unexpected combinations have been critically well received, Blumenthal himself has pointed out the limitations of such an approach, insisting that although foodpairing is a good tool for creativity, it is still no substitute for the chef’s culinary intuition. ‘The molecular profile of a single ingredient is so complex that even if it has several compounds in common with another, there are still as many <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> won’t work together as <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> will.’ ...|$|E
