Research has also shown that on moors managed for grouse shooting, ground nesting birds such as curlew and lapwing, both of which are species of the highest conservation concern in the UK, are 3.5 times more likely to raise a chick to fledgling stage. Studies on a former grouse moor in Berwyn found that within 20 years of grouse moor management ending lapwing became extinct at the site, golden plover declined by 90 per cent, and curlew declined by 79 per cent.|$|E

40|$|Title: Notification {{of animal}} welfare Author: Helen Öhlund The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the {{routines}} of the county administrations in Sweden when it comes to receiving notification from the public about the welfare of animals. According to Jordbruksverket at least 50 % of the screening of animal welfare should be based on <b>routine</b> <b>controls</b> on existing farmers. Today the <b>routine</b> <b>controls</b> only reach a 43 % average for the whole country. A big part of today’s result depends on the amount of time it takes the administrators of animal welfare to process the notifications from the public. To examine why the notifications from the public take too long time, the county administrations were interviewed through phone and e-mail. The interviews were made to see what routines the county administrations had and if the routines could be made more efficient. Jordbruksverket have developed aid to the county administrations in form of simpler checklists for pets and control cards to ease the burden in notification controls. This study shows that a lot of work can be done when it comes to receiving the notification. When receiving notification the administrators can decide if the notification is severe or not. Too little information makes it difficult to determine the gravity of the notification.   Key words: animal welfare, legislation, county administration, notification, Jordbruksverket...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} cross-level interactions among subordinate and supervisor characteristics on subordinates’ work-family conflict. It was hypothesized that subordinates’ job demands, job control (autonomy, workgroup control, task and <b>routine</b> <b>control)</b> and support (organizational support and supervisor support) would be related to subordinates’ reports of work-family conflict. It was further hypothesized that supervisor characteristics (supervisor’ job demands, supervisors’ job control, supervisors’ managers’ support for supervisors’ work-family issues and supervisors’ organizational support for supervisors’ work-family issues) would be related to the relationship between subordinates’ supervisor support for subordinates’ work-family issues and subordinates’ work-family conflict. One hundred and eighty-seven employees working in a manufacturing plant in the Midwest and their 28 supervisors were surveyed. Intra-class correlation (ICC) was found to be less than 1 % for the outcome variable. This indicated that much of the variation in the outcome variable, work-family conflict, was due to individual-level characteristics. Organizational Support and task and <b>routine</b> <b>control</b> had a negative and significant relationship with work-family conflict as reported by hourly wage earners working in a manufacturing plant. ...|$|E

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} between 2001 and 2003 to determine {{the efficacy of the}} NegFry, Simphyt, ProPhy and Plant Plus decision support systems (DSS) in controlling late blight of potatoes compared with routine fungicide treatments. The {{experiments were}} also used to determine the potential of the systems to reduce fungicide inputs. Over the three year period of the experiment the 7 -day routine programme received an average of 13. 7 fungicide applications while the DSS programmes varied between 5. 7 and 12. 3 applications. All decision support systems resulted in a {{reduction in the number of}} fungicide application (Fig. 2). Compared with the <b>routine</b> <b>control,</b> the NegFry and SimPhyt programmes resulted in a 58 - 44 % reduction in application frequency. The ProPhy and Plant Plus programmes resulted in more modest savings of between 10 and 25 % (Tables 1 & 2). All fungicide treatments significantly delayed the date of disease onset compared with the untreated control. Compared with the <b>routine</b> <b>control</b> treatment, the NegFry and Plant Plus significantly delayed disease onset in King Edward in 2001 as did NegFry and ProPhy in Rooster. In 2002 there were no differences between treatments in terms of delaying disease onset, while in 2003, disease developed significantly earlier the Plant Plus programme compared with the <b>routine</b> <b>control.</b> In general, the date of disease onset was not significantly different between routine programmes and DSS programmes irrespective of the cultivar. In each of the three years, all fungicide treatments significantly reduced the incidence of foliage blight at the end of the season compared with the untreated control. When compared with the <b>routine</b> <b>control,</b> no decision support system resulted in significantly more foliage blight at the end of the season, irrespective of the cultivar or year. Similar results were achieved when the treatments were compared using the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). These results would confirm that none of the DSS’s resulted in inferior disease control when compared with the 7 -day routine application of fluazinam. All fungicide treatments resulted in significantly higher marketable yields compared with the untreated control in all years, irrespective of the variety. Within the fungicide treatments the DSS programmes generally out-yielded the routine fungicide treatment. However, these differences were only significant for Plant-Plus in King Edward in 2001. Within the DSS treatments there were no significant differences in marketable yield in any of the years or either of the varieties. Within the fungicide treatments there were no significant differences between treatments in terms of tuber blight control for the resistant variety Rooster. In the case of the more susceptible variety, King Edward, all the DSS programmes resulted in significantly lower levels of tuber blight than the routine Shirlan control in 2001 except for Simphyt. More importantly, the routine Shilan did not result in significantly better tuber blight control in any of the years when compared with any of the DSS programmes. This confirms that all DSS programmes give equivalent tuber blight control to the routine Shirlan application at 7 -day intervals even with a very tuber blight susceptible variety.
