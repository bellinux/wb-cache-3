2500|$|A {{wide range}} of {{projections}} of future GHG emissions have been produced. <b>Rogner</b> et al. (2007) assessed the scientific literature on GHG projections. <b>Rogner</b> et al. (2007) concluded that unless energy policies changed substantially, the world would continue to depend on fossil fuels until 2025–2030. Projections suggest that more than 80% of the world's energy will come from fossil fuels. This conclusion was based on [...] "much evidence" [...] and [...] "high agreement" [...] in the literature. Projected annual energy-related [...] emissions in 2030 were 40–110% higher than in 2000, with two-thirds of the increase originating in developing countries. Projected annual per capita emissions in developed country regions remained substantially lower (2.8–5.1 tonnes [...] ) than those in developed country regions (9.6–15.1 tonnes [...] ). Projections consistently showed increase in annual world GHG emissions (the [...] "Kyoto" [...] gases, measured in -equivalent) of 25–90% by 2030, compared to 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Hans-Holger <b>Rogner,</b> {{a section}} {{head at the}} IAEA, warned in 1997 {{that the level of}} {{incentive}} required for market driven research and development will actually rise. [...] Because production costs are not expected to decrease and because of the continued emphasis companies give to short-term profits, [...] "a regional breakdown for 11 world regions indicates that neither hydrocarbon resource availability nor costs are likely to become forces that automatically would help wean the global energy system from the use of fossil fuel during the next century." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Rogner</b> et al. (2007) {{reported}} that the then-current estimated total atmospheric concentration of long-lived GHGs was around 455 parts-per-million (ppm) -eq (range: 433-477 ppm -eq). The effects of aerosol and land-use changes (e.g., deforestation) reduced the physical effect (the radiative forcing) of this to 311 to 435 ppm -eq, with a central estimate of about 375 ppm -eq.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{climate change}} caused by CO The {{assumptions}} on resource availability are in SRES based on <b>Rogner’s</b> assessment of world hydrocarbon resources from 1997, {{where it is}} stated that "the sheer size of the fossil resource base makes fossil sources an energy supply option for many centuries to come". Regarding the future coal production it is simply assumed {{to be dependent on}} economics, accessibility, and environmental acceptance. It is also generally assumed that coal is abundant, and will thus take a dominating part in the future energy system. Depletion, geographical location and geological parameters are not given much influence in the scenario storylines. This study quantifies what the coal production projection in SRES would imply in reality. SRES is riddled with future production projections that would put unreasonable expectation on just a few countries or regions. Is it reasonable to expect that China, among the world’s largest coal reserve and resource holder and producer, would increase their production by a factor of 8 over the next 90 years, as implied by certain scenarios? Can massive increases in global coal output really be justified from historical trends or will reality rule out some production outlooks as implausible? The fundamental assumptions regarding future fossil fuel production in SRES was investigated and compared with scientific methodology regarding reasonable future production trajectories. Historical data from the past 20 years was used to test how well the production scenarios agree with actual reality. Some of the scenarios turned out to mismatch with reality, and should be ruled out. Given the importance of coal utilization as a source of anthropogenic GHG emissions it is necessary to use realistic production trajectories that incorporate geological and physical data as well as socioeconomic parameters. SRES is underpinned by a paradigm of perpetual growth and technological optimism as well as old and outdated estimates regarding the availability of fossil energy. This has resulted in overoptimistic production outlooks. 2 emissions is strongly and fundamentally linked to the future energy production. The Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) from 2000 contains 40 scenarios for future fossil fuel production and is used by the IPCC to assess future climate change. Coal, with its 26 % share of world energy, is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and commonly seen as a key contributor to anthropogenic climate change. SRES contains a wide array of different coal production outlooks, ranging from a complete coal phase-out by 2100 to a roughly tenfold increase from present world production levels. Scenarios with high levels of global warming also have high expectations on future fossil fuel production. Proceeding avaliable on CD-ROM only...|$|R
2500|$|Changes {{in future}} {{greenhouse}} gas emission levels are highly uncertain, and {{a wide range of}} quantitative emission projections have been produced. <b>Rogner</b> et al. (2007) assessed these projections. Some of these projections aggregate anthropogenic emissions into a single figure as a [...] "carbon dioxide equivalent" [...] (-eq). By 2030, baseline scenarios projected an increase in greenhouse emissions (the F-gases, nitrous oxide, methane, and , measured in -eq) of between 25% and 90%, relative to the 2000 level. For [...] only, two-thirds to three-quarters of the increase in emissions was projected to come from developing countries, although the average per capita [...] emissions in developing country regions were projected to remain substantially lower than those in developed country regions.|$|E
