25|$|In Jack's Manual (1910) {{there is}} another {{cocktail}} called The Alexander which {{is a mixture of}} <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey</b> and Bénédictine. It is unclear whether or not this has any relation to the cream-based version.|$|E
5000|$|Current {{products}} include [...] "white" [...] {{wheat and}} <b>rye</b> <b>whiskeys,</b> {{as well as}} a Dutch-style ginever, wheat and <b>rye</b> <b>whiskeys</b> aged in small casks, organic bitters, and a rum-like spirit distilled from buckwheat honey. Each month they feature an experimental, limited-edition spirit called Wigle's Whim. Wigle also sells small oak barrels for customers to age their own whiskey in a small cask.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Queen City Whiskey started {{producing}} {{small batch}} bourbon and <b>rye</b> <b>whiskeys</b> named after George Remus. The whiskey was distilled locally and was being introduced in liquor stores and select bars throughout the Cincinnati region.|$|R

25|$|If one {{of these}} whiskey types reaches two years aging or beyond, it is {{additionally}} designated as straight, e.g., straight <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey.</b> A whiskey that fulfils all above requirements but derives from less than 51% of any one specific grain can be called simply a straight whiskey without naming a grain.|$|E
25|$|Juuri (root in Finnish) {{is a new}} make single malt <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey,</b> {{which began}} {{production}} in 2014. It {{won a gold medal}} in the Whiskey category of the International Spirit Awards (ISW) 2016. Additionally, Kyrö produces small batch experiments developed by external beverage experts under the Kyrö Study label, such as the Smoke & Rye spirit—and since 2016 together with Finnish brewery Laitilan Wirvoitusjuomatehdas, a cranberry long drink with Napue gin as its base called Long Kyrö.|$|E
25|$|Kyrö Distillery distils whiskey, gin {{and other}} spirits from 100 % whole-grain rye in regular and small batches at its {{distillery}} in Isokyrö. At first, Kyrö {{was supposed to}} produce solely <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey,</b> but instead started with gin due to the minimum three years single malt whiskey is to be aged under European Union regulations. For gin products, the rye gin {{is used as a}} base with different herbs added to it. Due to the short summer in Finland, the staff distills individual botanical concentrates from locally foraged herbs in order to produce gin year-round.|$|E
50|$|Examples of <b>rye</b> malt <b>whiskey</b> are {{primarily}} American, such as Old Pogue, North American Steamship Rye or Old Potrero brands.|$|R
5000|$|The inaugural {{event in}} 2007 focused on {{featuring}} <b>whiskeys,</b> <b>ryes</b> and vodkas, which {{are meant to}} be consumed [...] "neat." [...] The theme was the Whiskey Rebellion, an important event in Western Pennsylvania history, with information on the history of <b>ryes</b> and <b>whiskeys.</b> [...] In 2008, the offerings were expanded to include cocktails, [...] That year, the sponsors sought to reach the female demographic. [...] The 2009 event sought to reach an even broader audience, especially younger individuals. [...] The 2010 event had a speakeasy decor, with a new focus on cigars.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Whiskey Bottom Road" [...] has {{inspired}} adjoining roads, schools, developments and businesses {{to adopt the}} whiskey theme or the entire name. The region is better known for producing a <b>rye</b> based <b>Whiskey,</b> [...] "Maryland Rye", but that name has not been adopted in the neighborhoods. Nearby Bourbon street is based on another whiskey variation, Bourbon, that has a corn base.|$|R
500|$|Although the Algonquin was [...] "dry" [...] {{even before}} Prohibition (Case closed the hotel bar in 1917 and had harsh words {{for those who}} ran speakeasies), the hotel does have an eponymous cocktail, {{composed}} of <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey,</b> Noilly Prat and pineapple juice. More recently, a newer drink has hit the Algonquin's menu, the $10,000 Martini or [...] "Martini on the Rock," [...] consisting of a martini of the buyer's choice with {{a single piece of}} [...] "ice," [...] a diamond, {{at the bottom of the}} glass. The martini was developed to mark completion of a major 29-day renovation that closed the hotel for the first time since its opening. Hoy Wong was a notable bartender at the hotel and was the oldest person to hold such a position in the state, serving at the Algonquin for 30 years until retiring in 2009, well past the age of 90.|$|E
500|$|Today, Laird is the nation's only {{remaining}} producer of applejack. Presently {{none of the}} company's distilling takes place in New Jersey. Laird's obtains all its apples from Virginia's Shenandoah Valley and distills its products in Virginia. Distilling at its New Jersey facilities ceased in 1972 and Laird's blends, ages and bottles its products in Scobeyville. [...] In February 2013, the state issued the first distillery license since Prohibition to Jersey Artisan Distilling of Fairfield, which currently produces and sells rum. [...] set up their craft distillery in February, 2015 also located in Fairfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey {{and became the first}} distillery to manufacture and distribute a true Bourbon Whiskey completely in New Jersey since before Prohibition days. Their handmade grain to bottle products include Vodka, Rum, Gin, White Whiskey, Bourbon and Jersey Hooch. [...] in Fairfield, NJ began distilling in May 2015. They're producing vodka, whiskey, and a retail moonshine called Jersey Devil Moonshine, after the New Jersey Pine Barons legend.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to conventional bourbons, <b>ryes,</b> and <b>whiskeys,</b> the label also produces some other noteworthy products. Jefferson's Ocean was initially an experimental bottling before being made a standard offering. Barrels of bourbon aged 6-7 years are loaded onto ships, which then sail {{around the world}} for six months, a process that Jefferson's claims develops the bourbon more quickly through the motion of the waves (45% ABV) ...|$|R

5000|$|... ==History== In 1800, Henry Overholt (1739-1813) {{moved to}} southwestern Pennsylvania from Bucks County,Pennsylvania. He {{is known for}} being the great {{grandfather}} of Henry Clay Frick. His son, Abraham Overholt, gave Frick an introduction to successful business operation. The family homestead is located near to Scottdale, Pennsylvania, {{in the small town}} of West Overton where there originally was a farm and distillery. The family processed <b>rye</b> into <b>whiskey</b> they grew on the farm.|$|R
2500|$|While Buffalo Trace Distillery {{is mainly}} {{known for its}} bourbon, it also {{produces}} other spirits such as <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey</b> and vodka. [...] "Buffalo Trace" [...] is a bourbon brand made by the Distillery. It was introduced in August 1999, {{two months after the}} distillery changed its name from the George T. Stagg Distillery. Approximately 25–30 barrels are selected and mixed before bottling. It has won several awards since its introduction.|$|E
2500|$|Bhakta {{founded the}} WhistlePig brand of <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey,</b> which was {{initially}} launched as a non-distiller producer that bottled Canadian whisky from the Alberta Premium distillery owned by Fortune Brands (Jim Beam) in Alberta, Canada. Starting in 2007, he purchased land in Vermont {{on which he}} built a new distillery and aging facility for the brand. The brand was launched {{on the market in}} 2010. It currently includes expressions aged 10, 12, 14, and 15 years, and an expression called [...] "Farmstock" [...] with no age statement. The Farmstock expression is produced at the new distillery in Vermont, while the others are bottlings of products distilled elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|Once the {{gristmill}} {{was well}} established, Washington’s farm manager, James Anderson, suggested building a whiskey distillery {{adjacent to the}} mill. [...] When it was completed in 1797, the distillery was the largest in America. By 1799 it {{had become one of}} Washington’s most successful enterprises, producing 11,000 gallons of whiskey per year. A variety of whiskeys were produced at the site along with brandy and vinegar. The most common whiskey recipe used 60% rye, 35% corn, and 5% malted barley. Smaller amounts of <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey</b> were distilled up to four times and were more expensive. Some whiskey was also flavored with cinnamon. When rye was scarce the distillery used wheat. Apple, peach and persimmon brandies were also produced. The whiskey was marketed in Alexandria, Virginia, or shipped directly from Mount Vernon’s dock on the Potomac River. The distillery process produced a significant waste stream, which was fed to 150 cattle and 30 hogs that were kept at the site.|$|E
50|$|Made {{from floor}} malted barley and <b>rye.</b> The <b>whiskey</b> is {{fermented}} {{to a lower}} terminal specific gravity to preserve delicate grain flavors and then distilled twice through the Double Diamond potstill {{in the manner of}} Scotch whisky. The resulting spirit is then aged first in recently decanted red wine barrels and then finished in very small medium toast American white oak barrels. The resulting whiskey is light gold in color and has a flavor profile that bears some similarity to better Irish Whiskey. The whiskey is packaged at 80 proof (40% alcohol).|$|R
5000|$|In fact, Templeton <b>Rye</b> brand <b>whiskey</b> is {{distilled}} and aged in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, by MGP of Indiana using {{a recipe}} shared with other brands. It {{is combined with}} an [...] "alcohol flavoring formulation" [...] from Clarendon Flavor Engineers, and finally bottled at an Iowa facility. Pursuant to a class action settlement announced in 2015, Templeton will add the words [...] "distilled in Indiana" [...] to the label and remove claims of [...] "Prohibition Era Recipe" [...] and [...] "Small Batch". The settlement also affords refunds to customers who bought Templeton Rye since 2006.|$|R
50|$|Willow Springs {{produced}} {{a variety of}} alcohol and spirits, including gins, pure <b>rye</b> and bourbon <b>whiskeys,</b> mash and sweet mash. When Prohibition in the United States stopped the production of alcoholic beverages in 1919, the company became known as Willow Springs Bottling and featured only near beer, malt and soda pop.|$|R

Let that fellow sit up and talk over a glass of <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey</b> and a bad cigar and he's right there; set him wrestling with a tough job and he'll double up." ...|$|E
5000|$|After his {{admission}} to the New York State Bar in 1983, Magliocco began {{a career in the}} wine and spirits industry. In the 1990s with [...] "brown" [...] spirits in decline and <b>rye,</b> America's first <b>whiskey,</b> on the verge of extinction, Magliocco teamed up with former Austin Nichols president Dick Newman [...] to resurrect Michter's, a whiskey brand that traces its legacy back to America's first whiskey company.|$|R
5000|$|This {{cocktail}} {{first appeared}} in Harry MacElhone's 1922 book, ABC of Mixing Cocktails. In the book he says the drink was invented by Sparrow Robertson, the Sporting editor of the New York Herald, in Paris. The drink possibly fell out of MacElhone's repertoire by 1927, when he published his next book, Barflies and Cocktails. In this book he swapped the <b>Rye</b> for Bourbon <b>whiskey,</b> and renamed the drink the [...] "Boulevardier". Although possibly being abandoned by MacElhone, the recipe was published again in Harry Craddock's 1930 cocktail book, The Savoy Cocktail Book.|$|R
5000|$|Characteristically boilo has a {{standard}} recipe including citrus fruits (such as oranges and lemons), {{herbs and spices}} (such as nutmeg, cloves, caraway seed, and anise seed), and other ingredients such as honey and ginger ale. The traditional base ingredient in boilo is moonshine. Many modern recipes have replaced home-brewed moonshine with blended <b>whiskey,</b> <b>rye</b> or grain alcohol, and may be made on a stove top or in a slow cooker. [...] Some recipes specify Four Queens whiskey. Variations on the traditional recipe include honeyberry boilo, [...] "tomata" [...] boilo, blueberry boilo, and apple pie boilo. Some traditions recommend that holiday music and decorating accompany the cooking process, {{to add to the}} festive effect of the beverage.|$|R

"Gentlemen," [...] he said, as {{he paused}} half way in his speech,--"while we are {{gathered}} here in earnest discussion, {{do you know}} what is happening over at the meeting place of our opponents? Do you know that seventeen bottles of <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey</b> were sent out from the town this afternoon to that innocent and unsuspecting school house?

60|$|Mr. Rasselyer-Brown himself, {{though never}} exactly an invalid, had confessed {{that after all}} the fuss of the Yahi-Bahi {{business}} he needed bracing up, needed putting into shape, and had put himself into Dr. Slyder's hands. The doctor had examined him, questioned him searchingly as to what he drank, and ended by prescribing port wine to be taken firmly and unflinchingly during the evening, and for the daytime, at any moment of exhaustion, a light cordial such as <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey,</b> or rum and Vichy water. In addition to which Dr. Slyder had recommended Mr. Rasselyer-Brown to leave town.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bill Humble, an {{old friend}} of mine in the Territories, {{conceived}} the illusion {{that he wanted to be}} appointed United States Marshall. At that time me and Andy was doing a square, legitimate business of selling walking canes. If you unscrewed the head of one and turned it up to your mouth a half pint of good <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey</b> would go trickling down your throat to reward you for your act of intelligence. The deputies was annoying me and Andy some, and when Bill spoke to me about his officious aspirations, I saw how the appointment as Marshall might help along the firm of Peters & Tucker.|$|E
6000|$|The simple {{charm of}} the {{beautiful}} orphan girl attracted all hearts. Her two little pupils became her slaves. [...] "Me loves oo," [...] the little Rasehellfrida would say, leaning her golden head in Gertrude's lap. Even the servants loved her. The head gardener would bring a bouquet of beautiful roses to her room before she was up, the second gardener a bunch of early cauliflowers, the third a spray of late asparagus, and even the tenth and eleventh a sprig of mangel-wurzel of an armful of hay. Her room was full of gardeners all the time, while at evening the aged butler, touched at the friendless girl's loneliness, would tap softly at her door to bring her a <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey</b> and seltzer or a box of Pittsburg Stogies. Even the dumb creatures seemed to admire her in their own dumb way. The dumb rooks settled on her shoulder and every dumb dog around the place followed her.|$|E
6000|$|First of all, for example, Henry Mullins {{came over}} quietly to Duff's rooms, over the Commercial Bank, {{with a bottle}} of <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey,</b> and they talked things over. And the night after that George Duff came over quietly to Mullins's rooms, over the Exchange Bank, {{with a bottle of}} Scotch whiskey. A few evenings after that Mullins and Duff went together, in a very unostentatious way, with perhaps a couple of bottles of rye, to Pete Glover's room over the {{hardware}} store. And then all three of them went up one night with Ed Moore, the photographer, to Judge Pepperleigh's house under pretence of having a game of poker. The very day after that, Mullins and Duff and Ed Moore, and Pete Glover and the judge got Will Harrison, the harness maker, to go out without any formality on the lake on the pretext of fishing. And the next night after that Duff and Mullins and Ed Moore and Pete Glover and Pepperleigh and Will Harrison got Alf Trelawney, the postmaster, to come over, just in a casual way, to the Mariposa House, after the night mail, and the next day Mullins and Duff and-- ...|$|E
60|$|Half {{past six}} in the morning, and all the crowd on the wharf and the boat due to leave in half an hour. Notice it!--in half an hour. Already she's whistled twice (at six, and at six fifteen), and at any minute now, Christie Johnson will step into the pilot house and pull the string for the warning whistle that the boat will leave in half an hour. So keep ready. Don't think of running back to Smith's Hotel for the {{sandwiches}}. Don't be fool enough {{to try to go}} up to the Greek Store, next to Netley's, and buy fruit. You'll be left behind for sure if you do. Never mind the sandwiches and the fruit! Anyway, here comes Mr. Smith himself with a huge basket of provender that would feed a factory. There must be sandwiches in that. I think I can hear them clinking. And behind Mr. Smith is the German waiter from the caff with another basket--indubitably lager beer; and behind him, the bar-tender of the hotel, carrying nothing, as far as one can see. But of course if you know Mariposa you will understand that why he looks so nonchalant and empty-handed is because he has two bottles of <b>rye</b> <b>whiskey</b> under his linen duster. You know, I think, the peculiar walk of a man with two bottles of whiskey in the inside pockets of a linen coat. In Mariposa, you see, to bring beer to an excursion is quite in keeping with public opinion. But, whiskey,--well, one has to be a little careful.|$|E
