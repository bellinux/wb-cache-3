5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in <b>raised</b> <b>voices.</b> When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} obedience, borzois are {{selective}} learners who quickly become bored with repetitive, apparently pointless, activity, {{and they can}} be very stubborn when they are not properly motivated. For example, food rewards, or [...] "baiting", may work well for some individuals, but not at all for others. Nevertheless, borzois are definitely capable of enjoying and performing well in competitive obedience and agility trials with the right kind of training. Like other sighthounds, they are very sensitive and do not cope well with harsh treatment or training based on punishment, and will be extremely unhappy if <b>raised</b> <b>voices</b> and threats are a part of their daily life. However, like any intelligent dog, borzois respond extremely well to the guidance, support, and clear communication of a benevolent human leadership.|$|E

6000|$|When I {{returned}} to the common the sun was setting. Scattered groups were hurrying {{from the direction of}} Woking, and one or two persons were returning. The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out black against the lemon yellow of the sky--a couple of hundred people, perhaps. There were <b>raised</b> <b>voices,</b> and some sort of struggle appeared to be going on about the pit. Strange imaginings passed through my mind. As I drew nearer I heard Stent's voice: ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Fentolin {{broke off}} {{in the middle of}} his sentence. The august calm of the great house had been {{suddenly}} broken. From up-stairs came the tumult of <b>raised</b> <b>voices,</b> the slamming of a door, the falling of something heavy upon the floor. Mr. Fentolin listened with a grim change in his expression. His smile had departed, his lower lip was thrust out, his eyebrows met. He raised the little whistle which hung from his chain. At that moment, however, the door was opened. Doctor Sarson appeared.|$|E

40|$|Background: Lombard’s effect {{increases}} {{the level of}} vocal intensity in the environment, in which noise occurs. This article {{presents the results of}} the author’s own study of vocal intensity level and A-weighted sound pressure level of background noise during normal lectures. The aim {{of the study was to}} define whether above-mentioned parameters depend on acoustic properties of rooms (classrooms or lecture rooms) and to define how many lectors speak with <b>raised</b> <b>voice.</b> Material and Methods: The study was performed in a group of 50 teachers and lecturers in 10 classrooms with cubature of 160 – 430 m 3 and reverberation time of 0. 37 – 1. 3 s (group A consisted of 3 rooms which fulfilled, group B consisted of 3 rooms which almost fulfilled and group C consisted of 4 rooms which did not fulfill criteria based on reverberation time (maximum permissible value is 0. 6 – 0. 8 s according to PN-B- 02151 - 4 : 2015). Criteria of <b>raising</b> <b>voice</b> were based on vocal intensity level (maximum value: 65 dB according to EN ISO 9921 : 2003). The values of above-mentioned parameters were determined from modes of A-weighted sound pressure level distributions during lectures. Results: Great differentiation of vocal intensity level between lectors was found. In classrooms of group A lectors were not using <b>raised</b> <b>voice,</b> in group B – 21 %, and in group C – 60 % of lectors were using <b>raised</b> <b>voice.</b> Conclusions: It was observed that acoustic properties of classrooms (defined by reverberation time) exert their effect on lecturer’s vocal intensity level (i. e., <b>raising</b> <b>voice),</b> which may contribute to the increased risk of vocal tract illnesses. The occurrence of Lombard’s effect in groups of teachers and lecturers, conducting lectures in rooms, was evidenced. Med Pr 2015; 66 (4) : 487 – 49...|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{watched him}} {{moving to the}} door. At {{the back of his}} mind there was a dull feeling that he could solve the whole trouble if only he could {{remember}} one fact which had escaped him. The effects of the blow he had received still handicapped him. He struggled to remember, but without result. Gentleman Jack reached the door and opened it: and as he did so a shrill yapping, hitherto inaudible because of the intervening oak and the <b>raised</b> <b>voices</b> within, made itself heard from the passage outside. Gentleman Jack closed the door with a hasty bang.|$|E
60|$|With {{elaborate}} carelessness, Mrs. Pett {{turned her}} head. At first {{she thought her}} companion must have alluded to one {{of a small group}} of young men who, very improperly in such surroundings, were discussing with <b>raised</b> <b>voices</b> the prospects of the clubs competing for the National League Baseball Pennant. Then, extending the sweep of her gaze, she saw that she had been mistaken. Midway between her and this group stood a single figure, the figure of a stout man in a swallow-tail suit, who bore before him a tray with cups on it. As she turned, this man caught her eye, gave a guilty start, and hurried across the room.|$|E
60|$|Dominey {{made his}} escape and went reeling down the corridor. At {{the top of}} the great quadrangular landing he stopped and stood with half-closed eyes for several moments. From downstairs he could hear the sound of pleasantly <b>raised</b> <b>voices,</b> the music of a piano in the distance, the click of billiard balls. He waited until he had regained his self-possession. Then, as he was on the point of descending, he saw Seaman {{mounting}} the stairs. At a gesture he waited for him, waited until he came, and, taking him by the arm, led him to a great settee in a dark corner. Seaman had lost his usual blitheness. The good-humoured smile played no longer about his lips.|$|E

When they were summoned, Sir William lay on the floor unconscious. Lady Ruth had fainted; Lumley and Wingrave were both bending over the former. On the floor were fragments of paper, which were afterwards put together, and found to be the remains of a check for a large amount, payable to Lady Ruth, and signed by Wingrave.|$|E

On arriving at the town hall he found the general seated at table. In front of him were a group of elderly men whom he supposed to be the leading citizens, and it was evident by the <b>raised</b> <b>voices</b> and angry looks, both of the old officer and of the citizens, that there was some serious difference of opinion between them.|$|E
60|$|I {{had felt}} myself {{an actor in}} a drama, and now I had very much the feeling an actor would have who answers to a cue and finds himself in mid-stage with the scenery {{and the rest of}} the cast {{suddenly}} vanished behind him. By that mixture of force and persuasion which avails itself of a woman's instinctive and cultivated dread of disputes and <b>raised</b> <b>voices</b> and the betrayal of contention to strangers, by the sheer tiring down of nerves and of sleepless body and by threats of an immediate divorce and a campaign of ruin against me, these three men had obliged Mary to leave Martens and go with them to Southampton, and thence they took her in Justin's yacht, the Water-Witch, to Waterford, and thence by train to a hired house, an adapted old castle at Mirk near Crogham in Mayo. There for all practical purposes she was a prisoner. They took away her purse, and she was four miles from a pillar-box and ten from a telegraph office. This house they had taken furnished without seeing it on the recommendation of a London agent, and in the name of Justin's solicitor. Thither presently went Lady Ladislaw, and an announcement appeared in the Times that Justin and Lady Mary had gone abroad for a time and that no letters would be forwarded.|$|E
