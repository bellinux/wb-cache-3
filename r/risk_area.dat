5|$|A strong {{jet stream}} moved {{northeast}} across the Great Plains region {{and a strong}} surface low in western Kansas strengthened as it moved to the Nebraska-South Dakota border. Ahead of the low, very warm and moist air spread throughout the South Central United States into Nebraska, eastern sections of South Dakota and the upper Mississippi Valley. The combination of strong winds and warm and moist air created conditions favorable for strong thunderstorms. On June 5, {{a high risk of}} severe weather was issued for six different states in the Midwestern United States, with a moderate <b>risk</b> <b>area</b> surrounding the high <b>risk</b> <b>area.</b> Forecasters had warned of a potentially historic outbreak, as computer forecasting models for June 5resembled those on June 8, 1974, when 39tornadoes struck the southern Great Plains and killed 22people. Wichita State University canceled evening classes because of the weather predictions. Severe weather began developing across eastern Colorado and northwestern Kansas during the morning and into the early afternoon, producing several weak tornadoes in the process. An EF1tornado impacted a campground near Kellogg, Iowa and injured two people. Despite extremely favorable conditions, severe weather for the day was limited and the tornadoes generally caused minimal damage.|$|E

40|$|Heavy human {{activities}} in mountainous areas make avalanches a big threat to tourists and natives {{at the same}} time. Therefore many tourist activities as well as businesses look for reliable risk assessment tools. According to complex mathematical models <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> are defined based on simulation and visualisation with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Resulting maps are used to support decisions of local officials. This study is aiming at two aspects of assessing avalanche risk areas: (1) impact of fuzzy set based classification on visualization of avalanche high <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> and (2) comparison of resulting GIS based risk maps using different logical operators. The main goals {{in this study are}} to explore and evaluate possibilities and impacts of fuzzy set modelling to linguistic terms representing spatial categories related to mapping avalanche <b>risk</b> <b>areas.</b> Quite recently local experts were quoted with “avalanche high <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> can be found at predominantly steep slopes with lots of shadow”. A numerical evaluation of the amount of high <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> was performed and was compared with the results of similar linguistic classes modelled by crisp sets. Clearly, a much more detailed account on high <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> can be obtained from the DEM, even if you use only two linguistic classes. The differences in the amount of high <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> were evaluated primarily with visual interpretation from a cartographic point of view. The study presents and discusses results obtained during a student’s workshop at the Department of Geography, Cartography and Geoinformation, University of Vienna. ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early-morning}} hours of Sunday March 29, forecasters at the Twin Cities NWS noticed {{that due to}} the model's {{prediction}} of strong wind shear and instability, the tornado risk was quite high for their region. Area forecast discussions during this period mentioned the possibility of F3-strength tornadoes later in the day. Also {{on the morning of}} March 29, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Day1 moderate risk of severe weather. This moderate <b>risk</b> <b>area</b> was more narrow than the previous day's outlook, encompassing only southwest Wisconsin, northern Iowa and the southern third of Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|On February 5 at 6:39am CST (1239 UTC), the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) {{issued a}} high risk of severe storms for most of Arkansas, the first in February since 1998. At 10:16 am CST (1616 UTC), the high <b>risk</b> <b>area</b> was {{extended}} farther northeast to include western Kentucky, northwestern Mississippi, the Missouri Bootheel, West Tennessee, and Southern Illinois. A moderate risk of severe weather was issued for northwestern Alabama, the rest of Arkansas, the rest of southern Illinois, southern Indiana, {{most of the rest of}} Kentucky, northern Louisiana, central Mississippi, parts of southeastern Missouri, southwestern Ohio, eastern Oklahoma, middle Tennessee and northeastern Texas. A total of fifteen watches were issued by the SPC during the outbreak, including thirteen tornado watches (two of which were PDS watches) and two severe thunderstorm watches.|$|E
5|$|The {{catalyst}} for the severe weather outbreak came as a positively-tilted shortwave trough progressed across the central High Plains into the Great Plains and eventually through the western Great Lakes region. A weaker disturbance pushed from the Ozarks into the Northeastern United States, acting to strengthen southwesterly winds aloft across the <b>risk</b> <b>area.</b> At the surface, a weak {{area of low pressure}} initially centered over northeastern Kansas early on April9 progressed steadily northeast while intensifying, reaching the trisection of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois by late that evening. A cold front stemming from the low progressed eastward across the Mid-South, whereas an arching warm front slowly pushed northward across eastern Iowa and northern Illinois. Modest surface heating ahead of the cold front allowed mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values to reach 1,000–1,500 J/kg, and a mass of rich moisture transported northward from the Gulf of Mexico pushed dewpoints into the lower 60s °F across the Enhanced <b>risk</b> <b>area.</b> Winds at 850 mb (4,781ft) strengthened at or above 45mph (75km/h) below winds of 70mph (110km/h) at 700 mb (9,882ft), creating a favorable setup for sustained supercells. Although the overall directional component of low-level winds was expected to be less than ideal as a whole, a small area of southeasterly surface winds developed near the surface low in northern Illinois.|$|E

There {{have been two}} major epizootics in the Horn of Africa in 1997 / 98 and 2006 / 07 that had the highest mortality to both humans and livestock. Our study, at Ijara District- Kenya, characterizes coping strategies used by communities in high and low <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> to make themselves less vulnerable to effects of adverse climate variability and in consequent RVF outbreaks. RVF outbreaks resolved to division level werecollated to bio-physical factors that {{were significantly associated with}} the outbreaks. Geostatistical analyses were used to identify RVF <b>risk</b> <b>areas.</b> At selected <b>risk</b> <b>areas,</b> focus group discussions (FGDs) involving the local communities, community health workers, and veterinary officers were used to characterize coping strategies that were employed in recent RVF outbreak. Solonetz, luvisols and vertisols and areas below 1000 m were significant. Low areas, fairly flat with a 0 – 15 % slope rise having these soil types have higher risk compared to the other areas. The low and high RVF <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> were approximately split halfway across district, northwards and southwards respectively. From the FGDs, actions taken by communities at high <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> were strategic while those at low <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> used reactive, ad hoc coping strategies.

5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate <b>risk</b> <b>area,</b> where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite {{advancement}} of our knowledge, cholera remains {{a public health}} concern. During March-April 2010, a large cholera outbreak afflicted {{the eastern part of}} Kolkata, India. The quantification of importance of socio-environmental factors in the risk of cholera, and the calculation of the risk is fundamental for deploying vaccination strategies. Here we investigate socio-environmental characteristics between high and low <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> as well as the potential impact of vaccination on the spatial occurrence of the disease. Methods and Findings: The study area comprised three wards of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. A mass cholera vaccination campaign was conducted in mid- 2006 as the part of a clinical trial. Cholera cases and data of the trial to identify high <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> for cholera were analyzed. We used a generalized additive model (GAM) to detect <b>risk</b> <b>areas,</b> and to evaluate the importance of socio-environmental characteristics between high and low <b>risk</b> <b>areas.</b> During the one-year pre-vaccination and two-year post-vaccination periods, 95 and 183 cholera cases were detected in 111, 882 and 121, 827 study participants, respectively.

25|$|Throughout its history, the Gowanus Canal's sewage {{problems}} have been exacerbated by the effects of stormwater. For years, heavy rains have flooded streets and caused sewage lines to overflow, contributing to the contamination of the Gowanus Canal. Much of the Gowanus canal area is at sea level, in a Zone A <b>risk</b> <b>area</b> for flooding, as residents discovered during Hurricane Sandy. To help prevent flooding, the city is investing in various methods of stormwater management. One related improvement has been the creation of specialized curbside gardens, or bioswales, along sidewalks to absorb stormwater and reduce sewer overflows into the Canal.

500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of February 5, a squall line {{developed}} across eastern Texas northward into Missouri and moved east towards the high <b>risk</b> <b>area.</b> Ahead of the squall line, the cap took longer than expected to break, but when it finally did in the late afternoon hours, numerous supercell thunderstorms quickly formed across Arkansas and southern Missouri. The first tornadoes touched down around 3:30 pm CST (2130 UTC). A cap is a layer of relatively warm air aloft (usually several thousand feet above the ground) which suppresses or delays the development of thunderstorms; the cap often prevents or delays thunderstorm development even in the presence of extreme instability. However, if the cap is removed or weakened, then explosive thunderstorm development can occur. Some of the most powerful tornado-producing supercells were situated across the Memphis and Jackson areas, as well as central Arkansas (one producing a tornado that tracked 122 miles (196km) and lasted about two hours) between 5:00 and 7:30 pm CST (2300 to 0130 UTC) while numerous other tornadoes were reported across northern Mississippi northwest of Tupelo, Mississippi, early in the evening. As the evening progressed, one of these supercells traveled across Middle Tennessee including the Nashville metropolitan area and south-central Kentucky, where several deadly tornadoes were reported during the evening hours between 7:30 pm and 11:00 pm CST (0130 to 0500 UTC) ...|$|E
