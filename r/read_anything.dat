In May 2008, ABC News reported that someone who spoke to them under condition of anonymity had hired a private investigator who located Genie in 2000. According to the investigator she was living a simple lifestyle in a small private facility for mentally underdeveloped adults and appeared to be happy, and she only spoke a few words but could still communicate fairly well in sign language. The news stories also reported that Genie's mother died of unspecified natural causes at the age of 87 and featured an interview with Genie's brother, who was living in Ohio, which was the only time he publicly spoke about his or Genie's lives; he told reporters that since leaving the Los Angeles area he had visited Genie and their mother only once, in 1982, and had refused to watch or <b>read</b> <b>anything</b> about Genie's life until just prior to the interview, but said he had recently heard Genie was doing well. A story by journalist Rory Carroll in The Guardian, published in July 2016, stated that Genie still lived in state care and that her brother died in 2011, and said that despite repeated efforts Susan Curtiss had been unable to renew contact with Genie.|$|E

In later years this kind of appreciation for what Manne could do was echoed by jazz notables like Louie Bellson, John Lewis, Ray Brown, Harry [...] "Sweets" [...] Edison, and numerous others who had worked with him at various times.

He then embarked on thirty months of professional practice in two local electricity companies, which was a requirement to enrol at Kristiania Technical School, a predecessor of the Faculty of Engineering at Oslo University College. When he enrolled in 1920 he chose technical chemistry instead of electronic engineering. He graduated in 1922, the best chemistry student; a fellow student recalled that he [...] "did not have to <b>read</b> <b>anything</b> more than once" [...] in order to remember it. In the spring of 1923, he also took the examen artium after attending the Haagaas School for one year.

In the meantime, he started on his compulsory military service.|$|E
500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the hell of it, I went for a walk for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had not seen him since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't <b>read</b> <b>anything</b> so fast since The Godfather.

500|$|Andy Kellman of AllMusic {{selected}} the song {{as one of}} the album's highlights, noting that it has [...] "a wide theatrical scope akin to that of The-Dream's own 'Nikki, Pt. 2/Abyss.'" [...] He further analysed: [...] "Over a swelling and receding production with echoes of Kim Carnes' 'Bette Davis Eyes,' Rihanna mourns ("Felt like love struck me in the night/I pray that love don't strike twice"), then confesses ("Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change"), then surrenders ("I'm prepared to die in the moment"). Perhaps no one should <b>read</b> <b>anything</b> into it." [...] Christina Lee of Idolator observed that the song [...] "casts out the album’s most heartbreaking line — 'I’m prepared to die at the moment' — but puts it in a context that doesn’t explain enough." [...] Esquires Miles Raymer thought that Police would have been a better band if they would have had Rihanna as their lead singer instead of Sting; however, he described [...] "Mother Mary" [...] as something to skip. Alike Raymer, Bernard Perusse for The Montreal Gazette felt that only [...] "Love Without Tragedy" [...] was worth listening to and described it as demonstrating [...] "a tiny bit of hope" [...] on the album. In a review of the album, Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork Media wrote that [...] "Rihanna sings a grim rhetorical: [...] "What's love without tragedy?" [...] However, according to her the real question that she and her songwriters is presenting on the record is [...] "Who is Rihanna without Chris Brown?" [...] "Nathan Slavick for DJ Booth was critical of the tracks theme, writing that [...] "Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary", along with [...] "Stay" [...] and [...] "No Love Allowed", all discuss the topic of Rihanna being a non-controversial person who is struggling to find love in a [...] "mad world".
