Wheels come in cylindrical, conical, and concave variations, while rails range in shape from a very flat 14 in. (3502 ̆ 009 mm) head radius to a tightly crowned 6 in. (1502 ̆ 009 mm) head radius.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{optimizing}} <b>rail</b> <b>profiles</b> to improve vehicle running stability in switch panel of high-speed railway turnouts is proposed in this paper.

The improved sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method is used to generate a sequence of improving profiles leading to the optimum one. The wheel-rail contact geometry and train-turnout dynamic interaction of the optimized profiles and those of nominal profiles are calculated for comparison. Without lateral displacement of wheel set, the maximum RRD in relation to a nominal profile will be kept within 0. 5 [*]mm– 1 [*]mm, while that in relation to an optimized profile will be kept within 0. 3 [*]mm– 0. 5 [*]mm. For the facing and trailing move of vehicle passing the switch panel in the through route, the lateral wheel-rail contact force is decreased by 34. 0 % and 29. 9 %, respectively, the lateral acceleration of car body is decreased by 41. 9 % and 40. 7 %, respectively, and the optimized profile will not greatly influence the vertical wheel-rail contact force.

40|$|Abstract. A {{system for}} {{measuring}} the <b>rail</b> <b>profiles</b> of a long hydrostatic guideway is proposed and applied to a precision roll lathe. The <b>rail</b> <b>profiles,</b> consisting of <b>rail</b> form errors and a parallelism error, are measured with four capacitive probes placed on the two rail surfaces, and a laser interferometer with angular optics. The form error of each rail is measured using a mixed sequential two-probe method, while the parallelism error between the rails is measured with two opposing capacitive probes. To eliminate the necessity for additional guidance mechanisms, the probe table is guided by air bearings and the rails being measured. To verify the measurement results, two self-verification techniques are suggested and tested. Firstly, the linear motion errors of the probe table on the two rails are compared, yielding a difference of 0. 79 µm in 2 σ. Secondly, {{the sum of the}} rail form errors is compared with the slope-removed sum of the two capacitive probes used for the parallelism measurement, yielding a difference of 0. 81 µm in 2 σ.

40|$|Wheel {{and rail}} wear is a {{significant}} issue in railway systems. Accurate prediction of this wear can improve economy, ride comfort, prevention of derailment and planning of maintenance interventions. Poor prediction can result in failure and consequent delay and increased costs {{if it is not}} controlled in an effective way. However, prediction of wheel and rail wear is still a great challenge for railway engineers and operators. The aim {{of this paper is to}} predict wheel wear and rail wear using an artificial neural network. Nonlinear Autoregressive models with exogenous input neural network (NARXNN) have been developed for wheel and rail wear prediction. Testing with a twin disc rig, together with measurement of wear using replica material and a profilometer have been carried out for wheel and rail wear under dry, wet and lubricated conditions and after sanding. Tests results from the twin disk rig have been used to train, validate, and test the neural network. Wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>profiles</b> plus load, speed, yaw angle, and first and second derivative of the wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>profiles</b> were used as an inputs to the neural network, while the output of neural network was the wheel wear and rail wear. Accuracy of wheel and rail wear prediction using the neural network was investigated and assessed in term of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results demonstrate that the neural network can be used efficiently to predict wheel and rail wear. The methods of collecting wear data using the replica material and the profilometer have also proved effective for wheel and rail wear measurements for training and validating the neural network. The laboratory tests have aimed to validate the wear predictions for realistic wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>profiles</b> and materials but they necessarily cover only a limited set of conditions.

50|$|The {{grinding}} {{quality index}} (GQI) is a software-based template {{used to measure}} the profile of a rail. This allows the desired <b>rail</b> <b>profile</b> to be compared to the actual <b>rail</b> <b>profile.</b> GQI software makes use of laser-based hardware mounted to the front and rear of the rail grinder. The use of laser-based hardware on maintenance of way vehicles such as rail grinders allow workers and contractors take precise measurements of the <b>rail</b> <b>profile</b> before and after grinding. The GQI is rated from 0 (low priority) to 100 (high priority). Grinding Quality Software is able to record and document measurements independently and provide a GQI rating for each rail on the track for before and after each pass on the grinder. The advantage of using GQI software is the ability to produce post-grinding reports for later usage by planners to help further prioritize and monitor grinding profiles in the future. GQI reports also provide analysis on the consistency of profiling to determine if grinding operations are consistently improving or deteriorating the <b>rail</b> <b>profile.</b> The usage of GQI software also provides the ability to produce accurate assessments of rail grinder effectiveness in real-time which allows for work to be prioritized more efficiently and be executed in a timely manner.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the possible causes of wheel squeal on Roslagsbanan, a narrow gauge (891 mm) suburban railway system in Stockholm, Sweden. Simulation of the dynamic behaviour of vehicles negotiating curves {{was carried out by}} means of the Swedish multibody simulation software GENSYS [1]. Wheel squeal may arise due to insufficient radial steering capability of the vehicles in curves causing too high levels of creep (relative sliding) in the wheel/rail-contact. Based on this theory, an advanced model of the creep-creep force relation was introduced. In this model the creep force decreases after creep reaches a certain level, called critical creep. It is believed that wheel squeal occurs after the creep level exceeded the critical creep value. Measured <b>rail</b> <b>profiles</b> of the curve together with measured wheel profiles were used as wheel/rail geometry input data. Other interesting parameters for the simulations, such as friction coefficient, primary suspension stiffness and damping, vehicle speed, braking/acceleration were varied and their effects on the outcome were tested. Worn wheels on newly grinded and worn rails under dry conditions are most likely to generate curve squeal. We believe the long term solution for Roslagsbanan is to grind the <b>rail</b> <b>profiles</b> into a shape more similar to the 50 E 3 with inclination 1 / 40. This will give a more even wheel wear over the whole wheel surface. However, curves below ca 300 m cannot be negotiated without wheel squeal, why all curves on the track tighter than ca 300 m have to be lubricated...|$|R
