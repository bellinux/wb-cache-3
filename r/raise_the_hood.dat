Embry had only been on the most wanted men list for twelve days, having been added on July 23, 1951.|$|R
50|$|The SW1001, in essence, placed <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> and {{powertrain}} of the SW1000 {{with the}} underframe and cab {{of the earlier}} SW1200. The EMD 645-series diesel engine had a deeper crankcase and oil pan than the SW1200's EMD 567-series engine. The engine had to be mounted on risers for sufficient clearance, <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>hood</b> about 6 in above the walkway compared to the SW1000, and requiring a spacer under <b>the</b> <b>hood.</b> <b>The</b> cab {{was similar to that}} of the SW1200, but not identical; it is longer, and has a different window arrangement. The SW1001 uses the same pilot plates as the SW1000; given the lower frame height, these protrude above the walkway deck height, giving the most obvious SW1001 spotting feature.|$|R
50|$|The first {{automobile}} limousine, {{built in}} 1902, was designed so the driver sat outside under a covered compartment. The word limousine {{is derived from}} the name of the French region Limousin, because this covered compartment physically resembled <b>the</b> <b>raised</b> <b>hood</b> of <b>the</b> cloak worn by the shepherds there. An alternate etymology has the chauffeur wearing a Limousin-style cloak in the open driver's compartment, for protection from the weather.|$|R
5000|$|The Delaware and Hudson Railway {{had eight}} RS3u {{locomotives}} {{which are often}} mistakenly called RS3ms.

40|$|A pop-up hood {{system has}} been {{developed}} to reduce the severity of head injuries to pedestrians in pedestrian-to-automobile accidents. The system employs sensors located on the bumper to detect impact with a pedestrian. If an impact occurs, a signal is sent to an actuator to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> rear portion of <b>the</b> engine <b>hood</b> approximately 100 mm. This provides a space between the engine and other hard components and <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> resulting in reduced pedestrian head injuries. Previous studies have mainly employed headform impactors to evaluate the head injury criteria (HIC) values for pop-up hoods. This report describes studies {{of the effect of}} <b>the</b> pop-up <b>hood</b> on injury parameters and kinematics using the POLAR pedestrian dummy. The effectiveness of <b>the</b> pop-up <b>hood</b> system was confirmed by the significant reduction of HIC values in impact tests using the POLAR dummy...|$|R

50|$|Before Koenigsberg"s solution, {{laboratory}} personnel routinely kept <b>the</b> fume <b>hood’s</b> {{access door}} wide open {{at all times}} whether they were actively working at it or not. So regardless of need, <b>the</b> <b>hood’s</b> exhaust system and related energy consumption were set up to support the full open position- 24 hours a day, seven days a week, {{regardless of whether the}} facility was occupied or not. Koenigsberg's new approach would require employees to be trained to modify their workplace activities and simply keep <b>the</b> fume <b>hood</b> door fully closed at all times, except when access to <b>the</b> <b>hood’s</b> interior work place was required. In addition, employees would now be instructed to limit <b>the</b> fume <b>hood</b> access door opening to the half open position when operating <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> and only <b>raise</b> it to <b>the</b> full open position when required.

25|$|The {{neckband}} of <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> {{usually has}} a loop of which original {{function is to}} hook onto the button of a cassock. Since many do not wear cassocks for graduation, the loop is sometimes hooked onto a shirt button instead. However, since <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> is rather heavy this {{has a tendency to}} pull the lightweight shirt upwards. The correct way to wear <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> is to allow the neckband to naturally hook itself onto the collar under the tie which secures <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> in place. Sometimes, <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> is worn too forward and down being hooked onto the jacket button or pinned which causes <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> to sit poorly and be more likely to slip down the shoulders like a shawl.|$|R

An interesting feature of <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> was {{what appeared to be a}} curse. After a certain period of time, each wearer of <b>the</b> black <b>hood</b> would die. After the death of <b>the</b> Black <b>Hood,</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> would find its way into the hands of another individual with the potential to become <b>the</b> next Black <b>Hood.</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} CFD {{simulations}} of a reinforced exhaust system (<b>the</b> Aaberg exhaust <b>hood</b> in particular). <b>The</b> reinforced suction effect {{is achieved by}} means of radial jet release. The radial jet deforms the flow pattern in front of <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> to a directional flow pattern. Unfortunately, {{the presence of an}} obstacle, such as a welding bench, leads to a defective operation of <b>the</b> <b>hood.</b> A number of CFD simulations has been undertaken in order to assess the effect of the obstacle size, its distance to <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> declination from <b>the</b> normal of the obstacle surface, on the flow pattern and consequently the capture efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>hood.</b> Capture efficiency of selected cases was evaluated. For the purpose of capture efficiency evaluation, a heat source was defined within the model that imitated a metal arc welding process and introduced similar heat input into the domain altogether with a release of a passive scalar. The scalar concentration was then evaluated at <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> opening, thus capture efficiency could be calculated. The results of simulations indicate that <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> operation depends on the spatial arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> and <b>the</b> obstacle. The best performance was achieved when <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> axis was aligned with the obstacle surface normal or the misalignment was small. Greater misalignment can be tolerated when the obstacle size is smaller than the hoodtoobstacle distance only...|$|R
