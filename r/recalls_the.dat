5|$|According to Burton Fisher, Puccini and Forzano {{borrowed}} {{heavily from}} the commedia dell'arte tradition in Gianni Schicchi. Schicchi himself <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> roguish Harlequin, while his daughter Lauretta, whose romance is nearly foiled by Buoso's relatives, resembles Columbina. Simone {{is drawn from}} Pantaloon, while the poverty-stricken Betto <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> buffoonish valet Zany. Doctor Spinelloccio <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> classic doctor from the commedia dell'arte, Balanzone even to his Bolognese origin. The Moor whose death momentarily scares the relatives, and his captain, are stock characters from commedia dell'arte.|$|E

5000|$|Frost's diction further {{highlights}} {{the parallels between}} Frost's discussion of desire and hate with Dante's outlook on sins of passion and reason with sensuous and physical verbs describing desire and loosely <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> characters Dante met in the upper rings of Hell: [...] "taste" [...] (<b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> Glutton), [...] "hold" [...] (<b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> adulterous lovers), and [...] "favor" [...] (<b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> hoarders). In contrast, hate is discussed with verbs of reason and thought ("I think I know.../To say...").|$|R

5|$|The final Halleluja is faster, {{giving up}} the fantasia format for a four-part fugue and in motet style, with all {{instruments}} doubling the voices. The style of the movement <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> 16th-century stile antico, although the style is still unmistakably Bach's.|$|E

5|$|Imperial Robe {{of purple}} velvet – the robe worn at the {{conclusion}} of the ceremony, on exit from the abbey. It comprises an embroidered ermine cape with a train of purple silk velvet, trimmed with Canadian ermine and fully lined with pure silk English satin.

5|$|Financial {{donations}} {{were also}} an issue. Bloomberg and Broad donated $350,000 and $250,000, respectively, {{to support the}} Senators. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee also spent $250,000 to oppose <b>recall.</b> <b>The</b> NRA spent over $108,000 to support <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> efforts. In total, the Morse and Giron side spent approximately $3,000,000 opposing <b>the</b> <b>recall,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> supporters spent about $500,000.|$|R
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Reagan himself, he <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> East German police not allowing people to get near the wall, which prevented the citizens from experiencing the speech at all. The fact that West German police acted {{in a similar way}} has however seldom been noted in accounts such as these.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the success of Bat Out of Hell, desperate for a follow-up, {{management}} and the record company put pressure on Steinman to stop touring in order to write a follow-up, provisionally titled Renegade Angel.

5|$|The Guilden Morden boar <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, where helmets with boar imagery are {{referenced}} five times. In {{three cases}} {{they appear to}} feature freestanding boars atop the helmets, like the Guilden Morden example. Such is the case when Grendel's mother seeks vengeance {{for the death of}} her son.|$|E

5|$|The {{music of}} the island of Sardinia {{is best known for}} the {{polyphonic}} chanting of the tenores. The sound of the tenores <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> roots of Gregorian chant, and is similar to but distinctive from the Ligurian trallalero. Typical instruments include the launeddas, a Sardinian triplepipe used in a sophisticated and complex manner. Efisio Melis was a well-known master launeddas player of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|According to the French Byzantinist Henri Grégoire, the Byzantine success {{against the}} Arabs that culminated with the Battle of Lalakaon {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} one of the oldest surviving acritic (heroic) poems: the Song of Armouris. Grégoire claimed that the eponymous protagonist, the young Byzantine warrior Armouris, was actually inspired by Emperor Michael III. A battle from the Byzantine heroic cycle around Digenis Akritas also strongly <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> events of Lalakaon, as the eponymous hero surrounds an Arab army near Malakopeia. Strong influences can be found in episodes in the Arab, and later Turkish, epic cycles around Battal Ghazi, as well as an episode in the One Thousand and One Nights.|$|E
5|$|Another {{composition}} {{from the}} song genre, also mentioned by Fisk and others, as intimately {{related to the}} last sonatas, and also depicting a feeling of wandering and homelessness, is the Winterreise (A Winter's Journey) song cycle. Numerous connections between different songs from the cycle and the sonatas, especially the C minor Sonata, have been mentioned. For example: in the C minor Sonata, the first movement's development section <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> songs Erstarrung and Der Lindenbaum; the second movement and the finale recall the songs Das Wirtshaus, Gefrorne Tranen, Gute Nacht, Auf dem Flusse, Der Wegweiser, and Einsamkeit. These allusions to Winterreise retain the alienated, lonely atmosphere of its songs.|$|E

5|$|David {{challenges}} Elijah with {{an incident}} {{from his childhood}} when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey did not like the violence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Detective Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs) is at therapy {{sessions}} with Dr. John Lee (BD Wong) and Dr. Judith Evans (Cherry Jones). Having fully recovered from his injuries, Michael <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> {{night that he}} and his family were involved in a serious car accident. He reveals that every time he goes to sleep, he is conflicted between two realities; In one reality, his wife Hannah Britten (Laura Allen) survived the accident, but his son Rex Britten (Dylan Minnette) is pronounced dead at the scene, while in the second reality, Hannah died in the accident instead of Rex.|$|E
5|$|Gregg Allman became {{interested}} in the Hammond after Mike Finnigan had introduced him to Jimmy Smith's music, and started to write material with it. His brother Duane specifically requested he play the instrument when forming the Allman Brothers Band, and he was presented with a brand new B-3 and Leslie 122RV upon joining. Allman <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> instrument was cumbersome to transport, particularly on flights of stairs, which often required the whole band's assistance. Author Frank Moriarty considers Allman's Hammond playing a vital ingredient of the band's sound.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to historical sources, Poe {{was influenced by}} other writers. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge was a general influence, and scenes of Pym and Dirk Peters in a cave echo scenes in Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, which many reviewers noted at the time, including London publications such as the Court Gazette and the Torch. The ship of corpses <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> legend of the Flying Dutchman, a ship which is cursed and unable to return home.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, the Welsh {{roots of}} the college {{come to the fore}} most {{prominently}} on Saint David's Day. The feast is marked by a choral Evensong in the chapel, decorated for the occasion with daffodils. The service, including music, is conducted entirely in Welsh (despite only a small minority of the choir usually being native speakers of the language). It is generally well attended by members of the Welsh community in Oxford. The college's annual St. David's Day Dinner traditionally culminates with the serving of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn's Pudding. The name <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> Welsh politician and prominent Jacobite who attended the college early in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Many, if {{not most}} Mauritians are unaware of the {{existence}} of such a graveyard in Mauritius.
