5|$|In 1860 {{he became}} organist at Magdalen College, Oxford, {{initially}} {{for a period}} of six months, at a salary of £120 per year. His duties included playing for services, training the choir and leading them on Fridays, a day on which the organ was not used. A new organ had been installed five years earlier that was ideal for developing his talent. He proved satisfactory in the post, and his contract was made permanent. He was permitted to study for a degree as long as it did not interfere with his duties, and he chose {{to do so in the}} expectation that it would <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> social status. He gained his BA in 1864 and his MA two years later and was keen to proceed to his Mus Doc, which would <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> standing within the university.|$|E
5|$|Through {{four seasons}} with the Colorado Eagles, Daavettila {{continued}} to perform amongst the ECHL's top offensive producers, recording 282 points in 260 regular season games. Despite placing second in league scoring with 80 points through the 2015–16 season, Daavettila opted to end his professional career and return to his hometown Howell, Michigan to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> family.|$|E
5|$|At {{around this}} time Etty began to receive many {{unsolicited}} letters from wealthy Old Etonian lawyer Thomas Myers. Myers was a huge admirer of Etty, and his letters mainly suggest literary topics he felt Etty ought to be painting so as {{to appeal to the}} nobility; he wrote regularly between July 1832 and May 1844. Although eccentric and largely incoherent (one of his suggestions was for Etty to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> profile by painting nude portraits of the wives of the aristocracy), Etty appears to have taken at least some of Myers's suggestions seriously.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} Miss Todd, and he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> eyes, and he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> hands, but the courage {{was not in}} him to speak. There was about Miss Todd as she stood, or as she sat, a {{firmness}} which showed itself even in her rotundity, a vigour in the very rubicundity of her cheek which was apt to quell the spirit {{of those who would}} fain have interfered with her. So Mr. O'Callaghan, having <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> eyes considerably, and having <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> hands a little, said nothing.|$|R
60|$|The next word failed on <b>his</b> lips; he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> hand in {{the dead}} silence. With eyes that opened wide in horror, he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> hand and pointed over Miss Garth's shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Watson <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> eyebrows, {{and somehow}} managed to drop the match he was <b>raising</b> to <b>his</b> cigar.|$|R
5|$|Cameron {{went on to}} star in many films, {{including}} 1987's Like Father Like Son (a body-switch comedy with Dudley Moore), {{which was}} a box office success. His next theatrical film, 1989's Listen to Me, performed poorly at the box office. When Growing Pains ended in 1992, Cameron went on to star in The WB sitcom Kirk which premiered in 1995 and ended two years later. In Kirk, Cameron played Kirk Hartman, a 24-year-old who has to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> siblings. Cameron and Noble also worked together on Kirk.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{was unable}} to extend its streak on the road against St. Louis, as they lost 59–69. Bill Clark led the team with 17points and Saunders grabbed four steals, enough to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> per-game average to 2.9, a nation-leading figure. With this, Saunders had at one point {{led the nation in}} double-doubles, rebounds, and steals. The Dukes lost again, 80–92, in their final road game against Saint Bonaventure. The loss put a damper on Duquesne's hopes for a home game {{in the first round of}} the Atlantic 10 tournament, as they fell into a tie for the ninth seed position.|$|E
5|$|Everyone offers their {{condolences to}} Ned, and Bart reluctantly plays a Christian video game with Rod and Todd. Homer accompanies Ned back {{home after the}} funeral and talks with him later that night when Ned is unable to sleep due to his {{loneliness}} and now having to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> sons alone. To help him get on with his life, Homer secretly makes a videotape of Ned to show to single girls across Springfield. Ned gets to date several women thanks to the tape, including Lindsey Naegle and Edna Krabappel, {{but none of them}} are successful.|$|E

5|$|In July 2012, Romney {{visited the}} United Kingdom, Israel, and Poland, meeting leaders {{in an effort}} to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> {{credibility}} as a world statesman. Comments Romney made about the readiness of the 2012 Summer Olympics were perceived as undiplomatic by the British press. Israeli Prime Minister (and former BCG colleague) Benjamin Netanyahu, embraced Romney, though some Palestinians criticized him for suggesting that Israel's culture led to their greater economic success.|$|E
5|$|Plante {{was one of}} {{the first}} goaltenders to skate behind the net to stop the puck. He also {{was one of the}} first to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> arm on an icing call to let his defencemen know what was happening. He perfected a stand-up, {{positional}} style, cutting down the angles; he became one of the first goaltenders to write a how-to book about the position. He was a pioneer of stickhandling the puck; before that time, goaltenders passively stood in the net and simply deflected pucks to defencemen or backchecking forwards.|$|E
5|$|Smith disbanded Ross's {{company in}} early September 1860. Within a week, Governor Sam Houston {{authorized}} Ross to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> own company of 60 mounted volunteers {{to protect the}} settlements near Belknap from Native American attacks. Ross and his men arrived at Fort Belknap on October 17, 1860 to find the local citizens they were sworn to protect had passed a resolution asking Ross to resign his commission and leave the frontier. The citizens erroneously believed the raiding was committed by Native Americans from the reservations, and they feared Ross's friendship with those on the reservations would make him ineffective.|$|E

5|$|The anarchy in Constantinople {{had ceased}} {{after the murder}} of the pretender Constantine Doukas, however, and a {{government}} had promptly been formed with Patriarch Nicholas at the helm. This urged Simeon to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> siege and enter peace negotiations, to the joy of the Byzantines. The protracted negotiations resulted in the payment of the arrears of Byzantine tribute, the promise that Constantine VII would marry one of Simeon's daughters, and, most importantly, Simeon's official recognition as Emperor of the Bulgarians by Patriarch Nicholas in the Blachernae Palace.|$|E
5|$|Deus Ex: Human Revolution is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game with incorporated first-person shooter and stealth mechanics. Players take {{the role of}} Adam Jensen, a man equipped with mechanical cybernetic implants called augmentations. The game's environments, ranging from open world hubs to more scripted environments, are explored in first-person, although actions such as hiding behind cover, conversing with non-playable characters (NPCs), and some attack animations switch to a third-person view. In these environments, players can find NPCs that will advance both the main story quest and optional side quests: completing quests, along with other actions such as combat with enemies, rewards Adam with experience points, which <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> experience level. Also accessible are black market vendors which supply equipment and weapons for Credits, the in-game currency. Interactive objects within environments can be highlighted, although these options are either turned off on the hardest difficulty or can be turned off in the options menu by the player.|$|E
5|$|Gary Lockwood, as Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell, had {{starred in}} the title role of Roddenberry's earlier series on NBC, The Lieutenant; Sally Kellerman was cast as Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. Both actors needed silver eyes, which were {{produced}} by an expert contact lens fabricator who sandwiched wrinkled tinfoil between two sclera contact lenses which covered the entire eye. These were outdated even in the 1960s and dangerous {{to the health of the}} actors' eyes. Although Kellerman could insert and remove the prosthetics easily with no discomfort, Lockwood found them almost impossible to use. He needed to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> face and sight along his nose in order to see through tiny holes in the foil. He was able to use this to enhance his performance as the mutating Mitchell, the unusual gaze giving him an arrogant and haughty demeanor.|$|E

The Baron <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> hand and shouted {{something}} in German. Instantly our assailants seemed to melt away. The Baron stepped on to the strip of lawn and <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|R
5|$|Increasingly, Edward {{began to}} rely on his sons for the {{leadership}} of military operations. The king's second son, Lionel of Antwerp, attempted to subdue by force the largely autonomous Anglo-Irish lords in Ireland. The venture failed, and the only lasting mark he left were the suppressive Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366. In France, meanwhile, the decade following the Treaty of Brétigny was one of relative tranquillity, but on 8 April 1364 JohnII died in captivity in England, after unsuccessfully trying to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> own ransom at home. He {{was followed by the}} vigorous CharlesV, who enlisted the help of the capable Constable Bertrand du Guesclin. In 1369, the French war started anew, and Edward's younger son John of Gaunt was given the responsibility of a military campaign. The effort failed, and with the Treaty of Bruges in 1375, the great English possessions in France were reduced to only the coastal towns of Calais, Bordeaux, and Bayonne.|$|E
5|$|John and Josephine deeply {{wish to have}} a {{child and}} when she is born with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony, they name her Snow White. However, Josephine, Snow White's mother, dies in childbirth, leaving John alone with their child. In the winter, John struggles to find food for his daughter, Snow White, when he sheds a tear over a frozen lake and frees a {{creature}} known as the Green-Eyed One. As thanks for freeing him, Green-Eyed One offers John three wishes. For John's wishes, he asks for nourishment for his daughter, a kingdom to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> family, and a queen for a new wife, as the creature cannot raise the dead.|$|E
5|$|Mike and Sulley are {{led away}} by the CDA, and are {{expelled}} from the university {{as a result of}} their actions, but the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program the next semester, as Hardscrabble was impressed by their performances in the scare games. As Mike leaves on the bus, Sulley runs after him to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> spirits. Hardscrabble then appears and wishes the two luck, claiming they were the first students to have surprised her. The two take jobs in the mail room of Monsters, Inc., eventually working their way up to join the Scarer Team and setting the events of Monsters, Inc. in motion.|$|E

5|$|Moving {{north to}} Auckland, Heaphy's {{new role as}} the chief {{draughtsman}} for the Auckland Survey Office, kept him occupied with the preparation of maps and plans. After a few years, he began to spend a greater {{amount of time in}} the field, where he carried out survey work. As he had done when living in Nelson, he supplemented his income with commissioned artworks. He began to build on his geological knowledge, taking a particular interest in vulcanology and wrote an article on Auckland's volcanoes for a geological journal in England. He completed several paintings of volcanoes as well as thermal attractions in the Bay of Plenty including the famous Pink and White Terraces. Hoping to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> profile, he sent many of his works to London and some remain on display at the offices of the Geological Society.|$|E
5|$|One of the outlaws, a {{black man}} named James Middleton, leaves {{the safety of the}} group to be with his wife, Pauline. James is {{subsequently}} killed by Loco when he takes Pauline hostage. Vengeful, Pauline writes to Silence, requesting him to kill Loco. Meanwhile, the newly-elected Governor, hoping to have order maintained before declaring an amnesty regarding the outlaws, assigns the righteous but bumbling soldier Gideon Burnett as the sheriff of Snow Hill. On his way, Burnett encounters the outlaws, who steal his horse for food. After getting lost in the snow, he finds a stagecoach travelling to Snow Hill, on which he meets Silence, and later, Loco. Upon arrival, Silence meets Pauline, who promises to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> reward.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
