However, HR professionals and academics have been slow to contribute to these key strategic drivers of business success. In this article we draw on our research,, from often disparate bodies of literature from practical and consulting experience to develop a model of the links between strategic HR, corporate <b>reputations</b> <b>and</b> brands. The model suggests converging lines of enquiry and interest for academics in HR, marketing, communications and strategy, but also highlights some strategic dilemmas for organizations in balancing best practice and best fit HRM. ...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThis study {{examined}} the unique contributions of social acceptance and popularity in predicting perceived social <b>reputations</b> <b>and</b> perceived dyadic relationships in a cross-sectional sample of 418 sixth and seventh grade students (approximate average age of 12 years). We assessed early adolescents’ social status using peer nominations and measured {{their perceptions of their}} social status, their behavioral <b>reputations,</b> <b>and</b> their friendships from a combination of self-ratings and peer nominations. Social acceptance was a positive predictor of perceptions of social acceptance and friendships and a negative predictor of perceptions of rejection and victimization. Popularity was a positive predictor of perceptions of popularity, rejection, and aggression and a negative predictor of perceptions of unpopularity and withdrawal. The results were consistent with the suggestion that social acceptance is related to perceiving facets of <b>reputations</b> <b>and</b> relationships relevant to forming and maintaining friendships, whereas popularity is related to perceiving facets pertinent to gaining social power...|$|R

Therefore, this paper presents a systematic review of various trust <b>and</b> <b>reputation</b> systems <b>and</b> proposes a typology to classify them from three aspects, centralized vs. decentralized, persons/agents vs. resources, global vs. personalized. These aspects are important not only in that they clarify the difference between various existing trust <b>and</b> <b>reputation</b> systems, but also in that they point out the potential research directions for using trust <b>and</b> <b>reputation</b> in web services and provide some reference systems for them...|$|R

By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found.|$|E

Close attention is paid to the role of reputations in providing the incentives for firms to deliver high-quality goods. We model three different scenarios - monopoly, duopoly with firm-specific <b>reputations,</b> <b>and</b> duopoly with industry-wide <b>reputations</b> - <b>and</b> compare the resulting welfare of processors and their customers.
