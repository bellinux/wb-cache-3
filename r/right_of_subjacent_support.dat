The neighbor will also be strictly liable for damage to buildings on the landowner's property if the landowner can show that the weight of the buildings did not contribute to the collapse of the land. If the landowner is unable to make such a showing, the neighbor must be shown to have been negligent in order for the landowner to recover damages.|$|R

40|$|Transmissible ileal {{hyperplasia}} (TIH) was experimentally induced in weanling hamsters, and {{the development}} of lesions was characterized. Ileal lesions developed in two phases: a hyperplastic phase which was detected by Day 10 and an inflammatory phase which began by Day 20. Hyperplasia began as focal lengthening of villi with expansion of crypt-type epithelium onto villus walls. Diffuse hyperplasia of distal ileum developed; dilated, tortuous crypts penetrated <b>subjacent</b> <b>supporting</b> tissues; but metastases were not seen. Inflammation began in association with focal or segmental necrosis of crypt epithelium, and crypt abscesses developed. Severe pyogranulomatous inflammation of the ileal wall, focal peritonitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis, and portal hepatitis were common in advanced lesions. Development of ileal lesions was closely correlated with accumulation of particulate antigen, detectable by immunofluorescence, in the cytoplasm of mucosal epithelial cells. Antigen was also detected in ileal granulomas, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver. There was simultaneous development of serum antibody specific for intracytoplasmic antigen. These studies comfirm that mucosal hyperplasia is the primary lesion in TIH...|$|R
40|$|Parallel Panel Session 4 B: Law of the SeaChina {{has kept}} open {{the option to}} declare an Air Defense Identification Zone in the South China Sea (SCS) which may cover the disputed area of the Spratly Islands. Other {{maritime}} powers like the United States and the United Kingdom have insisted on exercising their customary international law <b>right</b> <b>of</b> navigation as well as overflight in the relevant areas of the SCS. While existing literature has dealt with these high seas rights {{in relation to the}} Spratly Islands and the SCS, no attempt has been made to look at the international law status of the airspace superjacent the Spratly Islands. This paper takes the view that an indeterminate territory, not being res nullius nor res communis, generates its own territorial airspace. Although this superjacent territorial airspace is likewise considered as indeterminate being an inseparable part <b>of</b> the <b>subjacent</b> indeterminate territory, it ceases {{to be part of the}} international airspace. Consequently, claimant-states can subject it to the operation of domestic law jurisdiction. As applied to the Spratly Islands in the SCS, the paper argues that the Spratly Islands has the status of an indeterminate territory. Notwithstanding its indeterminacy, it has its own territorial airspace. While this territorial airspace is also indeterminate as it is inextricable from the status <b>of</b> <b>subjacent</b> indeterminate land and sea territory, it no longer forms part of the international airspace. Claimant-states like China, Vietnam, and the Philippines can subject the airspace of the Spratly Islands or a portion or portions thereof to the jurisdiction of their municipal laws...|$|R

40|$|Three {{cases of}} infiltrating {{congenital}} lipomatosis {{of the face}} are presented.

Although these tumors are benign, all three recurred after surgical excision. Extensive specimen sampling is advisable to exclude infiltrating lipoma, diffuse angiomatosis, infiltrating angiolipoma, and well-differentiated liposarcoma.

40|$|A formal {{device is}} said to be {{adaptive}} whenever its behavior changes dynamically, in a direct response to its input stimuli, without interference of external agents, even its users. In order to achieve this feature, adaptive devices have to be self-modifiable. In other words, any possible changes in the device’s behavior must be known at their full extent at any step of its operation in which the changes have to take place. Therefore, adaptive devices must be able to detect all situations causing possible modifications and to adequately react by imposing corresponding changes to the device’s behavior. In this work, devices are considered whose behavior is based on the operation <b>of</b> <b>subjacent</b> non-adaptive devices that be fully described by some finite set of rules. An adaptive rule-driven device may be obtained by attaching adaptive actions to the rules <b>of</b> the <b>subjacent</b> formulation, so that whenever a rule is applied, the associated adaptive action is activated, causing the set of rules <b>of</b> the <b>subjacent</b> non-adaptive device to be correspondingly changed. In this paper a new general formulation is proposed that unifies the representation and manipulation of adaptive rule-driven devices and states a common framework for representing and manipulating them. The main feature of this formulation is that it fully preserves the nature of the underlying non-adaptive formalism, so that the adaptive resulting device be easily understood by people familiar to the subjacent device. For illustration purposes, a two-fold case-study is presented, describing adaptive decision tables as adaptive rule-driven devices, and using them for emulating the behavior of a very simple adaptive automaton, which is in turn another adaptive rule-driven device...|$|R
40|$|Morphological and {{functional}} changes in endothelial and interstitial cells are considered central to myxomatous degeneration of the canine mitral valve (endocardiosis). The {{aim of this}} study was to describe and quantify changes in valve endothelial cells (VECs), interstitial cells (VICs) and the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) of the sub-endothelial zone of diseased valves using a combination of transmission electron microscopy, stereology and computer-aided image analysis. Marked degradation of the endothelium was evident in diseased valves, which coincided with significant degradation of the local ECM (P &# 60;  0. 001). There were decreases and increases in the numbers of VECs and VICs, respectively, in diseased valves, with particular accumulation <b>of</b> VICs <b>subjacent</b> to the valve surface (P &# 60;  0. 01). Overall, VICs were more pleomorphic than VECs in both normal and diseased valves, but for VECs, the degree of pleomorphism was significantly different in diseased valves (P &# 60;  0. 0001). The findings of the study confirm that canine myxomatous mitral valve disease is associated with marked endothelial damage, with attendant proliferation <b>of</b> <b>subjacent</b> activated myofibroblasts. The fact that similar endothelial changes are present in normal valves suggests these processes not only contribute to valve pathology, but may also represent life-long valve remodelling. </p...|$|R
