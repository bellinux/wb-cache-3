50|$|Sewell {{received}} {{strong support}} from younger voters, tenants, and the highly educated and affluent. He carried midtown (ward 5), the downtown (wards 6 and 7, the latter of which he <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alderman), the east end (wards 8 and 9) {{and one of the}} city's wealthy northern wards (ward 10). O'Donohue won the working class, heavily Catholic and ethnic west end (wards 1-4), one of which he <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alderman; Sewell fared poorly in the west end. Smith narrowly beat Sewell in the northern ward 11, which he had <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alderman.|$|R

5|$|Bézout's {{identity}} {{can be used}} {{to solve}} Diophantine equations. For instance, one of the standard proofs of Lagrange's four-square theorem, that every positive integer can be <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sum of four squares, is based on quaternion GCDs in this way.|$|E
5|$|For {{the general}} {{case of a}} line {{terminated}} in some arbitrary impedance it is usual to describe the signal as a wave traveling down the line and analyse it in the frequency domain.

5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} statistic. There are also usable items such as potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E
5|$|Employees from Marvel Comics {{worked closely}} with Capcom's art design team to ensure that each {{character}} from their company was properly <b>represented.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, several Marvel characters were modeled after their more recent comic book appearances. For example, Iron Man sports his Extremis Armor, while Wolverine wears his costume from Astonishing X-Men. The development team originally planned to have English and Japanese voice actors for all characters. Niitsuma eventually decided against it, stating that having the Marvel roster speaking Japanese did not mesh well with the characters' image.|$|E

5|$|In {{physical}} terms the function is <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> superposition of sine waves and the coefficients give {{information about the}} function's frequency spectrum. A complex-number form of Fourier series is also commonly used. The concrete formulae above are consequences of a more general mathematical duality called Pontryagin duality. Applied to the group R, it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are reciprocal lattices, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real vector space endowed with the additional datum of a lattice encoding positions of atoms in crystals.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Century Saint Conrad of Constance is {{sometimes}} <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bishop holding a chalice with a spider. According to this story, {{while he was}} celebrating Easter Mass, a spider fell into the chalice. Ignoring the commonly-held belief {{of the time that}} all or most spiders were poisonous; as a token of faith, Conrad nevertheless drank the wine with the spider in it.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish National Party (SNP) has {{campaigned for}} a place in Eurovision for Scotland but had been {{rejected}} numerous times because Scotland is <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> part of the British entry and {{is represented by the}} BBC. On 11 February 2008 the EBU stated that a Scottish broadcaster could apply for EBU membership, but under the current rules could not enter the Eurovision Song Contest as the BBC currently has exclusive rights to represent the entire United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The Shiva half has a flat {{masculine}} chest, {{a straight}} vertical chest, broader shoulder, wider waist and muscular thigh. He wears a yagnopavita (sacred thread) across the chest, which is sometimes <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> naga-yagnopavita (a snake worn as a yagnopavita) or {{a string of}} pearls or gems. The yajnopavita may also divide the torso into its male and female halves. He wears ornaments characteristic of Shiva's iconography, including serpent ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Wang tiles are squares {{coloured}} on each edge, {{and placed}} so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles {{have the same}} colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang dominoes. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any Turing machine can be <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> set of Wang dominoes that tile the plane {{if and only if}} the Turing machine does not halt. Since the halting problem is undecidable, the problem of deciding whether a Wang domino set can tile the plane is also undecidable.|$|E
5|$|According to Najmabadi, {{occasionally}} we {{come across}} the lion and sun with a sword in the lion's paw and with a crown during this period. The Mohammad Shah's decree in 1836 states that the lion must erectly stand, bear a saber ("to make it explicitly stands for the military prowess of the state"). The crown was also added {{as a symbol of}} royalty rather than for any particular Qajar monarch. The decree states that the emblem is at once the national, royal, and the state emblem of Iran. In this period the lion was depicted as more masculine and the sun was female. Before this time the sun could be male or female and the lion was <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> swordless, friendly and subdued seated animal.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{disadvantage of}} the mobility analogy {{is that it}} does not maintain the analogy between electrical and mechanical impedance. Mechanical impedance is <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> electrical admittance and a mechanical resistance is <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> electrical conductance in the electrical equivalent circuit. Force is not analogous to voltage (generator voltages are often called electromotive force), but rather, it is analogous to current.|$|R

5|$|After Boisselier {{announced}} that {{no evidence of}} the cloning would be provided, journalists became very skeptical of her story. While discussing Boisselier's management of Clonaid, Palmer notes {{that it is impossible}} to know why she stated that a clone was produced but then refused to provide evidence. She argues that her refusal to provide evidence may have been because she organized a hoax, did not wish to publicize the birth of an unhealthy child, or was taken advantage of by a scientist she had hired. American science journalist Steven S. Hall criticized the media for their coverage of Clonaid, believe that they were inarticulately <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> credible group. He speculates that the coverage of Boisselier and other cloning adherents galvanized sentiment against cloning, leading to its banning in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> circle, to a goal point, <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E
5|$|Although far rarer {{than their}} prank cousins, {{exploding}} cigars {{used as a}} means to kill or attempt to kill targets in real life has been claimed, and is well <b>represented</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fictional plot device. The most famous case concerning the intentionally deadly variety was an alleged plot by the CIA of the US in the 1960s to assassinate Fidel Castro. Notable real-life incidents involving the non-lethal ilk include an exploding cigar purportedly given by Ulysses S. Grant to an acquaintance and a dust-up between Turkish military officers and Ernest Hemingway after he pranked one of them with an exploding cigar.|$|E
