40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) pregenomic RNA {{contains}} a hairpin structure (ϵ) {{located in the}} preCore region, essential for viral replication. ϵ stability is enhanced {{by the presence of}} preCore variants and ϵ is recognized by the HBV polymerase (Pol). Mutations in the <b>retrotranscriptase</b> domain (YMDD) of Pol are associated with treatment resistance. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the preCore region and YMDD motif by ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS). To evaluate the UDPS error rate, an internal control sequence was inserted in the amplicon. A newly developed technique enabled simultaneous analysis of the preCore region and Pol in the same viral genome, as well as the conserved sequence of the internal control. Nucleotide errors in HindIII yielded a UDPS error rate < 0. 05 %. UDPS study confirmed the possibility of simultaneous detection of preCore and YMDD mutations, and demonstrated the complexity of the HBV quasispecies and cooperation between viruses. Thermodynamic stability of the ϵ signal was found to be the main constraint for selecting main preCore mutations. Analysis of ϵ-signal variability suggested the essential nature of the ϵ structural motif and that certain nucleotides may be involved in ϵ signal functions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe present work {{characterizes the}} mRNA {{expression}} of PACAP type I receptors in rat peritoneal macrophages {{but not in}} peritoneal lymphocytes by both <b>retrotranscriptase</b> and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and homologous Southern hybridization and the stimulation by PACAP 27, PACAP 38 and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) of sn- 1, 2 -diacylglycerol production in rat peritoneal macrophage membranes. The binding of [125 I]PACAP 27 was time and cell concentration dependent. Scatchard analysis of displacement of the bound tracer by unlabeled PACAP 27 indicates the existence of two classes of binding sites. The dissociation constant (Kd) was 0. 64 ± 0. 08 nM and the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) was 8. 85 ± 1. 45 fmol/ 106 cells for the high affinity binding site. The low affinity binding site had a Kd of 0. 10 ± 0. 06 μM with a Bmax of 300 ± 21. 9 fmol/ 106 cells. Scatchard analysis of VIP displacement data indicated the presence of two classes of binding sites with a Kd and Bmax different to those of PACAP 27. These results suggest that PACAP binds to two binding sites, PACAP type I receptors and PACAP type II receptors. The PACAP 27 -stimulated diacylglycerol production was not affected by treatment with pertussis toxin. However, the presence of GTP partially inhibited this PACAP 27 stimulation of 1, 2 -diacylglycerol in a dose dependent manner, although GTP alone stimulates diacylglycerol accumulation. In conclusion, {{for the first time}} we demonstrate by biochemical and molecular biology criteria the existence of PACAP type I receptors on rat peritoneal macrophages and the evidence for coupling with a pertussis toxin-insensitive G regulatory protein...|$|E

We report the virologic and clinical follow-up of the Madrid cohort of perinatally HIV-infected children and adolescents after the selection of triple-class drug-resistant mutations (TC-DRM). We identified patients from the cohort carrying HIV- 1 variants with TC-DRM to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors according to IAS-USA- 2013. We recovered pol sequences or resistance profiles from 2000 to 2011 and clinical–immunologic–virologic data {{from the moment of}} TC-DRM detection until December 2013. Viruses harbouring TC-DRM were observed in 48 (9 %) of the 534 children and adolescents from 2000 to 2011, rising to 24. 4 % among those 197 with resistance data. Among them, 95. 8 % were diagnosed before 2003, 91. 7 % were Spaniards, 89. 6 % carried HIV- 1 -subtype B and 75 % received mono/dual therapy as first regimen. The most common TC-DRM present in ≥ 50 % of them were D 67 NME, T 215 FVY, M 41 L and K 103 N (<b>retrotranscriptase)</b> and L 90 M (protease). The susceptibility to darunavir, tipranavir, etravirine and rilpivirine was 67. 7 %, 43. 7 %, 33. 3 % and 33. 3 %, respectively, and all reported high resistance to didanosine, abacavir and nelfinavir. Despite the presence of HIV- 1 resistance mutations to the three main antiretroviral families in our paediatric cohort, some drugs maintained their susceptibility, mainly the new protease inhibitors (tipranavir and darunavir) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (etravirine and rilpivirine). These data will help to improve the clinical management of HIV-infected children with triple resistance in Spain...|$|E
40|$|Small self-cleaving RNAs, {{such as the}} {{paradigmatic}} Hammerhead ribozyme (HHR), {{have been}} recently found widespread in DNA genomes across all kingdoms of life. In this work, we found that new HHR variants are preserved in the ancient family of Penelope-like elements (PLEs), a group of eukaryotic retrotransposons regarded as exceptional for encoding telomerase-like <b>retrotranscriptases</b> and spliceosomal introns. Our bioinformatic analysis revealed not only the presence of minimalist HHRs in the two flanking repeats of PLEs but also their massive and widespread occurrence in metazoan genomes. The architecture of these ribozymes indicates that they may work as dimers, although their low self-cleavage activity in vitro suggests the requirement of other factors in vivo. In plants, however, PLEs show canonical HHRs, whereas fungi and protist PLEs encode ribozyme variants with a stable active conformation as monomers. Overall, our data confirm the connection of self-cleaving RNAs with eukaryotic retroelements and unveil these motifs as a significant fraction of the encoded information in eukaryotic genomes. Key words: intron, LTR, retrotransposon, RNA self-cleavage, SINE, telomerase. The knowledge of the manifold roles of RNA has transformed our perception of this macromolecule {{from that of a}} mere intermediary into a key component of present and past life o...|$|R
40|$|Concerned {{about the}} risks of {{mammography}} screening in the adult population, we analyzed the ability of human mammary epithelial cells to cope with mammogram-induced DNA damage. Our study shows that an X-ray dose of 20 mGy, which is the standard dose received by the breast surface per two-view mammogram X-ray exploration, induces increased frequencies of DNA double-strand breaks to in vitro aged-but not to young-human mammary epithelial cells. We provide evidence that aged epithelial breast cells are more radiosensitive than younger ones. Our studies point to an inefficient damage response of aged cells to low-dose radiation, this being due to both delayed and incomplete mobilization of repair proteins to DNA strand breaks. This inefficient damage response is translated into an important delay in double-strand break disappearance and consequent accumulation of unrepaired DNA breaks. The result of this is a significant increase in micronuclei frequency in the in vitro aged mammary epithelial cells exposed to doses equivalent to a single mammogram X-ray exploration. Since our experiments were carried out in primary epithelial cell cultures in which cells age {{at the same time as}} they undergo replication-dependent telomere shortening, we needed to determine the contribution of these two factors to their phenotype. In this paper, we report that the exogenous expression of human telomerase <b>retrotranscriptase</b> in late population doubling epithelial cells does not rescue its delayed repair phenotype. Therefore, retarded DNA break repair is a direct consequence of cellular aging itself, rather than a consequence of the presence of dysfunctional telomeres. Our findings of long-lasting double strand breaks and incomplete DNA break repair in the in vitro aged epithelial cells are in line with the increased carcinogenic risks of radiation exposures at older ages revealed by epidemiologic studies...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} study {{describing}} drug resistance mutations (DRM) and HIV- 1 variants among infected pregnant women in Equatorial Guinea (GQ), a country with high (6. 2 %) and increasing HIV prevalence. Dried blood spots (DBS) were collected from November 2012 to December 2013 from 69 HIV- 1 infected women participating in a prevention of mother-to-child transmission program in the Hospital Regional of Bata and Primary Health Care Centre María Rafols, Bata, GQ. The transmitted (TDR) or acquired (ADR) antiretroviral drug resistance mutations at partial pol sequence among naive or antiretroviral therapy (ART) -exposed women were defined following WHO or IAS USA 2015 lists, respectively. HIV- 1 variants were identified by phylogenetic analyses. A total of 38 of 69 HIV- 1 specimens were successfully amplified and sequenced. Thirty (79 %) belonged to ART-experienced women: 15 exposed to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) monotherapy, and 15 to combined ART (cART) as first regimen including two NRTI and one non-NRTI (NNRTI) or one protease inhibitor (PI). The TDR rate was only found for PI (3. 4 %). The ADR rate was 37. 5 % for NNRTI, 8. 7 % for NRTI and absent for PI or NRTI+NNRTI. HIV- 1 group M non-B variants caused most (97. 4 %) infections, mainly (78. 9 %) recombinants: CRF 02 _AG (55. 2 %), CRF 22 _A 101 (10. 5 %), subtype C (10. 5 %), unique recombinants (5. 3 %), and A 3, D, F 2, G, CRF 06 _cpx and CRF 11 _cpx (2. 6 % each). The high rate of ADR to <b>retrotranscriptase</b> inhibitors (mainly to NNRTIs) observed among pretreated pregnant women reinforces the importance of systematic DRM monitoring in GQ to reduce HIV- 1 resistance transmission and to optimize first and second-line ART regimens when DRM are present...|$|E
40|$|Tesis Doctoral inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular. Fecha de lectura: 13 - 01 - 2017 Dried blood {{specimens}} (DBS) {{represent an}} alternative sample type to liquid plasma for performing HIV- 1 diagnostic techniques and monitoring antiretroviral therapy (ART) efficacy {{as they are}} easy to prepare, less biohazardous, do not require a cold chain, and can be shipped by standard mail at room temperature to a reference laboratory if required. In this Thesis, different studies focusing on the use of DBS as sample type to diagnose HIV- 1 infection in infants, to quantify the HIV- 1 viral load (VL), and to identify drug resistance mutations and HIV- 1 variants are presented. A molecular epidemiological approach was used to analyze the results based on the different HIV- 1 subtypes and recombinants included in the studies. Our results confirm that DBS can be used for HIV- 1 VL quantification and for the detection of drug resistant mutations (DRM) in viruses, which can be useful for early therapeutic failure detection in treated subjects. However, VL in DBS can be overestimated in specimens with low VL in plasma, maybe due to a higher effect of proviral DNA in quantification. Considering that different VL assays provide different VL values for the same specimen, the use of the same VL technique for each patient during ART monitoring is recommended. Commercial VL assays using DBS were useful for early infant diagnosis, although discrepant results among the four assays analyzed in this Thesis were common. Further research is required to reduce false positive results that could result in wrong diagnosis and unneeded treatment. VL assays should also increase their sensitivity and specificity to avoid overestimated HIV- 1 quantifications, which could be interpreted as virological failure events, or false negative diagnostic results due to genetic variability. As to the identification of DRM using DBS, the high rate of acquired drug resistance to <b>retrotranscriptase</b> inhibitors observed among pretreated pregnant women reinforces the importance of systematic DRM monitoring in countries as Equatorial Guinea to reduce HIV- 1 resistance transmission and to optimize first and second-line ART regimens when DRM are present. In summary, DBS collection is especially useful in settings with limited infrastructures or when low blood volume is available, as in infants. HIV- 1 VL testing is useful for monitoring the efficacy of ART, detecting early therapeutic failure events, and performing an early infant diagnosis of the HIV infection. More studies including more HIV- 1 variants are needed to define the performance of commercial virological assays when using DBS...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis viruses {{are among}} the most {{infectious}} pathogen for human causing severe liver disease like acute or chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can chronically infect the host liver replicating persistently in the hepatocyte. To date more than five hundred million of people worldwide are living with HBV or HCV chronic infection with high risk of developing liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-viral therapy is necessary to avoid or slow down the liver disease and it includes different agents like the interferons family, acting as immune modulators, or the direct acting anti-viral (DAAs), small molecules able to interfere with viral enzymes at different stages of the replication path. Unfortunately therapy may fail in some patient because of viral and/or host factors. When an end-stage liver disease is reached, the organ transplantation is the only therapy available (life-saving). Viral heterogeneity affect the anti-viral therapy outcome since particular type of viral variants are frequently found associated to therapy failure, both in HBV and HCV infection cases. Since no new drugs for HBV infection treatment have been developed and approved from 4 years, all the primary HBV resistant associated variants (RVs) have been already identified today, locating in the HBV polymerase / <b>retrotranscriptase</b> gene and mainly at codons rtA 181 and rtM 204. Some other codons have been identified in resistant HBV strains but always associated to the primary ones and classified as secondary / compensatory mutations for their role in restoring the wild-type replication level. Despite these information the HBV RVs biological role is still not clear and the in-vitro systems are far away from a real in vivo condition mimicking, with a concrete risk to provide misleading information. New high sensitive technologies like Real-Time PCR and Ultra Deep Pyrosequencing could detect RVs as minor viral population in naïve patient but they were not set up to work in low levels of total viraemia condition (< 10 E+ 04 UI/ml), a possible on-treatment situation, particularly found in no responding or immunocompromised patients. Differently from HBV, the first HCV resistant associated variants have been identified few time ago and others are probably still to come because of the many anti-HCV drugs in development or ready to be approved for the HCV infection treatment. Hence, in this thesis we wanted to develop biomolecular and bioinformatic methods to identify the anti-viral resistant variants and study their dynamics before and on treatment in the attempt to contribute to the understanding of hepatitis viruses resistance associated variants. In particular, we combined allele specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method with eminested PCR method to obtain a high sensitive and specific assay detecting HBV resistant associated variants in low viraemia condition (ASRVPCR). A sera panel including pre- and on-treatment samples from 15 chronic HBV infected patients (n= 5 complete viral response, CVR; n= 4 incomplete viral response, IVR; n= 6 resistance after complete viral response, RACVR) treated with lamivudine (LAM), the first direct acting anti-viral approved for HBV infection treatment, was used for clinical validation of the assay and to study the early dynamics of HBV RVs. The Allele Specific PCRs for HBV rtA 181 and rtM 204 codons showed no RVs in 5 complete viral response patients. On the contrary, resistance variants were amplified before the treatment start in sera of 7 out of 10 patients who experienced therapy failure (IVR + RACVR). Particularly, resistant variants were found in 3 out of 6 RACVR pts and in all the 4 IVR pts, showing a different distribution among the different groups of patients. To further improve our method we decided to applied the sequencing method to the ASRVPCR products of 5 pts (2 RACVR + 3 IVR). The addition of the rtL 180 M secondary / compensatory mutation to the rtM 204 variants during the follow-up was observed in 4 out of 5 pts. The fifth pt showed the rtL 180 M from the pre-treatment till the EOF samples. These data suggest that, in our cohort, the RVs as primary resistant mutations can circulate in CHB naive patients and their presence can affect the LAM treatment, particularly when the rtL 180 M is acquired. Until 2 years ago the HCV heterogeneity affecting the treatment was at genotype level as the Standard of Care (SOC, Interferon + ribavirine) for the HCV infection treatment is high effective in all the patients but those infected with genotype 1 and 4. Thus, web access databases allowing phylogenetic analysis like sequence alignment, genotyping, subtyping were considered enough for HCV. The arising DAAs era in the HCV treatment is now the driving force for the development of new databases and bioinformatic tools HCV dedicated including not only analisys for genotype/subtype prediction but also resistance variants identification. Despite the new interest in creating HCV web access databases, few of them are actually including the necessary informations and tools for a correct identification of resistance. None of the available Databases is intended to be a real updated diagnosis instrument helping the clinician in taking therapy decision. In 2010, a joint collaboration was established between the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) of Melbourne Health, Australia and the Hepatitis C Virus Research Laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS), Australia to develop a web assessable sequence analysis tool (SeqHepC) for the management of patients with resistance to the DAAs for chronic hepatitis C. The project needed at first to collect a limited and manageable number of full length reference sequences from all the major HCV genotypes and subtypes. We used the HCV Los Alamos Database and the tools included for query selection {{of a large number of}} full length HCV sequences. A total of 228 sequences were selected by unique submition, confirmed genotypes/subtypes by Simmonds consensus proposal and by naïve status. An unrooted tree was generated to confirm genotype/subtype of the 228 sequences and among them, 32 strains were chosen from the main branches of the tree. The big skimming prompet us to proceed to the next phase of our project: to focus on HCV NS 3 protease and NS 5 B polymerase to start off with how useful would these genes be for subtyping and if useful, what would be the minimum region for subtyping. The NS 3 and NS 5 B regions were both found to be useful for genotyping and subtyping. We succeeded in identifying a minimal region of 543 nucleotides located in the NS 3 sequence including all the identified protease inhibitor resistant mutations. Such a minimal region was also useful for genotyping and even subtyping as showed by the phylogenetic tree and divergence data. A working version of SeqHepC is currently undergoing alpha testing. The program is designed to enable genotyping and mutational analysis of HCV sequences, which can be submitted either as a nucleotide sequence or deduced amino acid sequence. The input sequence would be compared to the 32 full length HCV reference sequences to determine the genotype, followed by comparison with the reference sequence of an equivalent genotype for the assessment of drug-resistance associated amino acid substitutions. Reports generated are date and time stamped, and will display data including the HCV genome region covered by the submitted sequence, a list of clinically significant amino acid substitutions, and predicted DAAs susceptibility. In conclusion, we aimed to develop biomolecular assay and bioinformatic system to study and identify known resistant variants (in case of HBV) as well as new ones (in case of HCV) in the field of hepatitis viruses. We succeeded setting up a high sensitive and specific method for HBV RVs that could be useful in the future to better understand the meaning of the RVs and also to predict the LAM therapy failure in patient that still may benefit from this cost effective treatment. We also succeeded in the contribution to HCV RVs study collaborating to the set up of a web access database for the genotyping / subtyping and RVs prediction. Such an instrument will be necessary in the next future for the good clinical practice of the HCV infected patients and the management of the new complex therapies...|$|E
