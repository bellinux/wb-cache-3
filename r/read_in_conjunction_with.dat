5|$|Calvin {{developed}} his theology in his biblical commentaries {{as well as}} his sermons and treatises, but the most comprehensive expression of his views is found in his magnum opus, the Institutes of the Christian Religion. He intended that the book be used as a summary of his views on Christian theology and that it be <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> his commentaries. The various editions of that work spanned nearly his entire career as a reformer, and the successive revisions of the book show that his theology changed very little from his youth to his death. The first edition from 1536 consisted of only six chapters. The second edition, published in 1539, was three times as long because he added chapters on subjects that appear in Melanchthon's Loci Communes. In 1543, he again added new material and expanded a chapter on the Apostles' Creed. The final edition of the Institutes appeared in 1559. By then, the work consisted of four books of eighty chapters, and each book was named after statements from the creed: Book 1 on God the Creator, Book 2 on the Redeemer in Christ, Book 3 on receiving the Grace of Christ through the Holy Spirit, and Book 4 on the Society of Christ or the Church.|$|E

Whether zoning restrictions effected by the Outline Zoning Plans constitute a deprivation of property was considered by the Court of Appeal in Fine Tower Associates Ltd v Town Planning Board. The Conditions of Exchange limited the applicant's land use to industrial and/or godown, but the Draft Outline Zoning Plan designated 44% of the land as [...] "Open Space" [...] and 56% as [...] "Other Specified Uses". The Court noted that a deprivation of land could occur not only by a formal expropriation of the land but also by an act which nullified any meaningful economic benefit in the land. It was held that the applicant had not lost all meaningful or economically viable use of the land, as it could still sell the land.

6000|$|While {{the inquiry}} {{was going on}} before the House of Lords in May, Smythe {{impressed}} upon Curll that P. T. had his whole heart set upon {{the publication of the}} letters, not so much on account of the volume which had been seized, as because it was the precursor of a much more important correspondence with Swift, the late Lord Oxford, the Bishop of Rochester, and Lord Bolingbroke.[96] When P. T. disappeared from the scene, Pope is found to have inherited his ideas and to be animated by the desire to complete the schemes his enemy left unfulfilled. [...] "Since I saw you," [...] he wrote to Lord Oxford, June 17, 1735, [...] "I have learnt of an excellent machine of Curll's, or rather his director's, to engraft a lie upon, to make me seem more concerned than I was in the affair of the letters. It is so artful an one that I longed to tell it you--not that I will enter into any controversy with such a dog. But I believe it will occasion a thing you will not be sorry for relating to the Bishop of Rochester's letters and papers." [...] There are no further particulars to explain in what degree Pope had acknowledged to Lord Oxford that he was [...] "concerned in the affair of the letters,"[97] nor does any record remain of the artful device of Curll, or of the new director who had succeeded to P. T. and Smythe. The want of all foundation for the allegations against the bookseller is probably the cause of the vagueness of the allusions. The single palpable circumstance is that, in spite of his lamentations at the publication of his letters, Pope was already designing to send a fresh instalment of them to the press. Whatever may have been the [...] "excellent machine" [...] to which he darkly referred, Curll had furnished him with the pretence he sought. The bookseller put forth a new edition of the printed copies he purchased from P. T., and called it the first volume of [...] "Mr. Pope's Literary Correspondence." [...] Partly, perhaps, to vex Pope, and partly to attract purchasers, he affixed the same title to future volumes, which were principally a medley of trash that had no relation to the poet. Among the promised contents of the second volume were [...] "Atterbury's Letters to Mr. Pope." [...] Pope cited the announcement as a reason for publishing his correspondence with the bishop, which P. T. had enumerated among [...] "the much more important correspondence" [...] that was intended to follow, and which, the poet, in precise agreement with him, declared was [...] "of a nature less insignificant" [...] than the printed collection.[98] The coincidence of opinion between these bitter antagonists is especially remarkable, because others have not been struck with the superiority of the letters of Atterbury. Mr. Croker thought them, with one or two exceptions, dull, pedantic, and common-place, and Warton complains that they are, many of them, crowded to affectation with trite quotations from Horace and Virgil. The excuse for making them public was weak in the extreme. On the 12th of June Cooper replied to Curll's advertisement of his second volume by a counter-advertisement, and offered him ten pounds for any letter of Atterbury to Pope, or of Pope to Atterbury, of which he could produce the original or a voucher. P. T.'s copy, if it existed, must have been demanded when he made his confession, and it is among the circumstances which show this confession to have been a fiction, that the poet in his Narrative omitted to mention the surrender of the important transcript, and never subsequently alluded to its existence. Without copies or originals Curll could not violate the secrecy for which Pope affected to be anxious. The poet, in fact, did not put forth his pretence for printing the correspondence till he had received practical evidence of the poverty of the bookseller's resources. Curll's volume was published on the 14th of July,[99] and Pope's advertisement did not come out till the following day. It was drawn up on the 13th,[100] when he had probably seen an early copy of the book, or he would have waited till the next morning, when he could have <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> the rest of the public the letters which Atterbury was alleged to have written to him. They were three in number. The longest was a statement printed by the bishop, and addressed to the entire world, refuting a charge of having corrupted the manuscript of Clarendon's History. The remaining two were pronounced by Pope to be forgeries, and of these one had already appeared in a Biographical Dictionary,[101] and the other consisted chiefly of poetical quotations. Not a line had oozed out from his private papers, and the argument for divulging them was gone. A man who was eager to drag them into day might use the incident as a pretext, but anybody who did not court publicity would have left them in their obscurity upon the discovery that they continued safe from prying eyes and transcribing fingers. Pope's practice and professions were as usual at variance. He raised a cry of distress at the publication of his letters by P. T., and laid hold of the first hollow excuse for completing the obnoxious design, and spreading before the world that portion of his correspondence which P. T. had been unable to smuggle into print, in consequence of Curll's unexpected revelation of the plot.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSingle-molecule, {{real-time}} sequencing {{developed by}} Pacific BioSciences offers longer read lengths than the second-generation sequencing (SGS) technologies, making it well-suited for unsolved problems in genome, transcriptome, and epigenetics research. The highly-contiguous de novo assemblies using PacBio sequencing can close gaps in current reference assemblies and characterize structural variation (SV) in personal genomes. With longer reads, we can sequence through extended repetitive regions and detect mutations, {{many of which}} are associated with diseases. Moreover, PacBio transcriptome sequencing is advantageous for the identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes, due to its ability to sequence full-length transcripts or fragments with significant lengths. Additionally, PacBio’s sequencing technique provides information that is useful for the direct detection of base modifications, such as methylation. In addition to using PacBio sequencing alone, many hybrid sequencing strategies have been developed to make use of more accurate short <b>reads</b> <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> PacBio long <b>reads.</b> <b>In</b> general, hybrid sequencing strategies are more affordable and scalable especially for small-size laboratories than using PacBio Sequencing alone.

40|$|Since 2000, {{historians have}} {{recognised}} {{the important role}} of transnational travel and information flow in the formation of particular designers’ practices (e. g. Christopher Dresser, Le Corbusier, David Adjaye). Nonetheless, many design histories continue not only to operate within national boundaries but also to emphasise them, despite the acknowledged importance of travel in the development of national design cultures. This chapter presents Teasley’s research into the impact of foreign travel and study on designers in the early twentieth century, another period marked by concerns about national identity, the impact of globalisation on local culture and developing exporters’ presence in global markets. After 1900, the Japanese government sponsored graduate designers’ travels in Europe, America and Asia. This was part of a state strategy for increasing light industry profits in domestic and export markets by strengthening indigenous design for manufacturing. Teasley’s chapter in this peer-reviewed book analyses the diaries, personal photographs, sketches, memos and published travel reports of Kogure Joichi (1881 – 1943) and Moriya Nobuo (1893 – 1927), two seminal figures in modern Japanese furniture and interior design education and industry. The section on Kogure’s travels in Manchuria led to new information on furniture manufacturing as state strategy in Japanese-occupied Asia. The first published research on these sources in any language, Teasley’s chapter offers a close <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> theoretical work on travel, identity and narration to illuminate the impact of travel on designers’ self-formation as members of a transnational and cosmopolitan profession in the 20 th century.

40|$|Despite the conserved {{essential}} {{function of}} centromeres, centromeric DNA is not conserved between species. There is strong evidence indicating that centromeres are epigenetically regulated. Although centromeres normally assemble on preferred sequences, these sequences are neither necessary nor sufficient for centromere assembly. For instance, neocentromeres can form upon sequences that previously showed no centromere function. The {{presence of the}} histone H 3 variant, CENP-A, {{is thought to be}} the epigenetic mark that specifies centromere identity. We aim to understand how CENP-A assembly is influenced by sequence and by chromatin context. Schizosaccharomyces pombe centromeres are composed of a central domain which is assembled in CENP-A chromatin and forms the kinetochore, flanked by the heterochromatic (H 3 K 9 me 2) outer repeat regions. We have previously shown that heterochromatin is required for establishment of CENP-A chromatin, but not for its maintenance. Our analyses suggest that histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases influence CENP-A establishment. In addition, analysis of requirements for CENP-A establishment lead us to propose that a key property of central domain sequences is their ability to direct an environment of low quality pervasive transcription that is permissive for CENP-A chromatin establishment. Genome sequencing of three additional Schizosaccharomyces (S. octosporus, S. japonicus and S. cryophilus) species allowed partial assembly of putative centromere regions. In order to fully assemble the centromeres of these species we are employing PacBio sequencing of long <b>reads</b> <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> analysis of CENP-A and H 3 K 9 me 2 ChIP-seq to define chromatin domains. Intriguingly, although there is no homology between the centromere sequences of the four Schizosaccharomyces, the organization and architecture are similar. We are investigating the hypothesis that despite the lack of sequence conservation, the Schizosaccharomyces centromeres possess conserved properties that promote assembly of CENP-A chromatin and heterochromatin.
