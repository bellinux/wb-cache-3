In this study, a {{finite element model}} of the helicopter rotor blade is {{used to analyze the}} effect of damage growth on the modal frequencies in a qualitative manner. Phenomenological models of material degradation for homogenous and composite materials are used. Results show that damage can be detected by monitoring changes in lower as well as higher mode flap(out-of-plane bending), lag (in-plane bending) and torsion <b>rotating</b> <b>frequencies,</b> especially for composite materials where the onset of the last stage of damage of fiber breakage is most critical. Curve fits are also proposed for mathematical modeling of the relationship between <b>rotating</b> <b>frequencies</b> and cycles. Finally, since operational data are noisy and also contaminated with outliers, denoising algorithms based on recursive median filters; and radial basis function neural networks and wavelets are studied and compared with a moving average filter using simulated data for improved health-monitoring application.

40|$|Imbalance faults {{constitute}} {{a significant portion}} of all faults in wind turbine generators (WTGs). WTG imbalance fault detection using generator current measurements has advantages over traditional vibration-based methods in terms of cost, implementation, and system reliability. However, there are challenges in using current signals for imbalance fault detection due to low signal-to-noise ratio of the useful information in current signals and non-stationary characteristic frequencies of imbalance faults. This paper proposes a method of using generator stator currents for imbalance fault detection of direct-drive WTGs. In the proposed method, the variable shaft <b>rotating</b> <b>frequency</b> of a WTG is estimated from one phase stator current measured from the generator terminal by using a phase-locked loop method. The estimated shaft <b>rotating</b> <b>frequency</b> is then processed by using appropriate up sampling and variable-rate down sampling algorithms. Consequently, the variable characteristic frequencies of imbalance faults in the spectrum of the estimated shaft <b>rotating</b> <b>frequency</b> are converted to constant values. Therefore, the signatures of wind turbine imbalance faults can be clearly identified from power spectral density analysis of the converted shaft <b>rotating</b> <b>frequency</b> signal. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method is effective to detect various imbalance faults in direct-drive WTGs...|$|E

To compute the ground states, we integrate the preconditioned Krylov subspace pseudospectralmethod [5] and the GauSum solver. For the dynamics simulation, using the rotating Lagrangiancoordinates transform [16], we first reformulate the FSE into a new equation without rotation. Then, atime-splitting pseudo-spectral scheme incorporated with the GauSum solver is proposed to simulate the newFSE.

40|$|Dissipative {{processes}} {{acting in}} rotating neutron stars are essential in preventing {{the growth of}} the r-mode instability. We estimate the damping time of r-modes of an hypothetical compact quark star made up by color flavor locked quark matter at a temperature T ≲ 0. 01 MeV. The dissipation that we consider is due to the the mutual friction force between the normal and the superfluid component arising from the elastic scattering of phonons with quantized vortices. This process is the dominant one for temperatures T ≲ 0. 01 MeV where the mean free path of phonons due to their self-interactions is larger than the radius of the star and they can be described as an ideal bosonic gas. We find that r-modes oscillations are efficiently damped by this mechanism for pulsars <b>rotating</b> at <b>frequencies</b> of the order of 1 Hz at most.
