In Wadi Musa the Euro 11.3 million project achieved, for a brief period, continuous water supply {{as well as a}} reduction in distribution losses. The project was co-financed by France and, concerning sanitation, by the US. The Euro 16.3 m poverty-oriented infrastructure project implemented by the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) of Jordan increased access to water and sanitation in two squatter settlements and four refugee camps. The investments in the camps were chosen in close dialogue with the residents who were organized in Community Improvement Committees, and were carried out between 1999 and 2002. The project complemented the World Bank-financed Community Infrastructure Development Project. The Euro 60.1 m Greater Irbid sewage disposal project (1994–2002) included the construction of two wastewater treatment plants and the associated sewer infrastructure connecting 202,000 residents, as well as training for operational staff. Both treatment plants operated satisfactorily four years after they had been completed. <b>Residual</b> <b>sludge</b> is being properly disposed on a landfill.|$|E
40|$|<b>Residual</b> <b>sludge</b> {{coming from}} {{dimension}} stone working activities represents a serious {{environmental and economic}} problem for both stone industry and community. Indeed, most of the time, <b>residual</b> <b>sludge</b> is landfilled because of the difficulties to recover it; such difficulties are mainly connected to local legislation and {{to a lack of}} proper protocols. In general, two different categories of sludge can be identified: <b>residual</b> <b>sludge</b> coming from carbonate rocks (CS) and those coming from silicate rocks (SS). Both of them are characterised by a very fine size distribution. CS is mainly made up of the same compounds of the processed stones (i. e. marble, limestone, travertine). On the contrary, SS is characterised by high heavy metal content, due to the composition of the tools employed during processing activities and to the original rock characteristics. Furthermore, total petroleum hydrocarbon content can often be recognised in <b>residual</b> <b>sludge.</b> In general, <b>residual</b> <b>sludge,</b> management of which in Italy is administered in accordance with ILD 152 / 06, can be used as waste for environmental restoration or for cement plants. Several researches investigate possible reuses of <b>residual</b> <b>sludge,</b> after a proper processing phase, as new products. Such “new products” should be certified not only {{on the basis of their}} technical and physical characteristics but also by means of appropriate chemical analyses to guarantee that the products are not polluted. The aim of this research was to evidence that, on the basis of a correct sludge characterisation, treatment and management, it is possible to produce secondary raw materials (filler, etc.) or new products (artificial soil, etc.), in order not to waste “sludge resources”. Some examples from Italian experimentations are here reported, focusing on the treatment and recovery of SS and CS...|$|E

Sludge was loaded for approximately 2. 5 years, and the beds were left to rest for the remaining period. Three different sludge loading rates were used that represented three different population equivalents. <b>Residual</b> <b>sludge</b> stability and maturity were monitored for the last year. Sludge was regularly sampled and microbial respiration activity indices were measured via a static respiration assay. The phytotoxicity of sludge was quantified via a seed germination bioassay. Measurements of total solids, organic matter, total coliforms, pH and electrical conductivity were also made. According to microbial respiration activity measurements, the sludge end-product was classified as stable.

40|$|Abstract: The {{management}} of <b>residual</b> <b>sludge</b> is a current {{environmental and economic}} problem for many Italian and Swiss dimensional stone quarries. It {{may be possible to}} transfer sludge to local treatment plants where sludge could be treated in order to ensure its reuse. Sludge production is about: 70. 000 t/year for Ossola Valley Basin, 16. 000 t/year for Luserna Stone District and 8 - 10. 000 t/year for Canton Ticino. This paper outlines research that has developed a method to convert <b>residual</b> <b>sludge</b> into loam that can be reused for as a fertile substrata for quarry remediation. Case studies in Val d'Ossola, Luserna stone and Canton Ticino basins describe the reuse of this sludge. It is not feasible to use sludges for farming applications due to their granulometry and physio-chemical nature, as well as their probable contamination brought about by the quarry processing (e. g. TPH: C 10 -C 40). Technological advances have enabled the composting of a mix of <b>residual</b> <b>sludge</b> with green material and nutrients. Bioremediation of this material takes approximately 12 weeks. Initial results indicate that the total petroleum hydrocarbons (range C 10 -C 40) in the dry sludge were reduced by 70 % and that the CFU (colonies forming units) increased within 10 weeks.

The use of oxalic acid is planned to dissolve the <b>residual</b> <b>sludge,</b> hence, helping in the removal. Based on rigorous testing, primarily using 4 and 8 wt% oxalic acid solutions, it was concluded that the more concentrated the acid, the greater the amount of <b>residual</b> <b>sludge</b> that would be dissolved; hence, a baseline technology on using 8 wt% oxalic acid was developed. In stark contrast to the baseline technology, reports from other industries suggest that the dissolution will most effectively occur at 1 wt% oxalic acid (i. e., maintaining the pH near 2). The driver for using less oxalic acid is that less (i. e., moles) would decrease the severity of the downstream impacts (i. e., required oxalate solids removal efforts). To determine the initial feasibility of using 1 wt% acid to dissolve > 90 % of the sludge solids, about 19, 000 liters of representative sludge was modeled using about 530, 000 liters of 0 to 8 wt% oxalic acid solutions.

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{research will}} provide a scientific basis for predicting the long-term fate of radionuclides remaining with the sludge in decommissioned waste tanks. Nuclear activities in the United States and elsewhere produce substantial volumes of highly radioactive semi-liquid slurries that traditionally are stored in large underground tanks while final waste disposal strategies are established. Although most of this waste will eventually be reprocessed a contaminated structure will remain which must either be removed or decommissioned in place. To accrue the substantial savings associated with in-place disposal will require a performance assessment which, in turn, means predicting the leach behavior of the radionuclides associated with the <b>residual</b> <b>sludges.</b> The phase chemistry of these materials is poorly known so a credible source term cannot presently be formulated. Further, handling of actual radioactive sludges is exceedingly cumbersome and expensive. This proposal is directed at: (1) developing synthetic nonradioactive sludges that match wastes produced by the various fuel processing steps, (2) monitoring the changes in phase chemistry of these sludges as they age, and (3) relating the mobility of trace amounts of radionuclides (or surrogates) in the sludge to the phase changes in the aging wastes. This report summarizes work carried out {{during the first year}} of a three year project. A prerequisite to performing a meaningful study was to learn in considerable detail about the chemistry of waste streams produced by fuel reprocessing. At Hanford this is not a simple task since over the last five decades four different reprocessing schemes were used: the early BiPO{sup 4 } separation for just Pu, the U recovery activity to further treat wastes left by the BiPO{sup 4 } activities, the REDOX process and most recently, the PUREX processes. Savannah River fuel reprocessing started later and only PUREX wastes were generated. It is the working premise of this proposal that most of the phase chemistry in the wastes was defined when the acidic process fluids were first neutralized prior to storage. The only notable exception being that some silicates obviously formed later under highly caustic conditions. Waste stream chemistries for each process have been established and surrogate sludges prepared. Aging of these different recipes have begun at 25, 60, and 90 C and the phase chemistry of the different mixes is being monitored. ...|$|R

PPCP residuals contained in WWTP effluent may be discharged to aquatic systems (e. g., rivers, lakes, estuaries), while PPCP <b>residuals</b> in <b>sludge</b> may enter the terrestrial system through land application of sludge-derived biosolids. Rarely are the potential effects of those PPCP residuals on aquatic and terrestrial species considered. An ecological risk assessment framework was therefore developed to allow the quantitative evaluation of potential ecological risks posed by PPCPs in WWTP effluent and land-applied biosolids. In this framework, a fugacity and bioaccumulation model is employed to estimate distributions of potential ecological exposure under various environmental conditions. The predicted exposure estimates are then compared to measured or estimated effects concentrations for each ecological species of interest, in order to calculate potential risk from aquatic or terrestrial exposures. Additionally, the estimated dietary doses to mammalian and avian species {{can be compared to}} toxicity reference values derived from the primary or proprietary literature in order to determine risk from food chain exposures...|$|R
40|$|The {{legislative}} framework in force in Europe entails restrictive effluent standards for sensitive areas, and quite severe {{restrictions on the}} properties of <b>residual</b> sewage <b>sludge,</b> both for landfill disposal and for agricultural use. Several technologies and management strategies have been proposed and applied in wastewater treatment plants to minimise sludge production and contamination. However, their techno-economic and environmental performance has to be carefully evaluated. The ROUTES project, funded within the EU Seventh Framework programme, aims to find new routes for wastewater treatment and sludge management and thereby guide EU members in their future choices. Within this project, the authors have developed and applied a procedure for techno-economic- environmental assessment of new wastewater and sludge processing lines in comparison to reference plants. The reference plants are model conventional plants that experience different types of problems and the new plants are modified plants in which different innovative technologies {{have been added to}} solve these problems. The procedure involves a rating of selected technical issues, estimates of operating costs and an assessment of environmental impacts from a life cycle perspective. This paper reports on the procedure and shows examples of results...|$|R
40|$|Municipal sludge from {{wastewater}} treatment plants is a promising lipid feedstock for biodiesel production as it contains {{a significant amount of}} lipids. However, the energy necessary to remove its high water content is a major inconvenience for scaling up because of the high associated cost. In addition, the expensive conventional sludge drying methods are not effective enough for lipid recovery, thus reducing the potential biodiesel production. This study explores an alternative method, the direct sequential liquid-liquid extraction, which was performed in a batch mixer-settler reactor at room temperature, using hexane as a solvent, after previous sludge acidification showed significant increase in the lipid efficiency. The optimisation study demonstrated that, after three stages, 91 % of lipid from primary sludge was recovered. The optimised extraction gave slightly higher lipid (27 %, dry sludge) than the standard method (25 %, dry sludge), supporting the suitability of the proposed process. Finally, this work demonstrates that the <b>residual</b> lipid-extracted <b>sludge</b> is still a good feedstock for energy production via anaerobic digestion. Anyway, the economic and environmental aspects of biodiesel production from sewage sludge could be improved. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
