The tax on phosphate fertilizers had the lowest transaction costs ($ 0. 94 million), followed by educational programs on best management practices ($ 3. 11 million), the requirement for conservation tillage on all cropped land ($ 7. 85 million), and expansion of a permanent conservation easement program ($ 9. 37 million).

40|$|Pollution-intensive {{industries}} are generally characterized by imperfect competition, increasing {{returns to scale}} and large transportation costs. We investigate two countries, N and S, each with two sectors. Manufacturing generates cross-border pollution which <b>reduces</b> <b>agricultural</b> production. Firms can freely move across country borders, but not workers. First, we show that pollution lowers local income since it <b>reduces</b> <b>agricultural</b> production. This income-reduction effect discourages firms {{to move to the}} country with laxer environmental regulations that generate more pollution. Second, our analysis demonstrates that manufacturing agglomeration forces can alleviate the pollution haven effect. And a pollution haven may not arise, if environmental regulation is slightly more stringent in the larger country N than in the smaller country S. These results are strongly supported by recent empirical findings. In addition, the model predictions call for international cooperation of environmental policies, especially when trade becomes freer. Pollution, Industrial Agglomeration, Trade Costs...|$|R

He develops a methodology for donors and others to craft cost-effective assistance for climate adaptation which can be applied easily and consistently to all 233 states and all three problems, or to any subset. The paper includes two sample applications: assistance for the 20 island states that are both small and poor to adapt to sea-level rise and general assistance for all low-income countries to adapt to extreme weather changes, sea-level rise, and <b>reduced</b> <b>agricultural</b> productivity. quantifying vulnerability, climate change, poor countries, climate adaptation...|$|R
