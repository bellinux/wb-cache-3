25|$|The {{extent by}} which Searsville Reservoir {{serves as a}} source for {{non-native}} species was illustrated when Stanford biologists studied the aquatic fauna found in the plunge pool below the Searsville dam spillway. The plunge pool was drained in 2013 to allow for a safety inspection of the base of the dam. Native species found when the plunge pool was pumped dry include two steelhead trout, 26 California roach and 22 Sacramento suckers. In contrast, more than 1,500 non-native fishes were encountered during the dewatering process, including over 500 sunfish including green sunfish ((Lepomis cyanellus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and likely redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus), two bullhead catfish (Ameiurus species) and over 1,000 mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Other non-native in the plunge pool included 500 bullfrogs and 150 Louisiana <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unlike its {{relative}} the western <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Gramastacus insolitus), the eastern <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish</b> excavates burrows to survive {{during the dry}} season, when the water bodies it inhabits dry up. Burrows are typically between 450 mm and 750 mm deep, although some have been observed as deep as 1 m. Sometimes burrows will have a round chamber at the end or be capped with mud. Occasionally a juvenile will be found sharing a burrow with an adult.|$|R
50|$|Tenuibranchiurus is a genus of {{diminutive}} {{freshwater crayfish}} {{that live in}} the Australian state of Queensland. Only one species has been described, the <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish,</b> T. glypticus.|$|R
50|$|The eastern <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Gramastacus lacus) is {{a species}} of small {{freshwater}} crayfish from coastal New South Wales, Australia. It is distinguished from related species by large genital papilla on the males, large raised postorbital ridges, a laterally compressed carapace, and elongated chelae.|$|R
2500|$|Crustacean {{reproduction}} varies both {{across and}} within species. The water flea Daphnia pulex alternates between sexual and parthenogenetic reproduction. [...] Among the better-known large decapod crustaceans, some crayfish reproduce by parthenogensis. [...] "Marmorkrebs" [...] are parthenogenetic crayfish that {{were discovered in}} the pet trade in the 1990s. [...] Offspring are genetically identical to the parent, indicating it reproduces by apomixis, i.e. parthenogenesis in which the eggs did not undergo meiosis. Spinycheek crayfish (Orconectes limosus) can reproduce both sexually and by parthenogenesis. The Louisiana <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Procambarus clarkii), which normally reproduces sexually, has also been suggested to reproduce by parthenogenesis, although no individuals of this species have been reared this way in the lab. Artemia parthenogenetica is a species or series of populations of parthenogenetic brine shrimps.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to fish, {{several species of}} turtles (such as snapping, musk, mud, map, cooter, painted and softshell turtles), American alligator, aquatic amphibians (such as hellbender, mudpuppy, three-toed amphiuma and lesser siren), and cambarid crayfish (such as the <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish)</b> are native to the Mississippi basin.|$|E
50|$|Species {{present in}} the area include the yabby (Cherax punctatus), <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Tenuibranchiurus glypticus), Richmond birdwing {{butterfly}} (Ornithoptera richmondia), and the Australian fritillary (Argyreus hyoerbius inconstans). Both of these butterfly species are threatened, with Queensland conservation statuses listing them as vulnerable and endangered respectively.|$|R
50|$|The eastern <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish</b> is an {{opportunistic}} breeder, breeding {{whenever the}} vernal pools they inhabit are flooded, usually beginning in early August. Females lay 30-150 eggs {{of a dark}} olive green or dark purple color. The eggs will hatch after 6-8 weeks, usually in late October.|$|R
5000|$|The eastern <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish</b> {{is found}} in parts of Australias fastest {{developing}} areas, leading to their habitat being potentially threatened as swamps and wetlands are drained {{to make way for}} agriculture, industry, housing developments, and golf courses. [...] The species is also threatened by the invasive common yabby (Cherax destructor), which has been introduced into G. lacuss habitats in the Wamberal Lagoon.|$|R
50|$|Taricha torosa, the California newt, is {{currently}} a California Special Concern species (DFG-CSC). Some populations have been greatly reduced in southern California coastal streams due {{to the introduction of}} non-native, invasive species and human habitation. The mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) and <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Procambarus clarkii) have caused the greatest reduction in newt populations.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1990s, Gherardi's {{research}} {{began to}} focus on the problem of biological invasions.

50|$|It has {{not always}} been {{possible}} to replicate these findings in crustaceans. In one study, three decapod crustacean species, Louisiana <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish,</b> white shrimp and grass shrimp, were tested for nociceptive behaviour by applying sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, or benzocaine to the antennae. This caused no change in behaviour in these three species compared to controls. Animals did not groom the treated antenna, and {{there was no difference in}} movement of treated individuals and controls. Extracellular recordings of antennal nerves in the Louisiana <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish</b> revealed continual spontaneous activity, but no neurons that were reliably excited by the application of sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. The authors concluded there was no behavioural or physiological evidence that the antennae contained specialized nociceptors that responded to pH. It could be argued that differences in the findings between studies may be due to responses to extreme pH being inconsistently evoked across species.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} reasons for this decline is the {{introduction}} of the invasive North American signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Procambarus clarkii). The signal crayfish is a carrier of crayfish plague, an infectious disease to which it has resistance while the native crayfish have none. The British species is also sensitive to many kinds of pollution, such as insecticides.|$|E
5000|$|Cambarellus puer is {{a species}} of {{crayfish}} in the family Cambaridae.

50|$|In {{common with}} its creation, the aquatic fauna which {{lives in the}} lake, {{is the work of}} man and casualty, such as {{aquarium}} dumping. The lake's first aquatic inhabitants were native amphibians, but currently freshwater fish, <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crawfish and turtles thrive in the lake.

50|$|When a {{crayfish}} {{is given}} a sudden visual or tactile stimulus to the front part of the animal, the MG activates fast flexor motor neurons that cause the abdomen to flex, resulting in the crayfish moving directly backward, away from {{the source of the}} stimulation. This connection was first demonstrated by C. A. G. Wiersma in the <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish,</b> Procambarus clarkii.|$|E
50|$|Snail kites {{have been}} {{observed}} eating other prey items in Florida, including crayfish in the genus Procambarus and black crappie. It is believed that snail kites turn to these alternatives only when apple snails become scarce, such as during drought, but further study is needed. On 14 May 2007, a birdwatcher photographed a snail kite feeding at a <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish</b> farm in Clarendon County, South Carolina.|$|E
50|$|The {{outlook for}} the growth of koura {{aquaculture}} in the New Zealand domestic setting may be positive, with the potential for increasing demand in the restaurant and tourism fields. Export of koura to the international market may offer less potential due to competition from other established freshwater crayfish species such as the <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish</b> Procambarus clarkii, of which the United States and China annually consume 34,000 tonnes and 88,000 tonnes respectively.|$|E
25|$|As of 2005, Louisiana {{supplies}} 95% of the crayfish {{harvested in}} the US. In 1987, Louisiana produced 90% of the crayfish harvested in the world, 70% {{of which were}} consumed locally. In 2007, the Louisiana crawfish harvest was about 54,800 tons, {{almost all of it}} from aquaculture. About 70%–80% of crayfish produced in Louisiana are Procambarus clarkii (<b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> crawfish), with the remaining 20%–30% being Procambarus zonangulus (white river crawfish).|$|R
25|$|The {{large family}} Parastacidae {{includes}} 124 species of Australian freshwater crayfish. These include the world's smallest <b>crayfish,</b> the <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish,</b> {{which does not}} exceed 30mm in length, and the world's largest crayfish, the Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish, measuring up to 76cm long and weighing 4.5kg. The crayfish genus Cherax includes the common yabby, {{in addition to the}} farmed species marron and Queensland red claw. Species from the genus Engaeus, commonly known as the land crayfish, are also found in Australia. Engaeus species are not entirely aquatic, because they spend most of their lives living in burrows. Australia has seven species of freshwater crab from the genus Austrothelphusa. These crabs live burrowed into the banks of waterways and can plug their burrows, surviving through several years of drought. The extremely primitive freshwater mountain shrimp, found only in Tasmania, are a unique group, resembling species found in the fossil record from 200 MYA.|$|R

50|$|Introduced as fish {{bait and}} stock pond prey, <b>red</b> <b>swamp</b> <b>crayfish</b> are an {{incredibly}} aggressive, prolific, and stalwart species that will prey upon newt larvae and egg masses. The crayfish will also disrupt newt breeding via competition for space {{during the summer}} mating season and physically antagonizing adults. Crayfish will typically maul the adult newts with their claws, and subsequent infection can lead to death. Taricha torosa that are present in streams with introduced crayfish often sport tails with several notches removed.|$|E
