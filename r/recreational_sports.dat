40|$|Predation {{strategies}} {{in response to}} altering prey abundances can dramatically influence the demographic effects of predation. Despite this, predation strategies of humans are rarely incorporated into quantitative assessments of the demographic impacts of humans killing carnivores. This scarcity largely seems {{to be caused by}} a lack of data. In this study, we contrasted predation strategies exhibited by people involved in retaliatory killing and <b>recreational</b> <b>sport</b> hunting of leopards (Panthera pardus) in the Waterberg District Municipality, South Africa. We predicted a specialist predation strategy exemplified by a type II functional response for retaliatory killing, and a generalist strategy exemplified by a type III functional response for <b>recreational</b> <b>sport</b> hunting. We could not distinguish between a type I, a type II, or a type III functional response for retaliatory killing, but the most parsimonious model for <b>recreational</b> <b>sport</b> hunting corresponded to a type I functional response. Kill rates were consistently higher for retaliatory killing than for <b>recreational</b> <b>sport</b> hunting. Our results indicate that retaliatory killing of leopards may have severe demographic consequences for leopard populations, whereas the demographic consequences of <b>recreational</b> <b>sport</b> hunting likely are less dramatic.

5|$|Following a fall in game {{attendance}} in 2009 and 2010, Start decided {{ahead of the}} 2011 season to reduce the stadium's capacity. Advertisement banners were sold to cover the corners, thus reducing the capacity to 11,700 tickets.

40|$|South African {{universities}} share {{a common}} purpose to make sport and recreation accessible to students at higher education institutions, including students with disabilities. Therefore, integrating students with disabilities into the daily activities of any university institution is important {{as it may be}} beneficial for them to participate in recreational activities on campus. This study focuses on the experiences and perceptions of students with disabilities regarding <b>recreational</b> <b>sport</b> whilst at university. A qualitative methodological framework was employed. A sample of five students with disabilities was purposefully selected and face-to-face interviews as well as follow-up telephonic interviews were arranged. A list of cue questions guided the interview to ensure it flowed logically. Interviews were tape recorded (with written consent from participants) and transcribed verbatim. The data from the interviews were analysed using thematic data analysis. Physical, social and managerial constraints are not the only forms of inaccessibility, experience and perceptions, also play a role towards <b>recreational</b> <b>sport</b> participation for students with disabilities. The findings of this study indicated that the benefits of active participation lead to increased cognitive awareness and expression of internal motivation to pursue <b>recreational</b> <b>sport</b> on campus. The findings also denote that being coerced into sports and skill level leading to intimidation are factors that inhibit the pursuit for active leisure participation. This study lends itself to a fresh understanding of how to better cater for <b>recreational</b> <b>sporting</b> needs of university students with disabilities.
