40|$|One major {{challenge}} in nanomaterial analysis, especially in complex environmental matrices, is the unambiguous differentiation between natural and engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). Particularly {{with regard to}} the investigation of ENM's/engineered nanoparticle's (ENPs) fate, analytical methods are needed allowing for tracing and sensitive quantification. Several ENPs are metal-based and contain elements being omnipresent in environmental matrices (e. g., Al, Ti, Zn, Fe and non-metal Si) - hence, high background levels of these elements are expected, compromising sensitive detection. In this work we developed successfully a combined approach of stable isotope labeling (tracing) and reverse postchannel species-unspecific on-line <b>isotope</b> <b>dilution</b> (quantification) in combination with AF 4 /sector-field ICP-MS (AF 4 /ICP-SFMS). The approach was successfully applied to iron oxide nanoparticles isotopically enriched in Fe- 57 coated with a SiO 2 shell (Fe- 57 @SiO 2 ENPs). Upon method development and validation the Fe- 57 @SiO 2 ENPs were spiked into a filtered re-suspended river sediment-slurry matrix for proof-of-concept. Our approach allowed for unambiguous tracing of the Fe- 57 @SiO 2 ENPs among natural iron colloid fractions as well as simultaneous sensitive quantification via reverse on-line ID despite high "natural" iron background. A limit of detection of 2. 4 mu g Fe L- 1 and a limit of quantification of 7. 8 mu g Fe L- 1 in real matrix was achieved. Furthermore, a good reproducibility in terms of peak areas was obtained (0. 4 - 3. 0 %); the RSDs for elution times vary between 0. 1 and 0. 7 %.

Uncertainty propagation {{was used as a}} tool for both determining the analytical approach and validating it. The robustness of close to âexact matchingâ reverse IDMS to correction of measured isotope intensities for multiplicative (mass discrimination) and (semi) additive effects (dead time, instrumental background and isobaric interference) is discussed. The very low experimental relative standard deviation (0. 08 %) of eight replicate determinations indicates the likeliness that all significant sources of uncertainty are taken into account in the low final combined uncertainty statement (Uc = 0. 35 %, k = 2). IRMM- 621 was used as comparator. Uncertainties on IUPAC isotopic abundances of natural 111 Cd and 112 Cd, for the natural Cd solution involved between the two enriched materials, formed nearly 60 % of Uc. The repeatability of the isotope ratio measurements contributed less than 10 %. Correction for procedural blank necessitated calculations somewhat unusual (potential contamination of an enriched material with natural Cd). The procedure also involved a quadrupole based ICP-MS judged to be appropriate for the characterisation of the isotopic composition. For comparison purposes, direct IDMS results are simulated using identical experimental input data. Finally, a significant background signal in the 106 - 116 mass region, observed only with the magnetic sector instrument, was attributed to argon based isobaric interferences. JRC.

40|$|The {{determination}} of uranium elemental concentrations and isotope ratios {{has been a}} major task for the BGS inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) laboratory over the last five years. UK government departments and the nuclear industry have ongoing environmental monitoring programmes which require high quality data. The need for a greater understanding of chemical pathways, sinks and sources has been a driver for BGS to continue to improve analytical performance but with a minimal increase in costs. This study seeks to identify whether isotope dilution could provide a significant increase in analytical performance with minimal cost implications. This report reviews the fundamental concepts of isotope dilution and its advantages over related techniques such as internal standardisation. It considers the potential benefits of quadrupole ICPMS (ICP-QMS) over other techniques where high productivity is an issue, such as for environmental monitoring. The optimisation of the ICP-MS acquisition parameters including peak dwell times, detector dead-times, spike concentrations and operating conditions are examined. Isotope dilution (ID) relies heavily on the accurate calibration of the 233 U spike and the process of <b>reverse</b> <b>isotope</b> <b>dilution</b> is used and discussed as part of this study. A series of experiments was conducted to ascertain the degree of chemical preparation required for accurate isotope dilution determination. These included comparing the effectiveness of using the 233 U spike with internal standardisation by a proxy element, to overcome ICP-MS matrix effects and changes in sensitivity. Finally, the proposed methodology was tested using a range of natural rock reference materials with known uranium concentrations covering various common igneous and metasedimentary types. This project established that the use of 233 U, a by-product of nuclear fuel processing, provided superior precision when used as an internal standard for measurements of other uranium isotope concentrations, compared to indium, rhenium or bismuth. The data suggest that the within sample precision is better when full ID quantification is performed, regardless of the matrix, than when using the spike as an internal standard. The IDMS technique could potentially eliminate the current column separation procedure, which would achieve significant savings in staff time and consumables. A small systematic bias has been observed in the data. It is thought {{that one of the most}} likely factors is the assumption made about the density of the 233 U spike solution, which would affect the IDMS calculations but have no influence when 233 U is used as an internal standard. It will not always be appropriate to use this method for the {{determination of}} uranium isotope concentrations and a decision tree needs to be devised to determine the appropriate method to be used for each potential application. The investigation has proved the value and potential of this methodology for isotope concentration analysis by quadrupole ICP-MS.
