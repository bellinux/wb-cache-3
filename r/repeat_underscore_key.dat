40|$|ABSTRACT. The mutual {{interconnectedness}} {{of personal}} sense and generaliz-able meaning, of subjective grounds for action and generalized possibilities for action, {{is described as}} an existential precondition for individuals as sub-jects in the world. The dissolution of this interconnectedness is madness. Individuals have the choice to acknowledge this interconnectedness and thus constitute themselves as subjects in the world, or they can reject it and thereby surrender themselves to madness. The social contexts that are con-ducive to such acknowledgement or are detrimental to them are briefly sketched, and structural analogies between the madness of persons and that of {{a society that is}} dominated by capital are <b>underscored.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS: madness, meaning, sense, socialization, societalization Since philosophy’s linguistic turn (Wittgenstein, 1969 / 1978), it has become customary to conceptualize the phenomenal world as an articulated network of interconnected and contrasting meanings. The activity theory of the cul-tural-historical school (Leont’ev, 1959 / 1973; Vygotsky, 1934 / 1986) restored the historical dimension to this exclusively synchronic world of meanings, and, at the same time, has identified in it the role of the acting subject by showing that it is not only a world of meaning, but also a world of personal sense. This raises the question of how meaning and sense are related and how closely they are bound to each other. Sense and Meaning Sense and meaning are difficult to distinguish conceptually, because “in con-sciousness they appear to be merged with one another ” (Leont’ev, 1959 / 1973...|$|R
40|$|The {{aftermath}} of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami witnessed extensive housing reconstruction programs by humanitarian agencies in the affected countries. In the most impacted country, Indonesia, in Aceh province more than 140, 000 houses were built by more than 120 agencies. Within a few years it became evident that residents {{found it necessary to}} extend, remodel and renovate and thus transform the houses to suit their own and broader social needs; a self-initiated construction process proliferated beyond the investments by agencies. Key questions arise in such a context: Why must the beneficiaries transform their houses? What needs are not met through the standardised houses? Can particular types improve the capacity for residents to transform their house? Perhaps most significantly, what lessons does such transformation offer that can inform future policy and practice in the field of post-disaster housing reconstruction? This paper addresses such questions and is derived from an in-depth study of the self-initiated transformation process of post-tsunami housing in Aceh, supported by Raphael Vinoly Architects, New York. It outlines the background and context of the process and provides examples of housing that have been and are undergoing transformation, by way of illustrating the nature of and reasons for such initiatives.

40|$|Organ {{formation}} is achieved through the complex interplay between signaling pathways and transcriptional cascades. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway plays multiple roles during embryonic development including patterning, proliferation and differentiation in distinct tissues. Previous studies have established {{the importance of}} this pathway at multiple stages of pancreas formation as well as in postnatal organ function and homeostasis. In mice, gain-of-function experiments have demonstrated that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway results in pancreatic hypoplasia, a phenomenon whose underlying mechanisms remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that ectopic activation of epithelial canonical Wnt signaling causes aberrant induction of gastric and intestinal markers both in the pancreatic epithelium and mesenchyme, leading to the development of gut-like features. Furthermore, we provide evidence that β -catenin-induced impairment of pancreas formation depends on Hedgehog signaling.

In T cells, acetylated microtubules concentrated at contact site with APCs, surrounding clusters of CD 3 and LFA- 1. TcR engagement induced a transient deacetylation of microtubules at early times and an enhanced acetylation at late times. Confocal videomicroscopy studies revealed that the HDAC 6 tubulin deacetylase was translocated and concentrated at the contact site of T cells with APCs. Overexpression of HDAC 6 but not a dead deacetylase mutant in T cells disorganized CD 3 and LFA- 1 at the immune synapse.

40|$|SummaryThe gut {{microbiota}} plays a {{key role}} in host metabolism. Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR 5), a flagellin receptor, is required for gut microbiota homeostasis. Accordingly, TLR 5 -deficient (T 5 KO) mice are prone to develop microbiota-dependent metabolic syndrome. Here we observed that T 5 KO mice display elevated neutral lipids with a compositional increase of oleate [C 18 : 1 (n 9) ] relative to wild-type littermates. Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and liver SCD 1 expression were both microbiota dependent. Analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and 13 C-acetate label incorporation revealed elevated SCFA in ceca and hepatic portal blood and increased liver de novo lipogenesis in T 5 KO mice. Dietary SCFAs further aggravated metabolic syndrome in T 5 KO mice. Deletion of hepatic SCD 1 not only prevented hepatic neutral lipid oleate enrichment but also ameliorated metabolic syndrome in T 5 KO mice.

Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous single-nucleotide change in ETV 6 (ets variant 6), c. 641 C>T, encoding a p.
