5|$|Among Chacoan mammals are the {{plentiful}} coyote (Canis latrans); mule deer, elk, and pronghorn also {{live within}} the canyon, though they are rarely encountered by visitors. Important smaller carnivores include bobcats, badgers, foxes, and two species of skunk. The park hosts abundant populations of rodents, including several prairie dog towns. Small colonies of bats are present during the summer. The local shortage of water means that relatively few bird species are present; these include roadrunners, large hawks (such as Cooper's hawks and American kestrels), owls, vultures, and ravens, though they are less abundant in the canyon than in the wetter mountain ranges to the east. Sizeable populations of smaller birds, including warblers, sparrows, and house finches, are also common. Three species of hummingbirds are present: one is the tiny but highly pugnacious <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbird,</b> which compete intensely with the more mild-tempered black-chinned hummingbirds for breeding habitat in shrubs or trees located near water. Western (prairie) rattlesnakes are occasionally seen in the backcountry, though various lizards and skinks are far more abundant.|$|E

40|$|Territorial {{behavior}} of Broad-tailed (Selasphorous platycercus) and <b>Rufous</b> (Selasphorous rufus) <b>hummingbirds</b> in Colorado was measured at sites with feeders containing 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % sucrose solutions, respectively. The {{presence or absence}} of territory holders, number of intruders, and intensity of defense were measured at the three levels of energy availability. Migrating <b>Rufous</b> <b>Hummingbirds</b> displaced Broad-tailed Hummingbirds from territories they had defended during the breeding season; Broad-tailed Hummingbirds then defended only lower quality sites. Both Broad-tailed and <b>Rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> employed more energetically expensive behaviors when defending high quality sites, with longer chases more often supplemented with chip calls and hovering. Other investigators have suggested that chip calls and hovering are precursors to a chase. However, I found that chasing was the default response to the presence of an intruder. Chip calls and hovering were added to intensify a chase. In the few cases where chip calls were uttered or hovering occurred without a chase, <b>Rufous</b> <b>Hummingbirds</b> were more likely to exhibit this behavior than Broad-tailed Hummingbirds...|$|R

5000|$|Most <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> that {{migrate to}} the {{southeast}} of the United States and Caribbean Islands are juvenile birds and adult females, with adult males seldom seen.

50|$|The northward {{migration}} of <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> occurs along the Pacific flyway {{and may be}} time-coordinated with flower and tree leaf emergence in spring in early March, and also with availability of insects as food. Arrival at breeding grounds before nectar availability from mature flowers may jeopardize breeding opportunities, a factor of phenology possibly determining future migratory patterns linked to climate change.|$|R

50|$|The <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbird</b> breeds {{farther north}} {{than any other}} species of hummingbird, often {{breeding}} in large numbers in temperate western North America and wintering in increasing numbers along the coasts of subtropical Gulf of Mexico and Florida, rather than in western or central Mexico. By migrating in spring {{as far north as}} the Yukon or southern Alaska, the <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbird</b> migrates more extensively and nests farther north than any other hummingbird species, and must tolerate occasional temperatures below freezing in its breeding territory. This cold hardiness enables it to survive temperatures below freezing, provided that adequate shelter and food are available.|$|E
5000|$|The New River is {{the southernmost}} area of record for <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> {{and the most}} {{northern}} for Allen's hummingbirds to have been observed breeding. Snowy plovers are present year-round. Posted areas within the ACEC are {{closed to the public}} from March 15 to September 15 to protect nesting plovers. [...] The spring migration brings approximately 20,000 Aleutian cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii leucopareia) and close to 100,000 shorebirds.|$|R
50|$|The park protects over 50 {{species of}} mammals, {{including}} mountain goat, cougar, wolverine, black bear and grizzly bear. Bird species include golden eagles, sharp shinned hawks, barred owls, pygmy owls, white-tailed ptarmigan, pileated woodpeckers and <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds,</b> {{as well as}} several species of chickadees, warblers and nuthatches. The Stein River contains Dolly Varden char, rainbow trout and Rocky Mountain whitefish, as well as steelhead trout, coho, pink and Chinook salmon.|$|R
40|$|I {{investigated}} the spatial memory abilities of male <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> (Selasphorus rufus) on their breeding grounds, where birds {{can be readily}} trained to feed from artificial flowers presented in two- and three-dimensional arrays. I found that birds use height as a cue when encoding flower locations, preferring to visit taller flowers. Performance in three-dimensional arrays is not however consistently better than in 2 -D arrays. I also examined the possibility that hummingbirds follow a fixed flight path when returning to an array of flowers, as has {{been seen in the}} Hymenoptera. By manipulating the number of doors by which a bird could enter an arena to feed on an array of flowers, I found some evidence that birds do use systematic movements when relocating rewarding sites. <b>Rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> feed on floral nectar, a resource that varies in time as well as space. To determine whether these birds use time as a cue when foraging, I provided them with an array in which flowers were refilled after intervals of either ten or twenty minutes. The birds were able to learn these intervals, as they returned to flowers on or shortly after their expected refill time. I used an analogous experiment to investigate timing abilities in coal tits (Parus ater), a food-storing species, and great tits (P. major), a non food-storing species, in the laboratory. Storers and nonstorers might differ in their ability to time intervals due to the demands, on storers, of reliable cache recovery. Coal tits were able to track the availability of rewards in three different locations associated with reward schedules in the 30 - 120 s range. I found no consistent differences in the abilities of coal tits and great tits to time intervals in the 40 - 70 s range. In conclusion, <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> were shown to use both spatial and temporal cues whilst foraging at flowers. Coal tits and great tits were able to time short intervals in the laboratory, but I found no overall differences in timing behaviour between the two species...|$|R

50|$|<b>Rufous</b> <b>hummingbird</b> (Selasphorus rufus) is {{the only}} hummingbird in the Olympics. They overwinter in Mexico and {{southern}} California, arriving in the Olympics in February or March with the flowering of the Indian plum Oemleria cerasifera.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbird</b> (Selasphorus rufus) {{is a small}} hummingbird, about 8 cm {{long with}} a long, {{straight}} and slender bill.

50|$|Western <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> migrate {{through the}} Rocky Mountains and nearby {{lowlands}} during May to September {{to take advantage}} of the wildflower season. They may stay in one local region for the entire summer, in which case the migrants, like breeding birds, often aggressively take over and defend feeding locations. Most winter in wooded areas in the Mexican state of Guerrero, traveling over 2000 mi by an overland route from its nearest summer home — a prodigious journey for a bird weighing only 3 to 4 g.|$|R
50|$|A sapsucker’s {{tongue is}} adapted with stiff hairs for {{collecting}} the sap. Red-breasted sapsuckers visit the same tree multiple times, drilling holes in neat horizontal rows. A bird will leave {{and come back}} later, when the sap has started flowing from the holes. Repeated visits {{over an extended period}} of time can actually kill the tree. The insects attracted to the sap are also consumed, and not only by sapsuckers. <b>Rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds,</b> for example, have been observed to follow the movements of sapsuckers and take advantage of this food source.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{studies of}} <b>rufous</b> or Anna's <b>hummingbirds</b> in a wind tunnel used {{particle}} image velocimetry techniques {{to investigate the}} lift generated on the bird's upstroke and downstroke. The birds produced 75% of their weight support during the downstroke and 25% during the upstroke, with the wings making a [...] "figure 8" [...] motion.Many earlier studies had assumed that lift was generated equally during the two phases of the wingbeat cycle, {{as is the case}} of insects of a similar size. This finding shows that hummingbird hovering is similar to, but distinct from, that of hovering insects such as the hawk moth. Further studies using electromyography in hovering <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> showed that muscle strain in the pectoralis major (principal downstroke muscle) was the lowest yet recorded in a flying bird, and the primary upstroke muscle (supracoracoideus) is proportionately larger than in other bird species.|$|R
50|$|The migratory {{ruby-throated hummingbird}} breeds {{in a range}} from the southeastern United States to Ontario, while the black-chinned hummingbird, its close {{relative}} and another migrant, is the most widespread and common species in the southwestern United States. The <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbird</b> is the most widespread species in western North America.|$|E
50|$|Calliope {{hummingbirds}} are a migratory bird, generally {{leaving their}} breeding grounds earlier than most birds (although not {{as early as}} the <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbird)</b> {{to take advantage of the}} late-summer wildflowers in the mountains of western North America. They are believed to be the smallest-bodied long distance migrant in the world.|$|E
50|$|Eleven {{species of}} birds {{including}} such as puffins and guillemots have been found on Big Diomede. In 1976 a <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbird</b> was identified on the island. This finding, unique so far in Russia, was very likely due to a dispersed specimen. For mammals, pinnipeds (e.g. ringed and bearded seals, walruses) and cetaceans (e.g. gray and rarer bowhead whales) inhabit the waters around the island.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{the animals}} most {{often seen in}} the monument. Included {{among the more than}} 50 species {{observed}} are red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, great horned owls, common nighthawks, and great blue herons. Geese nest in the park each summer, and flocks of sandhill cranes and swans pass overhead each year on their migratory flights. California quail, chukar partridges, and mourning doves are also common. Others seen near the Cant Ranch and the visitor's center include <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds,</b> Say's phoebe, yellow warblers, western meadowlarks, and American goldfinches. Visitors on trails may encounter canyon wrens, mountain bluebirds, mountain chickadees, black-billed magpies, and other birds.|$|R
40|$|Hummingbirds are {{a popular}} {{attraction}} in any backyard. The ruby-throated hummingbird {{is the only}} species of hummingbird that nests in the Hoosier state.

50|$|Survival often {{depends on}} an animal's ability to time intervals. For example, <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> {{feed on the}} nectar of flowers, and they often return to the same flower, but only after the flower had {{had enough time to}} {{replenish}} its supply of nectar. In one experiment hummingbirds fed on artificial flowers that quickly emptied of nectar but were refilled at some fixed time (e.g. twenty minutes) later. The birds learned {{to come back to the}} flowers at about the right time, learning the refill rates of up to eight separate flowers and remembering how long ago they had visited each one.|$|R
50|$|Many {{other species}} of {{hummingbirds}} also produce sounds with their wings or tails while flying, hovering or diving, including {{the wings of the}} calliope hummingbird, broad-tailed hummingbird, <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbird,</b> Allen's hummingbird, and streamertail, as well as the tail of the Costa's hummingbird and the black-chinned hummingbird, and a number of related species. However, the harmonics of sounds during courtship dives vary across species of hummingbirds.|$|E
50|$|Digital imaging {{velocimetry}} {{was used}} to capture <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbird</b> wing movements on film, enabling determination that the bird supports its body weight during hovering primarily by wing downstrokes (75% of lift) rather than by upstrokes (25% of lift). When hovering during fasting, rufous hummingbirds oxidize fatty acids to support metabolism and food energy requirements, but can rapidly switch to carbohydrate metabolism (within 40 minutes) after feeding on flower nectar.|$|E
50|$|As {{calculated}} by displacement of body size, the <b>rufous</b> <b>hummingbird</b> makes perhaps the longest migratory journey of any {{bird in the}} world. At just over 3 in long, rufous birds travel 3,900-miles one-way from Alaska to Mexico in late summer, a distance equal to 78,470,000 body lengths. By comparison, the 13-inch-long Arctic tern makes a one-way flight of about 11,185 miles, or 51,430,000 body lengths, just 65% of the body displacement during migration by rufous hummingbirds.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rufous</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> {{are also}} able to adjust their {{foraging}} strategies based on when they've last visited flowers and how often the flower's nectar is renewed. Artificial flowers were refilled in either ten- or twenty-minute intervals upon being emptied. The hummingbirds were able {{to distinguish between the}} types of flower and adjust their foraging strategies accordingly. Over time the hummingbirds learned the schedule of renewal and visited the flowers renewed every ten minutes much more frequently than the flowers renewed every twenty minutes. [...] This implies planning {{on the part of the}} hummingbird in order to avoid redundant trips and avoid wasting energy. Similar cognitive abilities and foraging strategies were also observed in a study of the green-backed firecrown, another species of hummingbird.|$|R
