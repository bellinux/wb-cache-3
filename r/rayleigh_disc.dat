40|$|After a brief {{review of}} the work of {{previous}} experimenters with the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>disc</b> an experiment is described in which the disc was placed in the centre of an organ pipe producing the sound. Curves were obtained showing the relationship between the deflection of the disc and the pressure of the air actuating the pipe; also between the deflection of the disc and its width.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an account is given of a {{specific}} acoustical visualization device, called a «Pohlman cell», and its use in an acoustical holographic system. A comparison is later made between lens-less holographic visualization and imaging {{by means of a}} variable focus liquid acoustic lens. The Pohlman cell depends for its action upon the couple exerted on a disc by an acoustic field (a <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>disc)</b> so that it tends to set «broadside-on» to the incident radiation, the magnitude of the effect being proportional to the square of the acoustic particle velocity...|$|E
