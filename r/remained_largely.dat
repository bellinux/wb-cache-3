5|$|Although {{industry}} was rapidly expanding throughout {{the northern part}} of the state, Indiana <b>remained</b> <b>largely</b> rural at the turn of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million. Like much of the rest of the American Midwest, Indiana's exports and job providers <b>remained</b> <b>largely</b> agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, easy access to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Newton first {{published}} his theorem in 1687, as Propositions 43–45 of Book I of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica.

5|$|Among other pursuits, amateur dramatics {{flourish}} (even though Brasenose was an all-male college).

The college <b>remained</b> <b>largely</b> independent of the large public schools. Brasenose's academic record remained solid, if unremarkable; its strengths lay in classics, although one of its most prominent academics– Arthur Evans– studied modern history.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, {{the city}} {{remained}} relatively small, no longer ranking {{among the major}} cities of Korea. During the early 20th century, many archaeological excavations were conducted, particularly inside the tombs which had <b>remained</b> <b>largely</b> intact over the centuries. A museum, the forerunner of the present-day Gyeongju National Museum, was inaugurated in 1915 to exhibit the excavated artifacts.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{bombardment}} began, the German 916th Grenadiers reported their positions {{to be under}} particularly heavy fire, with the position at WN-60 very badly hit. Although the Rangers at Pointe-du-Hoc were greatly assisted in their assault of the cliffs by the Satterlee and Talybont, elsewhere the air and naval bombardment was not so effective, and the German beach defenses and supporting artillery <b>remained</b> <b>largely</b> intact.|$|E
5|$|The BWCAW area <b>remained</b> <b>largely</b> undeveloped until gold, {{silver and}} iron {{were found in}} the {{surrounding}} area during the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s. Logging in the area began around the same time to supply lumber to support the mining industries, with production peaking in the late 1910s and gradually trailing off during the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E

5|$|According to Filitti, the war {{spelled out}} {{the end of}} Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country prey to the nouveaux riches and the neo-Jacobins. As the Conservative Party itself {{collapsed}} into obscurity, he <b>remained</b> <b>largely</b> {{cut off from the}} outside world, and rejected many of the recent innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the bulk of his assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a broker, who gambled it away and then committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|After the Roman Empire {{collapsed}} and the aqueduct fell into disuse, the Pont du Gard <b>remained</b> <b>largely</b> intact, {{due to the}} importance of its secondary function, as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords and bishops were responsible for its upkeep, in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river, although some of its stones were looted and serious damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{both the}} old and new Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets. Despite some attempts at demolition, the underground complex <b>remained</b> <b>largely</b> undisturbed until 1988–89. During reconstruction of that area of Berlin, the sections of the old bunker complex that were excavated were for the most part destroyed. The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque with a schematic diagram was installed. Some corridors of the bunker still exist, but are sealed off from the public.|$|E
