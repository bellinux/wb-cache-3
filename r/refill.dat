5|$|Dan {{can visit}} merchants known as 'Spivs' to buy {{additional}} ammunition and services. He {{can also get}} advice from his ghost sidekick named Winston to learn new moves or to save the player's game between longer levels. Similar to the previous game, Dan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It also depletes completely if he drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game restarts from the last known save point. Dan can <b>refill</b> his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which automatically <b>refill</b> his health if it is depleted. Whilst defeating enemies, Dan's Chalice of Souls will gradually fill up, which can then be collected and traded with Professor Kift to unlock new weapons and items.|$|E

40|$|Accommodation may be {{restored}} to presbyopic lenses by <b>refilling</b> the lens capsular bag with a soft polymer. After this accommodative lens <b>refilling</b> prevention of capsular opacification is a requirement, since capsular opacification leads to a decreased clarity of the <b>refilled</b> lens. It has been hypothesized that capsular fibrosis causing the capsular opacification results in increased stiffness of the lens capsular bag, therewith contributing to a decrease in accommodative amplitude of the lens. However, the change in viscoelastic properties of <b>refilled</b> lenses due to capsular fibrosis has never been measured directly. In this study we examined natural lenses from enucleated porcine eyes and <b>refilled</b> lenses directly after <b>refilling</b> and {{after three months of}} culturing, when capsular fibrosis had developed, and determined their viscoelastic properties with a low load compression tester. Control <b>refilled</b> lenses were included in which capsular opacification was prevented by treatment with actinomycin D. We related lens stiffening to the degree of capsular opacification, as derived from the microscopic images taken with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Overall, the <b>refilled</b> lenses directly after <b>refilling</b> were softer than <b>refilled</b> lenses after three months of culturing, and <b>refilled</b> lenses treated with actinomycin D were softer compared with untreated <b>refilled</b> lenses. The degree of capsular pacification as assessed by microscopy corresponds to an increase in lens stiffness. This indicates that the viscoelastic properties of the <b>refilled</b> lens are influenced by capsular fibrosis and modulated by treatment of the lens epithelium. In conclusion, this study shows that the development of capsular fibrosis negatively affects the viscoelastic properties of isolated, cultured <b>refilled</b> lenses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary <b>refill,</b> poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{validate}} the ability of real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) measures of opacification defect and contrast <b>refilling</b> parameters to estimate risk area (RA) and infarct area (IA) during coronary occlusion and reperfusion. BackgroundNo data exist establishing the accuracy of MCE in determining RA and IA size. We hypothesized that {{in the setting of}} coronary occlusion, MCE should identify RA as a perfusion defect early after bubble destruction, collateral flow to viable myocardium as opacification late during <b>refilling</b> and IA as absent opacification. MethodsThree hours of coronary occlusion and reperfusion were each produced in 11 dogs in which real-time MCE was performed during intravenous infusion of Sonovue (Bracco). Real-time contrast echocardiography was performed at baseline, during occlusion and reperfusion. Early (BEGIN) and end (END) images from a FLASH <b>refilling</b> sequence were acquired, as well as late <b>refilling</b> images (LATE) 1 min after FLASH. Real-time contrast echocardiography defect size and quantitative <b>refilling</b> parameters were compared with RA and IA determined by tissue staining. ResultsDuring occlusion, defect size varied with <b>refilling</b> time; defects from BEGIN images correlated best to RA and those from LATE images to IA. <b>Refilling</b> parameters, but not LATE peak intensity, did not predict the IA size during occlusion. During reperfusion, defects from BEGIN images were well correlated to RA and END images to IA, whereas peak plateau intensity and <b>refilling</b> slope parameters predicted IA size. ConclusionsReal-time contrast echocardiography defect size varies throughout microbubble <b>refilling.</b> Appropriately selected defect sizes and <b>refilling</b> parameters provide estimates of RA and IA during coronary occlusion and reperfusion...|$|R

5|$|Dan's {{health is}} {{determined}} by a health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically <b>refill</b> his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that replenish Dan's health and fill any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player dispatches enough enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the true ending is revealed.|$|E

40|$|Xylem {{embolism}} is a {{limiting factor}} for woody species worldwide. Conifers at the alpine timberline {{are exposed to}} drought and freeze-thaw stress during winter, which induce potentially lethal embolism. Previous studies indicated that timberline trees survive by xylem <b>refilling.</b> In this study on Picea abies, <b>refilling</b> was monitored during winter and spring seasons and analyzed in the laboratory and in situ experiments, based on hydraulic, anatomical, and histochemical methods. <b>Refilling</b> started in late winter, when the soil was frozen and soil water not available for the trees. Xylem embolism caused up to 86. 2 % +/- 3. 1 % loss of conductivity and was correlated with the ratio of closed pits. <b>Refilling</b> of xylem as well as recovery in shoot conductance started in February and corresponded with starch accumulation in secondary phloem and in the mesophyll of needles, where we also observed increasing aquaporin densities in the phloem and endodermis. This indicates that active, cellular processes play a role for <b>refilling</b> even under winter conditions. As demonstrated by our experiments, water for <b>refilling</b> was thereby taken up via the branches, likely by foliar water uptake. Our results suggest that <b>refilling</b> is based on water shifts to embolized tracheids via intact xylem, phloem, and parenchyma, whereby aquaporins reduce resistances along the symplastic pathway and aspirated pits facilitate isolation of <b>refilling</b> tracheids. <b>Refilling</b> {{must be taken into}} account as a key process in plant hydraulics and in estimating future effects of climate change on forests and alpine tree ecosystems...|$|R
30|$|The “last point” on thex-axis in Fig. 4 {{refers to}} “no refilling”, which {{indicates}} the average spacing between Au NPs grown on FIB-irradiated lines without any <b>refilling</b> SAM. In comparison with –SH <b>refilling,</b> the average spacing for the sample without <b>refilling</b> did not change {{with respect to the}} FIB dose. The “no refilling” can be considered as a “saturated” state, in which the density of OMCVD-grown Au NPs is maximized and constant. As an example, the difference between minimum and maximum averages spacing with respect to the FIB dose for the sample <b>refilled</b> with 20 v/v% of MPTS was 121 nm, while it was only 4 nm for the sample without <b>refilling.</b> It is, therefore, concluded that the reason for the average spacing control of the aligned OMCVD Au NPs with MPTS <b>refilling</b> at a fixed dose is due to the density control of the thiols in the binary mixture solution of SH- and CH 3 -terminated silanes.|$|R

5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is a first-person shooter where players {{control the}} player {{character}} mostly from a first-person perspective.

Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles {{as long as they can}} reasonably reach them. It is also possible to climb ladders. By doing so, the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player steps out of the line of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily <b>refill</b> completely depending on how much damage the player took.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} {{white blood}} cell count, which may then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis. A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia. Pleural effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary <b>refill,</b> rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E

However, before any merchant ship was found, defects in her engines showed and on 27 May, the day Bismarck herself was sunk, she was ordered {{to give up her}} mission and make for a port in occupied France. On 28 May Prinz Eugen refuelled from the tanker Esso Hamburg. The same day more engine problems showed up, including trouble with the port engine turbine, the cooling of the middle engine and problems with the starboard screw, reducing her speed to maximum 28 knots. The screw problems could only be checked and repaired in a dock and thus Brest, with its large docks and repair facilities, was chosen as destination. Despite the many British warships and several convoys in the area, at least 104 units were identified on the 29th by the ship's radio crew, Prinz Eugen reached the Bay of Biscay undiscovered, and on 1 June the ship was joined by German destroyers and aircraft off the coast of France south of Brest; and escorted to Brest, which she reached late on 1 June where she immediately entered dock.|$|E

5|$|The {{deposition}} of Empress Irene of Athens (r. 797–802), in October 802, and subsequent accession of Nikephoros I signalled a more violent {{phase in the}} long history of the Arab–Byzantine Wars. Following a series of destructive annual raids across Asia Minor by the Caliphate, Irene seems to have secured a truce with Harun al-Rashid in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of tribute, repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce following Harun's first large-scale campaign in 782. Nikephoros, on the other hand, was more warlike and determined to <b>refill</b> the imperial treasury by, among other measures, ceasing the tribute. Harun retaliated at once, launching a raid under his son al-Qasim. Nikephoros could not respond to this, as he faced an ultimately unsuccessful revolt of the Asian army under its commander-in-chief, Bardanes Tourkos. After disposing of Bardanes, Nikephoros assembled his army and marched out himself to meet a second, larger invasion under the Caliph himself. After Harun raided the frontier region, the two armies confronted each other for two months in central Asia Minor, but it did not come to a battle; Nikephoros and Harun exchanged letters, until the Emperor arranged for a withdrawal and a truce {{for the remainder of the}} year in exchange for a one-off payment of tribute.|$|E

After a first stimulation (S 1) with caffeine, the response to a second stimulation (S 2) depended on the presence of extracellular calcium during an intervening 80 -s-long <b>refilling</b> phase. The S 2 -to-S 1 ratio (S 2 /S 1) was 0. 11 +/- 0. 05 (n = 13 cells) during calcium-free <b>refilling</b> but 0. 72 +/- 0. 04 (n = 36 cells) within 80 s of exposure to extracellular calcium. Maximum mean [Ca 2 +]i during the 80 s of <b>refilling</b> was not different for calcium-free (116 +/- 19 nM; n = 13 cells) versus extracellular calcium plus nickel (2 mM) (121 +/- 12 nM; n = 21 cells); despite this, significantly greater <b>refilling</b> (S 2 /S 1 0. 58 +/- 0. 06; n = 24 cells) occurred in the presence of extracellular calcium plus nickel.
