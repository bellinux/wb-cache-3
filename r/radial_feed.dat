40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a theoretical analysis model and a design procedure to synthesize aperture coupled microstrip patch arrays using a <b>radial</b> line <b>feed.</b> As a first topic, a lossy radial transmission line model is developed to predict slot coupling. With the reciprocity technique and a moment method analysis, key design parameters for realizing a radial line slot array are modeled to formulate the slot coupling problem. By applying the sequential array technique for circular polarization to radial line slot array design, good performance is found for both axial ratio and return loss bandwidth. The aperture efficiency degradation of a sequential array having elliptically polarized elements is investigated by evaluating the gain versus element spacing and polarization ellipticity. A sample design for a 18 cm aperture diameter radial line slot array with 42 % aperture efficiency validates these theoretical approaches.

(2016, "Effects of Process Parameters on White Layer Formation and Morphology in Hard Turning of AISI 52100 Steel," ASME J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., 138 (7), p. 074502). We investigated the effects of sequential cuts on microstructure alteration in hard turning of AISI 52100 steel. Samples undergone five sequential cuts are prepared with different <b>radial</b> <b>feed</b> rates and cutting speeds. Optical microscope and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are employed to analyze the microstructures of white layer and bulk materials after sequential cutting processes. Through the studies we first find out the increasing of white layer thickness in the sequential cuts. This trend in sequential cuts does work for different process parameters, belonging to the usually used ones in hard turning of AISI 52100 steel. In addition, {{we find that the}} white layer thickness increases with the increasing of cutting speed, as recorded i n the literature. To reveal the mechanism of white layer formation, XRD measurements of white layers generated in the sequential cuts are made. As a result retained austenite in white layers is identified, which states that the thermally driven phase transformations dominate the white layer formation, rather than the severe plastic deformation in cuts. Furthermore, retained austenite contents in sequential cuts with different process parameters are discussed. While using a smaller <b>radial</b> <b>feed</b> rate, the greater retained austenite content found in experiments is attributed to the generated compressive surface residual stresses, which possibly restricts the martensitic transformation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHoning is an {{abrasive}} {{machining process}} that can produce very exact results regarding geometry, form and surface quality of the honed work piece. It is mainly used as the final finishing operation for ready-made bores and has to meet high demands regarding process stability and repeatability. As it can create a high ratio of bearing contact area to total area together with a high surface quality it is often used for highly stressed parts. During the process, the honing tool combines three movement components: a rotation around the tool axis, an oscillation along the tool axis and a <b>radial</b> <b>feeding</b> movement of the honing stone. The interface between honing stone and workpiece {{and the movement of}} the honing stone are very important for the process. Nowadays, there are two different control strategies for the feeding movement of the honing stone: feed-controlled and force-controlled honing. While force- controlled honing tries to keep a constant process force, feed-controlled honing feeds the honing stone in certain steps in certain time intervals. The force-controlled approach can bring better results of the process regarding the quality parameters and the tool wear. But to be able to hone force-controlled the correlation of the process forces has to be known. This paper presents a first theoretical approach to the relations beweeen the forces during the honing process. Some parameters that are needed for the calculation are derived from experimental results...|$|R

The <b>radial</b> <b>feeding</b> arrangement {{is used in}} rural networks where reliability is very low. In urban areas, ring feeding arrangements {{are likely to be}} used which provides an alternative feeding arrangement for load. Colombo City uses an open loop feeding arrangement with a normally open point in the ring arrangement. It has an underground 11 kV network where panel substations in a ring (partly meshed) manner are connected around the primary substation. Outgoing feeders from these panel substations are again connected in a ring manner through Ring Main Units. By providing correct directional protection coordination these panel substations can be operated in a closed loop ring arrangement to improve reliability. It will also reduce distribution line losses and improve the system voltage profile. In my dissertation, area fed by Primary Substation F was taken into consideration for analysis. Different time zones were recognized based on load changes for week days and weekends. The possible ring arrangements were identified and load flow analysis was carried out using SynerGEE for radial and closed loop ring arrangement to detail the power loss reduction, voltage improvement, excessive active power and reactive power absorbed by loads. Reliability improvement was derived for SAIFI and SAIDI, using the rate of failure of cables based on the cable failure details of Colombo City. Voltage analysis and cost analysis were also carried out using SynerGEE. Directional protection coordination was derived for two feeders operating in closed loop, two substations operating in closed loop and three substations operating in closed loop to cover the identified paralleling patterns in selected zones. Based on fault levels and the cable impedance data protection settings were calculated for actual field conditions for each pattern. Each pattern was simulated in Matlab to monitor the voltage and current variations for cable faults. In conclusion, if the conditions prevail, the panel arrangement existing in Colombo City provides an easy approach to operate the system in a closed loop ring arrangement by replacing existing numerical relays with directional numerical relays, which improves the reliability, reduces the distribution losses and provides voltage improvements...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHoning is a {{machining}} {{process that can}} economically produce very exact bores regarding form, geometry and surface quality. It is mainly used as the final finishing operation for ready made parts and typically conducted on the inner surface of a cylinder. Due to their specific surface structure which has a good ability to keep lubricants and a high wear resistance, honed parts usually serve as functional surfaces to guide moved parts. Today, the main fields for applications of honing technology {{can be found in}} most sectors of the metal working industry, e. g. the automotive industries, hydraulic and pneumatic manufacture and aircraft industries. During the long-stroke honing process the tool, equipped with one or several abrasive honing stones, is performing three overlaying movement components. These are a rotational movement, an oscillating stroke movement in axial direction and the <b>radial</b> <b>feed</b> movement of the honing stone. This feed movement is one of the decisive factors for the results of the honing process. It can be realized through feed control or, in a more recent approach, through force control strategies. By feed controlled honing, the position of the honing stone is changed in defined invariable steps in certain time intervals. In contrast, by force controlled honing the force of the honing stone {{against the wall of the}} workpiece is measured indirectly by a force sensor, which is located within the feed unit of the honing machine. A required force value is given and, if necessary, the honing stone is fed outwards to reach and maintain a constant cutting force throughout the honing process. This constant force is supposed to produce better results of the honing process in terms of geometric and form accuracy as well as surface structure. The presented research studies aim at improving process know-how to further increase the production accuracy and process repeatability. In a comparison between parts honed with the two different feeding strategies for the honing stone, force components and moments were analyzed and correlated to the phases of the process and several influencing parameters. In addition to the forces and moments measured during the honing process, the quality parameters of the honed parts have also been analyzed and compared...|$|E
40|$|In the {{machining}} industry, {{there is a}} constant need to increase productivity while also maintaining dimensional tolerances and good surface quality. For many classical machining operations (e. g. milling, turning, and broaching), research has been established that is able to predict the part quality based on process parameters, workpiece material, and the machine’s dynamic characteristics. This allows process planners to design their programs virtually to maximize productivity while meeting the specified part quality. To accomplish this, it is necessary to predict the cutting forces during {{the machining}} operation. This can be done using analytical equations for a lot of operations; however, in more recent research for complicated processes (e. g. 5 -axis milling, gear hobbing), this is done by calculating the cutter-workpiece engagement with geometric CAD modellers and calculating incremental cutting forces along the cutting edge. With knowledge of the cutting forces, static deflections and dynamic vibrations of the tool and workpiece can be calculated {{which is one of the}} most prominent contributors to dimensional part inaccuracies and poor surface quality in machining. The research presented in this thesis aims to achieve similar goals for the gear shaping process. Gear shaping is one of the most prominent methods of machining cylindrical gears. More specifically, it is the most prominent method for generating internal gears which are a major component in planetary gear boxes. The gear shaping process uses a modified external gear as a cutting tool which reciprocates up and down to cut the teeth in the workpiece. Simultaneously, the tool and workpiece are also rotating proportionally to their gear ratio which emulate the rolling of two gears. During the beginning of each gear shaping pass, the tool is radially fed into the workpiece until the desired depth of cut is reached. In this study, the three kinematic components (reciprocating feed, rotary feed, and <b>radial</b> <b>feed)</b> are mathematically modelled using analytical equations and experimentally verified using captured CNC signals from the controller of a Liebherr LSE 500 gear shaping machine. To predict cutting forces in gear shaping, the cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE) is calculated at discrete time steps using a discrete solid modeller called ModuleWorks. From the CWE in dexel form, the two-dimensional chip geometry is reconstructed using Delaunay triangulation and alpha shape reconstruction which is then used to determine the undeformed chip area along the cutting edge. The cutting edge is discretized into nodes with varying cutting directions (tangential, feed, and radial), inclination angle, and rake angle. If engaged in cutting during a time step, each node contributes an incremental three dimensional force vector calculated with the oblique cutting force model. Using a 3 -axis dynamometer, the cutting force prediction algorithm was experimentally verified on a variety of processes and gears which included an internal spur gear, external spur gear, and external helical gear. The simulated and measured force profiles correlate very closely (about 3 - 10 % RMS error) with the most error occurring in the external helical gear case. These errors may be attributable due to rubbing of the tool which is evident through visible gouges on the finished workpiece, tool wear on the helical gear shaper, and different cutting speed than the process for which the cutting coefficients were calibrated. More experiments are needed to verify the sources of error in the helical gear case. To simulate elastic tool deflection in gear shaping, the tool’s static stiffness is estimated from impact hammer testing. Then, based on the predicted cutting force, the elastic deflection of the tool is calculated at each time step. To examine the affect of tool deflection on the final quality of the gear, a virtual gear measurement module is developed and used to predict the involute profile deviations in the virtually machined part. Simulated and measured profile deviations were compared for a one-pass external spur gear process and a two-pass external spur gear process. The simulated profile errors correlate very well with the measured profiles on the left flank of the workpiece, however additional research is needed to improve the accuracy of the model on the right flank. Furthermore, the model also serves as a basis for future research in dyamic vibrations in gear shaping. The above-mentioned algorithms have been implemented into a tool called ShapePRO (developed in C++). The software is meant for process planners to be able to simulate the gear shaping operation virtually and inspect the resulting quality of the gear. Accordingly, the user may iterate the process parameters to maximize productivity while meeting the customer’s desired gear quality...|$|E

Process damping is a damping mechanism during the machining process that can be exploited to improve the limited productivity in machining titanium alloy at low cutting speed. In the present study, experiments {{are performed to evaluate}} the wavelength performance of process-damped milling under irregular tool geometries such as uniform, variable helix, variable pitch, and variable helix/variable pitch. The effects of <b>radial</b> immersion, <b>feed</b> rate, depth of cut, and surface velocity as process parameters are also studied. By using flexible workpiece conditions, all tools are tested in machining titanium alloy at low speed to encourage the process damping phenomena. The wavelength performances are calculated {{on the basis of the}} chatter frequency domain analysis extracted from the acceleration signal in the time domain during the cutting process. The effect of irregular tool geometries shows that variable helix and variable pitch tools have the best wavelength performance compared with regular and other irregular tools. The effect of process parameters reveals that the radial depth of cut can also improve the process damping wavelength compared with regular tools. Irregular milling tool geometries with spindle speed and feed rate parameters can be used to suppress the chatter by exploiting the process damping behavior, thus improving machining productivity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMicro {{mechanical}} milling of Stavax (modified AISI 420) stainless steel which {{is commonly used}} in the plastic injection molding industry due to its high corrosion resistance, machinability and wear resistance is studied in this paper. The goal {{of this study is}} to investigate the influence of process input parameters such as cutting speed, depth of cut, <b>feed</b> per tooth, <b>radial</b> immersion percentage, and plunging method on process outputs during circular pocketing operation. Tool wear, machining forces and surface roughness measurements are considered to identify the relationships between process inputs and outputs. It is observed that plunging method has a significant influence on tool wear which in turn affects micro milling forces and surface quality. The positive impact of micro milling with a pre-drilled hole is demonstrated. The relationship between <b>radial</b> immersion and <b>feed</b> per tooth is shown to be important in terms of tool wear and surface roughness...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} develop a coherence function model to describe the behaviour of coherence with tool wear. A cutting tool in turning, typically mounted as a cantilever, is used to explain the model. The dynamic forces that occur during cutting can be resolved into three mutually perpendicular components along the <b>radial,</b> tangential and <b>feed</b> directions. The theory postulated {{that the degree of}} correlation between the dynamic tangential and feed vibration components, measured as acceleration, was inversely related to the rate of tool wear. When the wear rate was high, the correlation was low. Three sets of machining tests were conducted corresponding to the roughing, semi-roughing and finishing conditions. It was observed that for roughing and semi-roughing conditions, in the frequency range of 2. 5 - 5. 5 kHz, the above-mentioned prediction of coherence turned out to be valid; for the finishing condition, there was a greater discrepancy...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we explore {{the ability of a}} {{previously}} developed model of pulsatile flow for explaining the observed reduction of arterial distensibility with heart rate. The parameters relevant for the analysis are arterial wall distensibility together with permeability and reflection coefficients of the end capillaries. A non-specific artery and the ensemble of tissues supplied by that artery were considered in the model. The blood current within that artery was equalized to the sum of all micro currents in the tissues supplied by that artery. A formula emerged that relates changes in arterial distensibility with heart rate, and also with some particular aspects of microcirculation. Then, that formula was tested with data of distensibilities of the radial and carotid arteries observed at the heart rates of 63, 90, and 110 b. p. m. The formula correctly predicted the trend of decreased distensibility with heart rate for both arteries. Moreover, {{due to the fact that}} the carotid artery supplies the brain, and because the Blood–Brain barrier is highly restrictive to colloids in the blood, for the carotid artery the formula predicted a less marked decrease in distensibility than in the case of the <b>radial</b> artery <b>feeding</b> muscle tissue, which has a greater permeability to colloids, a trend that was confirmed by data. It was found that reduction of arterial distensibility with heart rate was greater in arteries that supply end capillaries with high permeability and low reflection coefficients...|$|R
