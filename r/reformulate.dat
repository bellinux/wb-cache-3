40|$|In this work, chaotic indicators, {{which have}} been {{established}} {{in the framework of}} classical mechanics, are <b>reformulated</b> in the framework of general relativity {{in such a way that}} they are invariant under coordinate transformation. For achieving this, the prescription for <b>reformulating</b> mLCE given by [Y. Sota, S. Suzuki, and K. -I. Maeda, Classical Quantum Gravity 13, 1241 (1996) ] is adopted. Thus, the geodesic deviation vector approach is applied, and the proper time is utilized as measure of time. Following the aforementioned prescription, the chaotic indicators FLI, MEGNO, GALI, and APLE are <b>reformulated.</b> In fact, FLI has been <b>reformulated</b> by adapting other prescriptions in the past, but not by adapting the Sota et al. one. By using one of these previous reformulations of FLI, an approximative expression giving MEGNO as function of FLI has been applied on non-integrable curved spacetimes in a recent work. In the present work the reformulation of MEGNO is provided by adjusting the definition of the indicator to the Sota et al. prescription. GALI, and APLE are <b>reformulated</b> in the framework of general relativity for the first time. All the <b>reformulated</b> indicators by the Sota et al. prescription are tested and compared for their efficiency to discern order from chaos. Comment: 13 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
25|$|The Institute also {{attempted}} to <b>reformulate</b> dialectics as a concrete method. The {{use of such}} a dialectical method {{can be traced back}} to the philosophy of Hegel, who conceived dialectic as the tendency of a notion to pass over into its own negation as the result of conflict between its inherent contradictory aspects. In opposition to previous modes of thought, which viewed things in abstraction, each by itself and as though endowed with fixed properties, Hegelian dialectic has the ability to consider ideas according to their movement and change in time, as well as according to their interrelations and interactions.|$|E
25|$|In {{coherent}} sheaf theory, {{pushing to}} the limit {{of what could be}} done with Serre duality without the assumption of a non-singular scheme, the need to take a whole complex of sheaves in place of a single dualizing sheaf became apparent. In fact the Cohen–Macaulay ring condition, a weakening of non-singularity, corresponds to the existence of a single dualizing sheaf; and this is far from the general case. From the top-down intellectual position, always assumed by Grothendieck, this signified a need to <b>reformulate.</b> With it came the idea that the 'real' tensor product and Hom functors would be those existing on the derived level; with respect to those, Tor and Ext become more like computational devices.|$|E
25|$|Especially in fansubs, the {{subtitle}} translator may translate both form and meaning. The subtitle translator may also choose {{to display a}} note in {{the subtitle}}s, usually in parentheses (“” and “”), or as a separate block of on-screen text—this allows the subtitle translator to preserve form and achieve an acceptable reading speed; that is, the subtitle translator may leave {{a note on the}} screen, even after the character has finished speaking, to both preserve form and facilitate understanding. For example, the Japanese language has multiple first-person pronouns (see Japanese pronouns) and each pronoun is associated with a different degree of politeness. In order to compensate during the English translation process, the subtitle translator may <b>reformulate</b> the sentence, add appropriate words and/or use notes.|$|E

25|$|With the {{emergence}} of a compromise government between the more right wing Liberals and the more moderate conservatives, as manifested in the constitutional monarchy, the lack of development and further notable reforms in the country led the more left wing Liberal party, made up mostly of middle class partisans, to <b>reformulate</b> its policy objectives. Thus was born a Republican Party that advocated radical liberal reforms such as universal suffrage, the end of the privileges of the Catholic Church and rents given to the nobles, and above all, the overthrow of a political elite discredited by its corruption and incompetence. The country went into debt and was increasingly dependent on the northern provinces of the country. The humiliation of submitting to the ultimatum of 11 January 1890 issued by Great Britain, an allied nation, was undoubtedly a cathartic episode. Britain demanded that Portugal surrender what are now Zambia and Zimbabwe and abandon its plans to acquire lands in this part of Africa that it needed to connect Angola and Mozambique.|$|E
25|$|The {{first and}} primary {{field in which}} Reform {{convictions}} were expressed was that of prayer forms. From its beginning, Reform Judaism attempted to harmonize the language of petitions with modern sensibilities and what the constituents actually believed in. Jakob Josef Petuchowski, in his extensive survey of Progressive liturgy, listed several key principles that defined it through the years and many transformations it underwent. The prayers were abridged, whether by omitting repetitions, excising passages or reintroducing the ancient triennial cycle for reading the Torah; vernacular segments were added alongside or instead of the Hebrew and Aramaic text, to ensure the congregants understood the petitions they expressed; and some new prayers were composed to reflect the spirit of changing times. But chiefly, liturgists sought to <b>reformulate</b> the prayerbooks and have them express the movement's theology. Blessings and passages referring to {{the coming of the}} Messiah, Return to Zion, renewal of the sacrificial cult, Resurrection of the Dead, Reward and Punishment and overt particularism of the People Israel were replaced, recast or excised altogether.|$|E
25|$|The Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame (Salón de la Fama del Béisbol Cubano) is a {{hall of fame}} that honors eminent {{baseball}} players from Cuban baseball. Established in 1939 to honor players, managers, and umpires in the pre-revolution Cuban League, by 1961 it had honored 68 players, managers, and umpires whose names are shown on a marble plaque at Havana's Estadio Latinoamericano. After the revolution, however, the Hall of Fame languished for more than 50 years, seldom mentioned or acknowledged and with no new inductees. Following a campaign led by Cuban filmmaker Ian Padrón, a meeting was held on November 7–8, 2014 to <b>reformulate</b> the Hall of Fame and to propose a museum in which it would be housed. The reformulated Hall recognized the original 68 members, and a jury of 25 people selected 10 new inductees—five from the pre-revolution period and five representing {{for the first time}} the post-revolution Cuban National Series. The planned site for the new museum is in the José Antonio Echeverría Workers' Social Club (also known as the Vedado Tennis Club).|$|E

They did not consider it a dispute between independentism and colonialism, but instead a dispute between new libertarian ideas and absolutism. The intention was not to cut ties with Spain, but to <b>reformulate</b> the relationship; similarly, the American Revolution was not separatist at its initial steps either. Thus, it would have {{the characteristics of a}} civil war instead. Some points that would justify the idea would be the inclusion of Larrea, Matheu, and Belgrano in the Junta and the later appearance of José de San Martín: Larrea and Matheu were Spanish, Belgrano studied for many years in Spain, and San Martín had spent most of his adult life waging war in Spain against the French. When San Martín talked about enemies, he called them [...] "royalists" [...] or [...] "Goths", but never [...] "Spanish".|$|E
