50|$|During the Mexican Revolution, {{the area}} {{generally}} sympathings with the Liberation Army of the South. In 1914 this army marched to Mexico City {{from the state}} of Morelos against the regime of Victoriano Huerta. Part of that march included the occupation of the Milpa Alta area, forming a base. Here Emiliano Zapata <b>ratified</b> the <b>Plan</b> of Ayala on July 19, 1914.|$|R
50|$|The Mexican War of Independence lasted {{eleven years}} until the {{troops of the}} {{liberating}} army entered Mexico City in 1821. Thus, although independence from Spain was first proclaimed in 1810, it was not achieved until 1821, by the Treaty of Córdoba, which was signed on August 24 in Córdoba, Veracruz, by the Spanish viceroy Juan O'Donojú and Agustín de Iturbide, <b>ratifying</b> the <b>Plan</b> of Iguala.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{statutes}} {{authorizing the}} creation of other executive departments, the contents of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 were never properly codified within the United States Code, although Congress did codify a later statute <b>ratifying</b> the <b>Plan.</b> Today, the Plan is included as an appendix to Title 5 of the United States Code. The result is that HHS is the only executive department whose statutory foundation today rests on a confusing combination of several codified and uncodified statutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} figures behind the Plan were Agustín de Iturbide (who would become Emperor of Mexico) and Vicente Guerrero, revolutionary rebel leader and later President of Mexico. The Army of the Three Guarantees {{was formed by}} the unified forces Iturbide and Guerrero to defend {{the ideals of the}} Plan of Iguala. On 24 August 1821, Iturbide and Spanish Viceroy Juan O'Donojú signed the Treaty of Córdoba in Córdoba, Veracruz, <b>ratifying</b> the <b>Plan</b> of Iguala, and thus {{confirming}} Mexico's independence.|$|R
50|$|The Plan was {{accepted}} by the technical committees from both Israel and the Arab League. A discussion in the Knesset in July 1955 ended without a vote. The Arab Experts Committee approved the plan in September 1955 and referred it for final approval to the Arab League Council. On 11 October 1955, the Council voted not to <b>ratify</b> the <b>plan,</b> due to the League's opposition to formal recognition of Israel. However, the Arab League committed itself {{to adhere to the}} technical details without providing official approval.|$|R
50|$|Riser {{promised to}} file {{legislation}} {{to roll back}} the state income tax hike that became law when voters approved the Stelly Plan, named for former Republican State Representative Vic Stelly of Lake Charles. The rollback took effect early in 2009. Riser maintains that voters were misled when they <b>ratified</b> the Stelly <b>Plan,</b> which cut certain taxes and raised others.|$|R
50|$|At 1955, the Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan (Johnston Plan) was {{accepted}} by the technical committees of both Israel and the Arab League, but the Arab League Council decided not to <b>ratify</b> the <b>plan</b> on 11 October 1955. According to most observers, including Johnston himself, the Arab non-adoption of the plan was not total rejection. While they failed to approve it politically, yet they seemed determined {{to adhere to the}} technical details of the agreement. Moreover, it continued to be taken seriously by Arab leaders. Though the Unified Plan failed to be ratified, both Jordan and Israel undertook to operate within their allocation limits.|$|R
5000|$|An {{agreement}} on a new contract with Boeing's machinists' union paved the way to end the complaint on December 9, 2011 when the NLRB withdrew its complaint. The terms included assurances that a revamped version of the 737 jet will be built in Everett, Washington. After the union's members <b>ratified</b> the <b>plan</b> on December 7, 2011, the NLRB complaint was withdrawn. Boeing will {{not be required to}} build Dreamliners in Everett to make up for work placed in South Carolina, as the NLRB had initially demanded. Union leaders cited the new plant as a reason to ratify the labor accord, saying they knew [...] "the company could and would move work again if the relationship didn't change".|$|R
50|$|The 1918 {{convention}} {{split into}} two separate meetings, Union College, University of Connecticut, University of Vermont, and University of New Hampshire delegates retiring. Clarence Dexter Pierce, {{a member of the}} University of Vermont Commons Club, successfully sponsored a resolution to declare the Federation a Greek-letter fraternity, with its attendant structure and selectivity. The Commons Clubs at the University of Vermont, University of New Hampshire, and University of Connecticut <b>ratified</b> the <b>plan,</b> forming what is now the Phi Mu Delta national fraternity. While the Union College Commons Club intended to join its counterparts in organizing Phi Mu Delta, the group instead elected to refound the Alpha Charge of Theta Delta Chi in 1923 because of pressure from its alumni.|$|R
50|$|This Plan {{took some}} time to draft. It was first planned {{as part of the}} “Ten Year National Economic Development Plan Outline for 1976-1985.” In February 1980, the State Council decided to redraft the country’s mid- and {{long-term}} plans. It convened a seminar to discuss the compilation of the 6th Five-Year Plan. To that end, the State Planning Commission and related departments also carried out extensive research and calculation work on the compilation of the Plan, and organized related experts to conduct scientific appraisals. The 1982 national planning meeting was again mainly focused on the drafting of the Plan. It was only in December that year that the fifth meeting of the Fifth National People’s Congress officially <b>ratified</b> the <b>Plan.</b>|$|R
5|$|Rwanda's economy {{suffered}} heavily {{during the}} 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, {{failure to maintain}} infrastructure, looting, and neglect of important cash crops. This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's ability to attract private and external investment. The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $2,090 in 2017, compared with $416 in 1994. Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States. The economy is managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in August 2015, the exchange rate was 755 francs to the United States dollar.

50|$|Crossing the Alps, Hannibal {{reached the}} Italian {{peninsula}} in 218 BC and won several major victories against the Roman armies. The Romans failed to defeat Hannibal or drive him from Italy, but following Scipio's decisive {{victory at the}} Battle of Ilipa in Spain in 206 BC, Iberia had been secured by the Romans. In 205 BC, Scipio returned to Rome, where he was elected consul with a unanimous vote. Scipio, now powerful enough, proposed {{to end the war}} by directly invading the Carthaginian home land. The Senate initially opposed this ambitious design of Scipio, persuaded by Quintus Fabius Maximus that the enterprise was far too hazardous. However, Scipio and his supporters eventually convinced the Senate to <b>ratify</b> the <b>plan,</b> and Scipio was given the requisite authority to attempt the invasion.|$|R

50|$|The Geneva plan {{replaced}} the 1948 Copenhagen plan. It became necessary {{because of the}} large number of broadcasting stations in these frequency ranges leading to ever more mutual interference (Many countries had refused to <b>ratify</b> the Copenhagen <b>plan</b> and compliance was patchy even among those which had). The Geneva plan entered into force on 23 November 1978 and although its intended lifespan was only until 1989, it is still valid (with small modification by mutual coordination between countries) today. The ability for countries to agree subsequent amendments to the plan has given sufficient flexibility to ensure that compliance has been far more widespread.|$|R
50|$|The LSWR {{had more}} {{success with the}} London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&DR). By Acts of 1860 and 1861 the LC&DR was {{authorised}} to build a line from Herne Hill quite near Clapham to Ludgate Hill in the City, crossing the Thames at Blackfriars, and the short way to the LB&SCR and the West London Extension Railway and the LSWR. Further Acts in 1864 and 1866 <b>ratified</b> changes of <b>plan,</b> but the friendly relations culminated in an Agreement between the LSWR and the LC&DR dated 5 January 1865. An arrangement for sharing ticket income was reached.|$|R

A new road would be constructed along railway siding to extend the current Morfa Road so that the new road would run from New Cut Road up to the Liberty Stadium.|$|R
50|$|The {{widening}} {{project of}} the St. Lawrence River, had been planned since 1941 and included cooperation between both the American and Canadian sides of the river. The agreement, signed 19 March 1941, detailed plans for Ontario Hydro and American power companies to significantly increase the power potential by 1.1 million horsepower, each, from {{the development of an}} international rapids section of the seaway. This was desired to improve wartime power demands although the construction occurred well after the war ended. This was in part, {{due to the fact that}} the United States Congress did not <b>ratify</b> these <b>plans</b> due to more immediate concerns posed by the Pearl Harbor Attack and other interests. The original plans further called to reduce the severity of the rapids at Long Sault by effectively flooding the rapids. Further, a deep water canal was planned for the American side to permit ocean-going vessels to travel further inland. The plans required the Canadian side of the river to take the brunt of the flooding as the shore line in Ontario was shallower than in New York State.|$|R
5000|$|It {{had been}} the stated desire of the member-state governments to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon before the {{election}} so that its articles governing the European Parliament could enter force as of this election. However, this was blocked by the Irish rejection of the treaty in a referendum. Under Lisbon, {{there would be a}} somewhat different allocation of seats, with fewer seats eliminated, leading to a slightly different distribution totalling 751 MEPs. If the Lisbon Treaty is subsequently <b>ratified,</b> it is <b>planned</b> to give the additional seats to the [...] "increasing" [...] countries already before the next elections, bringing the number of MEPs to 754 for a transitional period until 2014.|$|R
5000|$|In 1955 the Unified (Johnston) Plan for the {{multinational}} development of Jordan River basin between the riparian rights holders was finalized.

After the Suez Crisis of 1956 however, the Arab states (with the exception of Jordan) considerably hardened their position against Israel, and now opposed the plan, arguing that by strengthening its economy the plan would increase the potential threat from Israel. The Arab leadership also argued that the increase to Israel's water supply would encourage the immigration of more Jewish settlers, thus reducing the possibility of repatriation for Palestinian refugees of the 1948 war. However, Nasser, the Egyptian president, assured the Americans that the Arabs would not exceed the water quotas prescribed by the Johnston plan ...|$|R
30|$|The County Governor was {{hesitant}} {{to implement the}} RCC’s suggested area zoning for bears before the carnivore management <b>plan</b> was <b>ratified</b> (NRK Nordland 2010). They argued that the areas suggested were too narrow and small; however, the RCC in Nordland <b>ratified</b> this <b>plan</b> in 2011. Interviews with government officials revealed their concern with the carnivore management plan because they claimed that the carnivore zones on the map {{do not reflect the}} ecosystem dynamics in reality. Follow-up interviews with government officials at the regional level revealed that particularly the Norwegian Environment Agency (NEA) but also the County Governor in Nordland and the Ministry of Climate and Environment (MCE) argued for a revision of the carnivore management plan. An official from NNI (SNO) noted that the management plan is meant to bring about predictability for pastoralists, and in accordance with the National Carnivore Agreement and the Regional Management Plan, any bears coming into the areas prioritized for livestock should be culled. However, this is very problematic as long as the population goal for the County as a whole is not fulfilled. The official further noted that conflict is difficult to prevent, as it is likely that, for example, the first family group of bears will establish in an area that is prioritized for domestic livestock.|$|R
5000|$|The Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons {{is a human}} {{trafficking}} action plan adopted by the United Nations in July 2010. Kyrgyzstan supported the plan's adoption, as did Canada, and Mexico {{signed off on the}} plan that September. The plan was first proposed by Belarus. One of the most significant elements of the plan is the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons, which was launched in November 2010 to support {{human trafficking}} victims through financial, legal, and humanitarian aid. In October 2012, the Anglican Consultative Council resolved that the ecclesiastical provinces of the Anglican Communion ought to study and raise awareness about the plan. A meeting of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly at United Nations Headquarters in New York City, New York, United States was convened in May 2013 to assess the progress of the plan's implementation. Francis Chullikatt, Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations, spoke at this meeting, saying that the meeting allowed the international community opportunity [...] "to renew our commitment to work together and to condemn with one voice the abhorrent and immoral practice of trafficking in human beings." [...] At the time of the meeting, there were 39 member states of the United Nations that had not <b>ratified</b> the <b>plan.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The loss of General Reynolds was keenly {{felt by the}} army. He was {{loved by}} his men and {{respected}} by his peers. There are no recorded instances of negative comments made by his contemporaries. Historian Shelby Foote wrote that many considered him [...] "not only the highest ranking [...] but also the best general in the army." [...] His death had a more immediate effect that day, however. By <b>ratifying</b> Buford's defensive <b>plan</b> and engaging his I Corps infantry, Reynolds essentially selected the location for the Battle of Gettysburg for Meade, turning a chance meeting engagement into a massive pitched battle, committing the Army of the Potomac to fight on that ground with forces that were initially numerically inferior to the Confederates that were concentrating there. In the command confusion that followed Reynolds' death, the two Union corps that reached the field were overwhelmed and forced to retreat {{through the streets of}} Gettysburg to the high ground south of town, where they were rallied by his old friend, Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} ten years much {{attention}} has been paid to improving the health and nutritional status of the Vietnamese people. In 1995, the Government of Vietnam <b>ratified</b> the National <b>Plan</b> of Action for Nutrition (NPAN) for the period 1995 – 2000. Poverty reduction was one of the basic social policies given special attention. Several programs have been implemented in Vietnam by different sectors and ministries in an attempt to improve food intake and the nutritional status of the people. The implementation of the first NPAN (1995 - 2000) and other intervention programs to improve food production and consumption in Vietnam during the last decade have been successful. Trends showing improvement in the production of main foods during the last decade have been observed. The population’s dietary intake has clearly improved in terms of both quality and quantity with the consumption of foods such as meats, fish, fat oils, and ripe fruits being much higher compared to 1987. The prevalence of child malnutrition during the last decade shows a marked decrease...|$|R
5000|$|Platt {{served as}} the {{chairman}} of the Committee of Arrangements in organizing New York's Federal Procession of 1788, which celebrated the ratification of the United States Constitution. Contrary to popular opinion, New York had not yet ratified the Constitution by the time of that state's Federal Procession. Once news that sufficient ratification by the requisite nine states had been achieved upon New Hampshire's ratification on June 21, 1788, officials in New York City planned a celebratory procession for July 22, hoping that by that time, New York would have also ratified the constitution. Although New York still had not <b>ratified</b> as the <b>planned</b> procession's date approached, Platt determined that, due to the overwhelming public excitement surrounding the constitution's consummation, the celebratory procession could no longer be delayed, saying: [...] "The day having been more than once postponed in the interesting hope that this state, then in its convention, would likewise accede to the Union, the Committee of Arrangements found it impossible any longer to oppose this patriotic ardor of their fellow citizens." ...|$|R
30|$|Greater Cairo has a {{population}} estimated at 20 million people. It comprises the governorates of Cairo, Giza and Qalyubia. An estimated 7.1 million inhabitants occupy the 370  km 2 area within Cairo Governorate with an estimated 19, 100 people per square kilometre. It is estimated that almost all households in Cairo have access to electricity, but the city fares less well in curbing electricity consumption. On average, Cairo consumes 8.0 gigajoules of electricity per capita but despite this high electricity consumption, CO 2 emissions from electricity are an estimated 477  kg per capita [6]. The Supreme Council of Energy in 2007 <b>ratified</b> a <b>plan</b> to use renewable energy for 20  % of the nation’s needs by 2020. This plan relies mainly {{on the use of}} solar and wind energy, with 12  % coming from wind mills and wind farms and 8  % from hydro-power. Prior to this development, from 1991 to 2005, in an effort to encourage the use of wind energy, a joint project between the Egyptian New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) and Denmark’s Risø National Laboratory created a Wind Atlas for Egypt pinpointing the prime locations for wind farms and wind mills to be used for the establishment of these wind farms. Egypt announced a US$ 350 million Clean Technology Fund (CTF) investment plan in April 2011 that involves a combination of renewable energy production, clean transport and solid waste management projects [6]. In addition, the government has plans construct three pilot waste-to-energy plants in partnership with a private company [5]. The Al-Darrasa site, located outside the boundary of historic Old Cairo, was used as a place for dumping debris and rubble from the city for centuries but in 2005 inauguration of the Al-Azhar Park, a 30 -ha development in Al-Darrasa changed this poor waste management and has contributed to improving the city’s air quality.|$|R

[...] The Oriental Bank had closed the year prior, but had paid its depositors in full. The new institution, to be named the National Reserve Bank, combined aspects of both banks. A special meeting was called for February 18 for final ratification by stockholders. On February 18, 1909, the bank stockholders voted to enact the merger proposed by the directors, to take over the assets of Oriental Bank and merge them with Consolidated, creating the National Reserve Bank of the City of New York. The plan increased capital of the bank from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000. At the same meeting, 23 directors were elected to the new board, including E. A. Fisher and Mortimer H. Wagar. The bank planned to keep the Consolidated name operative until March 1, 1909. On March 2, 1909, Will-tarn O. Allison (W.O. Allison), president of Consolidated National Bank, was voted president of the new National Reserve Bank entity formed by Consolidated's absorption of Oriental Bank's assets. Thomas J. Lewis and R. W. Jones Jr. were elected vice presidents, and George W. Adams, cashier. With the merger of the reorganized Oriental Bank with the Consolidated National Bank of New York, capital was increased from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000. The National Reserve Bank of the City of New York formally opened its doors for business on March 8, 1909, at [...] "the old banking quarters of the Oriental Bank" [...] at 182 Broadway, corner of John Street in Manhattan, until new facilities at the City Investing Building could be completed at 165 Broadway.
