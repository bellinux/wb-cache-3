5|$|Although much of Hornung's {{work has}} fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with {{a wider range of}} themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E
5|$|At Willsboro, Route22 {{heads to}} the {{northwest}} again, away from the lake, until it heads west and intersects US9 {{in the town of}} Chesterfield, the other major north–south surface route up the state's eastern side. Routes22 and 9 join together, closely parallel to the Adirondack Northway (I-87), the only other route in the state to directly connect New York City with Canada. The three routes, spread over many miles {{in the southern part of}} the state, <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> narrow corridor for two miles (3km) until Routes9 and 22 veer east again toward Keeseville.|$|E

5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} on the star MOA-2009-BLG-387L using the NACO imager at the Very Large Telescope array successfully distinguished the star's mass. The collected data from VLT and from observations during the microlensing event was <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> series of models and analyzed. An orbiting planetary body larger than Jupiter (or of a similar size, given uncertainties) was discovered. The discovery of the planet was reported on February 21, 2011 in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.|$|E
5|$|In particular, {{intelligence}} gathering {{played a major}} role. Around 6,000 Belgian civilians were involved in gathering intelligence on German military installations and troop movements and communicating {{it back to the}} Allied armies. The organization was <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> large number of independent groups and included, notably, the large Dame Blanche (White Lady) network. Alongside {{intelligence gathering}} were similar organisations which helped men wishing to join the Belgian Army on the Yser Front escape occupied Belgium, usually to the neutral Netherlands. Around 32,000 were successfully smuggled out which boosted the size of the Belgian force considerably.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} day in {{preparations}} for Friday's landing. After working through their post-sleep activities, Altman, Johnson and McArthur performed a check-out of the flight control surfaces, performed a reaction control system hot-fire, and went through communications checks with managers on the ground. The {{rest of the crew}} worked to stow away items that were used during the mission. The crew held a deorbit preparations briefing with the ground teams, and Altman and Johnson worked with the simulator on board to <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> series of landing simulations.|$|E

Sound engineer Shelly Yakus remembers piecing together the separate vocals, guitar and rhythm section into a master track, with the overdubbing occurring in that order.|$|E
5|$|As NY22 {{continues}} north, it remains, at first, {{within a}} mile of Massachusetts, moving to the east to intersect with NY43 in Stephentown. North of that junction, it begins to <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the Berkshires. Wide curves take the road through Berlin, where Berlin Mountain, the highest peak in the state outside of the Catskills and Adirondacks, caps the eastern skyline. Route22 trends further west, then back east to where NY2 crosses via an overpass at Petersburgh on its way to Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York–Massachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY22, NY346 at North Petersburgh, enters Vermont.|$|E
5|$|Parts of NY418 <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> {{proposed}} tourism district {{known as}} the First Wilderness Heritage Corridor. The corridor, conceived by Warren County, is intended to revitalize the Hudson River corridor by {{turning it into a}} tourist destination. Areas currently being studied for future development include the primarily residential and agricultural areas around Thurman Station, the privately owned train station along NY418 in this same area, and two vacant lots adjacent to the Hudson River on NY418. At some point in time, the entire length of NY418 was included as part of the Dude Ranch Trail, a New York State Scenic Byway that connects Lake George to the Hudson River.|$|E

5|$|The {{light rail}} model {{would have used}} the same {{approach}} as the tram in Ørestad, but would instead have <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> tunnel in the city centre. The tunnel sections would be shorter, but the diameter larger {{because it would have}} to accommodate overhead wires. The system would have the same frequency as the tram, but use double trams and would therefore require larger stations. The metro solution was chosen because it combined the highest average speeds, the highest passenger capacity, the lowest visual and noise impact, and the lowest number of accidents. Despite requiring the highest investment, it had the highest net present value.|$|E
5|$|As M-37 crosses into Lake County, {{the highway}} crosses the Pere Marquette River. US10 follows M-37 through Baldwin. The Marquette Rail line turns westward {{on the edge}} of town, and north of Baldwin, the highway forms the {{dividing}} line between the Manistee National Forest to the west and the Pere Marquette State Forest to the east. The road crosses the Little Manistee River near Peacock and the Pine River in southwest Wexford County. M-37 curves to the northeast {{along the edge of the}} Hodenpyl Dam Pond near Mesick. M-37 turns east to follow M-115 through the community and then returns to a northward course into Sherman and on to Buckley. North of the latter community, the highway crosses into Grand Traverse County. The area around Buckley transitions to agricultural use again. This landscape continues past the M-113 to the area known as Chums Corners. There, M-37 merges with US31, and the two <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> small unincorporated community that is host to Wuerfel Park, home of the Traverse City Beach Bums, a minor league baseball team.|$|E
5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E

5|$|With {{the score}} tied 10–10, Buccaneer linebacker Cal Peterson {{suffered}} a career-ending injury untouched when his knee gave out while running in an interception {{for what would}} have been a touchdown. Lee Roy Selmon also suffered a season-ending knee injury. After taking a 13–10 lead on a Dave Green field goal, the injury-riddled Buccaneers were doomed by an 18½ minute span in which the Broncos scored 38 points. Coach McKay accused Broncos coach John Ralston of running up the score and stormed off of the field, refusing to shake hands with him after the game. He later referred to Ralston as a “horse’s ass” and said, “I don’t like any part of him. His day is coming”. Ralston responded by pointing out that most of the Broncos points came on fumble recoveries and interceptions. McKay later revealed his thoughts on the team’s likely high draft position, saying “This team needs a catalyst. Ricky Bell can <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> wall”.|$|E
5|$|On July 17, 1962, the NYCTA {{announced}} that it had asked the city for money to build a $190,000,000 high-speed, non-stop subway line from Midtown to the Bronx. The line would have only operated during rush hours. It was estimated that if the funds {{were given to the}} project, it would be completed in 1970. The line would be a two-track line running from 59th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues to the Bronx, running under Central Park. Running non-stop for 6.5 miles, {{it would have been the}} longest continuous run in the subway system. The line, on its southern end, would connect to the BMT Broadway Line at Seventh Avenue near 59th Street and to the IND Sixth Avenue Line near 58th Street and Sixth Avenue. The line would then <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> deep tunnel under Central Park until 110th Street. There would be provisions for a future crosstown line under 76th Street to Queens. The line would then turn east and run along Madison Avenue to 138th Street. One branch would connect to the express track of the IRT Pelham Line, which would be converted to accommodate larger B Division trains. In the morning rush hour, trains from Pelham Park would only make express stops. A new stop would be built at 138th Street and Grand Concourse where transfers would have been available to the IRT White Plains Road and IRT Jerome Avenue Line trains. The second branch would continue under the Grand Concourse until 161st Street where it would connect to the IND Concourse Line at 161st Street. This connection would allow for the diversion of Concourse Line express trains onto the new line, allowing for the addition of an equal number of trains to the Washington Heights express service and provide relief to that line. The construction of this line was viewed as necessary to relieve the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.|$|E
