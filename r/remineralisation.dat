25|$|Teeth are {{bathed in}} saliva {{and have a}} coating of {{bacteria}} on them (biofilm) that continually forms. The minerals in the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel, dentin and cementum) are constantly undergoing processes of demineralization and <b>remineralisation.</b> Dental caries results when the demineralization rate is faster than the <b>remineralisation</b> and there is net mineral loss. This happens {{when there is an}} ecologic shift within the dental biofilm, from a balanced population of micro-organisms to a population that produce acids and can survive in an acid environment.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at King's College London {{develop a}} new dental {{technique}} known as Electrically Accelerated and Enhanced <b>Remineralisation.</b> This allows a decayed tooth to effectively repair and heal itself {{without the need for}} drills, needles or fillings.|$|E
25|$|The {{dental plaque}} biofilm {{can result in}} the disease dental caries if it is allowed to develop over time. An ecologic shift away from {{balanced}} populations within the dental biofilm is driven by certain (cariogenic) microbiological populations beginning to dominate when the environment favours them. The shift to an acidogenic, aciduric, and cariogenic microbiological population develops and is maintained by frequent consumption of fermentable dietary carbohydrate. The resulting activity shift in the biofilm (and resulting acid production within the biofilm, at the tooth surface) is associated with an imbalance between demineralization and <b>remineralisation</b> leading to net mineral loss within dental hard tissues (enamel and then dentin), the sign and symptom being a carious lesion. By preventing the dental plaque biofilm from maturing or by returning it back to a non-cariogenic state, dental caries can be prevented and arrested. This can be achieved though the behavioural step of reducing the supply of fermentable carbohydrates (i.e. sugar intake) and frequent removal of the biofilm (i.e. toothbrushing).|$|E
2500|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} {{substance}} {{in the human body}} and contains the highest percentage of minerals, 96%, with water and organic material composing the rest. The primary mineral is hydroxyapatite, which is a crystalline calcium phosphate. Enamel is formed on the tooth while the tooth is developing within the gum, before it erupts into the mouth. Once fully formed, it does not contain blood vessels or nerves. <b>Remineralisation</b> of teeth can repair damage to the tooth to a certain degree but damage beyond that cannot be repaired by the body. [...] The maintenance and repair of human tooth enamel is one of the primary concerns of dentistry.|$|E
50|$|As stated previously, {{fluoride}} {{has been}} proven to positively affect the <b>remineralisation</b> process. Therefore, by using an adequately fluoridated toothpaste regularly, this assists the <b>remineralisation</b> process of any hard tooth tissues.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Example: Demineralisation and <b>remineralisation</b> {{of dental}} enamel in the {{presence}} of acid and fluoride in saliva and plaque fluid. <b>Remineralisation</b> is a natural process and does not have to involve fluoride.|$|E
50|$|Tooth {{demineralization}} is {{a chemical}} {{process by which}} minerals (mainly calcium) are removed {{from any of the}} hard tissues—enamel, dentine, and cementum. The process of demineralization begins at the crystal surface found inside the hard tooth tissue and may progress into cavitation unless arrested or overridden by <b>remineralisation.</b> The effect of demineralisation can be reversed if there is sufficient time to allow <b>remineralisation</b> to occur to counteract the acids in the oral cavity. Together, demineralisation and <b>remineralisation</b> contribute towards a dynamic process.|$|E

50|$|Tooth <b>remineralisation</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring {{process in the}} oral cavity. It {{is defined as a}} process in which calcium and phosphate ions are sourced to promote ion deposition into crystal voids in demineralised enamel. <b>Remineralisation</b> remains imperative towards the management of non-cavitated carious lesions and prevention of disease progression within the oral cavity. The process also has the ability to contribute towards restoring strength and function within tooth structure.|$|E

50|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often used to promote <b>remineralisation.</b> This {{produces}} the stronger and more acid-resistant fluorapatite, rather than the natural hydroxyapatite. Both materials are made of calcium. In fluorapatite, fluoride takes the place of a hydroxide.|$|E
50|$|Statherin is {{a protein}} in humans that is encoded by the STATH gene. It {{prevents}} {{the precipitation of}} calcium phosphate in saliva, maintaining a high calcium level in saliva available for <b>remineralisation</b> of tooth enamel and high phosphate levels for buffering.|$|E
50|$|Ammonium {{produced}} from the <b>remineralisation</b> of organic material, exists in elevated concentrations (1 - >14μM) within cohesive shelf sea sediments {{found in the}} Celtic Sea (depth: 1-30cm). The depth of sediment exceeds 1m and would be a suitable study site to carry out paleolimnology experiments with C:N.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presence}} of fluoride in saliva and plaque fluid interacts with <b>remineralisation</b> process {{in many ways}} and thus exerts a topical or surface effect. A person living in an area with fluoridated water may experience rises of fluoride concentration in saliva to about 0.04 mg/L several times during a day. Technically, this fluoride does not prevent cavities but rather controls {{the rate at which}} they develop making them take a lot longer and making them easier to prevent via normal brushing as it will take a higher amount of acid, usually built up over a number of days, to destroy the created fluorapatite. When fluoride ions are present in plaque fluid along with dissolved hydroxyapatite, and the pH is higher than 4.5, a fluorapatite-like remineralised veneer is formed over the remaining surface of the enamel; this veneer is much more acid-resistant than the original hydroxyapatite, and is formed more quickly than ordinary remineralised enamel would be. The cavity-prevention effect of fluoride is partly due to these surface effects, which occur during and after tooth eruption. Fluoride interferes with the process of tooth decay as fluoride intake during the period of enamel development for up to 7 years of age; the fluoride alters the structure of the developing enamel making it more resistant to acid attack. In children and adults when teeth are subjected to the alternating stages of demineralisation and <b>remineralisation,</b> the {{presence of}} fluoride intake encourages <b>remineralisation</b> and ensures that the enamel crystals that are laid down are of improved quality. Fluoride is commonly found in toothpastes. Fluoride can be delivered to many parts of the oral cavity during brushing, including the tooth surface, saliva, soft tissues and remaining plaque biofilm. Some <b>remineralisation</b> methods may work for [...] "white spot lesions" [...] but not necessarily [...] "intact tooth surfaces".|$|E
5000|$|Oral hygiene {{practices}} {{involve the}} mechanical removal of plaque from hard tissue surfaces [...] Cariogenic bacteria {{levels in the}} plaque determine whether caries will occur or not, therefore, effective removal of plaque is paramount. The removal of plaque inhibits demineralisation of teeth, and reversely increases opportunities for <b>remineralisation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Amine {{fluorides}} have {{a slightly}} acidic pH. For this reason, fluoride ions can combine rapidly with the calcium in dental enamel to form calcium fluoride. This acts as a fluoride depot over a longer period:Under cariogenic conditions fluoride ions are made available stimulating the <b>remineralisation</b> of dental enamel and thus prevent acid attacks.|$|E
50|$|Additional saliva flow which {{includes}} chewing {{products such as}} gums that contain no fermentable carbohydrates can aid in the modulation of plaque pH. Sugar free xylitol is recommended for uses to prevent caries formation. Indeed, {{research has shown that}} the use of gum containing xylitol reduces plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation and enhances <b>remineralisation</b> process.|$|E
50|$|Saliva, {{being the}} watery {{substance}} that constantly circulates the oral cavity, {{is capable of}} impacting both the <b>remineralisation</b> and demineralisation processes. It is secreted through the major salivary glands including the parotid, submandibular, sublingual and Von Ebner's glands {{as well as the}} hundreds of minor salivary glands that are located throughout the oral cavity.|$|E
50|$|Water {{fluoridation}} is {{the implementation}} of artificial fluoride in public water supplies with the intentions to halt the progression of dental diseases. Fluoride {{has the ability to}} interfere with the demineralisation and <b>remineralisation</b> process that occurs on the tooth surface and improves the mineral intake when the pH level may reduce below the neutral pH level.|$|E
50|$|In biogeochemistry, remineralization (US, UK Spelling: <b>remineralisation)</b> {{refers to}} the {{breakdown}} or transformation of organic matter (those molecules derived from a biological source) into its simplest inorganic forms. These transformations form a crucial link within ecosystems as {{they are responsible for}} liberating the energy stored in organic molecules and recycling matter within the system to be reused as nutrients by other organisms.|$|E
50|$|Normal doses may {{occasionally}} {{result in}} white {{marks on the}} teeth. Excessive doses can result in brown or yellow coloring of the teeth. Fluoride therapy typically uses the sodium fluoride form, though stannous fluoride may also be used. Fluoride appears to decrease breakdown by acids, increase <b>remineralisation,</b> and decrease the activity of bacteria. It is believed to work mostly through {{direct contact with the}} teeth after they have emerged.|$|E
50|$|Various {{techniques}} {{exists for}} <b>remineralisation,</b> varying from simple application of fluoride to using special substances for filling materials that {{interact with the}} tooth to aid the process from within. Glass Ionomer Cements (GICs) {{have been shown to}} undergo ion exchange with the surrounding tooth structure, and also engage in fluoride feeding. Research by Prof. Hien Ngo and others has shown that these methods can in practice heal some non-cavitated lesions.|$|E
50|$|The {{balance of}} dissimilatory nitrate {{reduction}} to ammonium and denitrification alters {{the accuracy of}} f-ratio calculations. The f-ratio is used to quantify {{the efficiency of the}} biological pump, which reflects sequestering of carbon from the atmosphere to the deep sea. The f-ratio is calculated using estimates of 'new production' (primary productivity stimulated by nutrients entering the photic zone from outside the photic zone, for example from the deep ocean) and 'regenerated production' (primary productivity stimulated by nutrients already in the photic zone, released by <b>remineralisation).</b> Calculations of the f-ratio use the nitrogen species stimulating primary productivity as a proxy for the type of production occurring; productivity stimulated by NH4+ rather than NO3− is 'regenerated production'. DNRA also produces NH4+ (in addition to <b>remineralisation)</b> but from organic matter which has been exported from the photic zone; this may be subsequently reintroduced by mixing or upwelling of deeper water back to the surface, thereby, stimulating primary productivity; thus, in areas where high amounts of DNRA is occurring, f-ratio calculations will not be accurate.|$|E
50|$|Daily {{brushing}} {{must include}} brushing {{of both the}} teeth and gums. Effective brushing itself, will prevent progression of both dental decay and gum diseases. Neutralising acids after eating and {{at least twice a}} day brushing with fluoridated toothpaste will assist preventing dental decay. Stimulating saliva flow assists in the <b>remineralisation</b> process of teeth, this can be done by chewing sugar free gum. Using a interdental device once daily will assist prevention of gum diseases.|$|E
50|$|There is also {{an aspect}} of minimising {{the effect of the}} caries to control the {{symptoms}} of decay. Constant <b>remineralisation</b> (hardening) with continuous application of fluoride toothpaste is highly common practice that reduces the impact of the caries on decay. Changing the biochemical properties of saliva, potentially through the use of appropriate drugs, can help the buffering capacity of the saliva to resist changes in pH caused by plaque acid, resisting the acid attack caused by the active caries.|$|E
50|$|The minimal {{intervention}} approach to classification was originally introduced by GJ Mount and RW Hume in “A new classification for dentistry”, and later modified by other journal articles and books mainly by Mount and Hume. This classification aims {{to provide a}} useful guide to the clinical approach required in treatment, depending {{on the characteristics of}} the lesion. The first stage is to determine cavitation, then followed by determining the restorative approach to any cavitated areas, with suitable treatment for <b>remineralisation</b> of the non-cavitated areas.|$|E
50|$|Xylitol is {{a natural}} sweetener, {{also known as a}} sugar alcohol. Xylitol {{inhibits}} acid production by oral bacteria and promotes <b>remineralisation</b> of the teeth. It can be found in various products which include chewing gums and lozenges. Xylitol has been found to reduce mutans strepococci in plaque and saliva and reduce the binding of these to the acquired enamel pellicle. This in turn leads to less adherent plaque and a decrease in acid production. In addition, chewing xylitol gum will stimulate increased salivary flow which in turn increases the amount of calcium in the saliva and enhances the oral clearance.|$|E

50|$|As the {{biological}} pump {{plays an important}} role in the Earth's carbon cycle, significant effort is spent quantifying its strength. However, because they occur as a result of poorly constrained ecological interactions usually at depth, the processes that form {{the biological}} pump are difficult to measure. A common method is to estimate primary production fuelled by nitrate and ammonium as these nutrients have different sources that are related to the <b>remineralisation</b> of sinking material. From these it is possible to derive the so-called f-ratio, a proxy for the local strength of the biological pump. Applying the results of local studies to the global scale are complicated by the role the ocean's circulation plays in different ocean regions.|$|E
50|$|As the {{demineralisation}} process continues, the pH of {{the mouth}} becomes more acidic which promotes the development of cavities. Dissolved minerals then diffuse out of the tooth structure and into the saliva surrounding the tooth. The buffering capacity of saliva greatly impacts the pH of plaque surrounding the enamel, thereby inhibiting caries progression. Plaque thickness {{and the number of}} bacteria present determine the effectiveness of salivary buffers. The high salivary concentrations of calcium and phosphate which are maintained by salivary proteins may account for the development and <b>remineralisation</b> of enamel. The presence of fluoride in saliva speeds up crystal precipitation forming a fluorapatite- like coating which will be more resistant to caries.|$|E
50|$|Bacterioplankton {{occupy a}} range of {{ecological}} niches in marine and aquatic ecosystems. They are both primary producers and primary consumers in these ecosystems and drive global biogeochemical cycling of elements essential for life (e.g., carbon and nitrogen fixation). Many are saprotrophic, and obtain energy by consuming organic material produced by other organisms. This material may be dissolved in the medium and taken directly from there, or bacteria may live and grow in association with particulate material such as marine snow. Many other bacterioplankton species are autotrophic, and derive energy from either photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. The latter are often categorised as picophytoplankton, and include cyanobacterial groups such as Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. Bacterioplankton play critical roles in global nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, <b>remineralisation</b> and methanogenesis.|$|E
50|$|Tooth decay can {{be managed}} by modifying {{behaviour}} and controlling its causative factors, i.e. reducing the intake frequency of fermentable carbohydrates from food. This will reduce the chance of the dental biofilm developing into cariogenic biofilm. The bacteria in cariogenic biofilm produce organic acids when carbohydrates, especially sugar, are eaten. When enough acid is produced so that the pH goes below 5.5, the acid dissolves carbonated hydroxyapatite, {{the main component of}} tooth enamel, in a process known as demineralisation. After the sugar is gone, the mineral loss can be recovered—or remineralised—from ions dissolved in the saliva. Cavities result when the rate of demineralisation exceeds the rate of <b>remineralisation</b> and the latticework is destroyed, typically in a process that requires many months or years.|$|E
50|$|Sucrose (table sugar) is most {{commonly}} associated with cavities. The amount of sugar consumed {{at any one time}} is less important than how often food and drinks that contain sugar are consumed. The more frequently sugars are consumed, the greater the time during which the tooth is exposed to low pH levels, at which point demineralisation occurs (below 5.5 for most people). It is important therefore to try to encourage infrequent consumption of food and drinks containing sugar so that teeth have a chance to be repaired by <b>remineralisation</b> and fluoride. Limiting sugar-containing foods and drinks to meal times is one way to reduce the incidence of cavities. Sugars from fruit and fruit juices, e.g., glucose, fructose, and maltose can also cause cavities.|$|E
50|$|The {{dental plaque}} biofilm {{can result in}} the disease dental caries if it is allowed to develop over time. An ecologic shift away from {{balanced}} populations within the dental biofilm is driven by certain (cariogenic) microbiological populations beginning to dominate when the environment favours them. The shift to an acidogenic, aciduric, and cariogenic microbiological population develops and is maintained by frequent consumption of fermentable dietary carbohydrate. The resulting activity shift in the biofilm (and resulting acid production within the biofilm, at the tooth surface) is associated with an imbalance between demineralization and <b>remineralisation</b> leading to net mineral loss within dental hard tissues (enamel and then dentin), the sign and symptom being a carious lesion.

This can be achieved though the behavioural step of reducing the supply of fermentable carbohydrates (i.e. sugar intake) and frequent removal of the biofilm (i.e. toothbrushing).|$|E
50|$|Decay is {{the process}} or result of {{demineralisation}} (softening) of an area of dental tissue, creating a decayed lesion on the tooth. The process of restoring decay begins with {{an analysis of the}} decayed lesions together with their location and severity, with particular regard to the state of reversibility. Where decay is reversible, it is referred to as non-cavitated decay, where healing is possible by the hardening process of <b>remineralisation.</b> Where a cavity has formed from excessive demineralisation, the decay has reached {{the point of no return}} where the tooth structure has been lost and the decay is permanent and non-reversible. In this situation of cavitated decay, the cavity will have to be filled to restore the tooth. Minimal intervention dentistry is focused on filling only cavitated regions, leaving non-cavitated decay to be remineralised, thus restoring the tooth while removing as little of the tooth structure as possible, enhancing the strength and aesthetics of the restoration. Classifications of the location and severity of decay are made in order to establish guidelines for suitable treatment methods.|$|E
