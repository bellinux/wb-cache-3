25|$|In 1851, Brittany had around 2.7 million {{inhabitants}} and the demographic growth stayed low {{until the second}} half of the 20th century, mainly because of an important emigration.

Without the Loire-Atlantique's figures, the Breton population only numbered 2.4 million in 1962, nearly unchanged from its population of 2.3 million in 1851. After the 1960s, the whole region has had a strong demographic growth because of the decline of the traditional emigration to richer French regions.
