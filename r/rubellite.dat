25|$|Some {{tourmaline}} gems, especially pink to red colored stones, are {{altered by}} heat treatment {{to improve their}} color. Overly dark red stones can be lightened by careful heat treatment. The pink color in manganese-containing near-colorless to pale pink stones can be greatly increased by irradiation with gamma-rays or electron beams. Irradiation {{is almost impossible to}} detect in tourmalines, and does not, currently, impact the value. Heavily included tourmalines, such as <b>rubellite</b> and Brazilian paraiba, are sometimes clarity-enhanced. A clarity-enhanced tourmaline (especially the paraiba variety) is worth much less than a non-treated gem.|$|E
25|$|Imitation rubies {{are also}} marketed. Red spinels, red garnets, and colored glass have been falsely {{claimed to be}} rubies. Imitations go back to Roman times and already in the 17th century {{techniques}} were developed to color foil red—by burning scarlet wool in the bottom part of the furnace—which was then placed under the imitation stone. Trade terms such as balas ruby for red spinel and <b>rubellite</b> for red tourmaline can mislead unsuspecting buyers.

25|$|Another highly {{valuable}} {{variety is}} chrome tourmaline, a rare type of dravite tourmaline from Tanzania.

Of the standard elbaite colors, blue indicolite gems are typically the most valuable, followed by green verdelite and pink to red <b>rubellite.</b> There are also yellow tourmalines, sometimes known as canary tourmaline. Zambia is rich in both red and yellow tourmaline, which are relatively inexpensive in that country. Ironically the rarest variety, colorless achroite, is not appreciated and is the least expensive of the transparent tourmalines.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. Seven {{chemical}} analyses of pink or green tourmalines {{belonging to the}} elbalte-schorl series, along with their physical, optical, and X-ray data are presented. Linear variation diagrams showing the relationship between composition and refractive indices, specific gravities, and cell parameters are constructed. Relationship between colour and chemical composition is also discussed. THE Meldon aplite, Devonshire, is a soda-lithia plite dyke about 6 o to 8 o ft in thick-ness, occurring three-quarters of a mile north-west of the main Dartmoor granite (Worth, 192 o). The aplite has been cut and metasomatized by a multitude of succes-sive generations of thin (2 to 7 cm) K- and Li-rich veins containing tourmaline crystals. The magmatic veins of earlier generations and surrounding contemporaneously metasomatized aplites contain green tourmalines whereas the later pneumatolytic-hydrothermal veins and associated or contemporaneously metasomatized aplite contains pink tourmaline (<b>rubellite).</b> Four samples (Table I), M. P. T., MI 8, M 2 oo, and MI 7 belong to the <b>rubellite</b> variety of elbaite (MI 7 being paler pink than the others) and three samples, M 5, MK 653, and R. A. H. are verdelites (green-coloured elbaites) ...|$|E
40|$|Perhaps {{more than}} any other gemstone, {{tourmaline}} is renowned for its spectrum of colors, even within individual crystals (FIG. 1). In addition, tourmaline has the appropriate combination of beauty, durability, and rarity to make fi ne gemstones. Its moderate refractive index (~ 1. 61 – 1. 67; see also Hawthorne and Dirlam 2011 this issue) gives signifi-cant return of light, and its chemical complexity produces a wide range of appealing colors. Its relatively high hard-ness (7 on the Mohs scale) makes it less likely to be scratched, and its lack of cleavage makes it unlikely to fracture during wear. Its growth as highly transparent material, mostly free of internal fl aws, provides the gem-quality crystals required for cutting faceted stones (FIG. 1). These attributes make tourmaline well suited for fash-ioning, and it is available in suffi cient quantities to support a commercial market. Gemmy crystals of tourmaline with sharp, undamaged morphology and rich colors are collected by mineral connoisseurs (FIG. 2), and cut stones are mounted into jewelry (FIG. 3). Clearly, tourmaline {{is one of the most}} important gem materials on the market today. HISTORIC HIGHLIGHTS Tourmaline gemstones have a distinguished and colorful history. At the beginning of the 18 th century, Amsterdam lapidaries noticed that in mixed parcels of gem rough from Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), there were some gems character-ized by relatively low density (~ 3. 07 g/cm 3), and they were given the name turamalin. These were thought to be a new type of gem, having gone unrecognized for some time, and by 1717 they were referred to as pierre de Ceylon (King 2002). Nevertheless, the name turamalin was retained, and in the second half of the 18 th century the spelling changed to tourmalin. In 1771 the term tourmaline garnet was coined, probably referring to <b>rubellite</b> (the pink to red gem variety of tourmaline). Until the early 18 th century there were only small amounts of Ceylonese gem tourmaline on the market. In the late 18 th century the discovery of <b>rubellite</b> deposits near Nerchinsk, Siberia, and the fi nds of Brazilian tourmalines, referred to as smaragdus brasilicus, produced signifi cant quantities of gem tour...|$|E
