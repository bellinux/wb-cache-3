5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO), {{which focuses}} on {{international}} health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, <b>river</b> <b>blindness,</b> and leprosy. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic. The UN Population Fund, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they depend}} on the human host for part of their life-cycle, {{diseases}} such as African schistosomiasis, <b>river</b> <b>blindness,</b> and elephantiasis are not defined as zoonotic, {{even though they may}} depend on transmission by insects or other vectors.|$|E
25|$|According to the World Health Organization, {{the most}} common {{diseases}} in Ghana include those endemic to sub-Saharan African countries, particularly: cholera, typhoid, pulmonary tuberculosis, anthrax, pertussis, tetanus, chicken pox, yellow fever, measles, infectious hepatitis, trachoma, malaria, HIV and schistosomiasis. Though not as common, other regularly treated diseases include dracunculiasis, dysentery, <b>river</b> <b>blindness</b> or onchocerciasis, several kinds of pneumonia, dehydration, venereal diseases, and poliomyelitis.|$|E
25|$|Robert McNamara {{served as}} head of the World Bank from April 1968 to June 1981, when he turned 65. In his 13 years at the Bank, he {{introduced}} key changes, most notably, shifting the Bank's focus toward targeted poverty reduction. He negotiated, with the conflicting countries represented on the Board, a growth in funds to channel credits for development, in the form of health, food, and education projects. He also instituted new methods of evaluating the effectiveness of funded projects. One notable project started during McNamara's tenure was the effort to prevent <b>river</b> <b>blindness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in the mostly rural areas, the Cuban doctors discovered that many people suffered chronic, long-term illnesses. Instead of broken bones, they were treating <b>river</b> <b>blindness</b> and stunted growth. In places like the Mosquito Coast of Honduras, the Cubans were the first doctors the patients had ever seen. In support of this plan, ELAM was opened in March 1999 and started its full medical program in September 1999 with approximately 1,900 student in its initial classes. On November 15, 1999, Castro officially inaugurated ELAM at as Havana hosted the 9th Ibero-American Summit (at this time, ELAM had 1,929 students from 18 countries).|$|E
25|$|Epidemics of cholera, malaria, rabies and African hemorrhagic fevers like Marburg hemorrhagic fever, {{are common}} {{diseases}} in several {{parts of the}} country. Many regions {{in this country have}} high incidence rates of tuberculosis and high HIV prevalence rates. Dengue, filariasis, leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis (<b>river</b> <b>blindness)</b> are other diseases carried by insects that also occur in the region. Angola {{has one of the highest}} infant mortality rates in the world and one of the world's lowest life expectancies. A 2007 survey concluded that low and deficient niacin status was common in Angola. Demographic and Health Surveys is currently conducting several surveys in Angola on malaria, domestic violence and more.|$|E
25|$|From 1936 to 1958, Browne {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} the mission hospital at Yakusu, Belgian Congo. At Yakusu, he performed {{a wide range of}} roles from treating disease outbreaks and researching diseases to performing operations to midwifery. Patients {{with a wide variety of}} ailments arrived from surrounding areas daily to seek care. He frequently handled outbreaks of smallpox, polio, tuberculosis, malaria, yaws and typhoid and made major breakthroughs in the treatment of leprosy and Onchocerciasis. Browne, who would later concentrate his studies on leprosy, was the one of the first doctors to use Dapsone in the treatment of leprosy. He made a major epidemiological breakthrough related to Onchocerciasis, commonly known as <b>river</b> <b>blindness,</b> when he discovered it was caused by a black fly that bred on crabs. After having the crabs caught and exterminated and the streams cleaned, 98% of the black fly population had disappeared. Despite being based in Yakusu, Browne embarked on frequent expeditions to surrounding dispensaries and mission stations, travelling by car, motor boat, canoe or on foot. The doctors of Yakusu were often called to surrounding areas to provide medical care to acutely ill or injured patients.|$|E

[...] The many years of faculty experience in Nigeria created {{the foundation for a}} major MSU African Studies Center. By the 1990s MSU had the largest faculty in the nation of Africa specialists (170) and was producing more Ph.D.s on Africa, offering more study abroad in Africa (26), and teaching more African languages (30) than any other university. The faculty is deeply engaged in many African development problems in food security, health (especially tropical diseases such as malaria, <b>river</b> <b>blindness,</b> and filariasis), education, and gender equity. In 1978, MSU divested the stocks of companies doing business in apartheid-governed South Africa from its endowment portfolio.|$|E

[...] John Moores (baseball), founder of the <b>River</b> <b>Blindness</b> Foundation, paid for the casts, which were intended to be given as gifts to major donors to the foundation. The foundation eventually partnered with the Carter Center, which asked for another edition of small sculptures to give to donors who contributed $1 million or more to the effort to eradicate the disease. [...] With the World Bank and other organisations, they led the programs to distribute the drug Ivermectin (Mectizan) which had been developed and donated by Merck and Co.|$|E

50|$|Duke {{attended}} Gonville and Caius college Cambridge {{and later}} Guy's Hospital, in all he attained an MD, MA, ScD, MB, BChir and a diploma in Tropical medicine.

He wrote 172 medical papers and his research set new standards in methodology for all future clinical trials.In 1975 Duke joined WHO as head of Filariasis infectious unit, his earlier research enabling the clinical trials of Ivermectin to go smoothly. This anti-parasitic drug proved very effective against <b>River</b> <b>Blindness</b> and other diseases caused by parasitic worms. Duke is also credited with pressuring Merck to supply Invermectin free to all sufferers of <b>River</b> <b>Blindness,</b> which {{led to the creation of}} the Mectizan Donation Programme.
