In the past various studies have been carried out on natural fiber composites [2]. Natural fibers are based on renewable materials and depending upon the source can be subdivided mainly into two major groups: plant fibers (based on agricultural resources) and animal fibers (based on resources derived from animals). The group of plant fibers can be subdivided into several classes: straw, seed, bast, leaf and wood fibers as depicted in Fig. 1.

3000|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the effect of root <b>reinforcement</b> <b>on</b> slope stability using finite element methods. It is well recognised that plant roots can improve the shear strength of soils by their high tensile strength and closely spaced root matrix system. The increase in soil shear strength due to root reinforcement is considered as an increase in apparent soil cohesion, called root cohesion, c [...] r [...]. In this paper, a freely available ([URL] finite element code called slope 64 described by Griffiths and Lane (Géotechnique 49 (3): 387 – 403, 1999) is used to model the effect of root <b>reinforcement</b> <b>on</b> slope stability. The root cohesion is added directly to the soil cohesion for the soil elements that are reinforced by plant roots. The results from the finite element analyses demonstrate that the factor of safety of a slope increases when the effect of root reinforcement is taken into consideration. A series of stability charts are developed {{which can be used}} for assessing the influence of root <b>reinforcement</b> <b>on</b> slope stability.|$|R

The reinforcement materials used was plastic cells which were made from standard extruded polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheet. The plastic cells were positioned at the middle height and at the upper side close {{to the surface of the}} CBEMs samples. The samples were subjected to dynamic cylindrical loading, where the number of dynamic load applied and the deformation were electronically recorded. Stress and strain distribution was analyzed using BISAR 3. 0 software from Shell company. It was found that the suitable position of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>on</b> CBEMs is on the upper side (close to the surface), which gives significant prevention on deformation and crack during early age of CBEMs...|$|R
40|$|Unfavourable {{environmental}} conditions {{associated with an}} insufficient stability margin adopted in the design process may determine ship capsizing.

During the seakeeping model tests <b>on</b> <b>longitudinal</b> waves, the occurrence of induced roll motions were observed and measured. The restoring moment <b>on</b> <b>longitudinal</b> waves was determined based on theoretical and experimental methods. A computer code has been implemented in order to calculate the main parts of the restoring moment i. e. Froude-Krylov, diffraction and radiation components. In order to reproduce the real physical phenomenon, captive and semi-captive model tests were correlated. The radiation and diffraction forces and moments and the restoring moment <b>on</b> regular <b>longitudinal</b> waves were measured. The agreement of the calculated solutions with the experimental results indicates the possibility of using the adopted hydrodynamic model in the design process...|$|R
