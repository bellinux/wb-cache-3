5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's <b>rarely</b> <b>a</b> viable option in a custody case.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, Labradors will exhibit {{small amounts}} of white fur on their chest, paws, or tail, and <b>rarely</b> <b>a</b> {{purebred}} Lab will exhibit brindling stripes or tan points similar to a Rottweiler. These markings are a disqualification for show dogs but {{do not have any}} bearing on the dog's temperament or ability to be a good working or pet dog.|$|E

5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic {{transparency}} and very low distortion. Its midrange performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and transient response very fast. A properly configured stereo pair would generate {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the sound stage snaps into focus. This led to criticisms of the speaker's directionality which in practice was <b>rarely</b> <b>a</b> problem and {{had the benefit of}} reducing the effects of room resonances.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or <b>rarely</b> <b>a</b> partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E
5|$|Males {{entering}} {{their second}} or third year may develop spotty blue and white plumage during the breeding season. By their fourth year, males have assumed their nuptial plumage, where the scapulars, secondary wing coverts, and secondary flight feathers are white {{while the rest of}} their bodies are a vibrant cobalt blue. All sexually mature males moult twice a year, once before the breeding season in winter or spring, and again afterwards in autumn; <b>rarely,</b> <b>a</b> male may moult directly from nuptial to nuptial plumage. The breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{parasite}}s {{are known}} for this species, and both juveniles and adults often carry heavy parasite loads. Known internal parasites include the monogenean Squalonchocotyle spinacis, the tapeworms Aporhynchus norvegicus, Lacistorhynchus tenuis, and Phyllobothrium squali, and the nematodes Anisakis simplex and Hysterothylacium aduncum. Some of these parasites use the velvet belly's prey as intermediate hosts and are acquired via ingestion, while others use the shark itself as an intermediate host. The barnacle Anelasma squalicola, an external parasite, attaches to the shark's dorsal spine socket and penetrates deeply into the muscle, in the process often providing an attachment site for a second (and <b>rarely</b> <b>a</b> third) barnacle. Infestation by this barnacle reduces its host's fecundity by impairing {{the development of the}} reproductive organs.|$|E
5|$|The analog {{technique}} {{is a complex}} way of making a forecast, requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event {{that is expected to}} be mimicked by an upcoming event. What makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is <b>rarely</b> <b>a</b> perfect analog for an event in the future. Some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition. It remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans, as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future. A similar {{technique is}} used in medium range forecasting, which is known as teleconnections, when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime. An example of teleconnections are by using El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The sharptooth houndshark is a stout-bodied {{species with}} a short, thick, and blunt snout. The {{nostrils}} are widely spaced and preceded by lobe-like flaps of skin {{that do not}} reach the mouth. The horizontally oval eyes have ridges underneath and are equipped with nictitating membranes. The large mouth bears long, deep furrows at the corners, with those on the lower jaw almost meeting in the middle. The teeth are small and tightly packed to form pavement-like surfaces. Each tooth has a rounded, molar-like base that rises to a sharp, upright central cusp; <b>rarely,</b> <b>a</b> pair of barely developed lateral cusplets may also be present. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
50|$|Device {{trees are}} used by {{operating}} system software, particularly operating system kernels. Boot loaders can pass a device tree structure stored in flash (common) or one might be generated at boot time (<b>rarely).</b> <b>As</b> an example, Das U-Boot and kexec include support for device trees. Alternatively, device trees can be built into software such as the Linux kernel to handle cases where the boot loader is not device tree aware.|$|R

5|$|Georgia Tech {{football}} was Atlanta's one major sports franchise {{during this time}} frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at a card table on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as on a Saturday in Athens when Georgia Tech {{was about to be}} upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; <b>rarely</b> <b>a</b> classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Netherlandish masters borrowed many customs from 13th- and 14th-century Italian altarpieces. The conventions for Italian triptychs before 1400 were quite rigid. In central panels the mid-ground was populated {{by members of the}} Holy Family; early works, especially from the Sienese or Florentine traditions, were overwhelmingly characterised by images of the enthroned Virgin set against a gilded background. The wings usually contain a variety of angels, donors and saints, but there is never direct eye contact, and only <b>rarely</b> <b>a</b> narrative connection, with the central panel's figures. Netherlandish painters adapted many of these conventions, but subverted them almost from the start. Van der Weyden was especially innovative, as apparent in his 1442–45 Miraflores Altarpiece and c.1452 Braque Triptych. In these paintings members of the Holy Family appear on the wings instead of just the central panels, while the latter is notable for the continuous landscape connecting the three inner panels. From the 1490s Hieronymus Bosch painted at least 16 triptychs, the best of which subverted existing conventions. Bosch's work continued the move towards secularism and emphasised landscape. Bosch also unified the scenes of the inner panels.|$|E

50|$|The usual {{checks and}} {{balances}} on an executive president are through the judicial system through statutory authorisations or prohibitions and by some legislative body or bodies (e.g., congress, parliament, senate). <b>Rarely,</b> <b>an</b> executive president has some powers that are unchecked, {{which can lead to}} abuses.|$|R
5000|$|Nature and {{ancestor}} {{spirits are}} common in popular Taoism, but this sort of shamanism is eschewed for an emphasis on internal alchemy among the [...] "elite" [...] Taoists.
