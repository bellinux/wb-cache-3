40|$|A {{computer}} simulation of North American end-Pleistocene human and large herbivore population dynamics correctly predicts the extinction or survival of 32 out of 41 prey species. Slow human population growth rates, <b>random</b> <b>hunting,</b> and low maximum hunting effort are assumed; additional parameters {{are based on}} published values. Predictions are close to observed values for overall extinction rates, human population densities, game consumption rates, and the temporal overlap of humans and extinct species. Results are robust to variation in unconstrained parameters. This fully mechanistic model accounts for megafaunal extinction without invoking climate change and secondary ecological effects. More {{than half of the}} large mammal biota of the Americas disappeared in a cataclysmic extinction wave {{at the very end of}} the Pleis-tocene (1, 2).

40|$|There are, at least, three {{possible}} {{ways in which}} similar species coexist; resource partitioning, interference competition, and exploitation competition. Here, I investigated which way contributed to the coexistence of leafroller-hunting eumenid wasp species. Resource partitioning and, in addition, differential diet breadths proved to promote species coexistence in this case. First, I analyze the prey records and diet overlap of four eumenid species in a local area. The larger two eumenids hunted similar-sized prey items and had similar potential taxonomic prey uses. But the diet breadth of the subsocial eumenid was much wider {{than that of the}} solitary one. As a result, the diet overlap between the two large eumenids decreased. This was because the solitary eumenid attend repeatedly to the same hunting site inhabited by one abundant prey species, while the subsocial one made <b>random</b> <b>hunting.</b> On the other hand, the two medium-sized eumenids partitioned resources according to prey size. Secondly, I related these results to prey choice by several other species of eumenid obtained from literature sources. Ten Japanese common eumenids were divided into four groups according to their prey size. In each of the four groups, 2 to 3 wasp species differentiated the habitat (1 group) or coexisted by means of differential diet breadths (parallel with differential sociality, 2 groups). 自然界における近似種の共存様式としては，資源分割，干渉型の競争，および先取り型の競争などが知られている．メイガ科やハマキガ科などの葉巻蛾を狩るドロバチ類の共存様式について，資源分割とともに餌種選択幅の広狭が種の共存をゆるす要因になっていることが示唆された．まず，野外におけるドロバチ類 4 種の餌種構成，および餌種選択の重複度について 2 年間のデータから検討した．大型の 2 種のドロバチは餌サイズと餌の分類群のいずれにおいても潜在的な選好性は類似していたが，実際に狩ってくる餌種の構成は，亜社会性ドロバチが単独性ドロバチよりも多様であった．この原因は，単独性種が主選好の餌種を集中的に狩るのに対し，亜社会性種は，ランダム採餌を行なっていることによる．この結果，両種ドロバチの餌種の重複度は低下していた．一方，中型の 2 種のドロバチ同士は，餌サイズの選好性をちがえていた．次に，日本産の普通種のドロバチ 10 種について，餌サイズ，餌の分類群，ハチの社会性の程度などを文献資料も用いて比較検討した． 10 種は餌サイズの違いによって 4 つのグループに分れた．各グループ内の種同士を比較すると，生息場所が異なっている場合（ 1 グループ）とともに，生息、場所は類似しているが，餌種選択幅が異なり，かつ社会性の程度が異なっている場合（ 2 グループ）が認められた（残りの 1 グループの共存機構は不明）．以上より，社会性の程度の差が採餌戦略および餌選択幅の相違をうみ，ひいては種の共存をゆるす一つの機構となっている可能性が示唆された．...|$|E

5000|$|Michael Trcic (born 1960) is an American {{sculptor}} {{best known}} for his paleontological models of dinosaurs. He worked for many years as a special effects artist for films and television programs, {{and was one of the}} lead animators and puppeteers for the famous Tyrannosaurus rex model featured in Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park. He has also worked in television animation, including for Discovery Channel's 2002 documentary film When Dinosaurs Roamed America. For models and other artwork outside of special effects, Trcic commonly consults with paleontologists in order to achieve a high standard of accuracy for his work. His sculpture has been compared to that of Brian Cooley, but with a [...] "somewhat more traditional" [...] style. He has provided dinosaur sculpture work for a variety of media and institutions, including IMAX, The University of Chicago, The National Geographic Society, Disney, and the Arizona Museum of Natural History, where his life-sized bronze Dilophosaurus sculpture is featured. His statue of the sauropod dinosaur Jobaria can be viewed at the Navy Pier of Chicago, Illinois. Trcic's work has also been published in a variety of written media, including <b>Random</b> House's book <b>Hunting</b> Dinosaurs and the magazines Earth Magazine and Prehistoric Times.|$|R
40|$|Background The {{prognosis}} of {{gastric cancer}} {{is difficult to}} determine, although clinical indicators provide valuable evidence. Methods In this study, using screened biomarkers of gastric cancer in combination with <b>random</b> forest variable <b>hunting</b> and multivariable Cox regression, a risk score model was developed to predict the survival of gastric cancer. Survival difference between high/low-risk groups were compared. The relationship between risk score and other clinicopathological indicators was evaluated. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify pathways associated with risk scores. Results The patients with high risk scores (median overall survival: 20. 2 months, 95 % CI [16. 9 – 26. 0] months) tend to exhibit early events compared with those with low risk scores (median survival: 70. 0 months, 95 % CI [46. 9 – 101] months, p =  1. 80 e– 5). Further validation was implemented in another three independent datasets (GSE 15459, GSE 26253, GSE 62254). Correlation analyses between clinical observations and risk scores were performed, and {{the results indicated that}} the risk score was not significantly associated with gender, age and primary tumor size but was significantly associated with grade and tumor stage. In addition, the risk score was also not influenced by radiation therapy. Cox multivariate regression and three-year survival nomogram suggest that the risk score is an important indicator of gastric cancer prognosis. GSEA was used to identified KEGG pathways significantly associated with risk score, and signaling pathways involved in focal adhesion and the TGF-beta signaling pathway were identified. Conclusion The risk score model successfully predicted the survival of 1, 294 gastric cancer samples from four independent datasets and is among the most important indicators in clinical clinicopathological information for the prognosis of gastric cancer. To our knowledge, it is the first report to predict the survival of gastric cancer using optimized expression panel...|$|R
