40|$|In this thesis, <b>robot</b> {{navigation}} {{using the}} Particle Filter based FastSLAM approach for obstacle avoidance {{derived from a}} modified Velocity Potential Field method was investigated. A switching controller was developed to deal with <b>robot’s</b> efficient turning direction when close to obstacles. The determination of the efficient turning direction {{is based on the}} local map <b>robot</b> derived from its on board local sensing. The estimation of local map and <b>robot</b> path was implemented using the FastSLAM approach. A particle filter was utilized to obtain estimated <b>robot</b> path and obstacles (local map). When <b>robot</b> sensed only obstacles, the estimated <b>robot</b> positions was regarding to obstacles based the measurement of the distance between the <b>robot</b> and obstacles. When the <b>robot</b> detected the goal, estimation of <b>robot</b> path will switch to estimation with regard to the goal in order to obtain better estimated <b>robot</b> positions. Both simulation and experimental results illustrated that estimation with regard to the goal performs better than estimation regarding only to obstacles, because when <b>robot</b> travelled close to the goal, the residual error between estimated <b>robot</b> path and the ideal <b>robot</b> path becomes monotonously decreasing. When <b>robot</b> reached the goal, the estimated <b>robot</b> position and the ideal <b>robot</b> position converge. We investigated our proposed approach in two typical <b>robot</b> navigation scenarios. Simulations were accomplished using MATLAB, and experiments were conducted with the help of both MATLAB and LabVIEW. In simulations and experiments, the <b>robot</b> successfully chose efficiently turning direction to avoid obstacles and finally reached the goal...|$|R

5|$|Written by Robert Holmes and {{submitted}} to Story editor Donald Tosh on 25 April 1965. This four-part story idea involved the Doctor {{and his three}} companions arriving on an uninhabited planet to discover a space craft controlled by <b>robots</b> while its human occupants lie in suspended animation waiting for the additional crew members needed to once again operate their crashed ship. The Doctor and his companions are taken captive and trained up by the <b>robots</b> as the replacement crew members, however only three additional crew members are required, so the member of the Doctor's party that proves least useful is to be callously killed off by the human crew. This was Holmes first story submission for the series, and was primarily rejected due to the <b>robots</b> role being {{similar to that of}} the Mechanoids in The Chase from the previous season. Holmes would later resubmit this story idea to producer Peter Bryant on 20 May 1968 which led to the commissioning of what would become The Krotons.|$|E
