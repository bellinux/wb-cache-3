Based on {{our current}} {{expectation}} for the exascale systems, composed of hundred {{of thousands of}} many-core nodes, the {{mean time between failures}} will become small, even under the most optimistic as-sumptions. One of the most scalable checkpoint <b>restart</b> techniques, the <b>message</b> logging approach, is the most challenged when the number of cores per node increases, due to the high overhead of saving the message payload. Fortunately, for two processes on the same node, the failure probability is correlated, meaning that coordinated recovery is free. In this paper, we propose an intermediate approach that uses coordination between correlated processes, but retains the scalability advantage of message logging between independent ones. The algorithm still belongs to the family of event logging protocols, but eliminates the need for costly payload logging between coordinated processes. ...|$|R

In this article I will explore an amazing antimatter-mirror that I recently tumbled over in the files of quantitative finance. Garbage in, garbage out? One day when the market was very quiet, I got bored. As an option trader (and formula collector) what else could I do but play around with my Black-Scholes-Merton calculator (a computer implementation of the famous Black and Scholes (1973) / Merton (1973) Nobel Prize formula) ? Just for fun, I wondered {{what would happen if}} I dared to input negative volatility in the formula. My state-of-the-art self-made options system returned a negative number; at least I didn't get a “Catastrophic Error: <b>Restart</b> Immediately ” <b>message.</b> Options cannot take negative values, so I guess garbage in, garbage out. But wait, could there be something to it? By playing around with it a bit more I found, quite interestingly, that inputting negative volatility for a call option, then multiplying the result by negative one actually gave me the value of a put, and vice versa. Some time ago I had listened to Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman lecture on “Einstein's Relativity, Symmetry, and Space-Time, ” see Feynman (1997). The talk on symmetry, matter and antimatter had been particularly fascinating. Had Ijust looked into a financial parallel to matter and antimatter? Before we move on, allow me to shortly introduce you to the history behind the discovery of antimatter. Published on wilmott. com in January 2002 Serving th...|$|R
