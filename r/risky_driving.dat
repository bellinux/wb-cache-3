It is the third instalment in the Burnout series, which is characterised by fast-paced arcade racing. A staple of the series {{is the use of}} boost, earned through <b>risky</b> <b>driving,</b> to rapidly increase a car's speed. The central mechanic introduced in Burnout 3 is Takedowns, which allow players to slam their opponents until they crash. Takedowns work in conjunction with the boost system by filling up and extending the boost meter. Aside from standard circuit races, the game features modes focused on performing Takedowns on rival vehicles and causing monetary damage at a junction occupied with traffic. Each game variant is featured in a single-player campaign mode called World Tour, which serves as the primary method for unlocking new and faster cars. The game supports both online and split-screen multiplayer.|$|E

500|$|In March 2008, {{news reports}} {{indicated}} that the tables had been turned on Van der Eem, who himself was secretly taped after giving an interview for Aruban television. Van der Eem, {{under the impression that}} cameras had been turned off, disclosed that he had been a friend of Van der Sloot for years (contradicting his statement on the De Vries show that he had met Van der Sloot in 2007), that he expects to become a millionaire through his involvement in the Holloway case, and that he knew the person who supposedly disposed of Holloway's body—and that Van der Sloot had asked him for two thousand euros to buy the man's silence. According to Dutch news service ANP, Van der Eem, who had already signed a book deal, [...] "was furious" [...] after learning of the taping, and [...] "threatened" [...] the interviewer, who sought legal advice. Van der Eem's book Overboord (Overboard), co-written with E.E. Byars, was released (in Dutch) on June 25, 2008. Van der Eem was arrested on December 13, 2008, in the Netherlands for allegedly hitting his girlfriend with a crowbar and engaging in <b>risky</b> <b>driving</b> behavior while fleeing police.|$|E
40|$|According to some authors, highly {{self-conscious}} {{individuals are}} susceptible to performance breakdown {{in the presence of}} an evaluative audience (e. g., Maxwell, Masters, & Poolton, 2006), whereas other authors report less susceptibility (e. g., Baumeister, 1984). Previous studies have provided these contrasting results using discrete tasks. The aim of the current study was to ascertain whether self-consciousness is associated with changes to continuous task performance (simulated driving) in the presence and absence of an evaluative passenger, and to elucidate the direction of this relationship. Participants, classified as either high or low self-conscious (n = 14 in each group), performed seven 5 -minute trials on a driving simulator. The first six trials (Practice Phase) were performed alone, whereas, the final trial (Observation Phase) was performed whilst observed. During the Practice Phase high self-conscious drivers were recorded engaging in <b>riskier</b> <b>driving</b> behaviours, relative to low self-conscious drivers. During the Observation Phase, high self-conscious drivers still displayed <b>riskier</b> <b>driving</b> behaviours than did low self-conscious drivers despite both groups' attempts to control the speed of their vehicles. The results imply that high trait self-consciousness, rather than low, appears to be associated with poorer task performance under both evaluative and non-evaluative conditions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effect of a}} fear-based personality trait, as conceptualised in Gray’s revised reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) by the strength of the fight/flight/freeze system (FFFS), on young people’s driving simulator performance under induced psychosocial stress. Seventy-one young drivers completed the Jackson- 5 questionnaire of RST traits, followed by a psychosocial stress or relaxation induction procedure (random allocation to groups) and then a city driving simulator task. Some support was found for the hypothesis that higher FFFS sensitivity would result in poorer driving performance under stress, in terms of significantly poorer hazard responses, possibly due to an increased attentional focus on the aversive cues inherent in the stress induction leaving reduced attentional capacity for the driving task. These results suggest that stress may lead to <b>riskier</b> <b>driving</b> behaviour in individuals with fearful RST personality styles...|$|R
2500|$|According to an 80-year old {{and ongoing}} study started in 1921 by {{psychologist}} Lewis Terman on over 1,500 gifted adolescent Californians, [...] "The strongest predictor of long life was conscientiousness." [...] Specific behaviors associated with low conscientiousness may explain {{its influence on}} longevity. Nine different behaviors that are among the leading causes of mortality—alcohol use, disordered eating (including obesity), drug use, lack of exercise, risky sexual behavior, <b>risky</b> <b>driving,</b> tobacco use, suicide, and violence—are all predicted by low conscientiousness. Health behaviors are more strongly correlated with the conventionality rather than the impulse-control aspect of conscientiousness. Apparently, social norms influence many health-relevant behavior, such as healthy diet and exercise, not smoking and moderate drinking, and highly conscientious people adhere the most strongly to these norms. Additionally, conscientiousness is positively related to health behaviors such as regular visits to a doctor, checking smoke alarms, and adherence to medication regimens. Such behavior may better safeguard health and prevent disease.|$|E

Lower CFC scores have been shown to be associated with aggressive and <b>risky</b> <b>driving</b> behaviour, physically aggressive expression (e.g. shaking a fist at another driver), using one’s vehicle to express anger, and are shown to be negatively related to constructive expression (thinking the situation through before responding). Individuals with higher CFC report engaging in fewer aggressive and <b>risky</b> <b>driving</b> behaviours and are more likely to express driving-related anger in an appropriate manner.|$|E

40|$|Drivers under 25 {{years are}} {{over-represented}} in global road accident statistics. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) {{has been used}} to identify individuals who are likely to engage in behaviours, such as speeding, which are associated with increased accident involvement. In an attempt to investigate adolescents‟ attitudes and behaviours from pre- to post-driver training, the studies presented incorporate past behaviour into the TPB. Three questionnaire-based studies were conducted in Scotland and New Zealand. The first study explored adolescent pre-drivers‟ road behaviour, driving attitudes and speeding intentions. Adolescents‟ with the greatest speeding intentions frequently engaged in high-risk road behaviour and had more accepting attitudes towards driving violations. The second study explored the development of attitudes and intentions from pre- to post-driver training. Drivers who frequently violated reported more accepting attitudes towards violations and engagement in frequent high-risk road behaviours as pre-drivers. The third study assessed the stability of pre-drivers‟ driving attitudes and speeding intentions. Adolescents‟ attitudes and intentions fluctuated significantly; however, males reported <b>riskier</b> <b>driving</b> attitudes and greater speeding intentions. This research suggests that the role of road safety education and pre-driver interventions on future driving behaviour has been under-estimated.

Two groups of women (aged 18 - 23 and 45 - 50 years) participating in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health, completed a mailed questionnaire on driver behaviour and road accidents. Self reported accident rates in the last 3 years were 1. 87 per 100 000 km for the young drivers (n = 1199) and 0. 59 per 100 000 km for the mid-age drivers (n = 1564); most accidents involved damage only, not injury. Mean scores for lapses obtained using the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire, were similar in the two age groups and similar to those found in other studies. In contrast, scores for errors and violations for the young women were higher than for the mid-age group and previous reports using the same instruments. <b>Riskier</b> <b>driving</b> behaviour among young women was associated with stress and habitual alcohol consumption.

40|$|Driving while sleepy is {{regarded}} as a substantial crash risk factor. Reducing the risk of sleep-related crashes predominately rests with the driver’s awareness of experiencing signs that are common when sleepy; such as yawning, frequent eye blinks, and difficulty keeping eyes open. However the relationship between the signs of sleepiness and <b>risky</b> sleepy <b>driving</b> behaviours is largely unknown. The current study sought to examine the relationships between drivers’ experiences of the signs of sleepiness, <b>risky</b> sleepy <b>driving</b> behaviours, and the associations with demographic, work and sleep-related factors. In total 1, 608 participants completed a questionnaire administered via a telephone interview that assessed their experiences and behaviours of driving while sleepy. The results revealed a number of demographic, work and sleep-related factors were associated with experiencing signs of sleepiness when driving. Signs of sleepiness were also found to mediate the relationship between continuing to drive while sleepy and having a sleep-related close call event. A subgroup analysis based on age (under 30 and 30 years or older) found younger drivers were more likely to continue to drive when sleepy despite experiencing more signs of sleepiness. The results suggest participants had considerable experience with the signs of sleepiness and driving while sleepy. Actions to be taken from this research include informing the content of driver education campaigns regarding the importance of the signs of sleepiness. Working together to educate all drivers about the dangerousness of driving when experiencing signs of sleepiness is an important road safety outcome...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 The {{symptoms}} of a concussion include difficulties with balance, concentration, ocular-motor function and sensory integration. Concussions are common among young people given their exposure to sports and risky behavior. Driving safely can pose challenges for healthy teens and young drivers who are learning new skills. Young drivers {{are at greater risk}} of crash compared with experienced drivers. Drivers under 19 years of age are three times as likely to be in a fatal motor vehicle crash compared with drivers who were 20 years or older. The impact of recent concussion on driving ability has not been well studied. This prospective cohort study examined the impact of concussion on young drivers between 16 and 25 years of age. Case and control participants were evaluated by cognitive testing, survey response, and simulated driving. Case participants performed study tasks within two weeks of injury, and again after four to six weeks of recovery. Control participants were young drivers in the same age group who had no recent history of concussion, and performed the same tasks as case participants. At baseline, drivers with recent concussion had more difficulty engaging in a secondary task while driving at the baseline visit, but did not have the same difficulty in comparison to control participants at the follow-up drive. Significant differences were observed in performance using a tactile detection response task (TDRT) during simulated driving. The concussion group showed slightly <b>riskier</b> <b>driving</b> behavior, reaching higher speeds, rates of acceleration, and allowing less time-to-collision. The data from this study suggest the need for additional studies to examine the association between concussion and real-world driving risk...|$|R

This series of two studies employed multivariate statistical models to examine associations between self-report and objective measures in two samples of young drivers. Study 1 (n= 151) compared scores on the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory (MDSI), a self-report questionnaire tapping four broad driving styles, with the naturalistic driving recorded by an in-vehicle data recorder (IVDR). Study 2 (n= 80) compared responses to the Reckless Driving Habits Scale, assessing the frequency with which drivers commit a set of <b>risky</b> behaviors, with <b>driving</b> measures collected by a simulator. This study also examined the personality trait of sensation seeking, as well as gender and driving experience. In Study 1, the analysis revealed positive associations between high scores on the <b>risky</b> and hostile <b>driving</b> styles measured by the MDSI and risky behaviors measured by the IVDR, as well as inverse correlations between the latter and high MDSI scores on the anxious and careful driving styles. Similarly, in Study 2 associations were found between the self-reported frequency of reckless driving habits and several risky behaviors measured by the driving simulator. In addition, risky behaviors correlated with the sociodemographic variables and sensation seeking. The two studies, therefore, show that self-report measures are reliable tools for assessing driving behaviors for purposes of research, evaluation, and intervention...|$|R

50|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} factors that go into determining the underwriting risk on motorized vehicles are: performance capability and retail cost. The most commonly available providers of auto insurance have underwriting restrictions against vehicles that are either designed to be capable of higher speeds and performance levels, or vehicles that retail above a certain dollar amount. Vehicles that are commonly considered luxury automobiles usually carry more expensive physical damage premiums because they are more expensive to replace. Vehicles that can be classified as high performance autos will carry higher premiums generally because there is greater opportunity for <b>risky</b> <b>driving</b> behavior. Motorcycle insurance may carry lower property-damage premiums because the risk of damage to other vehicles is minimal, yet have higher liability or personal-injury premiums, because motorcycle riders face different physical risks while on the road. Risk classification on automobiles also takes into account the statistical analysis of reported theft, accidents, and mechanical malfunction on every given year, make, and model of auto.|$|E
