40|$|Abstract — A {{low-temperature}} amorphous-silicon (a-Si:H) thin-film-transistor (TFT) backplane {{technology for}} high-information-content flexible displays has been developed. Backplanes were integrated with frontplane technologies to produce high-performance active-matrix <b>reflective</b> electrophoretic <b>ink,</b> <b>reflective</b> cholesteric liquid crystal and emissive OLED flexible-display tech-nology demonstrators (TDs). Backplanes up to 4 in. on the diagonal have been fabricated on a 6 -in. wafer-scale pilot line. The {{critical steps in}} the evolution of backplane technology, from quali-fication of baseline low-temperature (180 °C) a-Si:H process on the 6 -in. line with rigid substrates, to transferring the process to flexible plastic and flexible stainless-steel substrates, to form factor scale-up of the TFT arrays, and finally manufacturing scale-up to a Gen 2 (370 × 470 mm) dis-play-scale pilot line, will be reviewed...|$|R
40|$|As mobile {{technology}} becomes a more {{integral part of}} our everyday lives, understanding the impact of different displays on perceived ease of use and overall performance is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we evaluate three mobile displays: the MicroOptical SV- 3, the Sony Librie, and the OQO Model 01. These displays each use different underlying technologies and offer unique features which could impact mobile use. The OQO is a hand-held device that utilizes a traditional transflective liquid crystal display (LCD). The MicroOptical SV- 3 is a head-mounted display that uses a miniature LCD and offers hands free use. Finally, the Librie uses a novel, low power <b>reflective</b> electronic <b>ink</b> technology. We present a controlled 15 -participant evaluation to assess the effectiveness of using these displays for reading while in motion...|$|R
50|$|Tattoo removal is most {{commonly}} performed using lasers that {{break down the}} ink particles in the tattoo. The broken-down ink is then fought off by the immune system, mimicking the natural fading that time or sun exposure would create. All tattoo pigments have specific light absorption spectra. A tattoo laser must be capable of emitting adequate energy within the given absorption spectrum of the pigment to provide an effective treatment. Certain tattoo pigments, such as yellows and fluorescent inks are more challenging to treat than darker blacks and blues, because they have absorption spectra that fall outside or {{on the edge of}} the emission spectra available in the tattoo removal laser. Recent pastel coloured inks contain high concentrations of titanium dioxide which is highly <b>reflective.</b> Consequently, such <b>inks</b> are difficult to remove since they reflect a significant amount of the incident light energy out of the skin.|$|R
