On June 30, 2017, she {{was appointed to}} the Order of Canada. Of the honor she said, [...] "I am a very, very proud Canadian, I am proud of where I am from, and to be recognized in this nature is surreal. It's not something you can dream about happening to you. I can dream of winning a World Cup or an Olympic gold medal, and that's my job, but to have your country <b>recognize</b> <b>you</b> – I don't even know what to say." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Celebration" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a sleek dance-oriented track with influences of previous dance singles by Madonna from the early 90s such as, [...] "Vogue" [...] (1990) and [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] (1992). It consists of a pumping, house style music in it. Paul Oakenfold described the composition as [...] "lyrically classic Madonna with an edgy modern sound." [...] Influences of Europop are found in the song, but not to the extent of previous single, [...] "Hung Up" [...] (2005). According to a writer from the Los Angeles Times, the song has a highly energetic synth-pop groove while referencing 80s Madonna songs. The bridge is in a speak-sing format, where Madonna's voice, consisting of a little edge, declares that [...] "I [...] <b>recognize</b> <b>you</b> with your clothes on." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the harsh}} {{economic}} {{times of the}} early Depression, films and performers often featured an alienated, cynical, and socially dangerous comic style. As with political films, comedy softened {{with the election of}} FDR and the optimism of the New Deal. Characters in the pre-Code era frequently engaged in comedic duels of escalating sexual innuendo. In Employee's Entrance, a woman enters the office of a scoundrel boss who remarks, [...] "Oh, it's you — I didn't <b>recognize</b> <b>you</b> with all your clothes on." [...] Racial stereotypes were usually employed when ethnic characters appeared. Blacks in particular were usually the butt of the wisecrack, never the author. The most acknowledged black comedian was Stepin Fetchit, whose slow-witted comedic character was only meant to be successful in an unintentional manner, with himself as the punchline.Bogle, pg. 42.|$|E

He beat out Troy Tulowitzki by 2 points in the closest NL vote since the system was revised in 1980. Of all prior NL Rookies of the Year, only Pujols and Willie McCovey hit for higher batting averages in their rookie year. Braun was voted the 2007 NL Sporting News Rookie of the Year by 488 major league players and 30 managers. Braun also received the 2007 Players Choice NL Most Outstanding Rookie in a vote by his fellow major league players. [...] "When your peers <b>recognize</b> <b>you</b> with an award, that's great", he said. [...] "Those are the guys {{out there on the}} field with you, competing against you. Their opinion counts the most, for a player." [...] In voting for the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, Braun received two 10th-place votes and finished 24th overall.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{had already}} started work on the album with Williams, and during one of her breaks from recording, her manager Guy Oseary spoke to Timberlake, {{suggesting}} that it [...] "would be cool" [...] if he recorded some songs with her. Timberlake commented [...] "'That would be awesome,' but I thought, 'That'll never happen', [...] But it's a testament to Pharrell. He had already laid the groundwork {{where she was going}} with it. She played 'Candy Shop' for me, {{and a couple of other}} songs, and I thought, 'What a cool direction.' I thought she could essentially do the whole record with Pharrell if she wanted to, and I asked Tim, 'How do we fit in?' And it basically came down to how we did my record, co-producing, and just throwing Madonna in the mix." [...] The first track recorded by Madonna and Timberlake was [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You". Timberlake felt that the song, which Madonna had been working on for years before the Hard Candy project, was comparable to [...] "Frozen" [...] (1998). He wanted to turn the line [...] "'The devil wouldn't <b>recognize</b> <b>you,</b> but I do" [...] into a catchy hook and make it sound like a concept.|$|E
500|$|The Tom Cruise {{video is}} {{referred}} to specifically {{at the start of}} the Anonymous YouTube video posting, and is characterized as a [...] "propaganda video". The video utilizes a synthesized voice and shows floating cloud images using a time lapse method as the speaker addresses the leaders of Scientology directly: [...] "We shall proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form..." [...] The video goes on to state: [...] "We <b>recognize</b> <b>you</b> as serious opponents, and do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame. However, you will not prevail forever against the angry masses of the body politic. Your choice of methods, your hypocrisy, and the general artlessness of your organization have sounded its death knell. You have nowhere to hide because we are everywhere... We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us." [...] By January 25, 2008, only four days after its release, the video had been viewed 800,000 times, and by February 8, 2008 had been viewed over 2million times. Author Warren Ellis called the video [...] "creepy in and of itself" [...] and a [...] "manifesto, declaration of war, sharp political film".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed in Milan, Italy between {{the dates of}} the 2009 leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. The concept of the video is in {{similarity}} to {{the title of the}} song; celebration of Madonna's career. According to MTV, the video is a throwback to Madonna's Erotica era and encompasses a dark music image. The Benny Benassi remix of the song is used in the video. It starts with Madonna asking the line [...] "Haven't I seen you somewhere before?". The music starts and the scenes cut between Madonna and her dancers start dancing to the music of the song. Madonna wears a crystal embossed, shouldered Balmain dress with knee-high Christian Louboutin boots. While she is present in almost every frame of the camera, she does not perform choreographed dance moves. Her dance is mostly confined to casual maneuvers. The dancers on the other hand, perform choreographed moves as a solo act. As the song progresses, more dancers are shown and they ultimately reach a club. The DJ in the club is portrayed by model Jesus Luz. Madonna indulges in sensual poses with him and removes his clothes in an attempt to recognize him, as the line [...] "I guess I don't <b>recognize</b> <b>you</b> with your clothes on" [...] is played. The two of them brush their lips together, and Madonna moves away to the dance floor again. Lourdes makes an appearance {{near the end of the}} video. She appears in an eighties styled, polka-dotted leotard and pants, and does a back arch on the ground. Madonna is then shown on the ground on all fours, or dancing while grabbing her groin. Both Madonna's and her dancer's moves are edited to appear in fast forward. Hip hop styled dancing is showcased towards the end of the video. [...] The end shot of the video portrays Madonna sliding down on the ground. Teaser trailers for the video, show Oakenfold dancing to the song, but his scenes are not included in the final version.|$|E
2500|$|Marxist {{dissident}} Alexandru Ivasiuc portrayed Răutu (as [...] "Valeriu Trotușeanu") in {{the novel}} Cunoaștere de noapte ("Nightly Knowledge"): the fictional cat-like Răutu spins a web of arguments, admitting his minor errors to divert focus from his crimes. Critic Nicolae Dragoș, {{who was in the}} process of moving from Stalinism to nationalism, made a point of saluting Ivasiuc's book: his own editorial for the review România Literară carried the unsettling title Te recunosc, domnule Trotușeanu ("I <b>Recognize</b> <b>You,</b> Mr. Trotușeanu"). A more nationalistic indictment of 1950s policies is found in Dinu Săraru's novel Dragostea și revoluția ("Love and Revolution"), where the antagonist, a politico by the name of [...] "Anghel Tocsobie", is probably based on Răutu. Presumably, the national communists allowed such works to see print because they helped remind Răutu that he was always under their scrutiny.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the debacle}} of the Katt affair in 1730, the Crown Prince lived in virtual house arrest in Rheinsberg; by 1733, after visiting his {{recalcitrant}} son, Frederick William eased {{the restrictions on}} the prince's life, and sent him on the Imperial military campaign in the Rhineland. Bredow was assigned by Frederick William I to teach the Crown Prince [...] "order and economy" [...] (Ordung und Haushaltung). [...] He was not only an [...] "observer", assigned to watch over the prince and report back to the king any problems, and presumably to report back to the king, Bredow developed a good mentoring relationship with Frederick. He stayed with the Crown Prince from early 1734 through December, when Frederick returned to Berlin. Bredow traveled between the front, Berlin, and Bayreuth several times. In February of that year, Frederick wrote to his sister: [...] "Captain Bredow has scared us all so much, especially me, {{when he said he}} found you so altered he did not <b>recognize</b> <b>you</b> and that you would not eat anything." ...|$|E
