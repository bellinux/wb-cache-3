5|$|Working for Clair Brothers, Jackson toured with Elvis Presley, mixing {{monitors}} while independent engineer Bill Porter mixed {{front of}} house (FOH) for the audience. Clair Brothers supplied all the audio gear; Jackson designed a powerful stage monitor system for Presley's show. To make {{more room for}} audience seating, he also used a sound reinforcement system that was not mounted on scaffolding but hung with steel chain above the audience from overhead beams, using chain hoists rigged upside down to raise the loudspeakers from the floorâ€”a now-common method used by licensed <b>riggers.</b> Jackson {{has said that he}} made a number of concert recordings during this period, all unreleased.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1930s, No.1 AD {{comprised}} 350 staff; {{the overall}} {{strength of the}} RAAF at this time was under 2,000. The depot serviced a range of aircraft that included the Westland Wapiti, Bristol Bulldog, Hawker Demon, de Havilland Dragon Rapide, Avro Cadet, Avro Anson, and North American NA-16. The NA-16 was later augmented by {{the purchase of the}} more advanced North American NA-33, which was licensed and built in Australia by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation as the CAC Wirraway. To cope with the Government's decision to rapidly expand the RAAF, a Recruit Training Section, incorporating the nascent School of Armaments and Signals, was formed under the depot's auspices by Flight Lieutenant Charles Eaton on 1March 1935; it was reorganised as Recruit Training Squadron on 1September 1936. No.1 AD also commenced formal training courses for aircraft fitters and <b>riggers</b> in 1935, leading to the formation of No.1 School of Technical Training five years later.|$|E
5|$|From {{the first}} class of 14 June 1943, until the final class of 16 December 1944, more than 7,000 {{recruits}} were indoctrinated at the Palm Beach station. Approximately, 70 percent of the enlisted women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. Yeoman and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many SPARS were given the opportunity for training in other fields. Some attended other Navy schools and were trained as motion picture sound technicians, link trainer operators, parachute <b>riggers,</b> and air control operators. Others attended USCG schools and learned to be: cooks, bakers, radioman, pharmacist mates, radio technicians, and motor vehicle drivers. In January 1945, the training of enlisted personnel was transferred from Palm Beach to Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York, the largest USCG training station for men.|$|E

5|$|Ninety {{percent of}} the animation-related work was done in Hyderabad; the {{remaining}} ten percent was completed in the United States. In an Indo-Asian News Service interview, Draper said he collaborated with thirteen experts and a large team of animators to design the fly. Because the film's fly's eyes comprise 80 percent of its face, Rajamouli felt they could make it expressive; he used the 1986 Pixar American short film Luxo Jr. for inspiration. The output of the first team of animators, using the reference material prepared, was unsatisfactory and Rajamouli reworked the fly's detailing. Using a powerful lens, the film team conducted an arduous photographic shoot of unconscious flies in a bottle stored in a refrigerator. After enlarging the details, Rajamouli made cosmetic changes to the fly's face {{to make it look}} appealing onscreen. A new team including Draper, three concept artists, three modellers, two shader designers, two hair and fur designers, three <b>riggers</b> and several animators, designed the animated fly in two months. Its head and fur were designed after shaping its body and wings. The fly was refined daily using clay models to expedite the process. The animators found the sequences between Sudeep and the fly much more difficult to execute because the latter had to express emotions only though its slender arms rather than its face.|$|E

25|$|Most {{parachuting}} {{equipment is}} ruggedly designed and is enjoyed by several owners before being retired. Purchasers are always advised {{to have any}} potential purchases examined by a qualified parachute rigger. A rigger is trained to spot signs of damage or misuse. <b>Riggers</b> also keep track of industry product and safety bulletins, and can, therefore, determine if {{a piece of equipment}} is up-to-date and serviceable.|$|E
25|$|In parachuting, a {{drop zone}} or DZ {{is the area}} above and around a {{location}} where a parachutist freefalls and expects to land. It is usually situated beside a small airport, often sharing the facility with other general aviation activities. There is generally a landing area designated for parachute landings. Drop zone staff includes the DZO (drop zone operator or owner), manifestors, pilots, instructors, coaches, cameramen, packers, <b>riggers</b> and other general staff.|$|E

25|$|Wages: There {{are four}} classes of stagehands. Head {{carpenters}} and electricians, {{who are in}} the top category, made about $1,600 a week. Most stagehands (<b>riggers,</b> winch-workers and operators) were in the lowest class, making about $1,200 a week. The union claimed that the proposed rule changes would cut workers salaries by 38 percent. The League offered different pay raises for different classes of workers, but the union argued these did not make up for the lost income.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{only nine}} trades {{were open to}} women; however, duties {{expanded}} as the war progressed and 69 trades became available. Among the many jobs carried out by WD personnel, they became clerks, telephone operators, drivers, fabric workers, hairdressers, hospital assistants, instrument mechanics, parachute <b>riggers,</b> photographers, air photo interpreters, intelligence officers, instructors, weather observers, pharmacists, wireless operators, and Service Police. RCAF regulations at the time precluded women who possessed flying licences from flight instructing or front-line duty.|$|E
25|$|<b>Riggers</b> jump in to {{machines}} {{to control them}} with their mind. While jumped in {{they feel like they}} are the machine, using the vehicle or drone's sensors to replace their own. This allows the rigger to control the machine at Matrix speeds and with greater precision. The downside is if the machine takes damage the rigger {{will have to deal with}} dangerous levels of biofeedback. Likewise the rigger may have to engage in cybercombat with other hackers that are attempting to hijack their devices.|$|E
5000|$|The U.S Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist badge was {{originally}} {{known as the}} U.S. Navy Certified Parachute <b>Rigger</b> badge and designed by American Insignia Company in 1942 for graduates of the U.S. Navy Parachute <b>Rigger</b> School. During WWII, despite being against uniform regulations it became common for U.S. Marine Corps paratroopers who were issued the silver U.S. Army Basic Parachutist badge to wear the gold Navy Certified Parachute <b>Rigger</b> badge because they believed the gold [...] "Rigger wings" [...] looked better on their uniform. This out of regulations wearing of the Parachute <b>Rigger</b> badge became so common that in July 1963 the Commander of United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Bruce F. Meyers sent a request to Chief of Naval Operations Admrial George W. Anderson Jr. via Marine Corps Commandant General David M. Shoup requesting to officially make the Navy Parachute <b>Rigger</b> badge the parachutist badge for the Navy and Marine Corps. The request was approved by Admiral Anderson on July 12, 1963 per BuPers Notice 1020. Since 1963, being {{a graduate of the}} U.S. Navy Parachute <b>Rigger</b> School is no longer a requirement to earn the badge.|$|R
50|$|A {{parachute}} <b>rigger</b> is {{a person}} who is trained or licensed to pack, maintain or repair parachutes.

25|$|Afterwards, {{the town}} became {{a home for}} leather making; a brick and tile works; a {{spinning}} cotton mill and the first power spinning mill and linen factories in Fife. The shipbuilding industry was also resurrected which, {{by the end of}} the century, had built 26 square <b>riggers</b> in total, one sloop and two ferries. Construction of a turnpike road from the Pettycur ferry to Cupar and beyond was submitted in 1790 which, while only being a piece to improve Fifeâ€™s isolated road system, also helped to strength Kirkcaldyâ€™s position in Fife.|$|E
25|$|Because of San Francisco's {{relative}} isolation, {{skilled workers}} could make demands that their counterparts on the East Coast could not. Printers first attempted to organize in 1850, teamsters, draymen, lightermen, <b>riggers</b> and stevedores in 1851, bakers and bricklayers in 1852, caulkers, carpenters, plasterers, brickmasons, blacksmiths and shipwrights in 1853 and musicians in 1856. Although these efforts required several starts to become stabilized, they did earn better pay {{and working conditions}} and began the long efforts of state labor legislation. Between 1850 and 1870, legislation made provisions for payment of wages, the mechanic's lien and the eight-hour workday.|$|E
25|$|The job {{training}} of women was so completely {{integrated with the}} entire AAF training program that virtually no separate statistics are available {{as a basis for}} comparing the record of the women with male trainees. Obviously, this policy meant that the Wacs had to be as well qualified as men to enroll in and graduate from a training course. It is known only that approximately 2,000 women completed courses in AAF technical schools, including those for Link-trainer instructors, airplane mechanics, sheet-metal workers, weather forecasters, weather observers, electrical specialists of several kinds, teletype operators, control-tower specialists, cryptographers, radio mechanics, parachute <b>riggers,</b> bombsight-maintenance specialists, clerks, photo-laboratory technicians, and photo-interpreters.|$|E
