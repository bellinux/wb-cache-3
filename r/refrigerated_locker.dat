5000|$|Next, Brown’s second success d'scandale, the [...] "Meat Show", {{was staged}} in 1964 {{in a large}} {{refrigerator}} unit at the Washington Meat Market….Brown became the first artist to stage a meat performance, renting [...] "tons of meat and gallons of blood" [...] and a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>locker</b> for a blood-spattered happening.|$|E
5000|$|Perutz {{proceeded}} to conduct experiments on {{the viability of}} pykrete and its optimum composition in a secret location underneath Smithfield Meat Market in the City of London. [...] The research {{took place in a}} <b>refrigerated</b> meat <b>locker</b> behind a protective screen of frozen animal carcasses.|$|R
50|$|Allsteel {{was founded}} in 1912 as Allsteelequip Company and started out {{manufacturing}} custom metal objects, especially electrical equipment. The name was changed in 1929 to All-Steel-Equip Company. In the 1920s, the company began to branch out and started producing kitchen cabinets and <b>refrigerated</b> food <b>lockers.</b> Requests for metal file cabinets were becoming common, so the company bought out a supplier, the Aurora Metal Cabinet Company, in 1936 to enter this market.|$|R
5000|$|Perlmutter's house {{also has}} a <b>refrigerated</b> food <b>locker</b> and a 4000-bottle wine cellar. Perlmutter is a gourmet cook, but also enjoys eating and {{drinking}} to excess and thus would qualify as a gourmand. Perhaps as a result, the six-foot-four inches tall Perlmutter weighs over 400 pounds. He {{is often described as}} wearing a paisley robe, and has a full beard and long, twisted mustache. [...] "Fritz", his pet dachshund puppy, also enjoys gourmet food.|$|R
5|$|During World War II, a large {{underground}} {{cold store}} at Smithfield was the theatre of secret experiments led by Dr Max Perutz on pykrete, {{a mixture of}} ice and woodpulp, believed to be possibly tougher than steel. Perutz's work, inspired by Geoffrey Pyke and part of Project Habakkuk, was meant to test the viability of pykrete as a material to construct floating airstrips in the Atlantic to allow refuelling of cargo planes in support of Admiral the Earl Mountbatten's operations. The experiments were carried out by Perutz and his colleagues in a <b>refrigerated</b> meat <b>locker</b> in a Smithfield Market butcher's basement, behind a protective screen of frozen animal carcasses. These experiments became obsolete {{with the development of}} longer range aircraft and the project was then abandoned.|$|R
5000|$|Gordon Holman, {{referring}} to the Landing Barge, Kitchen as an LCK, described it as having [...] "the appearance of a houseboat which somebody had attempted {{to turn into a}} factory. Chimneys, with square cowls on them, rose up {{from all parts of the}} vessel. But when the L.C.K. made smoke nobody complained.” The LBK was meant to be a floating kitchen. It had oil-fired ranges, automatic potato peelers, <b>refrigerated</b> meat <b>lockers,</b> four ovens in the aft end of its kitchen space, storage for bulk and perishable goods forward, and a 10-ton fresh water storage tank housed in the hold with additional fresh and sea water tanks above decks. It could hold sufficient provisions to feed 900 men for a week.|$|R
