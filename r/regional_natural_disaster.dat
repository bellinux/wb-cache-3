How to understand the risk of natural disaster and assess <b>regional</b> <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> is important. Natural disaster's risk assessment is often thought difficult and complicated. Based on risk theories, in this paper, elements of natural disaster risk are classified. According to this, we set a conceptual risk model for <b>regional</b> <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> which briefly separates assessment course into three procedures: hazard analysis; vulnerability assessment and risk assessment. And for each procedure, different techniques or mathematical models are suggested to adopt according to their different purposes which would make the assessment course feasible and reasonable. It is hoped that the study could be a metric for prioritizing strategies for regional disaster mitigation or planning...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for quantifying regional vulnerability to natural hazards in China. In recent decades, {{the study of}} vulnerability has gained a position of centrality in natural hazards research. How to quantitatively assess vulnerability has raised much interest in academia. Researchers have proposed {{a variety of methods}} for quantitative assessment. But these methods are very sensitive to weights set for subindices. As a result, analytic results are often less convincing. A model based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used for the assessment of regional vulnerability to natural hazards in an attempt to improve existing analytical methods. Using a <b>regional</b> <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> system framework, this article constructs an input-output DEA model for the assessment of regional vulnerability, and takes China’s mainland as a case study area. The result shows that the overall level of vulnerability to natural hazards in mainland China is high. The geographical pattern is that vulnerability is highest in western China, followed by diminishing vulnerability in central China, and lowest vulnerability levels in eastern China. There is a negative correlation between the level of regional vulnerability and level of regional economic development. Generally speaking, the more economically developed a region, the lower its regional vulnerability.|$|E

Examples of <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> include tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods, droughts, and other geologic pro-cesses. If they affect populated areas, <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> can cause eco-nomic damage, injuries, or even losses of lives.

By their pure nature, <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> are global phenomena that people refer to by different names, for example, the 2014 typhoon Rammasun 1 is known as typhoon Glenda in the Philippines.

The study identifies optimal locations for warehousing non-consumable inventories required for initial deployment of aid. These facility location problems are geometric optimizations using mean annual homeless resulting from hazards (atmospheric disruptions, floods, waves, landslides, seismic disruptions, volcanoes and wildfires) as an indirect estimation of demand for infrastructure inventory. Minimization of per capita distance, or the average global distance from the nearest warehouse to a forecasted homeless person, is advanced as the objective. An array of formulations, solved using mixed-integer linear programs, predict optimal facility configurations, and corresponding per capita distances, under incremental facility constraints; thereby measuring sensitivity of mean distance to facility proliferation. The problems are devised to also gather insights into maximal covering {{and the effects of}} initial conditions. (cont.) Moreover, demand patterns, along with correlated variables such as population and hazard frequency, offer views of <b>regional</b> vulnerability to <b>natural</b> <b>disasters.</b> The results also exhibit the absence of re-configuration, indicating that location decisions may not be impacted by the number of facilities planned. by Anup Roop Akkihal.

Purposive sample of 300 male and female bereaved students affected by <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> studying in 10 differ-ent schools has been selected for the present study. The students selected are subjected to counselling programme developed by the researcher called “Grief Healing Integration and Adaptation Programme”.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} explore the association between <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> and neighborhood change and further to examine the differential impact of <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> on neighborhood change according to the disaster itself, the rehabilitation efforts of local jurisdictions, and {{the characteristics of the}} affected neighborhoods. Using the longitudinal model, it examines the shifts in neighborhood change trajectory before and after <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> for three indicators (home values, poverty rate and racial diversity). The results find that <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> {{have a significant impact on}} the trend of neighborhood change, reducing variation in the indicators within neighborhood. Home values and racial diversity of neighborhoods are likely to immediately decrease after <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> but not to shift in subsequent rate of change,while poverty rates are likely to instantly increase in the aftermath of the disasters and to annually decline over time. This dissertation also explores the differential effects on neighborhood change according to intensity of <b>natural</b> <b>disaster,</b> neighborhoods? average income and the location. The results of the analyses are like the following: 1) the neighborhoods which the more intense disasters hit are more likely to experience the rapid decline in home values and an instant increase in their poverty rates than those which the less intense disaster hit. On the other hand, the more intense <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> are more likely to increase neighborhoods? racial diversity than the less intense <b>natural</b> <b>disasters,</b> while <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> themselves are likely to decrease it. 2) <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> might have the more adverse impacts on low- and high-income neighborhoods than moderate-income neighborhoods and that the impacts on low-income neighborhoods are most severe. More importantly, the adverse impacts in low-income neighborhoods might be long lasting. 3) neighborhoods in suburban areas, compared to neighborhoods in the central cities, are likely to decrease in their home values after <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> and to increase in their poverty rates. Finally, the findings of this dissertation confirms its main arguments that a <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> affects the trend of neighborhood change and intervenes in the path of change over time and that <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> differentially shift neighborhoods according to their characteristics. Further it suggests that these neighborhood changes, once accelerated by a <b>natural</b> <b>disaster,</b> further polarize residential populations on a metropolitan neighborhood scale. Ph. D...|$|R
