40|$|The National Policy on Solid Waste (NPSW) {{points to}} the Reverse Logistics (RL) as an {{instrument}} that enables actions and strategies that allow adequate management of Urban Solid Waste (USW) according to their guidelines. After {{more than five years}} of its publication, studies of RL in Brazil haven´t met the demands for defining procedures in the implementation of proper management of MSW in accordance with the NPSW. This class of waste is the result of post-consumer and it is relevant to clarify the relationship in their reverse processes in order to help the structuring and management of <b>reverse</b> <b>channels</b> that drive the waste to proper destination, in compliance with the law. Therefore, the objective of this research was to formalize, by means of theoretical study, the necessary processes, according to the literature research and legal guidelines, for the <b>reverse</b> <b>channels</b> through the proposal for a map of RL processes. For such, literature research, detailed reading of Law number 12. 305 (NPSW) and interviews with professionals working in the USW <b>reverse</b> <b>channels</b> were performed.

50|$|The {{redundancy}} {{allows the}} receiver to detect {{a limited number of}} errors that may occur anywhere in the message, and often to correct these errors without retransmission. FEC gives the receiver the ability to correct errors without needing a <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> to request retransmission of data, but at the cost of a fixed, higher forward channel bandwidth. FEC is therefore applied in situations where retransmissions are costly or impossible, such as one-way communication links and when transmitting to multiple receivers in multicast. FEC information is usually added to mass storage devices to enable recovery of corrupted data, and is widely used in modems.|$|E

In the <b>reverse</b> <b>channel,</b> it places attenuation to block or [...] "suppress" [...] any signal {{on the assumption that}} the signal is echo. Naturally, such a device is not perfect. There are cases where both ends are active, and other cases where one end replies faster than an echo suppressor can switch directions to keep the echo attenuated but allow the remote talker to reply without attenuation.|$|E

The TrailBlazer instead allowed any one of its 512 channels to be assigned to transfer data in either direction, a technique they termed [...] "adaptive duplex". The modem was designed to use most of the bandwidth in a single direction, with a relatively low speed <b>reverse</b> <b>channel.</b> The modems at the two ends of the connection would negotiate line turnarounds, reversing the directions of the high-speed and low-speed channels, based {{on the amount of}} data queued for transmission in each modem.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{extremely}} long {{propagation delay}} between interplanetary nodes poses {{challenges to the}} investigation of Store-and-forward Deep Space Autonomous Network (DSAN). Long propagation delay combined with scarcity of energy at the planetary wireless nodes and relays, introduces new dimensions to the congestion control challenge. In this paper, we take advantage of long propagation delay between nodes and propose a novel approach for congestion control. The long delayed channel can be utilized as a memory resource. Instead of dropping the packets {{due to lack of}} storage at the intermediate nodes such as satellite or a robotic spacecraft, they are transmitted back to the source. This significantly reduces packet loss, and lowers the per packet energy consumption. In addition, this method provides feedback on the congestion status of the relay node. Consequently, the source is able to dynamically control traffic flow in the source-relay channel until congestion is abated. Two proposed protocols, i. e., (i) <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> (without rate control) and (ii) <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> with rate control are investigated, and compared with a conventional protocol where no <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> is utilized. Extensive simulations are conducted which validate that the performance with <b>reverse</b> <b>channel,</b> especially <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> with rate control, far outweigh the conventional approach, in terms of energy consumption, and retransmission per successful packet.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a closed-loop supply chain with re-manufacturing consisting of retailers, manufacturers and third-party logistics service providers; all {{participating in the}} product recycling responsibilities. The effectiveness of methods {{that can be used}} to share responsibilities amongst these parties is quantified using different <b>reverse</b> <b>channels.</b> First, re-manufacturing models with three different <b>reverse</b> <b>channels</b> for retailer collection, manufacturer collection and third-party collection are developed using collection responsibility sharing. Next, by comparing these models with the case of no collection responsibility sharing, the effectiveness of responsibility sharing is analysed and quantified. The results for the three models support the following conclusions: (i) from the point of view of the retailer, third-party collection is always the worst choice; (ii) the choice between retailer collection and manufacturer collection depends on the cost parameter representing the resources required in performing the reverse collection tasks; (iii) from the point of view the manufacturer, when the value of the cost parameter is small, collection by manufacturer is the best choice; retailer collection will be best for high values of the cost parameter...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{investigation}} presented is the characterisation of the nonlinear cyclic behaviour of steel joints between I profile beams to hollow section columns with welded <b>reverse</b> <b>channel.</b> When compared with other steel shapes, tubular profiles show a privileged structural behaviour due {{to their ability to}} withstand axial loads, bending in several directions and torsion, besides considerable advantages in terms of maintenance and aesthetics. The welded <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> connection is a good solution since it allows for a bolted joint between I beam to hollow column. Furthermore, this type of joint detail has a reasonable construction cost, is easy to implement and possesses large ductility through the deformation of the web panel. In this paper a comparison is made between experimental and numerical finite element model results. The main focus will be on the results concerning the main components of the <b>reverse</b> <b>channel,</b> i. e. web face in bending, flanges panels in shear, compression and tension.

40|$|An {{asymmetric}} {{network is}} one {{in which there is a}} mismatch between the characteristics of the forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>channel.</b> Typically, the forward channel is capable of high transmission rates and the <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> has lesser bandwidth. Cable modem networks and satellite networks are some technologies that exhibit network asymmetry. TCP, due to its widespread acceptance, is also used in asymmetric networks. However, the <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> being a bottleneck causes many problems in the behavior of traditional TCP protocols. The TCP protocol is heavily dependent on ACKs. The variation in the ACK arrival rate, caused due to network asymmetry, results in slower initial window growth and burstiness on the forward channel. Existing approaches to improve the performance of TCP in asymmetric networks use techniques such as reduction in number of ACKs. However, these approaches do not take into consideration the high bandwidth availability in the forward direction for early ramp up of TCP window. [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Transmit antenna {{selection}} (TAS) in multiple-input-multiple output (MIMO) {{has several}} advantages, particularly in hardware-costly transmit schemes {{such as those}} requiring linearisation.

40|$|The {{economical}} {{and environmental}} benefits of product remanufacturing {{have been widely}} recognized in the literature and in practice. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} interaction between a manufacturer's <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> choice to collect postconsumer goods and the strategic product pricing decisions in the forward channel when retailing is competitive. To this end, we model a direct product collection system, in which the manufacturer collects used products directly from the consumers (e. g., print and copy cartridges) and an indirect product collection system, in which the retailers act as product return points (e. g., single-use cameras, cellular phones). We first examine how the allocation of product collection to retailers impacts their strategic behavior in the product market, and we discuss the economic trade-offs the manufacturer faces while choosing an optimal <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> structure. When a direct collection system is used, channel profits are driven by the impact of scale of returns on collection effort, whereas in the indirect <b>reverse</b> <b>channel,</b> supply chain profits are driven by the competitive interaction between the retailers.
