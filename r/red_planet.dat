By contrast, if k2 is less than one, F2−F1 is a positive number; the added inverse-cube force is repulsive, as observed in the green planet of Figures5 and 10, and in the <b>red</b> <b>planet</b> of Figures4 and 5.|$|E

50|$|Much {{of the low}} {{luminosity}} of a {{red dwarf}} falls in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum, with lower energy than the visible light in which the Sun peaks. As a result, photosynthesis on a <b>red</b> dwarf <b>planet</b> would require additional photons to achieve excitation potentials comparable to those needed in Earth photosynthesis for electron transfers, due to the lower average energy level of near-infrared photons compared to visible. Having {{to adapt to a}} far wider spectrum to gain the maximum amount of energy, foliage on a habitable <b>red</b> dwarf <b>planet</b> would probably appear black if viewed in visible light.|$|R

In addition, the opening lyric, [...] "fear and panic in the air" [...] may be {{a reference to}} Mars, in that the <b>red</b> <b>planet's</b> two moons are named Phobos and Deimos, who were the Greek gods of Fear and Panic. Such a connection would fit in with numerous references to Mars in the album.|$|R

40|$|From {{our home}} planet to distant neutron stars, this narrated {{videotape}} presents recent scientific visualizations of observation and simulation data. We {{begin with a}} dramatic journey over SC 99 host city Portland and its surroundings. Later explorations accompany the X- 33 aerospace plane on its first test flight, witness Mississippi River flooding, and follow global life over 22 months. New views of Mars reveal a basin that could swallow Mount Everest, while a simulation tests how rovers would navigate the <b>red</b> <b>planets</b> terrain. We conclude with the first-ever supercomputer model producing a black hole from two merging neutron stars.

25|$|The second series, The <b>Red</b> <b>Planet,</b> {{followed}} {{the adventures of}} the crew in their first attempt to reach and explore Mars.

Chilton took the name Whitaker from a copy of Whitaker's Almanack which was sitting on his desk.|$|E

Horizons closed permanently in 1999 after a few years of sporadic operation; construction began on Mission: Space shortly thereafter.

The pavilion, like others at Epcot, features a VIP lounge for HP employees called The <b>Red</b> <b>Planet</b> Room.|$|E
25|$|Chilton wrote three Journey Into Space novels, one {{for each}} of the three {{original}} series. The first novel, titled Journey Into Space, told the story of Journey to the Moon and was the first book that Chilton had written. It was published in hardback by Herbert Jenkins in 1954, followed by The <b>Red</b> <b>Planet</b> in 1956, and The World in Peril in 1960. Later they were published in paperback by Pan in 1958, 1960 and 1962 respectively.|$|E
25|$|David Jacobs's {{ability to}} play {{a wide variety of}} characters, each with his own {{distinctive}} voice, resulted in him playing 22 different characters during the course of Journey Into Space.

In episode 1 of The <b>Red</b> <b>Planet,</b> Jet is interviewed by a group of newspaper reporters, all of whom were played by Jacobs.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} in the CHZs of red dwarf stars, the extremely close distances to the stars cause tidal locking, {{an important factor in}} habitability. For a tidally locked planet, the sidereal day is as long as the orbital period, causing one side to permanently face the host star and the other side to face away. In the past, such tidal locking was thought to cause extreme heat on the star-facing side and bitter cold on the opposite side, making many <b>red</b> dwarf <b>planets</b> uninhabitable; however, three-dimensional climate models in 2013, showed that the side of a <b>red</b> dwarf <b>planet</b> facing the host star could have extensive cloud cover, increasing its bond albedo and reducing significantly temperature differences between the two sides.|$|R

25|$|Kilmer's first role in 2000 {{was in the}} big budget Warner Bros. {{box office}} {{disaster}} <b>Red</b> <b>Planet.</b> That same year, he had a supporting role in the film Pollock and hosted Saturday Night Live for the first time. In 2002, he starred in the thriller The Salton Sea, which was generally well-reviewed, but received only a limited release.
