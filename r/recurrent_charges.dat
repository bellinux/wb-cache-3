40|$|Retirement-village {{residents}} may be disadvantaged {{by current}} policy on eligibility for Commonwealth Rent Assistance, reports this paper examining potential inequities in rent assistance {{for older people}} across different types of housing. This report is concerned with policies on Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA) for older people living in retirement villages, manufactured home parks and caravan parks. There have been concerns that eligibility criteria for CRA may have become inequitable across these different forms of housing because of changes in costs and tenure arrangements over the last decade. The study was commissioned by the Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) to inform CRA policy development. It provides information on financial and tenure arrangements in {{the different types of}} residential setting, and on the socio-economic and financial circumstances of residents. The research involved: * a review of the literature; * a telephone survey of operators of a national random sample of the three forms of non-standard accommodation; and * a paper-based survey of residents in the village/park sample. The study found that since an earlier SPRC study carried out in 1998, increases in the level of entry contributions in retirement villages have outstripped the annual updating of the Extra Allowable Amount (EAA) threshold which acts as the primary criterion for eligibility for CRA. Only three per cent of retirement-village residents appeared to be eligible on these grounds. The EAA criterion does not apply to MHP and caravan park dwellers, but if it did a much higher proportion would be eligible. Even allowing for over-representation of for-profit (and therefore potentially higher cost) villages in the sample, over time the costs of retirement-village entry are taking residents out of eligibility for CRA. Retirement-village residents in particular are also subject to widely varying but often substantial deferred management or departure fees, as well as retention by management of a proportion of any capital gains. Most MHP residents, by contrast, would normally retain all or most of the purchase price and any capital growth on the value of their housing, although some would appear to face significant departure fees too. Caravan park residents are not normally subject to deferred management or departure fees. On the basis of these findings, {{there seems to be some}} justification for the view that retirement-village residents may be disadvantaged by current policy on eligibility for CRA compared to those in MHPs, especially when deferred management and departure fees are taken into account. Some retirement villages attract a higher income and higher asset clientele that puts them clearly out of eligibility for CRA, but for others their financial circumstances are similar to those of MHP residents who pay lower departure fees (if any) and mostly retain capital gain achieved on sales. MHP residents tend to pay significantly higher <b>recurrent</b> <b>charges</b> than do retirement-village residents, but this is often made up for by receipt of CRA. Better-off retirement-village residents were somewhat over-represented in the survey sample, but even amongst these many were ‘asset-rich’ but still ‘cash-poor’, especially once the costs of paying for additional and often essential services were met. Even this asset base was often undermined by deferred management fees, and there is a strong case for great transparency and consistency across the retirement village sector in the application of these fees.

40|$|We have {{proposed}} a simple one-dimensional model of internal particle dynamics. The model {{is based on the}} assumption that self-interaction can be represented by a nonlinear feedback and described by a quadratic <b>recurrent</b> map. <b>Charge</b> plays the role of a generalized dynamical variable and a feedback coupling parameter. The model suggests that charge and action quantization stem from the system's dissipative quality and from a hierarchy of supercycle orbits located between period-doubling bifurcations on the Feigenbaum tree. Among the numerical results, we have discovered a link between the quantum of action and the elementary charge. We also found that the fine structure constant can with a good accuracy be expressed exclusively through mathematical constants, including the Feigenbaum delta. We have introduced dimensionless numbers that describe the relative role of the internal particle dynamics when both internal and external dynamics are taken into consideration. We have found these numbers to be close to the electron, proton, and neutron g-factors known from the experiment. Comment: 11 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|The Northern Carnarvon Basin is {{the richest}} {{petroleum}} province in Australia. About 50 gas/condensate and oil fields, associated mainly with Jurassic source rocks, {{have been discovered}} in the sub-basins and on the Rankin Platform since 1964. The basin {{is located at the}} southern end of the North West Shelf of Australia. It can be mainly subdivided into the Exmouth, Barrow, Dampier and Beagle Sub-basins, the Rankin Platform and Exmouth Plateau. The sub-basins are rift-related grabens and half-grabens developed during the Jurassic to the earliest Cretaceous and contain over 10 kilometres of Mesozoic and Cainozoic sedimentary rocks, among which are several thousand meters of Jurassic rocks. The formations of the Jurassic and the lower part of the Barrow Group of Early Cretaceous age in the sub-basins of the Northern Carnarvon Basin were found to be overpressured with excess pressures of 5 - 29 MPa at depths of 2900 - 3600 m indicated by repeat formation tests (RFTs) and drill stem tests (DSTs). The characteristics of organic matter, thermal history and thermal maturity, pressure seal and overpressure evolution in the sub-basins are crucial to a proper understanding of the nature and dynamic processes of hydrocarbon generation and migration in the basin. Based on organic geochemical data, the important source rocks in the basin are Jurassic organic-rich fine-grained rocks including the Murat Siltstone, the rift-related Athol Formation and Dingo Claystone. The Mungaroo Formation of the Middle-Upper Triassic contains gas-generating source rocks. These formations recognised to be organic rich based on 1256 values of the total organic carbon content (TOC, %) from 17 wells. Average TOC values (calculated from samples with TOC 150 in some wells. Although the data reveal uncertainties and there is about ± 3 - 10 % error for thermal modelling by using the proposed relationship of Ro and Tmax, the "reliable" Tmax data are found to be important, and useful to assess thermal maturity and reduce the influence of unexpectedly low Ro data. This study analyzed the characteristics of deep overpressured zones and top pressure seals, in detail, in 7 wells based on the observed fluid pressure data and petrophysical data. The deep overpressured system (depth greater than 2650 - 3000 m) in the Jurassic formations and the lower part of the Barrow Group is shown by the measured fluid pressure data including RFTs, DSTs and mud weights. The highly overpressured Jurassic fine-grained rocks also exhibit well-log responses of high sonic transit times and low formation resistivities. The deep overpressured zone, however, may not necessarily be caused by anomalously high porosities due to undercompaction. The porosities in the deep overpressured Jurassic rocks may be significantly less than the well-log derived porosities, which may indicate that the sonic-log and resistivity-log also directly respond to the overpressuring in the deep overpressured fine-grained rocks of the sub-basins. Based on the profiles of fluid pressure and well-log data in 5 wells of the Barrow Sub-basin, a top pressure seal was interpreted to be consistent with the transitional pressure zone in the Barrow Sub-basin. This top pressure seal was observed to consist of a rock layer of 60 - 80 % claystone and siltstone. The depths of the rock layer range from 2650 m to 3300 m with thicknesses of 300 - 500 m and temperatures of 110 - 135 °C. Based on the well-log data, measured porosity and sandstone diagenesis, the rock layer seems to be well compacted and cemented with a porosity range of about 2 - 5 % and calculated permeabilities of about 10 - 19 to 10 - 22 M 2. This study performed thermal history and maturity modelling in 14 wells using the BasinMod 1 D software. It was found that the thermal maturity data in 4 wells are consistent with the maturity curves predicted by the rifting heat flow history associated with the tectonic regime of this basin. The maximum heat flows during the rift event of the Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous possibly ranged from 60 - 70 mW/m 2 along the sub-basins and 70 - 80 mW/m 2 on the southern and central Exmouth Plateau. This study also carried out two case studies of thermal maturity and thermal modelling within the deep overpressured system in the Barrow and Bambra wells of the Barrow Sub-basin. These case studies were aimed at understanding whether overpressure has a determinable influence on thermal maturation in this region. It was found that there is no evidence for overpressure-related retardation of thermal maturity in the deep overpressured system, based on the measured maturity, biomarker maturity parameters and 1 D thermal modelling. Therefore, based on the data analysed, overpressure is an insignificant factor in thermal maturity and h hydrocarbon generation in this basin. Three seismic lines in the Exmouth, Barrow and Dampier Sub-basins were selected and converted to depth cross-sections, and then 2 D geological models were created for overpressure evolution modelling. A major object of these 2 D geological models was to define the critical faults. A top pressure seal was also detected based on the 2 D model of the Barrow Sub-basin. Two-dimensional overpressure modelling was performed using the BasinMod 2 D software. The mathematical 2 D model takes into consideration compaction, fluid thermal expansion, pressure produced by hydrocarbon generation and quartz cementation. The sealed overpressured conditions can be modelled with fault sealing, bottom pressure seal (permeabilities of 10 - 23 to 10 - 25 M 2) and top pressure seal (permeabilities of 10 - 19 to 10 - 22 m 2). The modelling supports the development of a top pressure seal with quartz cementation. The 2 D modelling suggests the rapid sedimentation rates can cause compaction disequilibrium in the fine-grained rocks, which may be a mechanism for overpressure generation during the Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous. The data suggest that the present-day deep overpressure is not associated with the porosity anomaly due to compaction disequilibrium and that compaction may be much less important than <b>recurrent</b> pressure <b>charges</b> because most of the porosity in the Jurassic source rocks has been lost through compaction and deposition rates have been very slow since the beginning of the Cainozoic. Three simple 1 D models were developed and applied to estimate how rapidly the overpressure dissipates. The results suggest that the present day overpressure would be almost dissipated after 2 million years with a pressure seal with an average permeability of 10 - 22 M 2 (10 - 7 md). On the basis of numerous accumulations of oil and gas to be expelled from the overpressured Jurassic source rocks in the basin and the pressure seal modelling, it seems that the top pressure seal with permeabilities of 10 - 19 to 10 - 22 M 2 (10 - 4 to 10 - 7 md) is not enough to retain the deep overpressure for tens of millions of years without pressure recharging. Only if the permeabilities were 10 - 23 m 2 (10 - 8 md) or less, would a long-lived overpressured system be preserved. This study suggests that hydrocarbon generation, especially gas generation and thermal expansion, within sealed conditions of low-permeability is a likely major cause for maintaining the deep overpressure over the past tens of millions of years.
