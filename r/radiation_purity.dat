40|$|At {{the moment}} {{there are not}} {{problems}} of fundamental nature in CW proton linac construction with energy of 1 GeV and current of 30 mA. That is why the main problems have economic and technical aspects [1, 2]: high economic efficiency (total electric efficiency> 50 %), its reliability and <b>radiation</b> <b>purity,</b> linac design have to permit modernization with changing of beam performances demanded, linac design has to apply perspective methods and materials tested in actual practice. The most expedient way of obtaining of such proton beams is acceleration in linear accelerator with superconducting (SC) accelerating resonators. The scheme of CW proton and negative ion of hydrogen linear accelerator (LAP) with energy of 1 GeV and current up to 30 mA with superconducting accelerating resonators (SCR) in the main part is show...|$|E
40|$|The LIDOS. RFQ. Designer code package gives users the {{possibility}} to proceed successfully from input data up to RFQ channel design and space-charge-dominated beam simulation. The code main feature is a maximum of scientific visualization for each calculation step. The package contains codes with three levels of mathematical model complexity. The first-level codes make not only a preliminary choice of the main parameter arrays {{on the basis of}} a simplified physical model but also chosen design optimization. In the case of high-current CW RFQ <b>radiation</b> <b>purity</b> (minimum of lost particles) is considered as the main optimization criteria. The second-level codes are used for RF field calculations taking into account the real shape of the RFQ vanes. The third-level codes are based on complex PIC-models that are needed for beam simulation in the chosen channel version...|$|E

40|$|The {{second part}} of this two-piece paper applies the method {{developed}} in part 1 to show some interesting features for the practical analysis and design of leaky-wave antennas. Novel analytical formulas based o the propagation and radiation discrete Parallel-Plate Waveguide (PPW) spectrum coefficients described {{in the first part}} are presented, in order to calculate some interesting propagation and radiation aspects of leaky-wave modes. These formulas will be used in the design of a slot-line millimeter-wave band leaky-wave antenna, meassuring parameters such as reflection and <b>radiation</b> losses, polarization <b>purity,</b> and coupling with undesired channel-guide leaky modes. Comparisons with previus worksfor slot-line leaky-wave modes are presented, together with novel and interesting results, showing the usefulness of the proposed approach for the design of practical leaky-wave laterally shielded planar printed antennas...|$|R
40|$|Thermoluminescence (TL) {{studies of}} insulators, {{including}} crystals of minerals uch as calcite, quartz or zircon, {{have resulted in}} the development of a wider range of applications in the fields of radiation dosimetry and archaeological and geological dating. Most conventional TL measurements are made by recording light emission during heating by means of broad-band optical filters and blue-sensitive photomultiplier tubes. Much more information may be gained by monitoring the details of the emission spectrum during thermoluminescence. TL spectra of minerals exhibit changes as a result of crystal <b>purity,</b> <b>radiation</b> dose, dose rate and thermal history. This paper exemplifies the additional information available as a result of spectral studies, and focuses on investigations undertaken by the University of Sussex TL group. Examples include work on calcite, fluorite, zircon and feldspars...|$|R

40|$|Microwave {{generators}} {{are used}} in medical and scientific applications for heating or generating nonthermal effects. Such generators require fine output power and phase control {{to be able to}} control the focalization of the microwaves in the samples. They must also be able to generate continuous or pulsed microwave <b>radiation.</b> The spectral <b>purity</b> of the microwave output signal is usually not important as long as the generator will not produce large second- and third-order harmon-ics. Basically, all the energy in the microwave radiation spectrum contributes to the heating process. The micro-waves are radiated into the sample through different con-figuration applicators using the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency bands. A large range of power control is necessary if both thermal and nonthermal microwave effects are sought to be induced alternately during the treatment period. Such generators are rathe...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{contains}} {{the most valuable}} results of experimental and theoretical investigations of dual frequency circularly polarized microstrip antenna array for smart antenna applications with adaptive space-time processing capability. Geometry of the proposed antenna array was optimized for the operation in two frequency bands located inside IEEE L band. Presented array structure is composed from ten microstrip radiators independently excited via separate coaxial input ports. Two central radiating elements for two frequency bands have circular shapes with slits and are stacked to provide compact sizes and convergence of their phase centers. Peripheral radiators have annular ring with slits topology. Their geometric centers are superposed with the corners of virtual quadrats with the sides equal to the half of the wavelength for the appropriate band to eliminate the appearance of grating lobes and additional nulls in equivalent radiation patterns. The main feature of the array is its compact packaging that causes significant levels of electromagnetic mutual coupling. Last influences and noticeably deteriorates the shapes of <b>radiation</b> patterns, <b>purity</b> of polarization characteristics and reflection characteristics of planar radiators. The geometric parameters of presented array were selected via multi parametric particle swarm optimization method to provide optimum performance of each radiator in compact array packaging. Moreover, several circularly polarized radiators of the described array assembly were rotated around their centers to improve their characteristics and to increase the quality and effectiveness of latter space-time processing of adaptive antenna system. Novel design of the dual frequency circularly polarized array and imperfectness of obtained characteristics are experimentally validated...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. An easier way to perform a complete radionuclide analysis was investigated for this thesis. Complex chemical separations are not always possible or practical in preparation for counting a sample, especially a very small sample, on several different systems. Carrying out complex procedures may offer many opportunities for errors to be introduced into the analysis. Using the same sample and the same geometry, a technique was devised to identify and quantify several different nuclides in a single, small sample, each emitting a different type of <b>radiation.</b> High <b>purity</b> germanium detectors (HPGe) and liquid scintillation counters (LSC) can be used to quantify activities of several known sources. This can be done without buying more or expensive equipment and these machines are already available in most radiation counting laboratories. Several radionuclides (Co- 60, Cs- 137, Sr- 90, and Fe- 55) were added to a single, small (1 - ml) sample. This sample was analyzed on the HPGe and LSC and the information gathered with both instruments was used to quantify the radionuclides. Efficiencies of each machine were calculated and used to convert counts in a region of interest on the acquired LSC spectrum to sample activity and activity into counts. Results had varied accuracy, however, were found to be useful in certain situations. Small errors were associated with the gamma emitting radionuclides while larger errors were found with the other radionuclides. The large uncertainty of the Cs- 137 activity probably led to a large error in determining activities of other nuclides. It was found though several follow up experiments that when the activities are similar the analysis technique works better. This technique was found to be best utilized in a lab setting when the sample has several types of radiation, the radionuclide composition is known, and just the activities are needed. Such a technique may have limited use with unknown samples: statistical uncertainty is the limitation...|$|R
40|$|A {{stability}} indicating Ultra-Fast Liquid Chromatography (UFLC) {{method has}} been developed to estimate valethamate bromide (V&B) in tablet dosage forms and to separate analyte from other degradants and to carryout forced degradation studies. The chromatographic separation was achieved by using phenomenex kinetex 5 μ C 18 100 A (250 x 4. 6 mm) column with a flow rate of 1 mL/min in an isocratic mode with the mobile phase consisting of 0. 05 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer pH 7. 5 (adjusted with potassium hydroxide) and acetonitrile in the ratio of 50 : 50. The eluents were monitored with PDA detector at 227 nm. In this developed method valethamate bromide was eluted at a retention time of 4. 4 ± 0. 1 min. The proposed method is having linearity in the concentration range of 2 - 12 μg/mL. The present method was successfully validated with respect to system suitability, linearity, precision, accuracy, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ) and robustness as per international council for harmonization (ICH) guidelines. The drug was subjected to different degradation conditions like acid and alkali hydrolysis, oxidation, thermal and UV <b>radiation</b> etc. Peak <b>purity</b> of the drug was passed in all degradation conditions which demonstrated the specificity of assay method for it in presence of degradation products. The proposed method can be applied for determination of valethamate bromide in pure drug and in pharmaceutical formulation...|$|R
