5000|$|For many centuries, {{livestock}} {{have formed}} a mainstay of the economy. It is impossible to give a precise origin to the well known montbéliarde breed since all of the livestock in central Europe have similar characteristics and transborder exchanges were always common. One can see white cattle with red stops in certain provinces of the Czech and Slovak republics similar to those from Franche-Comté. The traditional smoked sausages, Morteau Sausage for example, {{as well as the}} drinks (syrups and lemonades <b>Rième)</b> and candies (chocolates and caramels Klaus) have made the city renowned.Smoked [...] "Saucisse de Morteau" [...] has to meet a long list of demanding criteria, such as the origin of the meat, how the animals have been fed with, the type of wood that has been used to smoke the sausages,the specific model of chimney.

25|$|The {{club was}} led from 1983 until September 2006 by {{president}} <b>Riemer</b> van der Velde, the longest tenure of any president {{with a professional}} club in the Netherlands. As the results of recent transfers that include Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Afonso Alves, Michael Bradley, Miralem Sulejmani, Petter Hansson and Danijel Pranjić (and earlier players like Jon Dahl Tomasson, Marcus Allbäck, Erik Edman, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Igor Korneev and Daniel Jensen), Heerenveen {{is one of the}} most financially secure Eredivisie clubs. A 2010 report by the Dutch football association showed that Heerenveen is the only Eredivisie club that has a financially secure budget. Under the tenure of Trond Sollied, Heerenveen won its first KNVB Cup, also its first ever major trophy. Trond Sollied, however, was sacked on 31 August 2009 due to a weak opening of the season and a conflict with the board.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of multi-disciplinary research carried out on the deposits of Moervaart depression, NW Belgium, one of the largest palaeolakes (∼ 25 km 2) that existed during the Lateglacial interstadial in NW Europe. The multi-proxy study, including physical (organic matter and calcium carbonate, magnetic susceptibility, micromorphological), botanical (pollen, macrofossils, diatoms), zoological (ostracods, molluscs, chironomids) and chemical analyses (stable carbon and oxygen isotopes) has resulted in a detailed reconstruction of the Lateglacial landscape as well of the local conditions that prevailed in the lake itself. A chronology of the record was provided by radiocarbon dating and comparison with radiocarbon dates of the nearby <b>Rieme</b> site. These yielded a good match with the regional biostratigraphy. During the Lateglacial, vegetation and geomorphology of the landscape in general changed from a tundra landscape to a boreal forest. The vegetation development, however, was interrupted by a number of cold reversals. Three centennial-scale cold oscillations are present in the record: 1) the so-called Older Dryas corresponding to GI- 1 d in the Greenland ice-cores, 2) a short and pronounced cold event during the early Allerød, which could be correlated to GI- 1 c 2 and 3) a cooling event during the late Allerød probably corresponding to the Intra Allerød Cold Period (IACP) or GI- 1 b. The latter most likely was responsible for the disappearance of the Moervaart palaeolake...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{detailed}} vegetation and environmental reconstruction for the Lateglacial interstadial in the Moervaart area (NWBelgium) is discussed, {{in relation to}} former human occupation patterns. This reconstruction {{is based on a}} multi-disciplinary research carried out on calcareous deposits of a large palaeolake (~ 25 km 2). The combination of physical (magnetic susceptibility, micromorphology, organic matter, calcium carbonate), botanical (pollen, macrofossils, diatoms), zoological (chironomids, molluscs, ostracods) and chemical analyses (stable carbon and oxygen isotopes) allowed for a highly detailed reconstruction of the lake ecosystem and vegetation surrounding the lake. The chronology of the lake record was provided by radiocarbon dating and comparison with the nearby <b>Rieme</b> sites and regional biostratigraphy. During the Bølling phase, the Moervaart palaeolake formed as result of a major rise of the groundwater table in the area. Water level rise continued during the early Allerød phase and a rich water flora and fauna developed in the lake. From this period onwards, the area provided a suitable landscape for the Federmesser Culture hunter– gatherers with fresh drinking water, extensive and fertile woodlands and lake edges for wild game hunting, plant gathering and fowling. Water levels rose to a maximumat the end of the early Allerød. Thereafter, an outlet for the lakewas formed in the east. As a result,water levels gradually decreased during the middle to late Allerød and eventually the Moervaart lake turned into a swamp and ceased to exist. In combination with the prevailing colder conditions, this led to a marked population decreasewith probably temporary abandonment of the region...|$|R
40|$|Late-glacial {{vegetation}} {{changes were}} studied at <b>Rieme,</b> NW Belgium. Human occupation of this cover sand area occurred from the Final Palaeolithic onwards. The research area is {{situated on the}} northern side of a large cover sand ridge in an undulating landscape with small ridges and depressions. The past landscape was reconstructed using a multi-disciplinary approach, including geomorphological, sedimentological, loss-on-ignition, botanical (micro- and macrofossil) and zoological analyses. AMS 14 C dating provided an accurate chronology for the sediments. Analyses were performed on three sequences located ~ 200 - 300 m apart. Our study shows that during the Bølling (GI- 1 e) wet meadows developed on the sandy soils and groundwater levels increased probably as result of permafrost melting. Shallow pools formed in depressions. During the Older Dryas (GI- 1 d) shrubs with juniper, sea-buckthorn and willow developed. Many shallow depressions were overblown with sand and deposition of organic material almost ceased. In the early Allerød (GI- 1 c) open birch woodlands developed. Due to the final melting of permafrost, groundwater levels rose further and ponds with floating-leaved open water vegetation developed. Large water level fluctuations occurred {{in one of the}} ponds. Accumulation of organic deposits ceased during the mid-Allerød. Indirect evidence for human occupation during the Allerød (GI- 1 c) was found in indications of burning of the reed-swamps in combination with the presence of large herbivores. Final Palaeolithic people probably used the northern side of the cover sand ridge as hunting area, while they settled their temporary (base) camps on the steep southern side along the extensive and deeper Moervaart lake...|$|R

6000|$|We have no {{pleasure}} in {{thinking of a}} benevolence that is only measured by its works. Love is inexhaustible, and if its estate is wasted, its granary emptied, still cheers and enriches, and the man, though he sleep, seems to purify the air and his house to adorn the landscape and strengthen the laws. People always recognize this difference. We know who is benevolent, by quite other means than the amount of subscription to soup-societies. It is only low merits that can be enumerated. Fear, when your friends say to you {{what you have done}} well, and say it through; but when they stand with uncertain timid looks of respect and half-dislike, and must suspend their judgment for years to come, you may begin to hope. Those who live to the future must always appear selfish to those who live to the present. Therefore it was droll in the good <b>Riemer,</b> who has written memoirs of Goethe, to make out a list of his donations and good deeds, as, so many hundred thalers given to Stilling, to Hegel, to Tischbein; a lucrative place found for Professor Voss, a post under the Grand Duke for Herder, a pension for Meyer, two professors recommended to foreign universities; &c., &c. The longest list of specifications of benefit would look very short. A man is a poor creature if he is to be measured so. For all these of course are exceptions, and the rule and hodiernal life of a good man is benefaction. The true charity of Goethe is to be inferred from the account he gave Dr. Eckermann {{of the way in which}} he had spent his fortune. [...] "Each bon-mot of mine has cost a purse of gold. Half a million of my own money, the fortune I inherited, my salary and the large income derived from my writings for fifty years back, have been expended to instruct me in what I now know.
