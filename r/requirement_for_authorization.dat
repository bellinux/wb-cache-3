30|$|Presentations in {{this session}} focused {{exclusively}} on bees and amphibians. It {{was evident that}} there is a need for additional toxicity testing methods for these groups. Annette Aldrich (Agroscope, Wädenswil, Switzerland) reported that amphibians are experiencing increasing pressure from diverse stressors, in particular loss of habitat, and plant protection products (PPP). The data <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorization</b> of PPP in the European Union (EU 283 / 2013) determines that amphibians must be considered to be in prospective environmental risk assessment. However, amphibians do not need to be tested for PPP authorization; therefore, there is a lack of information regarding PPP toxicity to this group. Dermal uptake is considered to be a significant route of exposure, but so far there is no adequate testing system. Katharina Kaufmann (BASF SE, Limburgerhof, Germany) presented the results of a skin absorption in vitro test (OECD TG 428), which was adapted to amphibian skin (Xenopus laevis). Dermal absorption and uptake were quantified using two reference substances, caffeine and testosterone. To address dermal toxicity, an amphibian skin corrosion test based on OECD TG 431 was successfully used. Her studies showed that amphibian skin was significantly more permeable for chemicals than human skin.|$|E

Further, sensor {{networks are}} not physically secured, i. e., sensor nodes may be physically captured and reverse engineered by the attacker. The goal {{of our research}} is to design energy-efficient Distributed Authorization Servers (DAS) resilient to logical attack (hacking) and physical attack. We propose to organize our DAS as a layered directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any request to a sensor must be routed through and authorized by every layer of the DAG. Similar concepts have been investigated by other researchers. Our research adds a structural component to the existing research. A common method for achieving longer life for a sensor network is to deploy redundant nodes and activate only a subset of nodes at one point of time. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, nobody addressed the problem of choosing the nodes to be activated. In this paper we designed a set of algorithms to choose the set of nodes for forming the DAS between the command and control centers (CCCs) and sensors collecting data. Our algorithms maximize the time required to compromise the security as well reduces the energy <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorization</b> and communication. I...|$|E

40|$|Classification of pig {{carcasses}} in the European Community {{is based}} on the lean meat percentage of the carcass. The lean meat percentage is predicted from instrumental carcass measurements, such as fat and muscle depth measurements, obtained in the slaughter-line. The prediction formula employed is derived from the data of a dissection experiment and has to meet <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorization</b> as put down in EC regulations. Requirements involve the sampling procedure and sample size for the dissected carcasses and the accuracy of prediction. Formulae are often derived by linear regression. In this paper we look at a particular type of sampling scheme. This involves selection of carcasses on the basis of carcass measurements not all of which are intended to be used as prediction variables. This sampling scheme frequently appears in requests <b>for</b> <b>authorization</b> of carcass measurement instruments and accompanying prediction formulae, {{despite the fact that it}} lacks formal statistical justification when used in conjunction with linear regression. The objective of this work was to assess the performance of the prediction formula that follows from this potentially faulty combination of sampling scheme and linear regression in relation to the requirements in the EC regulations. We show that this sampling scheme may produce poor predictions for lean meat percentage compared with proper sampling procedures with selection on prediction variables only or random sampling. We do so by computer simulation. Initially, simulated data were based on recent and historic data from The Netherlands. Prediction variables are fat and muscle depth measurements. The additional variable involved in sampling, but not included in the regression, was carcass weight. We also show that due to this faulty sampling scheme there is a serious risk that a new measurement instrument may not be authorized because performance criteria in the EC-regulations are not met...|$|R

While s. 8 of the Charter seems to give similar protection as the Fourth Amendment, they have very different <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> judicial <b>authorization,</b> reasonableness and standard of probable cause. Scrutinizing those different requirements and standards, this paper holds that the process of DNA collection is highly intrusive and would be a serious violation of s. 8 of the Charter as it could reveal an excessive amount of private information about an individual over which he/she has a strong reasonable expectation of privacy. Furthermore, it will deprive people from their right to be presumed innocent, which is protected under s. 11 (d) and significantly impact socially marginalized groups. Finally, this paper conducts an analysis of the violations under s. 1 of the Charter and indicates that none of the violations can be justified in a free and democratic society...|$|R
