40|$|A new {{numerical}} approach {{based on}} the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) for {{the solution of the}} hydrodynamic performances of cambered hulls in steady planing is formulated and validated. Due to its fully 3 D formulation, the method can be applied to both cambered and un-cambered dihedral <b>planing</b> <b>surfaces</b> of any shape without any further approximation. The exact three-dimensional wetted surface of the hull is where the body boundary condition is fulfilled. The sprays region detaching both in front of the stagnation root line and from the wet portion of the chine are modeled in the numerical scheme by means of additional vortex lattice regions. The dynamic boundary condition at the stern of the hull is non-linear with respect to the perturbation potential. Results show the dynamic pressure consistently accounts for the 3 D features of the flow {{especially in the case of}} cambered <b>planing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The numerical method is verified by a systematic analysis against semi-empirical methods and it is finally validated with experimental results on prismatic as well as cambered dihedral <b>planing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Excellent correlations are found for both types of <b>planing</b> <b>surfaces</b> that range in the same confidence interval of higher fidelity numerical models, such as RANSE solvers...|$|R

For {{the purpose}} of {{elevating}} {{the efficiency of the}} finish effect to reach the fast improvement of the surface roughness of the <b>plane</b> <b>surface,</b> so as to reduce the residual stress on the surface efficiently. This study discusses the <b>plane</b> <b>surface</b> after traditional grinding machining, of which the <b>plane</b> <b>surface</b> used a new design of finish-tool includes a nonconductive burnishing-tool and a negative electrode to execute the simultaneous processes of burnishing and electrofinishing. In the experiment, the use of the small thickness of the negative electrode is advantageous to the finish effect. High rotational speed of the finish-tool produces better polishing. Higher current rating with quicker workpiece feed rate effectively reaches the fast improvement of the surface roughness of the workpiece. The finishing effect is better with longer off-time because discharge of the electrofinishing dregs becomes easier. The experimental results show that the supply of current rating is near concern with the position of the negative electrode and the burnishing-tool...|$|R
