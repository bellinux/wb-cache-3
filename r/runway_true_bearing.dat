50|$|The {{relative}} bearing is {{measured with a}} pelorus or other optical and electronic aids to navigation such as a periscope, sonar system, and radar systems. Since World War II, {{relative bearing}}s of such diverse point sources have been and are calibrated carefully to one another. The United States Navy operates a special range off Puerto Rico and another {{on the west coast}} to perform such systems integration. Relative bearings then serve as the baseline data for converting relative directional data into <b>true</b> <b>bearings</b> (N-S-E-W, relative to the Earth's true geography).

2500|$|Compass {{navigation}} {{in conjunction}} with a map (terrain association) requires a different method. To take a map <b>bearing</b> or <b>true</b> <b>bearing</b> (a bearing taken in reference to true, not magnetic north) to a destination with a protractor compass, the edge of the compass is placed on the map so that it connects the current location with the desired destination (some sources recommend physically drawing a line). The orienting lines in the base of the compass dial are then rotated to align with actual or true north by aligning them with a marked line of longitude (or the vertical margin of the map), ignoring the compass needle entirely. [...] The resulting <b>true</b> <b>bearing</b> or map bearing may then be read at the degree indicator or direction-of-travel (DOT) line, which may be followed as an azimuth (course) to the destination. If a magnetic north bearing or compass bearing is desired, the compass must be adjusted by the amount of magnetic declination before using the bearing so that both map and compass are in agreement. [...] In the given example, the large mountain in the second photo was selected as the target destination on the map. Some compasses allow the scale to be adjusted to compensate for the local magnetic declination; if adjusted correctly, the compass will give the <b>true</b> <b>bearing</b> instead of the magnetic bearing.|$|R

To check one's progress along a course or azimuth, or {{to ensure that the}} object in view is indeed the destination, a new compass reading may be taken to the target if visible (here, the large mountain). After pointing the DOT arrow on the baseplate at the target, the compass is oriented so that the needle is superimposed over the orienting arrow in the capsule. The resulting bearing indicated is the magnetic bearing to the target. Again, if one is using [...] "true" [...] or map bearings, and the compass does not have preset, pre-adjusted declination, one must additionally add or subtract magnetic declination to convert the magnetic <b>bearing</b> into a <b>true</b> <b>bearing.</b> The exact value of the magnetic declination is place-dependent and varies over time, though declination is frequently given on the map itself or obtainable on-line from various sites.

We consider a uniform aircraft fleet mix landing on a runway with two major landing risks of wake-vortex encounter and simultaneous runway occupancy. Here, we empirically estimate minimum safe wake-vortex separation thresholds, extend go-around procedure to avoid wake-vortex encounter, and enforce the go-arounds assumed to be risk free. We introduce cost-benefit factors to study implications of enforced go-arounds, and develop models to adjust the average separation to maximize the net economic outcome.
