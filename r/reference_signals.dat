His team invented battery-state-of-charge estimation techniques, developed electric vehicle systems simulation tools, and experimented with actively blown surfaces on passenger vehicles. During the mid-1990s, Michelson's research {{began to focus}} almost entirely on unmanned vehicle systems, especially those {{with the power of}} flight. [...] He directed efforts with both U.S. Government agencies and private industry pertaining to unmanned aerial vehicles systems (UAS). [...] One of his first UAS development programs was for a traffic surveillance drone using a compound ducted fan design, made to fly over Atlanta's highways in order to fill surveillance gaps in the State's tower-mounted traffic camera system. [...] It also could be sent to traffic accident locations to gather and relay vital information in advance of first-responder arrival. Funding shortfalls resulted in the cancellation of the project before its maiden flight, but the design was later marketed for military use. [...] Michelson's focus turned to smaller vehicle systems that could fly indoors autonomously without the aid of global positioning system (GPS) <b>reference</b> <b>signals.</b> [...] Under various contracts to DARPA and the Air Force, and using internal research and development funds from the Georgia Tech Research Institute, his design team designed a micro air vehicle (MAV) known as the entomopter. [...] The NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts recognized the unique flight qualities of the entomopter and awarded Michelson two contracts to explore the feasibility of the entomopter for slow flight in Mars' lower atmosphere.|$|E

A box {{function}} {{is used in the}} representation of the <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> {{to keep track of the}} location of interaction between the signals of interest with the <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> in the time-lag representation. Similar study presented in [30, 31] on the use of XWVD for IF estimate of linear FM <b>signals</b> requires a <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> identical to the signal of interest. However, this is not necessary for this application since the <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> required is a pure sinusoid with the same frequency as the signal of interest. Hence, any power spectrum estimation method [[32], p. 214] can be used to determine the frequency of the received signal. From there, a pure sinusoid <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> of the same frequency is generated. This article assumes that the signal of interest is in perfect synchronization with the <b>reference</b> <b>signal.</b> In practical applications, the presence of phase synchronization error introduces an offset in the IIB-phase. This phase offset could be compensated using a PLL or Costas loop [33] to generate the <b>reference</b> <b>signal.</b> Furthermore, the computation of the XTFD is done based on a segment of received signal. Combining the features of the PLL and Costas loop is only possible if the XTFD is computed iteratively one sample at a time.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the position of signal source, a second set of measurements is required. Typically, this is done by making DTO and DFO measurements for a <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> simultaneous with the target signal measurement. The measurement of the <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> is purely passive and simply serves to remove the biases in the system. The same measurements that are made for the target signal, DTO and DFO, are made for the <b>reference</b> <b>signal.</b> The key to a <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> is that the transmit location of that signal is known. By comparing the DTO of the <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> and the DTO of the target signal a result known as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) can be calculated. Likewise, from the DFO of the target and the DFO of the <b>reference</b> <b>signal,</b> a Frequency Difference of Arrival (FDOA) can be determined. The TDOA and FDOA results provide a finite number of locations on the Earth’s surface, and therefore, lines of position (LOPs) are determined from the TDOA and FDOA results.|$|R
