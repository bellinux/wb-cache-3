30|$|By {{comparing}} Figures  14 and 15, one can {{see that}} when the piston rod is not subjected to a partial load, the oil is diffused to {{the periphery of the}} oil chamber in an elliptical shape. When the piston rod is subjected to a partial load, the oil is diffused into a square shape and the pressure in the oil return groove is low. Additionally, the pressure around the oil chamber gradually decreases and the pressure cloud map changes from orange to yellow, light green, and light blue in sequence. The pressure drop gradient is large and the pressure drop is significant. This is because the gap between the piston rod and sealing oil edge is reduced when the rod is subjected to a partial load. The oil in the oil chamber experiences increased resistance through the <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> gap and the <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> flow rate decreases. Therefore, the pressure in the <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> groove is lower than that without a partial load. The reduced <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> flow causes the pressure in the oil chamber to rise and the oil film pressure drop between the oil chamber and <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> groove increases.|$|E

Accurate wear prediction is difficult as random and uncertain characteristics must be factored into the estimation. The internal wear status of the axial piston pump {{is characterized by the}} <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> flow based on fault mechanism analysis of the main frictional pairs in the pump. The performance degradation model is described by the Wiener process to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the pump. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is performed by utilizing the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the initial parameters of the Wiener process while recursive estimation is conducted utilizing the Kalman filter method to estimate the drift coefficient of the Wiener process. The RUL of the pump is then calculated according to the performance degradation model based on the Wiener process. Experimental results indicate that the <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> flow is a suitable characteristic for reflecting the internal wear status of the axial piston pump, and thus the Wiener process-based method may effectively predicate the RUL of the pump...|$|E

Vilenus [18] applied trajectory {{sensitivity analysis}} to the valve-controlled cylinder system of the logging machine and the mathematical model of this system was simplified to fifth order model where the servo valve flow-pressure nonlinearity and dead zone nonlinearity were taken into consideration. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of ten main parameters containing viscous damping coefficient, conversion mass, internal leakage coefficient of servo cylinder, effective piston area of servo cylinder, effective bulk modulus, servo valve gain, nature frequency of servo valve, damping ratio of servo valve, conversion coefficient and system supply oil pressure is obtained with parameters change 1 % under single working condition. The sensitivity analysis {{results indicated that the}} sensitivity of piston rod area of the servo cylinder, servo valve gain, conversion flow coefficient and system supply oil pressure is large and that of viscous damping coefficient, internal leakage coefficient of the servo valve, damping ratio of servo vale and nature frequency of the servo valve is relatively small under the same working condition. Furthermore, Farasat et al. [19] founded the fourth order linear mathematical model of the valve-controlled cylinder position control system where the servo valve flow-pressure nonlinearity is linearized partially. The sensitivity of other parameters, such as servo valve torque motor constant, servo valve area constant, orifice opening of metering valve, system <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> pressure, supply oil volume, <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> volume and input signal voltage, is given with parameters change 1 % under single working condition by four sensitivity evaluation methods including VILENUS method, revised VILENUS method, Entirety index method and Individual characteristics method. The analysis results indicated that the sensitivity of effective piston area of servo cylinder, flow coefficient, conversion mass and input signal voltage is relatively small. Kong et al. [20 – 22] first established the fifth linear order mathematical model for the hydraulic drive unit of quadruped robot and derived the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis. Aimed at the imprecise conclusion of sensitivity analysis obtained from the linear model, some nonlinear models are also established. Besides, the sensitivity mathematical expressions with nonlinear and time-varied parameters are derived under the trotting gait working conditions. Kong et al. [23] derived the mathematical model of the second order trajectory sensitivity analysis based on the mathematical model of the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis. Therefore, the situation where the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis accuracy of some parameters is not high is improved. Then the experimental verification is conducted.|$|E
