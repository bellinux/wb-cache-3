Here, a polymer-assisted generic process and its mechanics to obtain sputtered thermoelectric (TE) telluride material-based 3 D tubular structures with unprecedented length (up to seamless 4 cm and further expandable) are shown.

Compared with a flat slab, better area efficiency is observed for a <b>rolled</b> <b>tube</b> and compared with a solid rod architecture, a <b>rolled</b> <b>tube</b> uses less material (thus making it lightweight and cost effective) and has competitive performance advantage due to a smaller contact area.

40|$|In {{three-roll}} planetary rolling process, {{there is}} secondary torsion phenomenon {{that may lead}} to rolling instability. This article proposed a new idea to alleviate the secondary torsion phenomenon by dividing the secondary torsion segment out of the roll as an independent and passive one. To study the performance of the roll with passive segment, the three-dimensional finite element models of planetary rolling process using actual roll or new roll with passive segment involving elastic–plastic and thermal–mechanical coupling were established by the software ABAQUS/Explicit, and a series of analysis had been done successfully. The rolling temperature and rolling force of planetary mill were in good agreement with the measured results, which indicated that the finite element method would supply important reference merit for three-dimensional thermo-mechanical simulation of the three-roll planetary rolling process. Comparing the simulation results of the two models, the results indicated that the change in the roll structure had just a little influence on the metal deformation, temperature, and rolling force, but it lessened the secondary torsion deformation effectively and improved the outside roundness of the <b>rolled</b> <b>tube</b> slightly.

40|$|The ductile-to-brittle {{transition}} (DBT) behavior of two similar Fe-Cr-Al oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) stainless steels was analyzed following the Cottrell–Petch model. Both alloys were manufactured by mechanical alloying (MA) but by different forming routes. One was manufactured as hot <b>rolled</b> <b>tube,</b> {{and the other}} in the form of hot extruded bar. The two hot forming routes considered do not significantly influence the microstructure, but cause differences in the texture and the distribution of oxide particles. These have little influence on tensile properties; however, the DBT temperature and the upper shelf energy (USE) are significantly affected because of delamination orientation with regard to the notch plane. Whereas in hot rolled material the delaminations are parallel to the rolling surface, in the hot extruded material, they are randomly oriented because the material is transversally isotropic.

Overall, the numbers of xylanolytic bacteria producing greater than 5 -mm-diameter zones of clearing on 0. 24 % xylan <b>roll</b> <b>tube</b> medium after 24 to 36 h of incubation were 1. 6 X 10 (8) and 4. 2 X 10 (8) /g (dry weight) of feces for the control pigs and those fed the high-fiber diet, respectively. After 1 week of incubation, {{a large number of}} smaller zones of clearing (1 to 2 mm) appeared. Besides Bacteroides succinogenes and Ruminococcus flavefaciens, which produced faint zones of clearing in xylan <b>roll</b> <b>tubes,</b> three strains which closely resembled B. ruminicola hydrolyzed and used xylan for growth. The overall numbers of cellulolytic bacteria producing zones of clearing in 0. 5 % agar <b>roll</b> <b>tube</b> medium were 0. 36 X 10 (8) and 4. 1 X 10 (8) /g for the control pigs and those fed the high-fiber diet, respectively.

Degradation of xylan and cellulose, measured by in vitro dry matter disappearance after inoculation with fecal samples, was significantly greater for pigs fed the high-fiber diet than that for the controls.

Total number of organisms by microscopic bacterial counts varied among fecal samples from 4. 48 X 10 (10) to 7. 40 X 10 (10) bacteria/g (wet weight). Comparison of different nonselective <b>roll</b> <b>tube</b> media indicated that about 30 % of the fecal bacteria could be recovered with a rumen fluid (40 %, vol/vol) medium (M 98 - 5). Recoveries of 21 and 15 %, respectively, were obtained with M 10 and rumen fluid-glucose-cellobiose agar (RGCA) media. Rumen fluid, Trypticase, sugars, and CO 2 gas phase were important components required for maximum recovery with this medium. Similar high recoveries of anaerobes were also obtained with M 98 - 5 containing swine cecal extract of place in rumen fluid or M 10 plus swine cecal extract. Significantly lower recoveries were observed with RCGA, media supplemented with swine fecal extracts, reinforced clostridial medium, brain heart infusion agar, and prereduced blood agar. Ninety percent of the bacteria isolated from <b>roll</b> <b>tube</b> media were gram positive and consisted of facultatively anaerobic streptococci, Eubacterium sp., Clostridium sp., and Propionibacterium acnes.

The colony counts on the BC medium were 85 to 100 % of those obtained on the CC medium. These colonies were pinpoint size (less {{than or equal}} to mm in diameter) but increased in size (2 to 5 mm in diameter) when carbohydrates were subsequently added.

40|$|Shortly after Koch's plating {{methods were}} introduced, there was {{developed}} by Esmarch (1886) a procedure for spreading the solid films inside <b>tubes.</b> The Esmarch <b>roll</b> <b>tube</b> culture is fa-miliar to bacteriologists, although {{it does not appear}} to have found general favor. In recent years the method was placed on a strictly quantitative basis by Wilson (1922), who found it advantageous in elaborate counts for statistical work. Roll-tube cultures are more convenient than plate cultures for many purposes. It is possible that they would be more widely used if they required less manual dexterity and practice in preparation, and were suitable for the variety of media which can be used in the regulation plating method. In order to be incubated, examined, and counted satisfactorily, the film must be hard, adhering to the tube and free from wrinkles; it should not be thick at the base of the tube, and should not splash on the cotton plug. Esmarch developed the technic primarily for gelatin. Wilson used a hard, 2. 5 per cent agar, which involves a high inoculating temperature. For critical studies of marine organisms at this laboratory it was necessary to make viable counts at sea, preferably by a procedure permitting subsequent transfer of colonies. Petri dish cultures cannot be handled conveniently on board ship. Some have used tables hung on gimbals, similar to a compass mounting, for the solidification, but this arrangement is a make-shift. The <b>roll</b> <b>tube</b> looked like a logical solution of this difficulty. It is possible that Esmarch had the same problem in mind whe...|$|R
