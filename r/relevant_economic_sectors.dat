40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This article {{develops}} a political-economy framework {{to analyze the}} formation of agricultural biotechnology policies. Going beyond accounts that largely attribute differences between US and European regulatory environments to consumer attitudes, we consider the impact of {{what amounts to a}} Schmpeterian process of “creative destruction” across the entire range of <b>relevant</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sectors</b> and interests. The analysis suggests that in Europe and in some developing countries a “strange bedfellows” constellation of concentrated economic interests (including incumbent agrochemical manufacturers, certain farm groups, and environmental protest activists) act in rational self-interest to negatively characterize GM technology in the public arena and to seek regulations that block or slow its introduction. In contrast, those interests most likely to experience welfare gains from biotechnology are the more diffused and less informed—including consumers and small farmers. The most profound implications of overregulation of agricultural biotechnology are (1) delays in the global diffusion of proven technologies, resulting in a lower rate of growth in the global food supply and higher food prices, and (2) disincentives for investing in further R&D, resulting in a slowdown in innovation of second generation technologies anticipated to introduce broad consumer and environmental benefits...|$|E
40|$|After {{describing}} the beginnings and {{state of the}} art of integrated fiber-wireless (FiWi) broadband access networks in great detail, we briefly review recent progress and point to various ongoing research activities, including the design of energy-efficient “green” FiWi access networks, advanced survivability techniques, and integration of wireless and fiber optic sensors, towards realizing adaptable, dependable, and ecoconscious future-proof broadband access networks based on both wireless and shared passive fiber media. Furthermore, we discuss service, application, business, and operation related aspects, which motivate access technology to move into a substantially different direction in the long run than continued capacity provisioning. Given that most 4 G cellular mobile network researches so far have been focusing on the achievable performance gains in the wireless front-end only without looking into the details of backhaul implementations and possible backhaul bottlenecks, we identify open key research challenges for FiWi broadband access networks. We explore ways of how they can be deployed across <b>relevant</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sectors</b> other than telecommunications per se, taking major paradigm shifts such as the Third Industrial Revolution, Energy Internet, smart grid, and explosion of mobile data traffic in today’s cellular networks into account...|$|E

40|$|The {{target of}} this Bachelor thesis was to analyse the Alcohol Market in the Czech Republic and its {{regulation}} by excise taxation between 2009 and 2015. It aims on modeling potential situations {{of the market}} liberalization. Especially it examines changes in state budget and alcohol consumption as a result of fluctuation in both excise tax and value-added tax. It also deals with potential changes of medical services costs in relation to variable alcohol consumption. Some of the partial conclusions in this work are based on expierences from alcohol prohibition period in specific countries. The work includes introduction to Czech legislation, {{as well as it}} describes the excise taxes in terms of alcohol use. The Laffers curve has been applied on alcohol market and results into an conclusion, that involves reducing the excise taxes what will lead to stimulation of the <b>relevant</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sector</b> and may have effect on the services industry as well.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} living and working {{conditions}} of textile workers {{in the city of}} Štip (Macedonia). The textile industry was highly developed during socialist times, but underwent a process of decline after the Yugoslav break-up. While it still represents a <b>relevant</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sector</b> for post-socialist Macedonia, the textile industry is highly dependent on outsourced orders from Western Europe. Local workers’ living and labour conditions, therefore, are affected by the global ‘race to the bottom’ for production costs that is typical of the garment industry. On the basis of a series of interviews conducted in Skopje and Štip with workers and factory owners, the article argues that contemporary working conditions in the Macedonian textile industry are characterised by poor labour rights, gender discrimination and widespread precarity. In contrast to the current circumstances, working and living conditions during socialist times are positively remembered by workers, who claim that their social status and living standards have deteriorated {{in the course of the}} last twenty years. This narrative of precarity is also partially shared by local entrepreneurs, who emphasise the global and local obstacles that hinder the development of the textile industry in Macedonia...|$|R
40|$|Cooperation {{between public}} and private tourism sectors is a key factor when trying to address efforts towards common objectives, thus unifying {{policies}} and strategies. However, such cooperation does not always achieve the most suitable aims and often materialises in inefficient actions and tourism policies that can negatively affect the competitiveness of a certain destination or region, ultimately leading to a poor exploitation of the resources and skills available. Therefore, it becomes essential to identify the reasons for that inefficient cooperation, as it will permit to suggest new working approaches structured around a common objective basis. Taking as a reference the opinion of the most representative tourism business sectors at the Costa Blanca, the present paper tries to highlight the existence of relevant failures regarding cooperation between the public administration and the business sector within the tourism context.

40|$|Providing regular {{analysis}} and data is fundamental for {{policy makers and}} stakeholders to monitor {{the development of an}} <b>economic</b> <b>sector</b> and make the necessary decisions to maximize the benefits it generates, be them of economic, social or environmental nature. In this line, this report contributes to quantifying and benchmarking a <b>relevant</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sector</b> in the so-called European Union Bioeconomy, the bio-based industry. The use of biomass feedstock in this specific industry has the potential to contribute to Europe's industrial and economic growth while significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, other environmental burdens, and resource dependency, through the displacement of fossil-based products with bio-based alternatives. The report focuses on a list of relevant and bio-based products and it is based on a survey of 133 companies, the full population, producing or about to produce these products (with turnover or employing labour in the EU). We find a high diversity of companies in terms of size, products and time in the market. Some companies' operations are entirely bio-based and for some other bio-based products represent a relatively small fraction of their operations. The population includes companies producing commodity and speciality chemicals and material goods into a wide range of sectors. Fifty companies answered a structured questionnaire of about 70 questions during the survey (in 2015). The response illustrates that there are a diverse set of active players ranging from large to micro companies, developing and producing a wide range of products {{from a wide range of}} feedstocks. The companies that responded to the survey report total bio-based product turnovers of the order of 6. 8 billion EUR globally and 1. 4 billion EUR in the EU. All respondents are positive about the outlook for growth in the industry. The response also indicates a rise in company activity since 2011, and there appear to be shifts in products being developed and produced, probably as a result of market testing, and technical development. The active European companies produce and sell globally, testimony of the global nature of the sector. JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|R
40|$|The United States {{provides}} annual {{estimates of}} carbon {{sources and sinks}} {{as part of its}} National Green-house Gas Inventory (NGHGI). Within this effort, carbon stocks and fluxes are reported for six land use categories that are <b>relevant</b> to <b>economic</b> <b>sectors</b> and land use policy. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop methodologies that will allow the US to align with an internationally agreed upon forest land use definition which requires forest to be able to reach 5 m in height at maturity. Models to assess height potential are available for a majority of US forests except for woodland ecosystems. We develop a set of models to assess height potential in these systems. Our results suggest that ∼ 13. 5 million ha of forests are unlikely to meet the international definition of forests due to environmental limitations to maximum attainable height. The incorporation of this height criteria in the NGHGI results in a carbon stock transfer of ∼ 848 Tg from the forest land use to woodland land use (a sub-category of grasslands) with minimal effect on sequestration rates. The development of a forest land use definition sensitive to climatic factors in this study enables a land use classification system that can be responsive to climate change effects on land uses themselves while being more consistent across a host of international and domestic carbon reporting efforts...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of recent biotechnology developments in ten CEE countries which joined the EU in 2004 and 2007. The overview covers the period 2002 - 2005 and considers these countries' performance in biotechnology as well as their policies and funding for biotechnology research and commercialisation. The chapter presents data and indicators of biotechnology performance, the arrangements for policy-making, the funding of biotechnology research and a discussion of the policy characteristics likely to support the development of biotechnology S&T systems. Findings show that countries are developing capabilities in biotechnology which contributes to a competence to absorb and utilise the knowledge that is being created {{in the rest of the}} world. There is a trend to focus on research related to pharmaceutical biotechnology and its applications. However, this strategy has limited potential to support economic growth in countries which lack a strong pharmaceutical sector. The study concludes that CEE countries are more likely to gain economic benefits from their biotechnology research by identifying and supporting several areas of biotechnology research <b>relevant</b> to strong <b>economic</b> <b>sectors</b> within their countries...|$|R
40|$|Can an {{integrated}} approach to mitigation and adaptation offer opportunities {{for a more}} effective response to climate change than the current strategies? The nature of the linkages depends on the dimensions: economic, institutional or environmental, and on the scale. Differences are pervasive: adaptation and mitigation usually have different temporal and spatial scales and are mostly <b>relevant</b> for different <b>economic</b> <b>sectors,</b> so that costs and benefits are distributed differently. The article concludes that generally the global, regional and - in most countries - national potential of synergetic options to mitigate and adapt to climate change is relatively low, and both strategies {{should be considered as}} complementary. However, a few notable exceptions are identified in the land and water management and urban planning sectors, in particular in countries or locations where these sectors provide important adaptation and mitigation opportunities. What is the theoretically most efficient and least expensive mixture of adaptation and mitigation policies may not be a very urgent policy question. Instead, five pragmatic ways of broadening climate policy are suggested, while taking into account the linkages between adaptation and mitigation: (1) avoiding trade-offs - when designing policies for mitigation or adaptation, (2) identifying synergies, (3) enhancing response capacity, (4) developing institutional links between adaptation and mitigation - e. g. in national institutions and in international negotiations, and (5) mainstreaming adaptation and mitigation considerations into broader sustainable development policie...|$|R
