500|$|Eventually, the Skinkers found {{a man in}} London {{willing to}} marry Tannakin. On {{the day of the}} wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, her face was as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired to the bedroom. When they lay in bed {{together}} for the first time, Tannakin <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would look at her in the face. He turned to look at her, and saw [...] "a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld". He reached to kiss her, but she refused, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time as the police handed control over to the SAS, they began making {{arrangements}} for the IRA operatives once they were in custody, including finding a police vehicle in which to transport the prisoners. A patrol car containing Inspector Luis Revagliatte and three other uniformed officers, apparently on routine patrol and with no knowledge of Operation Flavius, was ordered to return to police headquarters as a matter of urgency. The police car was stuck in heavy traffic travelling north on Smith Dorrien Avenue, close to the roundabout where it meets Winston Churchill Avenue. The official account states that at this point, Revagliatte's driver activated the siren on the police car in order to expedite the journey back to headquarters, intending to approach the roundabout from the wrong side of the road and turn the vehicle around. The siren apparently startled McCann and Farrell, just as Soldiers [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] were about to challenge them, outside the Shell petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue. [...] "Soldier A" [...] stated at the inquest that Farrell looked back at him and appeared to realise who [...] "A" [...] was; [...] "A" [...] testified that he was drawing his pistol and intended to shout a challenge to her, but [...] "events overtook the warning": that McCann's right arm [...] "moved aggressively across the front of his body", leading [...] "A" [...] to believe that McCann was reaching for a remote detonator. [...] "A" [...] shot McCann once in the back; [...] "A" [...] went on to tell the inquest that he believed Farrell then <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> handbag, and that he believed Farrell may also have been reaching for a remote detonator. [...] "A" [...] also shot Farrell once in the back, before returning to McCann—he shot McCann a further three times (once in the body and twice in the head). [...] "Soldier B" [...] testified that he reached similar conclusions to [...] "A", and shot Farrell twice, then McCann once or twice, then returned to Farrell, shooting her a further three times. Soldiers [...] "C" [...] and [...] "D" [...] testified at the inquest that they were moving to apprehend Savage, who was by now [...] south of the petrol station, as gunfire began behind them. [...] "Soldier C" [...] testified that Savage turned around while simultaneously reaching towards his jacket pocket at {{the same time}} as [...] "C" [...] shouted [...] "Stop!"; [...] "C" [...] stated that he believed Savage was reaching for a remote detonator, at which point he opened fire. [...] "Soldier C" [...] shot Savage six times, while [...] "Soldier D" [...] fired nine times. All three IRA members died. One of the soldiers' bullets, believed to have passed through Farrell, grazed a passer-by.|$|E
6000|$|... "So--help--me--God!" [...] he whispered, {{with blood}} thick in his voice. Then darkly, as one groping, he <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> with shaking hands. [...] "Y'u--y'u white-throated hussy!... I'll ..." ...|$|E
60|$|Dave had {{his eyes}} on the girl, and was on the point of <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> when she {{suddenly}} threw up her arms and disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|... "A most {{necessary}} precaution, I should think," [...] Lady Caroom exclaimed, <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> vinaigrette, [...] "but do go {{and change}} your things {{as quickly as}} you can.|$|R
5000|$|During the climax, {{the whole}} family has {{gathered}} to watch Virgen Mary's silent procession, and then Andrés sees Remedios and when tries to <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> Remedios husband's cronies kill him on the spot. Andrés dies in Remedios arms, still calling her [...] "Carmen".|$|R
6000|$|The mother, {{reading the}} {{disappointment}} and suffering in Helen's white face, <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> tremulously and drew {{her to her}} bosom. [...] "Never mind what they say, Nellie; it was beautiful and it was true." ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{night as}} she was passing his chair he <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and caught her and drew her down upon his knee. [...] "Sit ye down a wink. Ye're always on the move like a flibberty-bidget." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't walk any. Oh, I {{guess it}} will be all right when I get going again." [...] She tried to smile at him, and with the {{slowness}} of pain she <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> bundle.|$|E
6000|$|MOTHER. [...] "Any life." [...] Even so! And then we {{can write}} to him quickly that we have taken our revenge quickly. [She <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> husband's rifle which she passes over to her son, who {{stretches}} his hand towards it with a glance at his father.] ...|$|R
6000|$|Robina was {{quartered}} upon Geraldine in {{the holiday}} crowding of the house; and somewhere about four o'clock on the summer morning, Cherry, wakening as usual, and <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> book, heard {{a voice from the}} corner asking if she wanted anything. 'No, thank you, Bobbie. Go to sleep again.' ...|$|R
50|$|Shelby {{comes up}} and after more {{fighting}} is attacked by Elizabeth with Mike's football helmet. He tells her to stop, and when she does, Shelby <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> gun. Elizabeth then continues to beat her with the helmet. After that, Mike picks Elizabeth off her feet and carries her out.|$|R
60|$|Bessie <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> crutch {{and the two}} {{went up to the}} store, Tommy {{carefully}} suiting {{his steps}} to Bessie's slow ones. Just before they reached the store he made her shut her eyes and led her to the window.|$|E
6000|$|... "He ain't here," [...] replied Hanson. [...] "Leastwise I don't see him, do you? But I'm here, and I'm {{a damned}} sight better man than that thing ever was. You don't need him no more--you got me," [...] {{and he laughed}} uproariously and <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|Carol <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> blouse, {{which hung}} on a chair by the bed. She draped it about her shoulders, and sat up {{studying}} Kennicott, her chin in her hands. In the gray light from the small electric bulb down the hall {{she could see that}} he was frowning.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Veronica <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> {{car keys}} as the Hearst serial rapist approaches. Director Harry Winer created the {{sequence}} with fast cutting and quick dissolves {{in order to}} give the episode a visually complex scene, an aspect of production which series creator Rob Thomasthought was often neglected on the show.|$|R
50|$|Robinson has {{had great}} {{interest}} <b>for</b> poetry since <b>her</b> very early years. She was greatly encouraged by <b>her</b> parents to <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> dreams {{of becoming a}} poet. As time passed, her writing skills improved and she majored in English. She has written many poems and stories since then. Because of her ability, she has been recognized and gained many fans <b>for</b> <b>her</b> work.|$|R
50|$|According to Cicero (On Divination, 2.41.85), {{the cult}} statue Jupiter-puer ("Jupiter, the Boy") stood {{directly}} {{adjacent to the}} site where the sacred lots of ancient Praeneste were first discovered inside a flint rock. This statue, which existed in Cicero's time, showed an infant Jupiter sitting with Juno in the lap of the goddess Fortuna, <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> breast.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> jacket; and {{the waiter}} sprang forward {{and helped her}} on with it, prolonging the {{business}} needlessly. She wished him [...] "Good evening" [...] {{in a tone of}} distant hauteur, and led the way to the door. Outside the street was dim and silent. Joan held out her hand.|$|E
60|$|He <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> arm and at {{the same}} instant {{something}} clashed against the bars of one of the windows, crashing them inward to the floor, to be followed almost simultaneously by a human figure which dove headforemost into the room, its head enveloped in the skin window hangings which it carried with it in its impetuous entry.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the slight}} sharp twing was repeated. It {{seemed to come}} from outside her flesh. She shivered a little, {{thinking}} it might be a centipede. When she <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> shoulder her hand came in contact with a slender stick that had been thrust through a crack between the boards. Jim was trying to rouse her. This had been his method on several occasions when she had fallen asleep after waiting long for him.|$|E
50|$|Breacher and Brentwood {{confront a}} dying Lizzy, who accuses {{the team of}} {{stealing}} the money behind her back, motivating her to seek revenge. Brentwood is puzzled, assuming Lizzy had stolen the money. Breacher tells the dying Lizzy that he took the money. Lizzy tries to <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> weapon and Breacher kills her. The local cops arrive and Breacher disappears.|$|R
5000|$|Virginia went to Hollywood at a {{young age}} to pursue a career in acting after winning a beauty pageant. Some members of her family {{maintained}} that she took a stage name because she felt that her given name was too [...] "old-fashioned" [...] and that she was <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> paternal grandmother's maiden name, Cravens, but could not quite recall it properly.|$|R
50|$|Oftentimes, Madison has various, {{frequent}} dreams; everything being upside down, a {{girl whose}} mouth is taped and one hand <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> {{walks through the}} hall with dripping water and weird light bulbs. She sees a reflection of {{herself in the mirror}} and imagines herself putting her head through it, yet a second later, the glass is intact. There was also a little blonde girl.|$|R
60|$|Una {{had waited}} till Mr. Sidney had {{disposed}} of his soup and filet mignon. She spoke deliberately, almost sternly. She <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> new silver link bag, drew out immaculate typewritten schedules, {{and while he}} gaped she read to him precisely the faults {{of each of the}} hotels, her suggested remedies, and her general ideas of hotels, with less cuspidors, more originality, and a room where traveling-men could be at home on a rainy Sunday.|$|E
60|$|I {{stood still}} for some time. The {{sight of her}} had made me very happy. And then an unrest and a pain began to creep in on this happiness. I started to climb the tree after her, and she retreated slowly out the limb. Just as I <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> she sprang {{through the air and}} landed in the {{branches}} of the next tree. From amid the rustling leaves she peeped out at me and made soft sounds. I leaped straight for her, and after an exciting chase the situation was duplicated, for there she was, making soft sounds and peeping out from the leaves of a third tree.|$|E
60|$|He <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> {{with hands}} like claws, {{as if he}} meant to tear her, rend her. Joan was helpless, weak, terrified. Those shaking, {{clutching}} hands <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> throat and yet never closed round it. Kells wanted to kill her, but he could not. He loomed over her, dark, speechless, locked in his paroxysm of rage. Perhaps then came a realization of ruin through her. He hated her because he loved her. He wanted to kill her because of that hate, yet he could not harm her, even hurt her. And his soul seemed in conflict with two giants--the evil in him that was hate, and the love that was good. Suddenly he flung her aside. She stumbled over Pearce's body, almost falling, and staggered back to the wall. Kells had {{the center of the}} room to himself. Like a mad steer in a corral he gazed about, stupidly seeking some way to escape. But the escape Kells longed for was from himself. Then either he let himself go or was unable longer to control his rage. He began to plunge around. His actions were violent, random, half insane. He seemed to want to destroy himself and everything. But the weapons were guarded by his men and the room contained little he could smash. There was something magnificent in his fury, yet childish and absurd. Even under its influence and his abandonment he showed a consciousness of its futility. In a few moments the inside of the cabin was in disorder and Kells seemed a disheveled, sweating, panting wretch. The rapidity and violence of his action, coupled with his fury, soon exhausted him. He fell from plunging here and there to pacing the floor. And even the dignity of passion passed from him. He looked a hopeless, beaten, stricken man, conscious of defeat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but I knew!" [...] murmured Lenore, {{lifting her}} head. His right hand, brown, bare, and rough, lay outside the coverlet upon his breast. It was weakly <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> Lenore {{took it in}} both hers, while she gazed {{steadily}} down into his eyes. She seemed to see then how he was comparing the image he had limned upon his memory with her face.|$|R
50|$|Returning to Zack's charred body, Kate {{promises}} to kill Simon. Moments later, Simon also approaches the body, vowing to kill her. Kate bursts from Zack's corpse {{where she was}} hiding, bringing the cleaver down on Simon's head. He falls to the ground, but when {{she looks down at}} where his corpse should be, he is gone. A hand <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> just before the film cuts to black.|$|R
6000|$|At {{sight of}} her mother's hotel Virginia forgot every other building, every other object, and when the driver asked, respectfully, [...] "Where will {{you want to get}} off, miss?" [...] she did not reply, but rose unsteadily in <b>her</b> seat, blindly <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> bag and her wraps. Her slim, gray-robed figure, graceful even in her dismay, appealed to every onlooker, but Gregg was the one to offer a hand.|$|R
60|$|Presently, {{when all}} was about in {{readiness}} {{for a fresh}} start, she rose to her feet. Kells's bay was not tractable at the moment. Bill held out Joan's bridle to her and their hands touched. The contact was an accident, but it resulted in Bill's grasping back at her hand. She jerked it away, scarcely comprehending. Then all under the brown of his face she saw creep a dark, ruddy tide. He <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> then--put {{his hand on her}} breast. It was an instinctive animal action. He meant nothing. She divined that he could not help it. She had lived with rough men long enough to know he had no motive--no thought at all. But at the profanation of such a touch she shrank back, uttering a cry.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps at {{any other}} time I would have remarked that this request was rather unusual, {{considering}} {{the fact that she was}} very light and sure of action, extremely proud of it, and likely to be insulted by an offer of assistance. But my spirit was dead. I <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> hands, but they eluded mine, slipped up my arms as she came sliding out of the saddle, and then her face was very close to mine. [...] "Russ!" [...] she whispered. It was torment, wistfulness, uncertainty, and yet tenderness all in one little whisper. It caught me off guard or indifferent to consequences. So I kissed her, without passion, with all regret and sadness. She uttered a little cry that might have been mingled exultation and remorse for her victory and her broken faith. Certainly the instant I kissed her she remembered the latter. She trembled against me, and leaving unsaid something she had meant to say, she slipped out of my arms and ran. She assuredly was frightened, and I thought it just as well that she was.|$|E
6000|$|... "And that day, out for squid on the reef, I {{was almost}} sick for her. Mad--I know I was mad for her. We would step {{over the side}} from the big canoe, and swim down, side by side, into the delicious depths of cool and colour, and she would look at me, as we swam, and with her eyes tantalize me to further madness. And at last, down, far down, I lost myself and <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She eluded me like the mermaid she was, and I saw the {{laughter}} on {{her face as she}} fled. She fled deeper, and I knew I had her for I was between her and the surface; but in the muck coral sand of the bottom she made a churning with her squid stick. It was the old trick to escape a shark. And she worked it on me, rolling the water so that I could not see her. And when I came up, she was there ahead of me, clinging {{to the side of the}} canoe and laughing.|$|E
5000|$|Upon its release, Loliwe was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews. Simah of MOMIX gave the album an 8 out of 10, stating: [...] "The album actually proves the opinions I've been hearing about it. And it serves {{as one of the}} most powerful debuts by a South African woman. She certainly possesses the golden touch because her talent is enough to make <b>her</b> shine and <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> destiny." ...|$|R
6000|$|COMTESSE. Mrs. Shand, {{excuse me}} for saying that if half of what I hear be true, your husband is seeing that lady a great deal too often. [MAGGIE is expressionless; she <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> stocking, whereat her guest loses patience.] Oh, mon Dieu, put that down; you can buy them at two francs the pair. Mrs. Shand, why do not you compel {{yourself}} to take an intelligent interest in your husband's work? ...|$|R
50|$|While drunk, Captain Jonsen makes {{a sexual}} {{overture}} to Emily. She bites his hand before anything happens, {{but she is}} frightened by the look in Jonsen's eye as he <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> The author gives no explicit details <b>for</b> <b>her</b> fright, just a veiled description from Emily's point of view. Emily later suffers an injury to her leg, in an accident caused by Rachel, and is confined to the captain's cabin. Meanwhile, Margaret, who has become alienated from the other children, becomes Otto's concubine and moves into his cabin.|$|R
