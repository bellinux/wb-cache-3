5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings {{in the water and}} later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{first three}} {{locomotives}} were all working in Natal soon after entering service. All but one remained {{there for the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> service <b>lives</b> until withdrawal by 1962. No. NG51 was later returned to the Avontuur line to replace the retiring Class NG3 no. NG5 as yard shunter at Humewood Road.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1930 and 1932, the Chemins de Fer de l'État (État) {{obtained}} 49 locomotives {{built to}} the 4-8-2 {{design of the}} Est.

5000|$|The single was {{released}} twice during 1971; firstly on 21 May as [...] "Get Down and Get With It" [...] with writing {{credit for the}} song being given to the band and Little Richard. The band had believed the song to {{have been written by}} Little Richard. However, as the song started to climb the charts, publishers on behalf of Marchan soon got involved. The single was hurriedly re-issued as [...] "Get Down With It" [...] and correctly changed the writing credit to Marchan. In his 1999 biography Who's Crazee Now?, Holder recalled: [...] "The record company sorted out the lawsuit, but we learnt to be more careful in future." [...] "Get Down and Get with It" [...] would remain a popular song within the band's set-list for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>live</b> career.|$|R
5|$|Bellette and Haefliger {{lived and}} worked for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> in Majorca, with {{periodic}} trips to Italy. Friends such as artists Jeffrey Smart and John Olsen visited them regularly in Europe. An injury to her wrist meant that paintings prepared in 1976 for a solo exhibition were her last. Haefliger died in March 1982; Bellette survived breast cancer and a mastectomy in 1986 and died on 16 March 1991.|$|E
5|$|Parashurameshvara Temple, {{along with}} Rajarani Temple and Vaital Deula, substantiates the {{existence}} of the Devadasi tradition during the 7th and 8th centuries CE. Devadasis were girls dedicated to worship and service of a deity or a temple for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> and usually enjoyed a high societal status. They were usually transferred to the king's palace and subsequently performed for the general masses.|$|E
5|$|After their capture, {{the pirates}} {{were held at}} a prison in Guayama before their {{transfer}} to San Juan. Cofresí met with mayor Francisco Brenes, offering him 4,000 pieces of eight (which he claimed to possess) {{in exchange for his}} freedom. Although a key component of modern myth, this is the only historical reference to Cofresí's hiding any treasure. Brenes declined the bribe. Cofresí and his crew remained in Castillo San Felipe del Morro in San Juan for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> On March 21, 1825, the pirate's reputed servant (known only as Carlos) was arrested in Guayama.|$|E
50|$|The Class 10-2 {{saturated}} locomotives {{were therefore}} soon taken off mainline passenger service and put {{to good use}} on suburban work. After reboilering and reclassification to Class 10BR, most <b>of</b> the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> working <b>lives</b> were spent on the Cape Midland system where they were used on the mainline out of Port Elizabeth.|$|R
50|$|The Wi-Fi {{technology}} {{comes from}} Ruckus Wireless and is enabled by Qualcomm's Vive 802.11ac Wave 2 4x4 chipsets.

The software will be updated until at least 2022, but Qualcomm has promised to maintain the Links for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> service <b>lives.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{not known}} whether this {{back-to-back}} pair displayed the same instability in operation as the 0-6-0T back-to-back locomotive pair on the Eastern System, but by 1881 they had also been separated. In the process they were rebuilt to saddle-tank engines for use in shunting service in Port Elizabeth, where both spent the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> service <b>lives.</b> When a classification system was introduced on the CGR, they were designated 1st Class.|$|R
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of World War II, Woodruff returned to Melbourne to continue his surgical training. During his studies, he served as the surgical associate to Albert Coates. This position was unpaid, so Woodruff accepted an appointment was a part-time pathology lecturer to support himself. In January 1946, Woodruff participated in an Australian Student Christian Movement meeting, where he met Hazel Ashby, a science graduate from Adelaide. She made a great impression on Woodruff, and he married her half a year later. The couple were research partners for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bauer {{concludes that}} Brand was a courageous {{man who had}} passionately wanted to help the Jewish people, but his life was plagued after the mission by suspicion, {{including}} from {{other members of the}} Aid and Rescue Committee, because of his failure to return to Budapest. After the British released him, he joined the Stern Gang, who were fighting to remove the British from Palestine. He and Hansi Brand lived for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> in Israel, at first moving to the Givat Brenner kibbutz, then Tel Aviv, with their two sons.|$|E
5|$|By 1913, {{the revival}} at Azusa Street had lost momentum, {{and most of}} the media {{attention}} and crowds had left by 1915. Seymour remained there with his wife, Jennie, for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> as pastors of the small African American congregation, though he often made short trips to help establish other smaller revivals later in life. After Seymour {{died of a heart attack}} on September 28, 1922, Jennie led the church until 1931, when the congregation lost the building.|$|E
50|$|They were {{initially}} placed in {{service on the}} coal line between Witbank and Germiston as intended to supplement the other Mallets already working on that line. In the 1930s they were transferred to Natal {{to work on the}} line between Vryheid and Glencoe, also hauling coal. They were outstanding in their performance and remained in Natal for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> service <b>lives</b> until they were all retired and scrapped by 1940.|$|R
50|$|The Class S was {{initially}} placed in {{service in the}} Orange Free State and Natal, but they were soon transferred to Transvaal where they spent most <b>of</b> the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> working <b>lives,</b> rendering good service in yards at several centres. The Class ended up being mainly a Western Transvaal locomotive, stationed at Germiston, Kaserne, Krugersdorp, Springs and at Beaconsfield in Kimberley, with a solitary locomotive at Volksrust.

They are buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills.|$|R
5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Nasser married Tahia Kazem, the 22-year-old {{daughter}} of a wealthy Iranian father and an Egyptian mother, both of whom {{died when she was}} young. She was introduced to Nasser through her brother, Abdel Hamid Kazim, a merchant friend of Nasser's, in 1943. After their wedding, the couple moved into a house in Manshiyat al-Bakri, a suburb of Cairo, where they would live for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Nasser's entry into the officer corps in 1937 secured him relatively well-paid employment in a society where most people lived in poverty.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} {{political}} career, he became known for wearing {{a bright red}} vest and tie. He adopted this dress during his term as vice-president when he and James Reeside, a mail contractor known for his drab dress, passed a tailor's shop that displayed a bright red cloth in the window. Johnson suggested that Reeside should wear a red vest because the mail coaches he owned and operated were red. Reeside agreed to do so if Johnson would also. Both men ordered red vests and neckties, and were known for donning this attire for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Also in 2002, Doer {{argued that}} persons who kill police {{officers}} should spend the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> natural <b>lives</b> in jail, {{without access to}} Canada's so-called [...] "Faint Hope Clause" [...] for early release. [...] Three years later, {{he argued that the}} provisions of the federal Youth Criminal Justice Act were too lenient. [...] In 2007, Doer led an all-party task force to Ottawa to seek greater federal penalties for gang-related crime, youth offences and car theft.|$|R
50|$|The Arrow IIs briefly {{returned}} to {{service on the}} Newark Division, but were ultimately reassigned to the Hoboken Division for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> service <b>lives.</b> In 1997, {{the decision was made}} to retire them due to rotting floors and holes in the roofs, with ALP44s and Comet IV coaches (ordered for Midtown Direct service) in push-pull configuration as replacements. Most were scrapped in 2001. One pair (1236-1237, renumbered to 602 and 601) remains (however split) as part of SEPTA's wire inspection train.|$|R
50|$|The novel ends {{on several}} {{ambiguous}} notes. The revolution succeeds, but with hints that the upper-class courtiers, Mechanics, and Alchemists {{who supported the}} rebels will once more take control from their working-class companions. Similarly, while Mattie succeeded in her quest to free to gargoyles and gain freedom from Loharri, without her key she winds down and deactivates. The novel ends with the gargoyles promising to spend the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> now-mortal <b>lives</b> {{in an attempt to}} find the key to restore their savior.|$|R
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, many people assumed Jack Fingleton, the only full-time journalist on either team, was responsible. This belief {{may have affected}} {{the course of his}} subsequent career. Fingleton later wrote that Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman and the primary target of Bodyline, was the person who disclosed the story. Bradman always denied this, and continued to blame Fingleton; animosity between the pair continued for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Woodfull's earlier public silence on the tactics had been interpreted as approval; the leak was significant in persuading the Australian public that Bodyline was unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|The coup was {{precipitated by}} a {{heightening}} {{in the power}} struggle between the party's old guard, represented by Michel Aflaq, Salah al-Din al-Bitar, and Munif al-Razzaz, and the younger factions adhering to a Neo-Ba'athist position. On 21 February, supporters of the old guard in the army ordered the transfer of their rivals. Two days later, the Military Committee, backing the younger factions, launched a coup that involved violent fighting in Aleppo, Damascus, Deir ez-Zor, and Latakia. As {{a result of the}} coup, the party's historical founders fled the country and spent the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> in exile.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of federal {{authorities}} before sentencing, Vick agreed to deposit nearly $1 million in an escrow account with attorneys to reimburse others for the costs of caring for the confiscated dogs, {{most of which were}} being offered for adoption on a selective basis under supervision of a court-appointed specialist. Experts said some of the animals would require special care for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> During the administration of his bankruptcy case, the U.S. Department of Labor complained that these funds were paid at least partially with unlawfully withdrawn monies that Vick held in trust for himself and eight other employees of MV7, a celebrity marketing company he owned.|$|E
50|$|Its {{mission is}} to provide gifted {{students}} from across the nation {{the opportunity to develop}} their talents and skills within the challenging environment of a performing arts center and to prepare them for active careers in the American theatre and in the film and television industries.

50|$|The Class GH {{made several}} trips working the Union Express out of Cape Town and {{was capable of}} taking the train up Hex River Railpass without a banker, {{but they were not}} as {{successful}} as had been hoped and they were soon taken off that duty. Their mechanical stokers also proved to be troublesome and were eventually removed. They were transferred to Natal and worked on the Natal mainline north of Glencoe for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> service <b>lives.</b> Both were withdrawn from service by 1958.|$|R
50|$|McCraith {{attended}} the King's School in Grantham, {{before he was}} articled to Samuel Maples, a solicitor; the pair entered into a partnership as Maples and McCraith, which occupied them for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> working <b>lives.</b> McCraith was {{a founding member of}} the Nottingham Incorporated Law Society in 1875 and was elected its President in 1891; he became a Justice of the Peace the following year and served as French Vice-Consul for Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire. He was a long-serving Trustee of the Nottingham Savings Bank.|$|R
