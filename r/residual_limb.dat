40|$|Abstract—The {{insulated}} {{environment of}} the lower-limb pros-thesis can result in elevated residual-limb skin temperatures that may contribute to skin irritation, blistering, and a reduced qual-ity of life. The design and materials of the prosthetic socket, suspension system, and liner can potentially alleviate these con-ditions, but the thermal load may vary with activity and location within the socket. To characterize the thermal environment at the skin-prosthesis interface, we made temperature meas-urements on five transtibial amputees at 14 locations on the <b>residual</b> <b>limbs.</b> After the participants donned their prosthesis and rested in the seated position for 15 min, the mean skin tem-peratures of their <b>residual</b> <b>limbs</b> increased by 0. 8 degrees Cel-cius.

50|$|In 1953, {{with what}} he had learned at Sunnybrook Hospital, {{opportunity}} drew James to the University of California,Berkeley, where, working with C.W.

As Kevin Carroll, James C.

The Berkeley team developed the PTB Below knee prosthesis for amputations below the knee, completely new technologies, The PTB prosthesis enabled the amputee to walk around with no corset or side joints. Not only did these new adaptations {{solve the problem of}} constriction of circulation and ease restriction on the thigh, but it allowed people to be amputated below the knee twice as was usual for amputations related to circulatory problems, thereby increasing their function.|$|E

50|$|An {{amputation}} {{between the}} knee and ankle joints transecting the tibia, or shinbone, {{is referred to as}} a transtibial amputation. In this situation, the patient may retain volitional control over the knee joint. The cause of amputation may dictate the length of the <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> and the corresponding level of control of the prosthesis. The main impairment for transtibial amputees is the lack of adjustment of the foot and ankle. The foot acts as a lever arm directly attached to the calf muscle, but more than that, it absorbs the impulse from the ground and adapts dynamically to changes in the ground's surface. Transtibial amputees lose the muscle activation pathways necessary for the physical ability to generate work about the ankle joint, as well as the somatosensory and proprioceptive pathways of the lower leg.|$|E
50|$|Unlike transtibial amputations, transfemoral amputations {{occur between}} the hip and the knee joints, {{along the length}} the femur. Therefore, the patient's <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> is {{controlled}} solely by the hip joint. Implementing a prosthetic leg requires the user to mechanically control the behaviors of the prosthetic knee and ankle joints through gross adjustments of the hip, rather than the finer and more precise movements of the missing joints. Simple tasks such as walking on level ground, sit-to-stand transfers, and climbing stairs require complex alternative muscle activation patterns because the amputee cannot generate a moment about the prosthetic knee. This poses a problem when knee flexion is required, especially during {{the transition from the}} stance phase to the swing phase.Transfemoral amputees, on average, have more variability in stride length and walking speed, more asymmetry in temporal measures between limbs, and have an overall slower walking speed than transtibial amputees.|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of spatial}} {{compounding}} on image resolution and speckle noise are studied. Using computer simulation, it is shown that spatial compounding using averaged reconstruction can significantly im-prove lateral resolution while slightly deteriorate axial resolution.

While the fact that spatial compounding can effectively reduce speckle noise is well known, the analysis in this paper indicates that to maximize speckle reduction, the compo-nent echo amplitudes must meet two conditions: to be mutually independent and to have the same mean power. These findings provide useful guidelines for the analysis and optimization of the performance of an ultrasound scanning system that has been specially developed for imaging <b>residual</b> <b>limbs...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to illustrate some new fitting techniques for the upper extremity amputee using two types of custom silicone liners manufactured at the Bloorview MacMillan Children’s Centre in Toronto.

With the wide variety of shapes (and sizes) presented by our client’s <b>residual</b> <b>limbs</b> custom silicone liners were indicated over off-the-shelf liners. Two techniques for fabricating custom silicone liners have been developed at the BMCC. The two fabricating procedures are described as custom injected and custom rolled silicone liners. There are advantages and disadvantages to both techniques.

5000|$|Until recently, the {{dominant}} hypothesis {{for the cause}} of phantom limbs was irritation in the severed nerve endings (called [...] "neuromas"). When a limb is amputated, many severed nerve endings are terminated at the <b>residual</b> <b>limb.</b> These nerve endings can become inflamed, and were thought to send anomalous signals to the brain. These signals, being functionally nonsense, were thought to be interpreted by the brain as pain. Treatments based on this hypothesis were generally failures. In extreme cases, surgeons would perform a second amputation, shortening the stump, with the hope of removing the inflamed nerve endings and causing temporary relief from the phantom pain. But instead, the patients' phantom pains increased, and many were left with the sensation of both the original phantom limb, as well as a new phantom stump, with a pain all its own. In some cases, surgeons even cut the sensory nerves leading into the spinal cord or in extreme cases, even removed the part of the thalamus that receives sensory signals from the body.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{artificial}} limbs {{are attached}} to the stump of the amputee by belts and cuffs or by suction. The stump either directly fits into a socket on the prosthetic, or—more commonly today—a liner is used that then is fixed to the socket either by vacuum (suction sockets) or a pin lock. Liners are soft and by that, they can create a far better suction fit than hard sockets. Silicone liners can be obtained in standard sizes, mostly with a circular (round) cross section, but for any other stump shape, custom liners can be made. The socket is custom made to fit the <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> and to distribute the forces of the artificial limb across the area of the stump (rather than just one small spot), which helps reduce wear on the stump. The custom socket is created by taking a plaster cast of the stump or, more commonly today, of the liner worn over the stump, and then making a mold from the plaster cast. Newer methods include laser guided measuring which can be input directly to a computer allowing for a more sophisticated design.|$|E
50|$|Targeted reinnervation {{does not}} require any implants. Therefore, {{it does not have}} the issue of tissue foreign body {{response}} as chronic brain implant technology does. The targeted muscle acts as a natural amplifier for the neuronal signals produced by the transferred residual nerves. This is an advantage over technologies like EEG and fMRI that utilize weaker signals. With targeted reinnervation, multiple yet independent EMG signals can be produced, thus multiple functions of the artificial limb can be controlled simultaneously. For example, the patient would be able to perform actions such as throwing a ball relatively gracefully, exhibiting simultaneous control of elbow and hand. The control is also intuitive to the patient because the EMG signals are generated by transferred <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> nerves, unlike traditional myoelectric prosthetics where EMG signals have to be generated by muscles normally not involved in arm or wrist functions. Also, existing commercially available myoelectric prostheses, such as powered wrists, elbows can be used. There is no need to develop specific prostheses for targeted reinnervation. By means of nerve transfer, targeted reinnervation can also provide sensory feedback, which has not been achieved by any other form of prosthetics aforementioned.|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a novel interface that gives upper-limb amputees a virtual hand that can manipulate objects in a challenging environment. The interface registers specific myokinetic {{activity of the}} <b>residual</b> <b>limbs,</b> and encodes the intended voluntary move-ments that are then actualized as virtual hand motions. The composite myokinetic interface-virtual reality (MKI-VR) system consists of an array of pressure sensors mounted in an arm sleeve, sensors of elbow- and shoulder-joint angles, a trained filter derived from the pseudoinverse of a response matrix, and a virtual hand model, programmed in Java 3 D. Users can manipulate virtual objects such as balls and pegs in a 3 D training environment, while their performance at various difficulty levels is scored. In preliminary tests, upper-limb amputees readily gained the ability to grasp and release virtual objects.

50|$|A {{prosthetist}} is {{a person}} who has been certified to fit prostheses to <b>residual</b> <b>limbs</b> of the upper and lower extremities. The fitting of lower extremity prostheses, for example, involves making a socket that fits the residuum as a first step. The socket is usually manufactured by glass or carbon fiber infused with acrylic resin or from thermoplastics over a positive model of the residuum. The socket is connected to a foot or ankle assembly {{and in the case of}} above knee amputation, an artificial knee. The connecting components are usually an aluminum tube with two part pyramid alignment devises one at each end. One of the devices connects to the ankle and the other one to the socket. They allow the foot to be placed in proper position to support the person's weight with the least possible lateral forces acting through the system. Prostheses are aligned with the client walking, while the prosthetist observes the gait and corrects for any deviations from optimized movement when the leg is in the air and for its position at heel strike and toe off.|$|R
40|$|Silicone {{interfaces}} {{have been}} utilized {{in the field}} of prosthetics in a multitude of applications over the last three decades.

Clinically, as we incorporate custom silicone into the mainstream design of the “standard” upper extremity prosthesis, we are beginning to see unexpected benefits with the usage of this material on otherwise healthy skin. All of the therapeutic benefits of silicone are now being combined with normal prosthetic usage including limb healing and scar tissue maturation and management.

Managing the interface between silicone socket and hard socket without compromise to signal loss via an electrical-mechanical interface about the pin lock has been investigated, and although function was acceptable, this approach was technically complex. An alternate and potentially simple solution is the use of an electrically conductive silicone interface within the silicone socket and localized at the electrode site. To investigate the feasibility of this approach, a prosthetic socket and silicon sleeve using the conductive material was fabricated and evaluated on a single subject.

40|$|Using {{artificial}} limbs {{to restore}} function for amputees {{is a concept}} that dates back to approximately 700 BC. Despite this, attaching artificial limbs to the body remains clinically challenging, with inadequate mechanical fixation, poor stump-socket fitting particularly to short <b>residual</b> <b>limbs,</b> friction leading to the development of pressure sores, infection of the stump soft tissues and sweating often leading to limb disuse. Eliminating the socket, by directly attaching the artificial <b>limb</b> to the <b>residual</b> bone through osseointegration transmits forces through the bony skeleton alleviating the problems associated with the socket. This technology also has the potential to increase the range of motion of the proximal residual joint particularly with humeral amputees, permits comfortable sitting, and has been shown to transmit sensory signals to the bone; so called osseoperception. Osseointegration to attach the exoprosthesis was introduced by Rickard Brånemark. Infection was the main complication in a cohort of transfemoral amputees in the United Kingdom being treated using osseointegrated amputation prostheses. Based on the osseointegration concept we have developed intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prostheses (ITAP) which attempts to overcome the problems associated with infection by integrating dermal and epidermal tissues with the implant, creating a soft tissue seal around the implant.

All treatments had waterbars, the minimum trail closure best management practice (BMP), to provide upslope and downslope borders of experimental units.
