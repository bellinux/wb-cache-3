40|$|AbstractObjectiveAnesthesia {{of patient}} for direct {{laryngoscopy}} (DL) and microlaryngosurgery (MLS) was technically challenging. The anesthetist had usually {{concern about the}} loss of spontaneous ventilation and occurrence of obstruction after induction with IV drugs. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare between flexible fibro-optic bronchoscope and direct <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> during awake intubation in patients with laryngeal mass scheduled for direct laryngoscopic surgery (DL) and microlaryngosurgery (MLS). It was a study to assess the best way for intubation with the least side effects, discomfort to the patients and high success rate of intubation. MethodsFourty adult patients Malampati 1, 2 and ASA I,II,III with small laryngeal mass or polyp scheduled for direct laryngoscope (DL) and microlaryngoscopic surgery. They were randomly computerized divided into two groups 20 patients in each group; Group FO; intubation with flexible fibro-optic bronchoscope. Group RL; intubation with <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope.</b> ResultsThe time of intubation was statistically significantly higher in fibro-optic group (group FO) (92 ± 34 s) than <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> group (group RL) (35 ± 5 s). There were two patients in group RL needed 2 nd intubation attempt for better visualization of the view but there were six patients in group FO needed 2 nd intubation attempt for suction of secretion and blood. According to modified six point scale the patients ranged between 1 and 3 in group FO while they range between 2 and 4 in group RL. ConclusionThe study suggested that the flexible fibro-optic bronchoscope was very comfortable to the patients and less traumatic with less cardiovascular stress but it took longer time and had a higher incidence of 2 nd attempt and failure rate. Accordingly, it recommend the use of flexible fibro-optic bronchoscope in expected small size and non-bloody mass with prepared <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> and tube with stylet to be ready to use if needed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesAnesthesiologists are {{responsible}} for airway management whenever they assume the anesthesia of a patient. In this study, we compare the hemodynamic parameters of rigid laryngoscopy and lighted stylet in patients with coronariopathies. Patients and methodsThis randomized clinical trial included 40 patients undergoing myocardial revascularization assigned into two groups: lighted stylet and <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope.</b> Besides time of tracheal intubation in each group, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, changes in ST segment, and central venous pressure were evaluated during patient preparation, 1 minute and 5 minutes after anesthetic induction, and 1 minute after tracheal intubation. ResultsBoth groups were homogenous regarding demographic data. Time of tracheal intubation in the <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> group (24 ± 5 sec) was {{lower than that of}} the lighted stylet group (28 ± 7 sec), but without significance. Heart rate showed a reduction in both groups during anesthetic induction (p 0. 05). In the <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> group mean arterial pressure increased after tracheal intubation to levels close to those observed during patient preparation (p > 0. 05), while in the lighted stylet group mean arterial pressure remained below baseline levels (p < 0. 05). Central venous pressure increased on both groups at all times (p < 0. 05). ConclusionsIt was possible to observe that both techniques are safe for tracheal intubation in patients with coronariopathies. However, lighted stylet has fewer repercussions on mean arterial pressure...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a new device that provides a simple, noninvasive method of measuring accurate lesion size while using an endoscope. Methods. We developed a <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> with a built-in laser-ruler using a one-light emitting diode and an acrylic plate. The invention incorporates a built-in laser diode that projects an auto-parallel beam into the optical path of the <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> to form two spots in the field of view. Results. While the interspot distance remains consistent despite changes in focal plane, magnification, or viewing angle of the laryngoscope, projection to an uneven surface introduces certain variations in the shape, and size of the spots, and the distance between the two spots. Conclusion. The device enables a laryngologist to easily measure the distance between landmarks, as well as the change in real size, and the progressive change of vocal fold lesions in an outpatient setting...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances have made airway management safer. Because difficult intubation remains challenging to predict, having tools readily available {{that can be}} used to manage a difficult airway in any setting is critical. Fortunately, video technology has resulted in improvements for intubation performance while using laryngoscopy by various means. These technologies have been applied to rigid optical stylets, flexible intubation scopes, and, most notably, <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscopes.</b> These tools have proven effective for the anticipated difficult airway as well as the unanticipated difficult airway...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The main {{objectives}} of anesthesia for laryngeal surgery are to provide immobile field, enough {{space for the}} <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope,</b> secured airway and ventilation, hemodynamic stability and of the same importance is the uneventful recovery (suggest to cancel). The {{aim of this study}} is to compare the effects of three different drugs given by nebulizing techniques. We compared methylprednisolone, racemic epinephrine and lidocaine effects on postoperative respiratory complications after short-term laryngeal surgery 	 Materials & Methods: Sixty ASA I & II children admitted for minor laryngeal surgery were included in this prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, and double-blinded study. Patients were randomly allocated into four even groups, 15 each: 0. 9 % Normal Saline (group I) control group, Methylprednisolone 3. 0 mg/kg (group II), Racemic Epinephrine 2. 25 % 0. 005 ml/kg (group III) and Lidocaine 1. 0 mg/kg (group IV). All the drugs were prepared in 5 ml solution and given over 10 min periods by nenulizer in the recovery area before shifting the patient to the OR. Postoperative respiratory complications were assesed using Postoperative Respiratory System Evaluation Scoring (PRSES). Results: Patients of Lidocaine and R-Epinephrine groups showed better recovery criteria as regard incidence of respiratory complications compared to Methylprednisolone and Saline groups. All the drug groups showed significant difference compared to the saline group. Conclusions: Lidocaine and R-Epinephrine administration by nebulizatin in the immediate preoperative period is very effective in reducing postoperative respiratory complications after short-term laryngeal surgery by way of <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope.</b> Methylprednisolone is less effective...|$|E

30|$|Surgery and {{anesthetic}} {{management of}} patients with a laryngeal tumor occupying {{the space of the}} glottis is challenging for anesthesiologists because airway obstruction can occur during surgery. Temporary tracheostomy, endotracheal intubation using a thin endotracheal tube (ETT), and high-frequency jet ventilation have been used for airway management for laryngoscopic surgery with a <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> in such patients [1]. Another option is a laryngeal mask airway (LMA), which has been used for airway protection, and introduction of a flexible laryngoscope for surgery has been successfully used in such patients [2]. There has been no report of LMA insertion itself exacerbating airway obstruction in such patients. Here, we report a patient with a laryngeal polyp in whom manual positive pressure ventilation was easily achieved after anesthetic induction, but the airway was completely obstructed by the polyp lodged between the vocal cords following LMA insertion.|$|E

40|$|Foreign body {{ingestion}} is {{a commonly}} encountered clinical problem. In particular, sharp foreign bodies {{lodged in the}} esophagus or hypopharynx can cause complications and require urgent removal. Removal by flexible esophagogastroduodenoscopy or rigid esophagoscopy is the treatment of choice and has high success rates, but cases in which these methods are unsuccessful must be treated with an external incision. A 62 -year-old man was referred for a fish bone lodged in the hypopharynx {{that could not be}} removed by flexible esophagogastroduodenoscopy. We removed the bone transorally using a specially designed <b>rigid</b> curved <b>laryngoscope.</b> Based on our experience, this method may have clear practical value due to advantages of a wide field of view and use of multiple rigid forceps. Indications may be limited, but this novel method may reduce the limitations of noninvasive removal of foreign bodies...|$|R
40|$|Infected lateral {{cervical}} cysts in newborn are rare. We {{present the}} case of a baby born at 41 weeks of gestation. At day 3, persistent cyanosis was noted, and a mass appeared in the left cervical region next to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. No cutaneous sinus was visible. Ultrasound imaging showed no sign of blood flow within the mass and no septae. The mass extended down to the aortic arch and pushed the trachea to the right. A cervical lymphangioma was first suspected. Puncture of the mass evacuated 80 mL of pus, and a drain was put in place. Opacification through the drain showed a tract originating from the left pyriform fossa. Preoperative laryngoscopy and catheterization of the fistula tract confirmed the diagnosis. The cyst was totally excised up to the sinus with the assistance of a guidewire inserted orally through a <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope.</b> This is a rare case of an infected pyriform sinus cyst in the neonatal period...|$|E
40|$|One known problem within {{laryngoscopy}} is the spatially limited view {{onto the}} hypopharynx and the larynx through the endoscope. To examine the complete larynx and hypopharynx, the laryngoscope can be rotated about its main axis, {{and hence the}} physician obtains a complete view. If such examinations are captured using endoscopic video, the examination can be reviewed in detail at a later time. Nevertheless, in order to document the examination with a single representative image, a panorama image can be computed for archiving and enhanced documentation. Twenty patients with various clinical findings were examined with a 70 ° <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope,</b> and the video sequences were digitally stored. The image sequence for each patient was then post-processed using an image stitching tool based on SIFT features, the RANSAC approach and blending. As a result, endoscopic panorama images of the larynx and pharynx were obtained for each vid-eo sequence.

Extranasal manifestations were noted in nine cases. Two patients attended with laryngopharyngeal and one with lacrimal sac presentation–subsequent nasal endoscopic examination revealed presence of nasal masses, too.

40|$|BACKGROUND Laryngoscopy by <b>rigid</b> direct <b>laryngoscope</b> for {{the purpose}} of {{intubation}} causes haemodynamic stress response (increase in heart rate and mean arterial pressure). The reduction of the stimulation of the oropharynx by the design of laryngoscope blade has reduced the magnitude of the haemodynamic stress response. In this study, the haemodynamic stress response (increased heart rate and increased mean arterial pressure) before, during and after laryngoscopy with McCoy, Macintosh and Miller laryngoscope blades are compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty patients in the age group of 20 to 50 years of both sexes posted for elective surgeries under general anaesthesia were divided into three groups of 20 each as McCoy, Miller and Macintosh group and the haemodynamic stress response to laryngoscopy before, during and after laryngoscopy were compared. Statistical Analysis- The statistical data were analysed by using ANOVA and paired t-test and the p value of < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS The results of the study showed that the increase in the heart rate and mean arterial pressure were least with McCoy, most with Miller and in between with Macintosh.

40|$|Ibinson et al.; {{licensee}} BioMed Central Ltd. <b>Rigid</b> video <b>laryngoscopes</b> {{are popular}} alternatives to direct laryngoscopy for intubation, but further large scale prospective studies comparing these devices to direct laryngoscopy in routine anesthesiology practice are needed. We {{hypothesized that the}} first pass success rate with one particular video laryngoscope, the GlideScope, would be higher than the success rate with direct laryngoscopy. Methods: 3831 total intubation attempts were tracked in an observational study comparing first-pass success rate using a Macintosh or Miller-style laryngoscope with the GlideScope. Propensity scoring was then used to select 626 subjects matched {{between the two groups}} based on their morphologic traits. Results: Comparing the GlideScope and direct laryngoscopy groups suggested that intubation would be more difficult in the GlideScope group based on the Mallampati class, cervical range of motion, mouth opening, dentition, weight, and past intubation history. Thus, a propensity score based on these factors was used to balance the groups into two 313 patient cohorts. Direct laryngoscopy was successful in 80. 8 % on the first-pass intubation attempt, while the GlideScope was successful in 93. 6 % (p < 0. 001; risk difference of 0. 128 with a 95 % CI of 0. 0771 - 0. 181). Conclusion: A greater first-attempt success rate was found when using the GlideScope versus direct laryngoscopy. In addition, the GlideScope was found to be 99 % successful for intubation after initial failure of direct laryngoscopy, helping to reduce the incidence of failed intubation...|$|R
40|$|URL] Pentax-AWS {{system is}} a <b>rigid</b> {{indirect}} video <b>laryngoscope</b> with integrated tube guidance. Complications associated with this device are not well understood. We report two cases of epiglottis malposition during intubation with the Pentax-AWS. The standard technique of using the Pentax-AWS system involves direct elevation of the epiglottis for exposure of the vocal cords. The blade tip should be passed posterior to the epiglottis for laryngeal exposure, but pressure on the anterior surface of the epiglottis by the tip can rarely happen even during the correct maneuver. Although the Pentax-AWS provides clear images of the airway structures, it is sometimes difficult to observe the epiglottis continuously because the camera is located beneath the blade tip. Consequently, {{the view of the}} epiglottis from the camera may be impeded by the blade tip and may result in undiagnosed epiglottis malposition. The AWS's structural feature and its approach to the larynx can be associated with increased chance of unexpected epiglottis folding. It is particularly important to confirm normal position of the epiglottis during withdrawal of the device to prevent this complication...|$|R
30|$|The {{patient was}} not given premedication, and routine noninvasive {{monitoring}} including blood pressure, percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO 2), and end-tidal CO 2 was performed in the operating room. SpO 2 was 97 % on room air, and oxygen was delivered by a facemask at 7  L/min in the operating room. During anesthesia that was induced with incremental administration of propofol (total dose of 170  mg), spontaneous ventilation was manually assisted and was followed by manual positive pressure ventilation without any airway obstruction. However, complete airway obstruction occurred immediately after a size 4 LMA (LMA Supreme™, Teleflex Co., NC, USA) was inserted. Maneuvers including changing the LMA position and increasing and decreasing the volume of cuff air did not improve the difficult airway. A flexible laryngoscope revealed airway obstruction due to the polyp lodged between the vocal cords (Fig.  1 c), and the polyp could not be moved by pulling with forceps through the LMA. Spontaneous respiration returned, but the airway was still not patent even though the maneuvers were repeatedly tried. SpO 2 decreased to 88 %, and the LMA was removed. Soon after the removal, patency of the airway was dramatically improved and SpO 2 returned to 100 %. Transient tracheostomy was then carried out under general anesthesia with 2.0 % of sevoflurane in 40 % oxygen with assisted spontaneous ventilation and injection of 250  μg fentanyl.

40|$|Aspiration of gastric {{contents}} {{remains an}} im-portant cause of {{morbidity and mortality}} in patients requiring general anaesthesia for emer-gency surgery [1 - 3]. None of the anaesthetic techniques for preventing this complication is either completely successful or always applicable [2]. However, isolation of the trachea from the gastrointestinal tract with a cuffed tracheal tube is perhaps the best method for preventing aspira-tion. There are two techniques, each associated with its own hazards, used commonly for this purpose [2 - 4]. First, a rapid sequence induction and tracheal intubation following pre-oxygenation and cricoid pressure [4 - 6]; and second, intubation of the trachea in an awake patient using a <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> [7 - 9]. There {{do not appear to be}} any well controlled clinical trials comparing these two techniques. Depending on the details of its performance, the hazards and difficulties of a rapid sequence induction and intubation include: incomplete relaxation; coughing during intubation; problems with cricoid pressure; regurgitation; cardio-vascular changes; mechanical problems; difficult intubation; delayed intubation; failed intubation; cyanosis and cardiovascular collaspe [4 - 6, 10 - 12]. The hazards and difficulties of an awake rigid intubation include: any condition which results in a lack of rapport between the patient and anaesthetist; discomfort for the patient; aspiration because of either topical anaesthesia applied to larynx or heavy sedation [2, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14].

40|$|Introduction: Intubation injury {{resulting}} in laryngeal pathology is recognised {{as a possible}} complication of preterm birth, yet few published studies have examined such pathology {{and its relation to}} voice outcomes. This study reports on the results of prospective laryngeal function examinations of a cohort of very preterm children, all of whom presented with significant dysphonia at school age. Materials and methods: The laryngeal pathology of 20 very preterm children, born between 23 and 29 weeks gestation, was examined under halogen and stroboscopic conditions. Laryngeal structure and function were assessed using a <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> or a flexible nasendoscope. The approach was selected based on the age and/or likely compliance of the child. Results: Nineteen children were found to have structural laryngeal pathology. Fourteen children presented with a chink to the posterior glottis and all demonstrated at least a mild degree of supraglottic hyperfunction. Other common findings were arytenoid prolapse and vocal fold immobility. More isolated findings included posterior scar band, vocal fold atrophy, arytenoid oedema and growth on the vocal folds. One child who presented with structural laryngeal pathology was never intubated. Discussion: Supraglottic hyperfunction was common to all participants, regardless of {{the nature and extent of}} underlying structural laryngeal pathology. Posterior glottic chink was the most common pattern of incomplete vocal fold closure. These data support the hypothesis that very preterm children adopt supraglottic tightening to compensate for underlying laryngeal pathology. The mechanism underlying laryngeal damage in the child who was not intubated is unclear. Conclusions: Voice quality of very preterm children is affected by both laryngeal structure and function. A trial of behavioural voice treatment is recommended to evaluate any therapeutic response in this population...|$|E
50|$|Vocal fold imaging {{techniques}} {{are used by}} clinicians to examine the vocal folds and allows them to detect vocal pathology and assess {{the quality of the}} vocal fold vibrations. Laryngeal stroboscopy is the primary clinical tool used for this purpose. Laryngeal stroboscopy uses a synchronized flashing light passed through either a <b>rigid</b> or flexible <b>laryngoscope</b> to provide an image of the vocal fold motion; the image is created by averaging over several vibratory cycles and is thus not provided in real-time. As this technique relies on periodic vocal fold vibration, it cannot be used in patients with moderate to severe dysphonia. High speed digital imaging of the vocal folds (videokymography), another imaging technique, is not subject to the same limitations as laryngeal stroboscopy. A rigid endoscope is used to take images at a rate of 8000 frames per second, and the image is displayed in real time. As well, this technique allows imaging of aperiodic vibrations and can thus be used with patients presenting with all severities of dysphonia.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARYIntroductionWhen {{choosing}} the appropriate management for a difficult airway patient, either established or suspected, several intervention options should be considered. Some management algorithms recommend awake intubation under direct laryngoscopy or optical instruments. Rigid and semi-rigid stylets are optical devices developed {{for managing the}} difficult airway that {{have proven to be}} fast, non-traumatic and reliable. ObjectivesTo describe the use of different strategies to approach the difficult airway in an emergency surgery, using the Airway RIFL (<b>rigid</b> intubation fiberoptic <b>laryngoscope)</b> as one of the options. Methodology and resultsThis is a case of a 69 -yr old patient admitted to the ER for hemostasis and surgery of a chest neoplasia. The patient was considered a difficult airway patient because of a history of multiple tumor resections and radiotherapy in the airway, resulting in a notorious facial deformity. Intubation on a full stomach. Topical anesthesia was considered the first choice for airway management, remifentanil sedation and direct laryngoscopy but this is not possible due to a limited oral opening: three nasal intubation attempts were made but failed. Then it was decided to use the Airway RIFL device and the procedure was successful. ConclusionsWhen dealing with a difficult airway patient, having several management strategies at hand, local anesthesia and sedation, allow for excellent patient collaboration and a fast orotracheal intubation using a rigid fiberscope, even under emergency situations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Selection of {{the ideal}} airway device in {{patients}} with difficult airways (DA) or potentially difficult airways remains controversial, especially, for a novice anesthesia physician (NP) who must deviate from conventional direct laryngoscopy with a <b>rigid</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> following a failed intubation and employ one of the several alternative devices. The author determines and compares tracheal intubation success rates, times to success and complications of a novice physician using four alternative airway devices in 20 obese (BMI more than 27. 5) patients who may {{be more difficult to}} intubate than normal weight patients. Materials and Methods: In this prospective randomized experimental study the author investigates a novice physician&#x 2032;s use of the Bullard&# 8482;, Fiberoptic&# 8482;, Fastrach&# 8482;and Trachlight&# 8482; comparing reliability, rapidity and safety of orotracheal intubations. Following induction of anesthesia the NP was allowed up to a maximum of two attempts per device at oral intubation. Mean intubation times plus/minus SD, per cent success rates and postoperative complications were evaluated for each device. Results: The Fastrach&# 8482; was successful 100 &#x 0025; of the time on the first attempt requiring a mean time of 55 seconds plus/minus 6. 6. All intubations were unsuccessful following two attempts with the Fiberoptic&# 8482;.
