40|$|We {{previously}} isolated a novel rat cDNA encoding a basic helix–loop–helix {{transcription factor}} named <b>Relax,</b> whose {{expression in the}} developing central nervous system is strictly limited to discrete domains containing precursor cells. The timing of <b>Relax</b> expression coincides with neuronal differentiation. To investigate the involvement of <b>Relax</b> in neurogenesis we tested whether <b>Relax</b> activated neural genes in the ectoderm by injecting <b>Relax</b> RNA into Xenopus embryos. We demonstrate that ectopic <b>Relax</b> expression induces a persistent enlargement of the neural plate and converts presumptive epidermal cells into neurons. This indicates that <b>Relax,</b> when overexpressed in Xenopus embryos, has a neuronal fate-determination function. Analyses both of <b>Relax</b> overexpression in the frog and {{of the distribution of}} <b>Relax</b> in the rat neural tube strongly suggest that <b>Relax</b> is a neuronal fate-determination gene...|$|R

5|$|In a sense, Rule 184 solves this problem, as follows. if Rule 184 is run on {{a finite}} set of cells with {{periodic}} boundary conditions, with an unequal number of 0s and 1s, then each cell will eventually see two consecutive states of the majority value infinitely often, but will see two consecutive states of the minority value only finitely many times.
