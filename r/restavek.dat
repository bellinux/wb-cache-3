500|$|Child {{trafficking}} is {{a substantial}} part of the human trafficking crisis in Haiti. [...] One major form of child trafficking and child slavery, affecting an estimated 300,000 Haitian children, is called the <b>restavek</b> system, in which children are forced to work as domestic servants. [...] The <b>restavek</b> system accounts for the lion's share of human trafficking in Haiti.|$|E
500|$|In {{accordance}} with these international conventions, Haitian law prohibits abuse, violence, exploitation, and servitude {{of children of}} any kind {{that is likely to}} harm their safety, health, or morals. Additionally, it declares that all children have the right to an education and to be free from degrading and inhumane treatment. Enacted in 2003, Article 335 of the Haitian Labor code prohibits the employment of {{children under the age of}} 15. Furthermore, an Act passed in June 2003 specifically outlawed the placement of children into <b>restavek</b> service. [...] The law states that a child in domestic service must be treated in the same manner as the biological children of the family; however it does not contain any criminal sanctions for those who violate its provisions. Despite the enactment of these laws, the practice of <b>restavek</b> persists and grows. Political instability and lack of resources hinder efforts to curtail trafficking in children.|$|E
500|$|There {{are also}} {{structural}} factors {{outside of the}} individual that explain the persistence of modern day slavery in Haiti. The US state department's Trafficking in Persons report has identified the following eight structural {{factors that contribute to}} human trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean: (1) the high demand for domestic servants, agricultural laborers, sex workers, and factory labor; (2) political, social, or economic crises, as well as natural disasters such as the January 2010 earthquake; (3) lingering machismo (chauvinistic attitudes and practices) that tends to lead to discrimination against women and girls; (4) existence of established trafficking networks with sophisticated recruitment methods; (5) public corruption, especially complicity between law enforcement and border agents with traffickers and smugglers of people; (6) restrictive immigration policies in some destination countries that have limited the opportunities for legal migration flows to occur; (7) government disinterest in the issue of human trafficking; and (8) limited economic opportunities for women. [...] The <b>restavek</b> tradition is perpetuated by widespread tolerance for the practice throughout Haiti. [...] Other contributing factors to the <b>restavek</b> system include poverty and lack of access to contraception, education, and employment in the countryside. Poor rural families with many children have few opportunities to feed and educate them, leaving few options other than servitude in the city.|$|E
5000|$|As {{poverty and}} {{political}} turmoil increase, the reported number of <b>restaveks</b> {{continues to rise}} dramatically. [...] In 2009, the Pan American Development Foundation published the findings of an extensive door-to-door survey conducted in several cities in Haiti, focused on <b>restaveks.</b> The findings document thousands of <b>restaveks</b> living in Haiti. The report also found that 11% of households who have <b>restaveks</b> working for them also send their own children to work as <b>restaveks</b> for someone else.|$|R
5000|$|The {{estimates}} for numbers of <b>restaveks</b> in Haiti range from 100,000 to 500,000. [...] A 2002 door-to-door survey found {{the number of}} <b>restaveks</b> under age 17 in Haiti to be 173,000, 59 percent of them girls.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Restaveks</b> who {{are young}} and female are {{particularly}} likely to be victimized sexually. Female <b>restaveks</b> are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "la pou sa" [...] which translates to [...] "there for that"—'that' being the sexual pleasure of the males of the family with whom they are staying. <b>Restaveks</b> who become pregnant are often thrown out onto the street. Those who are thrown out or who run away are at risk of becoming homeless or being forced into prostitution.|$|R
500|$|Families {{send the}} {{children}} into other households, exchanging their labor for upbringing. [...] Impoverished rural parents hope {{for education and}} {{a better life for}} their children in the city, sending them to wealthier (or at least less poor) households. Increasingly, children enter domestic servitude when a parent dies. [...] Paid middlemen may act as recruiters, fetching the children for the host families. [...] Unlike slaves in the traditional sense, restaveks are not bought or sold or owned, could run away or return to their families, and are typically released from servitude when they become adults; however, the <b>restavek</b> system is commonly understood to be a form of slavery.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} has made efforts to prevent and reduce human trafficking. In June 2012, the IBESR (Institut du BienEtre Social et de Recherches) launched a human trafficking hotline and conducted a campaign to raise public awareness about child labor, child trafficking, and child sexual abuse. [...] The government made a hotline to report cases of abuse of restaveks. In December 2012, the government created a national commission for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor, which involved launching a public awareness campaign on child labor, and highlighting the national day against <b>restavek</b> abuse. [...] In early 2013, the government created an inter-ministerial working group on human trafficking, chaired by the Judicial Affairs Director of the foreign affairs ministry, to coordinate all anti-trafficking executive branch initiatives.|$|E
500|$|Although a {{majority}} of the modern day slavery cases in Haiti are due to the practice of the <b>restavek</b> system, trafficking for Sexual exploitation in Haiti [...] is a widespread and pressing issue. [...] In recent years, Haiti has become a magnet for sex tourists. [...] Sex slavery includes the practices of coercion, forced prostitution, and trafficking for any sexual purposes. Sheldon Zhang defines sex trafficking as “migrants [...] are transported with the intent to perform sexual services...and in which the smuggling process is enabled through the use of force, fraud, or coercion.” Most victims are trafficked for prostitution, but others are used for pornography and stripping. Children tend to be trafficked within their own countries, while young women may be trafficked internally or internationally, sometimes with the consent of their husbands or other family members.|$|E
5000|$|A 2009 study {{reported}} that up to 225,000 Haitian children are forced to work as domestic servants, and are at grave risk of rape {{at the hands of}} their captors. The children, known as <b>restaveks,</b> are traded into other households by their families, exchanging the children's labor for upbringing. Two thirds of <b>restaveks</b> are female, and most of them come from very poor families and are given to better-off ones. <b>Restaveks</b> who are young and female are particularly likely to be victimized sexually. [...] Female <b>restaveks</b> are sometimes referred to as [...] "la pou sa" [...] which translates to [...] "there for that"—'that' being the sexual pleasure of the males of the family with whom they are staying.|$|R
5000|$|Many parents {{send their}} {{children}} to be <b>restaveks</b> expecting them to have a better life. [...] Poor rural parents who cannot provide their children with clean water, food, and education send them away, usually to cities, to find these opportunities as <b>restaveks.</b>|$|R
50|$|A 2009 study {{reported}} that up to 225,000 Haitian children are forced to work as domestic servants, and are at grave risk of rape {{at the hands of}} their captors. The children, known as <b>restaveks,</b> are traded into other households by their families, exchanging the children's labor for upbringing. A 2012 report placed the number of <b>restaveks</b> in Haiti at between 150,000 and 500,000. Two thirds of <b>restaveks</b> are female, and most of them come from very poor families and are given to better-off ones.|$|R
500|$|The term <b>restavek</b> {{comes from}} the French [...] "to live with", rester avec. [...] The {{practice}} {{has been around since}} the end of the revolution but became common in the 20th century as a way for rural people to cope with poverty. The number of restaveks increased after the 2010 earthquake, when many children became orphans or were separated from their families. The US Department of State estimated in 2013 that between 150,000 and 500,000 children were in domestic servitude, accounting for most of Haiti’s human trafficking. [...] About 19% of Haitian children ages 5 to 17 live away from their parents, and about 8.2% are considered domestic workers. [...] In one survey, restaveks were present in 5.3% of households by their heads' own admission. [...] In one study, 16% of Haitian children surveyed admitted to being restaveks. [...] It is estimated that an additional 3,000 Haitian children are domestic servants in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
500|$|Some restaveks do receive proper {{nutrition}} and education, {{but they are}} in the minority. [...] Restaveks' labor includes hauling water and wood, grocery shopping, laundry, house cleaning, and childcare. [...] Restaveks work long hours (commonly 10 to 14 a day) under harsh conditions, are frequently denied schooling, and are at severe risk of mal{{nutrition and}} verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. [...] Beatings are a daily occurrence for most restaveks, and most of the girls are sexually abused, [...] which puts them at an elevated risk for HIV infection. Those who are thrown out or run away from their host homes become street children, vulnerable to exploitation including forced prostitution. [...] Those who return to their families may be unwelcome as an added economic burden or shamed and stigmatized for having been a <b>restavek.</b> [...] The trauma of abuse and the deprivation of free time and normal childhood experiences can stunt a child's development and have long-lasting effects.|$|E
500|$|The Haitians at gravest risk {{of victimization}} by human traffickers are its poorest people, {{particularly}} children. In Haiti, the poorest {{country in the}} western hemisphere, over half the population lives on less than {{a dollar a day}} and over three quarters live on less than two dollars a day. [...] Severe poverty, compiled with a lack of social services such as education and basic healthcare increases a child’s vulnerability to modern slavery. [...] Factors that increase a child's likelihood of becoming a <b>restavek</b> include illness or loss of one or both parents, lack of access to clean water, lack of educational opportunities, and having access to family in a city. [...] In addition to poverty, individual factors that can lead to exploitation include unemployment, illiteracy, poor educational opportunities, a history of physical or sexual abuse, homelessness, and drug abuse. These individual factors “push” people towards pathways of human trafficking and modern day slavery. Oftentimes men, women and children accept slave-like work conditions because there is little hope for better and they need to survive. Some cross national borders in search of positive opportunities, but instead find themselves a part of the exploited work force. [...] Additionally, factors that make people easy targets for traffickers make enslavement more likely. [...] One group at high risk for sexual enslavement and other types of forced labor is internally displaced persons, particularly women and children living in refugee camps, [...] which offer little security. [...] The estimated 10% of undocumented Haitians, whose births go unreported, are at especial risk of enslavement.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Haitian {{children}} {{who live and}} work away from home as unpaid servants are known as <b>restavèks.</b> This phenomenon is widespread in Haiti, and the children involved are exposed to a range of physical and psychological risk factors as well as limited school attendance. While previous research has explored the experience of <b>restavèks</b> and the opinion of experts on the issue, little research has provided detailed information on the experience and motivations of the biological families of child servants as well as the families that host them. The intention {{of this study was to}} shed light on the sending and receiving families in an effort to better understand the root causes of the system. Additionally, the study sought to understand the policies and programs that exist to address these causes and to provide additional information on children’s working conditions...|$|R
5000|$|Efforts {{exist to}} address {{the root cause of}} child servitude. Improving the economy, {{especially}} through government support for the rural population, would undermine parents’ incentive to give children up, as would an improved health care and education system. [...] Parents would not be as easily pressured by recruiters to hand their children over to become <b>restaveks</b> if they were provided with aid such as food, clothing, and clean water.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{organizations}} in Haiti, such as <b>Restavek</b> Freedom Alliance, BEM Inc. are also actively working in south-western Haiti with <b>restavek</b> children. [...] Organizations {{such as the}} Center for Action and Development (CAD) and L'Escale in Port-au-Prince exist to house, feed, and give medical and psychological care to escaped restaveks while looking to send {{them back to their}} families.|$|E

5000|$|Slavery {{has existed}} in Haiti since Columbus first {{landed on the}} island in 1492. Haiti proclaimed {{independence}} in 1804. [...] France applied several rigid fines and prevented Haiti from accessing international resources, [...] putting a heavy burden on Haiti's economy that detracted from social spending for many years. [...] The <b>restavek</b> tradition dates back centuries. Following the 2010 earthquake, thousands of individuals in Haiti were displaced {{from their homes and}} families. According to anecdotal evidence many of these individuals were children who would have nowhere to turn but to fall into the Haitian <b>restavèk</b> population. Along with displacement due to the occurrences of natural disasters, children are also highly recruited into becoming restavèk’s by recruiters looking to find domestic servants for families. Many street children are former domestic servants who were dismissed by the families in which they worked for, or that they ran away from. However, these children have not yet escaped the <b>restavèk</b> life, instead are shifting into a different dimension of it that include their exploitation in begging rings, and prostitution.|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>restaveks</b> do receive proper {{nutrition}} and education, {{but they are}} in the minority.According to the Pan American Development Foundation, [...] "Education is also an important indicator in detecting child domesticity. Children in domesticity may or may not attend school, but when they do attend, it is generally an inferior school compared to other children... and their rates of non-enrollment are higher than non-restavèk children in the home." ...|$|R
50|$|Unpaid labour {{is still}} a {{practice}} in Haiti. As many as half a million children are unpaid domestic servants called <b>restaveks,</b> who routinely suffer physical and sexual abuse. Additionally, human trafficking, including child trafficking is a significant problem in Haiti; trafficked people are brought into, out of, and through Haiti for forced labor, including sex trafficking. The groups most at risk include the poor, women, children, the homeless, and people migrating across the border with the Dominican Republic. The devastating earthquake in 2010 displaced many, rendering them homeless, isolated, and supremely vulnerable to exploitation by traffickers. The chaos following the quake also distracted authorities and hindered efforts to stop trafficking. The government has taken steps to prevent and stop trafficking, ratifying human rights conventions and enacting laws to protect the vulnerable, but enforcement remains difficult.|$|R
40|$|In 2012, Haiti made a {{moderate}} advancement {{in efforts to}} eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Haiti created a National Commission for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor; established an interministerial working group on trafficking; and expanded the national child protection database to include categories of vulnerable children, including <b>restaveks.</b> The Government also continued to improve access to education by enrolling an additional 200, 000 students during the 2012 school year. Despite these efforts, the Government of Haiti continues to lack adequate legislation to address the worst forms of child labor. The Labor Code provides no minimum age restriction for domestic work, which leaves children vulnerable to working in the sector. There are also gaps in the Act of 2003, which prohibits the use of children in forced labor, commercial sexual exploitation, illicit activities, and hazardous work, but does not contain penalties for such crimes. Legislation on trafficking has been pending in Parliament for several years, but {{has yet to be}} passed. Social protection programs to combat exploitative child labor are also insufficient. Children in Haiti continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, particularly in domestic service and dangerous forms of agriculture...|$|R
5000|$|Jean-Robert Cadet vividly recounted {{his life}} as a <b>restavek.</b> According to him, a term for {{children}} staying with host families who do not abuse them is timoun ki rete kay moun (Kreyol for [...] "child who stays in a person's house.") ...|$|E

5000|$|Two {{major factors}} that {{perpetuate}} the <b>restavek</b> system are widespread poverty and a societal {{acceptance of the}} practice. [...] Parents who cannot provide for their children continue {{to send them to}} be restaveks. Haiti, a nation of 10 million people, is the most poverty-stricken in the western hemisphere. [...] Guerda Lexima-Constant, a child rights advocate with the Haitian Limyè Lavi Foundation, says: [...] "I have yet to meet anyone who wanted to send their kid to be a <b>restavek.</b> Parents are forced to because of a lot of national and international givens. The economic means they used to have, they don’t anymore. The invasion of foreign rice, eggs, and other things on the market by big business, destroying the peasant economy... there’s been a whole chain of events that makes some people have to send their child away." ...|$|E
5000|$|Individual {{factors that}} {{increase}} a child's likelihood {{of becoming a}} <b>restavek</b> include {{lack of access to}} clean water, lack of educational opportunities, access to family in a city, and illness or loss of one or both parents. [...] Haiti has too few orphanages for its abundance of orphans, putting them at high risk of becoming restaveks.|$|E
5000|$|About {{two thirds}} of restaveks are girls, a large {{proportion}} of whom suffer sexual abuse at the hands of male household members. However, young males are involved as well. Sexual abuse of restaveks by male household members is societally accepted, and girls are often blamed for their abuse. [...] Often, <b>restavek</b> girls are called la pou sa—there for that—implying that they exist for the purpose of satisfying male household members' sexual desires. Options for seeking help are limited because the children do not have a caretaker with their best interest as a priority, so there is little expectation that anyone will protect them. [...] A 2006 study showed that female restaveks are at a risk 4.5 times higher of being sexually assaulted than their non-restavek cohorts, 9.6% of female restaveks having been sexually abused. The trauma from abuse can affect a former <b>restavek</b> for life.|$|E
