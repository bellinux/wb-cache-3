500|$|Robert H. Marriott was a radio pioneer {{employed}} by the Navy in Puget Sound, where he conducted early experiments with underwater pilot cables. His results were sufficiently promising that he recommended further development to Commander Stanford C. Hooper. [...] In October, 1919 Commander Hooper instructed A. Crossley, an expert <b>radio</b> <b>aid,</b> to develop and test the concept {{on a larger scale}} at the New London Naval Base. Crossley installed a longer version of the cable that Marriott had designed. He used a wooden hulled launch for the first round of tests before moving to a steel-hulled submarine for later tests. Both types of vessel picked up the signal and followed the underwater test cable without problem.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the next}} three days, Willmarth {{screened}} the convoy to its destination — Mapia and Asia Islands, near Morotai — before arriving in the invasion area on the 11th. As the convoy neared Morotai, Willmarth's lookouts observed anti-aircraft fire between 04:15 and 05:30. Two [...] "bogies" [...] passed within four miles (6 km) of the convoy; but, as Wilmarth's war diarist recorded, [...] "evidently they either did not sight us or were not interested, as they proceeded directly toward the area from which flak appeared." [...] There was a reason why Willmarth did not open fire on the two planes that seemed so close — she carried the only reliable air-warning radar in the entire convoy and to open fire prematurely would have disclosed {{the position of the}} little convoy and exposed it to possible air attacks. At 08:32, the destroyer escort anchored just off the southern coast of Morotai, near Ariadne, while the remainder of the convoy (save the LCM's) proceeded {{to another part of the}} island to load for the impending invasion of Mapia and Asia Islands. The mission of the assault group was to establish weather station and LORAN — long range <b>radio</b> <b>aid</b> to navigation — facilities.|$|E
