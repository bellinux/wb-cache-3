40|$|This study investigates {{different}} receive single-branch switch-based diversity {{schemes for}} dual-hop amplify-and-forward relaying networks. Specifically, three receive processing algorithms are adopted, {{in which the}} receive branch is selected using the arbitrary selection algorithm, the switching algorithm, or the switching algorithm with post-examining best branch selection. The identification of the receive branch is carried out for two different system models. For the first model, a single-antenna <b>relaying</b> <b>station</b> is {{used in conjunction with}} a multiple-antenna transceiver, where the processing is performed independently of the first hop-fading conditions. The second model suggests the use of parallel deployment of single-antenna relays to transfer information from a multiple-antenna transmitter to a single-antenna receiver, where the active <b>relaying</b> <b>station</b> is determined based on the pre-combining end-to-end fading conditions. Performance comparisons for various transmission scenarios on the first hop are presented using new formulations for the statistics of the combined signal-to-noise ratio.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} the {{hand-off}} {{performance of a}} wireless system with heterogeneous technologies called iCAR (Integrated Cellular and Ad hoc Relaying). In iCAR, hand-offs can occur not only from a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) to another BTS, but also from a BTS to a so-called Ad hoc <b>Relaying</b> <b>Station</b> (ARS) {{in the form of}} relaying, as well as from an ARS back to a BTS. The latter two types of hand-offs effectively increase the hand-off buffer time and thus reduce the call dropping probability. We develop an analytical model for the hand-off performance in iCAR. In addition, we verify the analytical model via simulations and quantify the hand-off performance benefits of the iCAR system over conventional cellular systems. It is anticipated that the analytical and simulation models reported in this paper will serve as a guideline to other researches on the inter-system hand-off involving heterogenous wireless technologies...|$|E

40|$|Most {{cellular}} network communication strategies {{are focused on}} data traffic scenarios rather than energy balance and efficient utilization. Thus mobile users in hot cells may suffer from low throughput due to energy loading imbalance problem. In state of art {{cellular network}} technologies, <b>relay</b> <b>stations</b> extend cell coverage and enhance signal strength for mobile users. However, busy traffic makes the <b>relay</b> <b>stations</b> in hot area run out of energy quickly. In this paper, we propose an energy balancing strategy in which the mobile nodes are able to dynamically select and hand over to the <b>relay</b> <b>station</b> with the highest potential energy capacity to resume communication. Key to the strategy is that each <b>relay</b> <b>station</b> merely maintains two parameters that contains the trend of its previous energy consumption and then predicts its future quantity of energy, which {{is defined as the}} <b>relay</b> <b>station</b> potential energy capacity. Then each mobile node can select the <b>relay</b> <b>station</b> with the highest potential energy capacity. Simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly increase the aggregate throughput and the average life time of <b>relay</b> <b>stations</b> in cellular network environment.

40|$|We {{consider}} a multipair decode-and-forward relay channel, where multiple sources transmit simultaneously their signals to multiple destinations {{with the help}} of a full-duplex <b>relay</b> <b>station.</b> We assume that the <b>relay</b> <b>station</b> is equipped with massive arrays, while all sources and destinations have a single antenna. The <b>relay</b> <b>station</b> uses channel estimates obtained from received pilots and zero-forcing (ZF) or maximum-ratio combining/maximum-ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) to process the signals. To reduce significantly the loop interference effect, we propose two techniques: i) using a massive receive antenna array; or ii) using a massive transmit antenna array together with very low transmit power at the <b>relay</b> <b>station.</b> We derive an exact achievable rate in closed-form for MRC/MRT processing and an analytical approximation of the achievable rate for ZF processing. This approximation is very tight, especially for large number of <b>relay</b> <b>station</b> antennas. These closed-form expressions enable us to determine the regions where the full-duplex mode outperforms the half-duplex mode, as well as, to design an optimal power allocation scheme. This optimal power allocation scheme aims to maximize the energy efficiency for a given sum spectral efficiency and under peak power constraints at the <b>relay</b> <b>station</b> and sources. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the optimal power allocation scheme. Furthermore, we show that, by doubling the number of transmit/receive antennas at the <b>relay</b> <b>station,</b> the transmit power of each source and of the <b>relay</b> <b>station</b> can be reduced by 1. 5 dB if the pilot power is equal to the signal power, and by 3 dB if the pilot power is kept fixed, while maintaining a given quality-of-service...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Multihop relay {{networks}} (MR) use <b>relay</b> <b>stations</b> (RS) {{to extend}} or enhance {{the coverage of}} a base station (BS) in a cellular network. The base station {{is attached to a}} wired backhaul. <b>Relay</b> <b>stations</b> use wireless transmission to connect to the base station and to the mobile stations (MS), while direct BS-MS connection is also possible. Low cost relay technologies are recently proposed for OFDM based broadband wireless technologies.
