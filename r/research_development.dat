These are now entering markets {{as a result}} of <b>research,</b> <b>development</b> and demonstration (RD) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.|$|E

It increased agriculture production around the world, especially from the late 1960s. The initiatives, led by Norman Borlaug and credited with saving over a billion people from starvation, involved the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers.|$|E

5|$|Between 1946 and 1949, {{the average}} {{size of the}} design team working on the Mark 1 and its predecessor, the SSEM, had been about four people. During that time 34patents were taken out based on the team's work, either by the Ministry of Supply or by its successor, the National <b>Research</b> <b>Development</b> Corporation. In July 1949, IBM invited Williams to the United States on an all-expenses-paid trip to discuss the Mark 1's design. The company {{subsequently}} licensed several of the patented ideas developed for the machine, including the Williams tube, {{in the design of}} its own 701 and 702 computers. The most significant design legacy of the Manchester Mark 1 was perhaps its incorporation of index registers, the patent for which was taken out in the names of Williams, Kilburn, Tootill, and Newman.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} return, Cockcroft was {{appointed}} Chief Superintendent of the Air Defence <b>Research</b> <b>Development</b> Establishment (ADRDE) at Christchurch, Hampshire. His {{focus was on}} the use of radar for shooting down enemy aircraft. The GL Mk. III radar was developed as a target tracking and predicting radar, but by 1942 the SCR-584 radar developed for the same purpose in the United States became available, and Cockcroft recommended that it be acquired under Lend-Lease. On his own initiative, he acquired SCR-584 sets for testing, and trials conducted on the Isle of Sheppey in October 1943 conclusively demonstrated that SCR-584 was superior. This made Cockcroft very unpopular at the Ministry of Supply, but he had intelligence that the Germans were planning to deploy the V-1 flying bomb. On 1 January 1944, Lieutenant-General Sir Ronald Weeks sent Washington an urgent request for 134 SCR-584 sets.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{background}} of arranging internship entitled "Strategy of the Increasing <b>Research</b> dan <b>Development</b> at Bappeda of Central Java Province", {{is an effort}} to respon strategic environmental change in perspectif of <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> and also the demand of development paradigm change that has emphazise on research activity and develop local development planning procces. In this case, <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> has become a major need that can give alternative in solution of local development. The role of <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> is demandding quality {{that can be used in}} the procces of preparing the planning of local development programs. In the context of increasing the quality of <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> that is done by Bappeda, there are a very complex handicap must be faced. Some problem that must be overcome quickly is a relatively lower quality of the personnal on <b>research</b> and <b>development,</b> the policy of <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> do not refer to five agenda of development at Central Java Provice, lack of authorithy and competence in implementing the function of <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> and also limitation in facility of <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> net sistem that is still by sector. Problems of <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> that is faced by Bappeda need a structuraly and functionaly handling steps through the strategy planning on increasing quality of the <b>research</b> and <b>development.</b> Aims and advantages of this strategy, are emphazised on increasing and developing internal factor of <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> by using external factors thatcan encourage the improvement on <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> quality. It is hoped that the planning of strategy will be one of foundation of policy in increasing <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> quality at Bappeda in the future. In order to analyse strategi planning on increasing reasearch and development quality, it is used SWOT qualitative analisys method. By using Matrix Internal-External mode. From the analisys, can be known the position of <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> of Bappeda at this time is on growth strategy level With the horizontal integration growth strategy alternative. The suitable strategy to implied in this position is by strengthen and developed <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> institution, development of human resources on <b>research</b> and <b>development,</b> reorientation of the <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> policy, and <b>development</b> of <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> net facility. The above strategy must be done completetly united, continuited, and integrated with resources that they are possesed, so a strong sinergy to increase quality of the result of the <b>research</b> and <b>development</b> which support optimalisation of local development plan can be achieved. ...|$|R
