40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{performance}} of modern high-bypass jet engines a promising approach is to replace the low pressure-vane row arranged downstream of a strutted intermediate turbine diffuser (mid turbine frame) by the application of turning struts and to integrate functionalities such as <b>bearing</b> <b>supports,</b> lubrication pipes, engine mounts and aggressive duct designs. Thus the weight may be reduced which results in a lower specific fuel consumption and reduced CO 2 -emissions. The additional functions of the mid turbine frame (MTF) structures lead to constraints like a minimum required strut thickness leading to a maximum possible number of struts. Therefore a highly three-dimensional design of the airfoils and the duct, respectively, is necessary to reduce strong secondary flow effects and further to provide suitable flow angle and Mach number for the following low pressure turbine (LPT). A future area of application for mid turbine frames with turning struts, so-called turning mid turbine frames (TMTF), may also be in direct-drive open-rotor engine architectures.

40|$|Volvo Car Corporation uses a new {{generation}} of four cylinder inline engines in their automobiles. The engine family is known as Volvo Engine Architecture and the differences between the different engines are the different power outputs made possible with different engine boosts. The VEA engines utilise a bedplate design for their engines where the main <b>bearing</b> <b>supports</b> are casted into the bedplate. For the high performance engines the main <b>bearing</b> <b>supports</b> need to be sprayed with an aluminium alloy to get a strong bonding with the bedplate. The spraying is, however, expensive and an alternative solution is sought. Four design proposals, which are based on the current design of the main <b>bearing</b> <b>supports,</b> were proposed. These design proposals does not use any of the sprayed aluminium alloy material. Instead they have been designed with the goal of getting a mechanical bonding, instead of the chemical bonding that the aluminium alloy coating provides. The design proposals were evaluated by static simulations and dynamic simulations to investigate the influence on the main bearings in terms of: • radial deformations of the main bearing profiles, • total pressure and asperity contact pressure and • friction losses. The contact behaviour between the bedplate and the main <b>bearing</b> <b>supports,</b> for the different design proposals, at high temperature were also investigated. The results from the simulations were compared to results from earlier work on the sprayed main <b>bearing</b> <b>supports.</b> None of the design proposals generally provided lower friction losses compared to the sprayed main <b>bearing</b> <b>support.</b> The differences in friction loss should also by weighed against the potential cost saving, which is a question for VCC. The sprayed main <b>bearing</b> <b>supports</b> showed in general higher asperity contact pressure compared to the design proposals. Most of the bonding between the bedplate and the main <b>bearing</b> <b>supports</b> occurred on the top surfaces and the sides of the main <b>bearing</b> <b>supports</b> for the different design proposals. An investigation of getting fatigue failure in the bedplate should also be considered, if VCC should proceed with {{one or more of the}} design proposals.

40|$|The {{demand for}} silent rolling bearing applications, such as {{electric}} motors and gearboxes, {{has resulted in}} an investigation of viscoelastic <b>bearing</b> <b>supports.</b> By placing a thin viscoelastic layer between the bearing outer ring and the surrounding structure, vibrations of the shaft-bearing arrangement can be isolated and damped {{in such a way}} that the radiated sound power is reduced. The ultimate goal of this research was to develop a design strategy for viscoelastic <b>bearing</b> <b>supports</b> resulting in an effective noise reduction. This thesis describes the dynamic and acoustic behaviour of rolling bearing applications with viscoelastic <b>bearing</b> <b>supports.</b> Ultimately, the investigations cover a wide range of aspects in mechanical engineering: (1) the description of viscoelastic material behaviour; (2) development of a new Component Mode Synthesis method for viscoelastic components; (3) experimental investigations into the mechanical properties of viscoelastic materials; (4) development of advanced structural models of rotor dynamics applications; (5) numerical and experimental investigations of the dynamic and acoustic behaviour of an electric motor; (6) development of a design strategy for noise reduction by viscoelastic <b>bearing</b> <b>supports</b> In the present research, elastic components, like the shaft or the housing, and the viscoelastic support are modelled with the finite element method. In addition, the models are reduced by Component Mode Synthesis to save computation time. Viscoelasticity is described by a generalised Maxwell representation suitable for both time and frequency domain analyses. Viscoelastic materials are measured on a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer to obtain the frequency dependent stiffness and damping characteristics. The viscoelastic modelling approach is succesfully validated at a component level with sandwich rings. The results showed that a significant amount of damping can be created by the viscoelastic layer. As a next step, numerical and experimental studies were performed on a rotor dynamics test rig. A clear vibration reduction was achieved with viscoelastic supports, especially for high running speeds. Subsequently, the dynamic and acoustic behaviour of a running electric motor was analysed. The acoustic analysis was based on the boundary element method using so-called radiation modes. The agreement between experimental and numerical results was satisfactory in the noisiest frequency range from 1000 to 2500 Hz. It was found that the sound power level of the electric motor can be reduced by 3 to 5 dB(A) with a viscoelastic <b>bearing</b> <b>support.</b> Finally, a strategy is proposed for designing noise reducing viscoelastic <b>bearing</b> <b>supports.</b> A set of qualitative design rules and a more quantitative design approach are presented...|$|R
