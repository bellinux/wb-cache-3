5000|$|<b>Racecadotril,</b> {{also known}} as acetorphan, is an {{antidiarrheal}} drug which acts as a peripherally acting enkephalinase inhibitor. Unlike other opioid medications used to treat diarrhea, which reduce intestinal motility, <b>racecadotril</b> has an [...] effect—it reduces the secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestine. It is available in France (where it was first introduced in ~1990) and other European countries (including Germany, Italy, the UK, Spain and the Czech Republic) {{as well as most}} of South America and some South East Asian countries (including China, India and Thailand), but not in the United States. It is sold under the tradenames Hidrasec or, in France, Tiorfan. In Italy it is sold under the tradename Tiorfix.|$|E
50|$|An {{enkephalinase}} inhibitor {{is a type}} of {{enzyme inhibitor}} which inhibits one or more members of the enkephalinase class of enzymes that break down the endogenous enkephalin opioid peptides. Examples include <b>racecadotril,</b> ubenimex (bestatin), RB-101, and D-phenylalanine, as well as the endogenous opioid peptides opiorphin and spinorphin. Analgesic, anticraving, antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antidiarrheal effects are common properties of enkephalinase inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the more}} {{commonly}} used enkephalinase inhibitor <b>racecadotril,</b> which only acts peripherally and has antidiarrheal effects, RB-101 is able to enter the brain, and thus produces a range of effects, acting as an analgesic, anxiolytic and antidepressant. The antidepressant and anxiolytic actions {{are thought to be}} mediated through the delta opioid receptor, while the analgesic effects most likely result from a mix of mu and delta activity. Animal studies suggest that RB-101 is also likely to be useful in relieving the symptoms of acute opioid withdrawal and in the management of opioid dependence.|$|E
5000|$|Ecadotril is {{a neutral}} endopeptidase {{inhibitor}} ((NEP) EC 3.4.24.11) and {{determined by the}} presence of peptidase family M13 as a neutral endopeptidase inhibited by phosphoramidon. Ecadotril is the (S)-enantiomer of <b>racecadotril.</b> NEP-like enzymes include the endothelin-converting enzymes. [...] The peptidase M13 family believed to activate or inactivate oligopeptide (pro)-hormones such as opioid peptides, neprilysin [...] is another member of this group, {{in the case of the}} metallopeptidases and aspartic, the nucleophiles clan or family for example MA, is an activated water molecule. The peptidase domain for members of this family also contains a bacterial member and resembles that of thermolysin the predicted active site residues for members of this family and thermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH. Thermolysin complexed with the inhibitor (S)-thiorphan are isomeric thiol-containing inhibitors of endopeptidase EC 24-11 (also called [...] "enkephalinase").|$|E
40|$|<b>Racecadotril</b> is a guideline-recommended {{treatment}} to alleviate symptoms of acute diarrhea. A systematic review of randomized studies was performed comparing efficacy {{and safety of}} treatment with <b>racecadotril</b> to that with placebo or active treatments in adults. In five double-blind studies, <b>racecadotril</b> and placebo had comparable tolerability but <b>racecadotril</b> was more effective. This was consistent across multiple efficacy parameters including duration of diarrhea, number of diarrheic stools, abdominal pain and meteorism; it was also consistent across countries in Africa, Asia and Europe. In six randomized studies in outpatients comparing <b>racecadotril</b> to loperamide, resolution of symptoms occurred with similar speed and efficacy; however, <b>racecadotril</b> treatment was associated with less rebound constipation and less abdominal discomfort. A seventh comparative study performed in geriatric nursing home residents reported a superior efficacy of <b>racecadotril.</b> In direct comparison with Saccharomyces boulardii treatment, <b>racecadotril</b> exhibited similar tolerability but was more efficacious. One study compared <b>racecadotril</b> to octreotide in patients with acute diarrhea requiring hospitalization, rehydration and antibiotic treatment; in this cohort, octreotide was more efficacious than <b>racecadotril.</b> In conclusion, in adults with acute diarrhea <b>racecadotril</b> is more efficacious than placebo or Saccharomyces boulardii, similarly efficacious as loperamide and, in patients with moderate to severe disease as add-on to antibiotics, less than octreotide. The tolerability of <b>racecadotril</b> {{is similar to that}} of placebo or Saccharomyces boulardii and better than that of loperamide, particularly with regard to risk of rebound constipation. Taken together these data demonstrate that <b>racecadotril</b> is a suitable {{treatment to}} alleviate symptoms of acute diarrhea in adults...|$|E
40|$|<b>Racecadotril,</b> via its active {{metabolite}} thiorphan, is an inhibitor of {{the enzyme}} neutral endopeptidase (NEP, EC 3. 4. 24. 11), thereby increasing exposure to NEP including enkephalins and atrial natriuretic peptide. Upon oral administration <b>racecadotril</b> is rapidly and effectively converted into the active metabolite thiorphan, {{which does not}} cross the blood-brain-barrier. <b>Racecadotril</b> has mainly been tested in animal models and patients of three therapeutic areas. As an analgesic the effects of <b>racecadotril</b> across animal models were inconsistent. In cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension or congestive heart failure results from animal studies were promising, probably related to increased exposure to atrial natriuretic peptide, but clinical results have not shown substantial therapeutic benefit over existing treatment options in cardiovascular disease. In contrast, <b>racecadotril</b> was consistently effective in animal models and patients with various forms of acute diarrhea by inhibiting pathologic (but not basal) secretion from the gut without changing gastro-intestinal transit time or motility. This included studies in both adults and children. In direct comparative studies with loperamide in adults and children, <b>racecadotril</b> was at least as effective but exhibited fewer adverse events in most studies, particularly less rebound constipation. Several guidelines recommend the use of <b>racecadotril</b> as addition to oral rehydration treatment in children with acute diarrhea...|$|E

40|$|Aim Our aim was {{to compare}} the {{efficacy}} and tolerability of loperamide and <b>racecadotril</b> in elderly patients with acute diarrhea. Research design and methods We performed a randomized, prospective, double-blind, and parallel group design implemented in geriatric nursing homes in Catanzaro, Italy, from February 2008 to March 2009. Patients of both sexes were randomly allocated to receive either one tablet of <b>racecadotril</b> 100 mg every 8 h or two tablets of loperamide 2. 0 mg followed by one tablet after each unformed stool, up to four tablets in any 24 - h period. Patients were treated until recovery, defined as the production of two consecutive normal stools or no stool production {{for a period of}} 12 h. Results Normal stools were collected 36 +/- 4 h after the beginning of <b>racecadotril</b> and in 63 +/- 6 h from the beginning of loperamide administration (P< 0. 01). The median time of abdominal pain in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 14 h for <b>racecadotril</b> and 28 h for loperamide. In the perprotocol (PP) population, the median time of abdominal pain was 14 h for <b>racecadotril</b> and 32 h for loperamide (P< 0. 01). About the 50 % of patients experienced at least one adverse event during the study: 12 % in the <b>racecadotril</b> group and 60 % in the loperamide group. The most frequently occurring adverse events were nausea and constipation. Genetic analysis did not report the presence of rapid or poor metabolizers. Pharmacoeconomic analysis performed {{at the end of our}} study documented an increase in costs in the loperamide group with respect to the <b>racecadotril</b> group (P< 0. 01). Conclusions <b>Racecadotril</b> is more effective than loperamide-probably due to drug interaction with loperamide-and it is not related to pharmacogenetic susceptibility. <b>Racecadotril</b> is also more cost effective than loperamide...|$|E

Objective: To evaluate the cost utility of <b>racecadotril</b> adjuvant with oral rehydration solution (ORS) compared to ORS alone for the treatment of AWD in children younger than 5 years old. The analysis is performed from a United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) perspective. Methods: A decision tree model has been developed in Microsoft&reg; Excel. The model is populated with the best available evidence. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) have been performed. Health effects are measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the model output is cost (2011 GBP) per QALY. The uncertainty in the primary outcome is explored by probabilistic analysis using 1000 iterations of a Monte Carlo simulation. Results: Deterministic analysis results in a total incremental cost of &ndash;&pound; 379 in favor of <b>racecadotril</b> and a total incremental QALY gain in favor of <b>racecadotril</b> of + 0. 0008. The observed cost savings with <b>racecadotril</b> arise from the reduction in primary care reconsultation and secondary referral. The difference in QALYs is largely attributable to the timely resolution of symptoms in the <b>racecadotril</b> arm. <b>Racecadotril</b> remains dominant when base case parameters are varied. Monte Carlo simulation and PSA confirm that <b>racecadotril</b> is the dominant treatment strategy and is almost certainly cost effective, under the central assumptions of the model, at a commonly used willingness to pay proxy threshold range of &pound; 20, 000 &ndash;&pound; 30, 000 per QALY.

40|$|Background: Diarrhoeal {{disease is}} the second most common cause of death in {{children}} under 5 years of age in Kenya. Treatment with Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), elemental zinc and continued feeding (as recommended by the World Health Organisation) led to a significant reduction in mortality in the 1970 s and 1980 s, which has slowed since then. Adjunctive treatments have however, not gained much popularity either due to modest improvements in morbidity and mortality or unacceptable adverse effect profiles. <b>Racecadotril,</b> an enkephalinase inhibitor, has been used for over 2 decades in parts of Europe but is only recently gaining recognition {{in other parts of the}} world. No trials have been done testing its efficacy compared with the standard treatment recommended by the WHO (i. e. the combination of ORS and Zinc). This study aimed to measure the efficacy of <b>racecadotril</b> in the treatment of acute severe gastroenteritis disease in children admitted to hospital and on zinc. Objectives: The primary objective was to compare the number of stools in the first 48 hours in children admitted with severe acute gastroenteritis treated with either <b>Racecadotril</b> or placebo. The secondary objectives were: to study the impact of <b>Racecadotril</b> on duration of inpatient stay as well as duration of illness in children admitted with severe acute gastroenteritis, and to describe the side effect profile of <b>Racecadotril.</b> Methods: This was a parallel randomised double blinded placebo controlled trial. It enrolled children between the age of 3 and 60 months of age who were admitted to hospital with severe acute gastroenteritis as evidenced by a Vesikari score of greater than 11. Children who fulfilled the criteria for inclusion were enrolled after informed consent had been obtained from their parents/guardians. They were then randomised to receive either <b>racecadotril</b> or placebo in addition to the standard treatment prescribed by the admitting physicians. These children were followed up daily for: the number of stools for the first 48 hrs, duration of admission, duration of illness and any adverse effects noted by the accompanying parents/guardians. The results were analysed by comparing the median number of stools using the Mann Whitney test. Results: 156 children were screened, from which 120 were enrolled for the study and a final number of 58 in the placebo group and 57 in the drug group were analysed by intention to treat. There were no differences between the two groups when the numbers of stools at 48 hours after introduction of the drug were compared: median (IQR) of 5 (3 - 7) and 5 (2. 5 – 7. 5) respectively, p value 0. 63. On studying the duration of inpatient stay, this was also similar: drug group median (IQR) : 4 days (1. 5 - 6. 5) and placebo group 4. 5 (1. 8 – 6. 3), p value 0. 71. The same was noted on comparing the duration of illness: 3 days (2 - 4) and 2 days (1 - 3), p value 0. 77). Adverse events occurred in 14 subjects in both groups. The relative risk of a severe adverse event was 3. 0 fold higher in the drug group but not statistically significant (95 % CI 0. 63 – 14. 7) p value 0. 16. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study the impact of <b>Racecadotril</b> on the number of stools at 48 hours, duration of hospital stay and diarrhoea was not significant. <b>Racecadotril,</b> therefore, cannot be recommended as an adjunct for the treatment of severe acute gastroenteritis in children admitted to hospital and treated with ORS and Zinc...|$|E

Methods: A cost utility model has been adapted to the context of Thailand to evaluate <b>racecadotril</b> plus oral rehydration solution (R+ORS) versus oral rehydration solution (ORS) alone for acute diarrhea in children < 5 years old. The decision tree Excel model evaluates the costs and effects (quality-adjusted life years) over a 6 -day time horizon from a public health care payer’s perspective in Thailand. Deterministic sensitivity analysis and budget impact analysis have been undertaken. Results: According to the cost utility model, the intervention (R+ORS) is less costly and more effective than the comparator (ORS) for the base case with a dominant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of − 2, 481, 390 ฿ for the intervention. According to the budget impact analysis (assuming an increase of 5 % market share for R+ORS over 5 years), the year-on-year reduction for diarrhea {{as a percentage of the}} total health care expenditure is − 0. 0027 %, resulting in potential net cost savings of − 35, 632, 482 ฿ over 5 years.

40|$|Acute {{diarrhoea}} is {{a leading}} cause of child mortality in developing countries. Principal pathogens include Escherichia coli, rotaviruses, and noroviruses. 90 % of diarrhoeal deaths are attributable to inadequate sanitation. Acute diarrhoea is the second leading cause of overall childhood mortality and accounts for 18 % of deaths among children under five. In 2004 an estimated 1. 5 million children died from diarrhoea, with 80 % of deaths occurring before the age of two. Treatment goals are to prevent dehydration and nutritional damage and to reduce duration and severity of diarrhoeal episodes. The recommended therapeutic regimen is to provide oral rehydration solutions (ORS) and to continue feeding. Although ORS effectively mitigates dehydration, it has no effect on the duration, severity, or frequency of diarrhoeal episodes. Adjuvant therapy with micronutrients, probiotics, or antidiarrhoeal agents may thus be useful. The WHO recommends the use of zinc tablets in association with ORS. The ESPGHAN/ESPID treatment guidelines consider the use of <b>racecadotril,</b> diosmectite, or probiotics as possible adjunctive therapy to ORS.

40|$|The colon is {{actively}} implicated in intestinal infections {{not only as}} a target of enteric pathogens and their products but also as a target organ for treatment. In the presence of diarrhea, both of osmotic and secretory nature, the colon reacts with homeostatic mechanisms to increase ion absorption. These mechanisms can be effectively exploited to decrease fluid discharge. A model of intestinal infections using rotavirus (RV) in colonic cells was set up and used to define a dual model of secretory and osmotic diarrhea in sequence. Using this model, antidiarrheal drugs were tested, namely zinc and the enkephalinase inhibitor <b>racecadotril.</b> Zinc was able to decrease the enterotoxic activity responsible for secretory diarrhea. It also inhibited the cytotoxic effect of RV. The mechanism of zinc was related at least in part to the activation of MAPK activity, but also a direct antiviral effect was observed. <b>Racecadotril</b> showed a potent and selective inhibition of active secretion, being particularly effective in the first phase of RV diarrhea. The use of drugs active at the colonic level, therefore, offers effective options to treat intestinal infections in childhood. In addition, the colon is the natural site of colonic microflora, a target of probiotic therapy, which is the first line of approach recommended by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition to treat infectious diarrhea...|$|E

40|$|Diarrhoea {{is the one}} of {{the most}} common cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in many developing countries effecting mainly the infants and children’s. There are many synthetic drug treatments for diarrhoea like loperamide, bismuth subsalicylate and <b>racecadotril.</b> But these drugs have more side effects like nausea, abdominal discomfort, headache etc. Many herbal plants available which have anti-diarrhoeal activity with lesser side-effects than the conventional drugs. The review focuses on the various plants which have been proved for their anti-diarrhoeal activity in experimental animal models. This review also focused the in-vivo animal models such as castor oil induced diarrhoea, gastrointestinal motility test, magnesium sulphate induced diarrhoea and serotonin induced diarrhoea...|$|E
40|$|Two {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric methods (A and B) for {{the determination of}} <b>racecadotril</b> in bulk drugs and pharmaceutical formulations are described. In method A, methanol was used as solvent and shows absorption maximum at 231 nm. In method B, the solvent used was acetonitrile:water in the ratio of 1 : 3 and shows absorption maximum at 232 nm. The Beer&#x 2032;s law range for method A is 25 - 100 mg/ml and 20 - 80 mg/ml for method B. When capsules dosage forms were analyzed, the results obtained by the proposed methods are in good agreement with the labeled amounts {{and the results were}} validated statistically...|$|E
30|$|Another {{important}} step toward clinical translation is {{the assessment of}} biosafety and efficacy of the NEP inhibitor intended for human application. It {{should be noted that}} so far, no extensive toxicity studies have been reported for PA. This bacterial origin and potent NEP inhibitor has been administered in human only in homeopathic amounts [16, 20]. Consequently, we decided to compare the in vivo efficacy of the clinically certified NEP inhibitor thiorphan (TO) [21, 22] vs. PA to enhance the tumor uptake of [111 In-DOTA]MG 11 in the same mouse model. <b>Racecadotril</b> (Race) is a prodrug of TO administered orally and a registered antidiarrheal drug (Fig.  1) [23, 24], which has also been included in our study. Race was administered intraperitoneally (ip) due to its poor water solubility prior to [111 In-DOTA]MG 11 iv injection.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{propranolol}} {{was suggested}} to prevent hyperlactatemia {{in a child}} with hypovolemic shock through β-adrenergic blockade. Though it is a known inhibitor of glycolysis, propranolol, outside this observation, has never been reported to fully protect against lactate overproduction. On the other hand, literature evidence exists for a cross-talk between β-adrenergic receptors (protein targets of propranolol) and δ-opioid receptor. In this literature context, it is hypothesized here that anti-diarrheic <b>racecadotril</b> (a pro-drug of thiorphan, an inhibitor of enkephalinases), which, in the cited observation, was co-administered with propranolol, might have facilitated the β-blocker-driven inhibition of glycolysis and resulting lactate production. The opioid-facilitated β-adrenergic blockade would be essentially additivity or even synergism putatively existing between antagonism of β-adrenergic receptors and agonism of δ-opioid receptor in lowering cellular cAMP and dependent functions...|$|E
30|$|We have {{recently}} shown that treatment of mice with the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA) improves the bioavailability and tumor uptake of biodegradable radiopeptides. For the truncated gastrin radiotracer [111 In-DOTA]MG 11 ([(DOTA)DGlu 10]gastrin(10 – 17)), this method led to impressively high tumor-to-kidney ratios. Translation {{of this concept}} in the clinic {{requires the use of}} certified NEP inhibitors, such as thiorphan (TO) and its orally administered prodrug <b>racecadotril</b> (Race). Besides NEP, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has also been implicated in the catabolism of gastrin analogs. In the present study, we first compared the effects induced by NEP inhibition (using PA, TO, or Race) and/or by ACE inhibition (using lisinopril, Lis) on the biodistribution profile of [111 In-DOTA]MG 11 in mice. In addition, we compared the efficacy of PA and TO at different administered doses to enhance tumor uptake.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Acute {{diarrhea}} {{remains a}} major problem in children and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and costs. While vaccination against rotavirus could reduce the burden of the disease, the persistent impact of intestinal infections requires effective treatment in adjunct to oral rehydration solutions, to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhea. Several therapeutic options have been proposed for acute diarrhea, but proof of efficacy is available for few of them, including zinc, diosmectite, selected probiotics and <b>racecadotril.</b> However, at present there is no universal drug, and therapeutic efficacy has only been shown for selected drugs in selected settings, such as: outpatients/inpatients, developed/developing countries and viral/bacterial etiology. AREAS COVERED: This narrative review reports the opinions of experts from different countries of the world who have discussed strategies to improve the management of diarrhea. EXPERT OPINION: More data are needed to optimize the management of diarrhea and highlight the research priorities at a global level; such priorities include improved recommendations on oral rehydration solution composition, and the reevaluation of therapeutic options in the light of new trials. Therapeutic strategies need to be assessed in different settings, and pharmacoeconomic analyses based on country-specific data are needed. Transfer to clinical practice should result from the implementation of guidelines tailored at a local level, with an eye on costs...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{diarrhea}} is a {{major cause}} of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Infants and pre-school children are the most vulnerable in whom there are 2 – 3 million deaths each year {{as a result of the}} associated dehydration and acidosis. Although oral rehydration therapy has reduced mortality during the past 30 years ago, the search for agents that will directly inhibit intestinal secretory mechanisms and thereby reduce faecal losses in patients with high-volume watery diarrhea has continued for more than 20 years. A variety of potential targets for antisecretory agents have been explored which include loci within the enterocyte (the chloride channel, calcium-calmodulin) and other sites such as enteric nerves and endogenous mediators (such as 5 -HT, prostaglandins). Although the potential of calcium-calmodulin inhibition has as yet not been realised, preliminary studies suggest that there are chloride channel blockers under development that will find a place in the management of secretory diarrheas. Recent work has highlighted the importance of neurohumoral mechanisms in the pathogenesis of acute diarrhea. Potentiation of the effects of endogenous enkephalin activity by enkephalinase inhibition has already produced a safe, effective anti-secretory drug, <b>racecadotril.</b> Speculative early work indicates that there may be a role for antagonists of 5 -HT, substance P, and VIP receptors. There now seems to be a real possibility that antisecretory therapy will become more widely available in the future...|$|E
40|$|Background In 2008, the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the European Society of Paediatric Infectious Disease (ESPID) {{developed}} evidence-based {{guidelines for}} the management of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children in Europe. Aim To summarise data published subsequently to the ESPGHAN/ESPID guidelines. Methods MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library were searched in August 2012 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or their meta-analyses published after 2008. Results Efforts to improve the taste and/or efficacy of oral rehydration solution (ORS) continue, and some interventions are promising. While standard (over 24 h) nasogastric rehydration is still being used, new evidence confirms that rapid (over 4 h) rehydration is also effective. For intravenous rehydration, new evidence is available regarding rapid or ultrarapid and large-volume vs. standard-volume rehydration; as the new evidence is not consistent, until more data are available, the administration of 20 mL/kg seems appropriate. Convincing evidence has accumulated showing that ondansetron reduces the risk for vomiting; however, a clearance on safety in children is needed. New evidence has reconfirmed that in Europe, where zinc deficiency is rare, there is no benefit from the use of zinc. New data, although mainly from outside of Europe, have reconfirmed that either smectite or <b>racecadotril</b> is an effective adjunctive therapy to oral rehydration. There is a clear effect of using certain probiotics, such as Lactobacillus GG or S. boulardii. Conclusions The update of current ESPGHAN/ESPID recommendations is warrante...|$|E
