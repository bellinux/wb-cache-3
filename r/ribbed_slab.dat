50|$|A {{waffle slab}} foundation, also called a <b>ribbed</b> <b>slab</b> foundation, is an {{above-ground}} type of foundation {{used to provide}} load-bearing capacity in expansive, rocky or hydro collapsible soils. The foundation is created by placing a series of single-use plastic forms set directly on grade to create a grid of ribs, and then monolithically pouring a post tensioned, rebar or Fiber reinforced concrete slab, usually 4 to 8 inches thick between the ribs. Sometimes, expanded polystyrene blocks are used instead of plastic forms, to prevent creating an air space under the slab. The monolithic pour creates concrete beams running throughout the footprint and perimeter of the foundation, with voids between, in one operation. The completed slab then sits on the ground bearing on the ribs created between the forms. The void areas underneath the slab allow for soil movement.|$|E

Four ribbed slabs with similar dimensions of 2. 8 m length × 1. 2 m width and 0. 2 m thickness were constructed. Two of the samples were considered as control samples (conventionally reinforced with reinforcement bars and welded mesh) while another two samples were fully reinforced with 1 % (80 kg/m 3) volume of steel fibres incorporated to the SCC mix. For the flexural behaviour study, the <b>ribbed</b> <b>slab</b> samples were subjected to two line loads under four point bending. Meanwhile, for the punching shear analysis, the <b>ribbed</b> <b>slab</b> samples were subjected to a point load to simulate loading from the column. The analysis of the experimental results displayed that steel fibres incorporation had been found to effectively delay the first crack occurrence under both flexural and punching shear. The steel fibre replacement has been proven {{to be able to}} sustain up to 80 % and 73 % of the ultimate load resistance for flexural and punching shear, respectively, in comparison to conventionally reinforced <b>ribbed</b> <b>slab</b> structure.

40|$|Local {{and perhaps}} {{regional}} vernacular reinforced concrete building construction leans heavily against designing slabs with imbedded hidden beams for flooring systems in most structures including major edifices. The practice is distinctive in both framed and in shear wall structures. Hidden beams are favoured structural elements {{due to their}} many inherent features that characterize them; they save on floor height clearance; they also save on formwork, labour and material cost. Moreover, hidden beams form an acceptable aesthetic appearance that does not hinder efficient interior space partitioning. Such beams have the added advantage of {{clearing the way for}} horizontal electromechanical ductwork. However, seismic considerations, in all likelihood, are seldom seriously addressed. The mentioned structural system of shallow beams is adopted in <b>ribbed</b> <b>slabs,</b> waffle slabs and at times with solid <b>slabs.</b> <b>Ribbed</b> <b>slabs</b> and waffle slabs are more prone to hidden beam inclusion due to the added effective height of the concrete section. Due to the presence of a relatively high reinforcement ratio at the joints the sections at such location tend to become less ductile with unreliable contribution to spandrel force resistance. In the following study the structural influence of hidden beams within slabs is investigated. With the primary focus on a performance based analysis of such elements within a structure. This is investigated with due attention to shear wall contribution to the overall behaviour of such structures. Numerical results point in the direction that the function of hidden beams is not as adequate as desired. Therefore it is strongly believed that they are generally superfluous and maybe eliminated altogether. Conversely, shallow beams seem to render the overall seismic capacity of the structure unreliable. Since such an argument is rarely manifested within the linear analysis domain; a pushover analysis exercise is thus mandatory for behaviour prediction under strong seismic events. In such events drop beams have the edge...|$|R
40|$|The {{vibration}} reduction index, Kij, {{is related}} to the transmission of the vibrational power over a junction between structural elements. Two empirical models are proposed to evaluate Kij, on the basis of statistical evaluations of numerous in-field tests carried out on rigid junctions between floors made by concrete beams and <b>ribbed</b> <b>slab</b> with brick blocks and brickwork walls, a type of junction that is frequently encountered in Southern European and Mediterranean buildings. These models can be applied in order to calculate the sound insulation properties, such as the normalized impact sound pressure level, L 0 n, and the apparent sound reduction index, R 0, of walls and floors in buildings. The first model allows the single number value of the vibration sound reduction index of a junction to be calculated, {{on the basis of the}} real properties of the materials that constitute the junction. A new quantity, the ‘‘essential" mass per unit area, was introduced to implement the model.

I analysed the structure staticly {{according to the new}} European standard and compared the results with the results of the analysis done according to the Yugoslav regulations PBAB in force at the time. The load- bearing construction of the prefabricated hall is made of reinforced concrete and constructed from vertical and horizontal elements which form the frame. The analysis of internal forces was done on a 3 D model in the TOWER programme. I ran two different models of the load- bearing construction, compared the internal forces and calculated the significance of creating accurate models, which is to say I looked at what gets neglected and what the consequences of using simplified models are. I created a did detailed dimensioning for the column, <b>ribbed</b> <b>slab,</b> load-bearing structure with variable height and for the flat slab. The results show that simplified models can have devastating consequences for the columns as the internal forces calculated on accurate models are much greater and consequently so is the necessary amount of longitudinal reinforcement. The cause of much greater internal forces is primarily due to the different behaviour of a model, which depends on the centre of rigidity and the distribution of forces on individual elements.

Two case studies are discussed ; the first is a waffle slab with solid heads, and the second is a waffle slab with band beams along column centerlines. Direct design method is used for the structural analysis and design of slabs. The cost function represents the cost of concrete, steel, and formwork for the slab.

40|$|Abstract- Reinforced {{concrete}} is {{the principal}} material for military engineering and nuclear power plant containment. Reinforced concrete slabs are used in floors, roofs and walls of buildings and as the decks of bridges. The floor system of a structure can take many forms such as in situ solid slab, <b>ribbed</b> <b>slab</b> or pre-cast units. By providing torsion reinforcement, corners are usually prevented from being lifted up. In such cases the corners have to be suitably reinforced at top and also at bottom otherwise cracks are liable to be formed at the corners. The present investigation is intended to study the influence of torsion reinforcement in reinforced concrete slab with end condition all ends discontinuous under uniformly distributed load. Slabs with torsion reinforcement varying from 0 % to 30 % were casted and tested. Increasing in the torsion reinforcement controls the deflection of the slab element. As the torsion reinforcement increases the corners are being held down.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author © 2007 Upul PereraThis report describes an investigation of seismic performance of a <b>ribbed</b> <b>slab</b> system constructed with an innovative re-usable sheet metal formwork system. Experimental results from quasi-static cyclic lateral load tests on half-scale reinforced concrete interior beam-slab-column subassemblages are presented. The test specimen was detailed according to the Australian code (AS 3600) without any special provision for seismicity. This specimen was tested up to a drift ratio of 4. 0 %. Some reinforcement detailing problems were identified from the first test. The damaged specimen was then rectified using Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRPs), considering detailing deficiencies identified in the first test. The repaired test specimen was tested under a lateral cyclic load as per the original test arrangement up to a drift level of 4 %. The performance of the repaired specimen showed significant improvement {{with respect to the}} level of damage and strength degradation. The results of the rectified specimen indicate that the use of CFRPs may offer a viable retrofit/repair strategy in the case of damaged structures, where this damage may be significant. Two finite element analysis models were created and results of the first test were used to calibrate the FE model. The second FE model was used to obtain detail information about stress and strain behaviour of various components of the beam-column subassemblage and to check the overall performance before carrying out expensive lab tests. It was concluded that finite element modelling predictions were reliable and could be used to obtain more information compared to conventional type laboratory tests. Time-history analyses show that the revised detailing is suitable to withstand very large earthquakes without significant structural damage. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the large {{displacement}} behaviour of floor slab systems under extreme loading conditions. The analytical model, presented in the companion paper, is verified through comparisons against existing experimental results on both reinforced concrete and composite slabs, with flat or ribbed profiles. The new model incorporates a novel shell element and accounts for material and geometric nonlinearities under ambient as well as elevated temperatures. The verification studies examine the response of reinforced concrete slabs under unrestrained and restrained edge conditions. An assessment of the behaviour of <b>ribbed</b> floor <b>slabs</b> is also undertaken, in addition to simulation of the structural response of a full-scale composite beam-slab floor system under a realistic compartment fire situation. The results show good correlation between the experimental findings and numerical predictions, and demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the proposed analytical model. Additionally, the studies and discussions presented in this investigation provide an insight into the key behavioural aspects of floor slabs under extreme conditions. In particular, the significance of compressive arching and tensile membrane actions, under various boundary conditions, is illustrated. Also, the importance of adopting a realistic representation of the composite slab geometry is highlighted. The proposed analytical model is of particular relevance to developments in performance-based structural fire design, where realistic assessment of the floor slab response is of paramount importance...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{describes a}} series of studio-based research projects on structural optimisation and the cost-effectiveness of digital fabrication that aim to balance stress distribution across thick walls or a <b>rib</b> density of <b>slabs.</b> As {{a consequence of the}} structural optimisations, the results tend to be non-uniform shapes that are not ideal for cost-effective fabrication. This paper introduces a few simple models to balance structural optimisation and fabrication cost-effectiveness. It involves relatively simple structural simulations as the design inputs, and then converts the simulation results into various architectural forms using parametric 3 D modelling tool (McNeel Rhinoceros v 4, Grasshopper v 0. 8) before fabricating them using digital fabrication technologies. The major challenge of this study is how to translate simulation results into architectural components/overall building shapes and how to fabricate complex forms in a cost-effective manner...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} represents a theoretical and experimental {{contribution to the}} understanding of the structural behaviour of elements made of ultra-high performance fibre-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC). UHPFRC is investigated as an advanced cementitious material offering particular potential in innovative bridge design. The optimised material composition results in high compressive strength and non-negligible tensile strength and ductility, provided by multi-microcracking. This allows significant tensile forces to be sustained by elements in bending even without the use of ordinary reinforcement. Thanks also to the material's resistance to environmental degradation, very thin structural elements can be constructed. This research focuses primarily on the bending behaviour and design of thin UHPFRC beams and slabs. Punching-shear is also investigated as a possible failure mode of thin UHPFRC slabs. One of the main differences between other concretes and UHPFRC is that the latter requires mechanical models capable of taking tensile behaviour into account for rational structural application. Analytical and numerical models are developed in this study to simulate the non-linear bending response of UHPFRC beams and slabs. This permits the assessment of element behaviour at service states and prediction of failure loads. Theoretical research on both bending and punching-shear failure is supported by experimental research on beams and slabs made of BSI® UHPFRC with 2. 5 % volume of 20 -mm long steel fibres. The analytical model for beams in bending takes both material multi-microcracking and macrocrack propagation with tensile softening into consideration. Multi-microcracking is modelled as a pseudo-plastic tensile behaviour, while the macrocrack is simulated based on the assumptions of the fictitious crack model. The results are in good agreement with experimental data and simulations obtained from a developed finite element model. Using theoretical results and experimental data it is demonstrated that pre-peak behaviour and bending strength are mainly governed by multi-microcracking. The propagation of the macrocrack provides only a minor additional contribution to bending strength, but, in the case of thin beams, plays an important role in providing ductility in bending. Theoretical results demonstrate that, due to the presence of pronounced pseudo-plastic deformations, size effect on bending strength is much less significant for UHPFRC than for other quasi-brittle materials, which corresponds to experimental observations. It is however shown that, even if the pseudo-plastic phase is less pronounced, thin elements develop behaviour similar to that of elements with high pseudo-plastic tensile deformations, owing to the low stress decrease in tensile softening. Nonetheless, in the absence of pseudo-plastic tensile deformations, the behaviour of thick elements approaches that of typical quasi-brittle materials, with a more pronounced size effect. In the case of thin statically indeterminate beams and slabs, it is shown that a high level of tensile ductility can allow sufficient internal force redistribution to occur, leading to a significant increase in load-bearing capacity. Moreover, high rotations can be sustained after cracking while almost constant bending strength is maintained, resulting in a plastic-like behaviour. It is demonstrated that the theory of plasticity can thus be applied: a formulation is proposed to predict the resistant plastic moment, enabling easy estimation of the bending failure load for thin elements. The analysis results show good agreement with test results for slabs of different thicknesses. However, due to the remarkable size effect on ductility in bending, the rotation capacity of UHPFRC elements thicker than approximately 100 mm is limited, and the theory of plasticity does not apply. Experimental and theoretical research on the punching-shear failure of thin UHPFRC slabs demonstrates the influence of structural parameters on achieved shear resistance. A proposal is made for considering fibre contribution in shear resistance as a structure-dependent parameter, relating the critical shear crack opening to slab rotation. This approach results in more accurate predictions for thin elements with larger deformations as compared to current code predictions that overestimate resistances for such elements. With a view to the structural application of UHPFRC in bridge design, the concept of <b>ribbed</b> deck <b>slab</b> is studied. Based on the theoretical and experimental results it is demonstrated that thin UHPFRC slabs (40 - 60 mm) without ordinary reinforcement can be effectively used in this concept: sufficient bending and punching-shear resistances to locally applied traffic loads can be ensured. With prestressed <b>ribs,</b> UHPFRC <b>ribbed</b> <b>slabs</b> attain high load-bearing capacity, while structural dead weight is significantly decreased. This concept could open up new vistas in the design of new structures and offers effective possibilities for the structural repair or widening of existing bridges...|$|R
