Patients and Methods: This was a clinical trial prospective study approved by Menoufia University research ethics board (REB) and included 50 Egyptian patients selected from the ENT department of Menoufia University between June 2011 to November 2014, who were suffering from chronic frontal sinusitis. Preoperative CT with coronal, axial and sagittal cuts were examined to show anatomical variants. Frontalsinusotomy was doneendoscopically and surgicall easiness was evaluated. Results: Increased aggernasi cell size was associated with increased operative easiness. Increase danteroposteri or diameter of frontal sinus ostium was associated with increased operative easiness.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the correlation between}} peripheral anterior synechia (PAS) and the quantitative anterior chamber angle parameters measured by ultrasound microscopy (UBM) in angle-closure glaucoma suspect (ACGS) eyes. Methods: Eyes were defined ACGS as having occludable angles and intraocular pressure less than 21 mm Hg without glaucomatous optic nerve head. The gonioscopic criteria for ACGS were the trabecular meshwork invisible in 3 or more quadrants of the entire angle and the angular width less than 20 degrees by Shaffer classification. Twenty-seven eyes of 20 patients underwent anterior chamber angle and ciliary body imaging with UBM. Angle opening distance (AOD 500), angle <b>recess</b> <b>area</b> (ARA), trabecular-ciliary process distance (TCPD) and trabecular-iris angle (TIA) were measured from the UBM images at each quadrant.

The frontal <b>recess</b> <b>area</b> represents {{a challenge to}} ENT surgeons due to its narrow confines and variable anatomy. Several types of cells have been described in this area. The agger nasi cells are the most constant ones. The frontal cells, originally classified by Kuhn into 4 types, {{have been reported in}} the literature to exist in 20 %– 41 % of frontal recesses. Aim of the Study. To identify the prevalence of frontal recess cells and their relation to frontal sinus disease. Methods. Coronal and axial CT scans of paranasal sinuses of 70 patients admitted for functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) were reviewed to identify the agger nasi, frontal cells, and frontal sinus disease. Data was collated for right and left sides separately. Results. Of the 140 sides reviewed, 126 (90 %) had agger nasi and 110 (78. 571 %) had frontal cells. 37 frontal sinuses were free of mucosal disease, 48 were partly opacified, and 50 were totally opacified. There was no significant difference found in frontal sinus mucosal disease in presence or absence of frontal cells or agger nasi. Conclusions. The current study shows that frontal cells might be underreported in the literature, as the prevalence identified is noticeably higher than previous studies. 1...|$|E

Methods. Thirty-eight eyes of 24 patients with open angle glaucoma were scanned with swept source AS-OCT before and 4 weeks after combined Trabectome-cataract or Trabectome-only surgery. Intraocular pressure, number of medications, and AS-OCT parameters, such as angle opening distance at 500 and 750 [*]μm from the scleral spur (AOD 500 and AOD 750), trabecular-iris space area at 500 and 750 [*]mm 2 (TISA 500, TISA 750), angle <b>recess</b> <b>area</b> at 500 and 750 [*]mm 2 (ARA 500, ARA 750), trabecular iris angle (TIA), anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber width (ACW), and anterior chamber volume (ACV), were obtained before the surgery.

40|$|Purpose: To {{quantify}} the configuration changes in anterior segment structures after cataract extraction using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). Material and Method: 33 eyes of 33 patients (21 male, 12 female; mean age: 69. 0 ± 8. 3 years) with senile or presenile cataracts undergoing cataract surgery were prospectively studied. UBM was performed for each patient before and 1 month after surgery. At each UBM examination, axial {{images of the}} anterior chamber and radial sections of the angle in four quadrants were obtained. The measurements were performed by using the calipers included in the equipment software and UBM Pro 2000 ® software. Results: After cataract surgery, we determined statistically significant increases in anterior chamber depth and angle parameters (p= 0. 001). We found that the postoperative increases in anterior chamber depth, angle <b>recess</b> <b>area,</b> angle opening distance 250 and angle opening distance 500 were 1. 3, 1. 4, 1. 7 and 1. 5 times, respectively, {{when compared with the}} preoperative levels.

Discussion: UBM gives both qualitative and quantitative valuable information about anterior segment structures.

40|$|Purpose: To {{review the}} {{parameters}} for {{quantitative assessment of}} the anterior segment and iridocorneal angle {{and to develop a}} comprehensive schematic for the evaluation of angle anatomy and pathophysiology by high-resolution imaging. Methods: The published literature of the last 15 years was reviewed, analyzed, and organized into a construct for assessment of anterior segment processes. Results: Modern anterior segment imaging techniques have allowed us to devise new quantitative parameters to improve the information obtained. Ultrasound biomicroscopy, slit-lamp optical coherence tomography, and anterior segment optical coherence tomography provide high-resolution images for analysis of physiologic and pathologic processes. These include iridocorneal angle analysis (eg, angle opening distance, angle <b>recess</b> <b>area,</b> trabecular-iris space area), anterior and posterior chamber depth and area, iris and ciliary body cross-sectional area and volume, quantitative anatomic relationships between structures, and videographic analysis of iris movement and accommodative changes under various conditions. Modern devices permit imaging of the entire anterior chamber, allowing calculation of anterior chamber and pupillary diameters and correlating these with measurement of anterior chamber dynamics in light vs dark conditions. We have tabulated all reported anterior segment measurement modalities and devised a construct for assessment of normal and abnormal conditions. Conclusion: Quantitative measurement of static and dynamic anterior segment parameters, both normal and abnormal, provides a broad range of parameters for analysis of the numerous aspects of the pathophysiology of the anterior segment of the eye.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} diurnal {{intraocular pressure}} (DIOP) among individuals with Primary Angle Closure (PAC) or Primary Angle Closure Suspect (PACS). Additionally {{the hypothesis that}} greater DIOP fluctuation is related to smaller angle parameters was investigated. Methods: 40 Caucasian newly referred untreated patients with bilateral PAC or PACS were recruited. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured hourly between 09. 00 and 16. 00 with Goldmann applanation tonometry. DIOP fluctuation was defined as difference between maximum and minimum IOP. Angle Opening Distance, AOD; Trabecular-Iris Angle (TIA); Angle <b>Recess</b> <b>Area</b> (ARA); Trabecular Iris Space Area (TISA) were measured with AS-OCT (CASIA) in dark (0. 3 - 0. 5 lux) and light (170 - 200 lux) {{on the same day}} as DIOP measurements in eight angle sections. Results: IOP declined as the day progressed (p< 0. 001), unrelated to presence of PAS. At each timepoint, eyes with PAS (n= 31) had significantly higher IOPs than eyes without PAS (n= 49; p= 0. 043). DIOP fluctuation varied from 1. 50 mmHg to 14. 50 mmHg (mean 5. 99 mmHg, SD 2. 70 mmHg). DIOP fluctuation was unrelated to PAS. Multiple-predictor models investigating association of angle dimensions and greater DIOP fluctuation were statistically significant for AOD 750 (light), ARA 750 (light and dark), TISA 500 (light), TISA 750 (light), TIA 500 (light) and TIA 750 (light and dark). Conclusions: DIOP variation has clinical implications given that IOP level is used to distinguish between diagnostic categories of PACS and PAC. OCT angle parameter measurements may predict for magnitude of IOP diurnal fluctuations in at-risk patients, which may be clinical useful when considering a clinical intervention...|$|E
