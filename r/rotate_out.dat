25|$|Deliveries to the Air Force {{began in}} 1956, with 145 {{of this model}} produced. RB-66s were used as the primary night photo-reconnaissance {{aircraft}} of the USAF during this time, many examples serving with tactical reconnaissance squadrons based in the United Kingdom and in West Germany. A total of 72 of the B-66B bomber version were built, 69 fewer than originally planned. A total of 13 B-66B aircraft later were modified into EB-66B electronic countermeasures aircraft for the cold war with Russia, and were stationed at RAF Chelveston with the 42nd Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron who did the conversion in the early 1960s. They would <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> of an alert pad in Spain {{during the time that}} the 42nd had them. These and the RB-66Cs that the 42nd had would eventually be sent to Vietnam. Unlike the U.S. Navy's A-3 Skywarrior, which performed some bombing missions, the Destroyer was not used as a bomber in Vietnam.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{taking control}} of the {{battered}} Eighth Army, one of Ridgway's first acts was to restore soldiers' confidence in themselves. To accomplish this, he reorganized the command structure. During one of his first briefings in Korea at I Corps, Ridgway sat through an extensive discussion of various defensive plans and contingencies. At the end, he asked the staff about the status of their attack plans; the corps G–3 (operations officer) responded that he had no such plans. Within days, I Corps had a new G-3. He also replaced officers who did not send out patrols to fix enemy locations, and removed [...] "enemy positions" [...] from commanders' planning maps if local units had not been in recent contact to verify that the enemy was still there. Ridgway established a plan to <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> those division commanders who had been in action for six months and replace them with fresh leaders. He sent out guidance to commanders at all levels that they were to spend more time at the front lines and less in their command posts in the rear. These steps had an immediate impact on morale.|$|E

50|$|As {{the drum}} <b>rotates</b> into and <b>out</b> of the trough, the slurry is sucked {{on the surface}} of the cloth and <b>rotated</b> <b>out</b> of the liquid/solids {{suspension}} as a cake. When the cake is <b>rotating</b> <b>out,</b> it is dewatered in the drying zone. The cake is dry because the vacuum drum is continuously sucking the cake and taking the water out of it. At the final step of the separation, the cake is discharged as solids products and the drum rotates continuously to another separation cycle.|$|R

50|$|Directional Control is {{achieved}} by moving the rig either forward (turning away from the wind) or aft (turning towards the wind). When jibing, the clew of the sail is let around and allowed to <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> and around the mast.|$|E
5000|$|Iliacus: {{originates}} on {{ventral side}} of ilium, inserts into trochanter minor of femur with a tendon that intersects with a tendon of the psoas major. Lies under the medial gluteus muscle. Allows the hip to flex, rotates the femur to <b>rotate</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
50|$|White {{suggested}} future experiments {{could run}} on a Cavendish balance. In such a setup, the thruster could <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> to much larger angular displacements, letting a thrust (if present) dominate any possible thermal effects. Testing a device in space would also eliminate the center-of-gravity issue.|$|E

50|$|The 64 {{events of}} NCSO range from {{engineering}} events like Mystery Architecture, Towers and Helicopters to content {{events such as}} Microbe Mission, Forensics, and Ecology. The events change each year as new topics are rotated in and old topics <b>rotate</b> <b>out,</b> to ensure every part of curriculum is covered.|$|E
5000|$|Some solo {{songs like}} [...] "In Summer" [...] were changed by Webb to {{ensemble}} numbers. Some scenes such as Wandering Oaken’s Trading Post and Sauna and characters such as Marshmallow, the ice monster were removed. For the [...] "Let It Go" [...] sequence, Elsa stands {{on top of}} crystal stairs that <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> over the crowd.|$|E
50|$|Desk {{officers}} <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> {{of their}} positions {{every two years}} and often have little lead time to learn the scope of their new job. Diplopedia provides a desk officer manual, advising them on everything from {{what to make of}} Department jargon, how to move a paper for decision, or how to navigate a new Ambassador through the complexities of Senate confirmation and assignment to his or her mission.|$|E

50|$|In real-life police departments, {{officers}} {{who work in}} Special Victims Units must <b>rotate</b> <b>out,</b> or otherwise they become affected by the horrible things they see {{in the course of}} their jobs. Absolution explores the idea that if police departments employed superhumans, what if they were rare enough that they were the only ones who could do their job, and stayed in that capacity for too long, becoming mentally and emotionally destabilized.|$|E
50|$|A {{large part}} of the game's {{challenge}} is based on jumping from platform to platform while avoiding environmental hazards, such as enemies and traps. Platforms are usually stationary, but some may <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> from under the player, move through the environment like a rail shooter (the gondola in the Tunnel level), and crumble or fall away underfoot. There are also some invisible platforms that either afford players a strategic advantage or lead to hidden items.|$|E
50|$|The Solway Harvester was {{launched}} in 1992. An automated scallop dredger, she was fitted with sections along the sides which would <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> and upwards to deposit the catch on the deck. She was 70 ft (21m) long and had accommodation for eight on board, plus a workshop, ice machine and storage for the catch. She was owned by Richard Gidney and operated {{under the command of}} her skipper, Andrew (Craig) Mills. Her crew were all from the Isle of Whithorn area of Dumfries and Galloway.|$|E
50|$|Rosemount's {{solution}} was to build the boot in two halves, one covering {{the majority of the}} foot and leg, and a smaller section that hinged along the footbed, <b>rotating</b> <b>out</b> to the side. To put the boot on, the moving section was <b>rotated</b> <b>out,</b> allowing the skier's foot to be inserted through the opened side of the boot. The moving section was then rotated up, back into place, and held there by two buckles, one on the foot and one on the leg cuff. The seam was then sealed from the snow with an elastic material that was stretched over the front of the boot.|$|R

5000|$|Hoof {{swings in}} as the horse picks up its hocks and then <b>rotates</b> <b>out,</b> predisposing the animal to {{interference}} and causing excess stress on lateral hock structures, predisposing the horse to bog and bone spavin, and thoroughpin.|$|R
5000|$|Fan {{reaction}} to prize wheels {{led to an}} update [...] that began phasing out the prize wheels in favor of shop challenges, which would give players a set selection of prizes to choose from following a victory. Each prize would cost {{a certain number of}} tokens based on type (DNA cards, for example, require more tokens than attribute-raising items), and would periodically <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> to make way for new prizes. Like prize wheels, prizes typically include items for raising character attributes, greenbacks, T-coins, DNA cards and pizza points.|$|E
5000|$|Standard, {{formerly}} known as Type 2, contains anywhere from five to eight sets. The Standard card pool undergoes a [...] "rotation" [...] once a year, usually in October, when older sets <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> of the format and the fall set is released. As of July 14, 2017, the Standard card pool consists of Battle for Zendikar, Oath of the Gatewatch, Shadows over Innistrad, Eldritch Moon, Kaladesh, Aether Revolt, Amonkhet, and Hour of Devastation, with 5 cards banned. For the history of Standard, see Timeline of Magic: the Gathering Standard (Type II).|$|E
5000|$|As a twin {{cam system}} relies on each cam {{rotating}} independently, {{based solely on}} the force of the string and the resistance of the bow limbs being absolutely symmetrical, there is room for a twin cam system to [...] "lose tune" [...] through wear and tear, string stretch, or just general age. The effect of a detuned twin cam bow is that the two cams <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> of sync with each other, causing the bowstring to accelerate in two alternating directions upon release. This causes a number of adverse consequences, the most obvious being unsteady arrow flight.|$|E
5000|$|Radial (obsolete) — Hand powered davit. This type {{was used}} on the Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic. Each arm must be <b>rotated</b> <b>out</b> manually; uses manila rope falls. Goose-neck shape to the arm that is swung out.|$|R
50|$|Judge Reif was {{selected}} as Chief Justice for a two-year term, starting January 1, 2015. The court also elected Justice Douglas Combs of Shawnee as vice chief justice. Reif's predecessor, Tom Colbert, <b>rotates</b> <b>out</b> of the Chief Justice position.|$|R
50|$|Ambidextrous Manual Decocking Lever. Accessible by {{the thumb}} of a right- or left-handed shooter, it was spring-loaded. When pushed down, the rear {{part of the}} firing pin (striker) <b>rotated</b> <b>out</b> of {{alignment}} with the front part of the firing pin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{numbering}} system of licence plates also varies among the jurisdictions. Some states issue a motorist a serial that stays {{with that person}} {{as long as they}} live in that state, while other states periodically issue new serials and completely <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> any old ones. Some states issue licence plates to vehicles rather than owners, and the serial stays with the vehicle for its life. Several states do not regularly use certain letters [...] - [...] most commonly the letters I, O, and/or Q [...] - [...] in their plates, except on vanity plates, so as not to confuse observers with the numbers one and zero.|$|E
5000|$|Within the {{battalion}} {{there exists a}} midshipman candidate led chain of command. The midshipmen candidates holding positions of authority are called [...] "stripers", because they wear collar devices {{with the number of}} stripes that are assigned to each position. Stripers are selected by the military staff and serve the term of one marking period, after which they <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> with new midshipmen candidates. The responsibilities of stripers are: delegating orders from the senior military staff to the students, taking accountability of {{the battalion}}, writing the watchbill for other students, organizing their respective companies and platoons for each event the midshipmen candidates attend, and maintaining general cleanliness of Ripley Hall.|$|E
50|$|The Extended format, {{formerly}} known as Type 1.x, consists {{of the last four}} years of blocks and core sets. With each autumn set release, one year's worth of sets <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> of the format. Any additional sets released between rotations are automatically added to this format's card pool. The format previously contained seven years' of blocks and core sets. The new system was implemented in July 2010 to reduce the format's card pool, with the intention that this would make the format more understandable and attractive to play. On July 22, 2013, Wizards of the Coast announced that the Extended format would be retired, with the final sanctioned events occurring on October 8, 2013.|$|E
25|$|In August 1952 the 256th {{was moved}} back to Kamen-Rybolov when the 190th IAD <b>rotated</b> <b>out</b> of China. Zabelin became the regiment's {{permanent}} commander in November. The regiment received Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 aircraft in 1954. The regiment was disbanded on 13 June 1959.|$|R
