This usage {{has been growing}} {{at a low rate}} for many years as far as number of houses being built in every year is concerned. The companies engaging in <b>roof</b> thermal <b>insulation</b> business found it difficulty to maintain their business particularly in a situation where more players are trying to enter into the same business. This has started happening now and the existing market is shared among several companies. Therefore, it is important and necessary to find out the ways of increasing the sales volumes of <b>roof</b> thermal <b>insulation</b> so that every company in the business can maintain and achieve their business objectives. Knowing consumer buying behavior is very important aspect in marketing. It helps to increase sales Along with right marketing strategies particularly in a market with high potential. Market potential of local domestic <b>roof</b> thermal <b>insulations</b> is very high, which is corresponding to the number of houses being built in each year. However, according to the hosing population of department of census and statistics and present sales volume, about 10 % of that market is captured by now. therefore, a research study on <b>roof</b> thermal <b>insulation</b> consumer buying behavior is very important to find a solution for the existing problem of low sales penetration of <b>roof</b> thermal <b>insulations</b> in local domestic sector. In turn, this will help to achieve the business objective of the companies engrain in <b>roof</b> thermal <b>insulation</b> business. It is easy to study <b>roof</b> thermal <b>insulation</b> consumer buying behavior by understanding the influences along with their level of impact on that. understanding the level of impact of main factors or influences on <b>roof</b> thermal <b>insulation</b> consumer buying behavior is much needed and has to be carried out first. Therefore, culture, groups, knowledge,product and price, which are considered as major influences or factors, are taken into consideration in this research. One the other hand more use of <b>roof</b> thermal <b>insulation</b> by households will give several benefits. It Helps to reduce energy used for thermal comfort by active means such as using fans, air conditioners And blowers, etc. Consumers will get benefits in terms of thermal comfort as well as reduction in Electricity bill. Sri Lanka will get benefits in terms of saving energy which is very important in the present context since it depends on thermal power that uses non-renewable sources such as petroleum and also the cost of energy that remains high. This energy saving will give the benefits to very one in the world because it could lead to reduce the carbon dioxide emission and in turn it help to reduce a very serious problem of global warming...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{various aspects}} and {{relative}} {{advantages of the}} use of different type <b>insulation</b> boards in <b>roofing</b> systems are discussed. HE RAPIDLY ESCALATING cost of energy has stimulated the frequentTuse of new insulation products and the usage of greater thermal resistant insulation systems. With this increased use of new products and greater thermal resistant systems, designers are faced with increas-ing difficulties in keeping properly informed of the insulation material effectiveness, and the relationship between <b>roofing</b> <b>insulation</b> systems and the performance of built-up roofing systems. The current basis of <b>roofing</b> <b>insulation</b> selection appears to emphasize the lowest cost per unit of thermal resistance. Insulation selection based solely on this basis can result in serious damage to the building and its contents, costly remedial construction, and serious damage to the building and its con-tents, costly remedial construction, and serious damage to the reputa-tion of the designer. Designers must, for the sake of their professional integrity and their legal self-defense, be well informed of the practicali-ty, usage, and potential of available insulations, and how the insulation design selection affects the performance and life expectancy of roofing systems. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide designers with a method to select insulation materials and systems not only meeting the re-quirements of building codes and insurance writers, but also to minimize construction costs, to provide a suitable substrate for built-up roofing membranes, and to optimize the performance and service life of built-up roofing membranes...|$|R
50|$|PIR is {{typically}} produced as a foam {{and used as}} rigid thermal insulation. Its thermal conductivity has a typical value of 0.16 BTU·in/(hr·ft2·°F) (0.023 W/(m·K)) depending on the perimeter:area ratio. PIR foam panels laminated with pure embossed aluminium foil are used for fabrication of pre-insulated duct that is used for heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Prefabricated PIR sandwich panels are manufactured with corrosion-protected, corrugated steel facings bonded to a core of PIR foam and used extensively as <b>roofing</b> <b>insulation</b> and vertical walls (e.g. for warehousing, factories, office buildings etc.). Other typical uses for PIR foams include industrial and commercial pipe insulation, and carving/machining media (competing with expanded polystyrene and rigid polyurethane foams).|$|R
