40|$|Crassulacean acid {{metabolism}} (CAM) is {{a specialized}} mode of photosynthesis that features nocturnal CO(2) uptake, facilitates increased water-use efficiency (WUE), and enables CAM plants to inhabit water-limited environments such as semi-arid deserts or seasonally dry forests. Human {{population growth and}} global climate change now present challenges for agricultural production systems to increase food, feed, forage, fiber, and fuel production. One approach {{to meet these challenges}} is to increase reliance on CAM crops, such as Agave and Opuntia, for biomass production on semi-arid, abandoned, marginal, or degraded agricultural lands. Major research efforts are now underway to assess the productivity of CAM crop species and to harness the WUE of CAM by engineering this pathway into existing food, feed, and bioenergy crops. An improved understanding of CAM has potential for high <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>research</b> investment. To exploit the potential of CAM crops and CAM bioengineering, {{it will be necessary to}} elucidate the evolution, genomic features, and regulatory mechanisms of CAM.

Different micronutrient interventions {{are currently being}} used, but their overall coverage is relatively limited. Biofortification that is, breeding staple food crops for higher micronutrient contents has been proposed as a new agriculture-based approach. Yet, as biofortified crops are still under development, relatively {{little is known about}} their economic impacts and wider ramifications. In this article, the main factors that will influence their future success are discussed, and a methodology for economic impact assessment is presented, combining agricultural, nutrition, and health aspects. Ex ante studies from India and other developing countries suggest that biofortified crops can reduce the problem of micronutrient malnutrition in a cost-effective way, when they are targeted to specific situations. Projected social <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>research</b> investments are high and competitive with productivity-enhancing agricultural technologies. These promising results notwithstanding, biofortification should be seen as a complement rather than a substitute for existing micronutrient interventions, since the magnitude and complexity of the problem necessitate a multiplicity of approaches.

This report identifies new methodologies and metrics {{that can be}} developed and used for assessing <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>research</b> across {{a wide range of}} fields (biomedical, information technology, energy, agriculture, environment, and other biological and physical sciences, etc.), while using one or more background papers that review current methodologies {{as a starting point for}} the discussion. It focuses on tools that are able to exploit available data in the relatively near term rather than on methodologies that may require substantial new data collection. Over the last several years, there has been a growing interest in policy circles in identifying the payoffs from federal agency research investments, especially in terms of economic growth, competitiveness, and jobs. The extraordinary increase in research expenditures under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 and the PresidentÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs commitment to science and technology (S&T) funding increases going forward have heightened the need for measuring the impacts of research investments. Without a credible analysis of their outcomes, the recent and proposed increases in S&T funding may not be sustained, especially given competing claims for federal funding and pressures to reduce projected federal budget deficits. Motivated by these needs and requirements, Measuring the Economic Impacts of Federal Investments in Research reviews and discusses the use of quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the returns on federal research and development (R&D) investments. Despite the job-focused mandate of the current ARRA reporting requirements, the impact of S&T funding extend well beyond employment. For instance, federal funding in energy research may lead to innovations that would reduce energy costs at the household level, energy imports at the national level, and greenhouse gas emissions at the global level. In principle, these benefits can be measured as a return on research investments, with appropriate consideration of time lags to research outcomes and attribution to private as well as public expenditure. With appropriate metrics, the same could be true for benefits to public health, environmental quality, and food productivity and security. Federal funding of research leads to the development of human capital that is deployed in a variety of occupations with economic and social impacts. Research also produces information that is used in formal (e. g., regulatory and judicial) and informal (e. g., firm and consumer) decision making processes. In addition to reviewing the range of work (by academics, consultants, and research agencies themselves) that has been done in measuring research outcomes and providing a forum to discuss their methods, this report also considers the different methodologies used across fields of research (e. g., agriculture and energy research) to identifies which are applicable to a range of federal S&T funding...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{theory and}} evidence from recent studies into the contributions {{to economic growth}} of expenditure on education and <b>on</b> <b>research</b> and development. Investment in human capital has fundamentally different economic attributes to physical investment - exhibiting complementarity, positive feedback and non-rivalry - implying the potential to enhance economic growth over a long time period. In the case of education, there are debates over whether changes in educational attainment ultimately affect the long-run growth rate of the economy, or only the long-run level of output. The macroeconomic evidence on level effects is consistent with microeconomic estimates of private rates of return to schooling. It appears, however, that there are also significant long-term growth effects the more educated is the workforce, the better is it able to implement technological advances.

40|$|Micronutrient {{malnutrition}} is {{a serious}} problem in many developing countries. Recently, agricultural technologies have been discussed as a complement to other intervention programs. Plant breeding, targeted at developing staple foods with higher contents of essential vitamins and trace minerals, could benefit the poor in particular. Yet, the economic repercussions of such innovations are still unclear. Because traditional models of technology assessment are inappropriate to capture the specific ramifications, we suggest a health economics approach. Herein, micronutrient malnutrition is understood as a phenomenon that causes health costs through diseases and premature deaths. Details of the methodology are discussed within an ex ante study of Golden Rice in the Philippines. This technology promises to reduce vitamin A deficiency among the local population. Although it will not completely eliminate the problem, the expected benefits are sizeable. Depending on the underlying assumptions, internal rates of <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>research</b> investments range between 66 % and 133 %.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Successful {{innovation}} requires organisations {{to promote the}} utilisation of both technology and knowledge amongst the diverse actors who operate within innovation eco-systems. Many of these programmes utilise public funds to drive innovation and engage stakeholders. These public funded programmes come under increasing scrutiny to demonstrate impact as a <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>research</b> investment. Knowledge generated within the UK low carbon energy innovation system {{has the potential to}} facilitate the achievement of national and supra-national emission targets. Research and practical application in this field has historically centred on technology transfer whilst under-emphasising the crucial role of knowledge within this complex, socio-technical innovation system. This paper presents the results of a qualitative case study undertaken within a knowledge intensive public-private partnership as a component of its knowledge management strategy. The study aimed to explore the perceptions of staff relating to the organisation’s knowledge activities prior to a planned stakeholder engagement event. Fourteen semi-structured interviews were undertaken, and thematic network analysis applied to reveal four major themes. The analysis shows that wider system influences affect how actors perceive their role within the innovation system. Implications for the organisation’s managers are herein suggested which could add value to the organisation and increase knowledge utilisation amongst stakeholder groups. Implications include: clarifying utilisation objectives; tailoring knowledge activities; and introducing ongoing feedback cycles. This paper provides a foundation for future empirical work, which aims to compare knowledge utilisation within different organisational structures and identify best practice within the UK low carbon innovation system...|$|R
