40|$|A {{survey of}} 112 workers of a silk facory near Bangalore, for {{dermatologic}} diseases revealed (1) a characteristic wearing {{off of the}} medial halves of the distal free edges of the finger nail plates in 10 of the 15 cocoonsorters, (2) maceration of the palms in 58 workers of the boiling and <b>reeling</b> <b>section,</b> and (3) pitted keratolysis of the palms, in 42 workers, also from the boiling and <b>reeling</b> <b>section.</b> There was no clinical evidence of contact dermatitis, and patch tests with the silk thread from the cocoons in 25 workers showed a very mild reaction in 2 workers and a doubtful reaction in another two. In addition, one worker from the skeining section had crisscross superficial fissures on the finger tips caused by friction, two workers had paronychia ′of the fingers and four workers had dermatophytFNx 01 t fingers webs. As in the previous survey, these workers also had {{a high incidence of}} ichthyosis (92 workers) and hyperketatosis of the palms (62 workers) and soles (110 workers) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} 106 workers (96 females and 10 males) in a silk factory near Bangalore (Karnataka) {{revealed}} {{a very high}} incidence of ichthyosis (58. 4 %) and palmar (61. 3 %) and plantar (78. 3 %) keratoderma. Both these genetic disorders were almost equally prevalent in different sections of the silk factory and thus were considered not {{to be related to}} the occupational work. However, maceration of the hands, palmar pitted keratolysis and dermatophytic infection of the hands were seen only in the boiling and <b>reeling</b> <b>section</b> where the workers have to immerse their hands in an alkaline water throughout their duty hours. Candidial paronychia and contact dermatitis were not seen...|$|E
50|$|Upon purchase, {{the film}} {{comprised}} five <b>reels.</b> Some <b>sections</b> were joined with masking tape. The OHS applied for grants to digitize the film, which is 83 minutes long. A film score {{was created by}} David Yeagley and performed by students at Oklahoma City University. The film was shown at Fort Larned National Historic Site in 2013.|$|R
40|$|The {{digitized}} {{material is}} {{a guide to}} a microfilm collection, Shadan hōjin Tōgyō Kyōkai shozō Shokuminchiki Taiwan sangyō, keizai kankei shiryō maikuro-ban shūsei. The collection includes part one, with 34 microfilm reels, and part two, with 17 reels. The guide is organized by topic, with a table of contents at the front. Each section of the guide contains descriptions of content with <b>section,</b> <b>reel,</b> and slide numbers for each item.

50|$|It {{was thought}} to be a lost film, until 2013, when an {{original}} copy of The Cave of the Silken Web was discovered in the archives of the National Library in Mo i Rana, Norway. The film was presented at the Films from the South 2013 festival in Oslo. Roughly three quarters of the film is preserved, the first <b>reel</b> and a <b>section</b> in the middle is lost. The Norwegian copy has retained the original Chinese intertitles, but includes additional jokes in Norwegian written for the local audience.|$|R
5000|$|Apparently, in 1948 Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel, who {{was then}} also in charge of Information Ministry, {{on a visit to}} the Cine Laboratories Bombay, asked Badami to help set up a News <b>Reel</b> and Documentary <b>section.</b> The Films Division was {{established}} in 1948. He became chief producer in the newsreel department and made several documentaries. He worked in the Films Division making documentaries from 1948-1952. After that he stopped making films and returned to Bangalore to retire as [...] "I was a forgotten man in the feature film world". He died in 2005 in Bangalore, Karnataka, India.|$|R
2500|$|The {{failure of}} Galileo high-gain antenna meant that data storage {{to the tape}} {{recorder}} for later compression and playback was absolutely crucial {{in order to obtain}} any substantial information from the flybys of Jupiter and its moons. In October 1995, Galileo four-track, 114-megabyte digital tape recorder, which was manufactured by Odetics Corporation, remained stuck in rewind mode for 15 hours before engineers learned what had happened and sent commands to shut it off. Though the recorder itself was still in working order, the malfunction possibly damaged a length of tape {{at the end of the}} <b>reel.</b> This <b>section</b> of tape was subsequently declared [...] "off limits" [...] to any future data recording, and was covered with 25 more turns of tape to secure the section and reduce any further stresses, which could tear it. Because it happened only weeks before Galileo entered orbit around Jupiter, the anomaly prompted engineers to sacrifice data acquisition of almost all of the Io and Europa observations during the orbit insertion phase, in order to focus solely on recording data sent from the Jupiter probe descent.|$|R
