According {{to the material}} removal mechanisms during the fluid magnetic abrasive finishing process, the acoustic emission generation and characteristics are predicted analytically {{to be dominated by}} the interactions between the surface asperities and the abrasive particles. Moreover, the interactions and corresponding acoustic emission events will become weaker as the finishing process progresses and the surface becomes smoother. Experimental studies show that the amplitude and the occurrence rate of continuous acoustic emission waves and intermediate bursts reduce gradually with the progression of the finishing process. Based on these features, <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>squared</b> <b>values</b> and burst occurrence rates, being of the lowest computational requirements, are suggested as online monitoring parameters for an automated and intelligent finishing in fluid magnetic abrasive manufacturing.

In this study, we investigated how whole body vibration treatments affect electromyographic signal of rectus femoris during static and dynamic squat exercises. The aim was the identification of squat exercise characteristics useful to maximize neuromuscular activation and hence progress in training efficacy.

40|$|Abstract: Considering the {{multiple}} and complicated driving conditions for tracked vehicles and their structural features, a comprehensive intelligent control method {{to deal with}} semi-active suspension was proposed {{based on the principle}} of magneto rheological damper. One half of the tracked vehicle suspension system is taken as the research object, where analysis is directed to the vertical amplitude, pitch angle and vertical body acceleration response. And the magneto rheological damper was taken as an actuator, the fuzzy control was taken as feedforward and PID control was taken as feedback. The control system model has been established by using of the complex random road output to simulink due to the condition of MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results show that it is of good real-time control competence, good robustness and high accuracy, etc. Contrasting to passive suspension, some capability parameters such as the body vertical amplitude, pitch angle and the body vertical acceleration of the semi-active suspension system can had been well controlled by using of the intelligent hybrid control method, for exmple, the <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>value</b> of vertical amplitude decreased by 37. 2 %，the <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>value</b> of pitch angle decreased by 45. 2 % and <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>value</b> of the vertical vibration acceleration decreased by 38. 6 %. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of using the so-called Statically Equivalent Serial Chain approach to estimate the subject-specific 3 D whole-body centre of mass (CoM) location. This approach is based on a compact formulation of the 3 D whole-body CoM position associated with a least squares identification process. This process requires a calibration phase that uses stereophotogrammetric and dynamometric data collected in selected static postures. After this calibration phase, the instantaneous position of the identified subject-specific 3 D whole-body CoM can be estimated for any motor task using kinematic data only. This approach was experimentally validated on twelve healthy young subjects. The Statically Equivalent Serial Chain solution was validated during static trials with the centre of pressure, with the double integrated ground reaction forces during dynamic tasks, and also compared with a segmental method using a stereophotogrammetric system and anthropometric tables. Considerations relative to the choice of algorithm parameters, such as the number of necessary static postures and their time duration, are discussed. The proposed method shows much smaller differences between the projection of the centre of mass and the centre of pressure (<b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>value</b> under 3. 5 %) than the method using anthropometric tables (<b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>value</b> over 9 %).

40|$|Comparative {{examination}} on {{the accuracy}} of quantitative analysis for sulfide minerals by the electron probe microanalyser {{has been carried out}} by the authors in these three years. Several results have been already reported in the first three papers of this series. The effect of the standard samples on {{the accuracy of}} analysis, and the relations between the accuracy, explained as relative error to the correct value, and an amount of correction (correction coefficient) are discussed in detail in this fourth report. As mutual relations exist cosely between relative errores and amounts of correction, the small amount of correction is desirable if possible. From the results of this examination, reasonable analytical data with acceptable accuracy will be given by using three component sulfide minerals as standard sample and the <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>value</b> of the relative error is 1. 29 %, then the error will be expected within 2. 0 % at the most.

Eighteen healthy subjects concurrently performed a single 90 s isometric contraction of a controlled forceful hand grip task and full elbow extension.
