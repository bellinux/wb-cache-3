2500|$|Jackman {{has said}} he [...] "always loved acting but when I started at drama school I was like the dunce of the class. It just wasn't coming <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Everyone was cooler, {{everyone}} seemed more likely to succeed, everyone seemed more natural at it and in retrospect I think that is good. I think {{it is good to}} come from behind as an actor. I think it is good to go into an audition thinking 'Man I've got to be at my best to get this gig.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2003, it was {{announced}} that the show would be remade for the American market. The remake would be scripted by Spike Feresten, who previously wrote for US sitcoms Seinfeld and The Simpsons. Ferensten stated: [...] "I was raised Catholic and this show just felt <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> The essence of the show is about men who are also priests and, as men, they have many foibles." [...] Hat Trick founders Denise O'Donoghue and Jimmy Mulville were set to produce. The US production company was Pariah Productions, which previously adapted The Kumars at No. 42 for an American audience.|$|E
2500|$|Chocolate Castles {{graphics}} and music received mixed responses. Game Tunnel's reviewers were divided; Prince said [...] "In Chocolate Castle we've got a slickly presented puzzle game polished to a sparkling shine", but John Bardinelli disagreed and stated the game [...] "doesn't {{look like much}} at first glance". William Usher described the graphics as [...] "simplistic", and the chip tune music as [...] "nothing but 80's-gaming incarnate". Tim W. praised the graphics as [...] "sharp", but stated that the game's lack of music during play was his only complaint; [...] "some people can do without it, but it doesn't feel <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> without background music." [...] Yu said [...] "Joseph White’s games are always brimming with charm and atmosphere, and Chocolate Castle is no exception!" [...] Ochs said [...] "This game's graphics, music, and sound effects won't blow you away, but they still exude a retro charm reminiscent of 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System games".|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, sir? But {{you have}} no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in that style. You know that {{you have no}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> call <b>me</b> by my name in that way!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is no one. But, Mr Carbury, {{you have}} no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> {{question}} <b>me.</b> I don't think it generous. I allow you to say things that nobody else could say {{because you are a}} cousin and because mamma trusts you so much. No one but mamma has a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> ask <b>me</b> whether I care for any one.' ...|$|R
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of The Elephant Man and Dune, which are set in Victorian London and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the United States, and he has stated that [...] "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to, you know, make American films." [...] A number of his works, including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that [...] "It was a fantastic decade {{in a lot of}} ways... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were for a disastrous future." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Demand of {{yourself}}! How {{much do you}} {{demand of}} yourself of what I'm talking about? Not even 10 percent, some of you. ... I {{want to know how}} you can dedicate yourself to your forthcoming positions in the musical world, when you can't dedicate yourself right now to what you're doing in a simple little march. ... The world is full of people who do things just about right. Just about. And a few on the top do them just right—most of the time. Nobody's perfect! When are you going to start to demand of yourself what I demand of myself? When {{are you going to be}} as uncompromising with what you do as I am uncompromising in what I hear and what I insist on? When? Are you waiting for some miracle? The miracle will be when you demand of yourself everything you've got of yourself. That'll be the day. And I don't only mean 5 minutes of 10; I mean 10 minutes out of 10; I mean 60 minutes out of an hour, 24 hours a day, at least all of your waking hours. ... I don't want it just about <b>right!</b> <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> just about right is terrible! ... Now, nobody's killed when you play a half-note as a dotted quarter. But you might, from learning to play a half-note a full half-note, make the difference in the lives of 50,000 little kids. ... You don't piddle with music—it's a good-time-Charlie business, and for me, the wonderful good times come out of hearing somebody play beautifully. I don't care if it's ‘Stars and Stripes,’ ‘The Victors’ or what it is. I mean, there's a pride. And this guy knows he's good! And nobody can take that away from him. When they play sloppy and don't care or don't know—a great many of them don't even know, they don't know how bad it is—they can be forgiven, but more they should be pitied.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] exclaimed Blacky {{under his}} breath. [...] "Those look {{to me as}} if they might be very handy, very handy indeed, for a hunter to sit on. Sitting there behind those bushes, he would be hidden from any Duck who might come in to look for nice yellow corn {{scattered}} out there among the rushes. It doesn't look <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> No, Sir, it doesn't look <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I think I'll keep an eye on this place." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{was very}} unjust {{to you on}} the night of that dance. You were <b>right</b> <b>to</b> speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as you did, and I was very foolish. I regret what I said, and I beg you to forgive me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's got no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> treat <b>me</b> like that. My money's as good {{as anyone}} else's. I pay him <b>to</b> teach <b>me.</b> That's not {{teaching}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look here, I'm {{not going}} to be ordered about like a dog. You've got no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like that. I came out here of my own free will, and I won't let you treat me like a damned nigger.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... (He rises suddenly, {{takes her}} two hands in his, leads her gently to her chair, seats her, and reseats himself in desk-chair.) Listen. It {{is not your}} husband. But I {{have no right to}} you. Nor have you a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} be ashamed of yourself," [...] said Lemuel, trying to summon an indignant feeling, and {{laughing}} with a strange pleasure at heart. [...] "You've got no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that way. I want you should leave me alone!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Most {{every night}} of my life, sir," [...] {{the old man}} replied, [...] "from eight till nine. I'm a man of regular habits, and that do seem <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that with the work done right and proper a man should have his relaxation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] His {{voice sounded}} rather doubtful. [...] "The fact is, Bertie, it doesn't look quite <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> There's {{something}} about it--My uncle's coming {{in half an}} hour to inspect it, and--I don't know why it is, but I kind of feel I'd like your moral support!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{kept away}} from the studio for some time after that, because it didn't seem <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to intrude on the poor chappie's sorrow. Besides, I'm bound to say that nurse intimidated me. She {{reminded}} me so infernally of Aunt Agatha. She was the same gimlet-eyed type.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{it would}} be all <b>right</b> <b>to</b> give <b>me</b> away, I suppose, and let him {{understand}} that I had violated professional confidence?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are forgetting yourself, Count di Marioni, {{and your}} speech is a presumption. We have been friends, but, {{if you wish}} our {{friendship}} to continue, you will alter your tone.

60|$|He {{went off}} agin, and, arter {{going to the}} Bull's Head and 'aving a pint to clear my 'ead, I went {{and sat down in}} the office and thought it over.
