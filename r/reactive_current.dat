50|$|The crowbar will {{short-circuit}} {{the rotor}} windings {{through a small}} resistance when excessive currents or voltages are detected. In {{order to be able}} to continue the operation as quickly as possible an active crowbar has to be used. The active crowbar can remove the rotor short in a controlled way and thus the rotor side converter can be started only after 20-60 ms from the start of the grid disturbance when the remaining voltage stays above 15% of the nominal voltage. Thus it is possible to generate <b>reactive</b> <b>current</b> to the grid during the rest of the voltage dip and in this way help the grid to recover from the fault. For zero voltage ride through it is common to wait until the dip ends because with zero voltage it is not possible to know the phase angle where the <b>reactive</b> <b>current</b> should be injected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Active power filters play an {{important}} role when power quality is concerned. Shunt active power filters are used for filtering harmonic and <b>reactive</b> <b>currents</b> in electric systems driving nonlinear and reactive loads. These filters permit the reduction of power losses, electromagnetic interferences and other problems that may arise from the existence of excessive harmonic and <b>reactive</b> <b>currents</b> in electric systems. This research presents a current controller with three-dimensional (3 -D) space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) for active power filters used in four-wire unbalanced systems. Many techniques of current control are widely known for three-wire balanced systems but very few works explain current control techniques for unbalanced systems with a neutral conductor. This paper explains in detail a four-wire current controller using a conventional three-leg voltage source inverter and makes a comparison of its performance with the performance of the well-known hysteresis-based current controller...|$|R

Reactive power from {{a capacitor}} bank decreases when grid voltage decreases, while a synchronous condenser can increase <b>reactive</b> <b>current</b> as voltage decreases. However, synchronous machines have higher energy losses than static capacitor banks. Most synchronous condensers connected to electrical grids are rated between 20 MVAr (megavars) and 200 MVAr and many are hydrogen cooled.

5000|$|An over-excited {{synchronous}} motor has a leading power factor. This makes it useful for {{power factor correction}} of industrial loads. Both transformers and induction motors draw lagging (magnetising) currents from the line. On light loads, the power drawn by induction motors has a large reactive component and the power factor has a low value. The added current flowing to supply reactive power creates additional losses in the power system. In an industrial plant, {{synchronous motor}}s {{can be used to}} supply some of the reactive power required by induction motors. This improves the plant power factor and reduces the <b>reactive</b> <b>current</b> required from the grid.|$|E
50|$|If an {{ordinary}} switch {{is used to}} control the winding current, this can cause sparks at the terminals of the switch. This doesn't occur when the magnet is switched on, because the voltage {{is limited to the}} power supply voltage, but when it is switched off, the energy in the magnetic field is suddenly returned to the circuit, causing a large voltage spike and an arc across the switch contacts, which can damage them. With small electromagnets a capacitor is often used across the contacts, which reduces arcing by temporarily storing the current. More often a diode is used to prevent voltage spikes by providing a path for the current to recirculate through the winding until the energy is dissipated as heat. The diode is connected across the winding, oriented so it is reverse-biased during steady state operation and doesn't conduct. When the supply voltage is removed, the voltage spike forward-biases the diode and the <b>reactive</b> <b>current</b> continues to flow through the winding, through the diode and back into the winding. A diode used in this way is called a flyback diode.|$|E

50|$|In any {{alternating}} current transmission line, the inductance and capacitance of the conductors can be significant. Currents that flow solely in ‘reaction’ to these {{properties of the}} circuit, (which together with the resistance define the impedance) constitute reactive power flow, which transmits no ‘real’ power to the load. These reactive currents, however, are very real and cause extra heating losses in the transmission circuit. The ratio of 'real' power (transmitted to the load) to 'apparent' power (the product of a circuit's voltage and current, without reference to phase angle) is the power factor. As <b>reactive</b> <b>current</b> increases, the reactive power increases and the power factor decreases. For transmission systems with low power factor, losses are higher than for systems with high power factor. Utilities add capacitor banks, reactors and other components (such as phase-shifting transformers; static VAR compensators; and flexible AC transmission systems, FACTS) throughout the system help {{to compensate for the}} reactive power flow, reduce the losses in power transmission and stabilize system voltages. These measures are collectively called 'reactive support'.|$|E
50|$|As in a {{synchronous}} motor, the stator of {{the machine}} is connected to a three-phase supply of voltage Vs (assumed to be constant), and this creates a rotating magnetic field within the machine. Likewise, the rotor is excited with a DC current (Ie) {{to act as an}} electromagnet. In normal operation the rotor magnet follows the stator field at synchronous speed. The rotating electromagnet induces a three-phase voltage (Vg) in the stator windings as if the machine were a synchronous generator. If the machine is considered to be ideal, with no mechanical, magnetic, or electrical losses, its equivalent circuit will be an AC generator in series with the winding inductance (L) of the stator. The magnitude of Vg depends on the excitation current (Ie) and the speed of rotation, and as the latter is fixed, Vg depends only on Ie. If Ie is critically adjusted to a value Ie0, Vg will be equal and opposite to Vs, and the current in the stator (Is) will be zero. This corresponds to the minimum in the curve shown above. If, however, Ie is increased above Ie0, Vg will exceed Vs, and the difference is accounted for by a voltage (Vl) appearing across the stator inductance L: Vl = Is x Xl where Xl is the stator reactance. Now the stator current (Is) is no longer zero. Since the machine is ideal, Vg, Vl and Vs will all be in phase, and Is will be entirely reactive (i.e. in phase quadrature). Viewed from the supply side {{of the machine}}'s terminals, a negative <b>reactive</b> <b>current</b> will flow out of the terminals, and the machine will therefore appear as a capacitor, the magnitude of whose reactance will fall as Ir increases above Is0. If Ie is adjusted to be less than Ie0, Vs will exceed Vg, and a positive <b>reactive</b> <b>current</b> will flow into the machine. The machine will then appear as an inductor whose reactance falls as Ie is reduced further. These conditions correspond to the two rising arms of the V-curves (above). In a practical machine with losses, the equivalent circuit will contain a resistor in parallel with the terminals to represent mechanical and magnetic losses, and another resistor in series with the generator and L, representing copper losses in the stator. Thus in a practical machine Is will contain a small in-phase component, and will not fall to zero.|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} of the DFIG is that rotor windings {{are connected to the}} grid via slip rings and back-to-back voltage source converter that controls both the rotor and the grid currents.

By using the converter to control the rotor currents, it is possible to adjust the active and reactive power fed to the grid from the stator independently of the generator's turning speed. The control principle used is either the two-axis current vector control or direct torque control (DTC).
