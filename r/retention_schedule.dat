5000|$|Logging as {{a service}} (LaaS) is an IT {{architectural}} model for centrally ingesting and collecting any type of log files coming from any given source or location; such as servers, applications, devices etc. The files are [...] "normalized" [...] or filtered for reformatting and forwarding to other dependent systems to be processed as “native” data, which can then be managed, displayed and ultimately disposed of according to a predesignated <b>retention</b> <b>schedule</b> based on any number of criteria.|$|E
5000|$|Disposal {{of records}} {{does not always}} mean [...] It can also include {{transfer}} to a historical archive, museum, or private individual. Destruction of records ought to be authorized by law, statute, regulation, or operating procedure, and the records should be disposed of with care to avoid inadvertent disclosure of information. The process needs to be well-documented, starting with a records <b>retention</b> <b>schedule</b> and policies and procedures that have been approved at the highest level. An inventory of the records disposed of should be maintained, including certification {{that they have been}} destroyed. Records should never simply be discarded as refuse. Most organizations use processes including pulverization, paper shredding or incineration.|$|E
50|$|An {{inactive}} record {{is a record}} {{that is no longer}} needed to conduct current business but is being preserved until it meets the end of its retention period, such as when a project ends, a product line is retired, or the end of a fiscal reporting period is reached. These records may hold business, legal, fiscal, or historical value for the entity in the future and, therefore, are required to be maintained for a short or permanent duration. Records are managed according to the <b>retention</b> <b>schedule.</b> Once the life of a record has been satisfied according to its predetermined period and there are no legal holds pending, it is authorized for final disposition, which may include destruction, transfer, or permanent preservation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Retention</b> <b>schedules</b> are an {{important}} aspect of records management. Many organizations are subject to rules and regulations (at the local, state or federal level) that govern for how long they are required to keep records before they can safely dispose of them.

5000|$|The Privacy Commissioner's {{report was}} tabled June 5, 2013. In the report, the Commissioner stated [...] "While I cannot state with {{certainty}} that emails had been deleted improperly {{by the former}} Premier’s staff during {{the transition to the}} new Premier in an effort to avoid transparency and accountability, it strains credulity that no one knew that the practice of deleting all emails was not in compliance with applicable records management and retention policies.". The report found [...] "the practice of indiscriminate deletion of all emails sent and received by the former Chief of Staff was in violation of the Archives and Recordkeeping Act, 2006 (ARA) and the records <b>retention</b> <b>schedule</b> developed by Archives of Ontario for ministers’ offices. In my view, this practice also undermined the purposes of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act F(FIPPA), and the transparency and accountability principles that form the foundation of both Acts. It truly strains credulity to think that absolutely no records responsive to the Estimates Committee motion and the Speaker’s ruling were retained." ...|$|E
5000|$|Long-term {{records are}} those that are {{identified}} to have a continuing value to an organization. Based on the period assigned in the <b>retention</b> <b>schedule,</b> these may be held for periods of 25 years or longer, or may even be assigned a retention period of [...] "indefinite" [...] or [...] "permanent". The term [...] "permanent" [...] is used much less frequently outside of the Federal Government, as it is not feasible to establish a requirement for such a retention period. There is a need to ensure records of a continuing value are managed using methods that ensure they remain persistently accessible for length of the time they are retained. While this is relatively easy to accomplish with paper or microfilm based records by providing appropriate environmental conditions and adequate protection from potential hazards, it is less simple for electronic format records. There are unique concerns related to ensuring the format they are generated/captured in remains viable and the media they are stored on remains accessible. Media is subject to both degradation and obsolescence over its lifespan, and therefore, policies and procedures must be established for the periodic conversion and migration of information stored electronically to ensure it remains accessible for its required retention periods.|$|E
5000|$|Disposition is the {{practice}} of handling information that is less frequently accessed or has met its assigned retention periods. Less frequently accessed records may be considered for relocation to an inactive records facility until they have met their assigned retention period. [...] "Although {{a small percentage of}} organizational information never loses its value, the value of most information tends to decline over time until it has no further value to anyone for any purpose. The value of nearly all business information is greatest soon after it is created and generally remains active for only a short time --one to three years or so-- after which its importance and usage declines. The record then makes its life cycle transition to a semi-active and finally to an inactive state." [...] Retention periods are based on the creation of an organization-specific <b>retention</b> <b>schedule,</b> based on research of the regulatory, statutory and legal requirements for management of information for the industry in which the organization operates. Additional items to consider when establishing a retention period are any business needs that may exceed those requirements and consideration of the potential historic, intrinsic or enduring value of the information. If the information has met all of these needs and is no longer considered to be valuable, it should be disposed of by means appropriate for the content. This may include ensuring that others cannot obtain access to outdated or obsolete information as well as measures for protection privacy and confidentiality.|$|E

40|$|A six month project under Theme 1 A of the JISC 09 / 02 call {{to produce}} a <b>retention</b> <b>schedule</b> for records {{relating}} to the Personnel Management Function, using the Revised Study of the Records Lifecycle and {{a report on the}} projects methodology and findings. Executive Summary It is a mark {{of the success of the}} Revised Study of the Records Lifecycle that both the JISC Function and Activity Model and Records <b>Retention</b> <b>Schedule</b> advice were adopted with a good degree of success. Both the model and retention advice were found to be sufficient in scope and detail, and issues surrounding the application of advice and development of an institutional schedule centred on interpretation and method (surveying, presentation and role of the schedule). The Function and Activity model has many benefits but the apparent relevance of some functional designations could be misleading if the functioning of the model or the records is not given sufficient attention. The model becomes easier to apply when looked at ‘in the round ’ and with reference to the records <b>retention</b> <b>schedule.</b> The retention advice relating to HR records did not generally conflict with current practice and acted as an important starting point for discussion of retention, filing methods and digital preservation, particularly in the light of the DPA. The depth of surveying and a tension between the need to address issues of duplication, version control, filing method and potential electronic document management (requiring a good understanding of workflow and the current filing/retention of documents and series) and the need for a schedule not to simply reflect current practice in detail but provide guidance to move systems forward is a common theme addressed in the report. It was decided that the <b>retention</b> <b>schedule</b> should not be a static document or one that sits in isolation from other information and management resources. The project flags ways in which the schedule can be integrated at strategic and practical levels whilst highlighting some of the organisational issues faced in beginning an institutional schedul...|$|E
