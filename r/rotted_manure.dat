50|$|No-dig methods allow {{nature to}} carry out {{cultivation}} operations. Organic matter such as well <b>rotted</b> <b>manure,</b> compost, leaf mold, spent mushroom compost, old straw, etc., is added directly to the soil surface as a mulch at least 5-15 centimeters (2-6 in) deep, which is then incorporated {{by the actions of}} worms, insects and microbes. Worms and other soil life also assist in building up the soil's structure, their tunnels providing aeration and drainage, and their excretions bind together soil crumbs. This natural biosphere maintains healthy conditions in the upper soil horizons where annual plant roots thrive. No-dig systems are said to be freer of pests and disease, possibly due to a more balanced soil population being allowed to build up in this undisturbed environment, and by encouraging the buildup of beneficial rather than harmful soil fungi. Moisture is also retained more efficiently under mulch than on the surface of bare earth, allowing slower percolation and less leaching of nutrients.|$|E
5000|$|A {{magazine}} {{published in}} Britain during WWII described an incubator as [...] "a wooden box, hot water, and a curtain". One {{of the first}} recorded methods of incubating included using the heat of <b>rotted</b> <b>manure</b> to warm the eggs. The Egyptians had a better method of incubating that used a cylindrical building that had a fire {{at the bottom of}} the building. The eggs that were incubating were placed on an inverted cone that was partially covered in ash. The eggs were placed in a woven basket that sat on top of the ashes. The building also had a roof that allowed smoke to escape, but it kept the rain out. In 400 B.C. Mechanical incubating was not invented until the year of 1749 by Reamur in Paris, France. Lyman Byce created a coal lamp incubator in 1879. [...] The first commercial machine was made by Hearson in the year of 1881.|$|E

5000|$|Typhonium venosum, {{probably}} better known under its synonym Sauromatum venosum, {{is a common}} shade-loving house or garden plant from temperate and tropical Africa and Asia. It grows to around 20 inches tall from an underground corm. A large T. venosum corm can spawn multiple new corms. Inflorescences emerge before their leaves. This plant {{is also known as}} the Voodoo Bulb because of its ability to flower from a corm without soil and water. An inflorescence has a purplish-brown-spotted, yellowish spathe and a purplish-brown spadix which emit a strong odor perceived as similar to cow <b>manure,</b> <b>rotting</b> flesh, or a dirty wet dog, depending on who smells the inflorescence. The odor lasts about 2 days, and attracts carrion-feeding insects, such as calliphorid flies and silphid beetles which can pollinate this plant.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{potentials}} of poultry, farmyard {{and refuse}} dump manures for management of Phytophthora root rot on sweet peppers, Capsicum annuum was evaluated in pot experiments under controlled conditions. Five week-old seedlings of pepper varieties were transplanted into heat sterilized soil amended with poultry, farmyard and refuse dump manures at 2, 4 and 8 tons/ha. The pots were arranged in complete randomized design with daily ambient temperature 28 Â°C and RH 93 % and pepper root rot development monitored {{over a period}} of time. The results obtained revealed that plant height, stem girth and number of fruits harvested increased proportionately with increase in poultry manure rates. Pepper root rot severity was lowered 0 %, 5 % and 57. 5 % on application of 4 tons/ha refuse dump, farmyard and poultry manures, respectively. Severity was not significantly influenced by poultry manure at 2 and 4 tons/ha. The present study lead to conclude that, pepper root rot severity became ameliorated when soil was modified with manures and these in combination with other management options can be recommended for adoption by resource poor sweet pepper cultivators.

40|$|Periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus L.) {{is one of}} the {{important}} ornamental and medicinal plants, due to the presence of the blue tint flowers and the indispensable anti-cancer drugs, vincristine and vinblastine. Therefore, the production of this plant has been emphasized. Nutritional management and application of organic and inorganic materials as substrates can {{play an important role in}} increasing the productivity and quality of this plant. Therefore, the effects of different organic materials as growing media including: <b>rotted</b> <b>manure</b> spent mushroom compost (SMC), vermicompost, and garden soli as control on the vegetative growth, yield and flower quality of Periwinkle were considered. The organic materials were in four levels (15, 30, 40 and 50 %). Analysis of variance showed that the effects of different treatments on studied properties are significant (p< 0. 001). The maximum of plant height (37. 83 cm), fresh weight of shoot (116. 55 g), number of flower (42. 67) and diameter of flower (45. 67 mm) were obtained in vermicompost 50 %. Moreover, maximum of dry weight of shoot (32. 91 g) was observed in SMC 40 %. The results showed that the application of vermicompost 50 % resulted in significant increases in concentration of N.

40|$|To {{compare the}} effect of the {{substrate}} on the cultivation of ornamental plants, Ficus benjamina cv. star light was chosen as a model plant. Nine treatments from 8 types of substrates with 6 replications were investigated in this study. Data analysis with SPSS software in (Pâ¤ 0. 05) showed {{the effect of}} different month were significant on stem diameter, height, leaf number and total length of new leaves. Also application of different substrates showed the effect of substrate wasnât significant on stem diameter and plant height, while it was significant on number of new leaf, number of new lateral shoot and total length of new leaf. The interaction between the substrates and measuring time was significant on plant height, number of new leaf and total length of new leaf, but it wasnât significant on increasing rate of stem diameter. According to the result of this study, substrate n containing [1 / 3 (3 perlite+ 1 sand) + 1 / 3 (1 leaf-mold+ 1 rice hull+ 1 cocopeat) + 1 / 3 (2 mushroom compost+ 1 forest trees compost+ 1 <b>rotted</b> <b>manure)</b> ] was the best substrate as for the most number of new leaf, number of new lateral shoots and total length of new leaf, also it was in suitable situation in height characteristic. Also in different measured month, the value of plant growth was increased with enhancement in air temperature in spring and summer seasons; insofar as the most increasing in plant height and number of new leaf were observed on July.

40|$|Sodium {{chlorate}} {{has proved}} {{the most effective}} herbicide for the eradication of leafy spurge. The following formula is effective when applied as a spray: Sodium chlorate, 1 pound; animal glue, 4 grams; sulfuric acid, 3 cubic centimeters; water, 1 gallon. The best kill was obtained when the chlorate solution was sprayed on actively growing plants in full foliage. In northwestern Iowa, sodium chlorate sprayed on the aerial parts has given better and more consistent results than when applied dry, directly to the soil. The highest percentage of kill of leafy spurge through sodium chlorate was produced when the spray was applied {{the latter part of}} May or when the plant was about to come into blossom. The second spray, applied the latter part of August or before killing frost, usually completed the eradication of leafy spurge. Sodium chlorate has proved more effective in killing leafy spurge when treated in small grain or millet than where growing alone. Leafy spurge was eliminated in a large pasture by spraying with sodium chlorate, the first application being made the latter part of May and the second the latter part of August. Pound for pound, the old Atlacide on the market in 1930 - 33 apparently was not as effective in killing leafy spurge as sodium chlorate. Dilute sulfuric acid and C. -K. (creosote-kerosene) killed the tops of leafy spurge with little injury to the roots. Heavy applications of ammonium thiocyanate may prove valuable as a herbicide for leafy spurge. Potassium chlorate was about as effective in eradicating leafy spurge as sodium chlorate. Residual soil effect was greater for potassium chlorate than for sodium chlorate. To insure complete elimination of leafy spurge by spraying with sodium chlorate, 2 years are necessary. Two applications the first year will destroy most of the spurge. Remaining plants must be given two treatments the second year. Kainite, a fertilizer, will exterminate leafy spurge when heavy applications are made. Applications of well <b>rotted</b> <b>manure</b> (3 tons to the square rod) were effective against leafy spurge. Straw had no effect. Plowing leafy spurge deeply (7 - 8 inches) in the fall and again in the spring materially reduced the amount of leafy spurge. Millet, sorghum and soybeans drilled in heavily about the middle of June after the ground had been plowed and fallowed proved to be good crops for infested areas of leafy spurge. Reduction in leafy spurge population is greater if the land is plowed the preceding fall and again the following spring, and cultivated until the smother crop is planted. Fallowing for 2 years, by cultivating 30 times each year from June 1 until Oct. 1, completely destroyed leafy spurge. A program of eradication with growing competitive crops may be shortened by giving leafy spurge one application of sodium chlorate the previous fall, shortly before killing frost. Leafy spurge population in corn was not reduced by four cultivations. Surface cultivation in corn following regular cultivation did not prove to be an effective procedure in eradicating leafy spurge. Alfalfa did not compete successfully with leafy spurge. Alfalfa was tolerant to sodium chlorate and may be used on ground where the leafy spurge has been killed with sodium chlorate or Atlacide. Barley was sensitive to sodium chlorate in the soil; soybeans are less tolerant than barley or oats...|$|E
40|$|Odor from a swine {{operation}} {{is caused by}} decomposing <b>manure,</b> <b>rotting</b> feed, incineration, dust emissions, and dead pigs. The control of odor is a significant issue for pork producers (Miner and Barth, 1988). The important aspects for neighbors are intensity, duration, and frequency of detection of the odor. To be considered a nuisance odor, it must be offensive to the senses and materially interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of property within the area. It is impossible to eliminate all odors from hog production because the technology to completely remove it either does not exist or is prohibitively expensive to install and/or to operate. Certainly, good design and management and certain odor control technologies can minimize odor, but the best control for remaining odor is to allow outdoor air movement to dilute the odor with distance. Therefore, the most critical and effective means of reducing odor complaints occurs in initial site selection. Van Kleeck and Bulley (1990) conducted a survey of neighbors around seven, 100 - to 225 -sow, farrow-to-finish operations to assess {{the relationship between the}} perception of odor nuisance, separation distance, {{and the size of the}} facility. The frequency of swine farms perceived as a nuisance was inversely proportional to the square of the separation distance. About 20 % of the neighbors living around 2200 ft away from a swine farm perceived it to be a nuisance. Farm size appeared to have n...|$|R
40|$|Type {{and rate}} of {{fertilizers}} influence the level of soil organic carbon (Corg) and total nitrogen (Nt) markedly, but the effect on C and N partitioning into different pools is open to question. The objectives of the present work were to: (i) 	quantify the impact of fertilizer type and rate on labile, intermediate and passive C and N pools by {{using a combination of}} biological, chemical and mathematical methods; (ii) 	explain previously reported differences in the soil organic matter (SOM) levels between soils receiving farmyard manure with or without biodynamic preparations by using Corg time series and information on SOM partitioning; and (iii) 	quantify the long-term and short-term dynamics of SOM in density fractions and microbial biomass as affected by fertilizer type and rate and determine the incorporation of crop residues into labile SOM fractions. Samples were taken from a sandy Cambisol from the long-term fertilization trial in Darmstadt, Germany, founded in 1980. The nine treatments (four field replicates) were: straw incorporation plus application of mineral fertilizer (MSI) and application of <b>rotted</b> farmyard <b>manure</b> with (DYN) or without (FYM) addition of biodynamic preparations, each at high (140 â 150 kg N ha- 1 year- 1; MSIH, DYNH, FYMH), medium (100 kg N ha- 1 year- 1; MSIM, DYNM, FYMM) and low (50 â 60 kg N ha- 1 year- 1; MSIL, DYNL, FYML) rates. The main findings were: (i) 	The stocks of Corg (t ha- 1) were affected by fertilizer type and rate and increased in the order MSIL (23. 6), MSIM (23. 7), MSIH (24. 2) FYML > MSIH, MSIL for all sampling dates in 2008 (March, May, September, December). However, statistical significance of treatment effects differed between the dates, probably due to dif-ferences in the spatial variation throughout the year. The high proportion of LFOC on total Corg stocks (45 â 55 %) highlighted the importance of selective preservation of OM as a stabilization mechanism in this sandy Cambisol. The apparent turnover time of LFOC was between 21 and 32 years, which agreed very well with studies with substantially longer vegetation change compared to our study. Overall, both approaches; (I) the combination of incubation, chemical fractionation and simple modelling and (II) the density fractionation; provided complementary information on the partitioning of SOM into pools of different stability. The density fractionation showed that differences in Corg stocks between FYM and MSI treatments were mainly located in the light fraction, i. e. induced by higher recalcitrance of the organic input in the FYM treatments. Moreover, the use of the combination of biological, chemical and mathematical methods indicated that effects of fertilizer rate on total Corg and Nt stocks may be short-lived, but that the effect of fertilizer type may persist for longer time spans in the sandy Cambisol.
