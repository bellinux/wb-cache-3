25|$|Stoney Creek Bridge (originally bridge number 26, now bridge 30), {{in front}} of Stoney Creek Falls, is built on a 4 chain (80m) <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> and was {{designed}} by the government engineer John Gwynneth. The design is unique in Queensland, the curve being {{the only way to}} avoid tunnelling. By the end of 1887 the concrete foundations on which the wrought iron trestles (Phoenix columns) were erected were well underway. It is one of only two Queensland railway bridges constructed with wrought iron trestles, the other being Christmas Creek Bridge, further up the line. A visit to Cairns by the Governor of Queensland, Sir Henry Wylie Norman, in April 1890 was taken as an opportunity to inspect the construction works. A marquee, covering a banquet table and open to the waterfall, had been set up on the almost completed Stoney Creek Bridge with planks laid over the sleepers. There were no speeches due to the roar of the waterfall immediately behind the bridge. The bridge passed load testing on 30 June 1890.|$|E

2500|$|Between Abbesses and Lamarck-Caulaincourt stations, {{the tunnel}} crosses Montmartre at a maximum depth of , {{close to the}} Basilica of the Sacré Cœur, making Line 12 the network's deepest. At Lamarck-Caulaincourt station, the line reaches its highest point, after which it makes a 4 per cent descent towards Jules-Joffrin station, {{situated}} under Rue Ordener, then to Marcadet-Poissoniers station, where the line again crosses Line 4. The tunnel runs underneath the railways departing from Gare du Nord, then slants northwards in a [...] <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> into Marx Dormoy station, in the Goutte d'Or neighbourhood. The line continues down a slope of 2.6 per cent, with new bends, before arriving at Porte de la Chapelle station, on {{the northern edge of}} Paris. This station was previously the northern terminus and has three lines with platforms, leading into a four-tunnel depot. Beyond the depot, a new tunnel was constructed for {{the first phase of the}} extension towards Aubervillers, passing underneath the rind road, and exiting the northern fringe of Paris for the first time. After an eastward curvature, the line arrives at Aubervillers - Front Populaire, the first modern station of Line 12. The new station is situated at the edge of Saint-Denis and Aubervilliers, and is a traditional 2-track layout with platforms on either side of the track (From [...] ).|$|E

50|$|A typical oval track {{consists}} of two parallel straights, connected by two 180° turns. Although most ovals generally have only two <b>radii</b> <b>curves,</b> they are usually advertised and labeled as four 90° turns.|$|R
50|$|Chattanooga Loop - Gibbs {{achieved}} a 550-foot {{rise in the}} line over a quarter-mile straight-line distance by a detour from Mineral Creek up Mill Creek gulch, with in a 30-degree (194-foot <b>radius)</b> <b>curve</b> looping 200 degrees at the end, and returning to Mineral Creeek, all on a 5-percent grade.|$|E

40|$|Tonal squeal noise (i. e. {{the high}} {{amplitude}} singing of a railway wheel with pure tone components) is emitted by some trailing inner wagon wheels on heavy haul trains in 1000 m <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> on the iron ore export line in South Africa. Field measurements {{have shown that}} the trailing inner wheels that squeal are subject to predominantly longitudinal creepage with little to no lateral creepage. The longitudinal creepage acting at the contact of the squealing wheels exceeds 1 %, which supports the likelihood of creep saturation and subsequently squeal due to unsteady longitudinal creepage in the large <b>radius</b> <b>curves.</b> Experimental modal analysis of the wheel types identified to be relevant to squeal has revealed that for each unstable frequency, two eigenmodes are likely to be important: one which has a large mode shape component at the wheel-rail contact in the circumferential direction and another which has a large mode shape component at the wheel-rail contact in the radial direction. A frictional self-excitation mechanism based on mode-coupling is favoured as being responsible for squeal excited in large <b>radius</b> <b>curves.</b> [URL] and Aeronautical Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|When {{some were}} {{withdrawn}} from mainline service {{and placed in}} branch line and shunting service where smaller <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> were encountered, they were modified to 4-8-2T locomotives by removing the fifth pair of coupled wheels.|$|R
50|$|A {{speculative}} plan {{to create}} a heritage railway between Reepham station and Whitwell station has been proposed by {{the owner of the}} latter station, which is being developed as a railway centre. This would include relaying the Themelthorpe Curve, built to link the former Great Eastern Railway and Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway routes - formerly the tightest <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> on the British Rail network.|$|E
50|$|Achieving {{constant}} orbital radius while {{supplying the}} proper {{accelerating electric field}} requires that the magnetic flux linking the orbit be somewhat independent of the magnetic field on the orbit, bending the particles into a constant <b>radius</b> <b>curve.</b> These machines have in practice been limited by the large radiative losses suffered by the electrons moving at nearly {{the speed of light}} in a relatively small radius orbit.|$|E
50|$|This bridge, located west of Yosemite, was {{necessitated by}} a new highway {{alignment}} the resulted from creation of the new Don Pedro Dam reservoir. James Roberts laid out the bridge on a horizontal curve with a 1,200 foot <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> to meet the requests of the highway engineers. Large bridges of this size were normally built straight, and California bridges required a detailed seismic analysis.|$|E
50|$|On30 {{model railway}} gauge is {{regarded}} as the fastest growing in the O scale (dated 2013). Because narrow-gauge railways models can also round tight <b>radius</b> <b>curves,</b> it is allowing layouts be built in confined spaces at home.|$|R
25|$|In {{general the}} TTT Co line was {{constructed}} to a fairly high standard for a bush tramway, with 1 in 30 grades and 30 metre <b>radius</b> <b>curves.</b> This reflected the company's ultimate intention {{to sell the}} line to NZR.|$|R
50|$|The line is laid with 30kg/m rail with an {{axle load}} of 15.75 tonnes. The maximum grade is 1 in 50 (2%) and the minimum <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> are 160m. The line speed is 50km/h to Brookstead, and 30km/h beyond.|$|R
50|$|There were {{a number}} of timber viaducts on the line from the beginning. The River Neath viaduct at the {{southern}} end of the line was 810 feet in length; it was replaced in 1875 partly by embankment. There were three other crossings of the River Neath using timber viaduct construction. Pencaedrain Viaduct between Glyn Neath and Hirwaun had eight spans on a 30 chain <b>radius</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
50|$|As described, cant {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} lateral {{acceleration}} on trains traveling on curved track. This is to balance the centrifugal force (force pushing outward the curve) and centripetal force (force pushing inward the curve). At a higher speed, the centrifugal force is higher. On the contrary, higher cant creates the higher centripetal force. The calculation for this assumes a constant train speed on a constant <b>radius</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
50|$|The line descended at a {{grade of}} 1 in 15, {{passing through the}} 396 ft long Horseshoe Gully Tunnel (later Siberia Tunnel). On leaving the tunnel, the line crossed the gully on a high earth and rock {{embankment}}, the largest on the section, on a five-chain <b>radius</b> <b>curve.</b> The embankment was about 180 to 200 ft wide at its base, and around 90 ft high at its centre line.|$|E
50|$|The line beyond Lota was rebuilt to {{contemporary}} standards (50 kg/m rail, maximum 1 in 50 (2%) grades and minimum 430 m <b>radius</b> <b>curves)</b> and reopened {{on the original}} alignment to Thorneside in 1982 and the line was electrified in 1983.|$|R
5000|$|For an 00-9 or H0e pizza, using 9mm gauge {{and either}} 4mm or 3.5mm scale, a {{workable}} minimum <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> is 6", for an overall baseboard diameter of 15 in, within the pizza box format. Some model companies, such as Tomix, even produce extra-small <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> of 4" [...] radius, for modelling trams. These {{have been used}} to model at N gauge within a 9" [...] baseboard.|$|R
50|$|At {{least two}} motor coaches, M28247M and M28282M, were rebuilt with flush panels and windows with large <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> {{to the lower}} corners, giving them a more modern appearance. The {{reason for this is}} unknown, but {{it may have been a}} war-damage repair.|$|R
50|$|The line {{is still}} open, with rail of 30 kg/m relaid for about 50% of the line, with the balance being 21 kg/m. Steel {{sleepers}} have been installed {{at a rate}} of 1 in 4 to 1 in 3, and the maximum axle load is 15.75 tonnes. The maximum grade is 1 in 50 (2%), the minimum <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> is 200m, and the line speed is 30 km/h.|$|E
50|$|There were 350 viaducts and underbridges and 50 overbridges on the Fort William section. The longest viaduct is on Rannoch Moor at 684 feet in nine spans of 70 feet 6 inches, {{partly on}} a 12 chain <b>radius</b> <b>curve.</b> On the Banavie branch the viaduct {{over the river}} Lochy, {{consisting}} of four 80 feet spans, required cast iron cylinders to be sunk for {{the founding of the}} piers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coastal route}} was {{approved}} in 1889, with construction starting from both Caboolture and Gympie, and the linking section opened in 1891.

50|$|The siting of the troughs {{requires}} a long enough length of straight and level track (although very large <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> could be accommodated). There {{must be a}} good water supply nearby. In hard water areas, water softening plant may have been considered necessary.|$|R
50|$|A 229 km {{line from}} Almaden to Forsayth (the Etheridge railway) opened between 1909-1910 to provide {{additional}} ore for the Chillagoe smelter. It was built with 21 kg/m (42 lb/yd) rails, 1 in 40 grades, 4 chain (~88m) <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> and low level bridges.|$|R
